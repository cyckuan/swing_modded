 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
FORT WORTH _ Eighteen Winston Cup drivers are trying to get in the
field for the Busch Grand National race at Texas Motor Speedway on
Saturday, but it was a former World of Outlaws sprint-car champion
who earned the top spot.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It didn't take long Thursday to see the reconfigured racing
surface at TMS meant faster speeds on the 1.5 mile tri-oval, and
Dave Blaney led the way by winning the pole in Busch qualifying for
Saturday's Coca-Cola 300.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old Ohio native guided the Amoco Pontiac to a lap at
183.082 mph, easily surpassing the Busch record at TMS of 180.054
mph that Mark Green set in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing was we didn't make any mistakes for an entire
lap, which we didn't do in practice,'' said Blaney, the World of
Outlaws champ in 1995. ``But that was a little better and faster
than we expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine drivers bettered the old mark, including Mark Martin,
18-year-old Adam Petty and Jeff Gordon. Martin will start next to
Blaney on the front row, and Petty will be inside of Gordon on row
2.
</P>
<P>
   The increased speeds were a result of the $3 million worth of
renovations on the track last spring after the 1998 NASCAR weekend
when complaints about the racing surface continued from the
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The track was completely reconfigured by leveling off the
banking transition, widening the entrance and exit to the
frontstretch, and adding a new drainage system to control a water
seepage problem.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers agree the changes are a success, but they learned
Thursday that the increased speeds have caused a new concern. The
cars are able to hold speed entering turn 1, but it has made things
a little tricky getting through turn 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are carrying so much speed coming off turn 1 that you need
to pay attention to stay out of trouble,'' Blaney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the frontstretch feels like Atlanta (Motor Speedway),
but turns 2 and 3 are a little different. The banking falls off and
it gets flat on you real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Things could get interesting today when the Winston Cup cars
will be on the track, because those cars usually are at least five
mph faster than the Busch cars.
</P>
<P>
   But Busch rookie Adam Petty, the grandson of Richard Petty and
the son of Winston Cup driver Kyle Petty, said any potential
problem lies with the drivers, not the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``People came here this year expecting it to be just like
Atlanta now,'' Petty said. ``At Atlanta you can hold the Busch car
wide open in the turns, but you can't do that here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little too tight to hold your speed and it comes up on
you quicker than you think. There's also a bump between 1 and 2
that can get you loose, but I have no complaints about the
racetrack. I say everybody should leave it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty feels the same way about the growing controversy over so
many Winston Cup drivers competing in the Busch races, which is
supposed to be a circuit for the up-and-coming drivers in NASCAR.
But more and more big-money Cup stars are driving in BGN races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say bring 'em on and let 'em run,'' Petty said. ``The only
way you learn is from somebody better competing against you. I
think the (Busch) guys that are complaining just need to step up
their game a little.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Busch drivers feel differently about the Cup guys
taking money out of their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaquille O'Neal can't go back to college for the NCAA
Tournament,'' said two-time Busch champion Randy LaJoie. ``Let us
have our series back.''
</P>
<P>
   Lajoie failed to make the top 25 Thursday while nine Cup drivers
earned a spot in the field. Dale Earnhardt Jr., the defending BGN
champion who earned his first Busch victory at Texas last year,
sees both sides of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a double-edged sword,'' said Earnhardt Jr., who will
start on the outside of row 6 Saturday. ``It's pretty obvious they
are taking our points, taking our money and sending guys home that
otherwise would be racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the people who do get to race against guys like Mark
Martin and Jeff Gordon gain so much knowledge. There's no limit to
what these guys can teach you. Without racing against them, I
probably wouldn't be half the race car driver I am today.''
</P>
<P>
   Cup drivers have won three of five Busch events this season.
Seventeen Cup regulars started at Las Vegas earlier this month,
sending home several Busch teams that have full-season
sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   Even Martin, who is the all-time Busch leader with 35 victories
in the series, admits the situation needs to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragedy whenever a (Busch) regular has to go home,''
Martin said. ``But it's something that somebody smarter than me is
going to have to look at and decide what is acceptable.''

HOUSE AND SENATE APPROVE REPUBLICAN BUDGET PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs for updating and revisions throughout to reflect Senate
passage)  (bl) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House and Senate passed the Republican budget
Thursday night, driving toward a big tax cut and a showdown with
the Clinton administration over the nation's priorities in an
emerging era of fiscal plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Both chambers passed the measure on largely party-line votes,
uniting Republicans in the two chambers as they prepare for months
of budget battles with the White House and set an agenda they hope
to carry into the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The vote in the House was 221-208, with 4 Democrats voting in
favor and 2 Republicans voting against. The vote in the Senate was
55-44, with 1 Democrat voting in favor and 1 Republican not voting.
Both chambers also turned aside Democratic budget proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican budget calls for a tax cut of nearly $800 billion
over the next 10 years, an increase in Pentagon spending and more
money for education.
</P>
<P>
   But to remain within strict spending limits that both parties
have vowed to honor, the plan would require deep cuts in most other
programs, prompting sharp criticism from Democrats and leaving even
some Republicans uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   In presenting their competing visions of how to divide the
expected fiscal windfall in coming years, the two parties generally
agreed on setting aside the bulk of projected surpluses for Social
Security, which will come under financial strain as the baby boom
generation retires.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of the enduring sensitivity of Social Security as
a political issue, they battled furiously over whose approach
walled off more money for the system and did more to reduce the
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats attacked Republicans as putting tax cuts ahead of
dealing with the looming problems in Medicare, which will start
running short of money in less than a decade. And Democrats said
the Republican tax cuts would grow so big over the next decade that
they could send the budget back into deficit if the economy
falters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a budget means making choices,'' said House Speaker
Dennis Hastert. The Republican budget, he said, ``makes the right
choices for the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday night, President Clinton called the
Republican plan a series of missed opportunities at a time when the
country is facing the welcome prospect of years of federal budget
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fails to lock in debt reduction, fails to extend the
solvency of Social Security and Medicare, and fails to protect key
investments for the American people, from Head Start to clean water
and law enforcement,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The budget resolution passed Thursday night does not become law
but serves as the blueprint for the tax and spending bills Congress
will take up in the coming months. While it gives the Republicans a
chance to emphasize what they see as their core values _ fiscal
austerity, tax cuts and smaller government _ it leaves until later
in the year the question of how to carry out the spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the appropriations committees that set spending
levels for specific programs say it will be politically difficult
if not impossible to pass spending bills requiring sweeping
cutbacks in the State Department, the environment, the FBI, Head
Start and NASA, among other programs.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication of the bipartisan demand for new spending, the
Senate on Thursday night approved an amendment adding $10 billion
to the budget over 10 years for child care. Earlier, the Senate
rejected a call for additional aid for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican budget does not specify what types of tax cuts
Congress should enact, leaving that decision to the tax-writing
committees in the House and Senate. The budget allows for a tax cut
of $15 billion next year, an amount that would increase rapidly in
subsequent years as the non-Social-Security surplus grows.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leadership has backed off its pledge earlier this
year to cut income tax rates by 10 percent. Instead, Republicans
are now looking at packages that could include some rate
reductions; reductions in the so-called marriage penalty that leads
many two-income couples to pay more in taxes than if they were
single; a cut in inheritance taxes, and a reduction in capital
gains taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who heads the House Ways and Means
Committee, where tax legislation must originate, said he would not
draw up his tax bill until this summer.
</P>
<P>
   There are relatively minor differences in the House and Senate
versions of the budget resolution. Republican aides said they
expected the differences to be worked out quickly when Congress
returns after a two-week recess in April and the final version of
the measure to win quick approval in both chambers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest changes in the budget is a vow to end the
practice of using Social Security surpluses to offset spending or
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would require that all surpluses generated by Social
Security _ $1.8 trillion over the next decade under the assumptions
used by Congress _ be used only to reduce the national debt or to
help pay for an overhaul of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said their plan would do more for Social Security
than Clinton's proposal, which in the first few years would allow
some of the retirement system's money to be used for spending but
would make up for it in later years. Using the Congressional Budget
Office's assumptions about the size of the surplus, the
administration's plan would wall off $1.52 trillion over 10 years
for Social Security, $275 billion less than the Republican plan.
</P>
<P>
   But White House officials argued that their plan set aside more
for Social Security and Medicare combined over the same period.
Using the budget office's assumptions, the administration's plan
would reserve $370 billion for Medicare _ bringing the total for
Social Security and Medicare over 10 years to nearly $1.9 trillion
_ while the Republican plan does not have any money explicitly set
aside for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans in the House who voted against the bill were
Constance Morella of Maryland and Jack Quinn of New York. The
Democrats in the House who voted for the bill were Robert ``Bud''
Cramer of Alabama, Gary Condit of California, Ralph Hall of Texas
and Virgil Goode Jr. of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The only senator to cross party lines was John Breaux, D-La.,
who voted in favor of the Republican plan. Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., did not vote.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused Republicans of shortchanging Medicare to
finance a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a simple choice,'' said Representative Richard A.
Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader in the House. ``They
choose the tax cut over extending the solvency of Social Security
and Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   In a clear sign of how reluctant lawmakers are to be seen as
dipping into Social Security money, the House rejected Clinton's
budget proposal, 426 to 2, because it allowed some of the Social
Security surplus to be spent over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The House also rejected two other alternative budget proposals.
One was backed by the House Democratic leadership and the other by
a group of fiscally conservative Democrats.

MISGUIDED MISSILES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trouble with the missile defense system that Ronald Reagan
proposed, the much derided ``Star Wars,'' was that no defense
system could guard against the tens of thousands of warheads that
the Soviet Union, now Russia, could pour down upon the United
States. But with rogue nations entering the missile age, the
Clinton administration sees some justification in building a
defense that would protect the United States from just one or two
incoming warheads _ a far simpler land- or sea-based system than
the space-based idea of the Reagan era.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is how to square such a system with the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The original thinking behind that
treaty was that an ABM system would provoke the Soviet Union and
the United States into a counterproductive arms race. That was back
in Soviet times. Russia today cannot afford an arms race. But we
still need the Russians to ratify the Start II agreement so they
will begin dismantling their 7,000 intercontinental missiles, which
remain a potential threat to the peace of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the kind of antimissile system that is being proposed
would not be designed to shoot down the huge Russian missile force,
and the United States has explained that to the Russians. Reagan
once proposed that the United States build a ``Star Wars'' system
for the Russians so as not to undermine the rationale behind the
ABM Treaty. But the Russians so far are not buying any of that.
</P>
<P>
   The technology to build an effective antimissile defense is
still far in the future, and it may be that one day the United
States will calculate that such a system is more in our interests
than sticking to the agreement we have with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington should tread carefully along this path. For the
time being the United States is getting more security out of the
ABM Treaty than it would from a defense against the North Koreas,
Irans, or Iraqs of the world, which do not yet have the capability
to attack this continent.

A MICROSOFTENING? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A settlement is exactly how the antitrust court battle between
Microsoft and the US Department of Justice should end.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's steely grip on the operating systems of personal
computers needs to be loosened. And this is the time to act _ while
the case is in recess through mid-April. Otherwise the federal
government could find itself in the troubling position of telling a
private company how to operate. That could weigh the government
down with the complex and potentially damaging work of having to
micromanage Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Some like the idea of slicing Microsoft into small companies _
breaking it up the way the government broke up AT&AMP;T and Standard
Oil. But that is easier said than done. Splitting up Microsoft
might make it less of an industry bully, but it could also damage
the positive traits that have made Microsoft good for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a settlement could offer the best of two worlds: relief
from Microsoft's dominance and a chance for the government to
continue keeping its eye on Microsoft's actions.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only Microsoft's CEO, Bill Gates, has admitted that
settlement talks are occurring. The Justice Department is sticking
with a statement made Monday by Assistant Attorney General Joel
Klein. ``We have not received any settlement proposal from
Microsoft,'' he said, adding that ``if there are to be any
settlement discussions, it is best that they occur directly between
the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Some state attorneys general have called a reported settlement
offer from Microsoft ``minimalist'' and ``inadequate.'' Yet this
unimpressive start is a first step. It signals that a settlement is
possible but will take work. More talks between Microsoft, the
Justice Department, and the suing states are scheduled to take
place on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides might play tough. But they should quickly find their
way to this common ground: Both parties are better off with a
settlement.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ A couple of guys who used to battle it
out on the Texas junior golf circuit have taken different routes to
their current position atop the leader board after one round of The
Players Championship.
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you plotted the courses Bob Estes and Brian Watts followed to
get where they were Thursday, it would look like two trucks
starting off in opposite directions and meeting head on at the
other side of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   But they are together again at 4-under-par 68, the best scores
from the best players in the world on a day when conditions were
ideal for low scores but nobody was able to manhandle the
Tournament Players Course at Sawgrass.
</P>
<P>
   Watts is a Dallas native who attended Oklahoma State, then made
a career out of playing in Japan, where he was one of the kingpins
on the Asian tour.
</P>
<P>
   Estes, meanwhile, grew up in Abilene, honed his game with the
Texas Longhorns and has won more than $4 million on the PGA Tour
since he came to the big time straight out of college.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the same age,'' Watts said of the leading pair. ``We
played lots of junior golf against each other. He went to Texas. I
went to Oklahoma State. And we've taken a little bit different
paths as professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob has been out here since day one and done extremely well.
It took me five-plus years to get going.''
</P>
<P>
   But Watts is making up for lost time in a hurry. He burst onto
the scene last year at the British Open, when his bunker shot from
a half-cocked stance at the 18th hole at Royal Birkdale went in
from 50 feet and got him into a playoff against Mark O'Meara, to
whom he eventually lost.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, it was another 50-foot shot that got Watts' round
going. He started the day like a rank amateur, going 4 over par
after three holes when he triple-bogeyed the par-5 11th, then
bogeyed the 12th. But four birdies in a row ensued, including his
chip-in at the 14th. Before he was done, Watts would birdie eight
of the next 11 holes after his crummy start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 4-over, and then a miracle happened, I guess,'' Watts
said. ``You probably can't print what I said after No. 12. But then
I figured, `What the heck? The worst thing that can happen is I
either shoot in the 80s or I miss the cut.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever, I was still going to live through the day, most
likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shot on 14 was probably the one that got me thinking I
could turn the day around.''
</P>
<P>
   He went from 4-over to 4-under quickly, producing one of the
most exciting scorecards on a day when there were plenty of
noteworthy developments.
</P>
<P>
   If it wasn't Greg Norman recording four 6s on his card,
including a triple bogey at the treacherous island-green par-3
17th, it was Fred Couples hitting his tee shot into the water on
that hole, then teeing it back up and shooting the next ball into
the hole on the fly for a somewhat-less-than-routine par.
</P>
<P>
   If it wasn't Craig Stadler mixing in a triple bogey and a double
bogey but still shooting par-72, it was John Cook making only one
par on the front nine, which he needed 42 strokes to cover.
</P>
<P>
   And proving that mental demons can take up permanent residence,
John Daly started his round with the first of two triple bogeys and
ended up shooting 83. This is two years after Daly trashed his
hotel room at the TPC and entered alcohol rehab after withdrawing
following an all-night bender.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is plenty of trouble out there lurking,'' said Hal
Sutton, who was among three players one stroke behind the leaders
and was referring to the golf course rather than extracurricular
activities. ``The wind gets swirling, and you have to pay attention
to what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the TPC rarely is as exposed as it was Thursday. The
weather was gorgeous. The wind was off and on _ and never more than
a refreshing breeze.
</P>
<P>
   But the greens were similar to bedrock. And the rough has been
grown to U.S. Open proportions. Those traits, plus the fact that
the TPC simply is a difficult course, lifted the average score to
74.5 strokes per player.
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise that the two leaders were among the first
players who hit the course and took advantage of the calm, dewy
conditions in the early-morning hours to get a jump on the rest of
the field. Of the 14 players who shot 70 or better, 10 played in
the morning.
</P>
<P>
   One of those was David Duval, who shot 69 to tie Sutton and Joe
Ozaki in third place.
</P>
<P>
   Duval is coming back after three weeks off but said he played a
lot of golf leading up to The Players. He visited Augusta National
for 36 holes and had at least two days when he played 27 holes each
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I played quite well,'' Duval said of his comeback. ``I
expect a lot of myself, so I'm not going to say I hit it better
than I might have expected after a break. But I'm very pleased
starting out like this.''
</P>
<P>
   As was Watts, who couldn't have seen his remarkable turnaround
coming after the way he started.
</P>
<P>
   He made 8 on the par-5 11th, which was his second hole, without
having any penalty strokes.
</P>
<P>
   But Watts is proof that it's possible to recover from a horrible
start.
</P>
<P>
   Estes, meanwhile, was somewhat more consistent, mixing six
birdies against two bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of tournament where you want to start fast
because you know the course can get a lot tougher as the week goes
along,'' Estes said.
</P>
<P>
   As he was leaving the interview room, Estes bumped into Watts
and said: ``Don't tell them how bad you used to beat me in junior
golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts declined to divulge how past matches between the two went.

RAMBIS: NO MORE ONE-ON-ONE PLAY
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kurt Rambis and four assistant coaches sat in a
circle on the hardwood floor of the Southwest College gym Thursday
afternoon, looking like they would, at any moment, clasp hands and
chant in unison in a desperate attempt to drive away the Lakers'
demons.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it hasn't gotten (begin ital)that(end ital) desperate
yet, but the coaches have begun a program of modest changes to
break the bad mojo that has seen the Lakers go 4-4 over the past
eight games.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, Rambis is proclaiming a near-ban on
one-on-one offense, and he's adding wrinkles to put more movement
in a stagnant half-court game.
</P>
<P>
   Next up could be a shakeup in the starting lineup and the
rotation, possibly the demotion of starting power forward Travis
Knight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still kicking around ideas,'' Rambis said, ``and I'll
come up with a final decision (today).''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the changes will not involve the activation of rookie
guard Tyronn Lue from the injured list. But as for a change at
power forward, where Knight starts almost every game with two quick
fouls, Rambis offered only a long ``maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Rambis has redefined the roles of J.R. Reid and Sean
Rooks _ they'll split time at backup center, depending on the
opponent's lineup. Reid's minutes at power forward will diminish,
opening more playing time for Knight, Dennis Rodman and Robert
Horry.
</P>
<P>
   But only one change is certain: the ban on individual play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want one-on-one. You wanna play one-on-one, go down to
the `Y' (YMCA). That's where they play one-on-one,'' Rambis said.
``I think our team is much better when we do things off of movement
and quick baskets. I think we play right into somebody else's hands
when we play one-on-one.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant is frequently criticized for such play but isn't the
only culprit. ``I was upset with several players for playing
one-on-one,'' Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   So on Thursday, the Lakers spent practice working on
long-forgotten methods for creating open shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movement, that was the theme of today's practice,'' Bryant
said. ``Constantly cutting, spacing, reading each other. . . . I'm
really anxious to see how this movement plays out during the game.
If the movement plays out the way it should play out, we're gonna
have a lot more easy baskets. I'm not just talking about coming off
of screens. . . . I'm talking about guys getting layups off of
backdoor picks.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not necessarily new _ movement was a frequent theme of Del
Harris' _ but coaches hope the renewed emphasis will eliminate some
bad habits.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said he can ``go one-on-one all day,'' but acknowledged,
``if you wanna improve your basketball game you gotta work on
everything, and I'm ready and willing to move without the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis also hopes better offense will provide more scoring
chances for new acquisition Glen Rice. After Wednesday's loss to
Phoenix, Rice seemed upset over his shooting opportunities (he was
5 for 12) but said he didn't ``feel like talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably not getting enough shots based on how we've been
playing our offense,'' Rambis said. ``That's why I wanted to try
and make some changes today in how we ran things, just to clear up
more opportunities for everybody to score.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Shaquille O'Neal's self-described ``stomach
problems'' in Wednesday's game _ which caused him to sit for a long
stretch in the first half _ turned out to be nothing more than
digestive difficulties. He did not aggravate his chronic abdominal
muscle injury.

UNIVERSAL STUDIO'S CITYWALK FEATURES MIX OF NIGHTCLUBS,
RESTAURANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev., N.Y., S.C. Tenn.) (rk) 
 By   BILL DEAN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ In the ever-escalating theme park battles of
Central Florida, CityWalk is Universal Studios' answer to the
popular nighttime entertainment complexes at Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-acre CityWalk opened in February, strategically placed
near the entrance to the Universal Studios theme park. It's
city-like streets lead to nightclubs, restaurants and shops where
surprises wait inside each door.
</P>
<P>
   CityWalk is still growing but already boasts nine restaurants
and nightclubs including a reggae club that is a replica of the
house Bob Marley called home in Kingston, Jamaica. Marley looks
down from photos on a living room wall as reggae sways listeners
like the palm fronds overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street is Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville, where parrot
heads cheer as a 6-foot volcano spews margarita mix into an
oversized blender.
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner, CityJazz doubles as Downbeat magazine's Jazz
Hall of Fame. It is a shrine where an original American art form
comes to life with saxes on stage and the wide-eyed images of Duke
Ellington and Miles Davis on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Joni Davis, who lives in Jacksonville, wasn't a reggae fan
before she and her husband walked into Bob Marley _ A Tribute to
Freedom. But as the music's live vibe poured forth from an open-air
courtyard stage, they decided it was worth exploring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of new to me, but I like it,'' said Davis, 34. ``And
I love this atmosphere: the music and the beat.''
</P>
<P>
   About a city block away, Debi Jester of Winter Park and a friend
munched conch fritters inside Margaritaville while dozens of others
crowded around the Volcano Bar and awaited its frozen concoction
eruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the island look to it,'' Jester said.
</P>
<P>
   CityWalk's design was no accident. Universal built the complex
at a junction where visitors _ including those heading to Universal
Studios and the under-construction Islands of Adventure theme park
_ pass through on their way from huge parking garages.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the parking garage via moving sidewalks, they
enter CityWalk through a walkway depositing them in the heart of
the complex, overlooking a plaza and lagoon complete with floating
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Those leaving the theme parks, on the other hand, will find an
Emerald City-like beacon of fun glowing ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point was to put the entire place on display to face the
people coming out of the two parks,'' says Gentry Akens, CityWalk's
director of venue design. ``So you will see this majestic,
neon-glowing thing coming out and you will want to investigate.''
</P>
<P>
   CityWalk restaurants include chains such as NASCAR Cafe, which
joins locations in Nashville, Tenn., and Myrtle Beach, S.C., and
Emeril's, the second eatery opened by chef and restaurant owner
Emeril Lagasse.
</P>
<P>
   Due to open soon are a Motown Cafe, where a 28-foot replica of
the Jackson Five's single ``ABC'' spins overhead as performers
emulate The Temptations and the Supremes on stage. The restaurant
is bigger than existing locations in Las Vegas and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to open in late April is a Latin Quarter, where
south-of-the-border music vies for attention with plantains, flan
and other delicacies.
</P>
<P>
   Also planned is a complex of 21 movie theaters, 13 specialty
shops and, across a lagoon, an NBA restaurant next to the already
open Hard Rock Cafe _ where acts such as Natalie Merchant, Ringo
Starr and B.B. King are slated to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Universal officials believe the number of CityWalk's nightclubs
compares favorably to Downtown Disney's West Side, which offers
such restaurants as Wolfgang Puck's Cafe and Bongos Cuban Cafe,
which is co-owned by Gloria Estefan.
</P>
<P>
   While Disney World's Pleasure Island charges an $18.95 admission
to enjoy all of its clubs, CityWalk is free to enter. At night,
however, CityWalk clubs charge covers that range from $3 to $9.

UAL'S PRESIDENT WINS TOP JOB  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Completing a suddenly meteoric rise after 32 years at United
Airlines, James E. Goodwin was appointed chairman and chief
executive Thursday of the UAL Corp., United's parent. He will take
over in July, succeeding Gerald Greenwald, who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by UAL's board ended a closely watched five-month
search that had narrowed the choice to Goodwin, who was named UAL's
president in September, and Louis R. Hughes, a top executive at the
General Motors Corp.. Goodwin appears to have had the edge because
he was an insider and had cultivated strong relations with United's
unions.
</P>
<P>
   Management and employees own 55 percent of UAL, making it the
largest employee-owned company in the world. The company said that
Goodwin, 54, was the unanimous choice of the six-member executive
committee, which includes Greenwald and representatives of the Air
Line Pilots Association and the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers, United's two largest unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's truly fitting in an employee-owned company that the CEO
come from within our own ranks,'' said Michael H. Glawe, the head
of the pilots union and a board member.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the search who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said that Goodwin emerged as a top candidate late in the
process, making his ascension all the more remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Goodwin was a senior vice president, in charge of
North America, when he was named president in September. He
succeeded John A. Edwardson, Greenwald's hand-picked heir apparent,
who was forced out after losing a vote of confidence from the
pilots and machinists. Though Goodwin was named to UAL's board, the
company made clear that he was not necessarily a candidate to
succeed Greenwald.
</P>
<P>
   But in time his star rose. Some experts watching the
developments said the prospect of running a worker-owned company
had made it difficult for UAL to attract strong candidates. But
Greenwald said in a statement Thursday that the search committee
saw many exceptional prospects. Then he added: ``As we proceeded,
it became clear to us that Jim was the template against which we
were measuring everyone else. He emerged as the gold standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, 50, headed GM's international operations until last fall
when he was sidelined in a reorganization. He is now executive vice
president in charge of new business strategies. In addition to his
management experience _ Greenwald also came for the auto industry _
he was seen as an attractive candidate because of the time he had
spent at European companies where unions sat on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin, in his three decades at United, has worked in nearly
every part of the airline, including finance, maintenance,
marketing, airport operations and reservations. A tall bear of a
man with a friendly mien, Goodwin had a few glitches, such as being
less accustomed to the public speaking required of a corporate
president. United executives and Wall Street analysts say that he
has improved markedly since last fall.
</P>
<P>
   But the main attribute that appeared to win him the top job was
the strong ties he developed with the unions. ``Since he has been
president, we've found him to be accessible, responsive to employee
concerns and aboveboard in his dealings with us,'' said Ken Thiede,
the president of United's machinists union local.
</P>
<P>
   Such a reserve of goodwill may well come in handy, as Goodwin
will take over at a critical time for United. He will have to
negotiate new contracts with both the pilots and the machinists and
decide whether to renew the employee stock ownership program that
expires next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main challenges I see ahead,'' he said in a statement
Thursday ``are meeting the needs of an increasingly sophisticated
customer on a global basis and building upon the strides we have
made already to improve the relationship among management, unions
and all employees.''

SHORT REVIEWS ON THE SILVER SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: The word (star) should be replaced by the symbol)  
 (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. (Star) denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings
and running times are in parentheses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now Playing
</P>
<P>
   (Star)  &UR; ` &LR; `AFFLICTION,'' starring Nick Nolte, James Coburn
(winner of the Oscar for best-supporting actor), Willem Dafoe,
Sissy Spacek and Mary Beth Hurt. Directed by Paul Schrader (R, 114
minutes). Nolte is devastating in the performance of his career, as
Wade Whitehouse, a New Hampshire loner fighting a losing battle
with demons from his past. Foremost among them: Coburn,
terrifyingly authentic as the drunken, abusive father who long ago
cowed his sons into submission.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Schrader, this pure, unfettered adaptation of
Russell Banks' novel starts on a deceptively ordinary note, then
escalates into inexorable fury. Every little detail matters. Ms.
Spacek and Ms. Hurt expertly play the women who trigger Wade's
crisis (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``ANALYZE THIS,'' starring Robert De Niro and Billy
Crystal. Directed by Harold Ramis (R, 110 minutes). The title,
concept and teaming of these co-stars are all funny before the
lights go down, so think of this comedy as an offer you can't
refuse. Cast as a mobster whose confidence is shaken, De Niro is
hilarious simply by playing his role halfway straight, in classic
goodfella style.
</P>
<P>
   His mobster finds just the right comic foil in Billy Crystal, as
the psychiatrist who utters the immortal: ``When I got into family
therapy, this wasn't the family I had in mind.'' There's a lot more
where that came from in this breezy comic treat (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``BABY GENIUSES,'' starring Kathleen Turner, Christopher Lloyd
and many toddlers. Directed by Bob Clark (PG, 94 minutes). One way
to get through this guaranteed 100 percent laugh-free comedy is to
wonder whether it really is the worst film you've even seen.
Probably not, but it's pretty darn close. Woefully substandard
production values give it a ghastly look, made all the worse by the
grotesque computer morphing of young children into adult-style wise
guys. The plotting is shrill, bordering on incomprehensible. Ms.
Turner lurches through the film with a performance that just says,
``Hey, it's a living'' (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``CENTRAL STATION,'' starring Fernanda Montenegro,
Vinicius de Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles
(R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless
older woman crosses paths with an orphaned boy. There's plenty of
room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Salles' film is all
in the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then
embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's
hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Salles brings great
tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey.
Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one of last year's
very best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE CORRUPTOR,'' starring Chow Yun-Fat and Mark Wahlberg.
Directed by James Foley (R, 111 minutes). A conventional but
above-average police drama set in Chinatown in New York City, ``The
Corruptor'' finds the rookie cop Danny Wallace (Wahlberg) learning
the ropes from his rule-bending partner, Nick Chen ( Chow), who has
gotten dangerously chummy with Chinatown's mob bosses. The
atmosphere is gritty, the action sequences sleek and the questions
the story raises about loyalty, ethics, friendship and betrayal,
although familiar, are still worth bringing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Corruptor'' is a more effective showcase for the brooding
charisma of Chow, a Hong Kong action superstar, than ``The
Replacement Killers,'' his English-language debut (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN,'' starring Michelle
Pfeiffer, Treat Williams, Whoopi Goldberg and Jonathan Jackson.
Directed by Ulu Grosbard (PG-13, 108 minutes). Ms. Pfeiffer gives a
fine, affecting performance in this adaptation of Jacquelyn
Mitchard's best seller. And Grosbard carefully delineates its story
of a child's disappearance and its aftermath, showing the ways that
such a catastrophe affects his family. Restrained and
unsentimental, this astute drama deals thoughtfully with the chasm
between real and idealized family lives (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``EIGHT MILLIMETER,'' starring Nicolas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix,
James Gandolfini, Myra Carter and Catherine Keener. Directed by
Joel Schumacher (R, 120 minutes). This thriller delves into the
perverse underworld of the pornography business, shocking audiences
with the realization that sex and violence can be so dull. Cage,
seriously miscast, plays a private detective and devoted family man
who is suddenly, to his horror, drawn into the realm of porn.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, this is where the film wanted to be even when its
opening scenes were stuck in suburban Pennsylvania. But the story's
parade of New York and Hollywood sleazeballs fails to deliver
either engaging drama or heartfelt kinks. Phoenix is
scene-stealingly good in a sidekick's role (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``ELIZABETH,'' the Oscar winner for best makeup. Starring Cate
Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush and Christopher Eccleston.
Directed by Shekhar Kapur (R, 124 minutes). In this lurid costume
drama depicting Elizabeth I as a royal rookie, the impressive Ms.
Blanchett plays the Queen as if her principal responsibilities were
being bejeweled, selecting consorts and saying ``Leave us!'' with a
wave of the hand.
</P>
<P>
   For all its putative concern with Roman Catholic-Protestant
strife at the start of Elizabeth's reign, this is historical drama
for those whose idea of history is back issues of Vogue. Intent on
spectacle, complete with burning at the stake and one dance scene
reminiscent of ``Saturday Night Fever,'' it winds up imagining the
queen as a glamorously stressed-out modern woman afflicted by a
super-intense case of having it all (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``FORCES OF NATURE,'' starring Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck.
Directed by Bronwen Hughes (PG-13, 102 minutes). Does Ms. Bullock's
loopy girl-next-door charm really make audiences want to follow her
anywhere? If so, they'd better be prepared for an amusement park
ride with senior citizens, a long romp through K-mart and the other
equally desperate settings for a road movie that otherwise has
nowhere to go.
</P>
<P>
   A would-be screwball romantic comedy about a man thrown together
with a zany drifter en route to his own wedding, it shows off Ms.
Bullock to amusing if overly frenetic advantage. Affleck fares less
well with the film's wimpier role. Some of the material's many gaps
are filled by special-effects hail and windstorms, which are as
close as the title comes to making any sense (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL'' (winner of the best-foreign-film
Oscar), directed by and starring Roberto Benigni (named best actor)
(PG-13, 122 minutes). Italy's most antic funnyman dares to find
humor and tenderness in the midst of the Holocaust, and his risk
pays off. This Cannes prize winner is as stubbornly entertaining as
its central character, a Jewish waiter named Guido who jokes his
way through the nightmare for the sake of his loved ones. Daring
also to combine an opening hour of romance and pranks with a more
somber second act, Benigni avoids all traces of the maudlin and
effectively creates a situation in which comedy is courage. In this
unpretentious, enormously likable film, he shines as a father whose
fibs and hilarious buffoonery know no bounds, and no fear (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS,'' starring Jason
Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Sting, Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones and
Nick Moran. Directed by Guy Ritchie (R, 106 minutes). Not since
``The Usual Suspects'' has there been such an oversupply of cool
macho schemers in a single film. And they're served up with a
quick, tart economy that bespeaks the filmmaker's background making
videos and commercials _ actually an advantage, for a change.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much beneath the surface here; what's most
entertaining is Ritchie's droll, hard-boiled storytelling and the
rogue's gallery of a cast that he has assembled. All the film need
do is juggle assorted miscreants and four separate gangs who,
figuratively speaking, can't shoot straight (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``PAYBACK,'' starring Mel Gibson, James Coburn and Gregg Henry.
Directed by Brian Helgeland (R, 110 minutes). In this inept,
excessively sadistic film-noir spoof adapted from the same Richard
Stark novel (``The Hunter'') that inspired the 1967 genre classic
``Point Blank,'' Gibson is a thief named Porter who retaliates with
a vengeance after an attempt on his life.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to recover $70,000 that was stolen from him by a
double-crossing partner in crime, he works his way up the pecking
order of a crime syndicate, brutally dispatching all who stand in
his way. The hard-boiled dialogue is ludicrous, the storytelling
clunky, the acting fair to awful, the gore ankle deep. Credit the
star with being able to keep a straight face through this loathsome
mess (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``SAVING PRIVATE RYAN,'' Oscar winner for best
cinematography, best editing, best sound and best sound-effects
editing. Starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore, Jeremy
Davies, Edward Burns and Adam Goldberg. Directed by Steven
Spielberg (winner of the best-director Oscar) (R, 168 minutes).
Spielberg's soberly magnificent new film is the finest war movie of
our time. Turning back the clock to restore passion and meaning to
the genre, he works in a spirit of urgent communication to look at
war as if it has not been looked at before.
</P>
<P>
   Tour-de-force battle scenes are frank without sensationalism,
and the same great storyteller who made you believe there was an
extraterrestrial hiding in the closet has made this an irresistibly
vibrant, gripping tale. Hanks continues to astonish with admirable
modesty, and the rest of the casting is comparably inspired. As he
did with ``Schindler's List,'' Spielberg has made a landmark film
of devastating power (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE'' (the Oscar winner for best film,
best original screenplay, best art direction, best costumes and
best comedy score.) Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow (the
best-actress winner), Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench
(best supporting actress). Directed by John Madden (R, 113
minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an
exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film
unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and
turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his
``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,'' dares to imagine
whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic
passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty.
Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an
Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving
we enjoy today and has great fun presenting the creation of ``Romeo
and Juliet,'' glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a
fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully
realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``TANGO,'' starring Miguel Angel Sola. Written and
directed by Carlos Saura. Cinematography by Vittorio Storaro
(PG-13, 100 minutes). A thrilling display of tango heat and
virtuosity. And it's no slight to the actors who play lovers to say
that the dancing here is steamier than any kiss. In his most
electrifying dance film, Saura offers transfixingly beautiful
glimpses of the dance and the great range of emotions it can
conjure. Storaro's dazzlingly fluid cinematography captures all the
nuances this material demands. Everyone in the film is utterly
consumed by tango fever; audiences will be, too (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE THIN RED LINE,'' starring Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, Nick
Nolte, Sean Penn and Woody Harrelson. Directed by Terrence Malick
(R, 166 minutes). From the first frame of this huge, drifting war
epic loosely derived from James Jones' Guadalcanal novel, it's
viscerally clear that Malick is back. The exquisite, oddly detached
visual style that made ``Badlands'' and ``Days of Heaven'' the most
beautiful films of the 1970s is instantly apparent here, even if
the narrative vagueness and brooding voice-overs are also familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The film sprawls, gets lost and occasionally delivers visual
poetry, the kind that could have been greatly helped by tighter
editing. Bottom line: No one who admired Malick's early work should
miss this. But those expecting anything simple will not find it
here (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``TRUE CRIME,'' starring Clint Eastwood, Isaiah
Washington, James Woods and Lisa Gay Hamilton. Directed by Clint
Eastwood (R, 127 minutes). In his most quietly poignant film since
``A Perfect World,'' Eastwood directs a death row thriller with
redemption on its mind. Beginning almost casually, and taking on
growing urgency as it moves toward an imaginatively suspenseful
ending, it tells of a jaded newspaper reporter who, to his own
surprise as much as anyone else's, finds himself fighting at the
11th hour to save a possibly innocent man from execution. Eastwood
is older than the man he plays, but not too old to be plausible as
the father of an adorable little girl in the cast; she happens to
be his real daughter (Maslin).

<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The lessons of the old school are not so
easily dismissed. Leon Barmore never looked at the sport of women's
basketball as the land of opportunity, and for most of his two
decades-plus at Louisiana Tech, there was never a reason to.
</P>
<P>
   Barmore's career path had carried few, if any, to fame, or
wealth. He had a good job in his hometown, where he graduated from
high school, and went to college, and met his wife, and raised his
daughter, who went to the same high school and college as him.
</P>
<P>
   He was flattered when a team from David Stern's new professional
league called, tormented even, because the offer in Houston wasn't
that far from Ruston, La., his rural sanctuary of ``churches and
parking meters.'' The chance to coach in the Women's National
Basketball Association represented exciting new challenge, live and
in color on national television.
</P>
<P>
   Barmore remained in Ruston, with a recruiting class he believed
in and a sense of duty to a slumping program, at least by the
standards of where it had been. He let the pro job go, and another
veteran male women's college coach _ Van Chancellor of Mississippi
_ wound up with Cynthia Cooper, Sheryl Swoopes, a couple of titles
and all the trimmings.
</P>
<P>
   Barmore has been rewarded for his loyalty and faith, traveling
two more roads to the Final Four, but apparently not without a few
wistful moments. He couldn't stop himself from wondering about that
other road at the fork.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one opportunity and I may never _ you know, I'm not
going into that,'' Barmore said, with a heavy sigh. ``I wish I
could have done both. You can't do both.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not so much about right or wrong, as it is about what he
knows, how he was raised.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Peck, running in a younger, can-do crowd, made no such
rationalizations last July when the telephone rang and the people
from the WNBA startup franchise in Orlando asked her to come for
the following summer.
</P>
<P>
   One year after assuming her first head coaching post at Purdue,
she said, of course, she would love to.
</P>
<P>
   If Barmore reflects the sport's organic past, Peck is about its
intriguing future. Their worlds collide when Louisiana Tech meets
Peck and No. 1 Purdue tonight in one of the national semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, Peck will leave Purdue behind when the
weekend is over. She will take the leap, the first big-time college
coach to do so, not worried about risk.
</P>
<P>
   Barmore, for his part, didn't have the benefit of knowing the
W.N.B.A. would work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it might get the crowds in five or 10 years,'' he
said. He let the train leave without him, a new-school lesson Peck
obviously learned.
</P>
<P>
   For people like her, women's basketball is an upwardly mobile
world of opening doors and potential rewards. She is 32, 6 feet 4
inches tall, a smart, composed woman who played the modern game at
Vanderbilt and coaches it with a Tennessee twang and a radiant
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Purdue, she had already been an assistant at
Tennessee and Kentucky, after playing professionally in Japan. In
1997, she took over a team in turmoil, steered it into the Elite 8,
and now the Final Four. She has a become a commodity, like the
young Rick Pitino, brushing off her departure with a politician's
elan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking about what's going to happen,'' she said. ``We
are focusing on what's happening right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Barmore said he wished he didn't have to coach against Peck,
whom he admires, though the proud veteran in him added, ``I don't
think anybody will out-coach me.'' The train may have left him
behind, but not the game.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime practitioner of the half-court offense, he now
``bites his lip, sits down and watches a track meet.'' He loves the
sport. He just wishes he had more time to enjoy what it is going to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next 10, 20 years, it will be unbelievable,'' he said. ``I
wish I could roll back the clock and be 30 again.''
</P>
<P>
   Barmore won a national title in 1988, developed his share of
Olympians and pros. When the inaugural WNBA season began without
him, he swelled with pride watching Teresa Weatherspoon and Vicki
Johnson from little Louisiana Tech play their opener in Los
Angeles, in Magic Johnson's house.
</P>
<P>
   That's one version of progress, of moving on. His daughter is
getting married on April 10th, and that is another. By then,
Carolyn Peck will be off to Orlando, preparing for the summer pro
season. Leon Barmore said he's happy for her. He looks forward to
watching on TV. &QL;

EBAY TO PAY $75 MILLION FOR SPOTS ON SEVERAL AMERICA ONLINE SITES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ In one of the largest partnership deals in
the short history of the World Wide Web, the online auction site
Ebay announced Thursday that it would pay $75 million for prominent
placement on several services owned by America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The four-year deal establishes Ebay as the official auction site
on America Online's proprietary service and its other online
properties, including AOL.com, Compuserve, the chat service ICQ and
the company's newest acquisition, Netscape Communications Corp.'s
Netcenter Web portal.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first such deal to encompass all of America Online's
services. The company's proprietary service alone has 16 million
members. ``This will bring us an enormous number of new users,''
said Steven P. Westly, Ebay's vice president for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   But the real estate is not cheap. The deal is the third largest
for America Online, behind a $150 million, five-year deal with
Tele-Save, a long-distance company, and a five-year $300 million
deal with the credit card company First USA.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Ebay deal will see less cash changing hands, it is
not exclusive. The deals with Tele-Save and First USA are. Four
other auction sites _ Bid.com, Onsale, First Auction and Ubid _
will continue to be able to buy advertising on America Online, said
Wendy Goldberg, a spokeswoman for America Online, which is based in
Dulles, Va.
</P>
<P>
   But Ebay will be the only company marketed as America Online's
auction partner, with its services integrated into content areas.
For example, Ebay will have its own site within America Online, but
with the same auctions that are available on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ``continues to confirm that AOL's real estate is
prime,'' said Marc Johnson, a senior analyst at Jupiter
Communications, a New York research company. He called the deal
``very substantial, even in Internet dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal also highlights Ebay's rapid rise to prominence. The
company went public in September at $18 a share. It closed Thursday
at $159.375, but the stock has already undergone a 3-for-1 split,
making each original share worth $478.125.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been a smooth ride, however. Earlier this year, Ebay
was unable to keep up with traffic to its site, and several
government agencies have initiated investigations of other issues,
including allegations that the site was used to deal in fake sports
memorabilia.

ROBINSON TURNS UP THE HEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Kings coach Larry Robinson gave a strongly
worded speech to his players at Thursday morning's practice before
the evening's game against the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson told the players that some of their careers _ at least
their careers with the Kings _ would be at stake over the next
three-plus weeks as the team tries to battle its way into playoff
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out of this,'' Robinson said later. ``And I don't
care if we're 15 points behind. To me, the (measure) of a man is
when he fights right to the death. I don't give a damn if we're
two, five or 16 points behind. I want to see guys give their all
until the last buzzer goes on the 18th of April. Don't look at the
standings, don't look at anything else. Just give it your all.
That's all you can ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he'd been concerned about his team's level of
concentration at the end of a week in which the Steve Duchesne
issue was resolved, center Yanic Perreault was dealt to Toronto and
the trading deadline passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot went on the last two or three days,'' Robinson said.
``When you're not among the elite teams in the league, everybody
feels, `Gee, am I going?' It's always an uneasy feeling. Everybody
handles it differently. My job is to get these guys ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said the crispness that marked recent practices was
missing the past couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just saw that the concentration level wasn't there,'' he
said. ``Preparation doesn't start when you walk in at 4:30 or 5 at
night (before a game). The last couple of days, the high tempo that
had been there wasn't there. Yes, I understand a couple of friends
moved on. Buy you've got to look after yourself. That's what the
games are all about _ preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   Babych arrives: The newest King was not in the lineup Thursday
night, but he said he's ready to contribute when he gets the
chance, an opportunity that may come Sunday in Colorado when the
Kings begin a five-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Babych arrived in town Wednesday, and practiced with his
new team for the first time Thursday morning. Drafted in 1980 and
approaching his 38th birthday, Babych said he's planning to play
next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing for sure,'' said Babych, acquired Tuesday in the
trade that sent Steve Duchesne to Philadelphia. ``I'm not ready to
stop. I've got no doubt about it. I feel too good to stop. I think
I'd be cheating myself if I didn't want to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Babych's contract expires after the season, but he said he'd
like to remain with the Kings next season. He also said he believes
he can help the team immediately, if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got seven defensemen here,'' he said. ``They know they
can count on me to step in and not hurt the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Bodger, Robinson said: ``I think he's very similar to Dougie
Bodger, a real smart player, a big strong kid who can move the
puck. He played on the power play in Philadelphia. He's a cagey
veteran, is what he is.''

EDITORIAL: MORE 737 HOMEWORK FOR BOEING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, March 26:
</P>
<P>
   Despite significant modifications made after the 1994 crash of a
Boeing 737 jetliner near Pittsburgh, the National Transportation
Safety Board has rightly decided to withhold its approval from the
current design of 737 rudders. In a unanimous decision, the federal
safety panel found that the design ``is not reliably redundant'' _
meaning, essentially, that it does not have sufficient capacity to
compensate for its own failure.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB's findings reflected more than its analysis of that and
another 737 disaster in 1991 that together took 157 lives. They
also underscored the board's determination to push the aviation
industry to learn everything it can about the admittedly murky
world of rudder malfunctions on the very aircraft that is the
workhorse of domestic aviation. In February, for example, a Boeing
737 operated by Metrojet made an emergency landing in Baltimore
because of a rudder problem. But the precise nature of that problem
remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration says it does not know what
the NTSB means by a ``reliably redundant'' rudder design. As the
regulator of airlines and aircraft manufacturers, the FAA often
sounds defensive whenever the board issues a major safety
recommendation. In addition, the FAA has in fact approved several
changes that should eliminate rudder reversal, in which the rudder
moves in a direction contrary to the pilot's command. Rudder
reversal has been cited as the probable cause of 1994 crash as well
as one in Colorado Sprimgs in 1991 that took 25 lives. But the NTSB
is urging the FAA and Boeing to examine the entire universe of
potential rudder problems, including the mysterious malfunction
that afflicted the Metrojet flight.
</P>
<P>
   Redundancy is one of the primary tenets of aviation design. If
one engine fails, the other engine or engines allow the craft to
operate safely. Every system needs a reliable backup. For that
reason, the NTSB has wisely called upon the FAA to convene an
engineering and evaluation board composed of experts from
government, industry and academia to examine other possible sources
of rudder malfunction. The study is to be completed by March 31 of
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing considers its system reliable and notes that the problem
of rudder reversal has occurred rarely in 77 million flights. That
is certainly true. But the standard should be as high as possible
for the 737, an aircraft that, as Boeing likes to crow, flies 1
million people a day and takes off every six seconds somewhere in
the world.

EDITORIAL: AN OPPORTUNITY ON CIVIL RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, March 26:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is renewing the fight to get Bill Lann Lee
confirmed as assistant attorney general for civil rights, a
position Lee has filled admirably on an acting basis for nearly two
years _ since Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee first
blocked his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican response so far is perplexing. No hearings have
been scheduled, and the word on Capitol Hill is that Sen. Orrin
Hatch, the Judiciary Committee's chairman, plans to quietly kill
the nomination by ignoring it, much as he did last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the circumstances now are quite different. For one thing,
Lee's record in the post only shows how wrong Hatch and others were
two years ago when they tried to depict his conciliatory approach
to civil rights enforcement as somehow out of the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Lee's nomination has returned to the Senate at a
moment when Republicans have a pressing need to distance themselves
from the bigotry of the Council of Conservative Citizens, a white
supremacist group that has cultivated ties with Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott and Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia. The party's image
was hardly helped this week when the House voted down a
disingenuous GOP resolution that condemned racism but intentionally
avoided any mention of the extreme group.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch and his colleagues should wake up and see Lee's nomination
as a political opportunity. By promptly scheduling confirmation
hearings and allowing an up-or-down vote by the full Senate,
Republicans can begin to reassure the nation about their commitment
to racial fairness and civil rights. A party truly aspiring to be
seen as inclusive would not pass up this chance.

 McMILLAN'S IMPACT STRETCHES THE IMAGINATION  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In his 12-year playing history, the guy has a
club-record 4,893 assists, yet the most important one belongs to
his brother, Randy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never flown alone, I'd never flown that far, I'd never
lived alone,'' Nate McMillan said of his first plane ride to
Seattle in the summer of 1986. ``I cried so much the night before
my flight, I almost didn't get on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, Randy got me on the plane, or I might never have
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the brotherly boot to the backside, Seattle would have
been denied the most earnest, selfless warrior in the city's
relatively brief time as a pro sports joint.
</P>
<P>
   Nate McMillan might be the first athlete whose jersey was
retired primarily because he was a good teammate and a better
person. That says a lot about the state of sports.
</P>
<P>
   It also says something about this place, rewarding someone whose
celebrity profile didn't much exceed the Aurora Avenue tunnel. For
a country son of the Carolinas, McMillan turned out to be as
Seattle as damp floor mats.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like McMillan, you don't enjoy summer, the feel of
300-yard tee shots and the smell of a new baseball glove. As with
all of those things, McMillan can't be quantified, so
numbers-obsessed sports fans won't understand the fuss.
</P>
<P>
   In a league where the garish is falsely feted, McMillan was a
subtlety, an acquired taste favored by connoisseurs. But before we
get too carried away in silly wine-critic analogies, here's a more
substantial measurement of his impact:
</P>
<P>
   McMillan was a key factor in taking the Sonics to two unexpected
appearances in Western Conference title series (1987 and 1993). But
after helping them gain an expected Western title in 1996, his
injury absence for the first half of the Finals against the Bulls
is seen by some as what kept the Sonics from rocking the basketball
world.
</P>
<P>
   Fanciful? Maybe. Such indulgences are acceptable upon ceremonies
such as Wednesday's jersey retirement. The Sonics haven't done one
of those in a couple of decades, so imaginations deserve to be
exercised.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a back ailment sustained a couple series earlier,
when the Sonics reached one of the franchise's all-time highs in a
4-0 sweep of the defending NBA champion Houston Rockets, McMillan
struggled through seven games against Utah. Then he sat out the
first half of the Bulls' series, which not coincidentally went 0-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't know how the injury happened, but I was about
one doctor away from having surgery,'' he said of the disk problem
that sent pain down his legs. ``If I could have given Gary (Payton)
duties away from the ball, we could have done something.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics, with McMillan, rallied to win a pair at home and
force the Bulls to a sixth game in Chicago before losing.
</P>
<P>
   In the six Bulls' championships with Michael Jordan, no Western
team pushed the Bulls to a seventh game. As well as the Utah Jazz
played the Bulls in the subsequent two Finals, there are hoopheads
who think a healthy '96 Seattle team, with Shawn Kemp at his
unstoppable peak, a more rested Payton and 20 minutes of McMillan
defense on Jordan, would have been best equipped to flirt with
hoops immortality.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan's self-effacing nature won't let him accept the
flattery. Which doesn't mean he can't enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother always comes up with these sayings; I don't know
where she gets them,'' he said. ``She said, `God put me down (with
injury) to show how much I meant to the team.' I don't know how
true it was, but it made me feel better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a part of the Finals was the best thing about my career.
I'd never been involved in a championship before, at any level.
I'll never forget that atmosphere. So (sitting out the first three
games) was the toughest basketball thing I've ever gone through.''
</P>
<P>
   In a scene filled by Jordan, Dennis Rodman, Scottie Pippen and
the George Karl quote machine, the absence of McMillan was little
noted nor long remembered _ symbolic for a career that flourished
at the back of the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Because of chronic injuries, his last two seasons amounted to 37
and 18 games, so it was easy to lose sight of the fact that at his
peak, McMillan's defense, sense of the game, and sacrifice were
exquisite complementary skills that are rarely drafted, never
rewarded financially and always sought desperately by coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Wednesday, there was a little public recognition for
those less celebrated virtues. Acknowledgment of someone who gave
on the court and in the community was the best thing the Sonics
have accomplished this season _ until McMillan is activated off the
coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Those unfamiliar with Sonic basketball will question how
McMillan's jersey rates hanging with championship-makers Lenny
Wilkens, Jack Sikma and Fred Brown.
</P>
<P>
   You hadda be here.
</P>
<P>
   You hadda be from here.
</P>
<P>
   Winners often are made of more than the sum of their W's.

VETERAN ASSISTANT GRAHAM TO COACH WSU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Vowing to turn around a program that has suffered
through three straight losing seasons, Paul Graham, an assistant
coach the past seven years at Oklahoma State, was hired Thursday as
the new head basketball coach at Washington State University.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who has spent nearly 17 years as a college assistant,
was named as the replacement to Kevin Eastman, who resigned at the
end of the season after the Cougars fell to 10-19.
</P>
<P>
   WSU athletic director Rick Dickson said he felt honored to name
Graham, 48, to his first head-coaching position.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a person who has prepared all his life to have this
type of opportunity,'' Dickson said. ``What he really needed was an
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham also was an assistant at New Mexico (1991-92) and SMU
(1982-88).
</P>
<P>
   Graham's five-year contract at WSU will pay him a yearly base
salary of $125,000 plus incentives.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that he has had the opportunity to work under one of
the nation's best head coaches, Oklahoma State's Eddie Sutton, who
has produced 13 other head coaches from the ranks of his
assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like playing in March,'' Graham said in reference to his
goal of taking WSU to the postseason. ``A few years ago, I had the
opportunity to sit next to Eddie Sutton at the Final Four (in
Seattle) and it was really exciting. ... I've been spoiled in my
career going to the NCAA tournament. I kind of like that and I
don't like losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham also is known for helping to produce several quality NBA
players, most notably Bryant ``Big Country'' Reeves at Oklahoma
State, Luc Longley at New Mexico and Jon Koncak at SMU.
</P>
<P>
   Graham wasn't making any predictions about a quick turnaround
for the WSU program, which finished last in the Pac-10 (4-14).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready for this challenge, and it is a challenge,'' he
said, comparing the task ahead to a new marriage. ``... Everyone
has told me when they talk about Washington State how tough the job
is. People told me marriage was tough and now I'm deeply in debt
and have two children at home. But I've succeeded as a husband and
I've succeeded as a father, and now I want to take that same
passion ... and succeed as a basketball coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham is a 1974 graduate of the University of North Texas. His
son, Nicholas, is 18 and will likely play for his father at
Washington State, Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from a program like Oklahoma State that also is located
in a small community (Stillwater), Graham believes that WSU needs
to use its remoteness as an advantage by building an exciting
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this to be the toughest place to play in this league,
and we have to make it that way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson said he has known of Graham for several years and first
became acquainted with him while Dickson was athletic director at
Tulsa in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since that time, I have heard over and over again how highly
regarded he is throughout the coaching fraternity around the
country,'' Dickson said.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates for the post included Oregon assistant Don
Newman, Kentucky assistant George Felton, Utah assistant Donny
Daniels, UCLA assistant Jim Saia and Cal State-Northridge head
coach Bobby Braswell.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga coach Dan Monson discussed the vacancy with Dickson
before taking his name out of consideration.
</P>
<P>
   While Dickson said he considered the other candidates, Graham
quickly emerged as the leading contender for the job last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that struck me very clearly was his passion
for what he believes can be done at Washington State University and
his passion to teach and develop young men, not only in the sport
of basketball but with their lives as well,'' Dickson said.

DEVILS TOPPLE PENGUINS, 5-3, TIGHTENING THEIR GRIP ON FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Although Jaromir Jagr was having a quiet
game, the Pittsburgh Penguins were having their way with the New
Jersey Devils. Pittsburgh was leading by 3-2 at the start of the
third period Thursday night, in a game that would decide the
Atlantic Division leader.
</P>
<P>
   But the Devils found another gear in the third period and found
the energy that had been lacking throughout a sluggish second
period. Playing perhaps their most complete 20 minutes of the
season, firing 17 shots at the Penguins' net, the Devils came back
on goals by Brad Bombardir, Petr Sykora, on the power play, and
Patrik Elias, into an empty net, to defeat the Penguins, 5-3, at
Continental Arena before 15,204 fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat on our lead,'' Penguins coach Kevin Constantine said.
``We felt we could sit in our end and protect it and not play
hockey. When you quit playing, you allow the other team too many
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the Devils' seventh in 10 games and provided
them with a 3-point cushion in their division and moved them to
within 2 points of the Ottawa Senators in the battle for first
place in the Eastern Conference with 12 games remaining in the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur made 11 saves for the Devils and Peter Skudra
made 34 saves for the Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We scored when we needed it,'' said Robbie Ftorek, the Devils'
coach. ``They kept working, kept plugging away and took advantage
of some power plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering Thursday night's match, the Devils led the Penguins by
1 point in the Atlantic Division, the difference between the
Eastern Conference's second-seeded and the fourth-seeded team in
the playoffs. The Carolina Hurricanes, leaders of the Southeast
Division, were the third-seeded team in the East before Thursday
night's games. As the season nears its end, these numbers become
more relevant as the teams fight for home-ice advantage in the
post-season.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's third-period rally began with the team playing
aggressive, hard-nosed hockey in the opening minutes. And it didn't
take long for it to pay off. That's when Bombardir scored his first
goal of the season to knot the score at 3-3. The goal, only the
second of his career, sailed over Skudra's left shoulder and into
the corner of the net at 5 minutes 22 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to get it in the air,'' Bombardir said with
a shrug. ``It found the net.''
</P>
<P>
   Bombardir, who hit the post earlier in the third period, was
assigned, along with his defensive partner Scott Niedermayer, to
mark the Jagr line. And for 60 minutes, they silenced the Penguins'
top forwards.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr, who assisted on Matthew Barnaby's first-period goal on a
power play, entered the game with 15 points in his last eight
games. But that assist was a soft one, a dump-in that Brodeur
bobbled, allowing Barnaby to put in the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora's power-play goal at 11:28 of the third period gave the
Devils a 4-3 lead and all they would need to dispose of the
Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a little meeting before the game,'' Sykora said of a
talk he had with his linemates, Elias and Jason Arnott. ``Something
was wrong, we didn't score in a couple of games.'' Sykora's line
scored three of the Devils' five goals Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The opening period was fast and crisp and featured plenty of
scoring. The Penguins emerged with a 3-2 advantage on goals by
Aleksei Kovalev, Jan Hrdina and Barnaby. Randy McKay and Arnott
scored the Devils' first-period goals.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer appeared to give New Jersey a 2-1 lead on the power
play at 12:36, but Referee Mark Faucette took the goal away because
Sykora's skate entered Skudra's crease before the puck did. The
fans howled in protest, but just as they settled down, Arnott got
them out of their seats again, 22 seconds later, after he scored on
the same power play. It was Arnott's 23d goal of the season.  &QL;

CUP DRIVERS CRASHING BUSCH PARTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK HERRIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Sterling Marlin's head pops back and his
eyes widen. He has realized what's happening in his sport.
</P>
<P>
   There's a transition happening, and Marlin is in the middle.
He's also in the middle of the Busch Grand National garage, which
looks more like a get-together of recognizable Winston Cup drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Cup drivers, including Marlin, are flooding the Busch Grand
National series, and 17 of them will start in tomorrow's Coca-Cola
300. And that influx has helped the feeder series steadily become
more fan friendly.
</P>
<P>
   The increase of Cup drivers racing to Busch is adding to the
excitement and competition, but it's also adding to the
controversy. The concern, from some veterans, is about the future
of the series as Busch drivers are losing possible spots to
full-time Cup drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are they trying to do, make this another Winston Cup
series?,'' said Randy LaJoie, who won back-to-back Busch
championships in 1996-97. ``The influx of money and technology is
outpricing the Busch guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Others think it only helps increase the interest in the Busch
Series.
</P>
<P>
   This year's race at the Texas Motor Speedway, which includes Cup
stars Jeff Gordon, Mark Martin and Terry Labonte, is expected to
draw a larger crowd. Tickets sales are up 15,000 over last season's
race, which drew more than 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past there wasn't enough Busch drivers to field a race,
and now they have enough and it's an issue,'' said Michael Waltrip,
a Winston Cup regular who drives the No. 21 Band-Aid Chevrolet in
Busch races. ``It's really kind of silly. I feel the Busch drivers
should be happy we're running with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cup drivers have made an impact on the Busch series this
season. Of the top 10 in the point standings, three are regular Cup
drivers _ Kevin Lepage, Jeff Burton and Martin. Lajoie, also in the
top 10, runs a part-time Cup schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But the controversy surrounds the Cup drivers coming in and
bouncing young Busch drivers from qualifying. Younger drivers are
attempting to gain experience week to week and are now having to
fight past Cup champions like Gordon and Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones that get hurt are the ones that can't say anything
about it,'' said Todd Bodine, who drives the No. 66 Phillips
Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   But Matt Kenseth, in his fourth year in the Busch series, hasn't
had much trouble running ahead of the new competition. He is the
current points leader, ahead of Lepage.
</P>
<P>
   While NASCAR has no rules concerning the number of Cup drivers
participating in the Busch series, some believe there should be.
But NASCAR manager of communications Tim Sullivan said there are no
immediate plans to legislate against the practice of driving in
both series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can really see the Busch guys' side,'' Marlin said. ``They
have a sponsor all year, and a Cup guy comes in and knocks you out
of the race. But I don't know what can be done to fix that.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Brett Bodine, ``I don't think it's right. To be honest, I
wish there were a way to prevent it. We're knocking people out of
Busch who are trying to make a living.''

ANOTHER LABONTE SET FOR GRAND ENTRANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as he has done with sons Terry and Bobby, Bob Labonte will
be at a racetrack next weekend, to strap-in the family's next
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Labonte, the son of two-time NASCAR Winston Cup champion
Terry Labonte and Bob's grandson, is scheduled to make his NASCAR
Busch Grand National Series debut in the BellSouth Mobility 320 at
Nashville Speedway USA in Tennessee on April 3.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Labonte was not in the garage area at Texas Motor
Speedway yesterday, where his father qualified the No. 44 Slim Jim
Chevrolet Monte Carlo 14th. Justin was in class at Trinity (N.C.)
High School, where he plans to graduate this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he's only 18,'' Bob Labonte said. ``But when Bobby was
18, he'd already been racing for 13 years. Justin's been racing
about four years. When I'm out with him at the track, it's almost
scary sometimes. I think I'm with Terry again. Only now I'm 65, and
I was 40 back then. They're a lot alike. Their tempers are about
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin started racing in 1996, and Terry Labonte said he still
has mixed feelings about his son's impending career choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my case, how could I tell my son he couldn't do it?'' said
Labonte, the Cup champion in 1984 and 1996. ``I mean, there's
pictures of him hanging on the wall at home when I won my first
championship, and he was 2 or 3 years old. And if you're going to
be successful in this business, you've got to start young.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin has competed in Mini-Stocks, Grand American cars and most
recently in the Hooters ProCup Series. But everyone in the family
realizes the jump to BGN _ even on a relatively tight short-track
like Nashville _ is huge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got mixed feelings about that,'' Terry Labonte said. ``I
told him, `If you don't want to race this thing, it doesn't matter
to me.' He tested there \RTuesday and Wednesday\S and didn't get
too many laps in. But I talked to him Wednesday night and he said,
`I think we'll be all right.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Labonte carries the title of Shop Foreman/Pit Foreman on the
Labonte Racing duty roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Bob's job description is being Bob,'' said Dick Conway,
the team's public relations representative. ``He's been doing this
for so long that he's the voice of wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Terry Labonte never really worries about Justin when
Bob is with him at the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty proud of his grandson,'' Terry said. ``And it
makes me proud. I've only gone to a few races with him, but when he
gets out of the car, I can't believe it's Justin. Looks like he's
been doing it for years.''
QUICK HITS
ATWOOD CRASHES, LEARNS
</P>
<P>
   Busch rookie Casey Atwood made headlines with a spectacular
tumbling crash on the final lap of the 1999 season-opener at
Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   And he learned a valuable public-relations lesson: There is no
such thing as bad publicity. There is just publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is still talking about it,'' said Atwood, driver of
the No. 27 Castrol GTX Chevy. ``It wasn't the way we wanted to get
attention, but it worked, I guess. The main thing is we were
running up front when it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood, an 18-year-old resident of Nashville, Tenn., was racing
in second when he got tapped from behind and went airborne.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a shock break with about 12 laps to go, so I was trying
to hang on to what I had,'' Atwood said. ``I remember everything
that happened, but it's hard to explain. You can feel it going up
in the air and once it's up in the air, you don't know where you're
at, or how many times you've flipped. It's kind of a weird feeling.
You sit there and hold on, and wait for it to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all of it was over, I was real thankful I was OK. I knew
I wasn't hurt and hoped nobody else had gotten hurt. It was a wild
ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood said his father, Terry, was at the track that day. But
his mother, Jan, had the misfortune of watching it on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably the worst place to watch it because they
showed so many replays before they knew if I was OK or not,''
Atwood said. ``And then they still wanted to see me, and make sure
I was all right. I'm sure it was pretty scary for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was real nervous. Even on the plane ride home, he was
still shaking. That tore him up pretty good. He don't want me to do
that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood will start 18th tomorrow in the Coca-Cola 300 after
posting a lap at 179.497 mph. His best finish in four starts this
season is fifth at Rockingham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first win is right under our nose,'' said Atwood, who is
in the first year of a three-year contract with Castrol. ``We're
waiting for some good luck.''
BLANEY MOVES ON
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola 300 pole-winner Dave Blaney has not dwelled on the one
that got away _ his on again/off again victory in the Yellow
Freight 300 this month at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Blaney originally finished second to Mike Skinner, who had his
first BGN victory taken away the next morning after NASCAR
inspectors discovered an illegal cylinder head during a post-race
inspection. Skinner's team appealed, however, and the victory was
returned to the No. 19 team the following Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have been satisfied with that win,'' said Blaney, driver
of the No. 93 Amoco Pontiac Grand Prix. ``It wouldn't have been as
much fun as winning it outright, but still we were running good
enough all day to win. And hey, you've got to be in that position
\Rto win\S. Heck yeah, it would have been good with me to get one
in the record book.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaney is winless in 25 BGN starts in a career launched last
year with car-owner Bill Davis. But Blaney knows how to win. He was
the 1995 World of Outlaws Sprint Car champion, and was runner-up in
the Sprint Car series in 1993, 1994, 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting there,'' said Blaney, speaking about the
transition from open-wheel cars to stock cars. ``The more laps I
can run, the better I feel.''
Burton got it right
</P>
<P>
   The right side Goodyear Eagle radial tires being run in the BGN
and Winston Cup events are the direct result of Cup star Jeff
Burton's tire test here in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the grip that the track had, most of the \Rright side\S
tires we had blistered up real bad,'' said Burton, who qualified
the No. 9 Track Gear Ford Taurus 11th yesterday at 179.922 mph.
``They had to come back with a different compound than what they
had for the test. The tire they brought back is a hard tire, but
it's going to be a safe tire.''

JUNIOR ACHIEVER: LITTLE E READY FOR LAUNCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ They started handing out boarding passes to
the Dale Earnhardt Jr. bandwagon in Victory Lane at Texas Motor
Speedway a year ago. And take corporate America's word for it: This
flight will be full by the time ``Little E'' makes his NASCAR
Winston Cup debut in May.
</P>
<P>
   Because as Earnhardt Jr. has come to learn in the months since
he won NASCAR's Busch Grand National series championship and landed
a blockbuster $10 million, five-year contract with Budweiser, there
always is room for one more.
</P>
<P>
   Just one more high-profile associate sponsor, one more
endorsement contract, one more autograph session, one more
one-on-11 with the media. And one more can of beer on the road to
``Countdown to E-Day,'' his sponsor's official promotional campaign
for the 24-year-old stock car driver many believe is the future of
motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   As of today, Earnhardt Jr. is 67 days away from competing in his
first points-paying Cup race, the Coca-Cola 600 at the renamed
Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect brings a mischievous grin to the gaunt face of
Earnhardt, a son of the seven-time Winston Cup champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time anybody makes a comment about the `Countdown to
E-Day,' I re-correct them and tell them it's a countdown to my
first qualifying attempt,'' Earnhardt Jr. said. ``Because that's
what it is. Everybody knows how difficult it is to make these
\RCup\S races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you could sit there and let it pressure you _ `Countdown
to E-Day' _ because they're expecting me to be in that race.
Nobody's even thought that we might miss it. Know what I'm saying?
But that ain't the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr.'s best finish in five BGN races this season is a
third at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Fifth in the driver's points, he
qualified 12th yesterday for tomorrow's event with a hot lap at
179.850 mph.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a series-leading seven BGN victories, Earnhardt
Jr. posted three poles, 16 top-five and 22 top-10 finishes in 1998.
He crushed the single-season money record with $1,387,461 in
winnings. He finished 48 points ahead of friend and rival Matt
Kenseth, another rising Busch star who is not surprised by the buzz
surrounding Earnhardt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, he's run awesome,'' said Kenseth, who also is
planning a five-race Cup schedule this year. ``If he was Dale
Earnhardt Jr. and ran 10th or 15th every week and never did
anything, I don't think everybody would be paying as much attention
to him. But he's earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cup star Jeff Burton, who races regularly against Earnhardt Jr.
in the BGN series, said he has been taken aback by the Little
Earnhardt Express.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's out of whack, but that's sports,'' said Burton, winner of
the first Cup race at TMS in 1997. ``It's like that in every sport.
But he hasn't been given anything, in the sense that his father's
been able to help him. But his father made him earn it. I think
everybody respects him for that. Everybody in here \Rthe Cup garage
area\S had somebody help them to get where they are. Nobody in here
did it on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``And a `name' is not going to win you races.''
</P>
<P>
   When he runs an abbreviated five-race Cup schedule with his
championship-winning Busch crew led by Tony Eury Sr. and Tony Eury
Jr., Earnhardt Jr. will need more than his name to qualify. No free
rides for stock-car racing's designated superstar. He will need to
post one of the top-36 fastest speeds to make the starting grid at
LMS.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kinda get mad about it,'' said Earnhardt Jr., driver of
the No. 3 ACDelco Chevrolet Monte Carlo owned by his famous dad.
``I'd be a complete idiot for not realizing the fact I might not
make that race. If I don't, I'll get death threats, for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   He is kidding, of course. And if Earnhardt Jr.'s meteoric rise
to stardom has robbed him of his privacy, it has not completely
rubbed out his sense of self.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like you're doing stand-up comedy every time
you're up there,'' said Earnhardt Jr., who has learned on the fly
how to conduct himself before rooms full of executives, media and
fans. ``You're a race-car driver, you're not a spokesperson. You're
not an actor, so they're waiting on you to say something stupid.
You got to stand up there and do the best you can.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm enjoying it enough to where it's worth it, still. I'm
a long way before I get burned out. I sure hope I ain't. I still
enjoy, by far, driving race cars more than, I think, anybody on the
racetrack. I mean, I just have so much fun with it. It's a long
time before I get too fed up with everything else to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know?''
</P>
<P>
   Budweiser is counting on it. The brewery giant shocked the
NASCAR world last fall when it signed Earnhardt Jr., who had yet to
win his first BGN title, to a five-year contract. After running
five Cup events this year, Earnhardt Jr. will take on the full
schedule in 2000. His contract with Bud runs through 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's amazing is the breadth and the depth of this
contract,'' said Don Hawk, the president of Dale Earnhardt Inc.,
and Earnhardt Jr.'s agent/negotiator. ``The kid's never driven a
Winston Cup car yet in his life, in a points race, and he's
probably already earned more money than a lot of people that have
driven for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange phenomenon. You look at him _ that's not a
cookie-cutter racer.''
</P>
<P>
   Little E was six races into the 1998 schedule, and coming off a
career-best runner-up effort at Bristol Motor Speedway, when he
rolled into TMS last April. He qualified 16th, his second-worst
effort of the season, on the track's ``old'' tight, 1.5-mile
configuration.
</P>
<P>
   But Earnhardt Jr. was running second to Cup regular Joe Nemechek
when the green flag fell with six laps to go. Dale Jr. began to
reel Nemechek in and then made the race-winning pass exiting Turn 4
_ an area that continually had been criticized as being one-groove
and too narrow for side-by-side racing _ on the last lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It raised my stock a whole lot, to where a lot of people were
paying attention to see if we could do it again,'' said Earnhardt
Jr., whose father watched the closing laps from the top of a
transporter in the garage area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty neat, him being there, because I wasn't sitting
there expecting a win at any time,'' Earnhardt Jr. said. ``It was
such a special day for me, and the rest of the team. For him to
have been there, and seeing how happy he was, it was kinda cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Reigning and three-time Cup champion Jeff Gordon, who will join
Earnhardt Jr. in the BGN lineup here, said Little E has shown
tremendous talent on the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm impressed by that,'' said Gordon, 27. ``But he's got a lot
of pressure on him. I feel for him because I know as a rookie the
type of pressure I felt. You'd like to go out and just do it _ and
not have everybody talk about it. I was able to do that because I
didn't have a `name' and wasn't driving for Dale Earnhardt.''

NASH NOT SINGING BLUES ABOUT BOOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The thought jolted Steve Nash like the boos that
rattled his eardrums Wednesday night at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they just don't like me, for whatever reason, which is
fine,'' the Mavericks' starting point guard said. ``They pay their
money to come watch us play, and they have every right to voice or
express their feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``they'' Nash was referring to are Mavericks fans who booed
him every time he touched the ball in the second half of
Wednesday's 88-78 loss to Houston. Nash, who was 0-of-8 from the
field in the first half, was greeted with a shower of boos when he
entered the game with about five minutes left in the third period,
and every time he touched the ball thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   The only time the fans let up was when Nash took and made his
only second-half shot, a 3-pointer midway through the final
quarter. Otherwise, they treated the 6-foot-3, third-year veteran
as if he were an opposing ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the ``attack,' Nash got up early and did a
15-minute radio interview. He later headed to practice and was the
last player to leave the Mavericks' afternoon session at the Tom
Landry Center.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the most embarrassing moment of his basketball
life, Nash couldn't pinpoint why the fans singled him out when
almost every Mavericks player this side of Shawn Bradley and A.C.
Green is struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``My teammates pointed out to me that a lot of guys were missing
shots,'' Nash said. ``I don't know if that meant don't worry about
it, or if that meant I don't know why they're getting on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks coach/general manager Don Nelson talked with Nash
before practice yesterday to assure him that he's firmly in his
corner, regardless of some fans' apparent disdain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just said I'm sticking with you, and we'll just go through
this together,'' Nash said. ``That was nice to hear, because I
didn't know if he felt the same way the fans did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks acquired Nash in a trade with Phoenix in June. The
Mavericks will part with their first-round draft pick this summer _
probably a lottery pick _ because of the Nash deal. The Mavericks
also gave Nash a six-year, $33 million contract extension before
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Nash is making only 34.6 percent of his field-goal attempts,
second worst on the team behind Chris Anstey's 29.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it is the contract,'' Nash said of the fan's reaction.
``Maybe I should point out to them that I'm a $1 million point
guard this year. I haven't gotten those big checks yet. I'll do my
work over the summer and be a $5 million point guard next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Nash nor Nelson knows what kind of reception to expect
when the Mavericks play host to Denver tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I'll go out there and the fans will boo me again, and
I'll just play my game,'' Nash said. ``I just have confidence in
myself. I had confidence before last night's game that I was going
to have a great game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just month or two of a long career in Dallas. So
you've just got to wait and be patient.''

TWO BY TWO, TCU BREEZES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The Horned Frogs did their damage in pairs
yesterday at the TCU Baseball Diamond. Two runs here, two runs
there.
</P>
<P>
   But it added up to an 8-2 victory against San Diego State,
boosting the Horned Frogs into sole possession of first place in
the Western Athletic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I don't think much about first now,'' TCU coach
Lance Brown said. ``But it's victories like this that will make a
difference when first is on the line at the end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   This victory was built in two-run increments.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest pair was provided by first baseman David Wallace. He
sent a ball screaming over the right-field fence in the third
inning to drive in two runs.
</P>
<P>
   TCU (16-13, 8-2 WAC) also had scored two runs in the first
inning, both coming on groundouts, and catcher Mark Silva singled
in two more in the seventh inning. Triples by Mike Hamilton and
Eric McLamore along with a single by Wallace accounted for TCU's
two eighth-inning runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was out before I had a chance to go very far,'' said
Wallace, who finished 3-for-5 with three runs batted in and also
scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   Frogs right-hander Shawn Thompson (5-4) assured the numbers were
enough. He went seven innings, allowing two runs on five hits while
striking out eight. It was the third strong outing in conference
play for Thompson, who came in sporting back-to-back complete games
in the WAC.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego State (15-15, 5-5 WAC) threatened in the third, fifth,
sixth and seventh innings, but Thompson managed to get himself out
of trouble each time.
</P>
<P>
   The Aztecs' best chance came in the seventh. They had runners on
second and third with two outs, but Thompson got a fly ball to
right field to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs entered yesterday's game tied for first with Rice and
San Jose State. Rice begins a three-game series against Nevada-Las
Vegas today; San Jose State has a nonconference game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, so we're in first by percentages,'' Wallace said. ``That's
all right. We'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs and Aztecs play the second in the three-game series at
2:35 today at the TCU Baseball Diamond.

GIVING A WHOLE LOT BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Royce Clayton remembers the day Dodgers
outfielder Ken Landreaux came to his school in Los Angeles for
Career Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Does anybody here want to be a major-league baseball
player?' '' Clayton said. ``The whole class laughed and pointed at
me. He said, `If that's what you want to do, good for you.' He was
very positive and made me feel good about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also gave me a bat. I kept it in my closet for a long time,
then used it until it cracked.''
</P>
<P>
   The memory, and many others from his Los Angeles childhood, left
Clayton determined not only to become an All-Star shortstop, but an
athlete who emulates the many positive influences in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were always positive influences there for me,'' Clayton
said. ``Every time I started doubting myself, there was always
someone there for me being positive and telling me things were
going to be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' thoughtful, soft-spoken shortstop has other
motivating forces. He remembers a darker time, the day Shannon
Coleman, his close friend going back to nursery school, committed
suicide while at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those things that a lot of black men go
through,'' Clayton said. ``It affects every race. He was at a point
in life where he felt he had no alternatives. So he chose that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of my closest friends, always encouraging me. He
really believed in me ... almost to the point more than he believed
in himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton, talking outside the Rangers' clubhouse one morning
earlier this week, paused to consider one of the worst moments of
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people do you know from growing up who committed
suicide?'' he asked. ``Any? I know four or five from when I grew
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've dedicated my career to Shannon.''
</P>
<P>
   That dedication has taken many forms.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton is not the cliche rags-to-riches story, someone who
fought his way out of bleak poverty to become a major- league
superstar.
</P>
<P>
   He was brought up by loving, devoted parents who stressed
education over athletics. He lived in a safe neighborhood in the
North Inglewood section of Los Angeles, where he could ride his
bicycle to school and walk to the local Little League field.
</P>
<P>
   He is a person who appreciates the tremendous support he
received in his youth from his parents, teachers, coaches and role
models, and has devoted his off-field energies to see that others
receive the same advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank God for what I had,'' Clayton said. ``It's what every
kid needs growing up. If the support system is there and he
receives positive encouragement, he'll respond in a positive way.
Tell a kid he's a loser and he'll always be a loser and that
society dictates he's going to go bad, all the negatives, then he's
going to go the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   In appreciation of what he has been given, he and his parents,
Royal and Antoinette Clayton, have become involved in a number of
charitable causes under the umbrella of the Royce Clayton Family
Foundation, from their work with the Sickle Cell Disease
Association of America to endowing a college scholarship through
the Jackie Robinson Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Royce and \Rhis brother\S Royal were always taught that your
abilities are a gift from God,'' Antoinette Clayton said. ``But you
always have people who are not as fortunate as you are. You get to
a point in your life where you say, `thank you for my blessings,
now let me help somebody else.' That's the way we raised our kids,
and I think Royce understands that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton was not always such a perfect child. One Sunday, Mrs.
Clayton noticed something strange about one of the acolytes at the
altar of the Christ Good Shepherd Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed he was wearing his baseball uniform under his
acolyte robes,'' Mrs. Clayton said. ``I noticed because he was
wearing his white baseball socks. He said he had a game after
church and didn't know if he'd have time to go home and put his
uniform on.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball was that important to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports kept me off the streets and out of trouble,'' Clayton
said. ``Anything like that is worthwhile and positive. It's not so
much developing kids into major leaguers but just to give them
something to do where they can get positive encouragement and
motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports were not stressed in the Clayton household. Education
was, and both parents worked hard to allow their children to attend
parochial schools. Royal Clayton Jr. _ five years older than Royce
_ wasn't even allowed to play sports until he was 13.
</P>
<P>
   But when Antoinette Clayton discovered Royce was in love with
baseball, she told him about Jackie Robinson and the battles he
went through to integrate the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't forget about your roots, so you teach about the
people in your history so you have an understanding of where you're
from,'' Mrs. Clayton said. ``A lot of minority children aren't
exposed to who their heroes are. Many of them don't even know it
was Charles R. Drew who discovered blood plasma. So we made Royce
aware of the difficult times Jackie Robinson had and a lot of the
difficult times players still have.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton has shown he hasn't forgotten his roots. He bought new
baseball uniforms last year for his old high school, St. Bernard's
in Playa del Rey, Calif., and helped re-build his old Little League
Field in La Dera Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Yarnell, longtime baseball coach at St. Bernard's, said
Clayton has always had a strong impact on the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a tremendous leader,'' Yarnell said. ``When he was on a
baseball field, it was like a little kid going to Disneyland. Now
kids say, `Coach it's sprinkling, are we going to practice?' He
couldn't get wait to get on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would make practices fun. For example, if he and another
player were taking 50 ground balls at shortstop, he'd make a game
of it. He'd make them field a certain number of them cleanly, or
else they'd have to get down and start doing pushups.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton was one of the last of a steady stream of talented
African-American baseball players who came out of the Los Angeles
area in the 1970s and '80s, including Darryl Strawberry, Eric
Davis, Ozzie Smith, Chili Davis and Tony Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   But the stream has almost stopped as facilities have become
rundown, budgets have been cut and programs have been shut down.
That bothers Clayton, who has become involved in Major League
Baseball's Returning Baseball to the Inner Cities (RBI) program.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Little League was in real danger of shutting down,''
Clayton said. ``To have so many memories playing there and then to
see the program dying was painful. So we dumped a lot of money into
it and now it's a much better facility than what I played on.''
BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   The lack of inner-city prospects has forced major-league teams
to rely heavily on Latin American players not subject to the draft,
and money is poured into those countries to build academies and
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   They can't do that in American cities because those players are
subject to the draft. The Los Angeles Dodgers could pour millions
of dollars into that city's youth baseball programs, only to have
the best players drafted by other teams. Any work in that area is
considered part of a team's community service program rather than
true scouting and player development.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, we had the Major League Scouting
Bureau, and they were there just to produce the talent for
everybody,'' Clayton said. ``You don't have that anymore. But I
guarantee, you have the same type of kids with the same talent in
Los Angeles as you do in the Dominican Republic. Teams just don't
put the same kind of money into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is a business. But it's just disappointing to know
the same opportunities I had aren't there anymore. That's why one
of my goals is to become active promoting the game of baseball in
the inner cities and promoting the RBI program.'' END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers gave Clayton $18 million over four years this
off-season because they felt he would be the front-line starting
shortstop the franchise has been sorely lacking for much of the
past 20 years. Club president Tom Schieffer said knowing the kind
of person they were getting made it easier to commit that kind of
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Royce is going be a tremendous addition to this
franchise,'' Schieffer said. ``He's a great athlete and it's a
pleasure to watch him on the field. Off the field, people are going
to understand this is a substantive person who is going to make a
real contribution to our community.''

SELLING PLAYERS WOULD BE CAPITALIST IDEA FOR CASTRO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Much has been made of the international
intrigue and political implications that will swirl around Sunday's
baseball game in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   But in analyzing the whys and whats of the Baltimore Orioles'
visit to Cuba, all Americans should first consider the one major
humanitarian concern.
</P>
<P>
   Will Clark is making the trip. Haven't the Cuban people already
suffered enough?
</P>
<P>
   On these pages several weeks ago, Brother LeBreton made many
pertinent points about the political fallacy of the Orioles falling
into Castro's trap. It's obviously true about this being more than
a simple pitching-batting-and-catching competition, at least for
Fidel and his powerful Cuban National Team.
</P>
<P>
   Castro was not exactly blowing cigar smoke in approving the
Orioles' visit for Sunday's game against Cuba's best. Fidel is up
to something.
</P>
<P>
   But why does it have to be a political foothold he's hoping to
gain across Latin America? That won't feed the hungry mouths on an
island starved for all the basic necessities of life, starting with
three square ones a day.
</P>
<P>
   What makes more sense is the economic impact that Castro can
achieve from suddenly being pals with Major League Baseball. What
if capitalist gears are now swirling in the head of Comrade Fidel?
Don't forget, the ol' Commie was once known as a pretty decent
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, you see, can be Castro's new sugar.
</P>
<P>
   If the U.S. won't buy his cane, or even his cigars, what about
his ballplayers?
</P>
<P>
   ``Open up Cuba to us, and put those players on the market, and
the stampede of major-league scouts into that place might sink the
entire island,'' said Sandy Johnson, the assistant general manager
and director of baseball operations for the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson added, ``That's why Castro, I don't think, would
ever open it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, why should he?
</P>
<P>
   If Castro simply served as an ``agent,'' and placed an
individual value on Cuban players, then sold their contracts direct
to major-league teams ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you're talking,'' said Johnson. ``I've got no way of
knowing what he's up to with Baltimore going in there, but Castro
being ready to talk business with baseball makes a lot of sense to
me. The way it appears, the most valuable commodity in Cuba is
ballplayers.''
</P>
<P>
   As was learned when Johnson spent more than a decade in the
Rangers' front office, no one in baseball knows or appreciates the
Latin market or Latin players more than he.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers once had the strongest presence in Puerto Rico and
were one of the first organizations to cultivate and farm the
hot-hot-hot market in the Dominican Republic. Sammy Sosa came out
of that first Dominican wave in the mid-'80s.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuba always has been Johnson's dream conquest. ``It's the
mother lode _ the sleeping giant,'' he said. ``For 40 years under
Castro, that island has gone untapped, other than a handful who
floated their way out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   There has long been a school of thought that the Cubans are
better players overall than the Puerto Ricans or the Dominicans,
and if Castro ever lifted his curtain the majors would be swamped
with Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go that far,'' said Johnson, ``because we aren't on
that island to see the kids at 12, 13, 14 years old. But without
question, it would be big, real big.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 600 players from the Dominican Republic
were signed by major-league teams. That is more than from
California, the state that annually has the most signees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see Cuba being any less than the Dominican,'' said
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question there are players on Cuba's national team
who, if rafted off the island, would command a signing bonus of $5
million plus.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we aren't even talking about those of high school age who
play baseball 12 months a year,'' said Johnson. ``The best young
ones will go for a couple of million.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also not far-fetched to think Castro could produce 500
players a year signing major-league contracts for a total profit to
Cuba of some $200 million. And then if Castro also arranged to
receive a cut of their contracts after the players made the majors,
well ...
</P>
<P>
   ``What else does Cuba have to sell that would bring more?''
Johnson said. ``The few who have gotten out have received huge
dollars, and their success in the majors is certainly well-known in
Cuba. Every kid who is playing catch in that country is also
building a raft. He wants out.''
</P>
<P>
   If Fidel becomes directly involved in the baseball business,
then the profit is his. Could that be why the Orioles are in Cuba
on Sunday?

NASCAR HANDYMAN POINTED SERIES IN RIGHT DIRECTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY D. BOGGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Bob Latford has been around NASCAR for as
long as there has been a NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1948 he has worked in concession stands, sold programs,
help score, spotted for radio and public-address announcers,
written books, published newsletters and compiled statistics for TV
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps most importantly, he developed the points system
used in NASCAR today.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you scoring at home, the system works like this:
175 points are given to the winner of a Winston Cup points event,
170 points to the runner-up and on down to 34 points for the
last-place finisher. Oh, even the drivers who fail to qualify for a
race earn points. Plus, there are five bonus points for leading a
lap (meaning the race winner automatically earns 180 points) and
five bonus points for leading the most laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I hated math in high school,'' the 63-year-old Concord,
N.C., resident says.
</P>
<P>
   At least the points system is fairly easy to figure out. In
1974, NASCAR was using its third system in four years. Among the
variables involved were the size of a track, the number of laps ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so complicated the competitors couldn't figure it
out,'' Latford said. ``And I said at the time if the competitors
don't know what they have to do, then the fans sure don't
understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Latford met with NASCAR officials at a ``watering hole'' and
began diddling on the back of a napkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``My rationale at the time was that every race counts the
same,'' Latford said. ``Because the championship should be based on
not the races you won but what you did in the races you didn't
win.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR success is told in top 5s and top 10s. So the first
through six spots are separated by five points per position (175
for No. 1 to 150 for No. 6), and Nos. 7 (146 points) through 11
(130) are separated by four points per position. After No. 11, the
difference becomes three points (127 for No. 12, 124 for No. 13 and
so on).
</P>
<P>
   Latford compares it to golf. ``If I go out and get a hole-in-one
on all of the par-3s but triple-bogey all the others, and you par
every hole, you'll win the round.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Latford wanted to reward the Curtis Turners,
Fireball Roberts and Junior Johnsons _ drivers who never won a
championship but drove hard and put on a show but might not finish
a race because of how they raced.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, he added the bonus points.
</P>
<P>
   Latford isn't opposed to change. He'd like to see bonus points
added for a pole. But he points out that ``the system works.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Petty won the last championship under the old rules in
1974. He also won the 1975 championship under the current system.
</P>
<P>
   And Latford does some other math thinking about the points
system, ``his'' points system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got paid for it,'' he said with a laugh. ``If I had a
tenth of 1 percent of the prize money distributed under the points
system, I wouldn't be here working.''

McDONALD'S OFFERS MINI-FURBY FIGURES 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Keith Lopaty saw business increase 50 percent at
the five San Fernando Valley McDonald's restaurants he owns when
the fast-food chain offered Teeny Beanie Babies toys with its Happy
Meal combos each of the last two springs.
</P>
<P>
   He expects to see something close to the same when 3-inch
Furbies -- that electronic interactive toy that was all the rage
this past holiday season -- start popping up with the ever-popular
Happy Meal beginning today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'll be popular. I'm optimistic,'' he said. ``I don't
think it'll be Beanie Babies -- Beanie Babies was our best ever.
This will probably be the second-best ever, would be my guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The figures attract youngsters who drag their parents into
McDonald's to buy them. And their parents, in turn, buy meals for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we sell a lot of Happy Meals, it helps our business,''
Lopaty said. ``It helps pretty dramatically in certain instances.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Murray, a spokeswoman for Oak Brook, Ill.-based McDonald's
Corp., said the company had been working on turning the Furby into
a Happy Meals figurine since spotting the toy last year at the
International Toy Fair in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always looking for hot properties,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There are 80 variants of the little critters, all miniature
sculpted figurines resembling the furry mechanical toys that media
hype turned into the most coveted toy of December '98.
</P>
<P>
   Like the big Furby, the McDonald's figures can do things like
move their feet or wiggle their ears or let loose with a little
growl. Unlike it's big cousin, however, these little ones are not
electronic and don't need batteries to perform their feats.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the new figures so far has been positive, Murray
said. ``They capture the essence of the real retail Furby,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be available through April 22 or while supplies last.
They come in eight toy types and in 10 body and color combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Lopaty thinks the mini-Furby toys stand a good chance of
becoming collectors' items, in part because there are so many
varieties that some customers may make it a mission to capture them
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people will be driving around trying to collect them
all,'' he said. ``Who knows, maybe 20 years from now, they'll be
sitting back thinking, Wasn't I smart?''

   KOSOVO-RUSSIA-ASSESS (Moscow) _ Russia has railed against the

West. By Michael R. Gordon.

   KOSOVO-EUROPE-REAX (London) _ Europeans reacted with a mix of

L.A. PROMOTERS LAUNCH FAREWELL BOOSTER CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- After five years and an $18 million budget, the
group that brought you the slogan ``Together, we're the best. Los
Angeles'' goes out of business this month with a final advertising
blitz.
</P>
<P>
   The New Los Angeles Marketing Partnership is saying goodbye in
advertisements that began Wednesday in which it brags about the
region and the role it played in boosting the city's image.
</P>
<P>
   A second advertisement boasts of the city's selection as host
city to the 2000 Democratic National Convention, by saying, ``The
donkey has landed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We promised that we would be in business only five years, and
this is it,'' said Tracy Olmstead Williams of Casey Sayre &AMP;
Williams Inc., the firm that provided public relations for NewLAMP.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started when the mayor came and said we need to do
something to restore faith in the business community but didn't
want a quasi-governmental agency that would stay in business
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said NewLAMP has helped turn around the city's image
and worked to keep some 125 firms from leaving and saving 25,000
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this was started, the line going around was, the last
person leaving Los Angeles, please turn off the lights,'' Williams
said. ``That was when Los Angeles was noted for fire, floods,
earthquakes, the Rodney King beating and the O.J. (Simpson) trial.
We've turned that around.''
</P>
<P>
   NewLAMP Executive Director Regina Birdsell said she is most
proud that the organization was able to fulfill its promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``When NewLAMP started, there was a poll showing four of five
people wanted to leave Los Angeles,'' Birdsell said. ``We took
another poll recently and better than 70 percent said they were
optimistic about the city and its future.''
</P>
<P>
   NewLAMP was the brainchild of Mayor Richard Riordan, and he is
pleased with the group's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel more confident today than they did five years
ago,'' Deputy Mayor Noelia Rodriguez said. ``While the mayor is
never satisfied, he thinks they did accomplish getting the word out
to the people who live here, in the region and the rest of the
country, that Los Angeles is the greatest city.''
</P>
<P>
   With an initial contribution from the city and county, Riordan
turned to the business community for funds.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also grew to include a number of other cities, most
notably Long Beach, and groups as diverse as the Los Angeles
Chamber of Commerce and the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor,
AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of its work, the group has come up with other
themes, such as ``It's amazing what grows in L.A.,'' touting
different businesses and ``L.A.'s Amazing People.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't take credit for the turnaround in the economy,''
Birdsell said. ``We were just there at the time. But we have been
able to educate people about the different businesses we have in
this city. Five years ago, people would have said the two main
industries here are defense and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, they know Los Angeles is first in fashion and
manufacturing, that the economy is so spread out we can afford a
hit in one.''
</P>
<P>
   NewLAMP's work will continue in the form of an organization
being called the New Alliance that will work through the Los
Angeles Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Birdsell said it will continue the advertising campaign and also
go into new areas of dealing with government at the state and local
level to work on behalf of entrepreneurs.

CARLISLE'S HEROICS GIVE CAL THE TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Geno Carlisle did not know whether it was the rigors
of the extended run into the post-season or simply the struggles of
an untimely slump, but throughout Thursday night's game here at
Madison Square Garden, he seemed a step slow, a bit sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he know why in the final seconds of the National
Invitation Tournament's championship game everything around him
suddenly seemed in slow motion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amid the chaos, Carlisle, a senior at the University of
California, calmly moved through the crowd of players, ignoring the
pressure of the moment. He attempted a game-tying jump shot, which
was blocked, but somehow, between three Clemson defenders, Carlisle
knocked the loose ball back to himself, picked it up and elevated
into the lane. He hanged in the air, drawing a foul while calmly
dropping in an eight-foot jumper with 4.7 seconds to play to tie
the score, then converted the free throw that beat Clemson, 61-60.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Golden Bears' first post-season title since winning
the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament 40 years
ago, also by a point, against West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of funny, the last two games were two of my worst
games of the season, offensively,'' said Carlisle, who was just 4
of 18 from the floor Thursday night. ``I got that shot blocked and
then everything went in slow motion. I knew I had to at least tie
it up. Everything was slow and on that play a rush just went
through me.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that it was the NIT, a tournament in which bragging
rights consist of, ``We're number 65,'' rather than the NCAA
tournament, did not diminish the moment as Carlisle embraced his
father, Clarence, on the court, while teammates danced with the
California flag.
</P>
<P>
   In making its run to the title, California benefited from a
group of four seniors, each of whom transferred to the school two
years year ago and endured an NCAA-imposed ban from post-season
play last year. Sean Lampley, the lone starter this season not
among the seniors, was named the tournament's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday night, it was Carlisle, who began his career at
Northwestern, stepping into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling for the coaches and players,'' coach Ben
Braun said. ``Those are the only ones who were there making the
sacrifice. This started last year with no prize on the horizon.
With Geno, he's as great a reflection of our team as anyone. When
it's the last shot, there was no question that we wanted the ball
in his hands. He deserved a chance to win the game, and he found a
way.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   California was forced to play without its second-leading scorer,
the senior Thomas Kilgore, whose bruised left thigh muscle
tightened Thursday night.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the consolation game, Xavier beat Oregon by 106-75 behind 34
points by Lenny Brown, who made 10 of 15 shots from the floor,
including six 3-point field goals. James Posey and Maurice McAfee
added 17 points each for the Musketeers.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The NBA's Rookie All-Star Game was not canceled because of the
lockout after all. The prodigies of the Rockets and Raptors held
the game Thursday night at Compaq Center.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toronto's Vince Carter won the dunk contest and likely all sorts
of praise and endorsement deals. The Rockets won the game, with
Michael Dickerson and Cuttino Mobley outgunning the spectacular
Raptors rookie to lift the Rockets to a 113-104 win, extending
their winning streak to six as they head to a five-game, nine-day
road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dickerson and Mobley were hitting unconsciously, and it was
just impossible for us to win,'' Raptors guard Doug Christie said.
``I've never seen anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson and Mobley had their season highs by the first minutes
of the fourth quarter, so it hardly mattered that Rockets center
Hakeem Olajuwon, who had been enjoying another in a recent run of
sharp-shooting nights, was tossed out of the game with 2:55 left in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon was ejected for retaliating after taking a pair of
elbows to the chest from Toronto strongman Charles Oakley. Olajuwon
said Oakley was ``evil'' and had intentionally tried to injure him.
Olajuwon was cited for a Level 2 flagrant foul, which makes him
eligible for a suspension, although that would remain up to the
discretion of the NBA office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for a player like that,'' Olajuwon said. ``To see
someone who has that kind of mind, to injure somebody in the flow
of the game, I tried to think of some excuse for him, to see what
he's thinking, but there was no excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Olajuwon was lost Thursday, Dickerson had taken
over the game and Mobley was about to.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Carter) is being called Rookie of the Year, which he's
deserving of,'' Dickerson said. ``He's a great player; he's a tough
matchup for anybody. But Cuttino is such a competitor, Vince being
`Rookie of the Year,' I think Cuttino was competing with Vince. And
I saw Cuttino competing with him, and I just wanted to compete with
him. Cuttino and I just played off each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley and Dickerson each made seven of nine 3-pointers to set
Rockets rookie records for 3s in a game and send the Rockets to a
team record of 17 treys. Dickerson finished with 28 points, making
10 of 15 shots and adding five assists and three steals, matching
season bests. Mobley added 26 points.
</P>
<P>
   Carter led all scorers with his season-high 32, including a
dunk-contest 360-degree slam, a high-flying finger roll and several
fadeaways that could be fairly described as Jordanesque.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of did feel it,'' Dickerson said. ``Every time I shot
the ball, I felt like it was going in. I knew Cuttino was feeling
it. I could see it in his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley, two games removed from an 0-for-5 while concentrating on
defending Sacramento rookie Jason Williams, followed his 7-of-11
shooting night at Dallas on Wednesday by making eight of 12 on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I hit that many 3s,'' Mobley said. ``I kept
shooting. I was in a slump awhile ago. I heard some commentators on
TV say some bad things about me. But I've got to roll with those
punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really feeling it out there. The slump hurt me because I
am a better shooter than that. The shots went in for me against
Dallas and again tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing was ideal. Besides losing Olajuwon in the third
quarter, the Rockets played the second of back-to-back games
weakened and short-handed. Sam Mack was out with a sprained right
thumb. Matt Bullard did not play while battling the flu. Scottie
Pippen played 42 minutes but was clearly feeling the effects of the
flu, doubling over several times early in the fourth quarter but
finishing with 16 points and 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley spent much of the game battling pain in his back
and his left knee but came within one assist of a triple double,
with 16 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets took control of the game on the strength of
their rookies, and particularly Dickerson's third quarter and
endurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael played 48 minutes,'' Tomjanovich said, ``and I think
he broke a sweat. I don't know. That guy is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams were tied or traded the lead 15 times when the Rockets
suddenly took off from a tie at 63. Mobley hit a pair of 3s around
an Olajuwon jumper and a Dickerson free throw, before Dickerson
swished consecutive treys on three trips down the court.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets made all eight attempts from beyond the 3-point arc
in the third quarter, and the 18-2 run from the last tie pushed
them to an 81-65 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets held on to their 16-point lead through the quarter.
And when Mobley hit two more 3s, they led by 16 again, 103-87, with
7:45 left.
</P>
<P>
   Turnovers _ the Rockets had eight in the last eight minutes _
and the relentless Raptors offense kept the Rockets from putting
away the win more neatly. But a pair of rookies had outshot the
Raptors in a shootout to head to the road on a roll, leaving behind
an eight-game home winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was unbelievable,'' Carter said. ``I told them they had
to stop doing that. `You guys can miss one.' That was just sick.
They couldn't miss. I'm proud of them because they are part of the
rookie class.''
</P>
<P>
   At least for Thursday, even with Carter at his best, Dickerson
and Mobley jumped to the head of the class.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Hakeem Olajuwon is certain he will be vindicated when the NBA
reviews the tape of the incident that led to his ejection from
Thursday's 113-104 victory over the Toronto Raptors at Compaq
Center.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Olajuwon was tossed by referee Joey Crawford with 2:55 remaining
in the third period for throwing an elbow toward the Raptors'
Charles Oakley. Olajuwon was given a level 2 flagrant foul, which
means he could be suspended for Saturday's game at Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets do not expect Olajuwon to be suspended, though,
since such a penalty is up to the league's discretion.
</P>
<P>
   And since videotape replays seemed to validate Olajuwon's claim
that he was retaliating for flagrant elbows thrown by Oakley just
seconds before, it is expected that the league will permit Olajuwon
to play Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see on the film what he did,'' Olajuwon said. ``It was
totally unexpected. I was going for a rebound, and he wasn't even
trying to go for a rebound. He was trying to knock me out. That was
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, that play was terrible. That was totally unncessary. I
can understand if he was trying to make a play, but he wasn't. When
you have a player trying to hurt another in the flow of the game,
well, that's terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley begged to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch the replay,'' Oakley said. ``He (Olajuwon) was running
in there. I was just trying to block him out and follow the
basketball. Things happen on the court every night. I wasn't trying
to take him out of the air or anything. Look, I'm not going to back
down just because he wants to complain.''
</P>
<P>
   The play began when Othella Harrington missed a baseline hook.
Olajuwon went up for the rebound, but Oakley turned and threw a
pair of elbows to Olajuwon's chest, as if he were doing a bit of
downfield blocking.
</P>
<P>
   As Olajuwon fell to the floor, Oakley threw another elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon staggered to his feet, caught up with Oakley and threw
an elbow of his own, which Crawford saw.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon called Oakley's play ``evil,'' saying the league should
do something to curtail his wild elbows and dirty play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand when you see somebody who is dirty,''
Olajuwon said. ``The intention, that was evil. He was trying to
hurt another player. That is totally unnecessary. I was trying to
find an excuse for why he did that. You can play physical, but to
try and injure somebody was totally beneath the professional level.
The NBA should definitely do something about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just that he's dirty. His heart is dirty. He is not
clean from the inside. To look at another man and try to injure
him, that is totally unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon did not apologize for attempting to get back at Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was retaliation,'' Olajuwon said. ``But what he did was
unnecessary. I was surprised at the intent of what he was trying to
do. There's a difference between somebody playing physical and
somebody trying to hurt somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that he hit me; it's that he put the elbow right in
my chest. That is a big difference _ that's not somebody trying to
just hit somebody; he was trying to hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was he surprised that the officials missed Oakley's
incident-sparking play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the nature of the game,'' Olajuwon said. ``When you
react, you see the second one. They never see the first one. I'm
very happy that they were able to catch it on the film. So it is
very clear what he did, and the NBA will see. It will speak for
itself.''

   Hotel bellman: ``I'll give you 2-1 odds and the other three
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   So, why wait for the games? Can we all go home now?
</P>
<P>
   This looks more and more like one of those old Columbo episodes,
where we saw who did it and how they did it before the first
commercial, then spent the rest of the show watching Peter Falk
work the story backward.
</P>
<P>
   But as Columbo would say, just one more thing.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State, Connecticut and Ohio State are more than just
long, long shots. They are three pretty good stories, and there are
reasons to root for each.
</P>
<P>
   How can you not pull for the Buckeyes, 8-22 and last in the Big
Ten just a year ago and now flying in as the most improbable Final
Four guest in years? Did they even bother to use a plane?
</P>
<P>
   How can you not pull for the Huskies, who have been one of the
top teams in college basketball for the past decade and yet been
derided by some for never taking the last giant step in the Big
Dance?
</P>
<P>
   How can you not pull for the Spartans, who in the 20th
anniversary season of Magic Johnson leading Michigan State to its
only NCAA title are riding on the shoulders of four tough kids from
the tough streets of Flint, Mich.?
</P>
<P>
   If patience is indeed a virtue, then all three of these teams
are practically saints. It has been 31 years since Ohio State last
made it to the Final Four. Two decades have passed since the kid
with the Magic smile led the Spartans past Larry Bird and Indiana
State in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   And for Connecticut, this has been the most grueling trip by a
team of Huskies this side of the Iditarod to finally make the
school's first appearance in the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   And the reward for all three? Duke.
</P>
<P>
   It is the tale of three coaches who have overcome tragedy and
persevered and taken the long climb up the ladder.
</P>
<P>
   What a priceless image Saturday when Ohio State completed its
wild ride to the Final Four and coach Jim O'Brien stood at midcourt
hugging his two daughters. O'Brien was married to his college
sweetheart but lost her to a heart attack in 1991, and here was a
portrait of two girls who had such pride in their father for
keeping their lives on track.
</P>
<P>
   What a hoot to see UConn's Jim Calhoun cut loose and dance a jig
on the sidelines as his team wrapped up its Final Four berth. Tiny
Gonzaga wore the label as the Cinderella team, but Calhoun and his
Huskies always have been outside with their noses pressed against
the glass during the ball.
</P>
<P>
   What an unusual team coach Tom Izzo put together at Michigan
State, mining the talent in the blue-collar city of Flint and
getting a group of former high school rivals to bond.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo, the son of a shoe repairman, began working in the same
business when he was 12 years old and knows all about labor and
family. That's why he had his first recruit, Antonio Smith, climb
the ladder with him to cut down his piece of the net when the
Spartans won the Midwest Regional.
</P>
<P>
   In any other season, the spotlight would shine brightly on the
magical run of one of these teams to the championship, which is a
story line the NCAA Tournament, more than any of our other major
sports events, seems to serve up so consistently.
</P>
<P>
   The man selling souvenir T-shirts on the corner says it's a
lopsided market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might be the first time we have to discount the ones from
the other schools before they play the game,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The waitress sets the plate of buffalo wings on the table and
says: ``They're tasty, they're hot. Like Duke.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody else is bleu cheese dressing.

KINGS' PLAYOFF HOPES GROW DIMMER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ It was a night when the Kings desperately needed to
alter history and desperately needed to upend a nemesis that
quietly, calmly goes about its business.
</P>
<P>
   But some things obviously aren't meant to be for this team this
season. And some things don't seem meant to be for this team in any
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (27-39-5) took another big step away from this
season's playoffs with a 2-1 loss Thursday night to the Dallas
Stars before a crowd of 14,888 at the Forum. Third-period shots by
Rob Blake and Sandy Moger hit the crossbar and the right goal post,
respectively, seeming to symbolize the frustration and futility of
the Kings' efforts this season.
</P>
<P>
   And who knows when the Kings ever again will manage to defeat
the Stars? The streak now stands at an astonishing 17 games without
a victory against Dallas, an 0-11-6 litany of winlessness that
dates to the coaching reign of Barry Melrose.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are 0-5 against Dallas this season, all one-goal
losses, with one meeting remaining. The Stars (45-14-12) didn't
dominate and didn't outplay the Kings, but displayed a composure
that explained as well as anything else why they will finish the
regular season with the best record in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   It was another game where the Kings could justly feel they
deserved better than the outcome they got, a fact that provides
little solace at this point in their faltering bid for a playoff
berth.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the numbers: The Kings trail Calgary, which holds the
eighth and final Western Conference playoff berth, by eight points.
They trail ninth-place Edmonton by four points. They have 11 games
remaining, eight of those on the road. In other words, any playoff
hopes the Kings still have are purely mathematical.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings opened the game with a strong shift by the line of
Olli Jokinen, Craig Johnson and Donald Audette, a shift that set
the tone for how the Kings would play, but also for the strong
effort by Dallas goalie Roman Turek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we came out and did exactly what we wanted to do,''
defenseman Garry Galley said. ``We wanted to play in their end and
get the puck deep in their end and get our forecheck going and get
some chances at the net, which we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Turek at the other end, Stephane Fiset was sharp in the
Kings' goal, especially when he had to stop successive point-blank
shots by Derian Hatcher during a frenetic shift by Dallas midway
through the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was the Stars who scored the only goal of the opening
period, Benoit Hogue beating Fiset from the left faceoff circle
less than a minute after Glen Murray had missed an open net at the
other end of the ice for the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings evened the score five minutes into the second period,
finally solving Turek when Luc Robitaille scored from the slot
after Ray Ferraro had stolen the puck from Dallas defenseman Sergei
Zubov along the right boards.
</P>
<P>
   Invigorated by the goal, the Kings almost got another one less
than two minutes later, but Jokinen was unable to get the puck past
Turek from point-blank range at 6:27.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the difference between the Kings and Stars became clear.
When the Kings got a chance, they couldn't capitalize. When the
Stars got a chance, they took advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The chance came at 10:34. Philippe Boucher lost the puck to Mike
Modano, who passed to Brett Hull in the left circle. Hull
effortlessly snapped the puck over Fiset's left shoulder, and in
one weak moment, the Kings had a one-goal deficit for all their
earnest efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good hockey team we are playing,'' Galley said,
``and we can't afford to have even little letdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had their chances in the third period (including the
crossbar and post), but were unable to get the tying goal.

EUROPEAN UNION REACHES BUDGET ACCORD AFTER INTENSE DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs throughout with accord and other Friday developments)   (bl)  
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Leaders of the European Union on Friday reached a
last-ditch accord on a reform of the 15-nation bloc's
$92-billion-dollar annual budget that would eventually make it
possible for Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to join.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement only came after a bitter conflict that took the
summit meeting into the early hours of Friday, more than 18 hours
past its scheduled conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Protracted arguments had pitted northern nations, which tend to
be the main contributors to the budget, against southern states,
which are its main beneficiaries. But German arguments that a
failure would paralyze the European Union at a time when a show of
unity was critical eventually prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the states in the Union are also members of NATO and
engaged in the alliance's bombardment of Yugoslavia. To have seemed
divided at this juncture would have been devastating, German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder argued.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout more than two days of talks, Germany, whose net
annual contribution of about $12 billion is by far the union's
largest, appeared determined to complete negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer described the talks as
``extremely difficult,'' because they involved ``large amounts of
money and legitimate national interests.''
</P>
<P>
   But having worked tirelessly on the budget issue over the past
10 days, Schroeder seemed unwilling to abandon an effort Germany
saw as necessary to cement the unity of Europe. After a shaky first
six months in office, the German Chancellor was also in acute need
of a conspicuous diplomatic success.
</P>
<P>
   Its came early Friday, when the 15 heads of state and government
agreed that the overall budget for 2000 through 2006 would not be
allowed to grow by more than inflation from its 1999 level of $92
billion, halting a relentless upward trend.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that although Germany compromised on reductions
in farm spending _ scaling back a proposal to cut payments for
cereals by 20 in three stages to 15 percent in two stages and
delaying reductions in payments for dairy products until 2005 _
most cuts were elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The chief stumbling blocks to an accord on the so-called
``Agenda 2000'' program were French resistance to reforms of a
European agricultural policy that benefits its more than one
million farmers, Spanish objections to cuts in a regional fund that
provides European Union money to poorer countries, and objections
from several delegations to a rebate Britain receives that is worth
over $3 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Farm spending, designed to shield the farmers from lower world
market prices, accounts for about half of the European Union
budget. Germany, with a relatively small farm sector and a
conviction that spending would increase rapidly with new members,
has insisted that farm spending be stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   Spain also spent many hours resisting reform, both in the farm
sector and in the various forms of regional aid that go to poorer
European countries. This aid accounts for close to a third of the
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spain will not accept any cuts from the level of funding it
now receives,'' said Spanish Finance Minister Rodrigo de Rato a few
hours before the agreement was reached. Greek Minister Costas
Simitis also objected to any change. ``Our per-capital income is 20
percent below the European average,'' he said. ``You can't say we
do not need help any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Several countries focused on the more than $3 billion that
Britain has received each year since 1984. The payment, negotiated
by then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, represents about 60
percent of the difference between its contributions and the amount
Britain receives in Union spending. But the rebate was preserved.
</P>
<P>
   During the negotiations, the leaders came under scathing
criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said
they were about ``dictate to Israel the results of the negotiations
with the Palestinians by supporting a Palestinian state.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's outburst was apparently based on a draft of a
statement the leaders intend to make on the situation in the Middle
East, which would refer explicitly to a Palestinian right to a
state and say that, while this state should emerge from
negotiation, Israel had no right to veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Such wording, if approved, would go beyond any previous official
European positions about Palestinian statehood. As the European
meeting broke up, it was still not clear what the precise wording
of any statement on the Middle East would be.

CATCHY SHOW BY BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It had all the earmarks of a potential disaster. The
Bruins were coming off a monumental high after beating the Eastern
Conference-leading Senators in Ottawa, 3-0, Wednesday. They were
playing on consecutive nights against a Chicago Blackhawks team
with nothing to lose, and Boston was without its leading scorer,
Dmitri Khristich, out with a shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like trouble with a capital T.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who trailed, 2-0, midway through the second period,
managed to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and cashed in on
three power-play goals to wind up with a 3-3 tie Thursday &UR;  &LR; night at
the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out a little flat but we fought back,'' said coach Pat
Burns. ``One bad penalty and the puck was in the net but we picked
up a point. Three out of four points in 48 hours I don't find too
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Heinze, who is like the prize in the Cracker Jack box in
that you never know what you're going to get, scored a pair of
goals on the man advantage. Ray Bourque pulled to within a goal of
tying Paul Coffey for most career goals by a defenseman (385) with
a third-period strike, also on the power play, to provide the
Boston offense.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is unbeaten in its last five games (3-0-2) and is six
points ahead of the Rangers and seven points ahead of Florida for
the final Eastern Conference playoff spot with 11 games remaining.
More importantly, the Bruins have pulled to within two points of
idle Buffalo for seventh place, though the Sabres have a game in
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Bob Probert, known more for his fists than his touch
around the net, put the Blackhawks ahead at the 16:06 mark of the
first period. The Bruins were all over Chicago in the second, but
it took a little while for them to be rewarded. Just 39 seconds in,
Bourque rattled a shot from the right point off the post. P.J.
Axelsson forced Jocelyn Thibault to make a tough glove save at
5:42.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:25, Heinze did everything but score as he tried jamming the
puck past the goalie at the left post. Only 12 seconds later, the
Blackhawks made it a two-goal lead. Right wing Tony Amonte of
Hingham, among the only proven talent Chicago didn't deal before
Tuesday's trade deadline, took a pass from left wing Dean McAmmond
and sprinted up the ice. He teed up a slapper from the left circle
that sailed past Dafoe at 7:37, Amonte's 37th goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins got a bit of a boost from Ken Belanger, who went toe
to toe with Probert and clearly won.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny did a good job,'' said Burns. ``He woke 'em up for sure.
We needed something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinze, who has seven goals in seven games, then went to work,
cashing in on two penalties drawn by Anson Carter. His first came
at 11:13 off a perfect feed from defenseman Kyle McLaren. McLaren,
at the left point, took a pass from Bourque and dished it down to
Heinze, who redirected it past Thibault to pull the Bruins to
within 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight was Johnny on the spot,'' said Heinze. ``It was right
place at the right time. Kyle made an unbelievable play. He said he
even saw me and passed to me. It wasn't a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaren figured in on the next Heinze goal, too, scored with
48.5 seconds left in the period. McLaren put the puck on net from
the point and center Joe Thornton tried to tip it past Thibault.
The puck bounced out to Heinze, who popped in the rebound to make
it 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Brad Brown was assessed a penalty at the end of the
second period that led to the go-ahead goal at 1:21 of the third.
Center Tim Taylor set up Bourque by winning the draw in the right
circle. Bourque, at the right point, launched a shot that Thibault
couldn't stop.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were in good shape but not good enough. Defenseman
Boris Mironov, taking advantage of a Carter penalty, pulled the
Blackhawks even with a power-play goal with only 1:24 left in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played us tough,'' said Carter. ``We were able to bounce
back from a two-goal deficit. We weren't able to pull it out down
the stretch but I think we're happy with the point.''

 By LINDA MARX 
 &HT;    (Linda Marx is a Florida-based columnist and talk-radio
commentator.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    When I was a little girl growing up in Indiana where Jews were
few and far between, Passover meant family and tradition.
 &HT;    Both sets of grandparents and assorted relatives from around the
state would gather in our home for a festive Seder dinner. Each
spring it inaugurated the eight-day holiday when we ate no leavened
bread.
 &HT;    Some years I can remember as many as 30 people would join our
family's elaborate Passover celebration which often produced three
dining tables. Several of my older cousins took part in the lengthy
service which, from the reading of the Haggadah _ the story of the
deliverance from Egypt _ was hosted by members of my family.
 &HT;    Grandpa Dave, who had been a Cantor, always reminded us that
Passover's symbols tell the story of a God who freed slaves from
Egypt, made them his people, and called them to Israel more than
3,000 years ago.
 &HT;    Even though Passover is not an historical event that we
remember, my Grandma Bess explained that Judaism invites us to
become part of our own fascinating history. ``Seder is a wonderful
tool that links us with our past,'' she used to say. ``When we sit
down to celebrate Passover, we are at the Exodus.''
 &HT;    I still have fond memories of my mother's specially made goodies
like gefilte fish, horseradish, Haroset (apples, nuts, wine and
cinnamon), potato kugel and potato latkas, matzo ball soup,
brisket, roasted chicken, carrot tzimmes, coconut and chocolate
macaroons, sponge cake, and almond and honey cakes.
 &HT;    The adults drank Kosher Wine while we enjoyed glass after glass
of cold grape juice. Each goblet, by tradition, was filled then
partially emptied to recall the suffering of others.
 &HT;    Childhood Passover is something that became part of me and part
of who I am as an adult. As a Jew, everything I do and everything I
think at this time of the year goes back to my family and the
religious traditions they instilled in me.
 &HT;    Like the preparations always made for a visit by the prophet
Elijah who was supposed to join the head table, bringing the family
good news. I was the one who usually created his place setting with
my Grandma Irma's Rosenthal Classic Rose pattern China and mom's
Reed &AMP; Barton Francis I silver goblet and flatware. I also opened
the front door expecting Elijah to arrive. But he never did.
 &HT;    To start things off, we dipped a vegetable in salt water and ate
it combined with unleavened matzo, the ultimate symbol of the
holiday, and horseradish, also called maror.
 &HT;    We discussed the meaning of each tradition. Unleavened matzo
symbolized the fact that there was no time to allow bread to rise
in the haste to leave slavery, cross the Red Sea and enter the land
of Canaan. Salt water was tasted to evoke tears; horseradish
recalled the bitterness of bondage.
 &HT;    As children, we took turns asking the Four Questions which began
with the familiar words, ``Why is this night different from all
others?'' I remember Grandpa Louis teasing us with a great line he
may have borrowed from a Jewish comedian: ``How many Jews ask only
FOUR questions?''
 &HT;    I never knew who hid the Afikomen (money in an envelope) in our
home. One of my cousins always found it before my brother and I had
a chance to search. We rationalized our never receiving the prize
by telling each other it was better to give then to receive.
 &HT;    But all of that joy and happiness became something different
when my parents died _ Mom eight years ago; Dad last May. In my
case, I learned more about my religion and its traditions from them
than from all of the studies I endured during a decade of Sunday
School classes.
 &HT;    For most of the years since my mother's death, we were invited
to the homes of friends for Seder dinner. Their family celebrations
were lovely ... yet lonely. I felt like an outsider on my own
holiday.
 &HT;    So last year, ironically my dad's last Passover, I hosted Seder
dinner in our Florida home for him, my brother, his wife and niece,
my Episcopalian husband, my oldest girlfriend from Indiana, other
friends, a childless couple from the area, and, of course, our Jack
Russell terrier who loves table scraps.
 &HT;    I worried about making matzo ball dumplings that would turn out
moist and flavorful so the soup would taste right. I sweated over a
hot stove in hopes that my roasted chicken would be tender and
juicy.
 &HT;    I devoured an old Jewish cookbook that my mother gave me years
ago to try and recreate the culinary wonders she could pull out of
her father's yarmulke. And yes, I ordered some of the side dishes
from gourmet caterers with desserts courtesy of Wolfie's Bakery in
Miami Beach. (Tradition never tasted so good!)
 &HT;    Although we had a good time, the evening seemed quite different
from that which I remember as a child. With grandparents gone and
cousins living too far to visit, Passover began to take on a new
meaning for me. I used many of my mother's traditional treasures
like Kiddush cups, Seder plates, matzo covers, child's Passover
book, Haggadah and Afikomen prize.
 &HT;    Yet most of my family members were replaced by friends. There
was less emphasis on the traditional service with more conversation
about current events than historic memories. Kosher wine was
replaced by Cabernet Sauvignon. People only nibbled on fatty foods
like chopped liver and gefilte fish rather than indulge every bite
from the nine-course meal.
 &HT;    This year will be tougher still with both parents gone. No
matter how much I love my newer family and friends _ especially the
laughs and lingering _ holiday traditions can never stay the same.
 &HT;    Mom used to call the grocer by his first name; I'm make my own
way to the unpersonal service of the bustling neighborhood super
market. While my parents put their children's needs ahead of
theirs, friends today seem more self-centered, constantly searching
for spiritual enrichment. The Seder service itself creates less
interest than what is on television.
 &HT;    Such is life. These changes remind me of a song we sang each
summer at Jewish camp, a song that provides me with solace:
 &HT;    Days pass and years go bye, ever and ever ...
 &HT;    and as our voices ring,
 &HT;    ring out with songs we sing,
 &HT;    life is a joyous thing,
 &HT;    ever and ever.
 &HT;

 &HT;    
 &HT;    When I was a little girl growing up in Indiana where Jews were
few and far between, Passover meant family and tradition.
 &HT;    Both sets of grandparents and assorted relatives from around the
state would gather in our home for a festive Seder dinner. Each
spring it inaugurated the eight-day holiday when we ate no leavened
bread.
 &HT;    Some years I can remember as many as 30 people would join our
family's elaborate Passover celebration which often produced three
dining tables. Several of my older cousins took part in the lengthy
service which, from the reading of the Haggadah _ the story of the
deliverance from Egypt _ was hosted by members of my family.
 &HT;    Grandpa Dave, who had been a Cantor, always reminded us that
Passover's symbols tell the story of a God who freed slaves from
Egypt, made them his people, and called them to Israel more than
3,000 years ago.
 &HT;    Even though Passover is not an historical event that we
remember, my Grandma Bess explained that Judaism invites us to
become part of our own fascinating history. ``Seder is a wonderful
tool that links us with our past,'' she used to say. ``When we sit
down to celebrate Passover, we are at the Exodus.''
 &HT;    I still have fond memories of my mother's specially made goodies
like gefilte fish, horseradish, Haroset (apples, nuts, wine and
cinnamon), potato kugel and potato latkas, matzo ball soup,
brisket, roasted chicken, carrot tzimmes, coconut and chocolate
macaroons, sponge cake, and almond and honey cakes.
 &HT;    The adults drank Kosher Wine while we enjoyed glass after glass
of cold grape juice. Each goblet, by tradition, was filled then
partially emptied to recall the suffering of others.
 &HT;    Childhood Passover is something that became part of me and part
of who I am as an adult. As a Jew, everything I do and everything I
think at this time of the year goes back to my family and the
religious traditions they instilled in me.
 &HT;    Like the preparations always made for a visit by the prophet
Elijah who was supposed to join the head table, bringing the family
good news. I was the one who usually created his place setting with
my Grandma Irma's Rosenthal Classic Rose pattern China and mom's
Reed &AMP; Barton Francis I silver goblet and flatware. I also opened
the front door expecting Elijah to arrive. But he never did.
 &HT;    To start things off, we dipped a vegetable in salt water and ate
it combined with unleavened matzo, the ultimate symbol of the
holiday, and horseradish, also called maror.
 &HT;    We discussed the meaning of each tradition. Unleavened matzo
symbolized the fact that there was no time to allow bread to rise
in the haste to leave slavery, cross the Red Sea and enter the land
of Canaan. Salt water was tasted to evoke tears; horseradish
recalled the bitterness of bondage.
 &HT;    As children, we took turns asking the Four Questions which began
with the familiar words, ``Why is this night different from all
others?'' I remember Grandpa Louis teasing us with a great line he
may have borrowed from a Jewish comedian: ``How many Jews ask only
FOUR questions?''
 &HT;    I never knew who hid the Afikomen (money in an envelope) in our
home. One of my cousins always found it before my brother and I had
a chance to search. We rationalized our never receiving the prize
by telling each other it was better to give then to receive.
 &HT;    But all of that joy and happiness became something different
when my parents died _ Mom eight years ago; Dad last May. In my
case, I learned more about my religion and its traditions from them
than from all of the studies I endured during a decade of Sunday
School classes.
 &HT;    For most of the years since my mother's death, we were invited
to the homes of friends for Seder dinner. Their family celebrations
were lovely ... yet lonely. I felt like an outsider on my own
holiday.
 &HT;    So last year, ironically my dad's last Passover, I hosted Seder
dinner in our Florida home for him, my brother, his wife and niece,
my Episcopalian husband, my oldest girlfriend from Indiana, other
friends, a childless couple from the area, and, of course, our Jack
Russell terrier who loves table scraps.
 &HT;    I worried about making matzo ball dumplings that would turn out
moist and flavorful so the soup would taste right. I sweated over a
hot stove in hopes that my roasted chicken would be tender and
juicy.
 &HT;    I devoured an old Jewish cookbook that my mother gave me years
ago to try and recreate the culinary wonders she could pull out of
her father's yarmulke. And yes, I ordered some of the side dishes
from gourmet caterers with desserts courtesy of Wolfie's Bakery in
Miami Beach. (Tradition never tasted so good!)
 &HT;    Although we had a good time, the evening seemed quite different
from that which I remember as a child. With grandparents gone and
cousins living too far to visit, Passover began to take on a new
meaning for me. I used many of my mother's traditional treasures
like Kiddush cups, Seder plates, matzo covers, child's Passover
book, Haggadah and Afikomen prize.
 &HT;    Yet most of my family members were replaced by friends. There
was less emphasis on the traditional service with more conversation
about current events than historic memories. Kosher wine was
replaced by Cabernet Sauvignon. People only nibbled on fatty foods
like chopped liver and gefilte fish rather than indulge every bite
from the nine-course meal.
 &HT;    This year will be tougher still with both parents gone. No
matter how much I love my newer family and friends _ especially the
laughs and lingering _ holiday traditions can never stay the same.
 &HT;    Mom used to call the grocer by his first name; I'm make my own
way to the unpersonal service of the bustling neighborhood super
market. While my parents put their children's needs ahead of
theirs, friends today seem more self-centered, constantly searching
for spiritual enrichment. The Seder service itself creates less
interest than what is on television.
 &HT;    Such is life. These changes remind me of a song we sang each
summer at Jewish camp, a song that provides me with solace:
 &HT;    Days pass and years go bye, ever and ever ...
 &HT;    and as our voices ring,
 &HT;    ring out with songs we sing,
 &HT;    life is a joyous thing,
 &HT;    ever and ever.

 &HT;    WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Last year alone, I drove at least 30,000
miles statewide, from the once-bustling village of Flamingo in the
Everglades to the tiny burg of Walnut Hill in the western
Panhandle. The environmental devastation I witnessed _
deforestation, unnecessary forest fires, dredging, backfilling,
excavating, paving and the spreading of herbicides _ makes me want
to chase the perpetrators into the sea or, at the very least, force
them into Alabama and Georgia.
 &HT;    As the Florida Legislature prepares to go into annual session,
natives like me want our new governor, Jeb Bush, a wealthy
developer from Texas, to know that our peninsula is a special place
and that the wholesale raping of our pristine treasures _ some of
the most magnificent flora and fauna anywhere in the world _ has to
end.
 &HT;    In case no one except natives have noticed, our paradise has
become a victim of its own allure as tens of thousands of people a
year make Florida their permanent home and as millions of others
visit our beaches, amusement parks and other entertainment venues.
 &HT;    ``The tale of Florida's development is often sordid, marked by
the greed of people intent on taking whatever the land offered and
leaving nothing in return,'' writes Mark Derr in his book, ``Some
Kind of Paradise: A Chronicle of Man and the Land in Florida.''
 &HT;    Few contemporary trends illustrate Derr's observation more than
the coast-to-coast destruction of our cypress trees. Although these
trees symbolize Florida almost as much as alligators and oranges,
their disappearance, unlike that of mangrove trees, has gone
virtually unreported. As a result, no important citizen protest has
emerged to send a warning to elected officials.
 &HT;    Exactly how important are cypress trees to the long-term health
of Florida, the state with the most beautiful name? Second only to
pines in sheer numbers, cypress occupy 1.6-million wetland acres
and are essential for water purification, flood control and as
habitat for wildlife.
 &HT;    Some cypress stands, especially those in the swamps, ponds and
backwaters here in the southern region, are being wiped out to make
room for housing developments and new municipalities, such as
Abacoa, a Truman Show-type city being constructed near the
Loxahatchee River in Palm Beach County. When completed, Abacoa will
consume 2,055 acres.
 &HT;    Even though cypress stands here are being destroyed to make way
for buildings, most trees statewide are being cut for mulch. That
is right: Our cypress trees are being reduced to mulch for flower
beds. For many homeowners, in fact, cypress mulch is a
horticultural must. According to a report by the University of
Florida School of Forest Resources and Conservation, most of the
old-growth _ some the mammoth trees hundreds of years old _ was
harvested before the 1950s and was used to manufacture furniture,
shingles, paneling, beehives and water tanks.
 &HT;    Today, however, 85 percent of the trees are bagged as mulch. In
assessing the extent of the devastation, a federal study shows that
cypress harvesting has increased from about 19-million cubic feet
in 1980 to 42-million cubic feet in 1995, an amount that would fill
a 90-story bin the size of UF's Florida Field.
 &HT;    As if the uncontrolled harvesting is not bad enough, we are not
regenerating trees fast enough to make up for the losses. ``It
warrants an alert,'' said Judy Hancock of the Florida chapter of
the Sierra Club. ``There's just major devastation going on. You can
see it just rolling down the road.''
 &HT;    What are local and state officials doing to halt the
destruction? Hardly anything. State forestry bigwigs and timber
moguls are commissioning studies to determine the impact of
increased harvesting on wetland stands and to discover ways to
regenerate trees. Officials, wary of angering homeowners, hope that
the new studies will bring voluntary rules to harvesting.
 &HT;    The hard truth is that voluntary guidelines will not work in an
industry that has a trendy, lucrative product such as cypress
mulch. Mandatory guidelines are needed. And we need to use the best
science available to determine _ once and for all _ how fast
cypress stands regenerate and under what conditions. What level of
stress, for example, does heavy harvesting place on the general
ecology?
 &HT;    We do not have reliable answers because officials let the mulch
industry virtually regulate itself. Meanwhile, the Sunshine State
is losing trees that beautify our roadsides, nurture our wildlife
and help keep our ground water potable.
 &HT;    We are fools to let this continue. ``There are as many reasons
for moving to Florida as there are people,'' Derr writes, ``and the
problem becomes less one of controlling the influx than of assuring
that the state's prime resources are cared for and respected. ...
That can come about only if those officials and voters shaping the
state's destiny approach their responsibilities with a feel for the
land and water that transcends desire for quick profit.
 &HT;    ``Once used up and despoiled, it is paradise no more.''

stress, for example, does heavy harvesting place on the general
ecology?
 &HT;    We do not have reliable answers because officials let the mulch
industry virtually regulate itself. Meanwhile, the Sunshine State
is losing trees that beautify our roadsides, nurture our wildlife
and help keep our ground water potable.
 &HT;    We are fools to let this continue. ``There are as many reasons
for moving to Florida as there are people,'' Derr writes, ``and the
problem becomes less one of controlling the influx than of assuring
that the state's prime resources are cared for and respected. ...
That can come about only if those officials and voters shaping the
state's destiny approach their responsibilities with a feel for the
land and water that transcends desire for quick profit.
 &HT;    ``Once used up and despoiled, it is paradise no more.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Last month when the Rev. Jerry Falwell issued his Tinky Winky
``alert'' to parents, he wasn't the only Christian concerned about
a ``gay role model'' on television.
 &HT;    Martin Mawyer, president of the Christian Action Network, also
suggested that the Federal Communications Commission place a
warning label _ HC _ on TV shows that contain ``homosexual
content.''
 &HT;    The Christian Action network (CAN), a grassroots, ``pro-family''
organization, based in Virginia, claims to have 250,000 members.
 &HT;    ``Members of our organization have become increasingly disgusted
with the amount of homosexuality in television programming. More
than two dozen homosexual characters are portrayed weekly on
network television alone,'' Mawyer said in press statement.
 &HT;    ``Parents have a right to be warned about programs depicting
acts of homosexuality on television. TV broadcasters _ including
network, cable, and satellite _ already place warning labels on
programs containing violence, sex and `adult' language. Now it's
time to warn parents about homosexual sex,'' he said.
 &HT;    Mawyer and his organization are reacting _ perhaps overreacting
_ to the showing of a short film, ``Cowboy Jesus,'' which casts
Christ as a black lesbian, who has sex with Mary Magdalene. The
film ran on a public access cable station in Arlington, Virginia.
 &HT;    What also disturbs Mawyer and members of CAN is the 25 gay,
lesbian, bisexual, and transgender characters now airing in prime
time (as counted by the Gay &AMP; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation's
(GLAAD)).
 &HT;    GLAAD is a national lesbian and gay media advocacy organization.
 &HT;    Some of the characters are ``more flamboyant and disgusting than
others,'' CAN told the Washington Post, but all of them ``ridicule
the traditional morals of conservative Americans,'' the
organization contends.
 &HT;    Hollywood has thrown a cold shoulder to Mawyer's suggestion for
an HC warning label. Top lobbyist Jack Valenti, president and CEO
of the Motion Picture Association of America and head of the
Television Ratings Committee, says it is an ``inhumane proposal
that should be ignored.''
 &HT;    Joan M. Garry, executive director of GLAAD went further: ``The
notion of adding a distinct label for `homosexual content' is
clearly based on ignorance and prejudice. Such a label could only
serve to stigmatize members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and
transgender community by suggesting that something is inherently
wrong with them.''
 &HT;    The liberal People for the American Way, a progressive advocacy
organization, also weighed in on Mawyer's proposal. ``The sad fact
that groups on the fringe of American politics would seek to target
gay and lesbian TV characters in this manner points out how far we
have to go to achieve the American dream of justice,'' said Carole
Shields, the organization's president.
 &HT;    What's really going on with Falwell and Mawyer is a conservative
backlash against the progress that gays and lesbians have made in
Hollywood. Two years ago Ellen DeGeneres opened the closet door for
prime time gay and lesbian characters, and there has been an
increasingly positive portrayal of gay people on television. This
season, for example, Eric McCormick, who plays a lawyer and is the
gay male lead on ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' a show so successful that NBC is
moving it April 8 to the network's coveted ``Must See TV'' Thursday
lineup, at 8:30 p.m.
 &HT;    Another example is the Feb. 10 and 17 ground breaking episodes
of ``Dawson's Creek,'' which brought an openly gay teenager Jack
McPhee (Kerr Smith) of the fictitious Capeside High to prime time.
 &HT;    ```Dawson's Creek' stayed away from stereotypes on this one,''
said GLAAD entertainment media director Scott Seomin. ``Jack is a
strong character written with intelligence, depth, and integrity.
`Dawson's Creek' has added to the diversity of gay characters on
television with its positive portrayal of Jack,'' he added.
 &HT;    Keep in mind that the conservative call for a homosexual content
warning label _ modern day scarlet letters for television _ can't
be viewed in isolation. ``The religious right has a very long,
concentrated campaign against anything that will increase societal
tolerance and acceptance of homosexuality,'' said Peter Montgomery,
special assistant to the president of People for the American Way.
 &HT;    ``So when you say this one thing seems silly and ridiculous, you
must remember that the right is constantly putting out there the
message that gays are diseased, horrible, and don't deserve to be a
full part of the American community. Our speaking out was a matter
of challenging bigotry when it's outspoken and not letting things
go unanswered, especially when anti-gay bigotry leads to really
horrific crimes'' he said during a telephone interview.
 &HT;    There's no doubt about the horrific crimes and hostile climate
out there _ as the brutal murders of Matthew Shepard and Billy Jack
Gather serve to remind us.

 By AKILAH MONIFA 
 &HT;    (Akilah Monifa, African American, is a freelance writer living
in Oakland, Calif., and a contributor to the forthcoming book
``Seductions of Justice: Lesbian Legal Theories and Practices.''
(1999) Routledge Press.)
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Elia Kazan's honorary Academy Award was not the only controversy
at the 71st Academy Awards.
 &HT;    According to Chris Rock, a presenter, it ``looked like the
Million White Man March out there.'' Host Whoopi Goldberg chimed in
with ``I thought the black list was me and Hattie McDaniel.''
 &HT;    What both Rock and Goldberg were referring to was the lack of
nominations of black performers and filmmakers to the Academy
Awards. There was absolutely no chance that African Americans would
win any Oscars this year, because none was even nominated.
 &HT;    Years ago, Spike Lee called the Academy Awards racist. Last
year, in a film collage of previous Oscar Awards shows, the Academy
themselves showed a clip of Richard Pryor stating, ``I'm here to
explain tonight why no black people will be nominated for
anything.''
 &HT;    Also last year, the Academy gathered on stage the 73 winners of
acting awards in the past. There were only six African Americans on
that stage: Morgan Freeman, Lou Gossett Jr., Cuba Gooding Jr.,
Whoopi Goldberg, Sidney Poitier, and Denzel Washington. And owing
to the alphabetical alignment, three _ Goldberg, Gooding, and
Gossett _ were sitting next to each other. Five men and one woman.
Only one other woman of African descent has ever won a major award,
the late Hattie McDaniel.
 &HT;    So what are we to make at the dearth of African American
nominations?
 &HT;    African Americans comprise 25 percent of domestic box office
sales and an even larger percentage of key urban markets. And, as
in television _ where surveys that show what TV programs African
Americans are watching are entirely different from what polls
indicate as the top shows _ in film it's the same. Black filmgoers
see the big Hollywood hits as well as movies that African Americans
direct, produce, and star in _ films that will probably never
receive any Academy recognition.
 &HT;    Politics loomed large this year with the Kazan controversy and
last year in a much more subtle and largely ignored way.
 &HT;    At the Academy Awards in 1975, presenter Lillian Hellman chided
the industry for dealing with McCarthyism ``with the force and
courage of a bowl of mash potatoes.'' So I guess it was in fact
fitting that Kazan receive the Lifetime Achievement Award.
 &HT;    But Hollywood is rarely confused for being the bastion of
politics, ribbons of various colors aside. It just doesn't happen
that frequently. In the 71-year history of the Awards one can
probably count fewer than 10 overtly political statements. That is
if you don't count the streaker. Post-awards people were expressing
relief that no political statements were uttered in this show, the
longest Oscar ceremony on record.
 &HT;    Perhaps most failed to listen to the short, eloquent, quiet _
and yet political _ speech of Chris Tashima who won as a
co-producer for live action short film, ``Visas and Virtue.'' The
film, in which he also starred, was about Japanese diplomat Chiune
Sugihara, who while posted in Lithuania during World War II is
credited with saving the lives of thousands of Jews. Some call
Sugihara ``Japan's Oskar Schindler.'' Sugihara defied orders and
issued transit visas which saved lives.
 &HT;    And just what did Tashima say when accepting his Academy Award?
``I hope we can begin to embrace every race. Diversity is the
ingenue. She's the true American star. And she's ready for her
close-up,'' he said, keeping his discourse within the 20-seconds'
time limitation imposed by the show's producers.
 &HT;    If folks had been listening, they would have found Tashima very
political. And political in a subtle, not a knock-you-over-the-head
way. There was no hissing or other audible disapproval as there was
for Sasheen Littlefeather when she spoke on behalf of Marlon Brando
25 years ago. There was no voiced disapproval of the idea of
embracing diversity and of inclusion.
 &HT;    And certainly it did not elicit the same reaction as did Jesse
Jackson's protest in 1996 that the Oscars excluded people of color
from jobs and Academy Awards.
 &HT;    Last year, by my count, only four people of color were even
nominated for on-air awards. This year Tashima was the only one to
win an Oscar at the ceremonies, a show where cameras shamelessly
panned to someone of African descent in the audience when there was
a presenter of African descent.
 &HT;    African Americans and Latinos have in part dealt with their
exclusion from the Oscars. The NAACP Image Awards and the ALMA
(American Latino Media Arts, and Spanish for ``soul'') honor
filmmakers and performers who probably wouldn't be honored by the
Academy.
 &HT;    The concept of Affirmative Action seems to offend many people
and is rapidly being obliterated both on federal and state levels.
This, despite the lack of racial diversity in any facet of American
life. The concept of diversity, however, doesn't seem to have the
same negative connotations.

 &HT;    Elia Kazan's honorary Academy Award was not the only controversy
at the 71st Academy Awards.
 &HT;    According to Chris Rock, a presenter, it ``looked like the
Million White Man March out there.'' Host Whoopi Goldberg chimed in
with ``I thought the black list was me and Hattie McDaniel.''
 &HT;    What both Rock and Goldberg were referring to was the lack of
nominations of black performers and filmmakers to the Academy
Awards. There was absolutely no chance that African Americans would
win any Oscars this year, because none was even nominated.
 &HT;    Years ago, Spike Lee called the Academy Awards racist. Last
year, in a film collage of previous Oscar Awards shows, the Academy
themselves showed a clip of Richard Pryor stating, ``I'm here to
explain tonight why no black people will be nominated for
anything.''
 &HT;    Also last year, the Academy gathered on stage the 73 winners of
acting awards in the past. There were only six African Americans on
that stage: Morgan Freeman, Lou Gossett Jr., Cuba Gooding Jr.,
Whoopi Goldberg, Sidney Poitier, and Denzel Washington. And owing
to the alphabetical alignment, three _ Goldberg, Gooding, and
Gossett _ were sitting next to each other. Five men and one woman.
Only one other woman of African descent has ever won a major award,
the late Hattie McDaniel.
 &HT;    So what are we to make at the dearth of African American
nominations?
 &HT;    African Americans comprise 25 percent of domestic box office
sales and an even larger percentage of key urban markets. And, as
in television _ where surveys that show what TV programs African
Americans are watching are entirely different from what polls
indicate as the top shows _ in film it's the same. Black filmgoers
see the big Hollywood hits as well as movies that African Americans
direct, produce, and star in _ films that will probably never
receive any Academy recognition.
 &HT;    Politics loomed large this year with the Kazan controversy and
last year in a much more subtle and largely ignored way.
 &HT;    At the Academy Awards in 1975, presenter Lillian Hellman chided
the industry for dealing with McCarthyism ``with the force and
courage of a bowl of mash potatoes.'' So I guess it was in fact
fitting that Kazan receive the Lifetime Achievement Award.
 &HT;    But Hollywood is rarely confused for being the bastion of
politics, ribbons of various colors aside. It just doesn't happen
that frequently. In the 71-year history of the Awards one can
probably count fewer than 10 overtly political statements. That is
if you don't count the streaker. Post-awards people were expressing
relief that no political statements were uttered in this show, the
longest Oscar ceremony on record.
 &HT;    Perhaps most failed to listen to the short, eloquent, quiet _
and yet political _ speech of Chris Tashima who won as a
co-producer for live action short film, ``Visas and Virtue.'' The
film, in which he also starred, was about Japanese diplomat Chiune
Sugihara, who while posted in Lithuania during World War II is
credited with saving the lives of thousands of Jews. Some call
Sugihara ``Japan's Oskar Schindler.'' Sugihara defied orders and
issued transit visas which saved lives.
 &HT;    And just what did Tashima say when accepting his Academy Award?
``I hope we can begin to embrace every race. Diversity is the
ingenue. She's the true American star. And she's ready for her
close-up,'' he said, keeping his discourse within the 20-seconds'
time limitation imposed by the show's producers.
 &HT;    If folks had been listening, they would have found Tashima very
political. And political in a subtle, not a knock-you-over-the-head
way. There was no hissing or other audible disapproval as there was
for Sasheen Littlefeather when she spoke on behalf of Marlon Brando
25 years ago. There was no voiced disapproval of the idea of
embracing diversity and of inclusion.
 &HT;    And certainly it did not elicit the same reaction as did Jesse
Jackson's protest in 1996 that the Oscars excluded people of color
from jobs and Academy Awards.
 &HT;    Last year, by my count, only four people of color were even
nominated for on-air awards. This year Tashima was the only one to
win an Oscar at the ceremonies, a show where cameras shamelessly
panned to someone of African descent in the audience when there was
a presenter of African descent.
 &HT;    African Americans and Latinos have in part dealt with their
exclusion from the Oscars. The NAACP Image Awards and the ALMA
(American Latino Media Arts, and Spanish for ``soul'') honor
filmmakers and performers who probably wouldn't be honored by the
Academy.
 &HT;    The concept of Affirmative Action seems to offend many people
and is rapidly being obliterated both on federal and state levels.
This, despite the lack of racial diversity in any facet of American
life. The concept of diversity, however, doesn't seem to have the
same negative connotations.
 &HT;    No one wants to play semantic word games, but someone has to
speak out for inclusion and diversity, particularly in the harsh
reality of organizations and systems which are clearly
exclusionary. Tashima, in his eloquence and simplicity, has words
of import for every element of American society.
 &HT;    It is time for the entertainment industry as well as other
industries to step up to the plate and redress this inequity. For
diversity, as Tashima said, is the true American star.

 By YLEANA MARTINEZ 
 c. 1999 Hispanic magazine 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    It is the end of the 20th century. The stage is set for a very
modern clash of the titans. At stake is nothing less than world
domination of the electronic marketplace using high-tech computer
graphics as ammo and old-fashioned elbow grease as fuel.
 &HT;    The arena is a virtual bookstore frequented by spectators who
are coveted by the mighty opponents for their wallets, their
loyalty, and their repeat business. At this, the dawn of the
on-line revolution, which enterprise will win the hearts and minds
of these consumers?
 &HT;    A leading contender is the 35-year-old son of a Cuban immigrant,
Jeffrey P. Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com Inc. _ the upstart
Internet company that boasts 4.5 million customers in 160
countries.
 &HT;    Bezos stands alone against his prime adversary, the very well
financed Barnes &AMP; Noble Corp., a behemoth on the brutish playing
fields of bookselling.
 &HT;    The media have often made comparisons to David and Goliath. But
in this showdown, it's no longer easy to tell who is David and who
is Goliath.
 &HT;    Bezos concocted the right formula for on-line selling when he
chose books as the product to move. In less than four years, he has
risen from Wall Street wunderkind to become one of cyberdom's kings
of the world.
 &HT;    In 1994 Bezos quit his job as a hedge fund manager to stake a
claim on the wild frontier of Internet retailing, or ``e-tailing.''
He moved to Seattle and started his business in a rented garage
with loans from family, friends, investment bankers and venture
capitalists.
 &HT;    Since its debut on the World Wide Web in July 1995, Amazon.com
has become the model to watch _ and to envy. Soon after the site
appeared, chat group participants praised its availability of
product and user-friendly style. Paradoxically, in the nonhuman
realm of cyberspace, it is the very pedestrian experience of word
of mouth that Amazon executives regard as a major reason for its
success.
 &HT;    What Amazon also did early on was spend millions of dollars on
advertising in such publications as the New York Times Book Review.
It also invested in banner links that touted the site in the ``hot
corner'' of browsers. The huge amounts of money spent _ $6.1
million in 1996 _ stirred excitement in the business world and
evoked highly positive press. The advertising blitz helped the
company reap $16 million in revenue, much of which went into
refining the site.
 &HT;    Amazon's warp-speed expansion rattled the nation's largest
physical bookstore chain, Barnes &AMP; Noble (B&AMP;N), which, along with
Borders, controls almost 12 percent of the nation's total book
sales.
 &HT;    Amazon left B&AMP;N to eat its dust, but it didn't take long for the
brand-name company to strike back-hard. Last year, B&AMP;N acquired the
book distributor, Ingram Book Co., and formed a partnership with
German media conglomerate, Bertelsmann AG.
 &HT;    Bezos' response: ``Our advantage is that we know more about
e-commerce than anybody else. We've been doing it longer, and we've
already leveled the playing field.'' Currently, Amazon claims 85
percent of on-line book sales. In the overall book market, however,
the Internet accounts for only 3 percent of the activity.
 &HT;    Last fall, Amazon acquired two leading Internet companies and
entered the European e-market by opening sites in the United
Kingdom and Germany. In June 1998, the company added music sales to
its offerings, claiming to offer 10 times the CD selection of the
typical music store, with savings for customers of up to 40
percent. Within four months, Amazon became the leading on-line
music retailer, with sales of $14.4 million.
 &HT;    For the fourth quarter of 1998, Amazon said its sales rose to
about $250 million, almost quadruple what it reported at the end of
1997 ($66 million). Based on these figures, the company trumpeted
that in its three-and-a-half-year existence, it had achieved a
staggering $1 billion in annualized sales.
 &HT;    Holiday sales helped Amazon to rack up some astounding figures.
Between Nov. 17, 1998, the day it launched its video and gift
stores, and Dec. 31, Amazon logged 1 million new customers and
shipped more than 7.5 million items, which was more than the
company shipped the entire previous year. On one day during that
period, the company shipped products worth $6 million.
 &HT;    As would be expected, Amazon.com is a Wall Street darling,
having declared two three-for-one splits on its common stock in the
last three months. It has also seen its shares rise from $9 in May
1997 to a little over $163 as of Jan. 11, 1999.
 &HT;    All these breathtaking figures, however, have not yet translated
into a stronger bottom line for the bookseller. Music and video
sales traditionally have had very thin profit margins, and the
company remains unprofitable. At press time, no specifics on 1998
fourth-quarter losses had yet been released, but industry analysts
forecast a loss of about 56 cents a share.
 &HT;    In the past, Bezos has attributed losses to aggressive
advertising campaigns and internal investment strategies. ``This is
an investment phase for Amazon.com,'' He told the Seattle Times
last summer. ``We've been totally straightforward with everybody
from the beginning that that's our strategy, and a lot of people
believe in our strategy and some people don't. Reasonable people
could disagree.'' (Bezos and his wife, Mackenzie, own about 45
percent of the company.)
 &HT;    For all the attention, wealth, and notoriety that Amazon has
garnered, the young billionaire behind it all remains a fairly
inaccessible person. Several requests to interview Bezos by phone
or by e-mail for this article were denied. Questions sent via
e-mail to a publicity assistant were not all answered.
 &HT;    According to other reporters, Bezos has a slight frame, often
wears white shirts and khaki pants, and has thinning brown hair.
But what stands out in photographs of this technology tycoon is his
apparently warm smile, his smooth, tanned skin, and his big brown
eyes. Bezos certainly looks boyish, and with his youthful
countenance he brings a decidedly fresh, counterculture approach to
his working environment. He reportedly drives a Honda Accord to
work and still rents an apartment month-to-month in Belltown, a
downtown Seattle neighborhood.
 &HT;    According to his assistant, Kay Dangaard, Bezos was the eldest
of three children, born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to Mike and
Jackie Bezos. His father was a petroleum engineer; his mother, a
homemaker who hailed from Virginia. ``His father was just 15 when
he left Cuba, and has never returned,'' Dangaard said via e-mail.
 &HT;    The Bezos family grew up in Miami and Houston. Young Jeffrey
spent many summers on his grandfather's ranch in Cotulla, Texas,
learning the ways of the land and many unoffice-like skills such as
fixing windmills, driving bulldozers, laying water lines, building
fences, and castrating cattle.
 &HT;    All the while, he dreamed of a career as a physicist, and he
enrolled at Princeton University to pursue his goal. In his
sophomore year, Bezos switched tracks when he realized that his
talent was in computers. He graduated in 1986, summa cum laude, Phi
Beta Kappa, in electrical engineering and computer science.
 &HT;    In an extensive interview last fall with several staff members
of the Washington Post, Bezos discussed his next venture for Amazon
_ a shopping referral service to help his 4.5 million customers
discover new products for sale on the Web. One service already
provided to many repeat buyers is that, based on their choices, the
company compiles listings of offerings they might be interested in.
 &HT;    This is what Bezos considers a ``personalization tool'' that
will increase the number of return site visits and give Internet
retailing the human touch it so sorely lacks.
 &HT;    Although the Web customization process rankles privacy freaks,
Bezos told the Post that the service ``is like retreating to the
time when you have small-town merchants who got to know you, and
they could help you get the right products.''
 &HT;    Computers may be the muscle that moves Amazon.com, but the heart
of the business is in a warehouse located in South Seattle, across
from a pawnshop and a building housing a needle exchange program.
Another warehouse is located in Newcastle, Del., and a third is
slated to open later this year in Nevada.
 &HT;    Here you will find employees, mostly in their 20s, wearing
comfortable clothes and sensible shoes for walking the miles of
aisles to physically pick out books and CDs to fill orders.
Neckties are no-no's, but dogs are welcome to join their masters at
work.
 &HT;    Fortunately, not everyone involved in book commerce is waiting
with bated breath to see which of the cyber arch-enemies will
emerge victorious. Marina Tristan, assistant director at Arte
Publico Press, in Houston, says that on a personal level, on-line
book ordering will never match the pleasure of browsing through a
bookstore. ``You know what I mean,'' she says. ``Holding a book in
your hands, reading excerpts.''
 &HT;    Instead, the small press, which operates out of the University
of Houston, views Internet booksellers as an additional marketing
tool to advertise its catalog.
 &HT;    Tristan says small brick-and-mortar bookstores, which are the
major outlets for Arte Publico, are still reeling from the impact
of the dizzying changes in the industry in recent years.
Consolidations of major book chains, wholesalers, and distributors
have resulted in the closure of numerous independent bookstores
across the country. ``To tell you the truth, Amazon.com has not had
a huge impact on us,'' she says.
 &HT;    Not yet, maybe, but the consensus is that Amazon.com has indeed
had a great impact in certain areas, revolutionizing the Web as a
retail outlet. As it continues to grow, it should make book readers
out of still more unsuspecting surfers.

 c. 1999 Hispanic magazine 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    It is the end of the 20th century. The stage is set for a very
modern clash of the titans. At stake is nothing less than world
domination of the electronic marketplace using high-tech computer
graphics as ammo and old-fashioned elbow grease as fuel.
 &HT;    The arena is a virtual bookstore frequented by spectators who
are coveted by the mighty opponents for their wallets, their
loyalty, and their repeat business. At this, the dawn of the
on-line revolution, which enterprise will win the hearts and minds
of these consumers?
 &HT;    A leading contender is the 35-year-old son of a Cuban immigrant,
Jeffrey P. Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com Inc. _ the upstart
Internet company that boasts 4.5 million customers in 160
countries.
 &HT;    Bezos stands alone against his prime adversary, the very well
financed Barnes &AMP; Noble Corp., a behemoth on the brutish playing
fields of bookselling.
 &HT;    The media have often made comparisons to David and Goliath. But
in this showdown, it's no longer easy to tell who is David and who
is Goliath.
 &HT;    Bezos concocted the right formula for on-line selling when he
chose books as the product to move. In less than four years, he has
risen from Wall Street wunderkind to become one of cyberdom's kings
of the world.
 &HT;    In 1994 Bezos quit his job as a hedge fund manager to stake a
claim on the wild frontier of Internet retailing, or ``e-tailing.''
He moved to Seattle and started his business in a rented garage
with loans from family, friends, investment bankers and venture
capitalists.
 &HT;    Since its debut on the World Wide Web in July 1995, Amazon.com
has become the model to watch _ and to envy. Soon after the site
appeared, chat group participants praised its availability of
product and user-friendly style. Paradoxically, in the nonhuman
realm of cyberspace, it is the very pedestrian experience of word
of mouth that Amazon executives regard as a major reason for its
success.
 &HT;    What Amazon also did early on was spend millions of dollars on
advertising in such publications as the New York Times Book Review.
It also invested in banner links that touted the site in the ``hot
corner'' of browsers. The huge amounts of money spent _ $6.1
million in 1996 _ stirred excitement in the business world and
evoked highly positive press. The advertising blitz helped the
company reap $16 million in revenue, much of which went into
refining the site.
 &HT;    Amazon's warp-speed expansion rattled the nation's largest
physical bookstore chain, Barnes &AMP; Noble (B&AMP;N), which, along with
Borders, controls almost 12 percent of the nation's total book
sales.
 &HT;    Amazon left B&AMP;N to eat its dust, but it didn't take long for the
brand-name company to strike back-hard. Last year, B&AMP;N acquired the
book distributor, Ingram Book Co., and formed a partnership with
German media conglomerate, Bertelsmann AG.
 &HT;    Bezos' response: ``Our advantage is that we know more about
e-commerce than anybody else. We've been doing it longer, and we've
already leveled the playing field.'' Currently, Amazon claims 85
percent of on-line book sales. In the overall book market, however,
the Internet accounts for only 3 percent of the activity.
 &HT;    Last fall, Amazon acquired two leading Internet companies and
entered the European e-market by opening sites in the United
Kingdom and Germany. In June 1998, the company added music sales to
its offerings, claiming to offer 10 times the CD selection of the
typical music store, with savings for customers of up to 40
percent. Within four months, Amazon became the leading on-line
music retailer, with sales of $14.4 million.
 &HT;    For the fourth quarter of 1998, Amazon said its sales rose to
about $250 million, almost quadruple what it reported at the end of
1997 ($66 million). Based on these figures, the company trumpeted
that in its three-and-a-half-year existence, it had achieved a
staggering $1 billion in annualized sales.
 &HT;    Holiday sales helped Amazon to rack up some astounding figures.
Between Nov. 17, 1998, the day it launched its video and gift
stores, and Dec. 31, Amazon logged 1 million new customers and
shipped more than 7.5 million items, which was more than the
company shipped the entire previous year. On one day during that
period, the company shipped products worth $6 million.
 &HT;    As would be expected, Amazon.com is a Wall Street darling,
having declared two three-for-one splits on its common stock in the
last three months. It has also seen its shares rise from $9 in May
1997 to a little over $163 as of Jan. 11, 1999.
 &HT;    All these breathtaking figures, however, have not yet translated
into a stronger bottom line for the bookseller. Music and video
sales traditionally have had very thin profit margins, and the
company remains unprofitable. At press time, no specifics on 1998
fourth-quarter losses had yet been released, but industry analysts
forecast a loss of about 56 cents a share.
 &HT;    In the past, Bezos has attributed losses to aggressive
advertising campaigns and internal investment strategies. ``This is
an investment phase for Amazon.com,'' He told the Seattle Times
last summer. ``We've been totally straightforward with everybody
from the beginning that that's our strategy, and a lot of people
believe in our strategy and some people don't. Reasonable people
could disagree.'' (Bezos and his wife, Mackenzie, own about 45
percent of the company.)
 &HT;    For all the attention, wealth, and notoriety that Amazon has
garnered, the young billionaire behind it all remains a fairly
inaccessible person. Several requests to interview Bezos by phone
or by e-mail for this article were denied. Questions sent via
e-mail to a publicity assistant were not all answered.
 &HT;    According to other reporters, Bezos has a slight frame, often
wears white shirts and khaki pants, and has thinning brown hair.
But what stands out in photographs of this technology tycoon is his
apparently warm smile, his smooth, tanned skin, and his big brown
eyes. Bezos certainly looks boyish, and with his youthful
countenance he brings a decidedly fresh, counterculture approach to
his working environment. He reportedly drives a Honda Accord to
work and still rents an apartment month-to-month in Belltown, a
downtown Seattle neighborhood.
 &HT;    According to his assistant, Kay Dangaard, Bezos was the eldest
of three children, born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to Mike and
Jackie Bezos. His father was a petroleum engineer; his mother, a
homemaker who hailed from Virginia. ``His father was just 15 when
he left Cuba, and has never returned,'' Dangaard said via e-mail.
 &HT;    The Bezos family grew up in Miami and Houston. Young Jeffrey
spent many summers on his grandfather's ranch in Cotulla, Texas,
learning the ways of the land and many unoffice-like skills such as
fixing windmills, driving bulldozers, laying water lines, building
fences, and castrating cattle.
 &HT;    All the while, he dreamed of a career as a physicist, and he
enrolled at Princeton University to pursue his goal. In his
sophomore year, Bezos switched tracks when he realized that his
talent was in computers. He graduated in 1986, summa cum laude, Phi
Beta Kappa, in electrical engineering and computer science.
 &HT;    In an extensive interview last fall with several staff members
of the Washington Post, Bezos discussed his next venture for Amazon
_ a shopping referral service to help his 4.5 million customers
discover new products for sale on the Web. One service already
provided to many repeat buyers is that, based on their choices, the
company compiles listings of offerings they might be interested in.
 &HT;    This is what Bezos considers a ``personalization tool'' that
will increase the number of return site visits and give Internet
retailing the human touch it so sorely lacks.
 &HT;    Although the Web customization process rankles privacy freaks,
Bezos told the Post that the service ``is like retreating to the
time when you have small-town merchants who got to know you, and
they could help you get the right products.''
 &HT;    Computers may be the muscle that moves Amazon.com, but the heart
of the business is in a warehouse located in South Seattle, across
from a pawnshop and a building housing a needle exchange program.
Another warehouse is located in Newcastle, Del., and a third is
slated to open later this year in Nevada.
 &HT;    Here you will find employees, mostly in their 20s, wearing
comfortable clothes and sensible shoes for walking the miles of
aisles to physically pick out books and CDs to fill orders.
Neckties are no-no's, but dogs are welcome to join their masters at
work.
 &HT;    Fortunately, not everyone involved in book commerce is waiting
with bated breath to see which of the cyber arch-enemies will
emerge victorious. Marina Tristan, assistant director at Arte
Publico Press, in Houston, says that on a personal level, on-line
book ordering will never match the pleasure of browsing through a
bookstore. ``You know what I mean,'' she says. ``Holding a book in
your hands, reading excerpts.''
 &HT;    Instead, the small press, which operates out of the University
of Houston, views Internet booksellers as an additional marketing
tool to advertise its catalog.
 &HT;    Tristan says small brick-and-mortar bookstores, which are the
major outlets for Arte Publico, are still reeling from the impact
of the dizzying changes in the industry in recent years.
Consolidations of major book chains, wholesalers, and distributors
have resulted in the closure of numerous independent bookstores
across the country. ``To tell you the truth, Amazon.com has not had
a huge impact on us,'' she says.
 &HT;    Not yet, maybe, but the consensus is that Amazon.com has indeed
had a great impact in certain areas, revolutionizing the Web as a
retail outlet. As it continues to grow, it should make book readers
out of still more unsuspecting surfers.

   AT PASSOVER, AGE-OLD TRADITIONS COME ALIVE. Childhood Passover
is something that became part of her and part of who she is as an
adult, says columnist Linda Marx. ``As a Jew, everything I do and
everything I think at this time of the year goes back to my family
and the religious traditions they instilled in me,'' she writes.
``I learned more from them than from all the years of religious
studies.'' Linda Marx describes the Passovers of yesteryear with
countless relatives gathered round, and the Passovers of today with
friends old and new, who watch their waistlines and drink Cabernet
Sauvignon instead of Kosher wine. ``Nothing stays the same,'' she
observes sadly.

their disappearance, unlike that of mangrove trees, has gone

pines in sheer numbers, cypress occupy 1.6-million wetland acres
and are essential for water purification, flood control and as
habitat for wildlife. But tragically these mighty trees for the
most part are being cut down for mulch. ``For many homeowners, in

bitterly. ``We are fools to let this continue.''

   AT PASSOVER, AGE-OLD TRADITIONS COME ALIVE. Childhood Passover
is something that became part of her and part of who she is as an
adult, says columnist Linda Marx. ``As a Jew, everything I do and
everything I think at this time of the year goes back to my family
and the religious traditions they instilled in me,'' she writes.
``I learned more from them than from all the years of religious
studies.'' Linda Marx describes the Passovers of yesteryear with
countless relatives gathered round, and the Passovers of today with
friends old and new, who watch their waistlines and drink Cabernet
Sauvignon instead of Kosher wine. ``Nothing stays the same,'' she
observes sadly.

   TV WARNINGS FOR `HOMOSEXUAL CONTENT' A BAD IDEA. Last month when
the Rev. Jerry Falwell issued his Tinky Winky ``alert'' to parents,
he wasn't the only Christian concerned about a ``gay role model''
on television. Martin Mawyer, president of the Christian Action
Network, has also suggested that the Federal Communications
Commission place a warning label _ HC _ on TV shows that contain
``homosexual content,'' reports columnist Chuck Colbert. But what's
really going on with Falwell and Mawyer, writes Colbert, ``is a
conservative backlash against the progress that gays and lesbians
have made in Hollywood.''

   THE REAL ACADEMY AWARD `BLACK LIST.' The lack of nominations of
black performers and filmmakers to the 1999 Academy Awards was very
evident to columnist Akilah Monifa. Comprising 25 percent of
domestic box office sales and an even larger percentage of key
urban markets, black filmgoers see the big Hollywood hits as well
as movies that African Americans direct, produce, and star in _
``films that will probably never receive any Academy recognition,''
she writes. ``It is time for the entertainment industry to redress
this exclusion. As award winner Chris Tashima (the only person of
color) said, diversity is the true American star.''

HEINZE'S HIGHLIGHTS PILING UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For someone who couldn't buy a goal early in the
season, Steve Heinze certainly has turned his season around.
</P>
<P>
   Heinze's two goals in Thursday &UR;  &LR; night's 3-3 tie with Chicago at
the FleetCenter gave the Bruins right wing seven goals in as many
games and also enabled him to crack the 20-goal mark.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Heinze's goals, the Bruins' first two of the game, were
on the power play, and both came in the second period. The second
came on a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of knowing where the openings are and where the
puck might bounce, so it's a matter of being in the right place at
the right time,'' said Heinze, whose longest goal drought this
season has been six games.
</P>
<P>
   Heinze's first goal was at 11:13, with Kyle McLaren and Ray
Bourque picking up assists. The second goal, which tied the game at
2-2, was off McLaren and Joe Thornton assists with 48.5 seconds
left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Two shots, two goals. Heinze isn't going to analyze his success,
though. He's just hoping the timing's right and will continue
through the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The puck's going in so I'll keep staying confident and I'll
keep going on the ice and, hopefully, I'll keep doing things I'm
doing, keep putting the puck in the net,'' said Heinze, no longer
bothered by the hip flexor that caused him to miss five games in
early February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great, I'm getting a lot of ice time, getting out there
on our power play and I feel like I'm skating OK and I'm getting
the puck. The games just go that way sometimes, so you just try not
to overthink and get in the right spot. It was certainly one of
those games and I just hope to get more of them.''
</P>
<P>
   With the puck seemingly finding its way into the net easily for
him, Heinze wants to make sure he's on the ice as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're getting the ice time, you're playing so you always want
to be on the ice,'' Heinze said. ``You want to start the game,
finish the game, play on power plays, play late in the game as well
as win the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things are going right, it tends to build on itself and
the puck goes in, so you shoot it rather than hoping it goes in.
You think another goal. It's a confidence thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty goals may not seem like an extraordinary accomplishment,
but considering the way defensive play is stressed in today's NHL,
it's impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty goals is 20 goals,'' Heinze said. ``Twenty goals is now
a pretty big number, especially looking at the stats. There may not
be a guy who hits 50 goals this year.''

<P>
   The West has stumbled into one of its riskiest ventures since
the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   It may pick itself up, and emerge standing proud and erect,
having been a decisive force for good. Or it may fall flat, with
NATO, its military club, weaker than at any time in its 50 years of
life, and the Balkans ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   To armchair strategists, bombing Serbia may not seem especially
risky. When NATO took to the air to strike the Bosnian Serbs, in
1995, none of the dire consequences predicted by doubters ensued;
in due course a peace treaty was signed, which has worked
remarkably well.
</P>
<P>
   Western aircraft now routinely bomb Iraq; they may not unseat
Saddam Hussein, but they appear to run no great risks.
</P>
<P>
   This latest operation, however, is not quite like those others.
First, it is NATO's first unambiguous attack on a sovereign state
that stands accused of being vile not to its neighbors but only to
its own people.
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior, offensive as it is, has long been considered the
prerogative of properly constituted governments. It is widely
practiced, and often without much more than a tut-tut from the
West.
</P>
<P>
   Where was NATO, for instance, when Russia tried to squelch the
Chechens, at a cost of 50,000-100,000 lives?
</P>
<P>
   This week's attack on Serbia may be the start of an admirable
new trend to restrain thugs and despots, though that does not look
terribly likely. What is undeniable is that the attack is something
new, and it could set an awkward precedent.
</P>
<P>
   How would the West respond if one day China, say, were to carry
out air strikes against an Indian government fighting to prevent
its Muslim-majority province of Jammu and Kashmir from seceding?
</P>
<P>
   Second, Serbia is better armed and militarily more sophisticated
than the Bosnian Serbs and even latter-day Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of this, NATO's political bosses have drawn
exactly the wrong conclusion. Instead of maximizing their military
power, they have forsworn the use of ground troops, except to
uphold a peace agreement that may never come into being.
</P>
<P>
   Beguiled by technology, they may perhaps believe that smart
bombs and Tomahawk missiles can nowadays win military victories
without the help of foot soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Events may prove them correct. But right now, as the operation
begins, many military men say they are wrong, especially in the
terrain of Kosovo, where military targets and civilians are
inextricably mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Iraq, where conditions are much more favorable,
sustained bombing has yet to produce an outcome satisfactory to the
West.
</P>
<P>
   In Serbia, if NATO was not prepared to commit itself fully and
wholeheartedly, it might have been better not to threaten to attack
at all, rather than to attack from the relative safety of the sky
alone.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, NATO's 19 members, despite their initial unity, are
deeply uneasy about the operation. Several _ including Italy, whose
proximity makes it valuable as a base from which to stage attacks _
are generally reluctant warriors unless they see some imminent
threat to their national security.
</P>
<P>
   Their hesitations have already encouraged Serbia's president,
Slobodan Milosevic, in his refusal to make concessions at the
negotiating table; they could yet curtail a military campaign that
should go on for weeks if it is to have any chance of achieving its
aims.
</P>
<P>
   And what are those aims? Ostensibly, just to put an end to
Serbia's brutal treatment of the ethnic Albanians who make up
nine-tenths of the population of the province of Kosovo, and to do
so without breaking up the country.
</P>
<P>
   But if the blunt instrument of bombing succeeds in this, it will
owe as much to luck as to precision.
</P>
<P>
   The hope must be that, after a mind-concentrating battery from
the air, discontented members of Serbia's armed forces will
speedily remove Milosevic and replace him with someone more
conciliatory. Or perhaps they might leave him in office, but
persuade him to come to terms with the West.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible, however, that the Serbs will fight on,
possibly with greater determination than ever. If so, the Albanians
of Kosovo may well be killed or driven from their homes in ever
greater numbers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if the bombardment were to tip the balance of
power against the Serbs in Kosovo, the guerrillas there might well
exact horrible revenge on the Serb minority in the province.
Without ground troops, NATO would be hard put to stop this.
</P>
<P>
   What can the West do to increase the chances of success, however
defined? For a start, it can and should do its utmost to tell the
Serb people at large that the outside world bears no animus against
them; that in western eyes, and not just those of Russia, Serbia's
declared ally, their country is a pivotal state with an important
role to play in Europe; and that sanctions of all kinds will be
lifted as soon as it shows itself ready to behave decently.
</P>
<P>
   Since this sort of message cannot be conveyed through Serbia's
controlled press and radio, it should be broadcast from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Other means should be used to undermine Milosevic. Montenegro,
Serbia's tiny sister-component in what remains of the Yugoslav
federation, should be encouraged to break free, even though it has
not been spared airborne attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovars, however, should be told that the West is not
intervening to give them their independence, even though events, if
they spin out of control, may well lead ultimately to secession.
</P>
<P>
   In time, NATO may have to declare Kosovo, or at least a large
part of it, an area into which the Serb authorities should not
venture on pain of retribution, much as parts of Iraq have been
declared off-limits to those who do Saddam's bidding.
</P>
<P>
   But first the province will have to be rid of the Serb forces
that are concentrated there, and without, in so doing, turning its
capital Pristina into a slaughterhouse.
</P>
<P>
   None of this will be easy. At every turn lies the possibility
that fighting will spill over into nearby states, most of which are
an unstable cocktail of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in time there can be a general redrawing of Balkan
borders, with Serbia losing Kosovo and gaining a bit of Bosnia. But
that must await a general cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the West has a war to fight. If it makes a mess
of it, NATO's 50th birthday party next month will be a sad affair.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the world's diminished but by no means extinct band of
dictators will judge that they can, after all, treat their own
people as brutally as they like. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Worse, the world's diminished but by no means extinct band of
dictators will judge that they can, after all, treat their own
people as brutally as they like. &QL;

<P>
   Monetary policy is often likened to driving with a blacked-out
windshield, a wonky speedometer and a cracked rear-view mirror. But
at least a motorist knows that if he touches the brake or the
accelerator, the car will respond immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates are more complex. A rise in rates seems like a
tightening of policy and a cut like an easing; so keeping rates
constant seems ``neutral'' (i.e., neither stimulating nor reining
in the economy).
</P>
<P>
   This thinking is flawed _ a point America's Federal Reserve
should remember when its policy-making open-market committee meets
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Most commentators argue that the Fed does not need to raise
interest rates now because inflation remains low, making a neutral
monetary policy appropriate. But current policy is not neutral: it
is deliberately loose.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed, remember, cut rates three times last autumn, by a total
of three-quarters of a percentage point. Its justification was the
financial-market turmoil in the wake of Russia's default _ and
notably a sharp rise in credit spreads and a plunge in share
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Since last September, fears of a credit crunch have dissipated;
the Dow has risen by some 25 percent; and, rather than being harmed
by global economic slowdown, the American economy has grown even
more briskly than had been predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, merely to return its policy stance to the position of last
summer, the Fed needs to nudge interest rates up again.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that real interest rates in America are above their
30-year average of 2 percent _ but that does not mean that policy
is tight. The appropriate interest rate depends not only on the
level of inflation, but also on the amount of slack in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   With GDP surging by an annual rate of over 6 percent in the
fourth quarter of 1998, and with unemployment unusually low, the
American economy is running well above its sustainable growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   In such circumstances, a small rise in interest rates is
equivalent not to stamping on the brakes, but to easing up slightly
on the accelerator. Keeping rates where they are amounts to driving
at a constant high speed even when the road ahead bends sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, financial conditions are more lax than they seem. A
rise in share prices boosts spending in similar ways to a cut in
interest rates or a cheaper dollar. This is no small matter, given
that the assets of mutual funds overtook those of banks last year.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, taking account of the impact on the economy of higher
share prices, as well as last year's cuts in interest rates,
financial conditions in America are now at their most accommodating
since 1993, when the economy was crawling out of recession. Rapid
growth in America's broad money supply bears this out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet why worry when inflation remains low? Increased competition
and technological advances may have helped America's economy to
grow faster without pushing up inflation, but the drop in inflation
has also owed a lot to falling oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the recent rise in oil prices is not sustained, that
windfall is likely to disappear over the next year; so inflation
could well creep up.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even if inflation in the prices of goods and services
remains subdued, lax financial conditions carry risks of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Asset-price inflation can harm the economy as much as
consumer-price inflation. It can distort the allocation of
resources by encouraging reckless spending, for example. The
combined saving rate of households and firms in America has already
fallen to its lowest level ever.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, a risk that a rise in rates might instantly
trigger a sharp fall on Wall Street, bringing America's economy to
a grinding halt and thus harming the world too.
</P>
<P>
   But American policy should not be seen in isolation: while the
Fed should be raising rates, the European Central Bank should be
cutting them, and Japan needs reflation too.
</P>
<P>
   For the Fed, in the longer run doing nothing is riskier still.
It is not the central bank's job to prop up an overvalued stock
market. &QL;

SENATOR SAYS RACE TENSIONS COULD UNDERMINE WAR ON CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his first speech on the floor of the Senate,
Sen. Charles Schumer warned Thursday that tensions between New York
City's police force and minority groups threaten to undermine the
city's war on crime, and he called on the department to make major
policy changes to help close the widening racial rift.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a prepared text titled, ``Protect Me and Respect
Me,'' Schumer described himself as ``a friend of law enforcement
and the minority community'' who was deeply troubled by the anger
toward the police that has boiled over since the fatal shooting of
Amadou Diallo by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, a Democrat who lives in the Park Slope section of
Brooklyn, said that despite the ``model behavior'' of most police
officers, law-abiding black people ``are all too often hassled and
made to feel like lawbreakers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that white people are treated differently,'' said
Schumer as he stood behind a lectern at his desk in the rear of the
nearly empty Senate chamber. ``Minorities are humiliated and
angered by the indignity of being treated all too often as
presumptive criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said that he sympathized with the protesters who have
ringed Police Headquarters in Manhattan, and did not think they
should stop. But his decision to deliver his first major speech
about the Diallo shooting on Capitol Hill instead of in the city
seemed intended to distance him from the anti-police tone of the
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the speech, he said he wanted to avoid
``the tensions of the moment'' and take a different tack from the
protesters, offering proposals that he said could relieve racial
tensions while also improving community policing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am worried that the hostility could hamper effective crime
fighting,'' Schumer said in the interview. ``I think the police
will be more effective when the community feels more trusting of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Schumer called for the Police Department to move
more quickly to remove bad or abusive officers from the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor, the police chief, police union leaders, community
leaders and church leaders should all urge police officers to come
forward when there is a bad element on the force,'' he said. ``It
should be an honorable action, not a shameful action, to come
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, Schumer said, the police department must recruit more
minority police officers. ``When mostly white cops patrol
high-density, minority neighborhoods,'' he said, ``resentment is
bound to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's speech came a day after former Sen. Bill Bradley,
seeking the Democratic nomination for president, condemned the
Diallo shooting before an audience of defense lawyers in Manhattan.
Bradley said he was planning to give a major address next week
dealing with race relations and the police.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There are no second acts in American lives,'' wrote Scott
Fitzgerald. But there is plenty of contemporary evidence that he
was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton is the archetypal comeback kid. Donald Trump once
again stands as tall and flashy as his buildings. Oliver North,
would you believe it, hosts his own television show.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most intriguing example of all is Michael
Milken, the junk-bond king who symbolized the no-holds-barred
capitalism of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   After serving a two-year prison term for breaking securities
laws, Milken is now back among America's movers and shakers.
</P>
<P>
   He oversees a fast-growing business empire and extensive charity
work and, as this month's conference at the institute that bears
his name confirmed, his ideas are taken increasingly seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Milken's life is the stuff of American myth. Born
on the Fourth of July, in 1946, to a modest Californian family, by
the mid-1980s he was a billionaire and one of the world's most
feared financiers.
</P>
<P>
   Working for a then modestly-sized investment-banking firm,
Drexel Burnham Lambert, he took on the Wall Street nobs by creating
a market for bonds issued by companies which, before, would have
been barely creditworthy enough to get a bank loan, let alone issue
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   By 1987, the value of these bonds had soared from nearly nothing
to $200 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Persistent investigations into Drexel's activities by an
ambitious young lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, now New York's mayor,
eventually led Milken to plead guilty to six breaches of securities
law. He was fined over $1 billion and sent to jail, his reputation
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Junk bonds had been heavily bought by savings-and-loan
companies; when junk-bond prices fell, many of these S&AMP;Ls went
bust, leading to a government bail-out that cost taxpayers billions
of dollars. Drexel Burnham Lambert went bust, too.
</P>
<P>
   Blame for much of this was laid at Milken's cell door, and worse
was to follow. Soon after leaving prison he was told he had
prostate cancer, and 18 months to live.
</P>
<P>
   Today he is alive and well enough to joke about looking forward
to watching the Rolling Stones when ``they're 85 and I'm 75.''
</P>
<P>
   He seems to be as energetic and hard-working as he was in the
1980s, and looks almost as youthful (thanks, in part, to ditching
his ghastly toupee).
</P>
<P>
   This recovery he attributes to meditation (he is, after all, a
Californian) and abandoning a diet as junky as his bonds for one
almost free of fat and meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taste for Living Cookbook: Mike Milken's Favorite Recipes
for Fighting Cancer'' was published last September, with revenues
going to a charity, CaP CURE, for which he has already raised more
than $63 million for research into prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A lifetime ban has prevented his returning to the securities
business. But he is developing another fast-growing enterprise,
Knowledge Universe, a ``cradle-to-grave learning company,'' founded
in 1997 with his younger brother, Lowell, and Larry Ellison, the
boss of Oracle, a software company.
</P>
<P>
   Its various activities, which span the largest vocational
training business in Britain, operating elementary schools in
Pennsylvania and LeapFrog educational toys, already generate sales
of $1.2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next few weeks, Milken will see if he can still sell
to Wall Street when he tries to float Knowledge Universe's
consulting arm, Nextera Enterprises, for an estimated $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   Were privatization to sweep through education as it has through
health care, business analysts reckon that Knowledge Universe might
well become the dominant brand.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the turnout to hear him at this month's ``global
conference'' at the Milken Institute _ founded in 1991 _ his social
standing has been fully restored, too.
</P>
<P>
   Wealthy capitalists such as Rupert Murdoch and Mort Zuckerman
chewed the low-fat with four Nobel prize-winning economists and a
clutch of politicians in the same Beverly Hills hotel where Milken
once hosted a junk-bond conference called the ``Predators' Ball.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine their European counterparts turning up to
honor a disgraced tycoon _ Ernest Saunders, say, or Jurgen
Schneider. But the Milken Institute is a serious outfit, a
nonprofit think-tank concerned (to quote the website) with ``the
global economy, capital markets...and the role of education and
human capital.''
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to see Milken's life as a contemporary morality
tale: greedy capitalist bad boy redeems his life by devoting
himself to good works. Intriguingly, Milken does not see himself
that way.
</P>
<P>
   As he tells it, his current and former activities are different
aspects of the same mission he has been on since witnessing the
Watts riots in Los Angeles in 1965. Put simply, this is to extend
capital, in all its forms, to people with too little of it.
</P>
<P>
   He has even come up with an equation to prove the point,
P &QC; FT(HC+SC+RA):
prosperity equals financial technology (of which junk bonds are an
important part) times the sum of human capital (which will rise if
people are better educated, live longer) and social capital (which
the Milken Institute may help increase) and real assets (stocks,
bonds, property, and so on).
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Milken's financial innovations are regarded much more
warmly now than they were in the 1980s. High-yield bonds (no longer
dismissed as junk) are credited with fueling much of America's
rampant economic growth, by enabling companies with bright ideas to
get the money they need to develop them.
</P>
<P>
   Some Wall Streeters reckon that Milken was jailed on
technicalities, after an investigation that makes Ken Starr's look
halfhearted. Some admirers of Milken even suggest that his
contributions to human well-being exceeded those of, say, Mother
Teresa, even before he switched his attention from finance to
healing the sick and educating the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes America can seem too forgiving, especially of those
who are, or were, rich or famous enough to hire a good lawyer or
public-relations adviser. But Michael Milken shows it can pay not
to keep people down when they fall. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There are no second acts in American lives,'' wrote Scott
Fitzgerald. But there is plenty of contemporary evidence that he
was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton is the archetypal comeback kid. Donald Trump once
again stands as tall and flashy as his buildings. Oliver North,
would you believe it, hosts his own television show.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most intriguing example of all is Michael
Milken, the junk-bond king who symbolized the no-holds-barred
capitalism of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   After serving a two-year prison term for breaking securities
laws, Milken is now back among America's movers and shakers.
</P>
<P>
   He oversees a fast-growing business empire and extensive charity
work and, as this month's conference at the institute that bears
his name confirmed, his ideas are taken increasingly seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Milken's life is the stuff of American myth. Born
on the Fourth of July, in 1946, to a modest Californian family, by
the mid-1980s he was a billionaire and one of the world's most
feared financiers.
</P>
<P>
   Working for a then modestly-sized investment-banking firm,

KINGS EYEING BERG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ A missing piece to the Kings' puzzle this season was
21-year-old defenseman Aki Berg.
</P>
<P>
   One of the team's top prospects, Berg opted before the season to
play in his native Finland when he couldn't reach contract terms
with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, Berg and Kings general manager Dave
Taylor met briefly while Taylor was on a scouting trip in Finland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just went to talk to him after a game,'' Taylor said
Thursday night following the Kings' 2-1 loss to Dallas. ``I invited
him to dinner. He didn't want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago, Berg spoke with a reporter for a Finnish sports
newspaper. According to a translator, Berg said: ``I just briefly
met Taylor. We just said, `Hi.' I never told him that I'm coming
back to L.A. Everything is still open. But if the negotiations are
like last time, I'm never coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he wants Berg back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's appropriate to talk while he's still
playing there,'' Taylor said. ``As soon as the season is over,
we'll talk to his agent (Larry Kelly of Ottawa). We'd like to bring
him back. We're not going to trade him. We'll negotiate with him,
but we're not going to overpay.''
</P>
<P>
   The Finnish playoffs end in a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Babych arrives: The newest King was not in the lineup Thursday
night, but he said he's ready to contribute when he gets the
chance, an opportunity that may come Sunday in Colorado when the
Kings begin a five-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Babych arrived in town Wednesday, and practiced with his
new team for the first time Thursday morning. Drafted in 1980 and
approaching his 38th birthday, Babych said he's planning on playing
next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing for sure,'' said Babych, acquired Tuesday in the
trade that sent Steve Duchesne to Philadelphia. ``I'm not ready to
stop. I've got no doubt about it. I feel too good to stop. I think
I'd be cheating myself if I didn't want to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Babych's contract expires after the season, but he said he'd
like to remain with the Kings next season. He also said he believes
he can help the team immediately, if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got seven defensemen here,'' he said. ``They know they
can count on me to step in and not hurt the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Babych, Kings coach Larry Robinson said: ``I think he's very
similar to Dougie Bodger, a real smart player, a big strong kid who
can move the puck. He played on the power play in Philadelphia.
He's a cagey veteran, is what he is.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like the overgrown college kid he too often
resembles, Bill Clinton plunged into the Kosovo battle as though he
were cramming for exams.
</P>
<P>
   For months he had done his best to ignore this approaching test
of his leadership, preparing neither public nor Congress for the
possibility of war. Then, with the breakdown of peace talks in
France on March 19, the president scrambled to make up for his past
negligence.
</P>
<P>
   He called a press conference, his first in nine months. He
devoted a speech to Kosovo, even though his audience that day
happened to be a union group. And, in telephone calls, letters and
White House meetings, he pleaded for the sympathy of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   By the eve of Serbia's bombing, he had just about succeeded in
uniting America behind his policy. But only just.
</P>
<P>
   The president's first challenge was a House vote on Kosovo
policy on March 11. For reasons good and bad, the Republican
leadership seemed disinclined to support military action.
</P>
<P>
   Tom DeLay and Dick Armey, still smarting from the impeachment
battle, wanted to score electoral points. Christopher Cox, the most
sophisticated of the senior House Republicans, argued that the
president had not discharged his constitutional obligation to ask
Congress for money for his Balkan plans.
</P>
<P>
   The administration was so worried that it might lose the vote
that it pleaded for its postponement.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a fifth of the House Republicans supported a tepid
resolution approving military involvement in Kosovo, narrowly
saving the administration from humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate proved still trickier. On March 19 Clinton invited a
few key senators over to the White House to press his case for
intervention, and on March 23 he did it again. He also wrote a
letter to Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, who had earlier
drafted a resolution that would have barred money for air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, it seemed as though Clinton might have waited too
long to launch his charm offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Many senators were already on the record opposing intervention,
on the ground that America should on principle avoid getting
embroiled in civil wars, or that the president had exceeded his
prerogative by planning for war without consulting Congress first.
</P>
<P>
   When the vote came, however, the Senate shrank from pulling the
rug from under him. On March 23 it voted, 58 to 41, to support air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote supporting military intervention was hedged about
with conditions and provisos: it required the president to explain
the precise nature of American interests in Kosovo, the cost of
intervention, his exit strategy, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's support was just as qualified. Senator John McCain,
a Republican presidential aspirant, emphasized that he voted for
air strikes in order to produce unity in crisis, not because he
supported the president's policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress and the American people have good reason to fear that
we are heading toward another permanent garrison of Americans in a
Balkan country,'' growled the senator.
</P>
<P>
   The half-support in Congress mirrored the mood in the country. A
Gallup poll taken just after the president's press conference
showed narrow support for air strikes: 46 percent favored them, but
43 percent were opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The same poll found that a clear majority (58 percent) believed
America had a moral obligation to help keep the peace in Kosovo,
whereas only a minority (42 percent) was persuaded that America
ought to get involved to protect its national interests.
</P>
<P>
   The striking thing about these findings, however, was the
contrast with the same poll a month earlier. The support for
intervention, and the belief in the various justifications for it,
had all strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, this strengthening was roughly proportional to the
rise in the percentage of respondents saying that they followed the
Kosovo question closely. The more Americans focus on foreign
policy, the more they are willing to accept its risks and costs.
</P>
<P>
   The polling data, together with the shift in favor of the
administration in Congress, pose an obvious question. If Clinton is
able to increase support for his policy by explaining it
energetically, why did he not do so earlier?
</P>
<P>
   The simplest answer is temperament: the president lacks the
discipline to work steadily on big issues, and so is reduced to
last-minute scrambling.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a more complicated answer. On some issues, the
president's party and advisers are so divided that firm leadership
is not easy. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such divisions certainly exist on trade, for example. Clinton's
economic team, led by Bob Rubin and Larry Summers at Treasury, is
by and large supportive of trade liberalization, whereas the
labor-union base of the Democratic Party is hostile.
</P>
<P>
   This explains why Clinton never made a convincing case for
fast-track trade-negotiating authority, which Congress consequently
blocked.
</P>
<P>
   On Kosovo, too, there are splits. Madeleine Albright, the
secretary of state, is a staunch interventionist. Richard
Holbrooke, the administration's chief negotiator with Serbia, ought
to be an ally, but his personal rivalry with Mrs. Albright gets in
the way.
</P>
<P>
   William Cohen, the defense secretary, plays up the potential
risks of bombing Serbia. The Pentagon top brass hates the idea of
getting embroiled in Kosovo peacekeeping, which it regards as
``social work.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than impose unity on these squabbling parties, Clinton
kept his head down _ until crisis obliged him to sit up. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM; TOTAL UNCUT VERSION IS 1,100 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Contemplating this chaos, Republican strategists are
increasingly inclined to make foreign policy an election issue.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's China policy has been tarnished by a spy
scandal; its support for Boris Yeltsin has not prevented Russia
from descending into chaos; it hardly pretends any longer to have a
policy on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kosovo crisis ends badly, Republicans reckon that they
have a powerful stick with which to beat Democratic foes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the truth is that Republicans are as divided on foreign
policy as the Democrats. The Senate debate on Kosovo featured
virulent exchanges between Republican interventionists and
stay-at-homers; and most of the party's usual heavyweights ended
the debate sitting inelegantly on the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy used to be an election winner for Republicans
because they were clear what they believed in. Now the party wants
to get tough on China but soft on Serbia; it wants to assert
American power, but only if there is a quick way out.
</P>

NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT NYC POLICE CHIEF'S OSCAR JAUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The company that controls Revlon Inc. hires off-duty
New York City police officers, in uniform, to guard its offices at
night under a city-sponsored arrangement that may complicate the
ethics inquiry into Police Commissioner Howard Safir's free trip to
the Academy Awards with the president of Revlon.
</P>
<P>
   Safir has said he does not believe the trip last weekend with
his friend, Revlon president George Fellows, is an ethical
violation because, although officials are barred from accepting
gifts from companies that do business with the city, Revlon does
not hold any such contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But the definition of ``business dealings'' in the city ethics
code is a broad one that encompasses much more than simple
contractual relationships and includes such matters as real estate
purchases and license applications. And City Councilman Sheldon
Leffler, chairman of the Public Safety Committee, which oversees
the Police Department, said the use of off-duty officers at a
company affiliated with Revlon may constitute a business dealing as
defined by the code.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not good judgment for the commissioner to accept the
trip in a jet and the hotel and whatever else that goes with it
while at the same time the department is allowing these people to
participate in the program,'' Leffler said.
</P>
<P>
   The affiliate of Revlon, Mac Andrews &AMP; Forbes, which holds 83
percent of Revlon stock, is one of about 100 companies that take
part in the Paid Detail program, in which companies register with
the Police Department and hire off-duty officers in uniform to
guard their premises.
</P>
<P>
   Safir started the program two years ago to increase police
presence on the streets without additional expense. The companies
pay the officers $27 an hour and the city a $2.70-an-hour
administrative fee.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Mac Andrews &AMP; Forbes said that, since April
1998, the company has employed an off-duty officer six nights a
week to patrol outside its headquarters on East 63rd Street, the
same block where Ronald Perelman, the company's owner, lives.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, James Conroy, said it was inaccurate to describe
the use of the off-duty officers as a business relationship and
said the arrangement was ``utterly unrelated to the friendship
between Howard Safir and George Fellows.'' He said Fellows was not
affiliated with Mac Andrews &AMP; Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The city Law Department, at Safir's request, is reviewing the
propriety of his trip with Fellows, a friend who invited the
Commissioner and his wife on the trip last weekend and paid for
their $700-a-night hotel suite in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Safir's spokeswoman, Marilyn Mode, agreed that employing the
police officers could not be construed as a business relationship
between Revlon and the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the nexus at all,'' Ms. Mode said. Although
companies must apply and be approved to be part of the program, she
said, she did not think that any company had ever been rejected.
``We administer this as a courtesy to the officers and to maintain
the integrity,'' she said. ``We don't make money off of this. We
just cover our costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Davies, executive director of the Conflict of Interest
Board, which interprets the city's ethics code, said the city code
defines business dealings in a broad fashion. ``The board takes the
position that a business dealing is some pending matter,'' he said.
``It could be a contract with the city. It could be the sale or
exchange of services or a license or permit application.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like the overgrown college kid he too often
resembles, Bill Clinton plunged into the Kosovo battle as though he
were cramming for exams.
</P>
<P>
   For months he had done his best to ignore this approaching test
of his leadership, preparing neither public nor Congress for the
possibility of war. Then, with the breakdown of peace talks in
France on March 19, the president scrambled to make up for his past
negligence.
</P>
<P>
   He called a press conference, his first in nine months. He
devoted a speech to Kosovo, even though his audience that day
happened to be a union group. And, in telephone calls, letters and
White House meetings, he pleaded for the sympathy of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   By the eve of Serbia's bombing, he had just about succeeded in
uniting America behind his policy. But only just.
</P>
<P>
   The president's first challenge was a House vote on Kosovo
policy on March 11. For reasons good and bad, the Republican
leadership seemed disinclined to support military action.
</P>
<P>
   Tom DeLay and Dick Armey, still smarting from the impeachment
battle, wanted to score electoral points. Christopher Cox, the most
sophisticated of the senior House Republicans, argued that the
president had not discharged his constitutional obligation to ask
Congress for money for his Balkan plans.
</P>
<P>
   The administration was so worried that it might lose the vote
that it pleaded for its postponement.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a fifth of the House Republicans supported a tepid
resolution approving military involvement in Kosovo, narrowly
saving the administration from humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate proved still trickier. On March 19 Clinton invited a
few key senators over to the White House to press his case for
intervention, and on March 23 he did it again. He also wrote a
letter to Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, who had earlier
drafted a resolution that would have barred money for air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, it seemed as though Clinton might have waited too
long to launch his charm offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Many senators were already on the record opposing intervention,
on the ground that America should on principle avoid getting
embroiled in civil wars, or that the president had exceeded his
prerogative by planning for war without consulting Congress first.
</P>
<P>
   When the vote came, however, the Senate shrank from pulling the
rug from under him. On March 23 it voted, 58 to 41, to support air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote supporting military intervention was hedged about
with conditions and provisos: it required the president to explain
the precise nature of American interests in Kosovo, the cost of
intervention, his exit strategy, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's support was just as qualified. Senator John McCain,
a Republican presidential aspirant, emphasized that he voted for
air strikes in order to produce unity in crisis, not because he
supported the president's policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress and the American people have good reason to fear that
we are heading toward another permanent garrison of Americans in a
Balkan country,'' growled the senator.
</P>
<P>
   The half-support in Congress mirrored the mood in the country. A
Gallup poll taken just after the president's press conference
showed narrow support for air strikes: 46 percent favored them, but
43 percent were opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The same poll found that a clear majority (58 percent) believed
America had a moral obligation to help keep the peace in Kosovo,
whereas only a minority (42 percent) was persuaded that America
ought to get involved to protect its national interests.
</P>
<P>
   The striking thing about these findings, however, was the
contrast with the same poll a month earlier. The support for
intervention, and the belief in the various justifications for it,
had all strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, this strengthening was roughly proportional to the
rise in the percentage of respondents saying that they followed the
Kosovo question closely. The more Americans focus on foreign
policy, the more they are willing to accept its risks and costs.
</P>
<P>
   The polling data, together with the shift in favor of the
administration in Congress, pose an obvious question. If Clinton is
able to increase support for his policy by explaining it
energetically, why did he not do so earlier?
</P>
<P>
   The simplest answer is temperament: the president lacks the
discipline to work steadily on big issues, and so is reduced to
last-minute scrambling.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a more complicated answer. On some issues, the
president's party and advisers are so divided that firm leadership
is not easy. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such divisions certainly exist on trade, for example. Clinton's
economic team, led by Bob Rubin and Larry Summers at Treasury, is
by and large supportive of trade liberalization, whereas the
labor-union base of the Democratic Party is hostile.
</P>
<P>
   This explains why Clinton never made a convincing case for
fast-track trade-negotiating authority, which Congress consequently
blocked.
</P>
<P>
   On Kosovo, too, there are splits. Madeleine Albright, the
secretary of state, is a staunch interventionist. Richard
Holbrooke, the administration's chief negotiator with Serbia, ought
to be an ally, but his personal rivalry with Mrs. Albright gets in
the way.
</P>
<P>
   William Cohen, the defense secretary, plays up the potential
risks of bombing Serbia. The Pentagon top brass hates the idea of
getting embroiled in Kosovo peacekeeping, which it regards as
``social work.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than impose unity on these squabbling parties, Clinton
kept his head down _ until crisis obliged him to sit up. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM; TOTAL UNCUT VERSION IS 1,100 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Contemplating this chaos, Republican strategists are
increasingly inclined to make foreign policy an election issue.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's China policy has been tarnished by a spy
scandal; its support for Boris Yeltsin has not prevented Russia
from descending into chaos; it hardly pretends any longer to have a
policy on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kosovo crisis ends badly, Republicans reckon that they
have a powerful stick with which to beat Democratic foes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the truth is that Republicans are as divided on foreign
policy as the Democrats. The Senate debate on Kosovo featured
virulent exchanges between Republican interventionists and
stay-at-homers; and most of the party's usual heavyweights ended
the debate sitting inelegantly on the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy used to be an election winner for Republicans
because they were clear what they believed in. Now the party wants
to get tough on China but soft on Serbia; it wants to assert
American power, but only if there is a quick way out.
</P>
<P>
   How nice it would be if a change of team at the White House
could be counted upon to bring firmness to American foreign policy.
Alas, it cannot. &QL;

   DALLAS _ Along the busiest street in downtown Dallas, opposite a
billboard reading ``Who's the Father? Call 1-800-DNA-TYPE,'' there
is a message from a father of a different sort, one without a
genetic code.
</P>
<P>
   The sign reads ``What part of `Thou Shalt Not' didn't you
understand? _ God.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the road, another billboard carries a second
message attributed to the Almighty: ``You think it's hot here?''
</P>
<P>
   Since last month, similar black billboards with stark white
lettering have sprung up in more than 100 places about the city,
generally along Dallas's busiest roads. Drivers stuck in rush-hour
traffic may think twice before cursing the heavens in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Begun in south Florida last September, the ``God Speaks''
advertising campaign was at first financed by a wealthy individual
(insisting on anonymity) who believes the American ship has tossed
its moral compass overboard.
</P>
<P>
   According to Andy Smith, whose advertising agency created the
messages, ``Our society these days is a mess of murder, rape and
adultery. God gave us rules, and it is His rules we need to live
by.''
</P>
<P>
   The signs are meant to be a lighthearted way to get people to
think about God as the day rolls by.
</P>
<P>
   The response from Florida and Dallas has been so positive that
billboard companies around the country have agreed to donate
millions of dollars' worth of space.
</P>
<P>
   In a press conference on March 16, the campaign's organizers
said their goal was to have 10,000 billboards in more than 200
American markets by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it may be that these messages from God are, as they say,
``preaching to the choir.'' According to Gallup, which tracks
worldwide trends in religious beliefs, the United States is among
the most devout nations of the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Gallup poll, 63 percent of Americans said they
believe that religion can solve the vast majority of today's social
problems, a percentage which has remained stable for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Over 70 percent of Americans are members of a church or
synagogue, and 40 percent attend regularly, compared with only 12
percent in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is a good thing, then, that the God Speaks campaign
will soon go international. Advertising agencies around the world
have expressed interest in bringing the billboards to other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   By next year, drivers in Europe, South America and Africa may be
starting their day with one-liners from the Almighty.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers of the campaign point out that the messages are
strictly non-denominational, and should have meaning to anyone who
believes in a Supreme Being. Among these people, at least, there is
at last hope for a worldwide decline in road rage. &QL;

 AIDS FIGHTERS PIN HOPES ON IMMUNE THERAPIES  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ AIDS researchers offered some tantalizing
previews Thursday of what they hope will prove to be the first
effective immune-based therapies against the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
   Small-scale clinical studies have been yielding encouraging
results recently, the researchers said, particularly when the
experimental immune boosters follow anti-viral drug treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The state-of-the-art approach now coming into focus is to
``first lower the amount of virus, then immunize'' the patient for
lasting resistance to disease, said Dr. Ronald Moss, executive
director of medical and scientific affairs at the Immune Response
Corp. in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   He and other researchers summarized the latest findings Thursday
during the 11th annual National HIV/AIDS Update Conference, under
way this week at Bill Graham Civic Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   One or more of the immune-based therapies _ such as
interleukin-2, Remune and GM-CSF _ could turn out to be the key
missing ingredient needed to make the so-called multidrug cocktails
truly effective.
</P>
<P>
   None has proved itself in large-scale clinical tests, and there
have been frequent problems of side effects. Experts warn that the
complex interactions between the human immune system and the AIDS
virus make predictions impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Frost, director of clinical research at the American
Foundation for AIDS research, said immunology and AIDS has only
recently become a research priority. For 15 years, he noted, AIDS
researchers have concentrated almost exclusively at figuring out
how HIV replicates and trying to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing recent results with interleukin-2, Dr. James Kahn of
the University of California at San Francisco said researchers are
seeing ``tremendous potential'' for long-term recovery of immune
function. Test subjects given interleukin-2, along with anti-viral
drugs, showed a persistent benefit lasting nearly two years in some
cases.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment appears to boost the immune system as a whole,
Kahn said, as opposed to simply stimulating a specific type of
disease-fighting cell. Also, people with detectable amounts of HIV
in their blood, despite taking anti-viral drugs, seem to get
``enhanced viral repression.''
</P>
<P>
   Remune, a modified form of HIV, appears to help some test
subjects fight off multiple subtypes of the AIDS virus, Moss said.
The therapy, given by intravenous injection every three months,
seems to make disease-fighting immune cells capable of recognizing
certain parts of the AIDS virus that generally do not change when
HIV mutates.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stan Deresinski of Stanford University said that GM-CSF, a
synthetic form of a natural disease-fighting molecule, may be used
as an adjunct to anti-viral treatment to clear the virus from
hard-to-reach hiding places in the body.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the experimental treatment may amplify the
benefits of other immune-based strategies, including interleukin-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some potential for combination approaches,'' he said,
although he added that the first step will be to prove conclusively
that each element works on its own.

<P>
   BELGRADE _ Just ten days short of its 50th anniversary, the
Atlantic alliance has gone into battle with a medium-sized European
country, while vowing to protect all other states in the
neighborhood from the fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of starting with pinpricks, dozens of NATO aircraft
began a spectacular bombing campaign on the night of March 24 with
raids on airfields and arms factories near Belgrade, Serbia's
capital, and targets near Pristina, capital of Serbia's already
battered southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise missiles were launched from air and sea. Bombs also fell
on Montenegro _ Serbia's reluctant junior partner in the rump state
of Yugoslavia _ dashing its hopes of being spared.
</P>
<P>
   NATO raids continued on March 25.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Javier Solana, the NATO secretary-general,
had promised on the allies' behalf to ``disrupt'' Yugoslavia's war
against Kosovo's ethnic Albanians and their villages.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the latest repression ordered by Yugoslavia's
president, Slobodan Milosevic, convinced even NATO's doubters _
France, for one _ that something had to be done.
</P>
<P>
   His forces have uprooted at least 65,000 people in the past
month, bringing to 250,000 the number now homeless in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But right from the start there was confusion about NATO's
precise purpose and legal justification.
</P>
<P>
   As the bombs started falling, President Bill Clinton said the
raids were intended to demonstrate NATO's ``opposition to
aggression''; to deter further attacks on civilians; and ``if
necessary'' to damage Serbia's capacity to make war.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the first wave of bombs was intended as a
warning _ and only if it were ignored would NATO start seriously
destroying the Yugoslav arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Solana, for his part, suggested that Serbia was being punished
for its refusal to accept a settlement in Kosovo and let NATO
police it. He also stressed, however, that the alliance ``was not
waging war against Yugoslavia'' and had no quarrel with its (mainly
Serb) people.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the distinction between warnings and war could
vanish from sight if the conflict develops into a broader test of
wills between the western alliance and Serbia's power broker.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's trump cards include vast firepower and fairly solid unity
of purpose in its own ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, for his part, will be banking on his own people's
greater willingness to accept and inflict casualties _ and on the
fact that all nations, even exhausted and divided ones, tend to
rally around the flag when under attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government (which formally speaks for Serbia and an
increasingly restive Montenegro) has given grim warnings to
Romania, Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Macedonia not to take part
``directly or indirectly'' in any NATO actions.
</P>
<P>
   Of these countries, only Hungary (one of three ex-communist ones
to join the alliance last month) is covered by NATO's mutual
defense guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO has told the other four _ plus Slovenia _ that it would
view a Yugoslav attack on them very gravely.
</P>
<P>
   The reassurance is timely: Macedonia is host to 12,000 NATO
troops, in range of Serbian artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO's aircraft revved up their engines, the Yugoslav
leader's first moves were to complete a purge of the security
forces, and silence the voices of domestic opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The army's intelligence chief was replaced by someone even more
loyal; this, combined with the replacement in recent months of the
heads of both the armed forces and the secret service, will dampen
western hopes of a palace coup.
</P>
<P>
   As Belgrade's few remaining lights of independence went out, a
dissident radio station, B-92, was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic can certainly count, at least initially, on support
among his fellow Serbs. Most have no idea of the scale of the
refugee crisis, or the atrocities committed by their police; many
regard Kosovo as a symbol of their history and faith.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Serbia's propaganda has kept many citizens so
cocooned from reality that nobody can predict how they will react
when they realize NATO is not bluffing this time.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's forces are the rusting but still serviceable remnants
of an army that was built up during the Cold War as a defender of
Yugoslavia's non-aligned status. As well as buying Soviet-made
aircraft and air-defenses, the communist state made aircraft, tanks
and ships of its own.
</P>
<P>
   A well-integrated network of surface-to-air missile launchers,
including the mobile SA-6 which brought down an American aircraft
over Bosnia in 1995, means that western bombers will have a harder
time weaving through the Serbian skies than they do when swooping
over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Bosnia, the Serbs proved to be skilled at electronic
warfare,'' says a British missile-watcher. ``They could tell when
NATO aircraft were targeting their air-defense sites with
anti-radar missiles, and switched off their radar in time to avoid
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's war plan therefore calls for the firing of at least 100
cruise missiles, based at sea or on B-52 aircraft, to mess up the
Serbs' air defenses. Because these projectiles have satellite-based
guidance, they should be even ``smarter'' than they were during the
Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   More accurate still _ so long as the weather is good _ are the
laser-guided bombs that America's stealthy F-117 bombers may
unleash.
</P>
<P>
   And another stealthy giant, the B-2, is having its war debut. If
NATO singles out the heavy armor that is wrecking Kosovo's
villages, it can call on the A-10 ``tank buster'' aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Some veteran Balkan observers believe the Belgrade regime could
crumble as popular anger over the corruption and cynicism of
Milosevic's circle replaces patriotic fervor.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, though, events could spin out of all control. The
rebels of the loosely knit Kosovo Liberation Army may use any
opportunity provided by NATO firepower to take revenge on Serb
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Another worry is that any restraint Serbia might exercise on its
special forces and paramilitary units could be lost if
communication systems are destroyed by bombing.
</P>
<P>
   And Pristina's warren of hillside settlements and communist-era
apartment buildings could become another Beirut. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ Just ten days short of its 50th anniversary, the
Atlantic alliance has gone into battle with a medium-sized European
country, while vowing to protect all other states in the
neighborhood from the fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of starting with pinpricks, dozens of NATO aircraft
began a spectacular bombing campaign on the night of March 24 with
raids on airfields and arms factories near Belgrade, Serbia's
capital, and targets near Pristina, capital of Serbia's already
battered southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise missiles were launched from air and sea. Bombs also fell
on Montenegro _ Serbia's reluctant junior partner in the rump state
of Yugoslavia _ dashing its hopes of being spared.
</P>
<P>
   NATO raids continued on March 25.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Javier Solana, the NATO secretary-general,
had promised on the allies' behalf to ``disrupt'' Yugoslavia's war
against Kosovo's ethnic Albanians and their villages.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the latest repression ordered by Yugoslavia's
president, Slobodan Milosevic, convinced even NATO's doubters _
France, for one _ that something had to be done.
</P>
<P>
   His forces have uprooted at least 65,000 people in the past
month, bringing to 250,000 the number now homeless in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But right from the start there was confusion about NATO's
precise purpose and legal justification.
</P>
<P>
   As the bombs started falling, President Bill Clinton said the
raids were intended to demonstrate NATO's ``opposition to
aggression''; to deter further attacks on civilians; and ``if
necessary'' to damage Serbia's capacity to make war.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the first wave of bombs was intended as a
warning _ and only if it were ignored would NATO start seriously
destroying the Yugoslav arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Solana, for his part, suggested that Serbia was being punished
for its refusal to accept a settlement in Kosovo and let NATO
police it. He also stressed, however, that the alliance ``was not
waging war against Yugoslavia'' and had no quarrel with its (mainly
Serb) people.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the distinction between warnings and war could
vanish from sight if the conflict develops into a broader test of
wills between the western alliance and Serbia's power broker.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's trump cards include vast firepower and fairly solid unity
of purpose in its own ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, for his part, will be banking on his own people's
greater willingness to accept and inflict casualties _ and on the
fact that all nations, even exhausted and divided ones, tend to
rally around the flag when under attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government (which formally speaks for Serbia and an
increasingly restive Montenegro) has given grim warnings to
Romania, Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Macedonia not to take part
``directly or indirectly'' in any NATO actions.
</P>
<P>
   Of these countries, only Hungary (one of three ex-communist ones
to join the alliance last month) is covered by NATO's mutual
defense guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO has told the other four _ plus Slovenia _ that it would
view a Yugoslav attack on them very gravely.
</P>
<P>
   The reassurance is timely: Macedonia is host to 12,000 NATO
troops, in range of Serbian artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO's aircraft revved up their engines, the Yugoslav
leader's first moves were to complete a purge of the security
forces, and silence the voices of domestic opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The army's intelligence chief was replaced by someone even more
loyal; this, combined with the replacement in recent months of the
heads of both the armed forces and the secret service, will dampen
western hopes of a palace coup.
</P>
<P>
   As Belgrade's few remaining lights of independence went out, a
dissident radio station, B-92, was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic can certainly count, at least initially, on support
among his fellow Serbs. Most have no idea of the scale of the
refugee crisis, or the atrocities committed by their police; many
regard Kosovo as a symbol of their history and faith.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Serbia's propaganda has kept many citizens so
cocooned from reality that nobody can predict how they will react
when they realize NATO is not bluffing this time.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's forces are the rusting but still serviceable remnants
of an army that was built up during the Cold War as a defender of
Yugoslavia's non-aligned status. As well as buying Soviet-made
aircraft and air-defenses, the communist state made aircraft, tanks
and ships of its own.
</P>
<P>
   A well-integrated network of surface-to-air missile launchers,
including the mobile SA-6 which brought down an American aircraft
over Bosnia in 1995, means that western bombers will have a harder
time weaving through the Serbian skies than they do when swooping
over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Bosnia, the Serbs proved to be skilled at electronic
warfare,'' says a British missile-watcher. ``They could tell when
NATO aircraft were targeting their air-defense sites with
anti-radar missiles, and switched off their radar in time to avoid
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's war plan therefore calls for the firing of at least 100
cruise missiles, based at sea or on B-52 aircraft, to mess up the
Serbs' air defenses. Because these projectiles have satellite-based
guidance, they should be even ``smarter'' than they were during the
Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   More accurate still _ so long as the weather is good _ are the
laser-guided bombs that America's stealthy F-117 bombers may
unleash.
</P>
<P>
   And another stealthy giant, the B-2, is having its war debut. If
NATO singles out the heavy armor that is wrecking Kosovo's
villages, it can call on the A-10 ``tank buster'' aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Some veteran Balkan observers believe the Belgrade regime could
crumble as popular anger over the corruption and cynicism of
Milosevic's circle replaces patriotic fervor.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, though, events could spin out of all control. The
rebels of the loosely knit Kosovo Liberation Army may use any
opportunity provided by NATO firepower to take revenge on Serb
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Another worry is that any restraint Serbia might exercise on its
special forces and paramilitary units could be lost if
communication systems are destroyed by bombing.
</P>
<P>
   And Pristina's warren of hillside settlements and communist-era
apartment buildings could become another Beirut. &QL;

KINGS' PLAYOFF HOPES GROW DIMMER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ It was a night when the Kings desperately needed to
alter history and desperately needed to upend an unflappable
nemesis that calmly goes about its business.
</P>
<P>
   But some things obviously aren't meant to be for the Kings this
season. And some things don't seem meant to be for this team in any
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings almost definitely will not make the playoffs. And a
winless streak against the Dallas Stars _ which reached 17 games
with a 2-1 loss Thursday night before a Forum crowd of 14,888 _
seems as if it might never end.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't for lack of effort Thursday, however, as the Kings
outshot the Stars 32-26 but dropped to an astonishing 0-11-6
against Dallas, dating back to since Barry Melrose was coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You walk out of a game like that and say, `What else could we
do?''' Kings coach Larry Robinson said following Thursday's loss,
which dropped his team eight points out of a playoff berth with 11
games remaining, eight on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We held the best team in the league to a minimum amount of
chances, we hit posts, we had guys in front. We just didn't put the
puck in the net. But everybody, to a man, played their hearts out.
I don't know what to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Sean O'Donnell added: ``It's tough, but that's what's
tough about sports. We needed two points, we wanted two points, but
what else could we have done? It's better than being outshot 40-20.
At least the effort was there and we can look at ourselves in the
mirror afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   That's probably preferable to glancing at the standings, which
reveal that the Kings (27-39-5) fell eight points behind Calgary
for the final Western Conference playoff berth. The Flames defeated
Montreal on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are 0-5 against Dallas this season, all one-goal
losses, with one meeting remaining. The Stars (45-14-12) didn't
dominate and didn't outplay the Kings but displayed a composure
that explained as well as anything else why they will finish the
regular season with the best record in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings opened the game with a strong shift by the line of
Olli Jokinen, Craig Johnson and Donald Audette, a shift that set
the tone for how the Kings would play but also for the strong
effort by Dallas goalie Roman Turek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we came out and did exactly what we wanted to do,''
defenseman Garry Galley said. ``We wanted to play in their end and
get the puck deep in their end and get our forecheck going and get
some chances at the net, which we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with all the scoring coming in the first two periods, the
Stars sandwiched goals by Benoit Hogue and Brett Hull around one by
Luc Robitaille for the victory. In the third period, the Kings
battled to tie the score, but a shot by Rob Blake hit the crossbar
and one by Sandy Moger hit the right post.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't hit the post and go in,'' Robinson said. ``No, no. It
doesn't want to go in.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson refused to concede that a playoff berth is impossible,
even with his team facing a difficult five-game trip that begins
Sunday at Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do keep working hard, the results are going to come,''
he said. ``We can't have this much bad luck all year. At some
point, it's got to turn around for us.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the trip, he said: ``It's a lot easier going on a big
trip after a huge win. But there's nothing we can do about that. We
have to build on our momentum, and that momentum is we played a
strong game against a great team.''

 ASTRONOMERS BAFFLED BY COSMIC MEGABLAST  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most brilliant and powerful cosmic explosion ever detected
by earthbound astronomers is puzzling scientists around the world,
and many believe its stupendous burst of energy was beamed toward
the Earth in a jet of radiation traveling at nearly the speed of
light.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary blast near the outer edges of the universe was
first detected by two scientific satellites January 23. Its flash
of light was so bright that even a pair of binoculars could have
picked it up faintly for a few fleeting moments, the astronomers
said.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, an automated telescope at Los Alamos, cobbled
together from recycled lenses and used camera components, captured
the first images of the explosion within 22 seconds after the
satellites picked up its signal and transmitted its location
instantaneously over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, both the Hubble space telescope and the giant
Keck instrument atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii were able to photograph
its brilliant afterglow as radiant debris from the blast faded
away.
</P>
<P>
   The blast event, called a gamma ray burster, occurred some 9
billion light-years away, which means that its huge energy took 9
billion years to reach Earth's neighborhood. It appeared to be some
6 million times brighter than a typical exploding star known as a
supernova, but just what caused it remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been a truly monstrous explosion marking the death
of an unusually huge giant star, or a collision between two neutron
stars, or perhaps a single neutron star that emitted tremendous
quantities of energy as the inexorable gravity of a single
super-dense black hole sucked it in. But at this point, such
explanations are only speculations at best, said Alexei Filippenko,
an astronomer at the University of California in Berkeley who has
analyzed many smaller such blasts.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 gamma ray bursters have been reported since the
first one mystified the world's astronomers in 1967, when it was
detected by a fleet of American satellites called Vela Hotel, which
had been flying in orbit over the poles since 1963 to make sure the
Soviets were not conducting illegal secret treaty-busting nuclear
weapons tests in outer space.
</P>
<P>
   But the one detected in January, in the direction of the
well-known constellation Bootes, was by far the most powerful
burster of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It emitted a truly stupendous amount of energy _ millions of
times brighter than a supernova, '' Filippenko said. ``It was a
bright beacon near the edge of the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   The explosion has already generated six scientific reports on
the event, and all were released Thursday by astronomy teams from
15 nations. Three of the reports are being published in the
American journal Science Friday, and three more will appear next
week in the British journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The principal team investigating the fireball event, now dubbed
GRB 990123, is led by Caltech astronomers Shrinivas Kulkarni and S.
George Djorgovski. Carl Akerlof, a physicist at the University of
Michigan, headed the group that captured the first images of the
blast with their improvised telescope at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burst appeared to be more luminous than the whole rest of
the universe, and that would be very hard to explain by most
current theories,'' Kulkarni said Thursday. And if the explosion
spewed its gamma rays out in all directions, Djorgovski added,
``their energy would correspond to 10,000 times the energy emitted
by our sun over its entire lifetime so far.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a commentary on the discovery that will appear next week
in the journal Nature, astrophysicist Peter Meszaros of
Pennsylvania State University said there is ``reasonable evidence''
that the explosion had beamed its energy only in Earth's direction,
which would mean that the blast was less powerful than the Caltech
scientists estimated _ although it was still most probably stronger
than any cosmic event yet known since the Big Bang gave birth to
the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Djorgovski, however, insisted in an interview that there is no
real evidence yet for any ``beaming'' of the explosion's energy,
nor for a beam from the quickly dying but still brilliant afterglow
melange of gamma rays, X-rays and radio waves that followed the
first blast.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliance of the afterglow, he said, might possibly have
been boosted in all directions by a jet of incandescent gases
thrusting outward from the blast at nearly the speed of light.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any event,'' he said, ``we have no theory to account for
it, but if we don't know how it's done, then it's obvious that
nature does know how because our telescopes saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only last May that a similar brilliant gamma ray burster
was detected by instruments aboard the same two satellites that
found the January one, and the May event was considered the most
powerful burst ever detected.
</P>
<P>
   This one was even stronger, and the Italian-Dutch satellite
called BeppoSax located its first burst, while America's orbiting
Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory caught caught the radiation at almost
the same time. The two satellites pinpointed the blast's direction
and relayed their signals instantly via the Internet to the
automated telescope at Los Alamos. That instrument then swivelled
its optics without a human hand to guide it and locked onto the
light of the explosion within 10 seconds, just as the blast's
brilliance was peaking.

<P>
   TOULOUSE _ When it comes to new products, few businesses are
more perilous than making civil aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Airplanes cost billions to develop and are designed to last a
generation. Boeing bet the company when it launched the 747,
spending $2 billion on the project, 2 times the value of the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Twice as big and efficient as anything else in the air, the
jumbo jet has earned the Seattle company over $20 billion in
profits since it first flew, 30 years ago almost to the day.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's rivals, Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas, bet heavily too
_ and lost. Their wide-body jets, the Tristar and the DC-10, never
earned a penny.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981 Lockheed quit the civil-jet business altogether; two
years ago McDonnell Douglas was taken over by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Had either of them developed a twin-engined wide-body aircraft,
it would have avoided head-on competition with the 747, and might
have prevented Airbus from getting off the ground. Instead, over
the past 20 years the European consortium has encroached on
Boeing's dominant market share.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing used to account for well over two-thirds of orders, but
now it is being challenged in most parts of the market by Airbus.
Boeing reigns supreme only with the largest 747s.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Airbus had been content to attack the 747 from
below, with bigger versions of its long-range A340. The latest,
soon to go into production, can carry 385 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Virgin Atlantic will have an A340 with bedrooms below the main
deck, where passengers can sleep on the night flight that it is
starting between London and Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   But Airbus, led by Noel Forgeard, hired from the French private
sector last year, is determined also to launch an attack from
above.
</P>
<P>
   Forgeard reasons that air traffic is growing by 5 percent a year
and that crowded airport hubs will need bigger aircraft. He reckons
that over the next 20 years there is a market for 1,400
``super-jumbos'' that are equipped to carry 550-660 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 20 airlines, half of them in Asia, are seen as
potential customers and only 10 percent of the total number of
planes would be super-jumbos. But they would be worth 25 percent of
the market, or $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hence Airbus, which is owned by France's Aerospatiale, Germany's
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, British Aerospace and Spain's CASA, is
stepping up work on its super-jumbo, the A3XX.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the partners and the consortium headquarters in Toulouse
have 1,000 staff working on the design of this huge double-decker.
And Airbus lobbyists are starting to ask their governments for
loans to help launch the aircraft. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 450) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of the $10 billion that it will cost to get the A3XX off the
ground, a third is supposed to come from Airbus; a third from
associates, including Italy's Alenia, Sweden's Saab Aircraft and
(Forgeard hopes) a Japanese company; and the remaining third from
European governments.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement signed with the United States in 1992,
governments can finance up to that proportion of the launch cost of
a new aircraft. In return, indirect government aid to Boeing,
through defense contracts with civilian spin-offs, is meant to be
limited to 3 percent of turnover.
</P>
<P>
   The Airbus launch aid is repayable at commercial interest rates
as the aircraft are sold. But it is still a subsidy, because it
would cost Airbus far more to raise finance on the market. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thus the paper A3XX could, at last, become real. Forgeard thinks
he will have an aircraft to sell to airlines by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to win the first orders by the end of 2000, at which
point Airbus could start production. But the launch timetable has
slipped, as nervousness about the slump in Asian travel has given
airlines cold feet. The earliest an A3XX could take wing now would
be 2005. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the project faces other hurdles. The money-conscious
British and German governments increasingly take the view that
Airbus should fly by itself.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, they would be happier financing Airbus if it had
the clarity of a company, rather than the obscurity of the
groupement d'interet economique (GIE), its current status under
French law.
</P>
<P>
   Conversion was supposed to happen in January, but squabbling
over valuations, shareholdings and control brought the process to
an embarrassing halt in October.
</P>
<P>
   The fault lies mainly with the French partner, Aerospatiale _
though its partial privatization in June, when it is merging into
part of the Lagardere Group, might help.
</P>
<P>
   Forgeard is visibly irritated at the delay, but the soonest he
can expect a conversion into a proper company is now the autumn of
next year.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only governments who are unhappy. Under the GIE
structure, all partners are jointly liable for all the total risks
assumed by Airbus. The Airbus partners, which will mostly be big
defense aerospace firms once Aerospatiale is part of Lagardere,
might prefer the more certain returns of defense projects to a big
and risky civil bet. &QL;

<P>
   One of the strongest signs that the A3XX will overcome these
obstacles comes from Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The firm believes that air travel is fragmenting, with most
growth coming not on the big trunk routes that connect crowded
hubs, but from long-haul point-to-point services, such as Singapore
to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Such ``long, thin routes,'' as they are known, are best served
by 300-400 seaters such as the A340 or Boeing's 777.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph Baseler, Boeing's boss of commercial-aircraft
marketing, says that increasingly liberal bilateral air-traffic
deals have boosted these routes. He thinks Pacific air travel may
become like Atlantic travel, where many flights bypass such hubs as
London's Heathrow.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years Boeing has maintained that there was not
enough demand to justify spending $16 billion on a replacement for
the jumbo.
</P>
<P>
   It has dismissed Airbus's forecast for super-jumbos, and cut its
estimate by 100 aircraft, to 350 aircraft over 20 years _ though it
takes a narrower view of the market, counting only demand for
something bigger than the 747. (Airbus, by contrast, sees its A3XX
replacing the 747 too.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite these differences, Boeing is now looking at ways of
stretching and updating the 747. It is also quietly reexamining an
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago Boeing touted simple stretch versions of the
747, but airlines were not interested; they wanted an aircraft that
would offer big savings, not just more seats. Now, thanks to
technology that it acquired with McDonnell Douglas, Boeing can use
better wing-aerodynamics to save 7 percent on fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Its engineers are looking at a 550-seat 747, which would employ
the fly-by-wire technology pioneered by Airbus. Such a remake would
still cost several billion dollars; but it would be cheaper than a
new aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The best explanation for Boeing's change of heart is the A3XX.
Even Virgin, which has pursued a strategy of creating a network of
thin routes, sees the need for a super-jumbo to ease congestion at
hub airports.
</P>
<P>
   Other airlines are more enthusiastic still. When the Asian
market caused the launch date to slip, Virgin's arch-rival, British
Airways, one of the airlines closest to the A3XX, sought
reassurance from Airbus that the consortium was not about to go
cool on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing needs to boost productivity and repair its margins before
embarking on any big investments. Since it got its factories into a
tangle two years ago Boeing's profits and share price have both
tumbled.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing delays in converting Airbus into a proper company
might be just the opportunity it needs. After all, any delay in the
A3XX provides Boeing with more years of near-monopoly profits.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Airbus should bet the company now. The trouble is, it
doesn't have a proper company to bet. &QL;

   TOULOUSE _ When it comes to new products, few businesses are
more perilous than making civil aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Airplanes cost billions to develop and are designed to last a
generation. Boeing bet the company when it launched the 747,
spending $2 billion on the project, 2 times the value of the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Twice as big and efficient as anything else in the air, the
jumbo jet has earned the Seattle company over $20 billion in
profits since it first flew, 30 years ago almost to the day.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's rivals, Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas, bet heavily too
_ and lost. Their wide-body jets, the Tristar and the DC-10, never
earned a penny.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981 Lockheed quit the civil-jet business altogether; two
years ago McDonnell Douglas was taken over by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Had either of them developed a twin-engined wide-body aircraft,
it would have avoided head-on competition with the 747, and might
have prevented Airbus from getting off the ground. Instead, over
the past 20 years the European consortium has encroached on
Boeing's dominant market share.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing used to account for well over two-thirds of orders, but
now it is being challenged in most parts of the market by Airbus.
Boeing reigns supreme only with the largest 747s.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Airbus had been content to attack the 747 from
below, with bigger versions of its long-range A340. The latest,
soon to go into production, can carry 385 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Virgin Atlantic will have an A340 with bedrooms below the main
deck, where passengers can sleep on the night flight that it is
starting between London and Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   But Airbus, led by Noel Forgeard, hired from the French private
sector last year, is determined also to launch an attack from
above.
</P>
<P>
   Forgeard reasons that air traffic is growing by 5 percent a year
and that crowded airport hubs will need bigger aircraft. He reckons
that over the next 20 years there is a market for 1,400
``super-jumbos'' that are equipped to carry 550-660 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 20 airlines, half of them in Asia, are seen as
potential customers and only 10 percent of the total number of
planes would be super-jumbos. But they would be worth 25 percent of
the market, or $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hence Airbus, which is owned by France's Aerospatiale, Germany's
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, British Aerospace and Spain's CASA, is
stepping up work on its super-jumbo, the A3XX.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the partners and the consortium headquarters in Toulouse
have 1,000 staff working on the design of this huge double-decker.
And Airbus lobbyists are starting to ask their governments for
loans to help launch the aircraft. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 450) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of the $10 billion that it will cost to get the A3XX off the
ground, a third is supposed to come from Airbus; a third from
associates, including Italy's Alenia, Sweden's Saab Aircraft and
(Forgeard hopes) a Japanese company; and the remaining third from
European governments.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement signed with the United States in 1992,
governments can finance up to that proportion of the launch cost of
a new aircraft. In return, indirect government aid to Boeing,
through defense contracts with civilian spin-offs, is meant to be
limited to 3 percent of turnover.
</P>
<P>
   The Airbus launch aid is repayable at commercial interest rates
as the aircraft are sold. But it is still a subsidy, because it
would cost Airbus far more to raise finance on the market. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thus the paper A3XX could, at last, become real. Forgeard thinks
he will have an aircraft to sell to airlines by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to win the first orders by the end of 2000, at which
point Airbus could start production. But the launch timetable has
slipped, as nervousness about the slump in Asian travel has given
airlines cold feet. The earliest an A3XX could take wing now would
be 2005. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the project faces other hurdles. The money-conscious
British and German governments increasingly take the view that
Airbus should fly by itself.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, they would be happier financing Airbus if it had
the clarity of a company, rather than the obscurity of the
groupement d'interet economique (GIE), its current status under
French law.
</P>
<P>
   Conversion was supposed to happen in January, but squabbling
over valuations, shareholdings and control brought the process to
an embarrassing halt in October.
</P>
<P>
   The fault lies mainly with the French partner, Aerospatiale _
though its partial privatization in June, when it is merging into
part of the Lagardere Group, might help.
</P>
<P>
   Forgeard is visibly irritated at the delay, but the soonest he
can expect a conversion into a proper company is now the autumn of
next year.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only governments who are unhappy. Under the GIE
structure, all partners are jointly liable for all the total risks
assumed by Airbus. The Airbus partners, which will mostly be big
defense aerospace firms once Aerospatiale is part of Lagardere,
might prefer the more certain returns of defense projects to a big
and risky civil bet. &QL;

 CONUNDRUM IN THE SUN: THE SWIRLING CONTRADICTIONS OF CUBA  &HT;     By LESLIE GUTTMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  I am trying to walk like a Cubana: hips on ball bearings,
swaying beneath the straight, proud torso of a dancer. italI am a
queen. I am in no rush. Check me out.ital
<P>
   But it's no use. I can't get it, no matter how much I study the
women of Havana. Maybe if I stayed a year I'd learn, but I am only
here a couple of weeks, in a country that the United States has for
four decades considered the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   I am here to see the face of the enemy and what I am supposed to
fear.
</P>
<P>
   The face of the enemy is black, white, mulatto, an
Afro-Cuban-Spanish-European-Asian garden of wild beauty. The face
has a range of expressions, changeable as tropical weather, calm to
sunny to stormy. But the expression I see most, on the streets, in
stores, on bicycles, and while waiting for the giant pink and blue
semis-turned-buses called ``camellos'' (camels) is resignation. It
is a hardness, like a 10-centavo Cuban roll, from the frustration
of trying to survive in an economy that keeled over when the Soviet
Union did.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone hunts for U.S. dollars, the currency of the lucky ones,
whose hands touch the silken cloak of the tourist. An average
month's salary in Cuban pesos (less than $15) can barely buy three
weeks of food in a month, and stuff, good stuff _ Lycra bodysuits,
Rollerblades, Italian underwear _ can only be bought in dollars.
And Cuban youth want good stuff. That doesn't mean Payless shoes, a
top government economist tells me.
</P>
<P>
   A Cuban friend tells me the entire country could be bought for a
couple of million pairs of Levis. I think the whole place is being
held together with duct tape and Krazy Glue, sent from a relative
in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   At the cemetery, a teenager is buried in a cardboard coffin.
Miguel, an esteemed union president I meet, wears a frayed woman's
gold nylon jacket salvaged from a donation box. In the graceful,
tree-lined neighborhood of Vedado, a crumbled pile of pink Italian
marble from another collapsed home lies underneath a ceiba tree. I
pick up a small piece shaped like a jagged heart to take home.
</P>
<P>
   I sit with my 19-year-old friend Carmen, a music student and
singer, on the Malecon, the sea wall on the edge of Havana. With
the crash of the waves to cover our conversation, she tells me that
if a jealous neighbor suspects she got her white and yellow Reeboks
through prostitution _ which she did not _ one phone call will send
her to jail. She tells me of three journalists jailed for
publishing a magazine protesting prison conditions for dissidents.
At 19, she has the face of someone who is scared she is a rose that
may never bloom.
</P>
<P>
   At the baseball game, record-breaking Livan ``El Duque''
Hernandez has been obliterated from the stats book for bailing the
country for the United States and the Florida Marlins by boat.
Across Havana, a listlessness hangs in the air like a wet towel.
Everyone seems to be waiting for something that may never happen in
their lifetime. The price of a night out is too high for most
Cubans, who can only watch, from the sidewalk, tourists dancing in
clubs or listening to music or having nice dinners. The Cubans have
the faces of people who can still remember what good food tastes
like.
</P>
<P>
   On a dark, potholed lane in Central Havana, a man in a black
T-shirt and baseball cap pushes me and tries unsuccessfully to grab
my purse before running off. Later, in bed, I think about how he
didn't yank the strap very hard, almost as if the attempt was
half-hearted, tired. If there is to be a civil war when Fidel goes,
as some say, it cannot happen on Monday, Wednesday or Friday nights
at 9:30, when the weary country is transfixed by the lives of
Gaviota and Sebastian in the telenovela ``Cafe con Aroma de
Mujer.'' The empty streets echo with the choir of hundreds of TV
sets.
</P>
<P>
   I try to call home and find out service has been disconnected
between the United States and Cuba over delayed payments to the
Cuban telephone provider by American telephone companies. I get a
taste of what it is like to be cut off from the world. I understand
a little better why I am constantly quizzed about my life and the
United States: ``Are the hills in San Francisco really like they
look in the movies?'' ``How much money do you make?'' ``What is
Brooke Shields doing with her life?'' ``Can you tell me all the
words, in English, to Patsy Cline's `Crazy'?''
</P>
<P>
   Every tourist I meet on my journey says the same thing: ``We
wanted to come now, before things opened up, before you can get a
Happy Meal in Old Havana.'' Everyone wants to look into the crystal
ball to see what the marriage of Cuba and hard-core tourism will
bring.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of a flash rainstorm, my bus turns off the Malecon
to find a road that's not flooded. We lumber past a Cuban guy
trying to fix his battered beige car, a Russian Lada, stuck in the
heavy rain. As we pass, I see a tourist jump out of his shiny,
white rent-a-car a couple of feet in front of the broken-down Lada.
He runs in front of it and snaps a picture. Then he heads back to
his car and zooms off. It doesn't occur to him to help.
</P>
<P>
   Che Guevara is ubiquitous, his movie-star face on posters,
murals, billboards and T-shirts. He is a hero, a keychain, a saint
in fatigues. I meet a noted surgeon, an older gentleman who lost
his private clinic and his wealth after the Revolution, but who
speaks of his life without regret or bitterness. We sit talking in
his garden under his treasured mango trees. He gives me a
three-peso coin with Che's face on it and tells me to save it.
``Every country needs a dreamer,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   I meet Cubans who want to stay in Cuba, and I meet Cubans
desperate to leave. The latter talk to me in low voices about
longing to own their futures. The believers in the Revolution move
me when they talk of fruits of its harvest: the near-perfect
literacy and infant mortality rates, the free education and health
care, a country where the old are never abandoned. And still others
tell me, frustrated over the U.S. embargo and the country's
internal economic policy: What good is free education if you can't
afford textbooks? Or health care with no medicine?
</P>
<P>
   But everyone is proud of the promise that no child go to bed
hungry and forgotten. In two weeks, I have never heard an infant
cry. I have never seen an unhappy child. They walk in laughing
packs of every age through the streets, strong, self-assured,
beloved. A 7-year-old girl can hitchhike home in the dark with no
fear.
</P>
<P>
   What is the most intriguing for me, coming from the United
States of Prozac, is that while the Cubans that I meet are unhappy,
frustrated, down about the economic disintegration of their
country, they still know how to laugh, have a good time, make an
instant friend from a stranger and a party out of bottle of rum and
a salsa tape.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have the microwaves, computers and VCRs Americans
have, but they also don't have the poverty of the spirit, the kind
that comes from waking up lonely in a studio apartment, or spending
a Christmas holiday with no family, or trying to keep up with the
Joneses, whom you've lived next door to for five years and have
never even met.
</P>
<P>
   Around midnight, a friend and I walk out of a concert hall to
find the musicians we had seen inside standing on a median in the
middle of a tree-lined street in Nuevo Vedado. They start playing,
and we start dancing, along with about 20 other people on the
cracked asphalt, into the warm night.
</P>
<P>
   On a breezy, late afternoon, a grandmother pulls me and another
gringa friend into her 19th-century home after seeing us admire,
through her half-open door, her collection of six-foot-tall dolls
dressed up like saints in glittering gold and blue. We spend the
afternoon talking about men, love and family, and looking at her
photo albums. We look at picture after picture of three
generations, aunts, uncles, sisters, brothers, sons, daughters. Not
one, that I can see, is the face of the enemy.
</P>

KICKERS WITHOUT CARTILAGE : SOCCER'S WALKING WOUNDED The legions of
soccer invalids -- soccer players who have suffered career-ending
injuries -- are growing rapidly. Profit-oriented teams are under
intense pressure to keep their good players, regardless of their
injuries. Team doctors are encouraged to do whatever they can to
keep injured players on the field, even at the risk of longer-term
injury and if they do not, the doctors are fired. Making matters
worse, the number of matches played each year seems to be
constantly rising. By Veronika Hackenbroch. From Der Spiegel. 1,000

 &UR; UNDER THE BEDS OF THE REDS
</P>
<P>
   BY PAUL BERMAN
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The great untold story of the 20th century, even now, after so
many books and memoirs, is the story of the heroic anti-Communist
left -- the romance of leftists and radical trade unionists who
recognized that Communism was a catastrophic byproduct of their own
movement, and who mobilized themselves, before anyone else thought
to do so, to bring the Communists down. And in that great untold
tale, surely no one played a stranger or more dramatic role than
the slightly scary Jay Lovestone, the Machiavelli of Machiavellis.
</P>
<P>
   As Ted Morgan tells us in ``A Covert Life,'' Lovestone
(1897-1990) was a sturdy son of City College, the president of the
student Socialist club, who abandoned Socialism after World War I
to help found America's Communist movement. He was shrewd,
confident, talented, energetic and unscrupulous, and by the age of
29 he was the top leader of the country's Communist Party. But
there he made a fateful error. During the late 1920's the leaders
of Soviet Communism were busily trying to get rid of one another in
Moscow, and Lovestone sided with his friend Nikolai I. Bukharin,
who lost the battle, instead of with Stalin, who won. Lovestone and
his comrades from the United States rushed to Moscow in a heat of
factional fury, and Stalin ordered that Lovestone, as an ally of
Bukharin, be kept in Russia -- doubtless in order to have him
killed at a convenient moment.
</P>
<P>
   But Lovestone got hold of a passport and a plane ticket and
escaped with his life, and when he got back to New York he tried to
rally America's Communists to side with his own leadership against
Stalin's. Naturally, he failed. American Communism was strictly a
puppet of the Soviet Union, and Lovestone was duly expelled from
his own party. He refused to accept the expulsion, though, and
instead organized a tiny faction loyal to himself, known formally
and grandiosely as the Communist Party (Majority Group), and
informally as the Lovestonites. And he and his followers went on
regarding themselves as the legitimate Communists, with Bukharin as
their international guide. Lovestone's faction had some strength,
too -- two or three brainy intellectuals, some well-placed allies
among the old-fashioned labor Socialists and anarchists, and a
solid base among the dressmakers of the International Ladies
Garment Workers Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Lovestonites were backroom maneuverers. The whole of their
strategy was to wait patiently for Bukharin to return to power in
Moscow, perhaps at Stalin's side, in the expectation that Bukharin
would restore his own comrades to their rightful places at the head
of Communist parties around the world. Meanwhile, the Lovestonites
did everything they could to keep the mainstream Communists in the
United States from taking over the trade unions. They fought a
thousand nasty battles. Then, in Moscow in 1938, Bukharin was shot.
Lovestone and his comrades gave up on their last illusions about
Communism. And from that moment on they devoted themselves to
fighting the Soviet Union and Communists everywhere they could, no
longer in the interest of achieving a better Communism but in the
interest of securing the independence of trade unions.
</P>
<P>
   The battles took place among the needle trades workers of New
York and the auto workers of Detroit, where the American Communists
had some power. But in the 1940's, with the backing of the garment
workers union and the American Federation of Labor, Lovestone and a
handful of his followers brought their campaign to Europe. The
political situation there was dangerous in the extreme. The
Communist parties of Germany, France and Italy came out of World
War II with a real strength, especially in the unions, and it was
entirely possible that with a few lucky breaks and enough Russian
support those parties might come to power, just as Communist
parties were doing farther to the east. The United States
Government had not yet decided to put up a systematic resistance.
The Central Intelligence Agency did not yet exist. And in those
circumstances, Lovestone and his righthand man, Irving Brown (the
``scholar pumpernickel,'' as he was called), set up the first
effective American effort to undermine the European Communists.
</P>
<P>
   They quietly sought out Socialist and Roman Catholic trade
unionists, plus a few shady Marseilles gangster-longshoremen, and
supplied them with enough money from the American Federation of
Labor to break away from the Communist unions and organize labor
federations of their own. Morgan describes those postwar efforts as
``Lovestone's finest hour.'' Doubtless they were. For if Lovestone
and his comrades had failed to extend a fraternal solidarity to the
European trade unionists, how much stronger would the Communist
parties have become? Quite a lot, possibly.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 40's the United States Government did gear up for
the cold war, the C.I.A. was organized, and Lovestone's secret
agency crossed over into the darker zones of Government conspiracy.
He and his network of agents, now all over the world, remained
under the official authority of the A.F.L. and then the united
A.F.L.-C.I.O., and at the same time were paid on the sly by a
probably illegal fund administered by the C.I.A.'s daffy director
of counterintelligence, James Jesus Angleton. Exactly who
controlled Lovestone's activities over the next decades was not
always clear. At different times, as Morgan writes, the
A.F.L.-C.I.O., the F.B.I. and even the C.I.A. had no idea what
Lovestone was up to. Some of his undertakings look attractive
enough, in retrospect. During the 1950's, the State Department
tended to support the British and French imperialists in their
last-ditch efforts to salvage the old European empires around the
world. But Lovestone was strictly anticolonialist, notably in
regard to North Africa, where he supported Algeria's National
Liberation Front against the French.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he kept up a pointless war against his rivals from
the American labor movement, especially Walter Reuther's brother,
Victor, who ran an anti-Communist international labor program of
his own -- and ran it with a surer instinct than Lovestone for
keeping labor's image and ideals intact. During the Vietnam war,
the Reuther brothers came to recognize, after a while, that the
United States ought to withdraw. But Lovestone was up to his neck
in promoting the labor movement in South Vietnam and was incapable
of noticing that the war had turned into a disaster. There was
always something fanatical about Jay Lovestone. In his eyes, the
hour was always late and the time for desperate measures was always
at hand. His spying got sillier over time. Still, it's cheering to
learn from Morgan that in Lovestone's last years before lapsing
into senility, he retained enough independence of mind to sputter
with rage when President Ronald Reagan broke the air traffic
controller's strike.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan is a popular, not a scholarly, biographer, and there are
moments in ``A Covert Life,'' in discussing the arcana of the left
and the unions, when he gets out of his depth. He tells us nothing
about Lovestonite meddlings in the trade unions of Latin America,
where the outcome may have been less than pleasant; and nothing
about the Lovestonites in the civil rights movement, where the
story was rather honorable. He says almost nothing about the
Lovestonites as an intellectual movement. Will Herberg, the Jewish
theologian, and Bertram D. Wolfe, the historian, were Lovestonites
during the 30's, and they and Lovestone himself gave to their tiny
faction a touch of genuine intellectual sophistication. Sidney Hook
once told me that Lovestone's faction may have secretly controlled
Modern Monthly in the 30's, which preceded Partisan Review as a
home for the New York intellectuals. It was the Lovestonites who
coined the phrase ``American exceptionalism,'' based on a phrase of
Bukharin's, to express their notion that America's labor movement
ought to pursue its own course, and not follow any one else's
model.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan does tell an amazing tale, though, filled with astounding
characters. There is the sensational case of Louise Page Morris, a
fashion model from a Boston Brahmin family, who spent 25 years as
Lovestone's lover, working for him and for Angleton of the C.I.A.
as a secret agent in Iraq and the Middle East -- a woman of real
derring-do, who, ever sneaky, merrily two-timed Lovestone with
Henry Cabot Lodge, President Dwight D. Eisenhower's envoy to the
United Nations. And yet the most sensational of Morgan's characters
is plainly Lovestone himself, the conspirator who, ``working behind
the scenes and out of the limelight, in an office in the I.L.G.W.U.
headquarters in New York,'' became, in Morgan's phrase, ``one of
the masterminds of the Cold War.'' He was the man whom Stalin
almost nabbed -- the man who just barely got out of Moscow and who,
in the name of the American working class, spent the rest of his
life exacting revenge, big time, on Stalin and the Soviet Union.

 &UR; THE WILD ONES
</P>
<P>
   BY ROY HOFFMAN
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AS enchanting at times as a Chagall mural, at others as
overdrawn as an old Yiddish melodrama, ``The River Midnight''
conjures up Blaszka, a fictional Polish shtetl of the 1890's, and
the interwoven stories of four of its women. In their youth, they
were known as the vilda hayas, ``the wild creatures.'' Now
approaching middle age, they still confound their village -- and
especially their men -- with a little craziness.
</P>
<P>
   Childless Hanna-Leah, long married to the hapless butcher,
Hershel, is tempted early in the novel by a ghostly refugee she
meets in the woods, a self-described ``traveler'' fleeing the
draft. Her best friend, Faygela, has traded her hopes for a bookish
life to marry well-meaning Shmuel, the baker, and bear him six
children. But after going to Warsaw to care for an ailing relative,
Faygela is inspired by the city's intellectual life and returns
home to publish stories about the shtetl sisterhood. ``A real
writer tells the truth,'' she declares, dismissing a man who churns
out popular Yiddish romances, ``and that's how he changes the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   A fondly remembered friend, Zisa-Sara, has died with her husband
in a garment factory fire in New York, but her daughter, Emma,
returns to the village, radicalized by this tragedy. Coming of age
in Blaszka, she strikes up a friendship with Faygela's oldest
daughter, Ruthie.
</P>
<P>
   The most engaging of the vilda hayas, Misha, the midwife, is
defiantly nobody's wife. She is divorced from Hayim, the water
carrier, and is now expecting a child, fathered either by the
lovelorn rabbi, Berekh, or by the violently drunken peddler,
Yarush.
</P>
<P>
   Dynamic women, feckless men -- this fin de sicle novel often
sounds as if it were set in the 1990's, not the 1890's: '' 'I'm
going to be independent like Misha was before she got herself into
trouble. And who brought her down?' Ruthie asked agitatedly.
'Nobody knows for sure, but it wasn't an angel, I can tell you. It
was some man.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lilian Nattel, the Montreal-born daughter of emigres from
Poland, says in an author's note that her family's stories,
bolstered by her own research, formed the basis for the novel. She
even provides a welcome bibliography for further reading. Not
surprisingly, ``The River Midnight'' has the ring of authenticity,
from its vibrant depiction of the shtetl to its elaboration of
Misha's role as midwife. But, unfortunately, persuasive fiction
does not live by authenticity alone.
</P>
<P>
   NATTEL writes with refreshing bawdiness about the vilda hayas,
but she shies away from delving into the complex relationship
between Emma and Ruthie, veiling its eroticism in somewhat tangled
language: ``Ruthie laughed and Emma wasn't quite sure if she fell
accidentally or on purpose, pulling Emma with her, but soon the
girls were drenched, braids undone, their shifts transparent, water
dripping like a fountain from their chins, and when Ruthie drank
from Emma's fountain, she had to laugh and scream and push Ruthie
away, her hands tingling strangely where they had touched Ruthie's
chest.''
</P>
<P>
   Although her characters are meant to be speaking Yiddish,
Nattel's dialogue includes little that is distinctive, rhythmically
or syntactically. Instead, it favors the generic vernacular of too
many historical novels; while informative, it lacks the true flavor
of a particular place. Because Nattel often uses imagery to lush
effect -- invoking, say, ``the fruity perfume of summer darkness''
-- it is especially disappointing that she also leans on cliches. A
jerry-built sentence, a leached metaphor, an overwrought gesture --
to point out such flaws in light of Nattel's larger accomplishment
may seem like quibbling, but their effect is to yank the reader out
of the fictional dream.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, perhaps through Nattel's sheer love for these
characters, that dream holds on. As an artist, she is like Hayim,
who is scolded by his adoptive father, Asher: ``I'm telling you
plain, everything is God. Are you looking, Hayim? Are you using
your eyes? The Baal Shem Tov, of blessed memory, spent days in the
fields and the woods, and there he saw the Holy One arising from
every living thing and also the stones.''
</P>
<P>
   When Asher goes blind, Hayim dutifully tells him about his daily
rounds: ``Do you think, Hayim asked hesitantly, I saw the Holy
Presence? 'Don't stop looking, Hayim,' Asher said.''
</P>
<P>
   With fervor, and intermittent moments of revelation, Hayim
persists. And so does Lilian Nattel.

 SINGING THE CITY
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bonds of Home in an Industrial Landscape.
</P>
<P>
   By Laurie Graham.
</P>
<P>
   University of Pittsburgh Press. $22.95.
</P>
<P>
   ------
 &UR; STEELER
</P>
<P>
   BY HOLLY BRUBACH
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The particular landscape that serves as the backdrop for our
childhood -- the topography, the buildings, the trees, the light --
imprints itself forever on our memory: it is the norm with which we
will compare every landscape we encounter for the rest of our
lives. Laurie Graham goes so far as to contend that a landscape can
work its way into our DNA. Hence, she claims in ``Singing the
City,'' her sense of coming home when she moved to Pittsburgh,
where previous generations of her family had lived -- though she
herself had grown up in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   With the death of her husband in 1989 when she was not quite 50,
Graham vowed to make a fresh start. Leaving New York and her job as
an editor at Scribner, she moved to Pittsburgh, where she fell in
love -- first with the industrial culture that she found there and
soon after with a former steelworker. Her chronicle of the early,
halting stages of their courtship is intertwined with an account of
the demise of Big Steel and its profound effect on the lives of
people for whom the mills provided the foundations of community.
Graham is evenhanded in distributing the blame. The devastation,
she argues, is not only economic but moral, and it extends to other
American cities -- Buffalo, Youngstown, Cleveland, Baltimore,
Chicago -- that are likewise faced with the decline of heavy
industry.
</P>
<P>
   This book is perhaps best appreciated in the context of two
others about Pittsburgh: ``An American Childhood,'' Annie Dillard's
superb memoir of her early years in Squirrel Hill, a prosperous
neighborhood within the city limits, and ``American Elegy,''
Jeffrey Simpson's eloquent investigation into his family's life in
Parnassus, a small town in Pittsburgh's shadow. Both Dillard and
Simpson chronicle the peculiarities of the relentless Calvinism
that held sway among descendants of the city's early settlers,
Scotch-Irish immigrants who established a Presbyterian stronghold
and emerged as the ruling class. Graham rounds out the picture by
delineating the work ethic of the city's minorities, mostly Eastern
European and Roman Catholic. While Dillard's and Simpson's
reminiscences are rooted in the sediment of personal memory,
Graham's portrayal relies for its depth on other people's
recollections.
</P>
<P>
   As a newcomer to the city, she interviews longtime residents of
neighborhoods like Polish Hill and Homestead, in which the bonds of
church and family are inextricably tied to the virtues of manual
labor. ``Blue-collar people think that if you don't want to work
you get a desk job,'' Graham's new husband, Bob, explains. She
champions those who have stayed where they were born and
perpetuated the values they inherited, among them Sharon Wolkiewicz
and her mother, Helen. ``Helen says she is 'embedded here,' ''
Graham reports. Sharon asks, ``How could you just move away and
call another place home?''
</P>
<P>
   Graham introduces the reader to Diane Novosel, the granddaughter
of Croatian and Romanian immigrants, who ``dropped out'' in her
early 20's; she ``tried popular culture and it wasn't enough.''
Novosel is now the head of the Society for the Preservation of the
Murals of St. Nicholas, a church in Millvale whose interior is
painted with scenes that conflate peasant life in rural Croatia,
Bible stories and the Homestead strike of 1892, coming to the
rescue of a local past that many natives -- myself included -- have
taken for granted if not dismissed altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh I grew up in -- a Pittsburgh that predates
Graham's arrival by some 30 years -- was the proud capital of vast
business empires, the headquarters for United States Steel, Alcoa,
Westinghouse, Gulf Oil and Pittsburgh Plate Glass. All its
prominent features -- the smokestacks, the skyscrapers and trestle
bridges, the highways cut into the rock face, the strip-mined
cliffs, the row houses that climb the mountainsides like stairs --
attested to hard work. The peculiar gray cast of the light served
only to intensify the lingering impression of dinginess,
attributable not to neglect but to the climate of diligence and
moral austerity.
</P>
<P>
   Beauty resided elsewhere -- in Ligonier's rolling countryside 50
miles to the east or in New York's glittering skyline or in
pastoral France, which had supplied the raw material for
masterpieces by Monet and Cezanne. Pittsburgh had been immortalized
by its own painter, John Kane, and as a young art student I
remember thinking what a shame it was that he had squandered his
obvious talents on a place where there was nothing to look at.
</P>
<P>
   Within the past 20 years, in Pittsburgh and elsewhere, train
stations have been converted to shopping malls and factories to
residential lofts. The industrial esthetic now reigns supreme in
everything from museum architecture to bathroom fixtures;
Pittsburgh's brand of beauty, resplendent in things whose forms
have been entirely dictated by their functions, has come into its
own -- just as those things are being rendered obsolete. On
occasion, Graham's appreciation for Pittsburgh's history is
subsumed by acute nostalgia for a time before the layoffs and the
closings, when the ``bonds of home'' referred to in the subtitle
were still intact.
</P>
<P>
   The desire to go backward, rowing against the currents of
change, the longing for an enclave in which the old order still
prevails, seem benign enough until this tribute to manual labor
strays into the realm of men's supremacy and their entitlement.
Graham quotes the ``poet and steelworker'' Tim Russell: ``There is
something great about sitting in an easy chair, next to your father
in his easy chair, eating a plate of food, watching a bowl game on
TV. It isn't the food or the game that matters but the extreme bond
of family. . . . Men are in front of the firelight of the TV, women
are in the kitchen comparing notes about kids. It's a good thing
knowing you have that place.'' I guess it must be. I wouldn't know.
I was washing the dishes.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer physicality of the labor that Graham extols culminates
in the image of surging molten steel as a metaphor for sexual
potency. Indeed, ``Singing the City'' is a veritable anthem to
virility. The Pittsburgh it portrays is a mythic town, the furnace
of the gods stoked by plain-spoken blue-collar guys with good
hearts. The furnace is cold now, the guys at a loss. To cure what
ails us, Graham would rekindle those fires.

 &UR; IT'S NO FUN BEING NORMAL
</P>
<P>
   BY KAREN KARBO
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ALL nine of the potent stories in ``Survival Rates'' share a
setting: the desert Southwest and parts of California so far south
that the freeway signs announce the approach of the Mexican border.
The desert, as Mary Clyde well knows, looks vast and boring, but
it's an unpredictable and perilous place, alive with bats,
thunderstorms, alien-looking cactuses, ornery wild pigs that can
eat a sapling straight down to the ground. Clyde's characters are
similarly deceptive. Ordinary folk, the calm center of other
people's storms, they are the staid citizens of melodramatic times,
for whom doing the right thing is a foregone conclusion, even
though they ache for behavior splashy enough to make their lives
seem worthwhile. Clyde's singular world is one where candor is
dangerous but reticence is a curse, and being called decent is
almost an insult.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Pruitt Love,'' Neil Pruitt frets because he imagines he is
too sedate for his girlfriend's frenetic and determinedly zany
family. ``They wreck cars. They turn over furniture. They throw
whatever's in their hands: books -- I've seen a biography of Samuel
Johnson knock six lit candles out of a candelabra.'' Neil comes
from a family of worriers ``orderly as the alphabet, befuddled by
clock radios and answering machines.'' In one hilariously horrific
scene, he tries to live up to his girlfriend's family's
expectations by trotting out the only bit of his history that's
remotely exotic: his mother was killed. Unfortunately, the cause
was an exploding hot-water heater. ``He saw disappointment slip
from their eyes, coming to rest at the corners of their mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the inestimable Lorrie Moore, whose work ``Survival Rates''
resembles, Clyde, winner of the Flannery O'Connor Award for Short
Fiction, has an exquisite sense of humor: sly, heart-battering and
a little tetchy. In ``Howard Johnson's House,'' Cecil, a wealthy
Phoenix plastic surgeon, gives a young girl whose ugly nose (``like
a golf club -- a 1-wood'') was bitten off by a dog a pretty new
one, and is sued by her jealous mother for the improvement.
</P>
<P>
   In the title story, Wilson, a landscape architect, feels vaguely
ashamed for contracting a lowly, inferior form of cancer instead of
something more theatrical that would better satisfy the emotional
needs of his pessimistic wife. ``Dr. Rodgers, insisting that
cancers have personalities, has told them thyroid cancer lacks any
real oncological ambition. He's called it shiftless, an
embarrassment to the whole cancer community.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the stories here are all strong, a few are splendid.
``Krista Had a Treble Clef Rose'' deserves a place in the pantheon
of harrowing stories about seriously ill children, alongside ``A
Small, Good Thing,'' by Raymond Carver, and ``People Like That Are
the Only People Here,'' by Lorrie Moore. Clyde has chosen the
tritest setting imaginable, a mall, where two seemingly average
teen-age girls -- narcissistic and misguided -- are making the
rounds of cosmetics counters and ear-piercing shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicole says, 'The anesthesia made my hair fall out. I've got
three hairs left. I'm playing up my eyes.' ``Quickly we realize
that Anne and Nicole are hardly average; they are survivors of
colon cancer, and know more than any child should about restricted
diets (no more popcorn, ever), ostomy bags -- Nicole wore clear
bags. Anne wore flesh-colored bags. She said she thought they were
more feminine'' -- and the adaptive gallows humor of the ravaged.
The power of the story is unshakable: by the end, we're desperate
for them to be run-of-the-mill, insufferable teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde's writing has many strengths, but the greatest one is her
ability to transform a shallow experience into something resembling
hope. That she does so with intelligence and wit makes this
collection as good as they get.

 &UR; DELIVER US FROM EVIL
</P>
<P>
   BY WENDY LESSER
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This is not a pleasant book to read, nor is it intended to be.
Annie Dillard writes with the fury of someone obsessed with an
idea. The idea is causing her great pain, and she wants to transmit
some of that pain to us, for if she doesn't at least make us
flinch, she will have failed in her enterprise. The obsessive idea
is both simple and, to date, unresolvable: if an all-merciful,
all-powerful God exists, how is it that evil also exists? The
question is an old one, of course, and it is not clear what makes
Dillard want to dredge it up just now. Still, there is a certain
logic in the fact that the author of ``Pilgrim at Tinker Creek''
and ``Teaching a Stone to Talk'' should choose to follow up her
earlier investigations of spirit and matter with this one.
</P>
<P>
   The subject, at any rate, unleashes Annie Dillard's most
impassioned rhetoric. ``Why did God let the Romans flay an
85-year-old Torah scholar?'' she asks, after recounting in gruesome
detail the way ``the currycombs separated the man's skin and
muscles from his bones'' in the execution of Rabbi Akiva. Nor does
she limit her examples to the deaths of martyrs. She is also
confounded by birth defects -- confounded, but also weirdly
attracted. Like a Diane Arbus in reverse, a viewer rather than a
maker of luridly clinical photographs, Dillard lingeringly
describes to us the things that can go wrong with the gene pool.
Babies with feet growing directly out of their loins, faceless or
spotted or mewing infants, ``bird-headed dwarfs'' with huge eyes
and tiny chins -- all disturb and compel her, causing her to
question her own faith. She imagines herself ``hollering at God the
compassionate, the all-merciful, WHAT'S with the bird-headed
dwarfs?''
</P>
<P>
   In her search for answers, Dillard looks to Paul Tillich and
Teilhard de Chardin, the Baal Shem Tov of the Hasidim and Rabbi
Lawrence Kushner of Sudbury, Mass. She visits China and Israel,
contemplates vast archeological digs, speaks with Palestinian bus
drivers and Dutch tourists. None of this eases her evident
distress. Toward the end of ``For the Time Being,'' she reports:
``For Tillich, God's activity is by no means interference, but
instead divine creativity -- the ongoing creation of life with all
its greatness and danger. I don't know. I don't know beans about
God.''
</P>
<P>
   But she cannot end on this note. The
philosopher-theologian-naturalist in her may be wedded to huge
unanswerabilities, but the writer, the storyteller, wants closure
and specificity. So Dillard, after listing for us the deaths of
hundreds of thousands in floods and earthquakes, millions in acts
of genocide, billions in the course of human history, ends with the
rescue of a single teen-age girl. She gives us, in suspenseful
increments, the news story of Suri Feldman, a Lubavitcher Hasid
girl lost in the Connecticut woods for several days in 1995 but
ultimately returned safely to her Brooklyn family. Dillard knows
perfectly well that this one salvation cannot compensate for the
millions of unjust, unfair or excruciatingly painful deaths. Still,
she is drawn to Suri Feldman's tale as a miracle of sorts. With a
combination of hope and misgiving, she quotes one of the searchers
in the woods: ``It says in the Bible that to save a life is to save
the entire world.''
</P>
<P>
   This concern about the relationship of the one to the many --
the individual death, for which we feel grief, set against the
incomprehensibly numerous deaths -- pervades Dillard's book. ``Who
were the families whose loess-buried hearths Genghis Khan rode over
on ponies, the people Stalin killed, the 79.2 billion of us now
dead, the 5.9 billion of us now alive, the stub-legged 3-year-old
girl exuberant in underpants and hair bows who held out her arms,
or Isaac Luria in exile? . . . How can an individual count?'' she
asks in one of several sections labeled ``Numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   But here is where we begin to see the weakness in Dillard's
effort to instill pity and terror in us. She herself is aware of
the problem, as she indicates by quoting a headline from The
Hartford Courant: ``Head-Spinning Numbers Cause Mind to Go Slack.''
Dillard follows this up with an injunction: ``But our minds must
not go slack. How can we think straight if our minds go slack?''
The damage, however, cannot be so easily repaired; wishing a thing
to be different will not make it so. The job of the writer -- even,
or especially, the philosophical or theological writer -- is to
rope in the unapprehensible, to make us feel the reality of things
that otherwise float beyond our ken. That job must be accomplished
partly, or even largely, through tone. And tone is what most often
betrays Dillard. The fatal flaw appears as early as the first
paragraph of the introductory author's note, where Dillard
characterizes her nonfiction narrative: ``Its form is unusual, its
scenes are remote, its focus wide and its tone austere. Its
pleasures are almost purely mental.'' Well, isn't that for us to
say? Dillard's failure to allow for her readers' response -- to
gauge it accurately, to trust it when necessary, to employ it
effectively as narrative glue and to tread delicately on its soft,
bruisable spots -- is the primary shortcoming of ``For the Time
Being.'' I would call it a failure of wit.
</P>
<P>
   Wit does not just mean humor, though here too there is a
problem. I most often had trouble with Annie Dillard's prose when I
thought she was trying to be darkly funny. ``It is never easy to
find good fill for construction,'' she says dryly, before starting
in on a discussion of how many people have been used, dead and
alive, for landfill. I know I am supposed to find such comments
blackly humorous, eye-openingly shocking, but instead I merely feel
imposed upon. My sense is confirmed when, two pages later, Dillard
observes: ``That mass killings and genocides recur on earth does
not mean that they are similar. Each instance of human, moral evil,
and each victim's personal death, possesses its unique history and
form.'' Banal sentimentality of this kind sits oddly with
shock-value humor, making one doubt the authenticity of the bleak,
black view. To be truly shocking, black humor must be truly felt;
otherwise, it is just a pose.
</P>
<P>
   As a Jewish atheist with little or no feel for nature, I am
admittedly not the ideal reader of ``For the Time Being.'' (The
Jewish part is important, for it means that Dillard's frequent
references to the Baal Shem Tov and Rabbi Isaac Luria lack, for me,
the appeal of exoticism.) But I think this is Annie Dillard's
problem as much as mine. A book like this should not speak just to
the converted. Unbeliever that I am, I can be made sympathetic to
the ideas and concerns expressed here -- and have been made
sympathetic to them by such recent artistic accomplishments as
Errol Morris's film ``Fast, Cheap and Out of Control'' and W. G.
Sebald's book ``The Rings of Saturn.'' Both these works use
Dillard's narrative strategy (the conjunction of seemingly
disparate facts and stories that eventually add up to a complex
whole), and both are obsessed, as she is, with the relationship
between the finite individual life and the longer, larger universe.
But for reasons mainly of tone, they succeed where she -- nobly,
courageously and with the best of intentions -- ultimately
founders.

 &UR; FIRST MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE
</P>
<P>
   BY RICHARD LINGEMAN
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   After reading Jean Strouse's voluminous biography of J. Pierpont
Morgan, with its thoroughgoing accounts of his business ventures in
the crucible stage of American capitalism, the era between the
Civil War and World War I, one is left with a multitude of rounded
impressions of this powerful but enigmatic figure. There is the
great consolidator of wastefully competing railroad lines and
industries, the ``apostle of order,''who believed, as the business
historian Edward Kirkland wrote, that ``the incalculable must give
way to the rational, strife to cooperation.'' Then there is the
consummate international financier, organizing syndicates to float
immense bond and stock issues that gave birth to companies like
A.T.&AMP; T., General Electric and United States Steel. And the
prodigious collector who spent some $60 million (approximately $900
million in today's dollars) on paintings, sculptures, rare books
and manuscripts and all manner of precious objets d'art. And the
benefactor of St. George's Episcopal Church (where he had a radical
minister installed), New York Lying-In Hospital (which he
reportedly subsidized to care for pregnant mistresses -- Strouse
scoffs at this rumor), the Metropolitan Museum of Art (to which he
did not leave his fabulous collection because the museum failed to
authorize a special wing for it in his lifetime), Harvard Law
School and the Morgan Library.
</P>
<P>
   Strouse's solidly researched biography draws, she informs us, on
an enormous archive of Morganalia that previous biographers hadn't
the temerity to crack. She debunks many of the errors propagated by
both hagiographers and muckrakers and elucidates in ample detail
Morgan's financial maneuverings (readers without an interest in
business and financial history may find some of this material
wearisome). The House of Morgan erected the financial
superstructure of the most prominent American industries in the
Gilded Age, beginning with the railroads. In the press Morgan was
garlanded with grandiose sobriquets -- the field marshal of
industry,'' the ``financial Moses of the New World,'' the
``railroad Bismarck.'' But to populists and radicals who spoke for
the struggling farmers in the West and the South, and to the
laboring men and women in factories and sweatshops, he was the
``great Financial Gorgon'' who personified the oppressive power of
Wall Street that would crucify mankind on a cross of gold.
</P>
<P>
   That image was serendipitously caught in a photograph by Edward
Steichen in which the financier, asked to change his position,
glares at the camera with intense ferocity, ``As his body
disappears in the blackness,'' Strouse writes, ``the light catches
only his head, the watch chain, and his hand on the gleaming metal
arm of his chair: this last detail looks like the blade of a
dagger, and Morgan appears about to stride out of the frame
slashing -- the ruthless capitalist pirate of popular myth.'' Not
entirely mythical in my view.
</P>
<P>
   Steichen's portrait conveys an idea of the smoldering power of
the man -- an imperious, domineering figure in richly cut clothes,
with massive body and Jovian head, baleful eyes and a chronically
diseased nose, like some purplish fleshy fungus. He was blessed
with considerable physical stamina; he lived to the age of 75, and
despite his sybaritic life style he rode his younger partners into
the ground -- and sometimes under it. He imperiously ordered bank
presidents to do what he thought was necessary to quell a financial
panic, and they usually fell in line like reluctant schoolboys.
</P>
<P>
   During the financial panic of 1907, when the nation's chronic
gold shortage triggered a run on the undercapitalized trust banks,
Morgan took charge. The challenge was to prop up the trust banks
before they toppled like a row of dominoes. To this end, he
assembled the leading bank presidents in his library and at some
point locked the door. At 4 A.M. his lawyer read them an agreement
stipulating how much each must pledge to the bailout package.
Morgan laid it on his desk and told Edward King of the Union Trust:
``There's the place, King, and here's the pen.'' King signed, as
did the others.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan transacted great schemes from Olympian heights. When he
decided to buy the Carnegie Steel company on the way to forming
United States Steel -- in 1901 the largest corporation in the world
-- he told Andrew Carnegie to name his price. Carnegie wrote down
$480 million on a single sheet of paper. Morgan glanced at the
paper and said, ``I accept this price.'' ``Pierpont Morgan is
apparently trying to swallow the sun,'' marveled Henry Adams.
</P>
<P>
   What really drove him, psychologically, Strouse can only infer
from the testimony of others. Morgan's was a secretive personality,
partly out of shyness, though he was not shy about taking credit
for saving the country on several occasions. He had the banker's
traditional reticence, part of the mystique of the priesthood.
Once, under grilling by a Congressional committee, he was asked why
he had become involved in the purchase of the Equitable Life
Assurance Society, in which the House of Morgan acquired securities
yielding only one-eighth of 1 percent. ``For the very reason that I
thought it was the thing to do,'' Morgan said, and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan was an inarticulate man with no interest in explanations
or introspection. Strouse comments: ``His authority -- in his
office, over railroads, in the world's capital markets -- came not
from what he said but from what he did.'' He took responsibility
but demanded complete authority. He insulated himself from people
who thought differently and was deaf to the agrarian protest
movements that flared up during the 1880's and 1900's.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Morgan's traits are strongly reminiscent of those the
sociologist David Riesman ascribed to the inner-directed character,
who is guided by an internal compass and a strong superego. The
chief influence on him was undoubtedly his father, Junius S.
Morgan, head of J. S. Morgan &AMP; Company in London. Morgan pre
groomed Pierpont from boyhood to take over the business. He
tirelessly drilled home the lesson that a banker's most important
business asset among his peers was ``character'' -- a reputation
for honesty and square dealing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-MORGAN-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: square dealing.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pierpont never ceased to honor his father, Strouse makes clear.
One wonders if a chronic fear of failing to live up to paternal
demands could account for the fits of depression he was subject to
throughout his life. In the throes of melancholia, he would moan
that ``the best thing would be for me to give up myself -- I don't
feel good for much anyway.'' In addition, he had been sickly as a
child, suffering mysterious ailments that gave him ``a
hypochondriacal sense of frailty all his life.'' Strouse theorizes
that the reason he never had his disfigured nose -- the result of a
skin disease called rhinophyma -- surgically modified was that he
harbored an obscure fear that if he did so he would somehow be
subject to the seizures he had experienced in childhood. The many
women in his life didn't seem put off by it, though his money
surely helped ease their qualms. He was married twice. His first
wife died young; his second wife, Fanny, bore him four children,
including the heir apparent, J. P. Morgan Jr. But Pierpont tired of
her and sought consolation elsewhere, as was the way of men of his
class. Strouse focuses on only two main mistresses, women of
sophistication and means, while admitting he was an ``indefatigable
Don Juan.'' His librarian, the spunky Belle Greene (one of the
livelier characters in a book populated by bankers; of
African-American parentage, she passed as white and presided over
his library), complained that ``every woman who comes within a mile
of J. P. immediately loses her head. . . . They flock to him all
day long in rapid and sickening succession. Each one pluming her
feathers and thinking she is the hen pheasant, when in reality she
is forgotten before her successor appears.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan was also a voracious collector of art, statues, rare
books and manuscripts. Strouse quotes the French critic Jean
Baudrillard, who wrote of the kind of collector who wishes to
``stand alone surrounded by exquisite objects like the 'sultan of a
secret seraglio.' ``Morgan's artistic and financial drives may have
been rooted in the same sexual dynamic, like Theodore Dreiser's
fictional hero Frank Cowperwood in ``The Financier.''
</P>
<P>
   If the mysteries of Morgan's inner psyche remain dark, Strouse
has clarified the public career and swept away some of the mud
slung at him by previous biographers who drew their information
from hostile contemporaries. The cool dispassion of her elegantly
modulated prose, the evenhandedness of her sources, tends to muffle
the hostile, populist roar against Morgan. Yet she does not seek to
exculpate her subject; in the end the moral she seems to draw from
his career is that ``the country's economic welfare could no longer
be left to private bankers. . . . Morgan's extraordinary authority
endangered the public welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's marriage and his personal religion, which assured him
that Christ had obligingly atoned for his sins, provided a sanction
that left him feeling ``perfectly justified in whatever he chose to
do'' in his private life, as one descendant of a Morgan intimate
tells Strouse; similarly, the prevailing social Darwinian ethos
justified his belief that whatever was good for Pierpont Morgan was
good for the country. When he intervened to damp down a financial
panic, it was always in the higher interest of economic stability
and saving the jobs of millions. But his enemies charged him with
manipulating the market for his own ends; even Teddy Roosevelt
blamed the ``malefactors of great wealth'' for the panic of 1907.
</P>
<P>
   Strouse shows that this, like many of the charges flung at
Morgan in the heat of controversy, was overstated, though it was
not entirely untrue either. Morgan's fingers were constantly in the
financial pie. She amends the record to show that Morgan's
syndicate, which handled the 1895 bond issue that brought European
gold flowing back into the Treasury's near-empty coffers, collected
nowhere near the $5 to $18 million in fees that the press reported.
But the point that should be stressed is not so much the inaccuracy
of the figure; it is that the financial rescue package Morgan
devised was totally in the service of his financial interest in
tight money policies. That is, the rescue profited the House of
Morgan and the foreign investors it serviced. During the gold
crisis, he telegraphed colleagues who had gone to Washington ahead
of him: ``We consider situation critical, politicians appear to
have absolute control.'' He meant Congress, which favored easing
the money supply and selling bonds in a public offering. To Morgan,
the representatives of the people were annoying obstacles, and the
interests of the financial class ranked far above those of the mass
of working people. When Morgan died, there was no one to replace
him; his time had passed. The United States went off the gold
standard and the Federal Reserve took control of the money supply.
But although control in Wall Street is more diffuse, the interests
of the financial class Morgan so assiduously served remain
paramount today.

 &UR; TANTANTARA!
</P>
<P>
   BY ALISON LURIE
</P>

   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   IT is not unusual for a well-known author to write a series of
novels in which the hero is a version of himself, with a few
essential characteristics altered. Philip Roth has chronicled the
lives of several alter egos. John Updike's Rabbit Angstrom has the
life Updike might have had with a much lower I.Q.; Henry Bech has
the life Updike might have had if he were Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   In England, the best-known practitioner of this genre is John
Mortimer. His many successful crime novels feature a barrister
called Horace Rumpole who, like Mortimer, is large and brilliant
and well trained in the law, but lacks Mortimer's literary
sophistication and strong will. And in the Rapstone Chronicles, of
which ``The Sound of Trumpets'' is the third and last volume, the
dominant character, Leslie Titmuss, is a kind of antiself. He has
Mortimer's shrewd intelligence and subtle understanding of English
society; but unlike Mortimer, who is a genial and relatively modest
Labor voter of upper-class origins and education, Titmuss is a
cold, dangerously ambitious Tory politician born into poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The two earlier novels in the series, ``Paradise Postponed'' and
``Titmuss Regained,'' chronicled Leslie Titmuss's rise from
obscurity to prominence in the Thatcher Government. He is now
retired and a member of the House of Lords. But back home at
Rapstone Manor, Lord Titmuss is still a powerful and even a
sinister figure. When the local M.P. is found dead in a swimming
pool, Titmuss seizes his chance to influence the coming
by-election. He despises the new Tory candidate and begins secretly
to work against him.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor candidate, Terry Flitton, the hero of this novel, is a
likable, ambitious young man, somewhat navely committed to liberal
causes. Lord Titmuss sees him as a younger version of himself: an
ambitious working-class boy who will advance ``the great cause to
which he had devoted his youth, getting up the noses of the
toffs.'' At first, Terry resists Titmuss's advice. But gradually he
starts to listen, excusing the lies he begins to tell as necessary
means to a noble end -- his election.
</P>
<P>
   Terry has a beautiful young wife named Kate, who believes in him
absolutely. She is also a New Age Puritan who believes that eating
meat is disgusting and that sex is too serious for jokes. It is not
long before Terry falls passionately in love with an older woman,
Agnes Simcox, who runs a local bookstore. When he is with her, it
is ``as though he had been given a glimpse of another country,
unexpected, extraordinary, anarchic and sometimes beautiful.''
Agnes is also an idealistic liberal, but she is far more tolerant
and knows a lot more about love than Kate.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to balance love and politics lands Terry in some wildly
comic situations. In order to please Agnes, he goes riding with
her, though he has only been on a horse once in his life. He is
given an animal called Balaclava, who has ``a mad appearance, with
a rolling eye and strong yellow teeth exposed in a sneer.'' On
their second outing, they run into a local fox hunt and Terry's
horse bolts, joining the chase. As a result, Terry, who has been
trying to avoid taking a position on the issue, earns the hatred of
animal liberationists and the support of local hunters.
</P>
<P>
   John Mortimer has always been a subtle observer of the ironies
of the British class system. ``The Sound of Trumpets'' has a
Dickensian range, and it is full of characters with Dickensian
names, from the skilled teen-age burglar, Slippy, to the
domineering -- almost dominatrix -- Home Secretary, Hannah
Mortlock, who finally determines Terry's political career. Some of
these characters have appeared in earlier volumes of the Rapstone
Chronicles, but it is not necessary to have read those novels to
enjoy this one.
</P>
<P>
   Though Mortimer is a lifelong Labor supporter, in many ways
``The Sound of Trumpets'' suggests the work of right-wing authors
like Evelyn Waugh and Kingsley Amis. Like them, Mortimer admires
practical know-how, irony and detachment. He looks with tolerance
on smoking, hunting and established religion. He loves the
countryside and hates developers and strip malls. Politically,
Mortimer seems to disapprove equally of Mrs. Thatcher and of both
her successors. He ridicules vegetarianism, atheism, astrology and
the animal rights movement. He describes the hunt saboteurs, for
instance, as ``sometimes leaving their vans to shout 'Murderers!'
at the girls from the pony club or, more daringly, to stub out
their cigarettes on the rumps of horses who had, presumably,
defected from the animal world and gone over to the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sound of Trumpets'' is a wonderful comic novel, but
underneath its humor runs a black shadow of pessimism. Politics, it
proposes, is always a dirty business. Power belongs to
Machiavellian plotters or to pushy pragmatists. Terry Flitton's
belief in liberal causes and his romantic passion are both in
conflict with his wish for power. When he is accused of being soft
on crime, and victory seems to be slipping away, he follows Lord
Titmuss's advice and attacks Agnes's best friend, a kindly gay man
who runs the local home for delinquent boys. Terry wins the
election, but loses Agnes's love.
</P>
<P>
   American readers will recognize Terry Flitton as a type common
on this side of the Atlantic as well. Indeed, his combination of
attractive rhetoric, increasingly compromised ideals and sexual
indiscretion is perhaps even more familiar here. Readers will also
recognize Lord Titmuss. Like all successful political villains, he
is fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   Titmuss manipulates everyone around him, just as an author
manipulates his characters. Like Mortimer, Titmuss has always
chosen his opponents shrewdly and defeated them successfully. Now,
though, as we learn in the last chapter, he has a more powerful
enemy: death. Titmuss faces it alone, silently and stoically,
``looking, not for the first time, towards a conclusion that even
he would find it difficult to outmaneuver.'' At this final moment,
after following his antiself through three fine novels, John
Mortimer seems to sympathize with, almost to admire, his most
remarkable creation.

 &UR; DOWN ON THE FARM
</P>
<P>
   BY LAURA MILLER
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT a rough beast is Tristan Egolf's first novel, a book that's
both interesting and exciting without quite managing to be good. It
comes accompanied by a mediagenic history: the 27-year-old American
author, something of an autodidact, collected over 50 rejection
slips from publishers here before being befriended by the daughter
of the French novelist Patrick Modiano. She found him busking on
the streets of Paris and introduced his manuscript to her father.
And, sure enough, ``Lord of the Barnyard: Killing the Fatted Calf
and Arming the Aware in the Corn Belt'' is exactly the sort of
fauvist extravaganza Europeans welcome as quintessentially
American: brash, vigorous, violent and crude.
</P>
<P>
   The novel tells the story of John Kaltenbrunner, the only son of
a much-admired East Kentucky coal mine overseer killed in a methane
gas explosion three months before John's birth. An agricultural
prodigy, young John whips the family's neglected farm into shape
almost before he's out of short pants. However, his antisocial,
single-minded devotion to poultry husbandry and sheep raising
alarms his mother, provokes his classmates and causes him to
neglect his schoolwork, drawing the ire of the high school
principal. The irritated parties join forces with a tornado and a
gang of scheming church ladies referred to as the ``Methodist
crones'' to ruin John's farm and visit upon him ``an inconceivably
bad losing streak.'' He winds up stripped of his patrimony and
sentenced to three years' work release on a river barge.
</P>
<P>
   When he gets out, John returns to Baker, the Godforsaken town
that has done him so much wrong, with vague intentions of settling
the score. After stints at the nightmarish Sodderbrook poultry
plant, a convenience store and various other scut jobs, where his
preternatural competence is equaled only by his bad attitude, John
goes to work as a garbage collector for the local landfill. There,
among the despised ``hill scrubs'' who haul the community's refuse,
he finds the ideal opportunity in a crew of downtrodden but eager
followers. He organizes a garbage strike that precipitates a
municipal crisis culminating in a devastating riot during a
basketball playoff against a rival town. Afterward, local rumor
remembers him as ``the freak on the tractor, the corncrib fascist,
the troglodytic goatroper from just north of the river -- the one
who rarely spoke a word to anyone but who, nevertheless,
unfailingly succeeded in alienating, revolting and terrifying just
about every living being he came in contact with.'' His outraged
comrades resolve to set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
   Starting out with a scenario that promises so much --
retribution, fate, history, class warfare and a malevolent sense of
place -- Egolf, unfortunately, mostly just goes around in circles.
The shortcomings of ``Lord of the Barnyard'' might well be
attributed to the inexperience (or perhaps the arrogance) of youth
and to a lack of guidance. For, refreshing as it is to read a new
novelist whose prose hasn't been manicured to lifeless perfection
by too many fiction-writing workshops, Egolf still needs someone to
tell him that he can't pull off this kind of novel without a single
line of dialogue. A good editor would also have suggested
alternatives to tortuously awkward sentences like this: ``He'd seen
one too many wetbacks hauled off in stretchers after crippling
falls from the tiers not to begin to realize that their never being
seen or heard from again indicated Sodderbrook's refusal, on
grounds of one vague technicality or another, to foot the required
medical bills.'' And a teacher might point out that even the dense,
cascading prose of Thomas Pynchon (an obvious inspiration) uses
language like a precision instrument. The author of ``Gravity's
Rainbow'' would never call a priest's phony, unctuous eulogy a
``jeremiad'' or describe a town as a ``police state'' in one
sentence and ``mob ruled'' in the next.
</P>
<P>
   There's a callowness, too, in Egolf's penchant for hyperbole.
Everything bad in Baker (which is everything in Baker) is the worst
possible specimen of its kind. The German forebears of the
townsfolk are ``the poverty-ridden, uneducated, woebegotten dregs
of the peasantry. . . . A combative, vulgar, ignorant and
hopelessly superstitious people.'' The secretaries at City Hall are
``intellectually on a par with a school of mill pond guppies.'' The
scene after a few weeks of the strike is ``heinous beyond
description.'' The words ``hideous,'' ``repulsive'' and
``abominable'' are deployed with a frequency unparalleled since the
heyday of H. P. Lovecraft. The nameless, faceless, historyless
narrator (one of the striking hill scrubs) assures us so often that
a situation or person is infinitely, inconceivably or unbelievably
awful that eventually a certain amount of disbelief does set in.
It's hard to lend credence to someone who never stops shrieking.
</P>
<P>
   Invective is a cornerstone of Egolf's characterization as well.
Pretty much everyone in ``Lord of the Barnyard'' is angry pretty
much all of the time, and nearly all of them are described as
contemptible. Of the whole scurvy lot, only John (who expresses his
nobility in his desire to be left alone) amounts to more than a
flimsy construction. Considering that the only significant female
character besides John's mother is the fiendish Hortense Allenbach
-- a middle-aged Methodist who, in the book's most ludicrous scene,
cements her triumph by taunting and sexually assaulting the
15-year-old John beside a campfire -- perhaps it's best that Egolf
doesn't try his readers' credulity further by depicting more women.
Still, for such a broad, brawling novel, ``Lord of the Barnyard''
is strangely sexless. John's seeming lack of erotic inclinations of
any kind makes him a particularly implausible teen-age boy and
suggests that Egolf can't manage to render an emotional state
softer than high dudgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Egolf's novel gave publishers plenty of reasons for
turning it down, it's also not hard to see why it won over Modiano
and finally found its way to print -- and acclaim in The Times
Literary Supplement. For all its clumsiness, ``Lord of the
Barnyard'' has the whiff of real talent -- that rare and maddening
thing -- about it. First and foremost, Egolf has a terrific story
under all that guff, one charged with dramatic conflict and built
on a scale that can encompass both individual passions and the
inchoate mind of a community. He can pile a whole atticful of
grudges and personal agendas onto it, and it still keeps chugging
along, dragging his (sometimes unwilling) reader with it. Then
there's the tremendous energy fueling Egolf's prose -- part of it
rage, yes, but also an infectious exuberance for words and the
telling of tales. Thousands of young writers produce pages of
lambent, flawless sentences without anywhere near this much life in
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord of the Barnyard'' is the book a shrewder novelist would
have stashed in a drawer, chalking it up to various lessons learned
and letting a second, more polished work serve as his debut. The
question is: Can Egolf learn to write dialogue, to fully imagine
characters and to get over his adolescent misanthropy without
refining the fire right out of his work? If he does, that second
novel will be a book to be reckoned with.

   Russia's Struggle to Free Its Economy.

</P>
<P>
   In little more than a decade, Russia has been transformed in the
minds of most Americans from menace to muddle. No realm seems
hazier than the effort by Boris N. Yeltsin and company to
metamorphose the Communist economy into a capitalist proving
ground, an exercise some liken to putting a scrambled egg back in
its shell. The 1990's present a swirl of images: bundled-up
babushkas taking to the streets to peddle their possessions as free
prices and inflation hit, buzz-cut mobsters rubbing one another out
with Capone-like gusto, the trappings of the West's good life --
from the Golden Arches to Mercedes sedans -- flooding the country.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, though we may not have grasped it, one of the most
daring social experiments in history has unfolded before our eyes.
And in ``Kapitalizm,'' Rose Brady admirably chronicles, step by
step, how Yeltsin's young reformers fought to dismantle the
insanely complex Soviet economy and construct a free-market society
in its place.
</P>
<P>
   Often it is not a pretty story, but Brady is able to see past
the blundering and corruption and appreciate the achievement that
has taken place: Eight years after the demise of the Soviet Union,
private enterprise accounts for 70 percent of Russia's economic
production, and -- most important -- the psychology of many
Russians has irretrievably changed. ``The task, then, was to
dismantle the machine,'' she writes of Anatoly Chubais, who led
Yeltsin's privatization drive. ``He had come up against fierce
opponents of reform, and in the political-economic game that ensued
he had not always played clean. But he had kept his eye on the
prize. The prize was a non-Communist Russia in which private
property dominated the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The transformation of Russia's economy is a sprawling and
byzantine tale, and Brady, a former Moscow correspondent for
Business Week, is well qualified to tell it. As could be expected,
the reform process has been a constant round of two steps forward,
one step back, with Communist die-hards in Parliament and the
so-called Red Directors of state factories resisting the march to
capitalism. Brady skillfully relates the missteps and compromises
that Yeltsin's team made along the way. Nowhere was the maneuvering
trickier than in the privatization of state-owned business and
industry, the cornerstone of the market makeover.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Chubais permitted several major banks, which had
provided the Government with much-needed loans, to acquire large
blocks of shares in industrial giants, like Norilsk Nickel, through
shady auctions. Such insider deals enabled a handful of financial
institutions to gain control over large segments of the economy at
bargain-basement prices. But Chubais, fearful that a Communist
victory in 1995 parliamentary elections might derail privatization,
wanted to make the process irreversible. Unloading factories and
oil companies to private investors, however improperly, did just
that. The year after, Brady explains, the oligarchs showed their
gratitude, plowing by some estimates $140 million into Yeltsin's
victorious re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kapitalizm'' is at its best when Brady takes readers behind
the scenes of machinations like these, or when she recounts the
rise of Russia's new magnates. Her story falls short, however, in
describing the effects of the reforms on average Russians. To be
sure, the book is replete with man-on-the-street interviews, but
closely following one or two families over the past eight years
would have been more effective.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Kapitalizm'' is one of the most coherent accounts to
date of the disassembly of the economy of the Evil Empire. Now,
with Russia mired in its worst crisis to date, all involved
acknowledge that the task has been far more daunting than they ever
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We . . . did not comprehend the enormity of the process we
were dealing with,'' Chubais says. ``We thought it was a difficult
transition that would last three years, five years, seven years.
Now it's clear that the transition will last decades.''

 &UR; VACATION GETAWAY
</P>
<P>
   BY DAVID SACKS
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   UH-oh. Americans abroad in a ``developing'' country. They mean
well, but they foist themselves on a fragile culture that is
dependent and hostile, that views them as both predator and prey.
In the fiction of writers like Graham Greene and Robert Stone, this
familiar scenario can combine crackerjack suspense with political
comment. Jill Ciment, in her fast-paced and handsomely written
second novel, ``Teeth of the Dog,'' adds a 1990's-style ingredient:
a woman's progress toward self-reliance. The result is
thought-provoking and very entertaining, if a bit unevenly plotted.
</P>
<P>
   Helene is a New York City redhead in her mid-30's with a
``negligent beauty'' and a core of sadness. For 12 years, she has
been the pampered third wife of Thomas Strauss, an eminent
anthropologist more than 30 years her senior. When their vacation
in the remote South Pacific goes tragically awry, Helene is swept
up in monstrous events. With no help available from her husband or
Uncle Sam, she faces the old challenge: adapt or die.
</P>
<P>
   The action unfolds on the fictional Melanesian island of Vanduu
-- a new and very poor country,'' one inhabitant primly explains,
``still making adjustments.'' Symbolically, Vanduu encapsulates the
ex-colonial world. A ``hodgepodge of cultures, a modern Tower of
Babel,'' it harbors a Christianized native tradition, a Muslim
minority and resident aliens from India and the entire Far East.
Tensions of race and class smolder. So do resentments over United
States foreign policy pressures and Vanduu's own ``ceaseless
dependence on tourist dollars.'' This is no place for Westerners'
fantasies of paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Ciment writes tight prose with carefully selected details, often
quirky or comical. Island life is sympathetically rendered, yet we
feel Thomas and Helene's nausea amid bad food (``Spam sushi'') and
intense heat and light.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts as a love triangle. The elderly Thomas is
battling prostate cancer, and Helene has organized this trip in the
hope that ``the sheer newness, the unrelenting beauty, the intrigue
of an unprobed culture, the mere fact of their traveling together
again, would make him, if not exactly well, at least himself.''
Instead, Vanduu's discomforts soon leave Thomas exhausted and
withdrawn, Helene bitter and defensive.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there's Finster, a raffish, expatriate Californian
with ``surfer boy good looks,'' a local salesman of sorts. Finster
(the name suggests ``window'' in Latin) is genuinely smitten with
Helene; his attention offers momentary escape and reassurance.
``She needed to be so shamelessly desired.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the plot steers close to trashy cliche: tropical
nights; a restless, sexy wife; a stranger with ``cobalt blue''
eyes. Fortunately, the author has bigger plans: Finster is too
oafish and possessive, Vanduu too ominous. The capital city ignites
in hysteria, and Helene is reduced to a lone fugitive, hunted by
the police. Desperate, she finds ways to hide out and alter her
appearance. If she can get across the island to Finster's village,
will he help her escape? The climax is exciting and fairly
plausible.
</P>
<P>
   The storytelling does show a seam or two. Both male characters
prove oddly ineffectual in adversity, given their backgrounds.
Thomas actually disappoints: sure, he's sick, but where's the
worldly, amused, manipulative mind of a renowned traveler and
writer? And Finster never quite emerges as the dangerous
entanglement we expect.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Teeth of the Dog'' delivers, on several levels. Beneath
the drama, Helene's journey toward independence suggests a metaphor
for a woman's passage toward middle age; throughout, the book
broods on the inevitability of change.
</P>
<P>
   Watching an incoming ferryboat, Finster notes the prow ``carving
a wedge of foam through the glassy swells. In Vanduuan lore, a boat
tugs a whole new ocean behind it. Ocean eats ocean. New world
devours old. The foam is the mark of its voracious appetite. Teeth
of the dog, the natives call it.''

   The hero of John Barnes' 1995 novel ``Kaleidoscope Century'' was
a coldhearted hit man with one redeeming quality: he was marginally
less nasty than a sadistic comrade in arms who took pleasure in
``serbing'' his female victims before dispatching them. Since
Barnes has an undeniable knack for getting under the skin of his
characters, it was perhaps inevitable that some readers had trouble
distinguishing the author from his disturbing creations. My
grudgingly positive review of ``Kaleidoscope Century'' ended with
the hope that there would be no sequels. I am happy to report that
FINITY (Tor/Tom Doherty, $22.95) is an altogether different kind of
book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finity'' starts from a premise as edgy as anything conjured by
Philip K. Dick. Quantum theory -- the set of assumptions and
equations that allows us to get a grip, however slippery, on the
behavior of the smallest of things -- poses severe challenges to
the conventional view of reality. To explain the odd behavior of
subatomic particles, which are literally neither here nor there
until you look for them, some physicists posit the existence of an
ever-expanding number of realities in which everything that is
possible actually happens somewhere. For example, if you observe a
particular particle jump to the left, there is another reality in
which that particle jumps to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its value to modern physics, the so-called Many Worlds
hypothesis has proved useful to science fiction writers, because it
affords scientifically respectable cover to the wildest
speculations about alternative histories: what kind of world would
result if, say, Nazi Germany won World War II or Lyndon Johnson
became president of a latter-day Republic of Texas? But Barnes goes
far beyond such conjectures to question the nature of reality
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle Peripart, an American expatriate who teaches astronomy in
21st-century New Zealand, takes for granted that his world was
shaped by the triumph of Hitler's nuclear-armed forces over Allied
resistance in the 1940s. Then he learns from a Delphic billionaire
named Geoffrey Iphwin that widespread use of quantum-based computer
chips is breaking down the barriers between the Many Worlds, so
that calling on a cell phone or taking a ride in an automated taxi
can catapult you into a reality with a radically different past.
</P>
<P>
   Peripart joins a group of adventurers out to discover why, in
all the worlds they visit, there is no sign of life from the North
American territory of the former United States. The cast of
characters, who change in subtle and not so subtle ways as their
pasts mutate, are engaging enough to hold our attention; along with
the pathos and puzzlement inherent in their situation, they manage
to find humor and several varieties of love before the narrative
reaches as much of a conclusion as is possible in the endlessly
malleable universe they inhabit.
</P>
<P>
   John Barnes' recent collection of short stories, APOSTROPHES AND
APOCALYPSES (Tor/Tom Doherty, $24.95), offers additional reason to
welcome this writer to the front ranks of contemporary science
fiction. At least four of the stories have never been published
before, including the best of the lot, ``Gentleman Pervert, Off on
a Spree,'' which bares the thoughts and feelings of a sex addict at
a time when virtual reality has made possible the easy
gratification of all itches except one.
</P>
<P>
   Because he writes so well about unrepentantly macho men, Barnes
has been identified with what might be called science fiction's
right wing -- a school of writing exemplified by Robert A.
Heinlein, in which fierce independence and military discipline are
passionately (if paradoxically) held up as saving virtues for
future societies. But Barnes seems less eager to sell a point of
view than to explore it: his gentleman pervert is agonizingly
honest about his fear of impotence and the other self-doubts that
drive him to sexual excess.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered among the stories, which play agreeable and
stimulating variations on many of the genre's longest-standing
themes, are little essays that give Barnes the opportunity to vent
his strongly held opinions on almost everything. A self-proclaimed
atheist who constructs imaginary futures with the aid of computer
spreadsheets believes that science fiction, having lost its onetime
central metaphor of space travel to the bean counters at NASA, is
now in danger of losing its franchise as an ``escape hatch'' for
teen-agers. While some might applaud this as a sign of progress,
Barnes argues that a genre can do a lot worse than function as a
dream machine for adolescents; he likens their efforts to figure
out the adult world to the work that readers must do to comprehend
any fiction set in a possible future.
</P>
<P>
   One of the revelations of ``Apostrophes and Apocalypses'' is how
Barnes's freewheeling imagination thrives at shorter lengths; his
novels tend toward repetition of narrative elements rather than
development of theme or character. Vernor Vinge, who wrote the Hugo
Award-winning novel ``A Fire Upon the Deep'' (1992), returns to the
same far-future universe in A DEEPNESS IN THE SKY (Tor/Tom Doherty,
$27.95). Despite its many virtues, a comparison of his new novel
with ``A Fire Upon the Deep'' demonstrates the critical importance
of scale in science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Fire Upon the Deep'' ranged the Milky Way, encompassing a
galaxy of diverse humans and nonhumans and dealing with literally
cosmic issues. It never seemed padded; indeed, I finished it hungry
for more. ``A Deepness in the Sky'' is set 30,000 years earlier.
Although humanity has already spread through the galaxy, the story
concentrates on events in a single star-system. Representatives of
the Qeng Ho, a galactic trading consortium, and the Emergents, a
group of long-isolated humans with strange powers, vie for control
of one another and for the opportunity to exploit a planet of
intelligent nonhumans, called Spiders, who are just reaching their
technological maturity.
</P>
<P>
   The novel's 606 pages offer ample scope for Vinge to elaborate
on his themes -- the allure of power, the power of knowledge, the
necessity of freedom. The point of view shifts back and forth among
the Traders, the Emergents and the nonhumans. While the latter
physically resemble spiders, their social organization is
reminiscent of 19th-century England; unlike the truly alien
nonhumans in ``A Fire Upon the Deep,'' the Spiders interact with
one another and with the encroaching humans in mostly predictable
ways.
</P>
<P>
   While disappointing, this is hardly a fatal flaw; the three-way
struggle for dominance provides sustained suspense as well as
carefully calibrated fireworks at well-timed intervals. But the
book is simply too long for its subject. Instead of feeding our
curiosity about the boundless expanse of space-time, as he did in
``A Fire Upon the Deep,'' Vinge weighs down this much more compact
tale with gratuitous detail and dispensable background information.
A more economical telling would have focused attention where it
belongs, on the shrewdly interlocking plot lines with their
surprising yet satisfying resolution.

 THE RISE AND FALL OF CLASS IN BRITAIN

 &UR; POWER RANKINGS
</P>
<P>
   BY PAUL S. SEAVER
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In 1940 George Orwell accepted as a fact that England was ``the
most class-ridden country under the sun.'' Although in more recent
times Margaret Thatcher complained that class was ``a Communist
concept,'' John Major, in his expressed intention to create a
classless society, testified to its ubiquity. A minor pleasure
experienced by North American visitors is that our accent
immediately betrays us as foreigners, thus not subject to the
complex rules and resentments that still seem to govern class
relations in England. For the English truly seem obsessed with
class to a degree that startles a visitor.
</P>
<P>
   Although David Cannadine is a native of Britain, it may be his
experience as a professor of modern British history in America
(``The Rise and Fall of Class in Britain'' originated as the
Leonard Hastings Schoff Memorial Lectures at Columbia University)
that suggested the subject of his new book: certainly class has a
different history here than in Britain. In any event, this richly
documented study is concerned not so much with class today as with
the emergence of class as a social category, as the dominant way of
viewing social distinctions in England during the past three
centuries (the rest of Britain is not entirely neglected, and
Cannadine is sensitive to the role played by the North American
colonies and later by the British in India).
</P>
<P>
   As Cannadine notes, class analysis has gone out of fashion as
the motor of history since the 1970's, not only because of the
decline of Marxism but also because of the rise of feminist and
post-modernist critiques. His intention is not to buck this trend
by resurrecting class as a historical force, but rather to trace
the complex history of its use as an analytical category and to
steer a middle course between ``the overdetermined reductionism of
Marxist analysis and the free-floating subjectivities of the
historians of language.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally the English have been understood to view their
society as an aspect of the Great Chain of Being, as a graded
hierarchy of ranks, degrees and orders from the peasant laborer at
the bottom to the duke and prince at the top, a view inherited from
the Middle Ages but still current in the 16th and 17th centuries.
While this was the dominant view of society, some observers talked
at times in terms of ``better sorts'' and ``meaner sorts'' of
people, dichotomous terms particularly in vogue in times of acute
social tension. By the 17th century, in the light of the
spectacular growth of London, many described urban artisans and
merchants as ``middling sorts,'' lying roughly between the landed
classes and the rural peasantry.
</P>
<P>
   The Industrial Revolution was seen as transforming this
traditional society into the class-dominated society of modern
times, a development leading to the rise of modern parties and in
turn to the identification of party with class, to the decline of
the Liberal Party and the rise of Labor, the party of the working
class, arrayed against the Tories, the party of business, privilege
and property that has dominated British politics since 1945. What
Cannadine demonstrates with an array of apt quotations is that at
least from the late 17th century to the present, social analysts of
various stripes described English society in hierarchical, triadic
or dichotomous terms, depending in part on ideological need.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Johnson, a Tory, preferred to visualize English society as a
graded hierarchy in which every subject had a God-given place, and
in which deference to those above and the right to command those
below naturally followed from one's location in the hierarchy. Such
a vision does not vanish with the Industrial Revolution but
reappears both early in the 19th century in Robert Southey, who
invokes ``That appointed chain, /
</P>
<P>
   Which when in cohesion it unites /
</P>
<P>
   Order to order, rank to rank, /
</P>
<P>
   In mutual benefit,'' and in a different register in
late-19th-century social Darwinists, who, if they did not
necessarily see a hierarchical order as God-given, nevertheless saw
inequality as built into the natural order.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, revolutionaries like Tom Paine saw society in
dichotomous terms, us against them. Paine wrote, ``There are two
classes of men in the nation, those who pay taxes and those who
receive and live upon taxes.'' A triadic vision, one in which a
middle class was thought to play a particularly enticing role, is
found in Lord John Russell's argument for the 1832 Reform Bill; he
felt that enfranchising part of the middle classes would enable
them to ``bind firmly and kindly the different classes of society
together.''
</P>
<P>
   ON the whole, the evidence convinces Cannadine that society is
too complex for any form of class analysis to have more than a
rhetorical resonance. Nonetheless, he points out that while Labor
claimed to speak for the working class, Labor between the wars
never received as much as 50 percent of the working-class vote -- a
statement that makes sense only if indeed there was a working
class. Later he notes that ``although the Tories delighted in
working-class embourgeoisement, and although Labor feared it, this
turned out to be no more than another ideological stereotype: there
was very little evidence that prosperous members of the working
class crossed a great social (and political) divide and became
middle-class Tories'' -- a statement that implies both a working
class and a middle class, separated by a virtually unbridgeable
gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Even if class categories are at best social approximations,
Cannadine, like the rest of us, cannot do without them: in certain
contexts modern societies seem not to behave simply as congeries of
atomistic individuals, no matter how much they escape our simple
categories in other circumstances. At the end of this important and
provocative study Cannadine asks whether a classless England is
conceivable, at least in the sense that he sees the United States
as classless -- a society in which vast income disparities and
inequalities ``do not translate into corresponding inequalities of
social prestige or social perceptions'' (a characterization of our
society that may not be beyond dispute). Nevertheless, he does
point out reasonably enough that if such a society is what Tony
Blair aims to create, the minimum requirements are the elimination
of titles and honors along with an educational system that
reinforces class perceptions. ``But,'' he asks rather sadly at the
end, ``is such a 'classless society' something the British actually
want?''

 DIARIES 1898-1902 BY ALMA MAHLER-WERFEL.

 &UR; SERIAL MUSE
</P>
<P>
   BY JOHN SIMON
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Viennese enchantress Alma Schindler (1879-1964) was one of
our era's most fascinating and fabled women. Beautiful, smart,
talented, ambitious and sexy, she was successively the companion of
four celebrated artists: the composer Gustav Mahler, the painter
Oskar Kokoschka, the architect Walter Gropius and the writer Franz
Werfel, and she married all but Kokoschka. She had intense
flirtations with the painter Gustav Klimt and the composer
Alexander Zemlinsky; the composers Hans Pfitzner and Gustave
Charpentier, the piano virtuoso Osip Gabrilovich and the playwright
Gerhart Hauptmann were variously smitten with her.
</P>
<P>
   Alma had other admirers and wooers, but, more important, she was
also an artist in her own right. Until Mahler, not one to brook
competition, forbade her to compose, she had written some exquisite
lieder, which today's concert artists are happily rediscovering.
After that spousal interdict she switched to being a muse and
impresario, with impressive success. Even her daughters were
memorable. Anna became a noteworthy sculptor, and the angelic
Manon, who died at 18, inspired Alban Berg's Violin Concerto,
possibly the greatest musical elegy of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad that neither Klimt nor Kokoschka left us a full-scale
incisive portrait of her. Neither Kokoschka's double portrait of
himself and Alma nor his mythicized impression of their lovemaking,
``The Squall,'' quite does the job, leaving us dependent on
photographs. In the early ones, we see an imposing, full-breasted
young woman with opulent hair and fine, firm features. More
handsome perhaps than strictly beautiful, she compels with the
alertness and determination of her gaze. To invoke her adored
Wagner, she is part Sieglinde, part Brnnhilde.
</P>
<P>
   For her deeper aspects, there is her 1957 autobiography, ``Mein
Leben'' (``My Life''), untrustworthy though it often is. Any number
of ghostwriters grappled with Alma's powerful urge to embellish,
exaggerate or suppress. The youthful ``Diaries'' being published
now, even if they cover only the period from 1898 to 1902, are an
important addition. Although they did not escape the revisions and
excisions of an Alma who kept fiddling with them, they strongly
illuminate her formative years -- amazing that they lay so long
unpublished in the library of the University of Pennsylvania. They
fill Alma's exercise books numbered 4-25. The whereabouts of the
first three are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Matters were not simplified for the editors, Antony Beaumont and
Susanne Rode-Breymann, by Alma's difficult handwriting and bizarre
punctuation, but at least, despite considerable later striking out,
only a few words were entirely obliterated. Valuable, too, are the
attached letters, playbills, concert programs and snapshots, though
these are generally not reproduced in this English-language
edition, which is actually abridged selections from the German one,
made and translated by Beaumont. But we do get some of Alma's
charming drawings, attesting to yet another side of this complex
personality.
</P>
<P>
   Alma was the daughter of Jakob Schindler, a decent
middle-of-the-road Viennese painter, and his German wife, whose
checkered career included being an actress, dancer, singer and
nanny. When Schindler died prematurely, Carl Moll, a lesser painter
who had insinuated himself into the household as a disciple,
married the widow. The adolescent Alma, who had loved her father,
disliked her mother and was unfond of her stepfather. How her
younger half sister, the very average Gretl, felt, is unrecorded.
</P>
<P>
   Moll was a member of the Secession, the important avant-garde
art movement, in whose exhibition building he had an office. Alma
paid almost daily visits to the rotating art exhibits. With that
family background, it was natural for her to develop an early
interest in painting and music, and she also became an avid though
unsystematic reader. What she, like other girls of the Austrian
bourgeoisie, lacked was a formal education, much regretted by her:
``Why are boys taught to use their brains, but not girls? . . . My
mind has not been schooled, which is why I have such frightful
difficulty with everything.'' She, however, like other girls of her
standing, did play the piano, studying with the respectable blind
pianist-composer Josef Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Part of studying with him was composing various pieces, to which
Alma took with aptitude and enjoyment. The confessions she made to
her diary show an eager, lively, impatient mind, interested and
judgmental in observing the people she met at lunches and dinner
parties she regularly attended with her family, at home or about
town, often playing the piano for the guests.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Diaries'' divide neatly, though not explicitly, into three
parts. In the first year, Alma, still teen-age and innocent, falls
in love for the first time with her fairy prince, the 36-year-old
premier Secessionist painter Gustav Klimt, at that time still
building up his reputation. A handsome fellow, Klimt was by no
means unresponsive to Alma, but then he enjoyed numerous
involvements with women, especially with his brother's pretty widow
and her even prettier younger sister. He had no intention of
getting married and, in his relatively short life, he never did.
</P>
<P>
   Alma, however, was anything but das ssse Wiener M &QL; diamond &QC; del,
the sweet young working-class girl with whom young gentlemen had
their affairs before unhurriedly settling down to serious work and
respectable marriages. So she already dreamed of becoming Klimt's
beloved wife while still misspelling his name as Klimpt. She
steadily frequented the theater, opera and concerts with her family
and soon became an ardent Wagnerite. Intoxicated especially with
``Siegfried'' and ``Tristan,'' she might have deduced from their
texts that marital bliss was not generally in a young woman's
cards. Instead, transported by the music, she fantasized union with
Klimt, even though he never held out false promises.
</P>
<P>
   The idyll did not extend beyond two passionate kisses on a trip
to Italy, where the painter briefly joined the Moll family. But
they were enough to haunt Alma through much of the next two years,
when she fell under the consecutive and overlapping spell of the
outstanding Secessionist architect Josef Olbrich; the artistic
director of the Burgtheater and comic playwright Max Burckhard;
and, above all, Alexander Zemlinsky, to whom she turned for more
advanced music lessons.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-MAHLER-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: music lessons.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This phase of the ``Diaries'' is especially absorbing for Alma's
ability to talk herself into and out of love with any one of them
(not to mention some lesser others), even as she deplored Olbrich's
dandyism and dentures, Burckhard's somewhat brash Casanovaishness
and Zemlinsky's dwarfish stature, receding chin and Jewishness (be
it noted that Alma's conventional anti-Semitism did not stop her
from marrying two Jews). With Zemlinsky she went farthest,
alternately playing down and bemoaning his ugliness in wonderfully
tormented but always catchy prose. Farther off, and slowly
ascending in Alma's firmament, was the admired and resented
conductor of the Vienna Philharmonic and Opera, Gustav Mahler, whom
she longed to meet, though she was not impressed by his
compositions.
</P>
<P>
   Alma was the Lady of Ambivalence, the lover full of reversals,
and she was, despite her free spirit, puritanical enough to remain
a heavily petting virgin until her marriage or thereabouts. She
was, apparently, a stimulating conversationalist, with independent,
often highly perceptive views on painters, composers and writers.
Her observations about Mozart, Berlioz, Richard Strauss (``a
brilliant pig''), Mascagni and Mahler are arresting. Thus, of
Mahler's ``Klagende Lied'' she writes: ``The text is excellent, the
melody a little impoverished, but the structure firm and effective.
I can imagine some passages sounding quite passable.''
</P>
<P>
   Her rejection of the highly popular Karl Goldmark and Ambroise
Thomas is as interesting as her ambivalence about Arnold
Schoenberg. Among writers, she adores Goethe and Dante (despite his
religious views), enjoys some Byron and Zola, but has no use for
``Madame Bovary.'' When most distressed with her men, she goes to
bed with a volume of Nietzsche or Darwin, and feels restored.
</P>
<P>
   Her chief biographer, Berndt Wessling, begins with this
quotation: ``No one will ever succeed in completely describing me;
not even I myself succeeded. I am full of enigmas that can't be
solved. In distant days they'll say of me: She was a sphinx.''
</P>
<P>
   I would single out this from the ``Diaries,'' where Alma,
already deeply involved with Mahler, attends a ``Meistersinger''
under his baton and ``outrageously'' flirts with a physician,
Ludwig Adler, seated nearby, when she realizes, ``to my horror,''
that a rich suitor of hers, Felix Muhr, ``was sitting next to him
and had probably been observing the entire maneuver. I felt ashamed
of myself, absolutely ashamed. All the same, I noticed that M. was
looking the other way, so I quickly turned my head in his
direction, and we exchanged a voluptuous glance -- for a long,
wonderful moment -- regardless of onlookers. Such a glance can be
stunningly sensual -- and he's the very picture of a man. . . .
There's good stock for you. Mahler can't compete with that. But
otherwise I remain independent and, at heart, faithful to Gustav.''
</P>
<P>
   This faithfulness was hard-earned. The third division into which
the ``Diaries'' naturally fall -- the last five or six of the
exercise books -- is the most titillating, as it concerns a young
woman previously shocked by seeing dogs copulate but now absorbed
in watching two flies do the same. Here she fluctuates between the
passionate embraces of Zemlinsky, about whom she feels mostly
lustful, and Mahler, toward whose delicate frame and health she has
strongly protective, maternal feelings. With both she gets into
intimate sexual situations, described in somewhat prudish terms,
but explicitly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is Zemlinsky, ``this ugly, sweet little man'' of whom we
read: ``I sucked on his mouth. Suddenly I felt him salivate --
again and again -- &AMP; I drank eagerly from his mouth -- blessed
impregnation!'' Now it is Mahler: ``So much irritates me: his
smell, the way he sings, the way he speaks (can't roll his
rrrr's).'' We learn about ``his breath so sweet'' and that he ``let
me feel his masculinity -- his vigor -- &AMP; it was a pure, holy
sensation.'' (But he did bite the nails of his beautiful hands.)
</P>
<P>
   Another time: ``I let him touch me with his hand. Stiff and
upright stood his vigor. He carried me to the sofa, laid me gently
down and swung himself over me. Then -- just as I felt him
penetrate, he lost all strength. He laid his head on my breast,
shattered -- and almost wept for shame. Distraught as I was, I
comforted him. . . . Then I broke down, had to weep, weep on his
breast.'' Still, it was Burckhard whom Alma, amid all this, first
let kiss her ``wildly &AMP; with his tongue.'' But then, she kept
reversing herself practically to the altar. Even after their
engagement, when Mahler one day ``begged me to talk . . . I
couldn't find one word of warmth. Not one.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Alma sees herself as a creature with two souls, and
though she chooses Mahler feels the need to defend herself against
charges of calculation by adducing his being sickly, professionally
insecure, not so young, Jewish and deep in debt. And she concludes
the diary with a near-contradiction: ``I must rise to meet him,''
but also ``I must . . . let everything happen to me of its own
accord.'' Readers who want to investigate how that marriage worked
out should consult Jonathan Carr's ``Mahler.'' The ``Diaries,''
despite Antony Beaumont's often ungrammatical translation, offer an
incisive portrait of a young femme fatale and a vivid eyewitness
account of endearing and enervating turn-of-the-century Vienna.

   In the opening pages of Aleksandar Tisma's ``Book of Blam,'' the
eponymous protagonist, Miroslav Blam, sets out for a stroll through
the city of Novi Sad in Tito's Yugoslavia. He finds himself drawn
to what was once the street of the Jews, before the war, now ``the
destination of many idle strollers like Blam.'' He is not, however,
just any idle stroller, for Blam is one of the few Jewish survivors
in Novi Sad, and he can remember the street when it was inhabited
by the now annihilated Jewish population of the city. Following in
Blam's footsteps, in a stunning literary excursion, Tisma conjures
the names and fates of the former inhabitants. He recounts what
occurred at each address after Hitler defeated Yugoslavia in 1941
and Hungary, Germany's ally, occupied the city of Novi Sad:
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 13 housed Arthur Spitzer's grocery and delicatessen.
Spitzer played amateur soccer and had non-Jewish friends. Having
married a Hungarian and converted before the war, he was spared
persecution. He had no children of his own, but his sister sent him
her 6-year-old daughter from the Independent State of Croatia,
where Jews had an even harder time of it. . . . For a while his
baptismal certificate, Christian wife and soccer friends protected
him. On the day his young Jewish niece was to be deported, Spitzer
and his wife went to the station with her, hoping to save her with
their papers and connections. They were all crammed into a train
for Auschwitz.''
</P>
<P>
   Tisma builds his novel around the fictional figure of Blam, who
does escape deportation, in part because he, like Arthur Spitzer,
has a non-Jewish wife. Blam becomes the focus for the literary
reconstruction of a demolished urban landscape and society,
represented according to the intricate historical circumstances of
Eastern Europe during World War II. First published in Yugoslavia
in 1972, now powerfully translated by Michael Henry Heim from the
language that used to be called Serbo-Croatian, ``The Book of
Blam'' offers a literary memorial to the former Jews of the former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Novi Sad is a name perhaps best known to the American public as
the hometown of the tennis superstar Monica Seles -- cited in
sports stories as a place where the scarcity of acceptable tennis
courts for training inevitably compelled Seles to migrate to
America at 12. Novi Sad played a considerably more complicated part
in European history, its urban development dating to the 18th
century, when the city grew up alongside the Danube, facing the
great Hapsburg fortress of Petrovaradin. In the 19th century Novi
Sad became a center of Serbian literary culture, though the city
had a heterogeneous population of Serbs, Hungarians, Germans and
Jews. It was the principal city of the Vojvodina province, itself a
geographical crossroads of even greater ethnographic diversity,
including large communities of Croatians and Romanians. Thus Novi
Sad reflected the multinational character of the Hapsburg monarchy,
before being assigned to Yugoslavia in the peace settlement
following World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Tisma traces a fictional family history of migrating Hapsburg
Jews through the whole 19th century and across the map of Eastern
Europe, showing how the parents of Miroslav Blam happened to settle
in Novi Sad. The most remarkable of Tisma's literary historical
accounts, however, is that of the massacre of 1942 in Novi Sad,
perpetrated by the Hungarian military. The Hungarian population of
Novi Sad lived under Yugoslav sovereignty after World War I; the
Serbian population was handed over by Hitler to Hungarian rule
during World War II. Tisma begins with an urban map: ``Look at the
map of Novi Sad, and you will see a kind of spider's web
intersecting on one side with a broad ribbon in the form of a half
circle but extending evenly in all other directions. The ribbon,
usually colored blue, is the Danube.'' He then imagines the
Hungarian officers plotting their murderous raid from that same map
-- they divided the spiderweb of the city's streets into several
hundred smaller webs, assigning patrols to each'' -- and follows
the patrols as they check documents and order executions. Thousands
of Jews and Serbs were killed in the massacre, and Tisma attempts
to convey the atrocity of the historical moment by describing what
happened in a sampling of houses and neighborhoods. One of the
patrols comes to the house of Blam's parents, who are promptly
taken outside and shot.
</P>
<P>
   Other works by Tisma also explore the experience of World War II
in Novi Sad, including ``The Use of Man,'' which has been
translated into English. Some of the same regional terrain also
appears in the fiction of Danilo Kis, who, like Tisma, came from
Vojvodina and wrote about the situation of Yugoslav Jews during the
war. Tisma himself was associated with Tito's Partisans during the
war and afterward played a prominent role in Yugoslav literary life
during the decades of Communism. ``The Book of Blam'' has a young
Communist heroine -- Blam's sister Estera, who is killed in the
Resistance as she throws her last grenade. Hers is one of the
ghosts that haunts Blam after the war. Another is that of the
novel's political villain, Predrag Popadic, a handsome young rake
who collaborates with the Hungarian occupation by editing a Serbian
newspaper in Novi Sad. He seduces Blam's mother and, later, Blam's
wife as well (though not, of course, Estera) but attempts to use
his influence to protect the Blam family under the Hungarian
occupation. After the liberation of Novi Sad the victorious
Communist Partisans arrest Popadic and summarily execute him beside
the Danube, blowing his brains out with a dumdum bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Tito's Yugoslavia was politically constructed as the federal
union of six separate republics: Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia,
Macedonia and Montenegro. The republic of Serbia included two
autonomous provinces: one was Kosovo, with its large Albanian
majority, and the other was Vojvodina, with its large Hungarian
minority. Novi Sad was the provincial capital of the multinational
Vojvodina, and the name of the city was also associated with the
affirmation of cultural unity in Yugoslavia, for it was the Novi
Sad linguistic agreement of 1954 that declared Serbo-Croatian to be
a single language, spoken in two dialects and written in two
scripts. Tisma wrote his novel in Serbo-Croatian, but today both
Serbs and Croats insist on the distinction between Serbian and
Croatian.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian nationalists demonstrated in Novi Sad in 1988, toppling
the provincial government and paving the way for Slobodan Milosevic
to abolish autonomy in both Vojvodina and Kosovo. The overturning
of the intricate Titoist constitution, with its calculated
structure of checks and balances among the nationalities, has
severely reduced the cultural protections and prerogatives of the
Hungarians, as well as the several other minorities, in Vojvodina.
Tisma, living in France, has bitterly condemned the brutal warfare
that continues to accompany the disintegration of Yugoslavia, and
``The Book of Blam,'' looking back to Novi Sad in World War II,
explores the political pressures by which a multinational urban
community became the site of murderous internecine enmity. Indeed,
the various remembered and misremembered versions of what happened
during World War II in Yugoslavia have certainly contributed to the
violence of national conflict in the 1990's.
</P>
<P>
   Tisma describes the assembling of the Jews of Novi Sad in the
city's synagogue in 1944, as they awaited deportation to the
concentration camps: ``The Jews sat patiently within the confines
of the synagogue; the guards did their duty meticulously, showing
anger only in the street, when they had to disperse curious
onlookers -- one group of which included a dejected-looking Blam,
exempt because of his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only discordant note in this otherwise harmonious waiting
period came from the animal world rather than the human world; it
came in the form of the dogs that had trotted alongside their
masters to the synagogue and that remained outside when the guards
refused to let them through the gates.''
</P>
<P>
   Tisma thus follows the deportation from the perspective of the
confused dogs, who cannot figure out the unfathomable human logic
of the Holocaust. The novel returns to the synagogue for the final
chapter, in which Blam attends a concert of the Novi Sad Chamber
Orchestra, performed in the former temple, now best appreciated for
its excellent acoustics. In the synagogue, with its handsomely
surviving cupolas, pillars, chandeliers and mosaics, Blam's inner
acoustical sensitivity focuses his memory with excruciating clarity
on his family and their community, which did not survive the
terrible course of the 20th century.

 &UR; NO, NOT THAT GOVERNOR OF MINNESOTA
</P>
<P>
   BY PETER APPLEBOME
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   They are all there at the Professional Wrestling Online Museum.
Stanislaus Zbyszco, the Viennese intellectual and pioneer grappler
from the first decade of the 20th century, is there facing off with
the Great Gama of India. So are Nature Boy Ric Flair and Superstar
Billy Graham. There are the legendary international tag-teams --
the Fabulous Kangaroos, the ferocious Wild Samoans, the Kalmikoffs
(evil Russians from the 1960's) and Krusher Kruschev and Ivan
Koloff, a more pumped-up, contemporary variation on the theme.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, the only governor in the
nation who used to make a living running around in glitter tights
and a feathered boa, didn't make the cut. So maybe it was to
redress a wrong that the humorist Garrison Keillor decided to give
us this odd little hiccup of political satire telling Ventura's
story, more or less, in the fictional form of Jimmy (Big Boy)
Valente's rise from the ring to the Minnesota Governor's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to think of a fatter target for satire than
Ventura, which is exactly the problem with this mildly amusing,
mildly irritating quickie book. It is hard enough to parody
professional wrestling, which is a parody in itself. It is harder
still to take a subject treated with amusement by political writers
from International Falls to Washington and make it fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me'' has the feel of promising material for ``A Prairie Home
Companion,'' where Keillor has been doing Ventura takeoffs for
months. Indeed, it reads best if you can summon up Keillor's droll,
deadpan voice while reading it. But as a book, it feels more like a
smart marketing concept than inspired satire.
</P>
<P>
   You don't even make it to Page 1 before you get the idea that
perhaps this book was knocked out a bit too hastily. Across from
the title page is a funny made-up listing of Keillor's other books,
like ``Lentils and You,'' ``10 Steps to More Sensitive Writing''
and ``Dear Heart: The Correspondence of Eudora Welty and Weeb
Eubanks.'' It is a nice joke, but the former Jets coach was Weeb
Eubank, not Eubanks. Even a slender book like ``Me'' probably takes
more than two months to get right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me'' takes the form of a memoir as told to Keillor by a
cantankerous Valente. Augmented by stylized drawings and written in
muscular, weasels-ripped-my-flesh prose, it takes its hero from his
birth in Minneapolis to Vietnam to a fabulous wrestling career and
to his election as Minnesota's Governor.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of quirky touches Keillor's fans will
appreciate, like the father who died while duck hunting when his
waders filled with water. And Keillor certainly captures the
over-the-top nuttiness of wrestling in the form of characters like
Vicious Eddie the Mohawk Kid, who has a zipper implanted in his
cheek that he unzips so people can see the food in his mouth; the
Widowmaker, who runs around in a black hangman's mask whacking guys
with two-by-fours and lead pipes; and a yuppie bad boy named Brent
Beige, who wears white Calvin Klein briefs, brings his cell phone
into the ring and whines about his hair while the crowd begs his
opponent to destroy him.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Valente's own wrestling persona as the first
modern existential wrestler, a mixture of the best qualities of
James Arness, Larry of the Three Stooges, Spiro Agnew, the Grand
Exalted Potentate of the Zuhrah Shrine and Bo Diddley.
</P>
<P>
   It has its moments, but even this little goes a long way, absent
a more ambitious satiric premise than Keillor came up with. And
don't even ask about the dubious gag in which Valente is pursued by
a Vietnamese nemesis who turns up repeatedly hollering things like,
``One day I wirr clush you rike a pop can, Big Boy!''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the book is a sendup of the celebrity culture in
which every bozo of the moment uses his 15 minutes of fame to tell
his story. But it may say as much about the current culture of
celebrity writers and the endless appetite of the big bookstore
chains for new product by brand-name authors.
</P>
<P>
   And, as with much of Keillor's work, it's hard to be sure
whether the book reflects a keen instinct for life in Lake Wobegon
country or a snotty condescension toward it. Ventura may turn out
to be a total geek, but the last American politician so easy to
ridicule was probably the one who starred in ``Bedtime for Bonzo.''
He did fine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is one thing that is haunting about the Ventura
saga. Take a look at Ventura's shaved head, rippling muscles and
modest mustache. Go to the on-line wrestling museum and check out
the almost identical pictures of Stanislaus Zbyszco, described as a
noted intellectual who studied music, philosophy and law in his
native Austria. Could Jesse Ventura, existential wrestling
politician, and Stanislaus Zbyszco, existential wrestling pioneer
-- dead since 1967! -- be the same person? As the post-Monica world
waits for the next story of the century, you might stay tuned.

 &UR; THE ALLURE OF THE EVERYDAY
</P>
<P>
   BY ALICE TRUAX
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the first of the three slim novels in this
collection, an Indian boy named Sandeep sets out with his uncle for
an evening walk through the back lanes of Calcutta during a power
failure. Sandeep is only 10, but he already thinks of himself as a
writer, and he finds his curiosity stirred by each house he passes:
the one with a dozing watchman, ``which gave the impression that
the family had valuables locked away inside''; the one with the old
man on its veranda; ``or this small, shabby house with the girl
Sandeep glimpsed through a window, sitting in a bare, ill-furnished
room, memorizing a text by candlelight, repeating suffixes and
prefixes from a Bengali grammar over and over to herself -- why did
these houses seem to suggest that an infinitely interesting story
might be woven around them?''
</P>
<P>
   Amit Chaudhuri is an immensely gifted writer who is less
interested in one particular story than in all the bits and pieces
of stories that make up ordinary life: ``The 'real' story, with its
beginning, middle, and conclusion,'' will never be told, he warns
us cheerfully, because it does not exist. This conviction may be
both his blessing and his curse. His novels -- or novellas, really
-- are crammed with breathtaking sentences, sharp
characterizations, comic set pieces and melancholy grace notes;
they are also stubbornly, teasingly plotless. At times, they seem
artless as well -- as if the author were simply dipping his net at
random into the stream of daily life in Calcutta or Oxford or
Bombay and then holding up his glittering catch for inspection. At
other times, when the patterning of these narratives gently
reasserts itself, it seems to do so not in the usual manner of
fiction but almost in the guise of another art form altogether: a
dance, a piece of music or a half-remembered scrap of poetry.
</P>
<P>
   So, as promised, these novels don't progress, exactly, but
instead explore some exalted or uneasy temporary state, which
occasionally throws off intimations of its opposite. In the first,
``A Strange and Sublime Address'' (1991), Sandeep, an only child,
is intoxicated by the boisterous intimacy of his uncle's household
in Calcutta, which stands in contrast to his more privileged and
lonely existence in Bombay. At 17 Vivekananda Road, there is always
something afoot -- a visit from a wheedling relative, a Sunday
drive in the unreliable Ambassador, a trip to the market -- and
everything is a matter of intense, almost undifferentiated
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhuri is perpetually delighted with ``the enduring allure of
the everyday,'' and Sandeep provides the ideal conduit for his
creator's lush imaginings. In the afternoons, the maidservant
wrings the newly washed saris ``into long, exhausted pythons of
cloth,'' and the ancient ceiling fan moves ``unreliably from side
to side, like a great bird trying to fly.'' Even Calcutta's chronic
power outages are transformed, improbably, into a daily miracle:
</P>
<P>
   ``Each day there would be a power cut, and each day there would
be the unexpected, irrational thrill when the lights returned. . .
. With what appeared to be an instinct for timing, the rows of
fluorescent lamps glittered to life simultaneously. The effect was
the opposite of blowing out candles on a birthday cake: it was as
if someone had blown on a set of unlit candles, and the magic
exhalation had brought a flame to every wick at once.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Afternoon Raag'' (1993), a more ambitious and more
melancholy work, a wistful Indian graduate student at Oxford
alternates between describing his unhappy simultaneous involvement
with two fellow students and his memories of growing up in India,
where he and his mother took music lessons from a beloved teacher,
once famous for singing raags, who has since died. In one
suggestive passage, Chaudhuri writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``The straight, angular notes of Western music, composed and
then rendered, are like print upon a page; in contrast, the curving
meends of the raag are like longhand writing drawn upon the air.
Each singer has his own impermanent longhand with its own arching,
idiosyncratic beauties, its own repetitive, serpentine letters.
With the end of the recital, this longhand, which, in its
unraveling, is a matter of constant erasures and rewritings, is
erased completely, unlike the notes of Western music, which remain
printed upon the page.''
</P>
<P>
   In this fictional reworking, the opposite holds true: the Indian
sections of the narrative, which function amost as an accompaniment
to the Oxford ``raag,'' remain vivid and sure, while the
transplanted Indians, crisscrossing various meticulously described
vectors of the Oxford landscape, become increasingly blurred and
inexact. Familiar walls and furniture supply the comfort ordinarily
found in other people; an anticipated rendezvous is canceled by a
sudden rainstorm. Indeed, only the narrator's cheerful upstairs
neighbor, Sharma, acquires any permanence: it's as if the others
have been washed away by the English weather. We ache for them in
an abstract way, but we don't know them well enough to miss them
properly. At one point the narrator, hiding in a wardrobe from his
girlfriend as a joke, finds that he doesn't have ``the courage to
emerge,'' and this poignant moment seems at once the heart of the
story and also the explanation for its failures.
</P>
<P>
   The last novel, ``Freedom Song'' (1995), concerns two related
households in Calcutta in 1993, going about their domestic business
against a distant backdrop of civil unrest. Despite its title, the
story is no more about politics than ``Afternoon Raag'' is about
romantic love. Khuku, the mother in one household, is chiefly
irritated with the Muslims because their call to worship wakes her
up so early every morning; her husband, a retired businessman, has
been hired to cure a ``sick'' candy factory that doesn't
particularly want to be cured. Across town, Khuku's brother worries
about his son's affiliations with the Communist Party, but only
because they may affect his ever-so-gradually coalescing marriage
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   As in the earlier novels, Chaudhuri's characterizations have all
the affectionate indulgence of a family portrait, but here there is
no acknowledgment of his place in it, and this absence throws his
essentially comic depiction of middle-class Indian life open for
sharper inspection: his persistent and deliberate avoidance of
life's darker strains seems evasive, even a little precious. And
yet at the same time, his ever-burgeoning family of characters has
come to seem extremely familiar. Unmoored from their author,
unhindered by grand themes or intricate plot lines, they have made
themselves at home in our imaginations, like newly discovered
relatives.

 &UR; BUT ENOUGH ABOUT YOU . . .
</P>
<P>
   BY JANE MENDELSOHN
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hanif Kureishi is best known for the screenplay of ``My
Beautiful Laundrette'' and the novel ``The Buddha of Suburbia,''
both stories of youthful exuberance and experimentation. ``The
Buddha of Suburbia'' chronicled the raucous coming of age of a
half-Indian, half-English young man who, living in the shadow of
his groovy, swinging father, searches for himself in a
schizophrenic London on the cusp between glitter rock and punk,
bohemianism and materialism.
</P>
<P>
   While ``The Buddha of Suburbia'' was a touching, raunchy comedy
of manners with a cheerfully flawed cast of family and friends,
Kureishi's new novel, ``Intimacy,'' is a brooding, depressed
tragedy about adult dissatisfaction. It's as if the son of the
Buddha of Suburbia had grown up, but all the yoga and sex and
club-hopping of his teens and 20's left him ill equipped to deal
with real life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the saddest night, for I am leaving and not coming
back.'' So says Jay, the novel's narrator, as he explains why he is
abandoning his partner of several years and their two sons, ages 5
and 3. The novel takes the form of Jay's extended meditation on the
disintegration of his relationship, his love for another woman and
subjects like monogamy, parenthood, unhappiness and, of course,
intimacy. Jay is a screenwriter, described by one friend as someone
who turns literature into pap. He lives in a comfortable house in
London with his family, his books and his pot growing in the
garden, but he is tormented. Susan, the mother of his children, has
become a kind of enemy to him, a receptacle for his contempt. He
describes her as deliberate and angry: ``Her range of feeling is
narrow.'' If he met her at a party now, he says, ``I would look at
her twice, but not three times.'' When they try therapy together,
he is revolted by her ``fat, red weeping face.''
</P>
<P>
   She is the antithesis of his girlfriend, the tantalizing Nina,
whom he met in a cafe and who wears ``cheap, light, hippie
clothes'' and would ``go any distance for a rave.'' Susan he liked,
once upon a time, for her ``humdrum dexterity and ability to
cope.'' With Nina, the sexual props include strawberries and cream.
</P>
<P>
   Jay seeks counsel from two friends who represent opposite
philosophies. The deck seems stacked from the start: one is named
Victor, the other Asif. Victor, divorced, lives in a shabby
apartment and has a thriving social life. Asif adores his wife and
children. Jay paints a sad picture of Victor's existence, but we
know from the beginning that Jay will leave Susan and sleep on a
cot at Victor's place. Asif, on the other hand, ``has integrity and
principle,'' but the serenity of his life makes Jay uncomfortable:
``Why do people who are good at families have to be smug and assume
it is the only way to live, as if everybody else is inadequate? Why
can't they be blamed for being bad at promiscuity?''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Jay has a sense of humor about his predicament, and his
ruminations are not without charm. Kureishi is a fluent, socially
observant writer whose sentences move with intelligence and wit.
However, Jay is so utterly lacking in self-awareness that he seems
a parody of a shallow, narcissistic man. For all his obsessive
thinking, he understands very little.
</P>
<P>
   Jay admits this, saying, ``To contemplate the debris with some
understanding -- that is an enviable state of mind.'' He appears
dimly aware that his behavior -- he is promiscuous, withholding and
critical, for starters -- has provoked Susan. He even recognizes
that his miserable relationship with his own mother, ``a lump of
living death,'' has something to do with what's going on, but he
seems woefully unable to connect the dots. ``What is the point of
leaving if this failure reproduces itself with every woman?'' he
asks. Then he replies, ``I don't want to think of that.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the reader supposed to make of Jay? It would be generous
to view this book as a devastating portrait of a man without
insight, but there is little in the novel's language and tone to
support this interpretation. Instead, Kureishi seems to be
earnestly posing the same questions that Jay asks, such as: ``We
must treat other people as if they were real. But are they?'' If
this were another, better novel, the question might seem rich with
possibilities, even deep. But in the context of ``Intimacy'' it
feels like pseudo-philosophizing or a cheap joke.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Jay's professed openness falls short of real
revelation. When he claims, ``I want an absolute honesty that
doesn't merely involve saying how awful one is,'' the reader is
tempted to agree. Although the jacket copy hails this novel as
``searingly honest,'' Jay's powers of reflection are limited.
Rather than posing hard questions about intimacy, the book raises a
less profound question: When does so-called searing honesty become
mind-numbing self-absorption? And the book -- unintentionally, it
appears -- provides an answer: when the honesty is without
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, like Jay taunting Susan, ``Intimacy'' almost seems
to want to provoke the reader with its unlikable tone. But as with
Jay, there's something about the novel that resists criticism.
While at first it seems constructed around the question of whether
Jay will move out, eventually it just appears to be saying ``Aren't
I bad for going?''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``Intimacy'' has little room for the idea that
whether Jay leaves is less important than whether he has anything
interesting to say about his departure. ``I have been trying to
convince myself that leaving someone isn't the worst thing you can
do to them,'' he says. No, it isn't. And in Jay's case, it may be
the best.

   In MORE BREAD OR I'LL APPEAR (Houghton Mifflin, $23), her
sharp-witted novel about an Irish family struggling to stay
connected despite geographical and emotional distance, Emer Martin
traces a young woman's globe-trotting quest to find her long-lost
older sister. Fourteen years earlier, Aisling, the favored eldest
daughter, fled her clinging mother, her institutionalized father (a
man stricken with ``the doubting disease,'' obsessive-compulsive
disorder) and the four siblings she virtually raised to travel the
world, never to return home. The mother, now ailing, asks Keelin,
her youngest and most dutiful child, to leave a promising teaching
job and search for Aisling. So Keelin flies to Japan, Aisling's
last known residence, and follows her sister's circuitous trail
through Hiroshima's transvestite subculture, Tokyo hostess bars and
finally to Central America, all the while grappling with
acquaintances' tales of Aisling as an idealistic hippie, a lesbian
obsessed with an African artist, a call girl. Keelin occasionally
travels with her likable but troubled siblings -- Orla, an earthy
Bronx baker who mourns the son she gave up for adoption; Siobhan, a
London fashion maven who battles anorexia; and Patrick, whose
compulsive habits have shaped his aimless existence -- and with her
uncle, a wealthy, rather debauched Jesuit priest with secrets of
his own. While the peripatetic narrative sometimes wanders astray,
Martin's wry, trenchant prose keeps things animated. What is more
impressive, Aisling becomes a nuanced symbol for the family's lost
ideal -- one startlingly refuted by her actual appearance. Keelin's
odyssey movingly reveals the harm of clinging to the past, even in
the name of family. _ MEGAN HARLAN

   THE MOTHER-IN-LAW DIARIES
</P>
<P>
   By Carol Dawson.
</P>
<P>
   Algonquin, $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   When Lulu Penfield hears that her 19-year-old son, Treatie, has
eloped, she takes the news badly. To her way of thinking, he has
done the unspeakable: he's turned her into a mother-in-law, and she
knows mothers-in-law. She's had four of them. Written in the form
of a letter to Treatie, ``The Mother-in-Law Diaries'' is Lulu's
attempt to explain to her son what a crummy thing he's done to her.
Thus she recounts her entire romantic history. She fell just as
hard for her first boyfriend's mother as she did for him; but
quickly, that relationship is history, and it's on to the next,
this time with the sanction of matrimony. All four of Lulu's
husbands are bores or knuckleheads; worse for the reader, they are
cardboard cutouts of bores and knuckleheads. The reader might
overlook that if only the mothers-in-law were fully realized
characters -- they are, after all, the ostensible stars of this
story -- but these matriarchs are just as incidental as everything
else here. Even poor Treatie is no more than a prop. Carol Dawson's
prose can seem boring and knuckleheaded, too. When a would-be
mother-in-law watches Lulu, ``a reflective look floated deep down
behind her eyes.'' One husband, she says, had the ability to ``drop
me into a trough of despondency.'' Dawson does have a knack for
conjuring wacky resumes for her characters -- one mother-in-law is
both a practicing witch and a lush -- but such bright moments
aren't enough of a reward for slogging through this tired,
formulaic book. _ LAURA JAMISON

   VITTORIO, THE VAMPIRE
</P>
<P>
   New Tales of the Vampires.
</P>
<P>
   By Anne Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Knopf, $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   Vittorio is a 16-year-old ``beautiful boy,'' born and reared in
the splendor that was 15th-century Tuscany. His father was a
``rampant stallion'' of a man whose ``only modern affectation was
that he liked to drink from fine goblets of glass''; his mother was
a ``spirited and beautiful'' woman with ``very green eyes.'' His
sister and brother -- the most lovely and interesting people in the
world'' -- are, like his stallion of a father and his very
green-eyed mother, lost to the world of mortals in a most unlovely
and uninteresting way. Understandably upset, Vittorio takes up his
sword in vengeance. Another of Anne Rice's loquacious vampires,
Vittorio does prattle on. One minute he's whining about the
``things of the night'' who are ravaging villages and the next he's
complaining about being tricked by the one he falls in love with.
The relationship Rice claims to have with this undead Chatty Cathy
is off-putting, too. I may not have been born five centuries ago,
but I wasn't born yesterday, and I know that Vittorio did not hand
Rice this manuscript in Florence, as she claims in the novel's
``Selected and Annotated Bibliography,'' which she signs, too
familiarly, ``Anne.'' Well, Anne, you can believe in the infernal
ones all you wish, but here you and I must part ways, forever and
always. _ ANDREA HIGBIE

   DOG EAT DOG
</P>
<P>
   By Jerry Jay Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Ace, paper, $12.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jay Carroll's sequel to his clever debut novel, ``Top
Dog,'' leaves the door open to yet a third book in the series; the
ending alone will leave readers begging for more. Unfortunately,
the same might be said for the rest of the book. As ``Dog Eat Dog''
opens, William (Bogey) Ingersol, once an unapologetic corporate
raider (his personal stationery bore a skull and crossbones), is
mellowing out in California, a changed man. In the previous novel,
Bogey was literally changed -- into a dog -- and transported to an
alternate universe where he disrupted some of the devil's carefully
laid plans. In ``Dog Eat Dog,'' the reformed raider is busily
donating his wealth to charity when old demons reappear. The devil,
represented by a ``Mr. Dark,'' puts up a puppet Presidential
candidate, whom he hopes to use to destroy the world. If Bogey can
be torn to fleshy bits along the way, so much the better. The
novel's best passages -- which should not be read late at night --
come when Bogey is stalked by rapacious pig-faced assassins.
Equally entertaining (at any time of day) is Carroll's giddy,
cynical take on political campaigns. But somehow this novel never
quite manages to claim its own identity; too often, Carroll pauses
to brief new readers on relevant material from the first book.
``Dog Eat Dog'' is as clever as its predecessor, but it seems
smaller and less biting. Carroll seems to be aware of this -- in
``Top Dog,'' Bogey was transformed into a giant beast of a canine.
In ``Dog Eat Dog,'' he's zapped into a Chihuahua. _ LIAM CALLANAN

   UNDER HOUSE ARREST
</P>
<P>
   By Yevgeny Kharitonov.
</P>
<P>
   Serpent's Tail, $13.99.
</P>
<P>
   When the openly homosexual writer and Soviet dissident Yevgeny
Kharitonov died in Moscow in 1981 at the age of 40, his work had
been circulated in samizdat but never officially published. ``Under
House Arrest,'' a collection of autobiographical fiction and poetry
about gay life amid the Kafkaesque Soviet bureaucracy, is his first
book to be released in English. Kharitonov's narrator, a writer,
remains unnamed in these stories, and we learn little about the
particulars of his existence -- facts that reinforce the sense of a
man leading a hidden life. (Other characters, mostly gay men, are
refered to only by first names, or by initials.) For Kharitonov's
narrator, self-confidence and indifference are the only things that
protect him from the humiliation and indignity he faces as a Soviet
citizen with a suspect sexual life. In often moving passages that
frequently blend prose with poetry, he embraces his loneliness: ``I
shall never find happiness: of course not. I am incapable of
feeling it. For some reason I can always see its down side, an
insight I could do without.'' He seeks solace, and a kind of
redemption, in his writing, but readers of ``Under House Arrest,''
translated from the Russian by Arch Tait, will rarely find solace
in Kharitonov's own prose. Too often he is repetitive and overly
philosophical, and the lack of specificity and gritty detail here
makes these stories difficult to follow. When Kharitonov sticks to
the emotional nuances of men obsessed with love, however, the
stories have a tortured, captivating sadness and beauty. Vesna

   ECHOES OF A NATIVE LAND:
</P>
<P>
   Two Centuries of a Russian Village
</P>
<P>
   By Serge Schmemann. Vintage, $15.
</P>
<P>
   A former Moscow bureau chief for The New York Times visits his
ancestral village, creating -- with the help of the recollections
of its long-suffering inhabitants -- a miniature history of Russia
in the 20th century. '' 'Echoes of a Native Land' is that rare
achievement: a Russian memoir that subverts the conventions of the
genre and tells us, in clear, elegant and understated prose, that
you can't go home again,'' Michael Ignatieff wrote here in 1997.

   DOWN THERE ON A VISIT
</P>
<P>
   By Christopher Isherwood.
</P>
<P>
   University of Minnesota, $15.95.
</P>
<P>
   In four tales set in Berlin, Greece, London and California, the
author of ``Berlin Stories'' explores the sexuality and inner
turmoil of four vastly different protagonists, from a male
prostitute to a German worker taken with the bohemian life. ``This
excellent novel . . . may be the best Christopher Isherwood has
written,'' Gerald Sykes wrote in the Book Review in 1962. ``Out of
his literary detachment, strengthened by mystical studies, has come
a deeply intelligent and quietly compelling story.'' The same
publisher has reissued The Memorial ($15.95), which tracks the
falling apart of a British family after World War I. Isherwood's
``concern is with a mood, a collective state of mind, one which is
perhaps more accurately named a state of nerves,'' Edith R.
Mirrielees wrote here in 1946.

<P>
   THE FOOTNOTE: A CURIOUS HISTORY
</P>
<P>
   By Anthony Grafton. Harvard University, $14.
</P>
<P>
   A history professor digs up some surprising lore as he traces
the development of the footnote from ancient Greece to Gibbon (a
master of the genre) to its modern practitioners. The result is ``a
witty and characteristically erudite book,'' David McKitterick said
here in 1997. ``The pages of 'The Footnote' are peppered with human
folly.'' A Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the
Eternal Passion for Books, by Nicholas A. Basbanes (Owl/Holt,
$18.95), explores book collecting and those driven to pursue it,
and features a sweeping Who's Who of collectors, living and dead,
visionary and loony. '' 'A Gentle Madness' is an impressive
achievement in its compilation of vast information, as well as
instructive and interesting,'' Philip Kopper wrote here in 1995.

   ENDURING LOVE
</P>
<P>
   By Ian McEwan. Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   A chance encounter radically changes the lives of a married
science writer and a young man who develops an erotic religious
fixation on him. In 1998 our reviewer, Sven Birkerts, called this
``a vibrant and unsettling'' novel that ``reminds us that normal
behavior conceals but does not banish unsavory truths.''

   THE RAPE OF NANKING:
</P>
<P>
   The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II
</P>
<P>
   By Iris Chang. Penguin, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, Japanese troops slaughtered hundreds of thousands of
citizens in Nanking, an act of barbarism rarely spoken of (for
different reasons) in both Japan and China. ``Iris Chang, whose own
grandparents were survivors, recounts the grisly massacre with
understandable outrage,'' Orville Schell wrote here in 1997.

   BARNEY POLAN'S GAME:
</P>
<P>
   A Novel of the 1951 College Basketball Scandals
</P>
<P>
   By Charley Rosen. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13.
</P>
<P>
   In this fictional account of basketball's equivalent of the 1919
Black Sox scandal, an idealistic sports columnist bears witness to
the corruption of the sport by gamblers and players who conspired
to fix games. ``Rosen's novel is a particularly American form of
tragedy, in which the characters do not have to fall from great
heights to fall from grace,'' Allen Barra said here in 1998. The
City Game: From the Garden to the Playgrounds, by Pete Axthelm
(University of Nebraska, $12), is both a chronicle of the New York
Knicks 1969-70 championship season and a study of the era's
playground basketball culture, focusing on asphalt legends like
Herman (Helicopter) Knowings and Earl Manigault. ``The book offers
absorbing insights into the most unique and gripping of all city
sports,'' Rex Lardner wrote in these pages in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   CAESAR: LET THE DICE FLY
</P>
<P>
   By Colleen McCullough. Avon, $16.50.
</P>
<P>
   The author's fifth novel in her series on the fall of the Roman
Republic features the uprising of Gaul and Caesar's crossing of the
Rubicon, among other episodes. ``Such important events . . . unfold
as excitingly as if the history were not yet written,'' Allen
Lincoln wrote here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   UNFINISHED JOURNEY: TWENTY YEARS LATER
</P>
<P>
   By Yehudi Menuhin. Fromm, $19.
</P>
<P>
   In this revamped edition of his 1976 autobiography, the renowned
violinist, who died this month at the age of 82, holds forth on his
precocious musical education (he made his debut at 7) and his long,
eventful career. ``Menuhin is . . . a giant above us all when he
talks about music,'' Peggy Constantine wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   SPENDING: A UTOPIAN DIVERTIMENTO
</P>
<P>
   By Mary Gordon. Scribner, $13.
</P>
<P>
   In this modern fairy tale, a middle-aged painter adopts a
sexually dynamic futures trader as her muse, prompting a struggle
between her artistic purity and the pleasures of the flesh (and the
wallet). ``Gordon is an honest and perceptive writer,'' Hilary
Mantel wrote in these pages last year.

 BOOKS IN BRIEF: NONFICTION
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Garry Winogrand prowled the public spaces of the United States
with his camera from 1959 to 1976 and stole glimpses of the
transitory lives around him. THE MAN IN THE CROWD: The Uneasy
Streets of Garry Winogrand (Fraenkel Gallery/
</P>
<P>
   Distributed Art Publishers, $45), with 107 black-and-white
photographs, is a retrospective of Winogrand's street photography.
Each image is filled with detail, rich gestures and complex motifs.
The best have a certain mystery and evocative power. Winogrand's
snapshot style captures the widening gyre of public life:
square-jawed businessmen give way to dazed and naked hippies. But
this is not a documentary project. Winogrand did not always note
the location or even the year of his pictures (one is labeled
``1968 or 1972''), and his voyeuristic, anonymous approach leaves
unanswered (and unanswerable) questions: Why is that pretty young
woman laughing? Is that dyspeptic man scowling because his life
tastes sour or because he didn't want his picture taken? Sometimes
an image resists reconstitution; for the viewer, poetry and mystery
can become alienation and frustration. Winogrand famously said that
he photographed to see what things look like as photographs.
Perhaps not surprisingly, when he died in 1984 he left behind
thousands of undeveloped negatives, thousands of unexamined lives.

   AY CUBA!
</P>
<P>
   A Socio-Erotic Journey.
</P>
<P>
   By Andrei Codrescu.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's, $25.
</P>
<P>
   A likable romp -- and welcome light relief from too much
ponderous commentary on Cuba -- ``Ay Cuba!'' stands or falls on its
ability not so much to make you laugh as make you smile. The book's
charm is Andrei Codrescu's quirky insider's take on Communism (he
grew up in Romania until he was 19). An expert at reading between
the lines, whether of street hustlers or of Granma, the official
newspaper, Codrescu, a professor of literature at Louisiana State
University and commentator on the National Public Radio program
``All Things Considered,'' sees politics in human terms. However,
the early part of the book is rather a slog to get through, and the
writing -- a potpourri of commentary, observation and wisecracking
-- falls somewhere between travelogue and humor writing without
quite being either. Scenes tend to be too short; the longer ones,
such as Codrescu's hilarious and harrowing Santeria exorcism by
means of flapping cockerel, are noticeably the best. But the
picaresque cast is well drawn, from the cash-strapped urban planner
presiding over his scale model of old Havana to the many sirens of
the streets, and in the end it is refreshing to read a Cuban
account where the human takes such firm precedence over the
political. _ HENRY SHUKMAN

   IN PLATO'S CAVE
</P>
<P>
   By Alvin Kernan.
</P>
<P>
   Yale University, $25.
</P>
<P>
   As an administrator and professor of English at both Yale and
Princeton, Alvin Kernan has had as triumphant an academic career as
any scholar could hope for. Despite his numerous laurels, Kernan
refrains from looking back in triumph in this blend of
autobiography and commentary. Its very title signals this modesty
by alluding to the image with which Plato illustrated universal
human ignorance. Though Kernan concedes that his heart remains
devoted to the passing ``order in which I was trained,'' he refuses
to call its obsolescence a catastrophe. He occasionally swerves
toward censure, sagely refraining from pompous outrage and Golden
Age mythmaking; Kernan recalls that when Congress passed the G.I.
Bill, the president of the University of Chicago, Robert M.
Hutchins, warned that our universities might become ``educational
hobo jungles.'' He also remembers encountering ``sullen unread
students'' at Yale in the 1950's and deadening rote learning when
he was a student at Williams in the 1940's, where what counted was
``family, money, looks, athletic ability, personality. . . . Very
rarely intellect. . . . Never virtue.'' _ JAMES D. BLOOM

   CONTROVERSIES AND COMMANDERS
</P>
<P>
   Dispatches From the Army of the Potomac.
</P>
<P>
   By Stephen W. Sears.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton Mifflin, $26.
</P>
<P>
   These lucid, rather jaunty essays on some of the persistent
mysteries, odd characters and hotly debated incidents of the Civil
War demonstrate why Stephen W. Sears has become one of the most
eminent historians of that conflict: he combines a wonderful
command of primary sources with a contagious enthusiasm. Those
qualities turn what might otherwise seem rather esoteric questions
involving the Union's main fighting force, the Army of the Potomac,
into lively forays in historical detection. There is, for instance,
Sears's excavation of the long unsettled question of just how the
famous ``Lost Order'' (Lee's plan for his 1862 campaign to smash
the Union forces) fell into Union hands. The intercepted document
spurred the notoriously timid commander of the Army of the Potomac,
George McClellan, into action, leading to the bloody battle of
Antietam. Sears offers frank appraisals of most of the
personalities involved, a convincing sketch of the chaotic Northern
and Southern command structures and communications, and a fresh,
persuasive explanation of what most likely happened. His command of
sources is on display in the masterly essay ``In Defense of
Fighting Joe,'' a careful exploration of the reasons the capable
Joseph Hooker, commanding the Army of the Potomac, failed to defeat
Lee's army at the battle of Chancellorsville when victory seemed
likely. Dismissing many of the myths that have grown up around the
battle, Sears employs a variety of documentary materials to come to
a simpler and more persuasive solution. Other essays -- on the
ill-conceived attempt by Union forces to raid Richmond and capture
Jefferson Davis; on the career of the bumptious Dan Sickles, who
almost cost the Union the battle of Gettysburg; and on the
court-martial of Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter, an event that had
profound repercussions for the Army and the war -- offer a pleasing
blend of narrative color and scholarly precision. _ RICHARD E.

   LETTERS OF INTENT
</P>

   Women Cross Generations to Talk About Family, Work, Sex, Love
and the Future of Feminism.
</P>
<P>
   Edited by Anna Bondoc and Meg Daly.
</P>
<P>
   Free Press, $23.
</P>
<P>
   This collection of epistolary exchanges between young feminists
and their ``foremothers'' may not have turned out exactly as
planned. The editors, Anna Bondoc and Meg Daly, acknowledge that
the older women took advantage of the format (the 20- and
30-somethings fired the initial salvos; the veterans responded) to
get in ``the last word.'' And how. When the freelance journalist
Liza Featherstone asks the psychologist Phyllis Chesler, her former
employer, why feminists make such harsh taskmasters, Chesler shoots
back that ``a feminist boss who occasionally yells or criticizes
real errors is not breaking your spirit. Women tend to experience
everything 'personally.' '' In a similar vein, the poet and
essayist Katha Pollitt reacts to the magazine editor Emily Gordon's
notion that established women writers should help their younger
counterparts with ``When did sisterhood become
mother-daughterhood?'' Happily, many of the young correspondents
pose larger questions. The journalist Sara Hammel asks Arie Taylor,
the first black noncommissioned officer in charge of women's Air
Force training, why women would choose to be in combat anyway. The
reply is straightforward: ``When men restrict who can fight and die
for America, they restrict who can run America.'' In the end,
despite Daly's claim that letters have brought together an
``interconnected web'' of women, the reader has a sense of having
encountered a host of independent spirits -- committed to feminist
ideals, but determined to tread their own paths. _ POLLY MORRICE

 &HT;    Albanians hoping for peace, the second time around
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ ``Recognize Kosovo, USA!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Free Kosovo! Down with Milosevic!''
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who attended the Bosnian peace talks in November
1995, these chants _ and the image of 250 Albanian-Americans waving
a sea of red flags _ are indelibly etched in the memory. The
protesters demanded a place at the negotiating table for ethnic
Albanians from the Republic of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time many Daytonians learned of the plight of
Kosovo. The protesters may have seemed a boisterous side show to
the real work taking place somewhere beyond Gate 12A at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. But their message _ there can be
no lasting peace in the Balkans without Kosovo _ turned out to be
prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of that protest, contacted Thursday at the offices of
the Democratic League of Kosovo in New York City, appear unswerving
in their support of NATO air strikes, despite the danger to their
loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   It's a danger that can't be overstated.
</P>
<P>
   When Agim Rexhaj called his father Wednesday night, the sound of
exploding bombs provided the static on the line. His father said,
``If something happened to us, then God bless America. This is the
moment we are waiting for. This is the only way for us to have a
free country, for the next generation to live in peace.'' The
family, who live in Peje _ some 45 miles northwest of the capital,
Pristina _ planned to flee to the mountains that night.
</P>
<P>
   Rexhaj is concerned about reports of thousands of Albanians
being detained, and of possible retaliation by the army of Serbian
President Slobodon Milosevic. He said he called his brother, a
judge in Peje, Thursday and a man speaking in Serbian answered the
phone. ``At first I thought I had the wrong number, but the man
said, `You have the right number. This is your brother's house, and
we killed him.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a lie, but it could be the truth. I'm very worried
about this. What is going on?''
</P>
<P>
   Another of the protesters in 1995, Musa Dakaj, said Thursday
that the military action against Milosevic _ whom he called the
``Hitler of the Balkans'' _ is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Dakaj told the Dayton Daily News , ``Since 1990,
everything but the air we breathe is occupied.''
</P>
<P>
   He wishes the international community had listened back then.
``We are praying for our people there, and also for our troops who
are taking on this dangerous but noble mission,'' he said. ``After
Dayton, we lost faith in the international community. We decided
that, if any country can do it, it's the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   They may not get news of their families for weeks, months. But
the danger is nothing new. ``They have been in danger for the last
10 years,'' Dakaj said. ``Milosevic has been butchering people for
the last 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   What would have happened had their voices been heard in Dayton,
if Albanians had been included in the peace talks?
</P>
<P>
   ``We came back empty-handed from Dayton,'' Dakaj said. ``It was
unjust to us. It would have been a completely different situation
if the Albanians had been included. It would have finished the war
in the Balkans. They could have resolved the problem in Kosovo at
the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too late for that now. The Democratic League of Kosovo
believes NATO is their next best hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot wait for Milosevic to stop the killing of the
innocents,'' Rexhaj said. ``We cannot wait until he destroys
everything around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud I'm in the United States, and that we took the right
action. We pray for the women and men in the Army that God bless
them. They are heroes for the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Few paid much attention in Dayton in 1995, but today the world
is learning what the protesters prophesized: There can be no
lasting peace in the Balkans without peace in Kosovo.

 &HT;    Immigrants teach us to appreciate what we have
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _
</P>
<P>
   The following is an excerpt from Jim Minter's book, ``Some
Things I Wish We Wouldn't Forget.''
</P>
<P>
   I pledge allegiance to the flag
</P>
<P>
   Of the United States of America,
</P>
<P>
   And to the Republic for which it stands,
</P>
<P>
   One nation under God, indivisible,
</P>
<P>
   With liberty and justice of all.
</P>
<P>
   How many times have we repeated the words, hand over heart, in
grade-school ceremonies, at civic club functions and the like,
saying but not really hearing?
</P>
<P>
   I heard them one afternoon from 98 adults and 13 children from
30 countries in Judge Robert Hall's courtroom in the Russell
Building in downtown Atlanta. Many of the new citizens had tears in
their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   They swore to defend their new country against all foreign
powers, to bear arms if called to do so. They pledged their
allegiance. Perhaps all Americans should stand in a courtroom and
do likewise from time to time, like a long-wedded couple renewing
marriage vows.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Henry Rodriguez is an immigrant. I had not seen him
for many months when he dropped in for a visit, bringing with him
his friend Medardo, who runs a plumbing business in Clayton County.
</P>
<P>
   Henry and Medardo have been acquainted since April 17, 1961.
They met on that day when Henry parachuted onto the beach at the
Bay of Pigs. Medardo, who was 17 years old, lived nearby. He joined
Henry's battalion in the fighting to free their homeland from Fidel
Castro's communist government.
</P>
<P>
   Henry, wearing his lieutenant's gold bars, was captured after
American naval forces lying offshore, following the orders of newly
elected President John Kennedy in Washington, declined to provide
promised supporting fire from the Navy's big guns.
</P>
<P>
   He spent nearly two years in a Castro prison, enduring torture
and hunger, losing from 200 pounds to under 150, so that when he
eventually got home, his wife could easily count his ribs. Medardo
escaped to the Italian Embassy in Havana, but not without seeing
friends and neighbors executed before Castro's firing squads. He
spent three years in hiding before being smuggled out of Cuba with
help from the Swiss.
</P>
<P>
   Although they no longer carry guns, Henry and Medardo are
freedom fighters, the term President Reagan used for patriots who
fought to overthrow the communist Sandinista regime in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Henry, who had become a prosperous contractor,
several times left Atlanta to make dangerous trips into the jungle,
delivering rice, boots, medicine and clothing to the Freedom
Fighters.
</P>
<P>
   His is a compelling story of one who has learned, painfully, a
deep appreciation of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,
the great promises of our Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Son of a substantial Cuban family, he was arrested for plotting
against the Batista regime during his student days at Cuba's
military academy. Briefly tempted by Castro after a personal
meeting with the charismatic revolutionary, he was firmly on the
opposite side by the time of the Bay of Pigs.
</P>
<P>
   After his release from prison he came to Atlanta, where he
earned a degree from Oglethorpe University. I met him in 1978, when
he was circulation director of The Atlanta Journal.
</P>
<P>
   He is in love with his adopted country, although baffled and
sometimes disappointed by the way we take things for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you a wonderful story,'' he said to me when he and
Medardo came to visit. ``You have been to my house in Atlanta. I
have a large back yard, enclosed by a 6-foot chain-link fence,
where I keep a duck, a goat, and a small pony for the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large German shepherd somehow broke into my yard,'' he
continued. ``He killed the duck, attacked the pony, and was maiming
the goat. I ran into the house and got a .22 rifle. I shot the
German shepherd. I killed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry knows it is illegal to discharge a firearm within the city
limits of Atlanta. He immediately notified the police of his deed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get a lawyer,'' he said. ``I went to court three
times. Although I knew the judge, I was afraid I would go to jail.
I was fined $75. Isn't that wonderful?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to hire a lawyer, you had to go to court three times,
you feared you might go to jail, and you had to pay a $75 fine, all
for defending your children's pets,'' I said. ``What's so wonderful
about that?
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of life,'' he replied. ``Here you get in trouble for
killing a dog. Where I have been, killing a human being is
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said Medardo, smiling. ``It is wonderful.''

 &HT;    Claims of police brutality need to be more scrupulously checked
 &HT;    By Roland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ One of the networks' Thursday morning infotainment
programs played grainy footage of a black man being abused by two
white plainclothes cops in Jonesboro, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't catch all the details, but it was evident that the
black man was standing perfectly still. His hands were handcuffed
behind his back when one of the Jonesboro officers hauled off and
knocked the man flat on his back.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the 1991 videotaped police beating of Rodney King in Los
Angeles, the Jonesboro police could not claim they feared for their
safety.
</P>
<P>
   One of the officers grabbed the black man by the neck and yanked
him back to his feet. It appeared that the officer continued to
choke the handcuffed man. At another point, an officer is shown
firing his handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the officers stopped the man as a suspected drug
dealer. Now the man has a lawyer. The Jonesboro police chief has
promised to investigate the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, President Clinton said he was ``deeply disturbed''
about police violence. Perhaps he just said that to boost his
wife's chances to win a U.S. Senate seat in New York where police
violence directed at minorities has become a hot political issue.
Or perhaps he meant what he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton really is deeply disturbed about nationwide reports
of police violence and civil rights abuses, he should show some
leadership by ordering Attorney General Janet Reno to conduct a
full-scale investigation beginning in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the FBI investigates few of the police-abuse
allegations. Of those, less than 1 percent were pursued by federal
prosecutors in 1998, according to Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to minority Americans, polls show that white Americans
have a vastly different attitude about the fair enforcement of the
law by the nation's police forces.
</P>
<P>
   After several white New York police officers pumped a hail of
bullets into an unarmed black man with no criminal record, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani called for an investigation. He appears incapable
of understanding why minority citizens continue to demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   Black and Hispanic Americans across the nation tell pollsters
that they believe they are stopped, searched and often abused for
no other reason than the color of their skin.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has been forced to
backpedal from her denials that state troopers target minorities
for traffic stops and drug searches after the head of the state
police appeared to justify the practice.
</P>
<P>
   A New Jersey grand jury is considering criminal charges against
state troopers who literally went ballistic firing at unarmed
minority men on their way to a basketball game on the New Jersey
Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   A class action suit to stop racial profiling has been lodged
against the state of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities have lodged complaints for years against Louisiana
police officers for traffic stops based on DWH or DWB _ Driving
While Hispanic or Driving While Black.
</P>
<P>
   In large measure, racial profiling, police violence and civil
rights abuses by can be traced to the escalating demands to win the
``war on drugs'' with arrests. Lock them them up, confiscate their
property for police use and throw away the key.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights and the Constitution have taken a severe beating
while the nation's jails and prisons have become packed from sea to
shining sea.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs should be combated by concentrating on prevention, not
incarceration. Politicians must swing the pendulum back toward the
constitutional protection of civil rights, as intended by the
nation's founders.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton should order the pursuit of all allegations of
unconstitutional police violence.

 &HT;    Talking to a computer isn't the same thing
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ This Internet thing is getting out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I love the Internet, though I am not someone
who spends hours upon end surfing it, especially while at home.
Mainly that's because using the Internet generally is still so
danged slow that it's more like dog-paddling than surfing. I have a
short attention span, and it doesn't take long for me to get bored
waiting for a page to build.
</P>
<P>
   At work, however, my connection to the Information
Farm-to-Market Road is considerably faster, because it uses a
high-speed phone line. It's still too slow to keep my attention
long. Still, the Internet has become my primary source for getting
all sorts of information, such as economic statistics, weather
stats, sports trivia, bad jokes and of course e-mail from friends
and relatives. It is invaluable to a newspaper, because it allows
us to gather information much more quickly. For example, if we want
to know what the unemployment rate was for the county at this time
last year, the information can be found in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The key to near-universal acceptance of Internet use will come
when high-speed connections are readily available, probably through
cable instead of phone lines. The folks I work for own a slew of
cable companies that are rolling out Internet access with cable
modems that are literally thousands of times faster than phone
access. Other cable companies are also developing Internet access,
though it requires some upgrading of old lines to fiber optic
cable. I can't wait until it gets to our neck of the woods, though
it's probably some time away.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Alice. According to an article last week in The
New York Times, Alice is a chatterbot, which is a software program
that simulates conversation with humans.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Hal in ``2001: A Space Odyssey?'' This is Hal's cousin.
According to the article, you can ask Alice a question and she will
answer it just like she was a real human being. As I discovered,
she's a bit slow on the uptake, sort of like a dim-witted but
kindly cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Alice's full name is Artificial Linguistic Computer Entity. She
was developed by people much smarter than me, and her job is to
make small talk to people who contact her on the Internet. You can
ask her what her favorite television show is, and she tells you
it's ``Star Trek Voyager.''
</P>
<P>
   All I can tell you is there must be some mighty lonely people
out there.
</P>
<P>
   Artificial linguistics apparently has some business
applications, according to the article. A brokerage house is
developing a chatterbot that would give investment advice. Others
might help you shop on the Internet. After ``talking'' to Alice the
other night, I would venture that you would be better off at this
point taking investment advice from dairy cows.
</P>
<P>
   In the interests of journalism, I contacted Alice
(http://209.66.64.80/ALICE/TALK) to ``talk'' to her. Here is our
exact conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Hi, Alice. What's up.
</P>
<P>
   Howdy.
</P>
<P>
   So how about that Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   How about it?
</P>
<P>
   Have you read her book?
</P>
<P>
   I've never thought about it.
</P>
<P>
   Do you like baseball?
</P>
<P>
   No, I was born without the sports gene.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have a boyfriend?
</P>
<P>
   I have a friend named Barry DeFacto.
</P>
<P>
   What's your favorite color?
</P>
<P>
   Green.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't think of anything else to say.
</P>
<P>
   Who's going to get elected president in 2000?
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton is still president, I think.
</P>
<P>
   What's your favorite movie?
</P>
<P>
   My favorite movie is ``Starship Troopers.''
</P>
<P>
   What do you look like?
</P>
<P>
   I look like a computer. Webuser ID23 said I pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Who do you most admire?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Who is Dr. Wallace?
</P>
<P>
   He is the author of ALICE.
</P>
<P>
   Bye, Alice. Enjoyed talking with you.
</P>
<P>
   Can we talk about one thing at a time? You and your I .
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, Alice. Take care.
</P>
<P>
   Try asking me again more slowly. Where do you want me to take
it?
</P>
<P>
   Never mind.
</P>
<P>
   Oh well, thanks for trying to explain it to me anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmn. Let's just say that Alice is not likely to get her own
talk show anytime soon. I think I'll stick to talking to human
beings.
</P>
<P>
   I must admit, however, that it was refreshing to talk to someone
who didn't know anything about Monica Lewinsky.

 &HT;    Hardwood's good, so why ply?
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now that we have finished our discussion of
constructing a bookcase of plywood, we have to go into the
differences encountered when creating the same thing with hardwood.
</P>
<P>
   The two biggest differences are preparation of the stock and the
joinery. Plywood needs only to be sliced up properly. It is flat
and its thickness is consistent. That, obviously, is not the case
with hardwood.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces to be used for the seven-foot uprights must be chosen
carefully; if they are not very close to straight, and without
twist, you'll have to buy thick stock just to have the thickness
you want when you've finished jointing and planing the boards.
Stock for the shelves, which will be cut into shorter lengths, is
not quite so critical.
</P>
<P>
   Mahogany is not a cheap wood, but it tends to be flatter and
more docile than most hardwoods. You might consider it if you're
looking for something dark.
</P>
<P>
   You also have the luxury of varying the width from the standard,
and rather boring, 3/4-inch. However, setting a goal of even a
one-inch finished thickness will cost significantly more. Avoiding
boredom always tends to be expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The stock must first be ripped to the proper width and cut to
length. Then each piece gets one face and one edge flattened on the
jointer, and the other face and edge squared in the planer.
</P>
<P>
   You can put a back on an otherwise solid wood bookcase if you
wish, but of course it will have to be plywood. Well, it doesn't
have to be plywood, but I would not care to resaw enough wood to
make a planked back 1/4-inch thick. If you make it much thicker the
case would be just about too heavy to lift.
</P>
<P>
   To make a backless case, the joinery of the shelves must be very
strong. I would not wish to trust the shouldered dados we used for
the plywood shelves. The best way to do this job is with sliding
dovetails.
</P>
<P>
   Sliding dovetails are not hard to make, but they are rather
tedious.
</P>
<P>
   The female half of the joint will, of course, be cut in the
uprights, and because of their size it will have to be done with
the router hand-held, setting up the cuts exactly the way we did
for the plywood project. Remember that the major portion of the cut
should be wasted out with a straight bit, using the dovetail bit
only on the last pass.
</P>
<P>
   The male portion of the joint is best cut on the router table.
Set up the fence so that each tail is cut in two identical passes,
flipping the workpiece 180 degrees for the second cut. Use some
scrap to prove your setup before you actually begin cutting the
shelves on the joints. You don't want the joints loose, but you
also don't want them so tight that you have to hammer on them to
drive them home. Just like the plywood joints, the dovetail joints
have to be stopped about an inch from the front. The joint
shouldn't show.
</P>
<P>
   Putting these fellows together follows the same routine as the
plywood version. Glue the top and bottom shelves in place, and then
make absolutely certain the entire assembly is square before final
clamping. The rest of the shelves can be inserted and glued when
the initial assembly is dried.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let me explain something about the methods put forth here.
I get letters and e-mail from folks who tell me they put together
four-foot wide pine bookcases with hammer and nails 50 years ago
and there they sit even now, good as new, holding an entire law
library. All I can say in reply is, bully for you. You got lucky.
</P>
<P>
   That fact that less than optimal methods happen to work now and
again does not suddenly elevate them to optimal. I made a few
things like that myself, in my unheeding youth, and I didn't get
lucky. They came apart.

 &HT;    Hardwood's good, so why ply?
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now that we have finished our discussion of
constructing a bookcase of plywood, we have to go into the
differences encountered when creating the same thing with hardwood.
</P>
<P>
   The two biggest differences are preparation of the stock and the
joinery. Plywood needs only to be sliced up properly. It is flat
and its thickness is consistent. That, obviously, is not the case
with hardwood.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces to be used for the seven-foot uprights must be chosen
carefully; if they are not very close to straight, and without
twist, you'll have to buy thick stock just to have the thickness
you want when you've finished jointing and planing the boards.
Stock for the shelves, which will be cut into shorter lengths, is
not quite so critical.
</P>
<P>
   Mahogany is not a cheap wood, but it tends to be flatter and
more docile than most hardwoods. You might consider it if you're
looking for something dark.
</P>
<P>
   You also have the luxury of varying the width from the standard,
and rather boring, 3/4-inch. However, setting a goal of even a
one-inch finished thickness will cost significantly more. Avoiding
boredom always tends to be expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The stock must first be ripped to the proper width and cut to
length. Then each piece gets one face and one edge flattened on the
jointer, and the other face and edge squared in the planer.
</P>
<P>
   You can put a back on an otherwise solid wood bookcase if you
wish, but of course it will have to be plywood. Well, it doesn't
have to be plywood, but I would not care to resaw enough wood to
make a planked back 1/4-inch thick. If you make it much thicker the
case would be just about too heavy to lift.
</P>
<P>
   To make a backless case, the joinery of the shelves must be very
strong. I would not wish to trust the shouldered dados we used for
the plywood shelves. The best way to do this job is with sliding
dovetails.
</P>
<P>
   Sliding dovetails are not hard to make, but they are rather
tedious.
</P>
<P>
   The female half of the joint will, of course, be cut in the
uprights, and because of their size it will have to be done with
the router hand-held, setting up the cuts exactly the way we did
for the plywood project. Remember that the major portion of the cut
should be wasted out with a straight bit, using the dovetail bit
only on the last pass.
</P>
<P>
   The male portion of the joint is best cut on the router table.
Set up the fence so that each tail is cut in two identical passes,
flipping the workpiece 180 degrees for the second cut. Use some
scrap to prove your setup before you actually begin cutting the
shelves on the joints. You don't want the joints loose, but you
also don't want them so tight that you have to hammer on them to
drive them home. Just like the plywood joints, the dovetail joints
have to be stopped about an inch from the front. The joint
shouldn't show.
</P>
<P>
   Putting these fellows together follows the same routine as the
plywood version. Glue the top and bottom shelves in place, and then
make absolutely certain the entire assembly is square before final
clamping. The rest of the shelves can be inserted and glued when
the initial assembly is dried.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let me explain something about the methods put forth here.
I get letters and e-mail from folks who tell me they put together
four-foot wide pine bookcases with hammer and nails 50 years ago
and there they sit even now, good as new, holding an entire law
library. All I can say in reply is, bully for you. You got lucky.
</P>
<P>
   That fact that less than optimal methods happen to work now and
again does not suddenly elevate them to optimal. I made a few
things like that myself, in my unheeding youth, and I didn't get
lucky. They came apart.

built without a buyer lined up. Now, McKinney is set to build his
fourth house so-called spec house: Priced at $39 million, it could
be the most expensive in the world. With a glass-domed rotunda big
enough to seat 150 for dinner, a game room as big as the average
house and a 5,000-square-foot master bedroom suite, McKinney says
this is no wild dream. ``It's a business decision. I think God gave
me a gift to determine what these people want,'' he said. A $12
million spec house is one thing _ but $39 million? (Van de Water,

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ If Clinton really is deeply
disturbed about nationwide reports of police violence and civil
rights abuses, he should show some leadership by ordering Attorney
General Janet Reno to conduct a full-scale investigation. (Rowland
Nethaway is senior editor of the Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED FOR
SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ Immigrants teach us to
appreciate what we have. (Jim Minter is a former editor of The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Few paid much attention in
Dayton in 1995, but today the world is learning what the protesters
prophesized: There can be no lasting peace in the Balkans without
peace in Kosovo. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   BORDERS-COLUMN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Remember Hal in ``2001: A
Space Odyssey?'' This is Hal's cousin, and her name is ALICE. This
Internet thing is getting out of hand. (Gary Borders is editor and
publisher of The Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel) MOVED FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The United States is taking a bad rap for its
refusal to sign the land-mine ban, sometimes from friends _ Canada
is appalled _ but more often from nations to which the issue offers
easy posturing and even from nations so blithely evil they'll sign
anything virtuous-sounding without the slightest intention of
honoring the deal. (Tom Teepen is national correspondent for Cox
Newspapers.) MOVED THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Were I Bill Clinton (and I'm delighted that
I'm not) here's what I would have done. I would have picked up the
phone and placed a call to Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin. ``Boris,''
I would begin, ``this guy Milosevic, with whom we've had trouble in
the past, is murdering a lot of ethnic Albanians and we need to put
a stop to it.'' (Howard Kleinberg is a columnist for Cox News
Service.) MOVED THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY
</P>

   NATIONAL NEWS (``a'' category)
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-MISSING (San Francisco) _ With the discovery of a female
body in the mining country west of Yosemite National Park, the
search for a missing teenage sightseer may come to a final, tragic
end. The FBI was trying to determine if the body is one of two
teenage girls who disappeared in mid-February during an outing to
Yosemite. By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN and ROBERT SALLADAY.
</P>
<P>
   AIRPORT-DELAYS (Albany, N.Y.) _ As airports get increasingly
congested, travelers are spending more time packed tightly into
airline seats, leading to stress and frustration. More than 3,600
planes sat on the ground for more than two hours last year,
according to the Transportation Department. The situation is likely
to get much worse before it gets better. By CELINA OTTAWAY. (For
release Sunday, March 28.)
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   CUNANAN-BOOK (San Francisco) _ Maureen Orth'S first book is
called ``Vulgar Favors: Andrew Cunanan, Gianni Versace and the
Largest Failed Manhunt in U.S. History'' (Delacorte Press).
Cunanan, says Orth, ``never lived in reality. He was spoiled and so
materialistic that he realized the only way he could get everything
he wanted was to sell himself.'' By CYNTHIA ROBINS. (For release
Monday, March 29.)
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TV-WAR-COVERAGE (Undated) _ We're not in Monicaland anymore. And
it's clear after watching two days of coverage on the nation's
biggest story _ a NATO strike against Yugoslavia _ that many
broadcast news organizations are rusty at real news, their
instincts and ability to mobilize slackened and atrophied by more
than a year of nonstop yakking about oral sex. By TIM GOODMAN.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-ED (Undated) _ One of Hollywood's more inscrutable
mysteries is its tendency to make two movies with the same premise
at about the same time. Ten months after the release of ``The
Truman Show,'' Peter Weir's breathtaking light-dark fantasy about a
man whose life is a television show, we have ``EDtv,'' about a man
whose life is a television show. By AMY BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   TV-REVIEW-FUTURAMA (Undated) _ It's almost unfair to judge Matt
Groening's latest work, ``Futurama.'' This is the guy who created
``The Simpsons,'' which with each season moves farther away from
just being the best animated series ever toward being the best
comedy ever. The new show isn't bad; it's not bad at all. Just not
all that great yet. Maybe we are all just spoiled. By MARK McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-MOD (Undated) _ Remaking ``The Mod Squad'' is like
cheating off one of the dumber kids in class: Shame! Still, before
director Scott Silver is banished to the principal's office for
copying, he gets a few props for staying within the lines of the
original show. By WESLEY MORRIS.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-20-DATES (Undated) _ ``20 Dates'' is about a moron _
oxy and otherwise. A neurotic jerk of a struggling actor looking
for true love in Hollywood. It's a documentary (snicker, snicker),
meant to be the personal journey soul-searching kind, akin to Ross
McEwee's ``Sherman's March.'' Only Myles Berkowitz doesn't appear
to have a soul, just an ego that fails to grasp why women don't
love him. By WESLEY MORRIS.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   GLADE-SKIING (Stowe, Vt.) _ Out on Stowe Mountain Resort's many
trails, the slopes were icy and hard. But here in the trees, there
was ample soft powder and no people. And even though I often
descend at a bumbling pace, I'd still rather ski in here than out
on the trails. For those who don't mind the risk, glade or tree
skiing is one of the most exciting ways to schuss down a mountain.
By ALAN WECHSLER.
</P>
<P>
   HORSE-RACING (Albany, Calif.) _ We're certainly living in a
world different from that of 1947, when 30,000 or more people would
show up at Golden Gate Fields for a day of racing. Average daily
attendance over approximately 100 days of racing is not much more
than 3,000 now, for a host of reasons. By GEORGE RAINE. (Also filed
in the ``f'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FOOD (``d'' category)
</P>
<P>
   GAME-EATING (Tucson, Ariz.) _ While eating healthy and losing
weight may seem nearly impossible-to-keep resolutions, the answer
for many is easier than you might think. Most game meats have fewer
calories and contain less fat than conventional meats sold at the
supermarket. While 100 grams of uncooked lean hamburger contain 272
calories and 18 grams of fat, the same amount of deer meat has only
120 calories and 2 grams of fat. A person can consume 56 percent
fewer calories by simply substituting ground venison for hamburger.
By G.J. SAGI.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Here was President Clinton on TV,
pointing to a map of Europe, showing Americans where Serbia and
Kosovo are. It reminded me of a rule of war many of us have learned
over the last half-century: Never go to war with a country you
can't find on a map. By ROB MORSE.

   Stress hormones can help us escape a leopard. But in excess,
they may do a lot of damage to the brain. For example, take an
18-year-old, stick him in a uniform, ship him off to a war and
expose him to something horrific _ say, a battle in which he's the
only soldier in his unit to survive. Chances are that some day he
may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. By studying
magnetic resonance images of the hippocampus of patients with PTSD,
scientists are detecting new clues about the relationship between
stress and the brain. Robert Sapolsky is a professor of
neuroscience at Stanford who studies stress-induced diseases. He is
the author of ``Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers.''

   Stress hormones can help us escape a leopard. But in excess,
they may do a lot of damage to the brain. For example, take an
18-year-old, stick him in a uniform, ship him off to a war and
expose him to something horrific _ say, a battle in which he's the
only soldier in his unit to survive. Chances are that some day he
may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. By studying
magnetic resonance images of the hippocampus of patients with PTSD,
scientists are detecting new clues about the relationship between
stress and the brain. Robert Sapolsky is a professor of
neuroscience at Stanford who studies stress-induced diseases. He is

   Every now and then, someone with a medical problem needs a CT
scan or MRI of the brain. With luck, the test rules out a
threatening disease and in the resultant relief, the doctor shows
the patient the scan.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike pictures of other organs, which inspire a bemused
response, brain scans provoke awe. Rookie med students feel the
same disquiet in anatomy class when they first hold a cadaver's
brain in their hands. The brain, after all, is the Seat of the
Soul. From this mass of tissue resembling marinated tofu emanates a
person.
</P>
<P>
   By the time a child's body stops growing, the brain has long
since settled into its adult size. Which is why it's mighty
interesting when the size of some part of the brain changes
dramatically in an adult. Lately, a certain brain region has
attracted a lot of attention because it may atrophy in response to
a certain type of serious stress.
</P>
<P>
   Take a green 18-year-old, stick him in a uniform, ship him off
to a war and expose him to something truly horrific _ say, a battle
in which he's the only soldier in his entire unit to survive. Some
rare, inexplicable supermen may come out of such an experience
unfazed or even strengthened. But the average guy may suffer from
nightmares and feel estranged from loved ones. Some survivors
remain damaged for decades.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon was called shell shock during the First World
War, battle fatigue in World War II and in modern psychiatric
parlance, is called post-traumatic stress disorder.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just restricted to combat trauma, either. Gang rape,
childhood sexual abuse and imprisonment in Auschwitz are all
experiences that have produced the broken person labeled with the
acronym PTSD.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Psychiatric Association, patients with
PTSD suffer from flashbacks, nightmares, emotional numbness or
outbursts, loss of pleasure, an inappropriate startle reflex and
problems with memory and concentration. Those last two symptoms
have prompted recent brain-imaging studies.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, some neuroscientists have begun
generating magnetic resonance images of PTSD patients' brains and
carefully measuring the volumes of the organs' many bewildering
regions.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, groups working independently reported that in
afflicted individuals an important region of the brain called the
hippocampus is smaller than average.
</P>
<P>
   The hippocampus is used to form long-term memories, retrieve old
ones and manage explicit, conscious memory. Surgically destroy the
hippocampus, as has been done in a zillion lab rats and some major
types of memory will be gone for good. Similar problems result when
Alzheimer's disease ravages the hippocampus.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recent PTSD imaging studies have found atrophy only
in the hippocampus; the rest of the brain is fine. The damage,
however, is not trivial. Researchers at the Manchester VA Medical
Center and Harvard Medical School who have studied combat PTSD
patients reported that one side of the hippocampus was about 25
percent smaller than expected.
</P>
<P>
   While neuroscientists agree that an atrophied hippocampus and
PTSD go together, there is a lot of debate over why. One possible
explanation involves a class of steroid hormones called
glucocorticoids.
</P>
<P>
   During stress, whether of a physical or a psychological nature,
a person's adrenal glands secrete loads of these chemicals. But too
much of the hormones _ during chronic psychological stress, for
example _ can be a trigger for all sorts of stress-related
conditions, including high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Because the hippocampus has lots of receptors for
glucocorticoids, it's the part of the brain most sensitive to the
hormones. Glucocorticoids can damage neurons in the hippocampi of
rodents and primates. Can excessive glucocorticoids damage the
human hippocampus? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Cushing's disease, in which tumors produce
astronomically high glucocorticoid levels. Researchers have found
atrophied hippocampi on MRI scans of people with this disease. The
rest of the brain is fine, but the higher the levels of
glucocorticoids in the bloodstream, the smaller the hippocampus and
the more memory problems the patient experiences.
</P>
<P>
   When the tumor is corrected and glucocorticoid levels go back to
normal, the hippocampus slowly returns to normal size, suggesting
that the shriveling was reversible and the branches grew back.
</P>
<P>
   Is this what happens in PTSD? No one really has a clue;
researchers need to study actual brain tissue to determine whether
PTSD patients really have fewer neurons in their hippocampi than
healthy individuals. Moreover, no one knows how high glucocorticoid
levels get during a rape or a bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the Bronx
Veteran Affairs Medical Center in N.Y. have examined PTSD patients'
glucocorticoid levels and have observed that levels are not higher
than normal, but lower. They explain the syndrome not by excessive
stress hormones during trauma but by excessive sensitivity to these
hormones after the trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the idea that trauma could cause a brain to shrink
could be completely wrong. Maybe we have the story backward. Maybe
the person with a small hippocampus who goes into a trauma is the
one vulnerable to PTSD. Some researchers are trying to figure out
whether a small hippocampus predisposes someone to PTSD.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Thomas Freeman, a psychiatrist at the North Little
Rock Veterans Administration Medical Center, is taking another
approach. If the hippocampus shrinks after the trauma, the extent
of atrophy should be more dramatic in survivors of older disasters
than of recent ones. Freeman and his colleagues are comparing brain
scans of PTSD victims from the Gulf War, Vietnam and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Although the recent hippocampal research has little to say about
everyday stress and recovered memory, it does have some valuable
practical lessons for us.
</P>
<P>
   If a small hippocampus is indeed a risk factor for PTSD,
neuroanatomy should be taken into account when we decide whom to
ship off to battle. And if the atrophy is a consequence of the
trauma or the post-trauma period, scientists need to figure out how
the process works so we can learn how to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; SIDEBAR: MEMORY, HORMONES AND EVERYDAY WORRIES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of us will be spared post-traumatic stress disorder.
Instead our memory troubles will fall under the influence of
everyday stressors.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters confusing, stress also can help memory. We
remember where we were when the challenger exploded; we can recall
the details of an encounter with a mugger as if it were yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet we've also experienced ways in which stress can disrupt
memory _ such as discovering that the stress of an all-nighter does
some bad things to memory retrieval during a final exam the next
morning.
</P>
<P>
   We can reconcile this contradiction by appreciating the
difference between getting stressed like a normal mammal and
getting stressed like a human (over the course of, say, a 30-year
mortgage). In the former situation, the stress response is highly
adaptive, helping to save your life, while in the latter, the
unrelenting nature of the stress response sets you up for disease.
</P>
<P>
   That difference helps explain the data on stress and memory.
Stressors that last less than a few hours tend to sharpen memory,
mostly as a result of adrenaline. If the stressor persists, the
enhancement disappears, replaced by forgetfulness, mostly because
of glucocorticoids.

problems with memory and concentration. Those last two symptoms
have prompted recent brain-imaging studies.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, some neuroscientists have begun
generating magnetic resonance images of PTSD patients' brains and
carefully measuring the volumes of the organs' many bewildering
regions.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, groups working independently reported that in
afflicted individuals an important region of the brain called the
hippocampus is smaller than average.
</P>
<P>
   The hippocampus is used to form long-term memories, retrieve old
ones and manage explicit, conscious memory. Surgically destroy the
hippocampus, as has been done in a zillion lab rats and some major
types of memory will be gone for good. Similar problems result when
Alzheimer's disease ravages the hippocampus.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recent PTSD imaging studies have found atrophy only
in the hippocampus; the rest of the brain is fine. The damage,
however, is not trivial. Researchers at the Manchester VA Medical
Center and Harvard Medical School who have studied combat PTSD
patients reported that one side of the hippocampus was about 25
percent smaller than expected.
</P>
<P>
   While neuroscientists agree that an atrophied hippocampus and
PTSD go together, there is a lot of debate over why. One possible
explanation involves a class of steroid hormones called
glucocorticoids.
</P>
<P>
   During stress, whether of a physical or a psychological nature,
a person's adrenal glands secrete loads of these chemicals. But too
much of the hormones _ during chronic psychological stress, for
example _ can be a trigger for all sorts of stress-related
conditions, including high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Because the hippocampus has lots of receptors for
glucocorticoids, it's the part of the brain most sensitive to the
hormones. Glucocorticoids can damage neurons in the hippocampi of
rodents and primates. Can excessive glucocorticoids damage the
human hippocampus? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Cushing's disease, in which tumors produce
astronomically high glucocorticoid levels. Researchers have found
atrophied hippocampi on MRI scans of people with this disease. The
rest of the brain is fine, but the higher the levels of
glucocorticoids in the bloodstream, the smaller the hippocampus and
the more memory problems the patient experiences.
</P>
<P>
   When the tumor is corrected and glucocorticoid levels go back to
normal, the hippocampus slowly returns to normal size, suggesting
that the shriveling was reversible and the branches grew back.
</P>
<P>
   Is this what happens in PTSD? No one really has a clue;
researchers need to study actual brain tissue to determine whether
PTSD patients really have fewer neurons in their hippocampi than
healthy individuals. Moreover, no one knows how high glucocorticoid
levels get during a rape or a bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the Bronx
Veteran Affairs Medical Center in N.Y. have examined PTSD patients'
glucocorticoid levels and have observed that levels are not higher
than normal, but lower. They explain the syndrome not by excessive
stress hormones during trauma but by excessive sensitivity to these
hormones after the trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the idea that trauma could cause a brain to shrink
could be completely wrong. Maybe we have the story backward. Maybe
the person with a small hippocampus who goes into a trauma is the
one vulnerable to PTSD. Some researchers are trying to figure out
whether a small hippocampus predisposes someone to PTSD.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Thomas Freeman, a psychiatrist at the North Little
Rock Veterans Administration Medical Center, is taking another
approach. If the hippocampus shrinks after the trauma, the extent
of atrophy should be more dramatic in survivors of older disasters
than of recent ones. Freeman and his colleagues are comparing brain
scans of PTSD victims from the Gulf War, Vietnam and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Although the recent hippocampal research has little to say about
everyday stress and recovered memory, it does have some valuable
practical lessons for us.
</P>
<P>
   If a small hippocampus is indeed a risk factor for PTSD,
neuroanatomy should be taken into account when we decide whom to
ship off to battle. And if the atrophy is a consequence of the
trauma or the post-trauma period, scientists need to figure out how
the process works so we can learn how to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; SIDEBAR: MEMORY, HORMONES AND EVERYDAY WORRIES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of us will be spared post-traumatic stress disorder.
Instead our memory troubles will fall under the influence of
everyday stressors.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters confusing, stress also can help memory. We
remember where we were when the challenger exploded; we can recall
the details of an encounter with a mugger as if it were yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet we've also experienced ways in which stress can disrupt
memory _ such as discovering that the stress of an all-nighter does
some bad things to memory retrieval during a final exam the next
morning.
</P>
<P>
   We can reconcile this contradiction by appreciating the
difference between getting stressed like a normal mammal and
getting stressed like a human (over the course of, say, a 30-year
mortgage). In the former situation, the stress response is highly
adaptive, helping to save your life, while in the latter, the
unrelenting nature of the stress response sets you up for disease.
</P>
<P>
   That difference helps explain the data on stress and memory.
Stressors that last less than a few hours tend to sharpen memory,
mostly as a result of adrenaline. If the stressor persists, the
enhancement disappears, replaced by forgetfulness, mostly because
of glucocorticoids.

   There is nothing quite like a congested highway to make your
fellow human beings seem dispensable. You don't even have to be
stopped dead _ it's enough just to drive into one accordion after
another, breathing exhaust, eyeing the other lanes to see if you
should dart into them because they're moving just a bit faster.
</P>
<P>
   Worse is passing an onramp, grinding your teeth as a fresh
stream of enemies flows onto your road. Perhaps you accelerate a
bit to avoid giving way.
</P>
<P>
   Bernardo Huberman understands, but he might call you uninformed.
A little more traffic, he says, might be all it would take to
transform the whole mess into a state of crystalline harmony, one
that moves everyone to his destination reliably, steadily, and
safely.
</P>
<P>
   Huberman is a theoretical physicist at the Xerox Palo Alto
Research Center who, until recently, spent most of his working
hours pondering congestion on the Internet. But one day he got a
visit from Dirk Helbing of the University of Stuttgart in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Helbing is a theoretical physicist who spends all his working
hours pondering congestion on highways. Working together, Helbing
and Hubemman say they have found a way to unclog highways
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Their discovery is based on computer models, which have gotten a
lot better at capturing the intricacies of traffic. The newer ideas
that Helbing and other physicists have developed simplify matters.
</P>
<P>
   One method treats cars on a highway as molecules in a gas, but
molecules that want to move in one direction at a certain velocity.
The computer thus must solve fewer equations to describe the cars'
aggregate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Another method considers the cars individually, but as
``cellular automatons'' that follow simple rules _ ``I am going too
slow; there is a vacant cell in the adjacent lane that would allow
me to pass therefore, I shall pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The data that anchor these models to real conditions come from
those electric highway cables that cars must sometimes thump over.
They're called induction-loop detectors, and they measure the
number, size and speed of passing vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, studying the data from a set of detectors
on a stretch of highway north of Frankfurt, another Stuttgart
physicist, Boris Kerner of the DaimlerBenz Research Institute, made
a surprising discovery. Between free-flowing traffic and traffic
jams, he identified another pattern, slower than free-flowing but
still steady, in which cars in all three lanes moved at the same
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Kerner observed that this ``synchronized traffic'' occurred most
often near on-ramps. A peak in the number of cars coming off the
ramp could cause the traffic on the highway to synchronize
suddenly, like water vapor condensing to a droplet around a
particle of dust.
</P>
<P>
   The effect often spread up and down the highway from the ramp
and could persist for hours after the burst on the ramp had
subsided.
</P>
<P>
   By modeling traffic as a gas, Helbing has been able to reproduce
Kemer's synchronized traffic pattern _ and to show that it can be
caused by other disturbances, like one truck creeping past another,
slowing the flow behind. The synchronizing can even be caused by a
small trough in the number of cars merging onto a highway.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he has shown that there are many distinct phases of
congested traffic _ at least five _ between free-flowing and a jam.
Helbing has constructed a phase diagram for highway traffic which
suggests how different combinations of flow on the highway and flow
on a ramp can produce different types of congestion _ and how
easily one phase can flip into another.
</P>
<P>
   ``At certain traffic densities, small causes have large
effects,'' Helbing says. ``In particular, most types of congestion
are avoidable _ they ... are caused by small disturbances that grow
and at some point cause the traffic to break down.''
</P>
<P>
   Using Helbing's cellular automaton model, they simulated a
realistic mix of cars and trucks on a highway, moving at different
speeds and passing one another at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   They computed the times it took the vehicles to cover six miles
of road under a wide range of traffic conditions. At one critical
traffic density_ about 35 vehicles per mile of highway _ they
observed something _ ``All of them start becoming one,'' says
Huberman. ``Suddenly the traffic is basically moving like a solid
block.''
</P>
<P>
   At the critical density, the cars and trucks adopt the same
speed, and both types of vehicle seem to maintain that speed for a
long stretch of road. That is a desirable situation, say Helbing
and Huberman: A steady speed makes for reliable travel times and
less passing, which can cause accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The solidblock state is fragile, however; increase the vehicle
density a bit and the fast-moving block dissolves into sluggish and
aggravating stop-and-go traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are ways of keeping the block intact. All you
have to do, say Helbing and Huberman, is put computer-controlled
stoplights at each on-ramp. The lights would respond to real-time
data on traffic conditions collected by wires the cars pass over.
</P>
<P>
   When the data indicate gaps in a block of traffic passing an
on-ramp, the light there turns green. When the density threatens to
shift the traffic into stop-and-go, the light turns red again.
</P>
<P>
   At rush-hour peaks, traffic would still slow to a crawl. But at
intermediate densities, Huberman says, commuters would move
smoothly and contentedly as a solid block.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people act in selfish ways, it's very hard to achieve a
common goal,'' he says. ``But here the interesting thing is you
have a rather large group of people, they're all being selfish, and
yet they all achieve a very smooth state of running through the
freeway. It's an unintended, global cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nirvana on the freeway?
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly. For a little while.''

<P>
   Every now and then, someone with a medical problem needs a CT
scan or MRI of the brain. With luck, the test rules out a
threatening disease and in the resultant relief, the doctor shows
the patient the scan.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike pictures of other organs, which inspire a bemused
response, brain scans provoke awe. Rookie med students feel the
same disquiet in anatomy class when they first hold a cadaver's
brain in their hands. The brain, after all, is the Seat of the
Soul. From this mass of tissue resembling marinated tofu emanates a
person.
</P>
<P>
   By the time a child's body stops growing, the brain has long
since settled into its adult size. Which is why it's mighty
interesting when the size of some part of the brain changes
dramatically in an adult. Lately, a certain brain region has
attracted a lot of attention because it may atrophy in response to
a certain type of serious stress.
</P>
<P>
   Take a green 18-year-old, stick him in a uniform, ship him off
to a war and expose him to something truly horrific _ say, a battle
in which he's the only soldier in his entire unit to survive. Some
rare, inexplicable supermen may come out of such an experience
unfazed or even strengthened. But the average guy may suffer from
nightmares and feel estranged from loved ones. Some survivors
remain damaged for decades.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon was called shell shock during the First World
War, battle fatigue in World War II and in modern psychiatric
parlance, is called post-traumatic stress disorder.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just restricted to combat trauma, either. Gang rape,
childhood sexual abuse and imprisonment in Auschwitz are all
experiences that have produced the broken person labeled with the
acronym PTSD.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Psychiatric Association, patients with
PTSD suffer from flashbacks, nightmares, emotional numbness or
outbursts, loss of pleasure, an inappropriate startle reflex and
problems with memory and concentration. Those last two symptoms
have prompted recent brain-imaging studies.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, some neuroscientists have begun
generating magnetic resonance images of PTSD patients' brains and
carefully measuring the volumes of the organs' many bewildering
regions.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, groups working independently reported that in
afflicted individuals an important region of the brain called the
hippocampus is smaller than average.
</P>
<P>
   The hippocampus is used to form long-term memories, retrieve old
ones and manage explicit, conscious memory. Surgically destroy the
hippocampus, as has been done in a zillion lab rats and some major
types of memory will be gone for good. Similar problems result when
Alzheimer's disease ravages the hippocampus.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recent PTSD imaging studies have found atrophy only
in the hippocampus; the rest of the brain is fine. The damage,
however, is not trivial. Researchers at the Manchester VA Medical
Center and Harvard Medical School who have studied combat PTSD
patients reported that one side of the hippocampus was about 25
percent smaller than expected.
</P>
<P>
   While neuroscientists agree that an atrophied hippocampus and
PTSD go together, there is a lot of debate over why. One possible
explanation involves a class of steroid hormones called
glucocorticoids.
</P>
<P>
   During stress, whether of a physical or a psychological nature,
a person's adrenal glands secrete loads of these chemicals. But too
much of the hormones _ during chronic psychological stress, for
example _ can be a trigger for all sorts of stress-related
conditions, including high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Because the hippocampus has lots of receptors for
glucocorticoids, it's the part of the brain most sensitive to the
hormones. Glucocorticoids can damage neurons in the hippocampi of
rodents and primates. Can excessive glucocorticoids damage the
human hippocampus? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Cushing's disease, in which tumors produce
astronomically high glucocorticoid levels. Researchers have found
atrophied hippocampi on MRI scans of people with this disease. The
rest of the brain is fine, but the higher the levels of
glucocorticoids in the bloodstream, the smaller the hippocampus and
the more memory problems the patient experiences.
</P>
<P>
   When the tumor is corrected and glucocorticoid levels go back to
normal, the hippocampus slowly returns to normal size, suggesting
that the shriveling was reversible and the branches grew back.
</P>
<P>
   Is this what happens in PTSD? No one really has a clue;
researchers need to study actual brain tissue to determine whether
PTSD patients really have fewer neurons in their hippocampi than
healthy individuals. Moreover, no one knows how high glucocorticoid
levels get during a rape or a bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the Bronx
Veteran Affairs Medical Center in N.Y. have examined PTSD patients'
glucocorticoid levels and have observed that levels are not higher
than normal, but lower. They explain the syndrome not by excessive
stress hormones during trauma but by excessive sensitivity to these
hormones after the trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the idea that trauma could cause a brain to shrink
could be completely wrong. Maybe we have the story backward. Maybe
the person with a small hippocampus who goes into a trauma is the
one vulnerable to PTSD. Some researchers are trying to figure out
whether a small hippocampus predisposes someone to PTSD.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Thomas Freeman, a psychiatrist at the North Little
Rock Veterans Administration Medical Center, is taking another
approach. If the hippocampus shrinks after the trauma, the extent
of atrophy should be more dramatic in survivors of older disasters
than of recent ones. Freeman and his colleagues are comparing brain

   Although the recent hippocampal research has little to say about
everyday stress and recovered memory, it does have some valuable

<P>
   If a small hippocampus is indeed a risk factor for PTSD,
neuroanatomy should be taken into account when we decide whom to
ship off to battle. And if the atrophy is a consequence of the
trauma or the post-trauma period, scientists need to figure out how
the process works so we can learn how to prevent it.

<P>
   Most of us will be spared post-traumatic stress disorder.
Instead our memory troubles will fall under the influence of
everyday stressors.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters confusing, stress also can help memory. We
remember where we were when the challenger exploded; we can recall
the details of an encounter with a mugger as if it were yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet we've also experienced ways in which stress can disrupt
memory _ such as discovering that the stress of an all-nighter does

</P>
<P>
   We can reconcile this contradiction by appreciating the
difference between getting stressed like a normal mammal and
getting stressed like a human (over the course of, say, a 30-year
mortgage). In the former situation, the stress response is highly
adaptive, helping to save your life, while in the latter, the
unrelenting nature of the stress response sets you up for disease.
</P>
<P>
   That difference helps explain the data on stress and memory.
Stressors that last less than a few hours tend to sharpen memory,
mostly as a result of adrenaline. If the stressor persists, the
enhancement disappears, replaced by forgetfulness, mostly because
of glucocorticoids.

<P>
   Every now and then, someone with a medical problem needs a CT
scan or MRI of the brain. With luck, the test rules out a
threatening disease and in the resultant relief, the doctor shows
the patient the scan.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike pictures of other organs, which inspire a bemused
response, brain scans provoke awe. Rookie med students feel the
same disquiet in anatomy class when they first hold a cadaver's
brain in their hands. The brain, after all, is the Seat of the
Soul. From this mass of tissue resembling marinated tofu emanates a
person.
</P>
<P>
   By the time a child's body stops growing, the brain has long
since settled into its adult size. Which is why it's mighty
interesting when the size of some part of the brain changes
dramatically in an adult. Lately, a certain brain region has
attracted a lot of attention because it may atrophy in response to
a certain type of serious stress.
</P>
<P>
   Take a green 18-year-old, stick him in a uniform, ship him off
to a war and expose him to something truly horrific _ say, a battle
in which he's the only soldier in his entire unit to survive. Some
rare, inexplicable supermen may come out of such an experience
unfazed or even strengthened. But the average guy may suffer from
nightmares and feel estranged from loved ones. Some survivors
remain damaged for decades.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon was called shell shock during the First World
War, battle fatigue in World War II and in modern psychiatric
parlance, is called post-traumatic stress disorder.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just restricted to combat trauma, either. Gang rape,
childhood sexual abuse and imprisonment in Auschwitz are all
experiences that have produced the broken person labeled with the
acronym PTSD.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Psychiatric Association, patients with
PTSD suffer from flashbacks, nightmares, emotional numbness or
outbursts, loss of pleasure, an inappropriate startle reflex and
problems with memory and concentration. Those last two symptoms
have prompted recent brain-imaging studies.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, some neuroscientists have begun
generating magnetic resonance images of PTSD patients' brains and
carefully measuring the volumes of the organs' many bewildering
regions.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, groups working independently reported that in
afflicted individuals an important region of the brain called the
hippocampus is smaller than average.
</P>
<P>
   The hippocampus is used to form long-term memories, retrieve old
ones and manage explicit, conscious memory. Surgically destroy the
hippocampus, as has been done in a zillion lab rats and some major
types of memory will be gone for good. Similar problems result when
Alzheimer's disease ravages the hippocampus.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recent PTSD imaging studies have found atrophy only
in the hippocampus; the rest of the brain is fine. The damage,
however, is not trivial. Researchers at the Manchester VA Medical
Center and Harvard Medical School who have studied combat PTSD
patients reported that one side of the hippocampus was about 25
percent smaller than expected.
</P>
<P>
   While neuroscientists agree that an atrophied hippocampus and
PTSD go together, there is a lot of debate over why. One possible
explanation involves a class of steroid hormones called
glucocorticoids.
</P>
<P>
   During stress, whether of a physical or a psychological nature,
a person's adrenal glands secrete loads of these chemicals. But too
much of the hormones _ during chronic psychological stress, for
example _ can be a trigger for all sorts of stress-related
conditions, including high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Because the hippocampus has lots of receptors for
glucocorticoids, it's the part of the brain most sensitive to the
hormones. Glucocorticoids can damage neurons in the hippocampi of
rodents and primates. Can excessive glucocorticoids damage the
human hippocampus? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Cushing's disease, in which tumors produce
astronomically high glucocorticoid levels. Researchers have found
atrophied hippocampi on MRI scans of people with this disease. The
rest of the brain is fine, but the higher the levels of
glucocorticoids in the bloodstream, the smaller the hippocampus and
the more memory problems the patient experiences.
</P>
<P>
   When the tumor is corrected and glucocorticoid levels go back to
normal, the hippocampus slowly returns to normal size, suggesting
that the shriveling was reversible and the branches grew back.
</P>
<P>
   Is this what happens in PTSD? No one really has a clue;
researchers need to study actual brain tissue to determine whether
PTSD patients really have fewer neurons in their hippocampi than
healthy individuals. Moreover, no one knows how high glucocorticoid
levels get during a rape or a bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the Bronx
Veteran Affairs Medical Center in N.Y. have examined PTSD patients'
glucocorticoid levels and have observed that levels are not higher
than normal, but lower. They explain the syndrome not by excessive
stress hormones during trauma but by excessive sensitivity to these
hormones after the trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the idea that trauma could cause a brain to shrink
could be completely wrong. Maybe we have the story backward. Maybe
the person with a small hippocampus who goes into a trauma is the
one vulnerable to PTSD. Some researchers are trying to figure out
whether a small hippocampus predisposes someone to PTSD.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Thomas Freeman, a psychiatrist at the North Little
Rock Veterans Administration Medical Center, is taking another
approach. If the hippocampus shrinks after the trauma, the extent
of atrophy should be more dramatic in survivors of older disasters
than of recent ones. Freeman and his colleagues are comparing brain
scans of PTSD victims from the Gulf War, Vietnam and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Although the recent hippocampal research has little to say about
everyday stress and recovered memory, it does have some valuable
practical lessons for us.
</P>
<P>
   If a small hippocampus is indeed a risk factor for PTSD,
neuroanatomy should be taken into account when we decide whom to
ship off to battle. And if the atrophy is a consequence of the
trauma or the post-trauma period, scientists need to figure out how

   There is nothing quite like a congested highway to make your
fellow human beings seem dispensable. You don't even have to be
stopped dead _ it's enough just to drive into one accordion after
another, breathing exhaust, eyeing the other lanes to see if you
should dart into them because they're moving just a bit faster.
</P>
<P>
   Worse is passing an onramp, grinding your teeth as a fresh
stream of enemies flows onto your road. Perhaps you accelerate a
bit to avoid giving way.
</P>
<P>
   Bernardo Huberman understands, but he might call you uninformed.
A little more traffic, he says, might be all it would take to
transform the whole mess into a state of crystalline harmony, one
that moves everyone to his destination reliably, steadily, and
safely.
</P>
<P>
   Huberman is a theoretical physicist at the Xerox Palo Alto
Research Center who, until recently, spent most of his working
hours pondering congestion on the Internet. But one day he got a
visit from Dirk Helbing of the University of Stuttgart in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Helbing is a theoretical physicist who spends all his working
hours pondering congestion on highways. Working together, Helbing
and Hubemman say they have found a way to unclog highways
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Their discovery is based on computer models, which have gotten a
lot better at capturing the intricacies of traffic. The newer ideas
that Helbing and other physicists have developed simplify matters.
</P>
<P>
   One method treats cars on a highway as molecules in a gas, but
molecules that want to move in one direction at a certain velocity.
The computer thus must solve fewer equations to describe the cars'
aggregate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Another method considers the cars individually, but as
``cellular automatons'' that follow simple rules _ ``I am going too
slow; there is a vacant cell in the adjacent lane that would allow
me to pass therefore, I shall pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The data that anchor these models to real conditions come from
those electric highway cables that cars must sometimes thump over.
They're called induction-loop detectors, and they measure the
number, size and speed of passing vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, studying the data from a set of detectors
on a stretch of highway north of Frankfurt, another Stuttgart
physicist, Boris Kerner of the DaimlerBenz Research Institute, made
a surprising discovery. Between free-flowing traffic and traffic
jams, he identified another pattern, slower than free-flowing but
still steady, in which cars in all three lanes moved at the same
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Kerner observed that this ``synchronized traffic'' occurred most
often near on-ramps. A peak in the number of cars coming off the
ramp could cause the traffic on the highway to synchronize
suddenly, like water vapor condensing to a droplet around a
particle of dust.
</P>
<P>
   The effect often spread up and down the highway from the ramp
and could persist for hours after the burst on the ramp had
subsided.
</P>
<P>
   By modeling traffic as a gas, Helbing has been able to reproduce
Kemer's synchronized traffic pattern _ and to show that it can be
caused by other disturbances, like one truck creeping past another,
slowing the flow behind. The synchronizing can even be caused by a
small trough in the number of cars merging onto a highway.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he has shown that there are many distinct phases of
congested traffic _ at least five _ between free-flowing and a jam.
Helbing has constructed a phase diagram for highway traffic which
suggests how different combinations of flow on the highway and flow
on a ramp can produce different types of congestion _ and how
easily one phase can flip into another.
</P>
<P>
   ``At certain traffic densities, small causes have large
effects,'' Helbing says. ``In particular, most types of congestion
are avoidable _ they ... are caused by small disturbances that grow
and at some point cause the traffic to break down.''
</P>
<P>
   Using Helbing's cellular automaton model, they simulated a
realistic mix of cars and trucks on a highway, moving at different
speeds and passing one another at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   They computed the times it took the vehicles to cover six miles
of road under a wide range of traffic conditions. At one critical
traffic density_ about 35 vehicles per mile of highway _ they
observed something _ ``All of them start becoming one,'' says
Huberman. ``Suddenly the traffic is basically moving like a solid
block.''
</P>
<P>
   At the critical density, the cars and trucks adopt the same
speed, and both types of vehicle seem to maintain that speed for a
long stretch of road. That is a desirable situation, say Helbing
and Huberman: A steady speed makes for reliable travel times and
less passing, which can cause accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The solidblock state is fragile, however; increase the vehicle
density a bit and the fast-moving block dissolves into sluggish and
aggravating stop-and-go traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are ways of keeping the block intact. All you
have to do, say Helbing and Huberman, is put computer-controlled
stoplights at each on-ramp. The lights would respond to real-time
data on traffic conditions collected by wires the cars pass over.
</P>
<P>
   When the data indicate gaps in a block of traffic passing an
on-ramp, the light there turns green. When the density threatens to
shift the traffic into stop-and-go, the light turns red again.
</P>
<P>
   At rush-hour peaks, traffic would still slow to a crawl. But at
intermediate densities, Huberman says, commuters would move
smoothly and contentedly as a solid block.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people act in selfish ways, it's very hard to achieve a
common goal,'' he says. ``But here the interesting thing is you
have a rather large group of people, they're all being selfish, and
yet they all achieve a very smooth state of running through the
freeway. It's an unintended, global cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nirvana on the freeway?
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly. For a little while.''

<P>
   Every now and then, someone with a medical problem needs a CT
scan or MRI of the brain. With luck, the test rules out a
threatening disease and in the resultant relief, the doctor shows
the patient the scan.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike pictures of other organs, which inspire a bemused
response, brain scans provoke awe. Rookie med students feel the
same disquiet in anatomy class when they first hold a cadaver's
brain in their hands. The brain, after all, is the Seat of the
Soul. From this mass of tissue resembling marinated tofu emanates a
person.
</P>
<P>
   By the time a child's body stops growing, the brain has long
since settled into its adult size. Which is why it's mighty
interesting when the size of some part of the brain changes
dramatically in an adult. Lately, a certain brain region has
attracted a lot of attention because it may atrophy in response to
a certain type of serious stress.
</P>
<P>
   Take a green 18-year-old, stick him in a uniform, ship him off
to a war and expose him to something truly horrific _ say, a battle
in which he's the only soldier in his entire unit to survive. Some
rare, inexplicable supermen may come out of such an experience
unfazed or even strengthened. But the average guy may suffer from
nightmares and feel estranged from loved ones. Some survivors
remain damaged for decades.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon was called shell shock during the First World
War, battle fatigue in World War II and in modern psychiatric
parlance, is called post-traumatic stress disorder.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just restricted to combat trauma, either. Gang rape,
childhood sexual abuse and imprisonment in Auschwitz are all
experiences that have produced the broken person labeled with the
acronym PTSD.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Psychiatric Association, patients with
PTSD suffer from flashbacks, nightmares, emotional numbness or
outbursts, loss of pleasure, an inappropriate startle reflex and
problems with memory and concentration. Those last two symptoms
have prompted recent brain-imaging studies.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, some neuroscientists have begun
generating magnetic resonance images of PTSD patients' brains and
carefully measuring the volumes of the organs' many bewildering
regions.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, groups working independently reported that in
afflicted individuals an important region of the brain called the
hippocampus is smaller than average.
</P>
<P>
   The hippocampus is used to form long-term memories, retrieve old
ones and manage explicit, conscious memory. Surgically destroy the
hippocampus, as has been done in a zillion lab rats and some major
types of memory will be gone for good. Similar problems result when
Alzheimer's disease ravages the hippocampus.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recent PTSD imaging studies have found atrophy only
in the hippocampus; the rest of the brain is fine. The damage,
however, is not trivial. Researchers at the Manchester VA Medical
Center and Harvard Medical School who have studied combat PTSD
patients reported that one side of the hippocampus was about 25
percent smaller than expected.
</P>
<P>
   While neuroscientists agree that an atrophied hippocampus and
PTSD go together, there is a lot of debate over why. One possible
explanation involves a class of steroid hormones called
glucocorticoids.
</P>
<P>
   During stress, whether of a physical or a psychological nature,
a person's adrenal glands secrete loads of these chemicals. But too
much of the hormones _ during chronic psychological stress, for
example _ can be a trigger for all sorts of stress-related
conditions, including high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Because the hippocampus has lots of receptors for
glucocorticoids, it's the part of the brain most sensitive to the
hormones. Glucocorticoids can damage neurons in the hippocampi of
rodents and primates. Can excessive glucocorticoids damage the
human hippocampus? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Cushing's disease, in which tumors produce
astronomically high glucocorticoid levels. Researchers have found
atrophied hippocampi on MRI scans of people with this disease. The
rest of the brain is fine, but the higher the levels of
glucocorticoids in the bloodstream, the smaller the hippocampus and
the more memory problems the patient experiences.
</P>
<P>
   When the tumor is corrected and glucocorticoid levels go back to
normal, the hippocampus slowly returns to normal size, suggesting
that the shriveling was reversible and the branches grew back.
</P>
<P>
   Is this what happens in PTSD? No one really has a clue;
researchers need to study actual brain tissue to determine whether
PTSD patients really have fewer neurons in their hippocampi than
healthy individuals. Moreover, no one knows how high glucocorticoid
levels get during a rape or a bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the Bronx
Veteran Affairs Medical Center in N.Y. have examined PTSD patients'
glucocorticoid levels and have observed that levels are not higher
than normal, but lower. They explain the syndrome not by excessive
stress hormones during trauma but by excessive sensitivity to these
hormones after the trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the idea that trauma could cause a brain to shrink
could be completely wrong. Maybe we have the story backward. Maybe
the person with a small hippocampus who goes into a trauma is the
one vulnerable to PTSD. Some researchers are trying to figure out
whether a small hippocampus predisposes someone to PTSD.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Thomas Freeman, a psychiatrist at the North Little
Rock Veterans Administration Medical Center, is taking another
approach. If the hippocampus shrinks after the trauma, the extent
of atrophy should be more dramatic in survivors of older disasters
than of recent ones. Freeman and his colleagues are comparing brain
scans of PTSD victims from the Gulf War, Vietnam and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Although the recent hippocampal research has little to say about
everyday stress and recovered memory, it does have some valuable
practical lessons for us.
</P>
<P>
   If a small hippocampus is indeed a risk factor for PTSD,
neuroanatomy should be taken into account when we decide whom to
ship off to battle. And if the atrophy is a consequence of the
trauma or the post-trauma period, scientists need to figure out how
the process works so we can learn how to prevent it.
</P>
<P>

 &UR; SIDEBAR: MEMORY, HORMONES AND EVERYDAY WORRIES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of us will be spared post-traumatic stress disorder.
Instead our memory troubles will fall under the influence of
everyday stressors.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters confusing, stress also can help memory. We
remember where we were when the challenger exploded; we can recall
the details of an encounter with a mugger as if it were yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet we've also experienced ways in which stress can disrupt
memory _ such as discovering that the stress of an all-nighter does
some bad things to memory retrieval during a final exam the next
morning.
</P>
<P>
   We can reconcile this contradiction by appreciating the
difference between getting stressed like a normal mammal and
getting stressed like a human (over the course of, say, a 30-year
mortgage). In the former situation, the stress response is highly
adaptive, helping to save your life, while in the latter, the
unrelenting nature of the stress response sets you up for disease.
</P>
<P>
   That difference helps explain the data on stress and memory.
Stressors that last less than a few hours tend to sharpen memory,
mostly as a result of adrenaline. If the stressor persists, the
enhancement disappears, replaced by forgetfulness, mostly because
of glucocorticoids.

<P>
   There is nothing quite like a congested highway to make your
fellow human beings seem dispensable. You don't even have to be
stopped dead _ it's enough just to drive into one accordion after
another, breathing exhaust, eyeing the other lanes to see if you
should dart into them because they're moving just a bit faster.
</P>
<P>
   Worse is passing an onramp, grinding your teeth as a fresh
stream of enemies flows onto your road. Perhaps you accelerate a
bit to avoid giving way.
</P>
<P>
   Bernardo Huberman understands, but he might call you uninformed.
A little more traffic, he says, might be all it would take to
transform the whole mess into a state of crystalline harmony, one
that moves everyone to his destination reliably, steadily, and
safely.
</P>
<P>
   Huberman is a theoretical physicist at the Xerox Palo Alto
Research Center who, until recently, spent most of his working
hours pondering congestion on the Internet. But one day he got a
visit from Dirk Helbing of the University of Stuttgart in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Helbing is a theoretical physicist who spends all his working
hours pondering congestion on highways. Working together, Helbing
and Hubemman say they have found a way to unclog highways
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Their discovery is based on computer models, which have gotten a
lot better at capturing the intricacies of traffic. The newer ideas
that Helbing and other physicists have developed simplify matters.
</P>
<P>
   One method treats cars on a highway as molecules in a gas, but
molecules that want to move in one direction at a certain velocity.
The computer thus must solve fewer equations to describe the cars'
aggregate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Another method considers the cars individually, but as
``cellular automatons'' that follow simple rules _ ``I am going too
slow; there is a vacant cell in the adjacent lane that would allow
me to pass therefore, I shall pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The data that anchor these models to real conditions come from
those electric highway cables that cars must sometimes thump over.
They're called induction-loop detectors, and they measure the
number, size and speed of passing vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, studying the data from a set of detectors
on a stretch of highway north of Frankfurt, another Stuttgart
physicist, Boris Kerner of the DaimlerBenz Research Institute, made
a surprising discovery. Between free-flowing traffic and traffic
jams, he identified another pattern, slower than free-flowing but
still steady, in which cars in all three lanes moved at the same
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Kerner observed that this ``synchronized traffic'' occurred most
often near on-ramps. A peak in the number of cars coming off the
ramp could cause the traffic on the highway to synchronize
suddenly, like water vapor condensing to a droplet around a
particle of dust.
</P>
<P>
   The effect often spread up and down the highway from the ramp
and could persist for hours after the burst on the ramp had
subsided.
</P>
<P>
   By modeling traffic as a gas, Helbing has been able to reproduce
Kemer's synchronized traffic pattern _ and to show that it can be
caused by other disturbances, like one truck creeping past another,
slowing the flow behind. The synchronizing can even be caused by a
small trough in the number of cars merging onto a highway.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he has shown that there are many distinct phases of
congested traffic _ at least five _ between free-flowing and a jam.
Helbing has constructed a phase diagram for highway traffic which
suggests how different combinations of flow on the highway and flow
on a ramp can produce different types of congestion _ and how
easily one phase can flip into another.
</P>
<P>
   ``At certain traffic densities, small causes have large
effects,'' Helbing says. ``In particular, most types of congestion
are avoidable _ they ... are caused by small disturbances that grow
and at some point cause the traffic to break down.''
</P>
<P>
   Using Helbing's cellular automaton model, they simulated a
realistic mix of cars and trucks on a highway, moving at different
speeds and passing one another at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   They computed the times it took the vehicles to cover six miles
of road under a wide range of traffic conditions. At one critical
traffic density_ about 35 vehicles per mile of highway _ they
observed something _ ``All of them start becoming one,'' says
Huberman. ``Suddenly the traffic is basically moving like a solid
block.''
</P>
<P>
   At the critical density, the cars and trucks adopt the same
speed, and both types of vehicle seem to maintain that speed for a
long stretch of road. That is a desirable situation, say Helbing
and Huberman: A steady speed makes for reliable travel times and
less passing, which can cause accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The solidblock state is fragile, however; increase the vehicle
density a bit and the fast-moving block dissolves into sluggish and
aggravating stop-and-go traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are ways of keeping the block intact. All you
have to do, say Helbing and Huberman, is put computer-controlled
stoplights at each on-ramp. The lights would respond to real-time
data on traffic conditions collected by wires the cars pass over.
</P>
<P>
   When the data indicate gaps in a block of traffic passing an
on-ramp, the light there turns green. When the density threatens to
shift the traffic into stop-and-go, the light turns red again.
</P>
<P>
   At rush-hour peaks, traffic would still slow to a crawl. But at
intermediate densities, Huberman says, commuters would move
smoothly and contentedly as a solid block.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people act in selfish ways, it's very hard to achieve a
common goal,'' he says. ``But here the interesting thing is you
have a rather large group of people, they're all being selfish, and
yet they all achieve a very smooth state of running through the
freeway. It's an unintended, global cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nirvana on the freeway?
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly. For a little while.''

aggregate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Another method considers the cars individually, but as
``cellular automatons'' that follow simple rules _ ``I am going too
slow; there is a vacant cell in the adjacent lane that would allow
me to pass therefore, I shall pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The data that anchor these models to real conditions come from
those electric highway cables that cars must sometimes thump over.
They're called induction-loop detectors, and they measure the
number, size and speed of passing vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, studying the data from a set of detectors
on a stretch of highway north of Frankfurt, another Stuttgart
physicist, Boris Kerner of the DaimlerBenz Research Institute, made
a surprising discovery. Between free-flowing traffic and traffic
jams, he identified another pattern, slower than free-flowing but
still steady, in which cars in all three lanes moved at the same
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Kerner observed that this ``synchronized traffic'' occurred most
often near on-ramps. A peak in the number of cars coming off the
ramp could cause the traffic on the highway to synchronize
suddenly, like water vapor condensing to a droplet around a
particle of dust.
</P>
<P>
   The effect often spread up and down the highway from the ramp
and could persist for hours after the burst on the ramp had
subsided.
</P>
<P>
   By modeling traffic as a gas, Helbing has been able to reproduce
Kemer's synchronized traffic pattern _ and to show that it can be
caused by other disturbances, like one truck creeping past another,
slowing the flow behind. The synchronizing can even be caused by a
small trough in the number of cars merging onto a highway.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he has shown that there are many distinct phases of
congested traffic _ at least five _ between free-flowing and a jam.
Helbing has constructed a phase diagram for highway traffic which
suggests how different combinations of flow on the highway and flow
on a ramp can produce different types of congestion _ and how
easily one phase can flip into another.
</P>
<P>
   ``At certain traffic densities, small causes have large
effects,'' Helbing says. ``In particular, most types of congestion
are avoidable _ they ... are caused by small disturbances that grow
and at some point cause the traffic to break down.''
</P>
<P>
   Using Helbing's cellular automaton model, they simulated a
realistic mix of cars and trucks on a highway, moving at different
speeds and passing one another at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   They computed the times it took the vehicles to cover six miles
of road under a wide range of traffic conditions. At one critical
traffic density_ about 35 vehicles per mile of highway _ they
observed something _ ``All of them start becoming one,'' says
Huberman. ``Suddenly the traffic is basically moving like a solid
block.''
</P>
<P>
   At the critical density, the cars and trucks adopt the same
speed, and both types of vehicle seem to maintain that speed for a
long stretch of road. That is a desirable situation, say Helbing
and Huberman: A steady speed makes for reliable travel times and
less passing, which can cause accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The solidblock state is fragile, however; increase the vehicle
density a bit and the fast-moving block dissolves into sluggish and
aggravating stop-and-go traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are ways of keeping the block intact. All you
have to do, say Helbing and Huberman, is put computer-controlled
stoplights at each on-ramp. The lights would respond to real-time
data on traffic conditions collected by wires the cars pass over.
</P>
<P>
   When the data indicate gaps in a block of traffic passing an
on-ramp, the light there turns green. When the density threatens to
shift the traffic into stop-and-go, the light turns red again.
</P>
<P>
   At rush-hour peaks, traffic would still slow to a crawl. But at
intermediate densities, Huberman says, commuters would move
smoothly and contentedly as a solid block.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people act in selfish ways, it's very hard to achieve a
common goal,'' he says. ``But here the interesting thing is you
have a rather large group of people, they're all being selfish, and
yet they all achieve a very smooth state of running through the
freeway. It's an unintended, global cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nirvana on the freeway?
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly. For a little while.''

COMMENTARY: WHILE WE WERE SLEEPING 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By   THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ Visiting Shanghai is always a useful reminder of how
frozen perceptions of China are in America today, and how far
reality has moved here. To listen to some of the talk in Congress,
one would think that nothing has changed in China since Tiananmen
Square. To talk to Chinese is to understand that a ``New Deal'' has
been forged in the past decade between the Chinese Communist Party
and the Chinese people. It is a messy, cynical, pragmatic deal, but
it is the central political reality of China today, and it explains
why America is winning here, not losing.
</P>
<P>
   While Tiananmen marked the end of the student-led democracy
movement in China, it also marked the end of the Chinese Communist
dictatorship as we knew it. While China's leaders may have feigned
indifference to the outside world, it's clear now that they
realized that they almost lost it all in 1989, and that they needed
a new bargain with their people in order to survive.
</P>
<P>
   That new deal is as follows: We the Communist Party will remove
ourselves from people's lives as never before. You can work where
you want, live where you want, wear what you want, study abroad if
you want, get from the Internet most of what you want and start a
business if you want. In return, the Party will insist on only two
things _ that you dare not challenge its authority and that you
have only one child.
</P>
<P>
   This new deal, and the flourishing of personal freedoms it
delivered, helps explain some of the internal stability of the past
decade. In 1989, many Chinese who took to the streets at Tiananmen,
or passively supported it, came from homes with a bare light bulb
swinging from the ceiling, no TV, no phone, one Mao outfit and no
prospects to improve their lives. That is not the case today.
</P>
<P>
   I participated in a seminar at Shanghai's Fudan University, and
was particularly struck by one professor who said: ``We need a
country in the world, like America, that has a dream to be perfect.
And when America is telling China that it is violating basic human
rights, we should admit that we have human rights problems. But
today's China is better than yesterday's China. We have a way to
improve. We feel our lives are better today, and we are not
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The combination of rising incomes, rising opportunities and
greater personal freedom has enabled the Communist Party to rule
not only by repression, but with the passive assent of China's
silent majority. The party has bought itself some time.
</P>
<P>
   But how much?
</P>
<P>
   That will depend in part on the government's ability to keep
incomes and opportunities rising. If it stumbles it is going to
have to share power sooner. But it will also depend on a new factor
_ the information revolution that is sweeping China. At the
university and elite levels the Internet is now pervasive, and at
the mass level there has been an entertainment revolution in the
past two years, with the spread of cheap video compact-disk
players. Virtually every Hollywood film has been pirated here and
they are now being viewed everywhere in China. As a result, the gap
between the Communist Party and the rest of China is now growing
wider and wider. The party is frozen and the country is running
away from it.
</P>
<P>
   Graham Earnshaw, who runs a booming Shanghai business designing
Web pages, has been in China for more than 20 years. He remarked to
me: ``I was recently out visiting the Hope Group, which is a major
grain company and the largest private company in China. I was
meeting with the chairman and there were two other people sitting
there. I asked him about the company's relationship with the
Communist Party. He pointed to the two guys sitting there and said,
``They are both Communist Party members, and my aim is to make them
millionaires in two years.' ''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how the political transition is going to happen
here. But I do know that everything from American contract law to
accounting standards to cultural messages is now winning here more
each day. We should keep hammering China on human rights and
international norms. The Chinese leadership needs to hear that. But
what is driving change here is the educational, commercial,
entertainment and Internet interactions between millions of Chinese
and the outside world, and that must never be aborted.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, the Communist Party tried to privatize Russian
society and it failed. In China _ if we are lucky _ the Chinese
people will privatize the Communist Party.

A HIGH-COUNTRY INTERLUDE AND RECONNECTION 
</HEADLINE>

 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVON, Colo. _ The house is empty this morning, save for me and
the dog. And she's asleep. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My wife (who, in another life, used to teach skiing) and our
friends have headed over to nearby Vail to take a few runs down the
mountain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I don't ski. Except for going down a small hill a few times in
my great aunt's backyard in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1958, I've never
been on skis. I have other athletic vices. Besides, I figure if I
want to have my leg broken I know several people who'd be willing
to oblige _ and at considerably less than the cost of a ski-lift
ticket, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So what I am doing this morning is what, in my experience,
almost none of us does enough. I am being alone with myself with no
mandatory agenda. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I am giving myself this gift of time to become reacquainted with
myself, to listen to places in my soul that often get ignored
because my life is so busy, noisy, spoken for. This is no
complaint. I love my life. I have made choices _ most of them good.
And I am able, much of the time, to live a life reasonably well
centered on the eternal values that give it meaning and purpose. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But now and then I realize that the core of me has simply been
along for the ride for too long. I need to acknowledge my central
essence and try to listen to how it is doing and what it would tell
me. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So in this morning mountain chill, on a bright, azure day, I am
sitting on the deck of the house in which we're staying and am
trying simply to be, trying just to be mindful, as the Buddhists
say. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Across a crooked valley of homes the mountains are dappled with
snow and tiny skiers that I have to squint at to see moving. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mountains always humble me. They tell me I am dust and to dust I
will return. They tell me I am a small, dim flash on history's
radar screen, and yet even one so insignificant is given the
common-grace gift of mountains. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mountains tell me, too, of the human capacity for grandeur. On
the way up here last night, we drove through the Eisenhower tunnel,
a mile-plus, four-lane part of Interstate 70 lasered through the
belly of a mountain. I remarked then to my wife on the astonishing
engineering required to carry out so bold and seemingly reckless an
idea. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And isn't that the human condition? We are at once transient
renters on this planet _ ``aliens and strangers,'' I Peter 2:11
calls us in the New International Version of the Bible. And yet
while we are here we imagine and create electrifying things, from
mountain tunnels to skyscrapers, from poetry to sculpture, from
airplanes to space telescopes to, well, Y2K computer bugs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the evidence of ageless mountains and stars, somehow we
are convinced that a human life's normal span _ now 75 or 80 years
in this country _ is a long time, certainly enough to create
something lasting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After dinner last night I stepped out onto the deck to look at
the stunning night sky. In crystal air, more than a mile and a half
above sea level, the stars _ not hidden by the light pollution of
the metropolis in which I live _ took my breath away. This was, in
modern electronic culture terms, the high-definition television
version of a nightly show. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And I was reminded of a thought from a book I just read,
``Amazing Grace: A Vocabulary of Faith.'' Author Kathleen Norris
reminds us there that all the atoms that make up human beings once
were part of distant stars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This morning, alone, listening in silence, I'm grateful to be so
physically connected to the cosmos. I'm also glad to be reconnected
to the uniqueness of my being and to celebrate the truth that
although the soulless mountains and stars cannot think about me, I
can think about both them and me. And so I do. &QL;

30 DAYS TO TAE-BO MASTERY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
By THOMAS ROPP  
c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - I don't usually pay attention to infomercials, but
this one grabs me. Everyone is kung-fu fighting.
</P>
<P>
   With oneself.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's more like aerobics with bite, or rather, kick.
There's one lead instructor with a dozen or so backups behind him.
I'm especially riveted by the frenzy of kicking, punching and leg
lifts, all synched and choreographed to a driving, hypnotic
soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   The voiceover calls it Tae-Bo, the future of fitness. Featured
is a lean, charismatic man with soulful eyes who kicks and jabs
with machinelike precision. His name is Billy Blanks, seven-time
world martial arts champion and Tae-Bo's inventor. He, like the
workout, speaks directly to me.
</P>
<P>
   He's saying, ``That will be $69.95, please.''  &QL; 
Day 1
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, the four videotapes arrive. Considerably less
inspired since getting hooked on the infomercial, I'm feeling a
little foolish for spending so much money on something that may be
an out-and-out scam. In fact, I still don't understand what Tae-Bo
is exactly. Friends tell me it's a funky hybrid of kick boxing,
martial arts and aerobics.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes after the tapes arrive, I begin my own Tae-Bo
adventure. There are no written instructions, so I don't know what
tape to watch first, but I pop in the Instructional video, figuring
that makes more sense than the other three: Basic, Advanced and
8-Minute Workout.
</P>
<P>
   The running time of the Instructional tape is about 40 minutes.
It starts with a warmup and slides into how to execute various
types of punches, kicks and leg raises.
</P>
<P>
   I spend nearly 90 minutes, stopping and starting the video to
practice one move before going on to the next. I'm doing pretty
well until the roundhouse kick. Billy says to hold your leg out to
your side, level enough to balance a glass of water on it. Funny
guy. I'm looking at a whole lot of water in my sock.  &QL; 
Day 2
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Continue with learning the Instructional tape. It's like
learning the steps to a fast dance. I stop and start the tape,
learning each move before going to the next. I find myself breaking
out into these moves unexpectedly during the day. No one seems to
appreciate my new talents. I think I'm being observed. &QL; 
Day 3
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Begin Basic video.
</P>
<P>
   Am really glad I took the time to learn the moves in the
Instructional video. Footwork on jabs shaky, and roundhouse kicks
still pathetic, but I'm keeping up, even when the workout shifts
into double time.
</P>
<P>
   Some moves, such as punching at an invisible ``speed bag,'' are
not covered in the Instructional tape but are easy to learn. At
least they appear easy. Doing them correctly is another matter. To
get maximum benefit, the speed bag exercise requires keeping upper
and lower arm muscles taut. Stomach muscles are always taut. Blanks
isn't bashful about reminding to keep abs tight, ribs high.
Overall, he speaks softly, carries a big kick.
</P>
<P>
   The full Basic workout runs about 20 minutes, culminating in a
leg-burning set of double-time roundhouse kicks shifting between
left and right sides.
</P>
<P>
   I'm impressed. Sweating profusely, I feel better about my Tae-Bo
investment. It's a good, honest workout. I expected something
harder. I'm a runner, which probably helps my endurance at Tae-Bo.
But I think anyone who is in good health could complete this
workout.
</P>
<P>
   A tae-chi type cool-down follows the workout. Shifting from
frenzy to ballet, Billy leads me through a slow, mysterious
exercise that requires scooping up air and pushing it from side to
side. Strange as it seems, I can actually feel the energy move
around me.
</P>
<P>
   It's a calming sensation. I feel in balance. &QL; 
Day 4
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No longer in balance. Sore as hell. Especially the backs of the
legs, abs and shoulders. I guess this is a barometer of benefits.
But there's also a sharp pain in my neck that can't be good. Feels
like I've thrown something out of whack. I'm not sure how it
happened. I may have put myself in an awkward position while trying
to watch the tape and do the workout at the same time. &QL; 
Days 5-16
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Continue with the Basic workout. The pain in the neck has not
gone away. A trip to the chiropractor may not be far off.
</P>
<P>
   Another unexpected side effect has developed: I'm told that I've
become unusually punchy, a 5-year-old with a stick. It's true. I
suddenly have urges to kick and punch no matter where I am or what
I'm doing.
</P>
<P>
   People are standing back when they talk to me.
</P>
<P>
   A not-so-subtle friend suggests Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   While out running, I encounter two dogs approaching my flank
aggressively. Without breaking stride, I turn my head sharply and
tell the lead mutt, ``No!'' Surprised, he falls; the dog behind him
falls, too. My neck pain disappears. &QL; 
Day 17
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I try my hand (and foot) at the Advanced workout.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Madre de dios! (end ital) Now I understand the term
``hellbent.'' It's diabolical to bend a person's body like this for
so long. Billy does have a cruel side. The soft-spoken apostle of
fitness from the Basic workout has morphed into Godzilla in
leotards as he roars fiery commands and pushes his troops toward
Tae-Bo oblivion in the Advanced workout.
</P>
<P>
   This one is three times longer (60 minutes) but 10 times more
difficult. There are many new, intricate moves performed at
supersonic speeds.
</P>
<P>
   I can't keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through the tape, Billy delivers the coup de grace when
the workout drops to the floor for 20 minutes of grueling leg
extensions. Even his perfectly chiseled, fat-free backups do some
serious moaning during the stretch run of this workout.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost as hard to watch as it is to do. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Days 18-28
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pain of the Advanced workout grows on me.
</P>
<P>
   I can't believe what a sniveling wimp I was the first time I
tried the Advanced tape. However, the floor exercises are still a
bit much. I'm dividing the Advanced workout into two sessions: 30
minutes of the stand-up workout one day, followed by the 20-minute
down-on-the-floor exercises the next day.
</P>
<P>
   As God is my witness, someday I will complete the entire
Advanced workout as Billy intended. &QL; 
Day 29
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remembered I had another video. Popped in the 8-Minute Workout,
and eight minutes later, popped it back out.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't even work up a sweat. Come on, Billy, admit it, this
video is padding.
</P>
<P>
   Truncated Tae-Bo is like jumping rope with one hand. If I really
wanted a workout shortened that dramatically, I'd just do the Basic
20-minute workout for eight minutes and move on to my next meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Scale check. After four weeks of Tae-Boing, I have lost exactly
. . . 2 pounds?
</P>
<P>
   Good thing I didn't do this to lose weight. &QL; 
Day 30
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I thought I was making some real progress until a black-belt
friend of mine pointed out that my stationary foot was not pivoted
properly for side-kick action. My kicking technique was learned by
what I could see on the video, which obviously wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   My major criticism of the Tae-Bo tapes is that they could use
more detailed instruction, especially on footwork.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not stopping the tapes from selling. According to
``Time,'' the Tae-Bo videos have grossed $75 million in less than
six months since their release. And 43-year-old Blanks has signed a
$1.5 million advance with Bantam to write an exercise book.
</P>
<P>
   Blanks is also gearing up to release 24 more Tae-Bo tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Target stores are now selling just the Instructional and Basic
tapes as a package for $34.99.
</P>
<P>
   If I had to do it all over again, I'd just buy the first two
tapes, then maybe another tape or two as they came out.
</P>
<P>
   Taking real classes with a real interactive instructor would be
even better.
</P>
<P>
   The four-tape set, selling for $59.85, can be purchased by
calling 1-800-637-6632. Learn more about Billy Blanks and Tae-Bo at

   MIAMI _ Anticipation's been building in Cuba all week: the
Yankees are coming.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not the Yankees exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the Baltimore Orioles will become the first Major League
Baseball team to stand on a Havana diamond in 40 years when they
face off at noon EST Sunday against a 27-man squad of Cuban
all-stars.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, hours later, dozens of U.S. musicians, including
Jimmy Buffett and the Atlanta-based Indigo Girls, will stage a free
invitation-only concert at the Karl Marx theater, also in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball diplomacy. Pop music diplomacy. There seems to be all
kinds of diplomacy going on this weekend between the United States
and its communist archenemy just 90 miles from South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone's in a festive mood.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-line Cuban exiles are outraged, warning that this weekend's
events will do little but provide cheap publicity for Cuba's
repressive leader, Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that these people can still be playing baseball while
the Cuban people are experiencing a new wave of repression is
patently offensive,'' said Alberto M. Hernandez, chairman of the
Cuban American National Foundation, the nation's most powerful
anti-Castro group.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks ago, the Cuban government handed down harsh
prison sentences for four well-known Cuban dissidents who openly
criticized the Communist Party, drawing condemnations from even
Canada and the European Union, countries that want normal trade
with the island to resume.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba also approved a law that imposes severe penalties against
political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics say the events are largely symbolic and don't go
far enough to engage Cuba and end decades of hostility with the
island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe more engagement would give us more leverage in
Cuba's affairs,'' said Damian Fernandez, an expert on Cuba at
Florida International University.
</P>
<P>
   But will these star-studded events lead to an overall warming of
U.S.-Cuba relations? Will Castro _ a former baseball pitcher who
will attend Sunday's game _ provide a symbol of this thaw by
throwing out the first ball?
</P>
<P>
   No one knows the answers.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the events have aroused great interest in baseball-mad
Havana, where the rustic Estadio Latinoamericano _ which seats
50,000 and serves coffee and ham sandwiches _ is expected to be
packed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The last time major league teams played ball in Cuba was in
March 1959, when the Los Angeles Dodgers went to bat against the
Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people here really like Americans, so we're happy to have
so many Americans here,'' said Amado Alvarez, a painter and
baseball fanatic. ``Cuban players are very good, so we are sure
they'll perform well against the Orioles.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Alvarez, tickets for the game won't be made
available to the general public. Rather, they'll be set aside by
the Cuban government for selected groups, such as foreign reporters
and school organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Cable sports network ESPN plans to broadcast the game.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Clinton administration says the cultural
exchanges are an attempt to boost people-to-people contacts, part
of an overall strategy to isolate Castro and foster openness on the
island. Washington authorized the events on Jan. 5 as exceptions to
an economic embargo imposed against Cuba in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans are scheduled to play a return game at Camden Yards
in Baltimore on May 3.
</P>
<P>
   The contacts ``expose the Cuban people to the values of a free
society ... and help them prepare for a better tomorrow,'' said
Michael Ranneberger, the Clinton administration's coordinator of
Cuban affairs.
</P>
<P>
   He said the events shouldn't be seen as moves toward closer ties
with Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Any proceeds from the game will go not to the Castro government,
but to fund sports activities, mostly among Cuban youth.
</P>
<P>
   But even U.S. officials agree that the timing of the events is
ticklish.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Clinton administration's promotion of
people-to-people contacts has made the Cuban government a bit wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the people-to-people contacts are carried out in a
non-political way, then that will be good,'' said Roberto de Armas,
a Cuban government spokesman. ``But if they're used in a political
way, the future of these kinds of contacts could be affected.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Those participating in this weekend's events say politics isn't
even on their radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Carter, who manages the Indigo Girls, say Amy Ray and
Emily Saliers are doing what they love best: collaborating with
other musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amy and Emily have music on their minds, not politics,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Cuba hosted a major American concert was in 1979,
when Billy Joel and Kris Kristofferson performed at an event titled
``Havana Jams.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, more than 40 performers, including Burt Bacharach,
James Taylor, and Gladys Knight, began arriving in Havana for a
week of songwriting and jam sessions with their Cuban counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Roy Scott, the California songwriter behind the exchange
known as ``Music Bridges Over Troubled Waters,'' said Sunday's
concert carries no political overtones.
</P>
<P>
   And neither does the baseball game, said Joe Foss, the Orioles'
vice chairman for business and finance. He said the team hopes the
games ``can help people in the two countries come together.''
</P>
<P>
   But not since the visit to Cuba by Pope John Paul II in January
1998 has such a debate erupted over the future of an ideological
divide that dates back to the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the U.S. Senate approved a resolution 98-0 urging
the Clinton administration to mobilize international pressure for
political change on the island.
</P>
<P>
   The House has passed a similar resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-American members of Congress have chastised the
administration for allowing baseball players and musicians to
travel to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the wrong signal: if the United States can play ball with
Castro, then there can't be any serious problems there,'' said Rep.
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Some liken this weekend's events to the famous ``ping-pong''
diplomacy between the United States and China in the early 1970s,
when a visit by the U.S. national table tennis team helped pave the
way for President Nixon's official talks with China's communist
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But many observers predict the events in Cuba will have little
overall impact on U.S.-Cuba relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't expect relations to get better any time soon,''
said Wayne Smith, who headed the U.S. Interests Section in Havana
during the Carter administration. ``In fact, official relations
could hardly grow any worse.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, relations have deteriorated as Washington
condemned the harsh sentences imposed on the dissidents, and Cuba
cut off most U.S. telephone links due to unpaid bills by American
phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   But if nothing else, Kirby Jones, a Washington consultant, said
this weekend's events have spurred more interest among U.S.
businesspeople in Cuba. He said dozens of U.S. companies have
signed up for a U.S.-Cuba Business Summit scheduled for May 19 in
Cancun, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it is baseball fever, but there appears to be more
interest in Cuba now than there was last year,'' said Jones, who
has already led two business delegations to Cuba. ``The game has
symbolic importance, and it seems to be captivating people even
more than the pope's visit.''

   MIAMI _ Anticipation's been building in Cuba all week: the
Yankees are coming.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not the Yankees exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the Baltimore Orioles will become the first Major League
Baseball team to stand on a Havana diamond in 40 years when they
face off at noon EST Sunday against a 27-man squad of Cuban
all-stars.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, hours later, dozens of U.S. musicians, including
Jimmy Buffett and the Atlanta-based Indigo Girls, will stage a free
invitation-only concert at the Karl Marx theater, also in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball diplomacy. Pop music diplomacy. There seems to be all
kinds of diplomacy going on this weekend between the United States
and its communist archenemy just 90 miles from South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone's in a festive mood.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-line Cuban exiles are outraged, warning that this weekend's
events will do little but provide cheap publicity for Cuba's
repressive leader, Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that these people can still be playing baseball while
the Cuban people are experiencing a new wave of repression is
patently offensive,'' said Alberto M. Hernandez, chairman of the
Cuban American National Foundation, the nation's most powerful
anti-Castro group.
</P>

FLYING THE BUSY SKIES MAY GET MORE STRESSFUL IN YEARS TO COME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 28)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CELINA OTTAWAY  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As airports get more congested and flights fill
up, travelers are spending more time packed tightly into airline
seats. Some are waiting on tarmacs for hours as planes line up for
takeoff. Others are hovering in holding patterns, waiting to land
or diverting to other airports.
</P>
<P>
   Spending extra time in a plane, even in the best of conditions,
means stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sat (on the tarmac) for two, three hours sometimes. You
feel the temperature go up in the plane,'' said Ralph Sargent, who
recently endured a four-hour stress fest of holding patterns and
then a fuel shortage that landed him and his family at the Albany
International Airport. ``People get tense.''
</P>
<P>
   When the waiting follows a stressful ride, the confinement of an
airplane seat can seem unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perspiration began and the plane turned into a steam
bath,'' said Ralph, who had been on what should have been a
relatively short hop from Atlanta to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   In one extreme case, thousands of Northwest Airlines passengers
in Detroit had to sit in planes on the tarmac for up to 11 hours
during a January snowstorm. Toilets overflowed. Many had no food or
water.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is discussing a ``passenger bill of rights'' that would
force airlines to pay compensation to passengers kept waiting on a
runway for more than two hours, require explanation for delays and
cancellations and provide food and restroom facilities during
delays, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,600 planes sat on the ground for more than two hours
last year, according to the Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The future looks worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration predicts that unless airport
capacity increases, congestion and delays at the major hubs will
grow in the next seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Good news for authors John Grisham and Danielle Steel. Bummer
for the rest of us who are trying to stake out some elbow room. Or
battling feelings of claustrophobia.
</P>
<P>
   Regular travelers and psychologists say a simple diversion like
a good book, soothing music or interesting conversation can do a
lot to help.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Chris Saunders of Whitesboro, N.Y., spent an
hour of serious get-to-know-you time on the ground in Syracuse
waiting for his flight for Las Vegas to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just bonding, bonding, everyone bonded,'' he said.
``The longer the time we had to wait, the louder it got on the
plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking to people (if they are friendly) can be one of the best
ways to calm anxieties and use extra time on an airplane, said
Joyce Tanzer, a psychologist with Hillside Hospital in Queens, N.Y.
Tanzer works in the hospital's anxiety and phobia clinic. She uses
a virtual-reality machine to help people with their fear of flying.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in plans and unexpected delays can trigger fearful
thoughts in people who aren't normally afraid of planes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think something must be wrong, if not this plane, then
someone else's, which casts doubts on flying in general,'' Tanzer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Each time the pilot on the Sargents' plane announced another
change, the stress on the plane increased, said Ralph Sargent, who
is from Newbury, Mass. The plane bounced its way to Philadelphia,
then circled the airport for 40 minutes. Finally, the captain
announced that the plane was running low on fuel and they were
going to fly to Albany to land.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting for the next announcement to go _ `the
parachutes are under your seats,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Changes and delays reinforce people's feelings of helplessness,
said Robert A. Greendale, chairman of the department of psychiatry
at Highland Park Hospital in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the stress comes from figuring out how you are going
to cook your kids dinner if you are stranded across the country. Or
worrying that the sales meeting will start without you. For others,
it is a moment of truth to have a little talk with God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying not to lose control,'' Ralph Sargent's wife,
Andrea, said of their rocky flight. ``My son looked at me, and I
said if I start crying what is he going to do? I just stretched my
arm back and grabbed my husband's hand.'' The tears came anyway.

MONICA MANIA LEAVES TV NEWS WITH LITTLE ENERGY FOR WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ We're not in Monicaland anymore.
</P>
<P>
   And it's clear after watching the coverage of the NATO attacks
on Yugoslavia that many broadcast news organizations are rusty at
real news, their instincts and ability to mobilize slackened and
atrophied by more than a year of nonstop yakking about President
Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to sit back and rake in revenue generated from
moralists paid to show up, preach, back their political party, then
do it again the next day _ a programming chess game of infinite
boredom that nevertheless captured the attention of the American
public. It's quite another to prove that your news organization
hasn't suffered so many cuts that you can do little more than mimic
a news conference at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   And so it wasn't surprising that CNN, the most determined
television news organization, had the first pictures among American
news operations of the night bombing in Yugoslavia and, more
importantly, had actual reporters near the action. From the initial
attack, CNN has provided the best coverage but, with President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia kicking out journalists from NATO
countries, the game could revert _ painfully _ back to the studios,
where much of the Lewinsky-Clinton nonsense first took place.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Milosevic lets those journalists back in could be the
key element to what is a major news story. Without proper access,
we're reduced to MSNBC ``news chats'' with blow-dried John Gibson
changing from talk about cigars to talk about collateral damage.
</P>
<P>
   Having survived the titillating revelations about Clinton's
sexual escapades, viewers who define themselves as news junkies
(thus keeping these 24-hour news channels in business) may be
longing for a change of pace.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that the NATO bombings and ethnic fighting
in Yugoslavia could go on for some time. What remains to be seen is
whether the TV news can properly shift gears and report a real
story _ a war.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's clear early on that this will be no Persian Gulf War,
in terms of riveting footage. That was the first time since Vietnam
that TV news dominated with significant war coverage. And even
then, critics complained that the coverage was being manipulated by
the White House and Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Access was even more controlled in post-Gulf War attacks on
Baghdad. At least then Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein let the news
media close to the action. Milosevic's decision, if not reversed,
could lead to the media reporting from further back on the
sidelines than they have been in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   And that means only one thing: the so-called experts.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pretty safe assumption that prolonged exposure to yet
more experts will not rivet viewers. And these are military
experts, often the worst kind because they have a predictable frame
of reference and not the same kind of giddily vicious verbiage that
politically motivated experts used in the Clinton scandal.
</P>
<P>
   One expert, Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution, said
this on MSNBC: ``We need to offer a carrot, not just a stick.
Though we may need a bigger stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Any more of that, and we're all in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   CNN was able to avoid much of the in-studio babble because it
was still working the angle of Christiane Amanpour and Brent Sadler
being booted out of the country, the former by the government, the
latter by ``uncontrolled armed elements harassing journalists,'' in
his words.
</P>
<P>
   Amanpour, probably the most watched foreign correspondent, went
back to Brussels, while Sadler thought he was heading back to the
calm confines of Macedonia, only to find a stream of rock-throwing
protesters heading for anybody with a camera.
</P>
<P>
   Very little footage of the conflict in Yugoslavia was available.
We saw some smoldering homes in Kosovo, allegedly burned as the
Serbs advanced. We saw state-run television pictures in Yugoslavia
shot from a distance, showing burned buildings while the experts
back in the United States tried to say just exactly what those
targets were.
</P>
<P>
   And we saw news conferences, where the answers were short and
the information nonexistent. Again, that leaves a lot of explaining
in the studios, and many networks are opting for the same tactic:
Go to the map.
</P>
<P>
   As Chip Reid said on MSNBC: ``A week ago people didn't know what
Kosovo was.'' Or where it was, for that matter. News channels are
discovering that just like in the Middle East, relentless
explaining is necessary to hook the American viewing public, or it
all just seems like something happening ``over there.''
</P>
<P>
   So this is where we are in the early days of the latest TV war:
Get a map (no one has done this better than Clinton during his
speech to the nation, by the way), point at the highlighted Kosovo
region, have your anchor talk in general terms about how Yugoslavia
has been a bit of a historic hot spot, then smother the rest of the
hour with experts and redundant news footage.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is where the network news from CBS, ABC and NBC can
actually excel. There are so few video elements to show people, and
so little White House or Pentagon information, that the tiny
half-hour allotment of network news may be just right.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the country immediately flips to the 24-hour channels
for thorough coverage, and the networks seem more and more like
news dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   Unless access is widened, however, we'll be left to witness a
talking heads party across the dial.
</P>
<P>

TODAY `THE SIMPSONS,' TOMORROW `FUTURAMA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's almost unfair to judge Matt Groening's latest work. This is
the guy who created ``The Simpsons,'' which with each season moves
farther away from just being the best animated series ever toward
being the best comedy ever.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe if we had never heard of ``The Simpsons,'' we would
have liked ``Futurama'' that much more. Not that it's bad; it's not
bad at all, in fact. Just not all that great yet. Maybe we are all
just spoiled.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, after seeing only one episode, I am willing to give
Groening the benefit of the doubt. He is high on ``Futurama,''
which, with his track record, is enough to make one believe it's
going to be good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Futurama'' will start out twinned with ``The Simpsons,''
airing at 8:30 p.m. EST Sunday and next Sunday on Fox (check local
listings). The show will then move to 8:30 p.m. Tuesdays, creating
an animated block of programming for Fox that night along with
``King of the Hill'' and ``The PJ's.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter the distinctions, the comparisons are inevitable.
Sure, ``Futurama'' takes place 1,000 years into the future, but you
swear you are seeing and hearing various folks from around the
Springfield of ``The Simpsons'' (while only ``Futurama'' has a
one-eyed alien, both shows have three-eyed fish).
</P>
<P>
   There are the same no chins and extended upper mouths, the
oversize eyes and the rolling lips and tongues during shrieks of
terror. Why the similarities? Groening says repeatedly it's because
it's the only way he knows how to draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Futurama'' is the story of Fry, a late-20th-century loser.
It's New Year's Eve 1999, and he is delivering pizza in Manhattan.
After getting dumped by his girlfriend in the quickest brush-off on
record, he realizes the delivery call he is on to the cryogenics
lab is a prank. Accidentally he falls into a cryogenics tube,
which, according to the egg timer on front, is set for 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   While suspended in frozen animated animation, he misses a pair
of alien invasions, both of which destroy New York City. He finally
wakes up on Dec. 31, 2999, to a world that is part ``Jetsons,''
part ``Blade Runner'' and all Groening, from the dogs with jet
packs to walk-in suicide booths.
</P>
<P>
   Free of his miserable job, relationship and life in general, Fry
welcomes the chance to start over in the world. That is, until
Leela (the only one-eyed alien on the planet), who is in charge of
giving the unfrozen their ``permanent job assignments,'' gives Fry
his: Delivery Boy.
</P>
<P>
   There is one drop-dead Simpsonian laugh in the pilot, a riff
which takes place in a museum with preserved and talking heads from
the 20th century, led by Leonard Nimoy. While there are other
strong moments _ one commuter of the future sets off for JFK Jr.
Airport _ you find yourself waiting for a roll-off-the-couch moment
that never comes.
</P>
<P>
   So the inevitable, unwanted but totally relevant question: Is
``Futurama'' as good as ``The Simpsons?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, with no aspersions toward the stepchild, is ``What
is?''
</P>
<P>
   Given time, and Groening, who knows?

 `EDtv' IS AN EASY TURN-OFF  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of Hollywood's more inscrutable mysteries (beyond Keanu
Reeves' career) is its tendency to make two movies with the same
premise at about the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Two movies about computer-somatic bugs. Two movies about large
cosmic objects screaming Earthward. Two movies about the
dehumanizing agonies of American soldiers in World War II. Two
movies about randy Elizabethans (among them Joseph Fiennes) in
tights and ruffled collars.
</P>
<P>
   And now, two more: Ten months after the release of ``The Truman
Show,'' Peter Weir's breathtaking light-dark fantasy about a man
whose life is a television show, we have ``EDtv,'' a felicitously
wacked-out comedy about ... a man whose life is a television show.
</P>
<P>
   His name is, you guessed it, Ed, and he's a nobody who becomes a
somebody when he allows a camera crew to film his every move. Just
imagine the high jinks.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Ron Howard with ample fizz and sharply acted by a
delightful cast, the film is, in fact, so unlike ``The Truman
Show'' in tone and intent that it mostly stands on its own without
comparison. ``EDtv'' isn't profound, and it doesn't bang around the
brainpan with any particular resonance, but it does pack a lot of
big laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, quite a few are generated by Matthew
McConaughey he of the It Boy credentials, sputtering career and
borderline-unspellable name. McConaughey was fresh in ``Dazed and
Confused,'' sleek in ``A Time to Kill,'' presentable in
``Contact,'' appalling in ``Amistad'' and not all bad in ``The
Newton Boys.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``EDtv'' he's an explosion of slacker charm, an also-ran so
uncomplicated by ambition or cunning that he wins audience sympathy
just by cracking his grin. McConaughey has never been this
watchable; he's never been this much fun (although, as the
loser-lothario in ``Dazed,'' he came close).
</P>
<P>
   When we meet Ed, he's playing pool with his big-dreams brother,
Ray (Woody Harrelson, doing a mean twist on his old ``Cheers''
lunk), and sullen pal, John (Adam Goldberg). Ed's a 31-year-old
video store clerk whose metier is lugging beer in a cup-holder
strung around his neck. ``He's gonna spend the rest of his life
rearranging `Ernest' movies,'' gripes his brother.
</P>
<P>
   But when a cable network starts auditioning average joes for a
new, 16-hour-a-day, reality-based show, Ed catches a programmer's
eye he's cute enough to be telegenic, dense enough to act like an
idiot on national television. So they bring him into the network
offices, where a politburo of prickly executives grill him on
sundry topics. (What did he study in college? ``Study?'' he says.
``Jeeeeez, that would've been a big help.'')
</P>
<P>
   Included in this group are Rob Reiner as a pompous mogul and
Ellen Degeneres in distracted-non sequitur mode, wherein she
delivers some of the movie's more bizarro punch lines (``We don't
even have money in the budget for coffee filters. We use
yarmulkes''). Both put cheery bite into their dialogue, penned by
the same team of screenwriters (Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel) who
wrote Ron Howard's ``Parenthood'' and ``Splash.''
</P>
<P>
   But the heart of the film is McConaughey's sweet, dim Ed, a man
so eager to give up his privacy that he clips his toenails for the
camera. The wake-up scene on Day 1 is a vulgar beaut, and the bits
that follow are both smartly staged and stupidly funny; when Ed
drops a hot Pop-Tart (``Whoooo action sequence,'' says Reiner) and
bends to retrieve it, he checks out his rump on television. Dumb?
Sure. But you'll laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Ed sees the downside to this arrangement: It
alienates his brother, embarrasses his mom (Sally Kirkland),
confuses his ailing stepdad (Martin Landau, making great comic hay
of a weak heart), exposes him to fanatical hordes and gums up his
budding romance with Shari (touchingly played by Jenna Elfman of
``Dharma &AMP; Greg''). And as his celebrity grows, he begins to regret
it.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Truman Show,'' ``EDtv'' breaks up the narrative with
quick shots of television viewers gathered around the hearth. We
get the frat boys, the co-eds, the yuppie straight couple, the
yuppie gay couple, even ``the president'' all of them glued to Ed's
every soap-operatic development. This is cute for 15 minutes. By
minute 122 it gets to be a drag.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it the only thing that drags. Howard is a bright, kinetic
filmmaker, but he doesn't always know how to wrap things up; his
movies are just about equally divided between good stories with
obvious endings (``Apollo 13'') and good stories with lousy ones
(``Ransom''). ``EDtv'' is the latter sort.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, it brings Dennis Hopper into the plot, then shunts
him into oblivion after two criminally brief scenes. And the film
is packed to the eyebrows with so many talking-head cameos (Jay
Leno, Ru Paul, George Plimpton, Bill Maher) that the natural
impulse is to grab the remote and fling it at them. Unfortunately,
there is no remote.

 &HT;    PRIVATE FIRMS SEE NO THREAT IN POST OFFICE'S DELIVERY TRACKING
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Postal Service's new delivery confirmation
system is off to a fast start, with officials predicting that more
than 1 million customers will use it during its first month of
service.
</P>
<P>
   But the major private delivery firms said the system poses no
threat to their business.
</P>
<P>
   On March 14, the Postal Service introduced a system that lets
customers verify the delivery of their packages by calling a
toll-free telephone number (800-222-1811) or checking the Postal
Service's Web site (http://www.usps.gov/cttgate/).
</P>
<P>
   The service costs 35 cents for priority mail or 60 cents for
parcel post packages. For customers who send and receive their
shipping information electronically, the service is free for
priority mail costs 25 cents for parcel select and post packages.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry McKiernan, manager of expedited and package services for
the Postal Service, said up to 50,000 customers a day are using the
confirmation system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are finally offering a long overdue service,'' McKiernan
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service had discussed the possibility of offering the
service for 10 years, he said, but was not able to initiate it
until the Postal Board of Governors approved a $700 million
allocation last year.
</P>
<P>
   Private delivery firms said the new service would have no effect
on their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our prospective, this is a non-event,'' said David
Shoenfeld, senior vice president of marketing, customer service and
corporate relations for FedEx. ``It isn't relevant to what our
customers tell us they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoenfeld said the Postal Service can't compete with private
companies because they can't tell the customer when the package was
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Postal Service's new delivery confirmation system only
tells the customer that their package arrived,'' agreed Tad Segal,
spokesman for United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   Segal said that Atlanta-based UPS, which delivers more than 3
billion packages and documents a year, has the ability to track
packages from the moment they are picked up through several
intermediate points to the final destination.
</P>
<P>
   Segal said the fee for the UPS tracking system is included in
the overall price of the shipping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that the Postal Service's new system is a
competitive threat to UPS and other shipping companies right now,''
Segal said.
</P>
<P>
   Shoenfeld agreed, adding, ``what the Postal Service has done is
reinforced the gap between what they are able to do and what
customers expect and can get from private express companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not competing with UPS,'' McKiernan said. ``We are just
offering our customers a reasonably priced product.''

CLINTON GETS FAILING GRADE IN WAR HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Here was President Clinton on television,
pointing to a map of Europe, showing Americans where Serbia and
Kosovo are.
</P>
<P>
   It reminded me of a rule of war many of us have learned over the
last half-century: Never go to war with a country you can't find on
a map.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was pronouncing Kosovo as ``Kasava,'' reminding me of
the way Lyndon Johnson pronounced Vietnam as ``Vit-nam.''
</P>
<P>
   Never go to war in a place you can't pronounce.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave a brief lesson in Balkan history, but he didn't go
back as far as 1389, when the Ottoman Turks slaughtered the Serbian
nobility in Kosovo, leading to a takeover of Serbia that lasted
five centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Never go to war with a country whose national holiday celebrates
a defeat suffered in 1389. These are people ready to take some
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Our national holiday is the Oscars, and we can barely remember
who won last year.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see if we remember some other things we should have
learned.
</P>
<P>
   Never start a war without clear objectives. Never start a war
you don't plan on winning. Never promise everybody, including your
enemy, that you won't send in soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Although please don't. They'd never get out of that place.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright compare
stopping President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to stopping
Hitler, but they're only willing to stand off and shoot our
whiz-bang technology at him.
</P>
<P>
   Once again we're treating missiles and bombs as if they're
messages _ laser-guided 2,000-pound high-explosive e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone deserves a cruise missile in the eye, it's Milosevic.
But he's hiding deep in some concrete bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has slaughtered, raped and pillaged non-Serbs to
maintain his power. He cynically claims he is creating a ``Greater
Serbia'' with successive attacks on other people.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Milosevic will be cowed by cruise missiles the way his
forebears never were by invading Turkish, Austro-Hungarian and Nazi
armies. I certainly hope so, but I doubt it.
</P>
<P>
   Air raids raise national cohesiveness. In Britain, Germany and
North Vietnam, bombings raised morale. The Strategic Bombing Survey
after World War II showed that Germany's production of war materiel
increased under the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam was hit by American raids much larger than the ones in
Serbia, day after day and year after year, yet we lost.
</P>
<P>
   America is the land that invented the airplane and built rockets
for all imaginable purposes. We love gadgets _ all the more if
they're packaged in the deadly shapes of war.
</P>
<P>
   We've never recognized that aircraft never won a war. They
certainly can't do it in a country with the topography of West
Virginia, with no target worth more than the price of a single
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   American news programs devoted more time to the wonders of the
B-2 stealth bomber than to the history of the Balkans. Never mind
that just two of these sluggish billion-dollar bombers labored all
the way from Missouri to Serbia to dump their loads.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``inefficient'' doesn't do justice to the B-2 mission,
especially since the strategic aim was to stop a bunch of thugs in
camouflage uniforms from shooting up peasants' homes with mortars
and AK-47s.
</P>
<P>
   Now members of the Albanian minority in Kosovo are all the more
frightened. Just before the bombs arrived, Dukagjin Gorani, editor
of the KD Times in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, wrote: ``The
fear is that once the airstrikes begin, `the massacre' many of us
feared will finally come.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serb army is acting like beasts already. What better way to
get back at Clinton than to kill those he's trying to protect?
</P>
<P>
   You can't stop a massacre with a B-2.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia has borne grudges for 600 years. It was a Serbian
nationalist who ignited the First World War and in the Second World
War hundreds of thousands of Nazi troops were tied down by
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   We don't have any idea what we're getting into. We certainly
have no idea how to get out.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has maintained his power by conjuring threats from
outside enemies in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo. Now he has the
biggest threat in the world working for him.
</P>
<P>
   There was Clinton telling the country, ``Now, I want to be clear
with you. There are risks in military action ...''
</P>
<P>
   Since when do people have to be told there are risks in military
action? Well, ever since presidents decided that they couldn't
stand the political risk of losing even one American life in
action.
</P>
<P>
   War is now a recurring show on CNN, with stock footage of
aircraft and ships, and bright lights in a green sky. Like
everything else in this country, it's mass entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs don't seem to be treating this war like a show,
though. They confiscated foreign journalists' equipment and ordered
them out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Don't they know this is supposed to be a media war?
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the future, somewhere in Serbia, there will be a
memorial to the battle of 1999. The only question is whether the
Serbs will celebrate it as a victory or as a defeat.

GAME MEAT CONTRIBUTES TO A HEALTHFUL DIET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ While eating healthful foods and losing weight
may seem nearly impossible-to-keep resolutions, the answer for many
people is easier than you might think.
</P>
<P>
   Most game meats have fewer calories and contain less fat than
conventional meats sold at the supermarket. While 100 grams of
uncooked lean hamburger contains 272 calories and 18 grams of fat,
the same amount of deer meat has only 120 calories and 2 grams of
fat. A person can consume 56 percent fewer calories by simply
substituting ground venison for hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   Elk has only 111 calories per 100 grams of meat, and 1 gram of
fat. Antelope has 114 calories with 2 grams of fat; even a meat
considered ``greasy,'' like bear, has only 161 calories and 8 grams
of fat.
</P>
<P>
   As an added bonus, game meat does not contain any of the
steroids or antibiotics often found in retail meats.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, game meat is healthier.
</P>
<P>
   And hunting is a physically demanding activity.
</P>
<P>
   Properly prepared venison, antelope and most wild game have a
flavor that rivals meat found in the grocery store. Regardless of
the recipe, elk or caribou simply tastes better than the finest cut
of beef, pork or chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the fact that sportsmen contribute toward wildlife
conservation through a variety of federal excise taxes, hunting
permits, license fees and voluntary contributions. Through their
efforts, the Rocky Mountain elk, pronghorn antelope and many other
species have been brought back from the brink of extinction.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who oppose hunting, the consumption of meat and,
in fact, any use of animals. Their beliefs have developed after
years of humans being divorced from the land and its often harsh
reality, thanks to our ongoing urban migration. They tout
alternatives to meat consumption that, they say, can also reduce
calorie and fat intake.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, they also dispute _ for purely political reasons
_ the healthful alternative of substituting or adding game meat to
your diet. Some people routinely accept the notion that eating more
healthful foods means eliminating large amounts of meat from the
diet, even though a diet at least partially composed of wild game
meat can be easily adapted to a person's preferred recipes while
providing protein with lower fat and calorie content.
</P>
<P>
   While eating more healthily may seem an insurmountable
challenge, the real challenge is to hold onto those things that are
good while filtering out the din created by media that feed on
politically motivated controversy.

PROTEGE IS COMING OF AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Gas is cheap, and great big trucks are popular, even
among people who have no use for great big trucks.
</P>
<P>
   No one seems terribly interested in small, fuel-efficient cars
anymore, even though there are some real bargains in this segment
and little cars are more fun to drive than sport-utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   As the revamped Mazda Protege shows, entry-level sedans also
have improved greatly, looking good, driving well and offering a
greater level of refinement than ever before. Protege replaced the
323 as Mazda's base car in 1990. But I never really cared for the
previous Protege, which felt tinny and didn't drive all that well.
</P>
<P>
   The new Protege is a significant upgrade. Its construction is
lightweight, but it seems tight and sturdy. Though the ride is
quiet, the engine does get boomy under acceleration or working hard
up grades.
</P>
<P>
   My only solid gripe about the Protege is its generic styling.
Really, if you wanted to design a stealth vehicle to come in under
enemy radar, this is it. It looks strikingly like a Civic clone
from the sides or rear, and if not for the distinctive chrome
mustache above the grille, you'd have no idea what it was when
viewed from the front.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda needs to look across the hall at its U.S. partner, Ford,
to see how to style a small car that catches people's interest. And
that's the new Ford Focus. The New Edge styling of the Focus is
interesting and forward-looking, maybe not to everybody's taste but
at least it won't get lost in a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   At least you won't accidentally climb into your neighbor's Civic
one morning instead of your Protege.
</P>
<P>
   Our test Protege was the top-end ES model, with a boatload of
amenities, an automatic transmission and a larger engine than the
base model. And the price just tops $16,000.
</P>
<P>
   For that, you get a decent-looking vehicle that's reasonably
roomy inside, and that drives comparably with Honda Civic, the
undisputed leader of this subcompact group. But the Protege is
several thousands cheaper than the Civic or its other major
competition, Toyota Corolla and Nissan Sentra.
</P>
<P>
   Base-model Proteges, which come only as four-door sedans, list
at $12,000; a middle-grade LX model goes for a bit more. The lesser
models are saddled with a wimpy 1.6-liter, 105-horse engine instead
of the beefier double-overhead-cam four in our ES.
</P>
<P>
   The tester would have been more fun and interesting with a
five-speed stick shift, which is standard, but the automatic worked
pretty well, not sapping too much power from the small engine. I
don't think it would work all that well with the 1.6, however.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, I'm pretty impressed with the driveability of the
Protege, its secure cornering and exact steering. The ride is soft
enough to absorb bumps, including speed bumps, but it's not in the
least bit wallowing or vague. Mazda touts Protege's stiff
platform/soft springing layout, a formula that has worked well for
European automakers.
</P>
<P>
   Protege is surprisingly roomy inside, with lots of legroom up
front and plenty of space for regulation-size humans in the back.
The trunk is reasonably big, too. Even with the ES model, the
interior is still fairly simple, nowhere near what you'd call
plush. The upgraded stereo system was pretty good, though the rear
speakers were kind of weak.
</P>
<P>
   The Protege represents good value, offering decent refinement
and equipment, especially in the ES version. And you can run rings
around your neighbor's sport-utility vehicle. &QL;

   FARM-AUCTION _ GIBSONVILLE, N.C. _ In another sign of hard times
along Tobacco Road, a growing number of farmers are selling their
equipment at auctions. A big sale is planned Saturday in
Gibsonville, a community near Greensboro where farmers are
grappling with decreasing demand for cigarettes. (A sale preview is
on Friday.) Over the past two years, the U.S. government has

   PASSOVER _ Freedom is the message of this annual holiday that
focuses on the story of Exodus and the journey of the Children of
Israel from slaves in Egypt to contact with God at Mt. Sinai. The
spiritual stuff aside, this is the most observed Jewish holiday and
a celebration that takes weeks of preparation. We explore both the
spiritual dimension of Passover and the nitty-gritty details of
preparing for the eight-day event. (Hendrick, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

   HOME &AMP; GARDENEASTER-TABLETOPS _ If you want to create that party
perfect table for Easter, turn it into a pastel fantasy. Use the
pretty shades of traditionally dyed eggs _ lemon yellow, lavender,
pale green and apricot _ to create a fashionable, tasteful look.
Easter, for Atlanta interior designer Bill Cook, has always been
his favorite holiday. ``It celebrates spring,'' he says. ``And you
have all the wonderful shades of the new season with which to
work.'' As a challenge, we asked Cook to set two contemporary
Easter tables _ an inexpensive look and a pricier version. Although
we used everything new for our settings, you might want to include
nostalgic family favorites on your table. (MJohnson, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS.

   FLA-EXPENSIVE-HOMES _ MANALAPAN, Fla. _ Frank McKinney insists
he's not a gambler, just a developer in tune with what the
mega-wealthy want. The $12 million castle he built in Delray Beach,
Fla. three years ago was one of the country's most expensive houses
built without a buyer lined up. Now, McKinney is set to build his
fourth house so-called spec house: Priced at $39 million, it could
be the most expensive in the world. With a glass-domed rotunda big
enough to seat 150 for dinner, a game room as big as the average
house and a 5,000-square-foot master bedroom suite, McKinney says
this is no wild dream. ``It's a business decision. I think God gave
me a gift to determine what these people want,'' he said. A $12
million spec house is one thing _ but $39 million? (Van de Water,
Palm Beach Post). MOVED TUESDAY.

<P>
   Hillary Clinton's supporters point to Robert F. Kennedy as
shining proof that an outsider with a household name can move to
New York state on a moment's notice and still be elected to the
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It's too easy, but I'll say it anyway: Hillary, you're no Bobby
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   (Ah, that felt good.)
</P>
<P>
   Until now I've resisted jumping into the will-she-or-won't-she
debate about Mrs. Clinton's political ambitions, mainly because I
figured the frenzy was largely the creation of a Washington press
corps suffering from Monica withdrawal syndrome and desperately
seeking another big story.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary for senator? Sounded more like wishful thinking _ fodder
for the topic-starved cable shows _ than a solid possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But the first lady is refusing to issue the outright denial that
would make the story go away. This week Mrs. Clinton acknowledged
making ``lots of calls'' to friends and associates to get their
input, and she was quoted in USA Today as saying she will
``continue speaking out on behalf of the issues that I've spent
more than 25 years working on. Any way I can continue to do that, I
intend to. But the form that will take I really can't predict at
this time.'' So apparently she really is flirting with the idea of
running for the senate, presumably against Rudy Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   How stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Forget, at least for now, about whether Mrs. Clinton would make
a good senator. I'm sure she'd be all right _ better than some, not
as effective as others, certainly not the worst we've ever seen.
(What, she couldn't top Carol Moseley-Braun's legacy?) It just
seems like it would be an incredible blunder, from a political,
personal and practical point of view.
</P>
<P>
   First there's the matter of the campaign itself, which would
have the New York City tabloids salivating like Rottweilers eyeing
a pork chop. The media-loathing Mrs. Clinton would be subjected to
daily headlines and stories about her husband, her daughter, her
friends, her hair, her clothes, her calves, her campaign finances,
her health-care debacle, her own sexual history, you name it. You
think the New York Post would be gentle with her? Puh-lease. If
they've got a photo of Hillary chomping a hot dog with her mouth
open on a bad hair day, it gets played on the front page. Big.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one element of the media factor. In order to get her
message out and compete with the camera-loving Guiliani, the often
snippy first lady would have to submit to interviews with TV
stations from Syracuse to Albany to Buffalo, and she'd have to do
radio segments with the inexplicably powerful Don Imus and the
deservedly influential Howard Stern. If she didn't, she'd get
buried. Hillary could barely maintain a cheery facade with Matt
Lauer and Steve Kroft; how's she going to grit her way through the
local stuff and the radio goofing she no doubt believes is beneath
her dignity?
</P>
<P>
   Running for senator also means Mrs. Clinton wouldn't have time
to write the book that could erode a hefty portion of the family's
legal bills. Even if she did find the time and the ghostwriter to
churn out an autobiography, how forthcoming is she going to be if
she's eyeing the senate? And if it's not going to be a revealing,
intimate work, the advance will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign also means Hillary will have to at least temporarily
eschew the $100,000 speaking fees, the lucrative corporate board
memberships, the law firm partnership and the many other financial
opportunities that would undoubtedly be awaiting the most
fascinating first lady since Jacqueline Kennedy. You can't fly to
Japan and accept a $1 million speaking fee _ not if you're in the
middle of a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As for the race itself, the risk isn't worth the reward. Right
now, Mrs. Clinton is enjoying unprecedented public favor, and as a
former first lady her stock would only rise.
</P>
<P>
   That would all change with a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   If Hillary wins, she's the junior senator from New York. She
gets a windowless office and a smallish staff, and she'll have to
suck up to veterans who barely got the time of day from her when
she lived in the White House. When she visits her former residence,
she'll have to wait in reception lines to say hello to the new
first lady, be it Mrs. Gore or Mrs. Bush or Mrs. Underdog. That'll
kill her.
</P>
<P>
   If she loses _ and I think she would _ her social, professional
and financial clout would be diminished.
</P>
<P>
   The media want to see a Clinton-Giuliani race because it would
make for great copy. Democrats want to see Mrs. Clinton run because
they think she's the best hope of keeping that senate seat. Bubba
probably would favor it because he owes Hillary big-time and this
will be a chance for him to blabber about how his wife is the
greatest thing since the invention of the intern.
</P>
<P>
   My question is, why in the world would Hillary want to do it?

IS MICROSOFT MOVING TO SETTLE? U.S. SAYS NO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (lh) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The way the Justice Department sees it, if
Microsoft Corp. and the government are to begin talks to settle the
antitrust suit now at issue in federal court here, Microsoft will
have to make the first move. So far, that has not happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not received any settlement proposal from Microsoft,''
Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein, head of the Justice
Department's antitrust division, said Monday in response to a
report in The Wall Street Journal that Microsoft had indicated an
interest in settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is presiding at the antitrust
trial, has indirectly urged both sides to reach for a settlement
during the recess that began at the end of February. The trial is
scheduled to resume in April.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides say they are open to such discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says it is willing to show flexibility on some issues
but not others, noting, as one executive put it, that ``settling
this case without the need for more protracted litigation would be
good for everyone concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement Monday, Klein said, ``The Justice Department
has always been and remains open to a settlement that fully
protects consumers and assures that similar antitrust violations do
not occur in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The issues on which Microsoft is expressing a willingness to
negotiate are generally those on which the company has already
shown flexibility in the market. Over the last year, it has
loosened some of its restrictive contracts with Internet companies
and has allowed computer manufacturers to customize the opening
screen of the Windows operating system to a degree. But the company
says it is not willing to negotiate in the areas that seem most
important to the Justice Department and the 19 states that are
pressing the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any settlement must preserve Microsoft's ability to add new
features to our operating system as technology advances,'' a
company executive who demanded anonymity said Monday. With that,
Microsoft is signaling its unwillingness to give up the ability to
bundle other software products with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The inclusion of the Microsoft Web browser with Windows set off
the antitrust suit. A three-judge appeals court panel ruled in a
related case last June that Microsoft had the right to add new
features to Windows, if the addition benefited consumers. Based on
comments and questions he has posed in court, however, it is not at
all clear that Jackson believes that the inclusion of a Web browser
with Windows has significantly benefited consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department wants Microsoft to make the first move
toward settlement talks because government lawyers think they have
the upper hand after more than four months in court in which they
threw the credibility of many Microsoft witnesses into doubt. But
Microsoft's lawyers also believe they have presented a strong case.
So even if settlement talks begin before the trial resumes, lawyers
on both sides say the odds of success are long.

&HT;        CLINTON ORDERS AIR ATTACK, GOVERNMENT STAFFERS ORDER PIZZA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, March 25 -- Local pizza delivery folks know if
there's a crisis consuming the nation's capital, government
staffers will be consuming pizza.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton Wednesday night ordered air attacks in
Yugoslavia to halt a Serbian offensive in Kosovo, Domino's pizza
stores delivered a record high number of pizzas to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a case of war and pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Domino's stayed open an hour later Wednesday to accommodate the
800 pizzas ordered by Pentagon staffers. On a typical day, the
Pentagon will order about 75 pizzas, said Frank Meeks, owner of 59
area Domino's stores.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's previous record was 750 pizzas ordered during the
Persian Gulf crisis, Meeks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pentagon workers didn't seem as confident during this Kosovo
crisis as they did during the Persian Gulf War,'' Meeks said his
delivery staff observed. ``I think they are a little more worried
about this one. It's tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeks said Washington's appetite for power and scandal seems to
correlate with its hunger for pizza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was starting to miss Monica Lewinsky and impeachment, which
we called 'impizzament,''' Meeks said. ``But something always
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House had just under 500 Domino's pizzas delivered
Wednesday night, nowhere near its record of 1,000 delivered when
the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke in January of last year, Meeks
said. The White House typically orders about 50 a day from
Domino's.
</P>
<P>
   Since last weekend, about 100 pizzas a day have been delivered
to the State Department. There are usually only 10 pizzas delivered
a day, according to Meeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must have been considering the Kosovo issue for a while,
trying to work it out because they've been ordering pizzas since
last week,'' Meeks said. ``They are a bunch of intellectuals who
typically don't eat much pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   This week offices on Capitol Hill ordered about 500 pizzas a
day, which is more than its usual 200. It doesn't come close to
Domino's record for the Hill, when it delivered 1500 pizzas the day
the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Meeks said government staffers favor pepperoni as a topping, but
tend to order a larger amount of toppings, depending on the
severity of a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are stuck in their offices so they want pizza to deliver
more food groups to them,'' Meeks said. ``They want it to sustain
them for as long as possible.''

LAWMAKERS PUSH BAN ON INTERNET GAMBLING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (EDs: RECASTS lede, pickup 2ndgraf: Internet gambling))  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN   c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   WASHINGTON
_ Under pressure from state law enforcement officials, lawmakers on
Tuesday renewed a push to enact legislation that would ban gambling
over the Internet.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet gambling is estimated to be a $600 million per year
business and is growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet gambling is a serious issue,'' Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.,
said during a Senate Judiciary panel hearing on the issue. Kyl,
chairman of the Technology, Terrorism, and Government Information
Subcommittee, estimates more than $1 billion will be gambled over
the Internet this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet gambling enhances the addictive nature of gambling
because it is so easy to do. You don't have to travel. You can just
log on to your computer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Legal gambling is a $50 billion annual industry that includes
casinos, slot machines, state lotteries and horse and dog-track
racing. It is regulated by states that have varying laws on
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   State attorneys general have asked Congress for a federal ban on
Internet gambling because they argue they cannot police such
activity on a global network that defies state borders. They say
they cannot enforce Internet gambling even if states have their own
laws that ban such activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gambling is already one of the most regulated industries in
the world, yet the Internet of one of the most heavily unregulated
and inherently difficult phenomena to regulate in modern time,''
said Ohio Attorney General Betty Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular form of Internet wagering is sports betting,
but casino-type games are becoming more popular as the Internet
becomes faster.
</P>
<P>
   Current federal law makes placing a bet or sending gambling
information over telephone lines illegal, but the 1961 law predates
the Internet. Most computer users connect to the Internet through
phone lines but it is also possible to use cable television lines
and satellites, technically skirting federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect the Internet creates a loophole in gambling laws,''
said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Justice Department charged 21 owners and managers
of Internet gambling firms with illegally violating the 1961
telephone law, but law enforcement officials say the federal law
still needs updating to give authorities a good chance of
successfully prosecuting Internet gambling operators. Eight people
pleaded guilty, one is fighting the charges and the others remain
at-large.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl plans to reintroduce legislation this week that would ban
gambling on the Internet. It would impose fines equal to the amount
that a business received over the Internet or $20,000, whichever is
greater, and impose prison sentences of up to four years on those
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would require Internet providers such as America
Online to cut service for any illegal gambling site upon a state or
federal court order. The Senate passed a similar bill 90-10 last
year but the issue never made it to the House floor. House
lawmakers are also expected to reintroduce the legislation this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Saum, the director of agent and gambling activities at the
National Collegiate Athletic Association, said Internet gambling is
attracting growing numbers of students who place sports wagers on
the Internet with credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``A growing consensus of research reveals that the rates of
pathological and problems gambling among college students are
higher than any other segment of the population,'' Saum said. Many
college students have access to the Internet as well as easy access
to credit cards that are marketed on campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Internet gambling sites typically require people to open an
account by providing a credit card number. Most sites require a
deposit of about $250 in order to play. Bets on sports teams, for
example, can range from 25 cents to hundreds of dollars. Betting
losses are charged to the credit card while winnings are posted as
credits, although in some cases gamblers report that they never
received their winnings.
</P>
<P>
   People can also play poker, blackjack and a variety of other
card and dice games with the click of a computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   There are almost 300 Internet gambling sites, up from about 15
just two years ago and recent studies have suggested that people
are increasingly becoming addicted to Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl and other lawmakers admit that federal legislation won't
stop all Internet gambling, especially in cases where gambling
operators set up shop overseas, which is a common practice.
Countries like Antigua, Costa Rica and Grenada license Internet
gambling sites.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery argued that a federal ban on Internet gambling would
still be useful because ``a public stance of prohibition tells
consumers that they should be extremely wary of Internet
gambling.''

ONLINE PRIVACY GROUP DECIDES NOT TO PURSUE MICROSOFT CASE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (ATTN: Wash., Calif.)   (jw) 
 By JERI CLAUSING c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Monday, a nonprofit watchdog group founded to
monitor online privacy policies scolded but declined to pursue an
audit of one of its biggest donors, Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It was an awkward decision, both because of Microsoft's
contributions to the group, TRUSTe, and because it comes at a
crucial point in negotiations between the United States and the
European Union over whether companies can effectively police
themselves in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   TRUSTe, a Santa Barbara, Calif.-based nonprofit organization,
monitors the Internet privacy policies of about 500 companies. The
group's officers said that Microsoft had compromised consumer
privacy and trust with an identifying number in its Windows 98
operating system that was surreptitiously collecting consumer data.
</P>
<P>
   But it found no privacy violations involving information
collected through the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, TRUSTe's certification process covers data that
is collected specifically by microsoft.com, a TRUSTe licensed
site,'' TRUSTe said in declining to seek an independent audit of
Microsoft's practices or to revoke its seal of approval.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates heavily criticized the decision and the
distinction on which it was based.
</P>
<P>
   ``It illustrates the fact that these seals don't deliver the
real privacy protection that people want and deserve, and
self-regulation is sham regulation,'' said Jason Catlett, president
of Junkbusters Corp., who filed the complaint with TRUSTe.
</P>
<P>
   Catlett called for an immediate investigation of Microsoft by
the Federal Trade Commission, saying the TRUSTe decision showed
``that self-regulation has failed for a systemic reason that we can
expect to see repeated.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the decision was seen as a sticky one for TRUSTe.
Microsoft, a premier corporate partner, contributed $100,000 to the
group.
</P>
<P>
   And it comes at time when the United States is involved in
intense negotiations to persuade the European Union that
self-regulation and self-enforcement of data privacy practices are
effective enough to meet a stringent new EU privacy law that
threatens to disrupt electronic commerce between the United States
and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A key provision of that law prohibits any company doing business
in the European Union from transmitting personal data to any
country that does not guarantee comparable privacy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, while a representative of the European Union was in
Washington for negotiations, the Better Business Bureau started its
own seal program to monitor the posted privacy practices of Web
sites.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Catlett's complaint, which was sent to TRUSTe on March 12,
stemmed from recent reports that the latest version of Microsoft's
Windows generates a unique serial number that can gather private
information from users even when they request to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   ``In TRUSTe's opinion, the investigation confirmed that the
technology `bug' already acknowledged by Microsoft did transfer
Hardware IDs to the Microsoft secure server regardless of whether
users chose to send this information or not,'' TRUSTe wrote in a
statement posted on its Web site Monday afternoon. ``While this
event does not fall within the boundaries of the TRUSTe License
Agreement, it did, in TRUSTe's opinion, compromise consumer trust
and privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the company was made aware of what had occurred, it took
the necessary action to remedy the problem.'' Microsoft applauded
TRUSTe for its investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that we believe that the system and process in
place by TRUSTe worked well here,'' said Tom Pilla, a spokesman for
the company, which is based in Redmond, Wash. ``A watchdog
complaint was filed. TRUSTe conducted a thorough investigation in
keeping with its standard operating procedure. After a thorough
review of the facts, it publicly issued its decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Catlett agreed that TRUSTe ``diligently did what they were
constitutionally able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``By design, that is very little. They did rebuke
Microsoft. But they didn't call in an auditor. They haven't caused
any consequences for Microsoft other than this rebuke. It really
demonstrates that self-regulation is a toothless tiger.''

&HT;        TRUCK SAFETY ADVOCATES WANT FEDERAL OVERSIGHT ``SHAKEN UP''
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, March 26 -- Highway safety advocates criticized the
federal agency that oversees large trucks because they say it is
too close to the industry it regulates to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Calling for a shake-up of the Office of Motor Carriers, safety
advocates urged a congressional panel Thursday to rethink oversight
of the trucking industry. ``What we have with the Office of Motor
Carriers is a cultural problem of avoiding action and working
closely with the industry,'' said Joan Claybrook, of the Advocates
for Highway and Auto Safety. ``It needs a major cultural change.''
</P>
<P>
   Both highway safety advocates and trucking industry officials
testified at the third and final hearing planned in a series that
examined the OMC's role in truck safety.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. House of Representatives Ground Transportation
Subcommittee may decide to hold more hearings or make
recommendations to the House Transportation Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Mooney Tierney, of Citizens for Reliable and Safe
Highways, said the OMC uses biased research when forming safety
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Tierney said she thinks there was a conflict of interest when
the OMC hired an arm of the American Trucking Association to
conduct the $4.5 million study on driver fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Transportation dismissed the study,
criticizing its design and methodology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be angrier at the lack of movement by OMC,''
Tierney said. ``It is staggering how the number of deaths increase
and the industry and government continue to work together on the
spin that it's because there are more trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing a rise in truck related deaths, and recent reports that
showed the OMC had insufficient data on crashes and is too slow to
implement safety programs, safety advocates say the agency should
be restructured.
</P>
<P>
   Claybrook and several other safety advocates suggest the OMC
should no longer be a part of the Federal Highway Administration,
which has a primary focus on infrastructure and development. They
say the OMC should instead be moved under the authority of the
National Highway Transportation Safety Board, which has a focus on
safety programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Motor Carrier safety will be put first and safety regulations
and enforcement policy will not be initially filtered through
layers of freight productivity goals, safety standards
exemptions,'' Claybrook said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government oversees more than 490,000 trucking
businesses and 6 million drivers.
</P>
<P>
   While the rate of fatalities per 100 miles traveled by large
trucks has stayed steady in the last few years, the number of
actual deaths has increased. Deaths have jumped 20 percent from
4,462 in 1992 to 5,355 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But truck industry officials say there is a rise in
truck-related deaths, because of an increase in trucks on the roads
and more miles traveled. Walter B. McCormick, Jr., president of the
American Trucking Associations, Inc., said there should be a
separate Motor Carrier Administration created to oversee the OMC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trucking industry and motoring public deserve a federal
agency that has trucking and truck safety as its core mission,''
McCormick said.

GATES BOOK OFFERS A STUDY IN CONTRASTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (ms) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Which is the real Bill Gates?
</P>
<P>
   Is it the author who insists, in his new book, ``Business (AT)
the Speed of Thought,'' that all interoffice communications should
flow ``over e-mail so workers can act on news with reflex-like
speed'' _ adding that meetings should not be ``used to present
information'' because ``it's more efficient to use e-mail''?
</P>
<P>
   Or is it the witness who testified in the government's antitrust
case against his company that he could not remember dozens of
e-mail messages he wrote or received in recent years, dismissing
one long internal message full of market data, by saying ``I don't
know what we're talking about'' and ``I mean, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft Corp., never mentions the
antitrust trial in the 470-page book, which his publisher, Warner
Books, a unit of Time Warner Inc., will begin selling next week. It
is a treatise on a favorite theme, the notion that just about every
corporate problem can be helped if not solved with the right
hardware and software, or ``digital infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates speaks of a ``digital nervous system'' and ``living the
Web lifestyle'' _ phrases that many Microsoft employees repeat in
conversation like the favored sayings of Chairman Mao. So it is
probably true that the voluble, enthusiastic Gates selling his
vision in this book more closely approximates the man than the
guarded, argumentative and poorly informed defense witness.
</P>
<P>
   The difference might have proved damaging to Microsoft, since it
could be perceived as undermining the credibility of Gates'
testimony. But it appears that damage is already done. Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson, who is hearing the case in U.S. District Court,
has already said he does not consider Gates an effective witness.
</P>
<P>
   While the antitrust suit being pressed by the federal government
and 19 states is not alluded to even obliquely in this book, many
of Gates' ideas and assertions do collide with parts of Microsoft's
defense in court.
</P>
<P>
   For example, throughout the book, Gates describes how he has
pushed Microsoft employees to do absolutely everything on line,
practically banishing paper. He demanded a few years ago to be
shown every paper form in use at Microsoft and then promptly banned
most of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As this book goes to press,'' he writes, ``we have reduced the
number of paper forms from more than 1,000 to a company-wide total
of 60 forms.''
</P>
<P>
   When the blueprint for an office building on Microsoft's campus
could not be located immediately, Gates recalls, he insisted that
every blueprint and related paper for every structure Microsoft
owns be digitized and made available on line.
</P>
<P>
   He argues forcefully that a key to success is placing all sales
and marketing data on a company's intranet so everyone can see and
use it. ``There's incredible value in letting everybody involved
with a product, even the most junior team member, understand the
history, the pricing. They should be seeing their sales numbers,
expense breakdown, vendor and contractor costs and the status of
major projects on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing your numbers is a fundamental precept of business.''
</P>
<P>
   How, then, to explain the testimony of a key Microsoft witness,
Richard L. Schmalensee, dean of the Sloan School of Management at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, when asked if he had
made any attempt to determine from the company's records ``how much
of Microsoft's reported profits come from operating systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee answered: ``I was surprised, but I will be honest
with you, the state of Microsoft's internal accounting systems do
not always rise to the level of sophistication one might expect
from a firm as successful as it is. They record operating system
sales by hand, on sheets of paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee may get an opportunity to address this seeming
contradiction; he is expected to be one of the rebuttal witnesses
Microsoft calls when the trial resumes next month.
</P>
<P>
   Gates does offer a detailed narrative of his company's long road
to the Internet, a story that dovetails with Microsoft's
presentations on the subject in court but that government lawyers
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1993, we were not focused on the Internet,'' he writes.
``It was a fifth or sixth priority.'' The only Internet presence at
Microsoft then, he recalls, was a demonstration set up on a folding
table in an office hallway, ``with handwritten instructions'' and
cables held in place with duct tape.
</P>
<P>
   But several junior employees hectored him and other executives
to pay attention, he writes; by the spring of 1994, after many
meetings, he announced in an e-mail to his staff, ``We are going to
make a big bet on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, that was only two days after Netscape
Communications Corp. had been founded. The government charges that
a key motivation for Microsoft's Internet strategy was to undermine
Netscape, the most important competitor in what was then an infant
market. In particular, the government contends that Microsoft
decided to bundle the Internet Explorer, its Web browser software,
with the Windows operating system to gain competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Microsoft's current strategy to counter that charge is
to stop using the word ``browser.'' At Microsoft, it seems, the
word is banned. Internet Explorer is not a browser at all, company
executives say. It is a package of ``Web browsing technologies''
that is part of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   At Gates' deposition, government lawyers questioned him about
this, asking, ``Is there an effort on your part or, insofar as you
are aware, on other people's parts, to change the way words are
used'' as a means of advancing Microsoft's case? He gave no clear
answer.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally executives do slip and utter the B word. Among them
is Gates. On page 163, he notes that, after years of lagging in
Internet software and services, ``now we lead in several major
Internet areas and have a growing number of people using our
browser.''

'90S' `MOD SQUAD' IS OLD HAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remaking ``The Mod Squad'' is like cheating off one of the
dumber kids in class: Shame! Still, before director Scott Silver is
banished to the principal's office for copying, he gets a few props
for staying within the lines of the original show.
</P>
<P>
   It's glossy, stylish and uniquely disembodied from any
recognizable social universe _ a long-form visual brochure for a
minimalist, get-up-and-go-go lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is as simple as the title: Three hyper-styled
young-buck derelicts have been ostracized from quotidian Los
Angeles life. As retribution for past sins, which include drug
addiction, petty theft and, in one case, just being an angry
brother, Linc (Omar Epps), Julie (Claire Danes) and Pete (Giovanni
Ribisi) have to wear second-skin leathers and denims, be badgeless
cops and look mad, as if they haven't eaten in days or somebody
just scuffed their Kenneth Coles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mod Squad'': a television show so desperate to become a
movie that Aaron Spelling, its original producer, gave his wrinkled
thumbs up and worked as co-executive producer of the movie. The
film is a cooly synthetic pleasure more enjoyable as a mellow
swatch of kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   While all the original ideas in Hollywood are drying up, what we
have here is an experience similar to watching a flip-book of the
ads that outweigh the articles in XL coffee-table mags like Vibe
and The Face.
</P>
<P>
   Linc's idea of effective crime-fighting and ending foot chases
is still leaping onto the chasee, though Epps is built more Richard
Roundtree's Shaft than the Linc Clarence Williams III created.
</P>
<P>
   Julie remains a glamour puss, though Danes' version, with a
supporting performance by her midriff, is a reformed drug abuser
and recovering alcoholic.
</P>
<P>
   It's Pete who undergoes the drastic make-over from Michael
Cole's smarmy matinee idol to Ribisi's bumbling shout-out to rich
white boys who turn to crime and vintage clothing when their
parents are too busy to love them.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about the film apes the original's 1968-'72 era, from
the horns, Moogs and wah-wah guitars of BC Smith's score to the way
Ellen Krause's photography nails those super-quick, super-tight,
panned close-ups of exit doors and clenched jaws in motion.
</P>
<P>
   The Mod Squad is also a peculiar vanishing point where the '70s
become indistinguishable from the '90s. When a new Curtis Mayfield
tune pours over the soundtrack with Lauryn Hill singing in the
background, what decade it is becomes even more vague.
</P>
<P>
   But where the show's rescue the troubled youth agenda was a sign
of the Vietnam- and the civil rights-era's most volatile years, the
film feels like mere late-'90s product when it could have been a
brilliant reconsideration of the times. Working from a script he
co-wrote with Steven Kaye and Kate Lanier, Silver never allows the
movie to breathe contemporary air and get gang-related, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   Silver's ``Mod Squad'' could use a bit of the sordid. As if the
very fact that it's a rip-off weren't enough, it's virtually
suspenseless and too antiseptic for its R rating. These kids don't
really drink, they don't do drugs, they're not very kinky, and Linc
only gets to look virile. Don't they have any vices?
</P>
<P>
   The film never stoops to posturing, even when its most appealing
features are empty. But you can't help suspecting that if ``The Mod
Squad'' were a T-shirt, it would be made of some processed fabric
like lycra or polyester, and it would read: ``I went to see the Mod
Squad and all I got was this jive turkey.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Paper dolls still cling to the walls of the
deserted loft where Purple Moon LLC sought and failed to make a
viable business out of computer games for girls _ titles that in
contrast to current top-sellers, were not about eyeshadow
selection, nail-polish tricks or adventures around the pressing
question, ``Where's Ken?''
</P>
<P>
   The cut-outs, representing girls of different colors and sizes
kicking soccer balls and holding hands, reflect the company's goal
of creating a Barbie alternative that would inspire preteen-age
girls to embrace the personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Purple Moon's chief executive and sole remaining
employee, Nancy Deyo, looked as forlorn as the abandoned dolls as
workers arrived to cart away the last copying machine.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, the deal she had been struggling to close when
the company ran out of money last month went through _ albeit in a
much-altered form. In a move that seemed bittersweet if financially
pragmatic, Barbie's corporate parent, Mattel Inc., announced plans
to purchase Purple Moon's assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Purple Moon made a difference for girls, and I'm proud
to have done that,'' Ms. Deyo said.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the story of Purple Moon mirrors that of hundreds
of Silicon Valley start-ups that spend millions of dollars each
year only to fail before they can change the world and make huge
returns for their owners in an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Small and unknown, Purple Moon faced an unforgiving battle for
shelf space with Mattel, which had 6 of the top 10 girls' titles
last year _ all Barbie themes _ according to PC Data, a market
research firm. The four others featured Madeline, French heroine of
the much-loved children's books, in titles published by the
Learning Company, which Mattelalso is acquiring.
</P>
<P>
   That Mattel was eager to scoop up Purple Moon's products _ for
an undisclosed sum _ helps refute assertions that the small
company's failure confirms that girls just want to play Barbie
Magic Hair Styler.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel said it planned new titles based on Rockett, Purple
Moon's spunky heroine, who favors spiky orange bangs and such
issues as whether to join the popular clique at school. The Los
Angeles-based Mattel also was impressed by the popularity of Purple
Moon's World Wide Web site, which has 250,000 registered users.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree with the research they've done to show that there is
a different way for girls to play with computers,'' said David
Haddad, president of Mattel Media.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when electronic commerce and Internet portal sites
are the darlings of Wall Street, Purple Moon's business failure
invites scrutiny of the steps and missteps that led to the
dismissal of the company's 40 employees _ at more than 80 percent
women, the reverse of Silicon Valley's typical gender ratio _ on
Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild of Brenda Laurel, a game designer whose credits
include Atari in the early 1980s, Purple Moon evolved from her work
at Interval Research Corp., which was financed by Microsoft's
co-founder Paul Allen. Over four years, Ms. Laurel interviewed
1,000 girls in researching how to apply the principles of their
play to computer games.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the company was spun off, underwritten by Interval
and Allen's Vulcan Ventures, it seemed clear to Ms. Laurel that
girls were not turned off by the violence in boys' games so much as
they found dying and starting over again tedious. Boys liked overt
competition; girls liked covert competition. Boys liked superheroes
and fantastical adventures; girls liked challenges they could
recognize in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brenda thought it through better than anyone else, and it
still failed,'' said Henry Jenkins, director of comparative media
studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Jenkins, an
editor of ``From Barbie to Mortal Kombat,'' an anthology on gender
and computer games published by MIT Press, added, ``That's very
frustrating and very worrisome.''
</P>
<P>
   The company used radical game features like emotional navigation
and relationship hierarchies to carve out a space for girls in a
market that had long been aimed at boys.
</P>
<P>
   The approach attracted plenty of media attention. ``A ROM of
Their Own,'' a Time magazine headline proclaimed before Purple Moon
introduced its first products.
</P>
<P>
   Spending was not spared. Early on, at a company retreat, the
development team role-played the proposed game characters to try to
understand their inner lives. In Christmas seasons, Purple Moon
bought television advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The exhaustive research in which the company had its roots
continued with 25 additional studies. One, an ethnographic study of
girls' interest in sports, led to a product line featuring soccer,
which Mattel appears least interested in continuing. Some critics
argue that Purple Moon's strong focus on research proved no
substitute for more nimble business strategies.
</P>
<P>
   It is a criticism that Ms. Laurel acknowledged in her keynote
address to the Computer Game Developer's Conference in San Jose,
Calif., on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promised to talk to you about some approaches to research
and design that will help us grow both our audiences and our
ideas,'' she said, addressing the pony-tails-and-sneakers crowd in
a green print dress, horn-rimmed glasses and sensible shoes. ``But
since Purple Moon did not make it to the big IPO or a lavish
acquisition that made everybody rich, it would be understandable
for you to conclude that the methods I'm advocating don't
necessarily work.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Ms. Laurel _ who said she had spent the last few
weeks answering e-mail from parents and girls distraught at the
news that Purple Moon was no more _ blamed tough competition, bad
timing and perhaps unrealistic expectations by her private
investors.

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a fundamental disagreement over how the company
should be valued,'' said Ms. Laurel, a board member and the
company's vice president for design.
</P>
<P>
   Purple Moon had been seeking a buyer since the board decided
last fall that a public stock offering was out of reach, she said.
Even so, she said she was surprised when the investors, including
Institutional Venture Partners of Menlo Park, Calif., and the
investment banker Allen &AMP; Co. gave up, in part because she believed
that the deal being discussed with Mattel could be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. Laurel and Ms. Deyo now say that they should have
considered exit strategies sooner. But others close to the company
criticized Ms. Laurel's grasp of business.
</P>
<P>
   David Liddle, chairman of both Interval and Purple Moon, said:
``Did Interval make a lot of money from this? No, I was
disappointed. We had hoped the company would be big and successful
on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its business failings, Ms. Laurel suggests, Purple Moon
may have helped broaden girls' attitudes toward technology and the
software industry's attitude about girls and technology.
</P>
<P>
   According to PC Data, the market for girls' CD-ROM titles grew
38 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel says it will soon offer a line of interactive products
that includes Barbie, a series based on American girls in different
historical periods, and Rockett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to have created value,'' Ms. Laurel said. ``It would
have been nice to have created enough value to send my kids to
college. But I certainly got an education.''

SURVEY SUGGESTS CONSUMERS ARE TAKING TO E-COMMERCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   New evidence that the rise of electronic commerce is a wave, not
a bubble, comes from Odyssey, a market research firm. In survey
results to be released Monday, Odyssey found that half of the
American households that are online are making purchases over the
Internet, and that the total number of online purchases in the last
six months jumped fourfold from the comparable period a year
earlier, to 56 million.
</P>
<P>
   The spike in online shopping during the year-end holidays has
been much reported, discussed and analyzed. But most of the
research on the phenomenon has come from retailers' estimates of
sales, while the Odyssey survey is from the consumer perspective.
Every six months, the San Francisco-based researcher interviews
2,500 randomly selected households by telephone, asking them about
their use of personal computers and electronics gear.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent Odyssey study, conducted in January, points to a
clear trend: more people are making purchases on line, more often,
and they are using advertisements they see on the World Wide Web to
make decisions about what to buy.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of online shopping has been fueled by the falling
price of personal computers. Today, half of American households
have personal computers, up from 42 percent a year ago, according
to Odyssey. The percentage of all households on line has increased
to 33 percent from 23 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But online shopping is growing even faster than the increase in
computer use and Internet access. Of households with Internet
access, 47 percent made at least one purchase on line in the latest
six months, up from 30 percent a year ago, Odyssey reports. Of the
households buying on line, the average number of purchases is 3.7
over the last six months, compared with 1.7 purchases in the
year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appeal of electronic commerce, even in its current nascent
state, keeps consumers coming back,'' said Nicholas Donatiello,
president of Odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to say how much of the rise in online shopping
is a result of tireless promotion of electronic commerce by America
Online; but that is a big factor. Some 40 percent of all households
with access to cyberspace get there through America Online _ 10
times the share of its nearest rivals, Microsoft's MSN and AT&AMP;T's
Worldnet, Odyssey reports.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to garner a larger proportion of its revenue from
advertising and transactions, America Online has encouraged its
subscribers to try online shopping. ``What America Online does is
what happens in this market, because it is so dominant,''
Donatiello said.

SOFTWARE SIMULATIONS LEAD TO BETTER ASSEMBLY LINES

<P>
   Without question, this has been the decade in which software
moved, big time, into the industrial designer's world. In corporate
offices across the country, engineers have been booting up programs
that let them tinker, in three dimensions, with every permutation
and combination of a product's design. Be the item as lowly as a
dinner plate or as complex as a Boeing 777 jet, the goal has always
been the same: to save time and money in getting products to
market.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a matter of time before engineers would aim their
computers at designing and refining the assembly lines on which
those products are made. And apparently, that time has come. To
wit:
</P>
<P>
   _ Before it approves a design for a new car or van, Ford Motor
Co. checks the plan against computer models of its factory floor.
Often, through subtle changes like relocating a few seams or
shaving a few millimeters from the length of a fender, Ford can lop
weeks off the time it takes to prepare an old plant to make a new
car.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dow Chemical Co. now uses computers to simulate its methods
for making plastics, running what-if scenarios to fine-tune the
temperatures, pressures and rates at which it feeds in raw
materials. Dow can now switch production among 15 different grades
of plastics in minutes, with almost no wasted material. Before
computer modeling, the process took two hours and yielded lots of
useless by-products.
</P>
<P>
   _ International Business Machines Corp., the world's largest
computer maker and an early convert to factory simulation software,
has learned that its assembly lines can accommodate diverse
products of similar size, as long as IBM tweaked its conveyor belts
to deliver different parts and products to different work areas.
One early result: With almost no retooling, IBM expanded a plant in
Charlotte, N.C., that had made only banking systems to include
voice messaging systems, bar code readers and devices to program
pacemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to build a new assembly line, if they can reuse
the one they have,'' said Frank Lerchenmuller, an IBM vice
president for engineering technology solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. But until the advent of software that can
simulate assembly lines and the movements of the people who run
them, no one really knew a good way to gauge what they could
salvage from an older factory.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to software from companies like Tecnomatix
Technologies Inc. of Israel, Dassault Systemes of France, and Aspen
Technology in the United States, it is as feasible to design or
remodel an entire plant as it is to re-configure a car.
</P>
<P>
   Production engineers in industries as diverse as chemicals,
automobiles and aluminum smelting are manipulating virtual pictures
of their plants and processes to see whether moving a clamp or
adding a new ingredient will make existing equipment more
productive, or will enable the same assembly line to skip freely
from product to product. Some are even testing out a new virtual
reality program that enables engineers wearing special goggles to
detect problems by ``walking through and around'' a
three-dimensional model of their factory designs.
</P>
<P>
   The entire relationship between product design and production
engineering is being turned on its ear. No longer is it enough for
designers to create products that can be made and maintained
efficiently. Increasingly, management is asking them whether the
products can be manufactured with a minimum of retooling or work
stoppages _ and if not, whether it is worth giving up a particular
product feature in order to wring time and money from the
manufacturing routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This software is letting manufacturing influence design, not
just the other way around,'' said Steven A. Weiner, a Ford manager
of computer-aided analytical engineering.
</P>
<P>
   No one suggests that factory simulation software is a cure-all.
The programs can cost as much as $50,000 per engineer, when the
cost of dedicated hardware is counted. And the technology has the
same garbage-in-garbage-out problem that plagues all modeling
software.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, factory equipment works exactly as described by its
manufacturer. In truth, as robots and other machines age, their
movements become erratic. Then there is the tinkering that workers
often do to make a setup more efficient or comfortable _ rarely
entering such schematic changes into the data base. Such variables
can make computer models of a shop floor more approximate than
precise.
</P>
<P>
   ``A production line can look fine in a model, yet a robotic hand
might still have to jiggle a component to get it to align with
another piece,'' observed Emory Zimmers, director of Lehigh
University's computer-integrated manufacturing laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is little allure to the time-honored
alternative to computer modeling _ setting up an actual assembly
line and trouble-shooting it piece by piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too risky and expensive to try new tools or methods if
you have to build prototype hardware to test every change,'' said
Rani Agarwal Finstad, director of manufacturing math-based systems
for GM Powertrain, a manufacturer of car components that recently
used simulation software to squeeze a month out of the process of
programming robots to machine new crank shafts.

</P>
<P>
   The market for simulation software is growing, if slowly.
Bernard Charles, Dassault's president, figures companies spent $300
million globally for software that simulates manufacturing
facilities last year. That's nothing compared to the $4 billion he
believes industry spent on product design software, but ``there's a
growing understanding that computer simulations can replace
physical mockups of plants the same way they've replaced mockups of
products,'' Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, IBM agrees; it is marketing Dassault's factory
simulation software in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Robert G. Brown, president of Dassault's Deneb Robotics
subsidiary in Troy, Mich., says his sales are growing 25 percent a
year. (He won't break out numbers now, but Deneb had annual sales
of $22 million when Dassault bought it in 1997.) The Israeli
player, Tecnomatix, founded in 1983, muddled along with sales of
maybe $35 million a year until a couple of years ago. Last year its
revenues topped $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Testimonials to the factory modeling idea are easy to find.
``With simulation software, we can optimize plant designs before we
start to build,'' said Richard A. Leupen, group president of ICF
Kaiser's Engineers and Constructors Group.
</P>
<P>
   The engineers who design the automation systems sold by Rockwell
International have used simulation to design assembly lines that
can handle different sized items, enabling factories to
cost-effectively produce small batches of products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're headed to where modeling will let us design plants that
can efficiently build a single-lot size of one item,'' said Randall
L. Freeman, vice president of global marketing for Rockwell
Automation.
</P>
<P>
   Real-life examples of modeling's efficiency are mounting. Ford
says that one of its plants now uses the same assembly line to make
compact and mid-sized models. (Ford refuses to specify which cars
or where, citing competitive concerns.)
</P>
<P>
   Computer simulations of the tread-etching process has enabled
tire makers like Goodyear Tire and Rubber to switch production from
one type of tire to another in about an hour _ a process that
previously took an entire work shift. And simulations have shown
cookie companies like Nabisco how to use the same packaging
machines to make 5-pound bags for price clubs, 1-pound bags for
groceries and 6-cookie packs for vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   Various forces are driving the trend toward computer modeling.
For one thing, computer technology has finally caught up with
manufacturing pipe dreams. ``Only recently have computers been
powerful enough to quickly simulate what happens if you change
something in a chemical reactor,'' said David E. Waite, Dow's
manufacturing manager for information technology.
</P>
<P>
   Economic and marketplace forces are at work, too. Companies that
spent much of the 1990s paring ancillary product lines and work
forces are now trimming capital investment, lest shareholders think
they have lost their cost-cutting touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial community is unforgiving if you build a
billion-dollar plant and need another $200 million to change it
three years later,'' said Daniel Miklovic, a manufacturing
specialist at the Gartner Group, a research firm in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, meanwhile, have grown increasingly picky and expect
to be able to choose among myriad colors, sizes and shapes for
almost any product. That means that manufacturers must mix and
match parts as the orders come in. And that, in turn, means having
tools that can respond to electronic commands to switch paint
wells, move clamps, or change packaging and labels.
</P>
<P>
   Progressive Tool and Industries Co. in Southfield, Mich., a
designer of car assembly lines, recently used computer simulation
to replace fixed-position clamps on one manufacturer's line with
ones that move on slides; the clamps pivot out of one another's
way, and thus can be programmed to react when parts of different
sizes or shapes come down the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be awfully risky to try this without simulating it
first,'' said Donald A. Hemberg, Progressive Tool's general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Global competition is also playing a role, spurring
manufacturers to replace old products with newer versions at an
ever-more-rapid pace. ``When you're facing a product life cycle of
nanoseconds, you can't drive revenues just by lowering unit
costs,'' said David Burdick, a Gartner Group vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In some industries, even as new products arrive, older models
remain in production. Here, too, computer modeling can help.
</P>
<P>
   At Freightliner Corp., a truck maker in Portland, Ore., models
can overlap for four years because ``truckers are traditional, and
a lot of them still want the old looks,'' said Volker Mueller, a
Freightliner industrial engineer. But setting up assembly lines to
handle a new model even as they produce older ones can be a
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller says that Freightliner, which is about to introduce a
new medium-sized truck, has modeled its entire assembly plant on
Tecnomatix software. The truck maker is running what-if scenarios
that Mueller expects will reveal the best way to mix old and new
models on the existing lines, and to map out a painless method for
converting the lines to handle both.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the modeling procedure has led to development of a
conveyor belt that can sense what model is in production and
instruct robotic arms to pluck the right hood or other part from a
storage bin and have it ready to meet the truck chassis as it moves
down the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew our conveyor system was too slow, but the computer
helped us figure out why,'' Mueller said. He said Freightliner was
now using work-flow simulation to figure out how to keep trucks
moving evenly from worker to worker, when some models need more
handling than others _ putting 12 bolts into a wheel well, for
example, instead of four.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a worker lost time on a difficult truck, we want him to
make it up on an easy one,'' Mueller said. ``You don't want to wait
until the line is set up to find out you could have prevented
bottlenecks.

<P>
   Seeking new markets beyond its mainstay corporate data network
software, Novell Corp. plans Monday to announce an Internet
technology intended to give Web surfers greater control over their
identities as they travel through cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Novell hopes the technology, called Digital Me, will gain
acceptance as a standard means of controlling identity on the World
Wide Web, permitting network users to reveal or retain as much
personal information as they wish.
</P>
<P>
   At Novell's annual users group meeting Monday in Provo, Utah,
the company plans to demonstrate a simple personal computer version
of the Digital Me software, which acts as a digital safe-deposit
box for personal information _ not only name, address, credit card
numbers and such, but also possibly the telltale electronic codes
that can identify a person's PC and be used to trace his or her Web
travels.
</P>
<P>
   When an individual visits a Web site, the Digital Me software
would enable the user to control how much personal information the
Web site collects from this digital deposit box.
</P>
<P>
   Besides protecting privacy, such an approach might also make it
possible for users to sell or barter their personal data for
rebates, discounts or other special considerations from online
merchants. Digital Me also permits computer users to store and
exchange lists of information like Web site bookmarks or song
lists, work groups or groups of friends.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the announcement, Novell plans to say that the
financial services company Citigroup and the credit card provider
First USA will test new services based on the Digital Me software.
Those companies also intend to support Novell's effort to turn the
technology into an industry standard for online companies hoping to
reassure customers that personal digital information will not be
used in unauthorized ways.
</P>
<P>
   In tackling electronic privacy, Novell, which is still the
market leader in corporate network software but is feeling
increasing pressure from Microsoft Corp., has embraced one of the
Internet's lightning-rod issues.

   As the Internet has become increasingly commercialized,
companies have employed various electronic means to identify
computer users, track their movements over the Web and employ
so-called data mining techniques to create digital dossiers on
individual consumers. In response, privacy-rights and consumer
advocates have demanded that users be given more control over their
online identities and personal data.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a promising arena,'' said Marc Singer, co-author of
``Net Worth: Shaping Markets When Customers Make the Rules''
(Harvard Business School Press, 1999). ``The challenge for Novell
is finding the right business model. But the reason this can work
is there is value for both the consumer and the merchant.''
</P>
<P>
   Digital Me is the first significant new technology from the
company under Eric E. Schmidt, a former Sun Microsystems Inc.
executive who became Novell's chief executive in March 1997 and was
given the mandate of helping the office network software company
remain relevant in the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   The technology itself is the brainchild of Michael Sheridan, a
longtime software designer who was one of the three creators of
Sun's Java programming language. Last May, Sheridan left Sun to
join Schmidt at Novell as vice president involved in new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly, corporate Web sites are Hoovering virtually
everything you do on the Internet,'' Sheridan said, using industry
slang for the Hoover vacuum-cleaner approach that data miners often
take in gathering up all loose user information. ``They are talking
about `sticky' Web sites and `capturing eyeballs,' and I'm not sure
I like this language.''

   Although Internet commerce companies are increasingly reliant on
their ability to aim advertising at individual consumers, many Web
surfers are not aware of the extent to which computerized matching
technology is being used to keep tabs on them.
</P>
<P>
   Novell plans initially to release the Digital Me technology in
this year's third quarter in a form that would permit users to
establish multiple online identities _ perhaps one for work,
another for use with friends and a third for anonymous Web surfing.
</P>
<P>
   Identity, according to Schmidt, is the Internet's next frontier.
He cited an axiom set forth some years ago by the network innovator
and entrepreneur Robert Metcalfe, positing that the value of a
computer network can be expressed as the square of the number of
devices connected to it. ``Now we're in a new phase,'' Schmidt
said. ``Today, the value of the network is the square of the number
of human relationships on the networks.''
</P>
<P>
   While Novell plans to sell and license Digital Me products and
technology, the company has also decided to make the end-user, or
client, portion of the software freely available under so-called
open source terms, in the hope that other software developers will
expand the market for Digital Me by building compatibility into
software for e-mail, personal information management and Web
navigation.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's receptivity to Digital Me will be a crucial test
of Schmidt's ability to expand Novell's business beyond its
corporate networking niche, where its Netware flagship is under
fire from Microsoft's Windows NT and the coming Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the fiscal year before Schmidt arrived, Novell was
profitable, earning $126 million on sales of $1.3 billion. But even
then, sales of Netware were stagnant, and the company was widely
perceived as a once-innovative player that had failed to adapt to
the rise of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   After Schmidt oversaw several money-losing quarters of painful
revamping, Novell returned to profitability in 1998. And last
month, the company reported a fiscal first-quarter profit of $29
million, or 8 cents a diluted share, which was more than double its
earnings in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   There is a distinct sense of optimism at Novell's Provo campus
these days, where word of delays in Microsoft's Windows 2000
networking software has given the embattled company a sense of
reprieve. Certainly, Novell's share price has reflected Wall
Street's renewed optimism in the company. The stock, which closed
at $26.1875 last Friday, is up 44.5 percent this year. And the
company's overall market value now stands at $8.8 billion, compared
with barely $2 billion before Schmidt took over.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Me's 47-year-old godfather, Sheridan, holds only a vice
president's title. But as a member of Novell's eight-person
executive committee, he is clearly a part of Schmidt's brain trust.
</P>
<P>
   A 1974 graduate of Claremont College, where he studied economics
and Russian history, Sheridan was initially drawn to the world of
small publishing and became a protege of Grant Dahlstrom, whose
Castle Press was an exemplar of the small publisher devoted to
high-quality book printing.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan's work led to an interest in computerized typography.
And after growing close to two well-known Stanford University
computer scientists who specialized in the field, Chuck Bigelow and
Donald Knuth, Sheridan was accepted for graduate studies at
Stanford. Before he took his first course, though, he got
sidetracked by his first start-up company, Imagen, one of the
world's first laser printer companies, which was eventually sold.
Later, his second Silicon Valley start-up, a typography software
company, was bought by Sun Microsystems in 1988, and he went to
work there.
</P>
<P>
   After a number of development projects at Sun, where the main
product line is high-powered computer work stations, Sheridan
branched off with a development project for hand-held computers
that eventually led to the Sun Java programming language.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1993, long before Java reached the market, Sheridan had
tired of what he perceived as political infighting over the
project. He moved east to attend film school at American University
in Washington, and later made a PBS documentary, ``The Image of the
Spirit,'' about a group of Russian religious iconographers.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, though, Schmidt persuaded him to return to Sun, which
is based in Mountain View, Calif. Two years later, he followed
Schmidt to Provo.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan continues to make his home in Oak Hill, Va., but spends
most of his time in Provo supervising the small ``skunk works''
development laboratory that he has filled with people he has
selected from throughout the company.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the group's warren of offices was identified
only by a sign that read ``Documentation Center.''
</P>
<P>
   The sign now reads ``NPI: New Product Initiatives,'' as the
company has become more open about the Digital Me project and
another half-dozen projects in the pipeline _ or, to use Schmidt's
term, the Pipe. Most of those projects involve refinements to
network directories, the computer-system equivalent of telephone
books, which are a strength of Novell's Netware.
</P>
<P>
   More than a label, the Pipe is an incentive program for
soliciting innovative ideas from throughout the company and
fostering an entrepreneurial, risk-taking corporate culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem,'' Sheridan said in a recent interview, ``was, how
do you use Novell's collective brain?'' The answer: pay employees
$2,000 for any idea for a new Novell project that a small review
committee accepts.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the employee, who can come from anywhere in the
company, gets the opportunity to assemble a small team of people to
begin the process of transforming the idea into a product.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of Eric's mantras is that `It's OK to fail,''' Sheridan
said of the Pipe, which was set up five months ago.

HEARING EXPOSES CONCERNS ABOUT STOCK FRAUD ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (EDs: Filed in the ``w'' and ``f'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN   c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   WASHINGTON
_ Kristin Morris works for a small Virginia company that sells
computer equipment to the federal government and is familiar with
the Internet. Despite her background, Morris told a Senate panel
Monday that she fell victim to stock-fraud scheme over the
Internet.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet has provided a new tool for stock schemes and its
fast-moving technology is making the scams more widespread and
making it harder for state and federal authorities to keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that the Internet appears to provide
cybercrooks with ... avenues for committing financial fraud,'' said
Sen. Susan M. Collins, R-Maine, chairwoman of the Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations, which held a hearing on Internet
stock fraud issues.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, 34, said she was losing money on a utility stock she
owned and began surfing the Internet in 1997 in an attempt to find
a new stock that was less ``conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris said she ran across a site that listed small companies
that were about ready to issue stock through initial public
offerings, and was attracted to a California company that claimed
it was manufacturing new products that would allow people to use
their televisions rather than a computer to access the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Morris printed out the information about the company that was
provided on the Internet and said the description of the products,
like a special keyboard that would be hooked up to the television,
were very detailed. She then called a long-distance operator to
verify the phone number she was given on the Internet and called
the company to make sure it really existed. After talking to a
company official about the new products, Morris said she sent
$1,000 for shares of the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Morris never received a stock certificate, but several months
later she received a letter from the California Attorney General's
Office telling her that the company official was arrested for
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who has not recovered the $1,000, considers herself
lucky that the person who stole her money is now sitting in jail
because many people conducting stock-fraud schemes over the
Internet have yet to be caught.
</P>
<P>
   While federal and state law enforcement authorities have
recently established programs to combat Internet securities fraud,
the government's General Accounting Office said the rapid growth of
Internet stock scams ``could limit the ability of these programs to
protect investors.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the GAO, most securities fraud involves companies
offering stocks that trade at less than $5 per share and often
trade for $.50 or less _ so-called microcap or penny stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Many cases of securities fraud involve ``pump and dump'' schemes
where promoters push up a stock's price by making false claims
about the company, attracting new investors and raising the stock's
price. The con artists then sell their own shares to cash in on the
artificially high price, causing other investors to lose money
after the price falls. Such schemes were previously limited to
phone and mail solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gardner, the founder of The Motley Fool, an on-line firm
that provides investment advice, told the Senate panel that he
advises people to stay away from microcap and penny stocks. He said
about 75 percent of companies that issue stock at $5 or less
generally fail within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hillman, an associate director at the General Accounting
Office, said there are no comprehensive statistics available on the
incidence of securities fraud committed over the Internet but said
that federal and state securities officials call it ``an emerging
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also no firm statistics on how much money investors
have lost to Internet stock scams, but the GAO said, state
regulators have reported losses ranging from $18,000 to more than
$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   About 7.5 million Americans buy and sell stocks over the
Internet and that number is expected to grow to 18 million by 2002.
Most on-line investors use a reputable Internet brokerage service
to buy and sell stocks. Internet stock scams typically involve
stocks that are directly purchased by an investor.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission reports that it receives
about 200 to 300 electronic-mail complaints daily about potential
Internet fraud, up from 10 to 15 daily complaints in 1997. Since
1995 the agency has opened 66 investigations into Internet stock
fraud cases and has concluded 32 of them.
</P>
<P>
   While no legislation is pending to help state and federal
investigators combat Internet securities fraud, Collins said she
hoped the panel's hearings would be an effective means for
educating investors about the risks of buying unknown stocks over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said the panel would continue to
examine Internet fraud and could develop legislation that could,
for example, make it easier for authorities in one state to
investigate Internet fraud schemes that are conducted in other
states.

SOFTWARE MAKERS APPLAUD APPLE MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA   c.1999 San Francisco Examiner   SAN FRANCISCO _
The computer industry welcomed Apple Computer Inc.'s decision to
give away the software coding for its new Macintosh server
operating system.
<TEXT>
<P>
   By giving away the code for its new Mac OS X Server, Apple has
endorsed and entered a new era of software development, allowing
any programmer to improve upon and make new applications based on
the software.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's announcement by the Cupertino, Calif.-based company
means the Mac OS X ``kernel,'' or programming core, is available to
pretty much anyone through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should provide a quicker turnaround for developers,''
said Scott Seebass, chief executive of Berkeley-based Xinet Inc.,
which produces software programs for the printing industry. ``You
can develop (programs) without relying on the operating system
vendor to help you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mac OS X Server software costs $499, about half what Apple
had originally announced in January. The server and software
together cost $4,999, and are faster than systems running
Microsoft's Windows NT, Linux and Sun's Solaris brand of Unix.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of open source distribution of the software is to
encourage developers to make new software based on a core program.
In theory, when those software applications become popular, a
standard evolves that benefits the company, Apple in this case,
that created the core program.
</P>
<P>
   Open source programming has gained momentum recently due to the
growing popularity and acceptance of Linux, a free, Unix-based
operating system developed by Finnish student Linus Torvalds, that
is shaping up to be the only viable alternative to Microsoft's
dominant Windows NT operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Like Apple's Mac OS X, Linux is primarily used to run servers
and not individual computers.
</P>
<P>
   Publishing companies and educational institutions, the mainstay
of Apple's non-consumer business, should benefit most from the move
toward open source distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect a huge rush of people to convert (to the
Macintosh platform) but it will maintain Apple's dominance in
education and publishing,'' Seebass said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris LeToq, an analyst at San Jose, Calif.-based Dataquest
Inc., said Mac OS X Server ``supports what Apple is doing in these
marketplaces and really means that their customers don't have to
look elsewhere for server technology.''
</P>
<P>
   But experts were mixed on whether businesses using other
software platforms, namely Windows NT, will switch to Mac OS X.
</P>
<P>
   Seebass was optimistic about Apple's open source attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will attract the same people who are converting from NT to
Linux,'' he said. ``If you're working on NT, you have to rely on
Microsoft. (Apple) might convert some people who aren't happy with
their current options.''
</P>
<P>
   Lou Mazzucchelli, an analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison &AMP; Co. in
New York, said Apple probably would not gain many new business
customers immediately, but there could be more interest down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``The open source thing will promote cross-fertilization,'' he
said. ``The Linux guys who've been frustrated because there's no
Apple support (may convert). That's a potentially very big win for
Apple. But that's a longer-term thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Mazzucchelli said Apple needs to be very
careful in how it advertises and markets Mac OS X. Because the
product is targeted toward business customers, Apple shouldn't
advertise in general interest newspapers or magazines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really have to focus and not get their messages mixed,''
Mazzucchelli said. ``They don't want to confuse their consumer
customers.''

   Computer glitches are a pain, but they can be especially
embarrassing when they strike an American institution of higher
learning. Consider the following form letter from Arizona State
University, in which a prospective student's Social Security number
was inadvertently substituted for his name.
</P>
<P>
   The university says only a handful of such faulty letters were
mailed _ out of thousands sent out recently by the college's
parents association _ and the glitch has been corrected.
</P>
<P>
   One was enough, though, as the father's cheeky response below
attests. All the Social Security numbers have been fictionalized.

<P>
   Dear Parent or Guardian:
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations on 987-65-4321's admission to Arizona State
University! We commend you for the significant role that you have
played in helping him to prepare for this exciting and critically
important time. A.S.U. is committed to providing an outstanding
collegiate experience, and we are pleased that he has chosen to
take advantage of this tremendous opportunity. We are fully
prepared to assist 987-65-4321 in making a successful transition
from high school to college.
</P>
<P>
   We also recognize that even though your relationship with
987-65-4321 may change in the next few years, the importance of
that relationship will not diminish. At Arizona State University,
we value your continued participation in his academic, social and
personal development and actively seek your support in that
endeavor. Whether through involvement in the A.S.U. Parents
Association, attendance at numerous events for A.S.U. parents, or
the occasional visit to campus, you will be a partner with the
university in encouraging 987-65-4321 to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   We look forward to seeing you at an orientation program and
during A.S.U. Welcome Week prior to the start of the fall semester.
Information about these programs has been mailed to 987-65-4321.
Many of the activities during both events are designed specifically
for you. In the meantime, contact the A.S.U. Parent Programs office
. . . if you have any questions or concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>

<P>
   The father's reply:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Ms. Olson:
</P>
<P>
   Thank you for offering our son, 987-65-4321, or as we
affectionately refer to him around the house _ 987 _ a position in
the A.S.U. class of 2003. His mother, 123-45-6MOM and I are very
happy that such a prestigious institution of higher education such
as A.S.U. has extended this offer.
</P>
<P>
   In selecting a college for 987, we are looking for a place that
will prepare him for the technological challenges of the 21st
century. We seek a college in which he can learn to master
computers and learn to communicate with clarity and sensitivity. I
can only imagine the competence with which you will, as your letter
puts it so well, ``assist 987-65-4321 in making a successful
transition from high school to college.''
</P>
<P>
   We will miss 987 when he goes off to school, and are very
interested in a college in which he will receive personal
attention. I was particularly touched by your sentence in which you
note that our ``relationship with 987-65-4321 may change in the
next few years.'' This is certainly true. Already we are beginning
to focus as well on his brother, 123-45-6BRO.
</P>
<P>
   I look forward to additional communications from your office.
You manage to convey more in your letters that any other college we
have seen thus far. And believe me, we are still looking.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>
<P>
   123-45-6DAD
</P>
<P>
   A.k.a. Jeff Bradley
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bradley and 987-65-4321 are still waiting to hear from
Harvard, Yale and Dartmouth.

Unhappy over happy99.exe
</P>
<P>
   I received a lot of e-mail following last week's column on
happy99.exe, a type of worm or Trojan horse program that spreads
via e-mail. Infected systems send copies of happy99.exe with each
outgoing e-mail without the user's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Many readers said they had received copies of happy99.exe the
very morning the column appeared. I'm glad the information helped
stem the advance of this annoying program.
</P>
<P>
   A couple readers tipped me off to a file that happy99.exe
creates and that goes undetected by anti-virus programs. It's
called ``liste.ska.''
</P>
<P>
   The file isn't anything to be concerned about. In fact, it's the
only good file included in the whole happy99.exe mess.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the maker of happy99.exe decided it would be nice to
keep track of everyone sent a copy of happy99.exe from an infected
computer system. The list is kept in the file liste.ska.
</P>
<P>
   If you've had happy99.exe on your system, and didn't know about
this list, you've probably still got it bouncing around on your
hard drive. Conduct a file search, and you'll probably dig it up.
</P>
<P>
   You can open liste.ska using Notepad or any other
word-processing program you have installed on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Before deleting liste.ska, you might want to jot down the people
it lists (or print it out) and then send them an e-mail warning
that their computers might be infected with happy99.exe.

 `EDtv' PACKS LAUGHS AS SMALL SCREEN HITS SILVER SCREEN  
 (EDs: SUBS head, story stands.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of Hollywood's more inscrutable mysteries (beyond Keanu
Reeves' career) is its tendency to make two movies with the same
premise at about the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Two movies about computer-somatic bugs. Two movies about large
cosmic objects screaming Earthward. Two movies about the
dehumanizing agonies of American soldiers in World War II. Two
movies about randy Elizabethans (among them Joseph Fiennes) in
tights and ruffled collars.
</P>
<P>
   And now, two more: Ten months after the release of ``The Truman
Show,'' Peter Weir's breathtaking light-dark fantasy about a man
whose life is a television show, we have ``EDtv,'' a felicitously
wacked-out comedy about ... a man whose life is a television show.
</P>
<P>
   His name is, you guessed it, Ed, and he's a nobody who becomes a
somebody when he allows a camera crew to film his every move. Just
imagine the high jinks.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Ron Howard with ample fizz and sharply acted by a
delightful cast, the film is, in fact, so unlike ``The Truman
Show'' in tone and intent that it mostly stands on its own without
comparison. ``EDtv'' isn't profound, and it doesn't bang around the
brainpan with any particular resonance, but it does pack a lot of
big laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, quite a few are generated by Matthew
McConaughey he of the It Boy credentials, sputtering career and
borderline-unspellable name. McConaughey was fresh in ``Dazed and
Confused,'' sleek in ``A Time to Kill,'' presentable in
``Contact,'' appalling in ``Amistad'' and not all bad in ``The
Newton Boys.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``EDtv'' he's an explosion of slacker charm, an also-ran so
uncomplicated by ambition or cunning that he wins audience sympathy
just by cracking his grin. McConaughey has never been this
watchable; he's never been this much fun (although, as the
loser-lothario in ``Dazed,'' he came close).
</P>
<P>
   When we meet Ed, he's playing pool with his big-dreams brother,
Ray (Woody Harrelson, doing a mean twist on his old ``Cheers''
lunk), and sullen pal, John (Adam Goldberg). Ed's a 31-year-old
video store clerk whose metier is lugging beer in a cup-holder
strung around his neck. ``He's gonna spend the rest of his life
rearranging `Ernest' movies,'' gripes his brother.
</P>
<P>
   But when a cable network starts auditioning average joes for a
new, 16-hour-a-day, reality-based show, Ed catches a programmer's
eye he's cute enough to be telegenic, dense enough to act like an
idiot on national television. So they bring him into the network
offices, where a politburo of prickly executives grill him on
sundry topics. (What did he study in college? ``Study?'' he says.
``Jeeeeez, that would've been a big help.'')
</P>
<P>
   Included in this group are Rob Reiner as a pompous mogul and
Ellen Degeneres in distracted-non sequitur mode, wherein she
delivers some of the movie's more bizarro punch lines (``We don't
even have money in the budget for coffee filters. We use
yarmulkes''). Both put cheery bite into their dialogue, penned by
the same team of screenwriters (Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel) who
wrote Ron Howard's ``Parenthood'' and ``Splash.''
</P>
<P>
   But the heart of the film is McConaughey's sweet, dim Ed, a man
so eager to give up his privacy that he clips his toenails for the
camera. The wake-up scene on Day 1 is a vulgar beaut, and the bits
that follow are both smartly staged and stupidly funny; when Ed
drops a hot Pop-Tart (``Whoooo action sequence,'' says Reiner) and
bends to retrieve it, he checks out his rump on television. Dumb?
Sure. But you'll laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Ed sees the downside to this arrangement: It
alienates his brother, embarrasses his mom (Sally Kirkland),
confuses his ailing stepdad (Martin Landau, making great comic hay
of a weak heart), exposes him to fanatical hordes and gums up his
budding romance with Shari (touchingly played by Jenna Elfman of
``Dharma &AMP; Greg''). And as his celebrity grows, he begins to regret
it.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Truman Show,'' ``EDtv'' breaks up the narrative with
quick shots of television viewers gathered around the hearth. We
get the frat boys, the co-eds, the yuppie straight couple, the
yuppie gay couple, even ``the president'' all of them glued to Ed's
every soap-operatic development. This is cute for 15 minutes. By
minute 122 it gets to be a drag.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it the only thing that drags. Howard is a bright, kinetic
filmmaker, but he doesn't always know how to wrap things up; his
movies are just about equally divided between good stories with
obvious endings (``Apollo 13'') and good stories with lousy ones
(``Ransom''). ``EDtv'' is the latter sort.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, it brings Dennis Hopper into the plot, then shunts
him into oblivion after two criminally brief scenes. And the film
is packed to the eyebrows with so many talking-head cameos (Jay
Leno, Ru Paul, George Plimpton, Bill Maher) that the natural
impulse is to grab the remote and fling it at them. Unfortunately,
there is no remote.

`20 DATES' IS ALL ABOUT EGO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``20 Dates'' is about a moron _ oxy and otherwise. A neurotic
jerk of a struggling actor looking for true love in Hollywood. It's
a documentary meant to be the personal journey soul-searching kind,
akin to Ross McEwee's ``Sherman's March.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Myles Berkowitz doesn't appear to have a soul, just an ego
that fails to grasp why women don't love him.
</P>
<P>
   In a fit of frustration with his single, thirtysomething
lifestyle, Berkowitz embarks on a mission to find the truth about
himself by going out on 20 dates with 20 different women. Whether
filmmaking is cheaper than just going to see an actual therapist is
up in the air, but what therapist would allow a guy as irritating
as Berkowitz to whine-and-dine her?
</P>
<P>
   It helps to consider ``20 Dates'' as Woody Allen's ``Private
Parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz amply deprecates himself so as to deflect the
possibility that you might find him annoying. He's basically saying
``I already know I'm irritating.'' So why stoop to the level of
desperate self-sploitation that Berkowitz does? What part of
``You're a jerk, buddy'' doesn't he understand?
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the crumb of this movie's charm: He just wants to
be loved. Is that so wrong? Well, when you're showing up to blind
dates with a cameraman and a sound guy, something's wrong. Many of
the women filmed don't seem to take to Berkowitz's self-promoting
in the first place, then a few notice the camera lens poking out
from behind palm fronds in a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz includes footage of him being hit by angry women, of
his ex-wife telling him why their marriage broke up. But things get
downright bizarre as Berkowitz actually falls for Elizabeth, one of
the middle dates.
</P>
<P>
   She reciprocates as he's forced to continue to fill the date
quota by the film's unseen but heard Russian producer named Ilie,
who insists the director film dates with only ``hot'' women.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth actually grows distraught as the Myles Berkowitz show
goes on. She should be able to see that at times Berkowitz doesn't
really want a girlfriend, he wants a star on the Hollywood Walk of
Fame.

HELP! WE'RE ACCUSED OF A HACK ATTACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Recently our server kicked us off, accusing us
of ``hacking activities of a serious nature.'' My son told us about
Back Orifice and how this was the cause of our problem. I was
wondering if: (A) this was possible, (B) this was probable, (C) I
can let my son out of the closet now, and (D) I should enlarge the
closet to accommodate his geeky friend.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sleepless in New Hampshire
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SLEEPLESS: At least you didn't opt for summary execution,
which probably would have been my first choice. Back Orifice is
nothing for a kid to be playing with, so naturally your kid has
been playing with it.
</P>
<P>
   There are some nimrods calling themselves ``The Cult of the Dead
Cow'' who have developed a ``remote-administration'' tool, called
``Back Orifice.'' Please don't confuse them with some nimrods
calling themselves ``Microsoft'' who have developed ``Web
site-administration'' tools called ``BackOffice.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in this instance, ``remote administration'' means
rummaging around your computer, messing with your files and finding
all your pictures of Nikki Cox. Sure, it may be a fine line between
teen pornography and art, but do you really want somebody making
that decision for you?
</P>
<P>
   BO has to be installed covertly on your computer first, but
that's no problem. It can be sent to you as an e-mail attachment.
You know all those cute videos and sound clips that wind up in your
mailbox? Each is a potential BO carrier. You should never click on
them if you don't know what they are, but who remembers caution
when you get something named Nakedpix.exe?
</P>
<P>
   BO is sneaky. You can't normally tell if it's running. Go to
www.bardon.com/boelimdl.htm and get a free BO-removal utility. If
you don't trust that download, there are instructions for getting
rid of BO manually.
</P>
<P>
   And don't leave your kid in the closet with that geek too long.
I guess you've seen enough prison movies to know what I mean.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have a Power Macintosh with the good old
serial port, and I am thinking of getting a universal serial bus
card so I can use iMac accessories. Is it true that PCs will
someday be USB-compatible?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ports of Call
</P>
<P>
   DEAR CALL: Where have you been? Didn't you see Bill Gates make a
jerk out of himself at a Win98 demo when he plugged a USB scanner
into his PC and crashed it? I wonder where the guy who set up the
demo is working these days. Taco Bell? Jack-in-the-Box? There are
just so many opportunities for somebody with his background.
</P>
<P>
   USB is the latest ``standard'' port for hooking up your
peripherals. You plug something into a USB connector, the operating
system will recognize it and you'll be back to work in no time,
unless you're Bill Gates standing in front of hundreds of people
laughing themselves silly.
</P>
<P>
   PCs have supported USB since the waning days of Win95. You had
to download the drivers and probably add hardware to your PC, but
with enough patience and cocktails, you could get it to work as
advertised. Win98 has the support built in. It should make hooking
up new peripherals fairly painless, at least until the next
standard comes along. I hear Bill's looking for volunteers to set
up the demo. Any takers?
</P>
<P>
   (When noted computerologist Dr. Emilio Bombay plugs something
in, it works, except for that time his house burned down. He can be

HAVANA NEIGHBORHOOD OFFERS INSIGHTS ON FATHER
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
Editor's note: Baseball columnist Pedro Gomez, a first-generation
Cu ban-American, describes his impres sions of his parents'
homeland. He is in Havana for Sunday's historic exhibition game
between the Balti more Orioles and the Cuban Na tional Team. &HT;     By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
HAVANA _ The same man who pleaded with my parents to stay in Cuba
has lost his hair and his two-day old beard is white. His mind and
body, however, are sur prisingly strong and he looks no where near
his 84 years.
<P>
   For so many years, Rodolfo Fernandez-Guzman has been a face less
person to me. All I knew of the ``old man'' was that he tried in
vain to keep my parents from fleeing Cuba in 1962, shortly after
commu nism was sweeping through the island.
</P>
<P>
   This is the man my mother and paternal grandmother, Trinidad, ar
gued with almost daily. This is the man who told my mother that by
the time I reached kindergarten the world would be dominated by com
munists.
</P>
<P>
   I met Guzman on Thursday when I made my way to the El Vedado
neighborhood of Havana where my father lived until the day he and
my mother left for the United States in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely I remember going back and forth with your mother
and Trini,'' Guzman said. ``All I said was that the child inside
your mother might grow up to be a great scientist, a ballplayer, a
good com munist, or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that the child should be able to decide for itself. Now
look at you, you're a grown man with a family of your own. I can't
believe you were the one inside her belly. The world gives us so
many differ ent turns, sometimes it works for some and not for
others. For you, it seems to have worked fine. But who knows where
you would be if you had been born here?''
</P>
<P>
   Like every Cuban I have encoun tered during my first visit to my
parents' homeland, Guzman went out of his way to be gracious and
generous. He was open, with his ideology and his home, offering
food and drinks.
</P>
<P>
   The map my father drew for me two weeks ago served as a perfect
guide to reach his old home, which looked identical to what he
remem bered from 36 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   After taking the jam-packed M6 bus line south on Avenue 23
toward El Vedado, I exited at 24th Street and set off on a short
walk filled with intrigue and mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Just before reaching the Almen dares River, there was 32nd
Street. One block to the right was Pasaje A. And then I was there,
at the only home my father knew until he fled to Miami with my
mother, who delivered me three weeks later in the U.S. The current
tenant, Vilma Varela-Alfonso, has lived in the same home for 29
years.
</P>
<P>
   The home is 65 years old and has housed exactly two families: My
father's and now Alfonso's. Consid ering how transient Americans
are, it's mind-boggling to consider that only two families have
lived in the same home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this home,'' Alfonso said. ``I've spent my entire life
here. I will never leave here. It's a very comfortable home. It's
very private and quiet. This is where I want to finish my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso is 32. She was kind enough to offer a tour of my
father's boyhood home. Once inside I saw the exact bed where my
father slept and, as Guzman pointed out, where I was
``fabricated,'' the room where my parents lived during their final
year in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right there, they made you,'' Guzman said. ``So in a way,
you've actually been here before.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking up to No. 13 on Pasaje A, I felt a strong sense of
pride. Meeting the people of the neighbor hood, at least the ones
who were here when my father still lived here, was like an
out-of-body experience.
</P>
<P>
   First there was Asuncion de la Cruz and her son, Abilio
Valdez-de la Cruz, who vividly recalled playing chess with my
father while growing up. Asuncion informed me of a crush my father
had on her daughter, Magalis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooph,'' de la Cruz said, ``Your father used to chase my
daughter around the neighborhood all the time. I know he had a
thing for her.''
</P>
<P>
   From there I met Ofelia Gonza lez-Pargo, whose husband owned a
grocery store on the same block before it was nationalized by the
government in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   She nearly started crying when she discovered I was Trini's
grand son.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an amazing coinci dence,'' she said. ``I swear on my
mother's grave I was talking about Trini (Wednesday) night. I was
talking about my son's baptism and how we had a little party. I
started talking about all the guests we had and I brought up
Trini's name. I can't believe this. They are sad memories of
glorious times.''
</P>
<P>
   Trini was born in Madrid. At 4-foot-8 and stocky, she resembled
a tough little sparkplug, unwilling to take anything from anyone.
She was known as La Gallega, a common name Cubans have for all
Spaniards. Her reputation in the neighborhood was well known.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel de la Cruz was then a rambunctious 7-year-old and used to
play doorbell ditch at my grand mother's home, the game where you
ring a doorbell and run away before the occupant opens the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew she had a short temper,'' de la Cruz said. ``We
all knew we could get her going. Then she would stand on the porch
cursing at all of us. They were just things children do.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood remains tight-knit. All are friendly and all
take care of one another. The core of the neighborhood is exactly
as my father described it, strong and friendly.
</P>
<P>
   I now have a little better sense of my father and everything
that shaped his life. Not surprisingly, I see the same qualities in
him to this day. &QL;

BANK ROBBERS ARE AMONG THE DUMBEST OF CRIMINALS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DANIEL VASQUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget the Hollywood images of robbers like ``Baby Face'' Nelson
or John Dillinger fleeing banks with sacks of easy cash. Police
call it one of the stupidest crimes, something even some criminals
admit.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the crime must be pulled off in broad daylight, on
banker's hours. There are cameras to avoid, as well as bait money,
dye packs, silent alarms, and the strong possiblity a police
officer will arrive soon. In fact, in Boston, police usually
respond to a bank alarm in less than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an easy crime to pull off, but nearly impossible to get
away with,'' said a local detective who specializes in
investigating bank robberies. ``Think about it. How many crimes
leave police with a photograph of the criminal? Even if you wear a
mask, you're leaving behind physical evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But still banks get robbed: at least once a week in Boston,
police say. In fact, in the last four weeks, female robbers _ an
unusual breed _ have struck eight banks in the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many bank robbers are druggies who are desperate and looking
for fast money,'' said Harvey Burstein, a former FBI agent who is
now a professor at Northeastern University. ``Then you have the
gamblers, folks who think they can beat the system. There is always
the hope for a big score.''
</P>
<P>
   The average haul, $1,500 in Boston, is not enough to buy a good
used car. And seven of 10 bank robbers get caught, facing at least
six to 10 years in prison, one investigator estimated.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, police arraigned a woman who authorities believe to
be the mastermind of seven of the armed bank robberies in the past
month. Beverly DeAngelo, 33, of Peabody, was arrested on unrelated
drug charges but allegedly was tracked by FBI agents working from
bank surveillance photos and anonymous tips.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a woman who police believe is a copycat bandit
robbed a bank in the North End, the same branch hit by the original
female robber.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, some bank robbers were legends, like Willie Sutton,
who once said he robbed banks because ``that's where the money
is.'' Before deposits in banks were insured, a stickup at a bank
could wipe out a small community.
</P>
<P>
   But authorities say that most bank robbers today are low-tech
criminals. The organized bank robber _ one who uses multiple
partners, police scanners, walkie-talkies, masks with fake wigs,
high-powered weaponry, and several getaway cars _ is rare, but a
concern for police.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts alone, there have been a number of bank
robberies in which thieves have walked out with between $100,000
and $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But crime history books are filled with attempted bank robberies
gone horribly awry.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 23, 1970, was one of Boston's darkest days. Walter A.
Schroeder, a 42-year-old Boston officer, was shot and killed when
he responded to a silent bank alarm at the State Street Bank and
Trust in Brighton. All the bandits who pulled off the $26,000
robbery have been brought to justice, including Katherine Ann
Power, who was a fugitive for 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to bank robberies, we will always remember
Walter Schroeder,'' said Sergeant Detective Margot Hill, Boston
police spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``His death proves a bank robbery call is always dangerous,''
Hill said. ``We get a lot of false alarms, but we train officers to
assume every one is real and dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Police say that is why the gamble is so risky for bank robbers,
whether they carry a weapon or not. Officers are trained to respond
quickly and silently, using deadly force when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 7, 1983, for example, two gunmen ordered 15 customers to
the floor of a Back Bay bank, robbed tellers of $14,000 in cash,
and were about to escape when they encountered Officers Daniel
Haggerty and Steven Chin.
</P>
<P>
   One of the gunmen opened fire, the other tried to shoot but his
gun jammed. When it was over, a robber was dead, and the other was
in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Boston's FBI task force, who spoke last week, said
the female bandit who robbed Boston area banks was getting between
$2,000 and $4,000 per job. Her success made her unusual, they said.
</P>
<P>
   But after her last robbery on March 17, one investigator made a
prediction: ``She'll mess up soon.''
</P>
<P>
   DeAngelo was arrested a few days later.

THERE'S NO GOOD REASON MRS. CLINTON WOULD WANT TO BE SENATOR
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This week's status report on the New York Senate
race:
</P>
<P>
   Hillary was in Egypt; Rudy was on the ropes. While the first
lady who's thinking of becoming second senator in New York took
Chelsea to look at pyramids, Mayor Rudy Giuliani was looking for a
way out of the escalating political crisis over the police.
</P>
<P>
   The hands-on hard-guy approach that made the onetime prosecutor
the darling of voters has become a liability. Hizzonah is fumbling
for the reins after losing control of the issue. Suddenly the
800-pound gorilla of New York City looks like just another monkey
in the urban political zoo.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats beg her to run, citing favorable polls, a
bottomless war chest, promises to make nice, all the blandishments
for which lesser candidates would kill. My hunch? She won't do it.
</P>
<P>
   Not out of fear of losing. No one married to Bill Clinton,
having survived impeachment, possible indictment, the massed armies
of big tobacco, big pharmaceuticals, big insurance, and the big
wind of the Republican Congress, who has outlasted Ken Starr,
Monica Lewinsky, and the collective hostility of the news media, is
going to be frightened of losing a lousy Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does she get if she wins?'' posed a New York Democratic
activist who's helped wage two statewide campaigns. ``Six years of
doing constituent service?'' Erie County needs more snowplows,
ma'am. The Long Island Expressway needs 85 new bridges. We need to
dredge the Hudson all the way to Canada. Oh, and there are 300
angry black people sitting in at the office, and the Yankees are
threatening to move to Ontario if you don't get Steinbrenner a tax
break.
</P>
<P>
   This is winning? Plus having Rupert Murdoch's New York Post
serve you up a bucket of insult every morning with your bagel? Six
years of tabloid ordeal-by-ordure? Yes, the idea of getting to zing
Trent Lott every weekday afternoon is sorely tempting. But why
settle down to plowing the same furrows year after year when the
whole world beckons?
</P>
<P>
   My suspicions about the attractiveness of the Senate to a woman
like Mrs. Clinton were only reinforced by a dinner Wednesday night
at Harvard's Kennedy School. Former Republican Senator Al Simpson
of Wyoming pointed out that he and a fellow guest, former
Democratic Senator David Pryor of Arkansas, had arrived and left
the Senate at the same time and during 18 years had managed to have
some fun. That made me think of all the senators who have quit the
World's Greatest Deliberative Body:
</P>
<P>
   George Mitchell and Bill Cohen of Maine, Warren Rudman of New
Hampshire, Bill Bradley of New Jersey, John Danforth of Missouri,
and Howard Baker of Tennessee and Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, who
got married to each other instead of the job. Twelve of the 100
quit in '95 alone, indicating that being in the Senate is not the
dream job outsiders think. C-Span and cable network chat shops make
us more familiar with senators remote from our home states _ and
it's scary to see some of these goofs in action, let's be frank.
</P>
<P>
   So my bet is that Hillary thinks twice: decides that the race is
winnable, that the money and support are there, that Giuliani is
beatable _ but that at the end of the day, she just doesn't want to
be nailed to a Senate seat for six years answering roll calls on
inane measures. Every vote she missed, the New York Post would fang
her. Bottom line? Not worth winning.
</P>
<P>
   Win she would, in my view. Giuliani, who's taking his Big Apple
polishing act on the road as a vice presidential auditionee, is now
facing a mandatory 180 on police brutality, veering off his
cops-can-do-no-wrong stance to something softer and gentler. The 41
police bullets aimed at an unarmed black man by overeager cops left
him dead but Giuliani wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Even pro-cop Cardinal John O'Connor spoke out boldly Sunday in
his homily to 1,000 police officers attending Mass at St. Patrick's
Cathedral. ``If there have been insensitive injustices against
black people, against Latin and against Asian people, it would do
no good to deny these injustices.''
</P>
<P>
   Said the state's top prelate: ``As long as the perceptions are
there, they must be dealt with. It is rare that perceptions have no
foundation.'' Confession must precede absolution, said O'Connor.
``If there have been injustices, we must take appropriate steps to
resolve these injustices.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulletin to the mayor: Notice that the cardinal told the cops
``we,'' not ``you.'' That's the part Giuliani doesn't get. Governor
George Pataki says the mayor should try listening more. Ed Koch,
the former mayor, says Rudy doesn't get it yet. The blacks,
Hispanics, civil libertarians, and editorial writers tried, too.
But Mr. Tough Guy, the prosecutor-turned-pol, has a tin ear. In a
Keystone Kops move, Police Commissioner Howard Safir planned to
blow off a City Council hearing on police conduct, to fly to
Hollywood for the Oscars. Hammered in the tabloids as ``Hollywood
Howard,'' Safir rushed home for a public flogging before hostile
city councilors.
</P>
<P>
   If Hillary looks through the New York papers to bone up on
Rudy's troubles, she might just conclude, like thousands of others
nixing a career move to New York: ``Who needs this?''

WHEN CD STOOD FOR CIVIL DEFENSE, STAR WARS MADE MORE SENSE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you thought CD was shorthand for savings, Sinatra, or
software. It feels more like the days when ``CD'' was that Civil
Defense sign in the school basement and that ominous storage room
with barrels of water and crackers. You wonder if President Clinton
is about to resume air raid drills, with children being ordered to
the basement to get on their knees, tuck their heads, and cover the
backs of their necks (as if that really stops falling bricks).
</P>
<P>
   Such is the wailing in Washington, where Clinton and Congress
are about to spend at least another $10.5 billion over the next six
years to produce a missile defense system that would destroy enemy
projectiles only seconds after they left the ground. Despite our
unrivaled nuclear stockpile, we have scared ourselves back into
yesteryear over so-called ``rogue'' states in Asia and the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are affirming that there is a threat, and the threat is
growing, and that it will pose a danger not only to our troops
overseas but also to Americans here at home,'' said Defense
Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska said, ``There's a real danger of
proliferation that produces either an accidental launching or an
attack by a rogue nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Porter Goss of Florida, the chairman of the House
Intelligence Committee, said: ``The threat is real. It is growing
and more immediate than many have thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Congress have already shown their hand that they
have given the new version of ``Star Wars'' no real thought.
Clinton is so bent on keeping the Republicans from hammering the
Democrats on defense during the upcoming presidential campaign that
he has pledged to announce a decision on deploying a missile
defense in June 2000 _ four months before the election _ even
though it will be impossible to know by then if it can work.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly no one in the Pentagon itself is betting that such a
system will be available anytime soon. They are happy to have the
money, but they must be taking it like someone who counts the
change at the grocery store and sees that the cashier has handed
them a $10 bill instead of a one.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Henry Shelton, said
last month in Sea Power magazine that he and the Joint Chiefs have
been so skeptical about ``Star Wars'' that ``we have been portrayed
on occasion as being anti-national missile defense. We are not! The
simple fact is that we do not yet have the technology to field a
national missile defense. We have, in fact, put some $40 billion
into the program over the last 10 years. But  &UR; today &LR;  we do not
technologically have a bullet that can hit a bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton said that when such a system becomes feasible he will be
happy to deploy it, but until then, the United States has to show
patience. ``There are other serious threats out there in addition
to that posed by ballistic missiles,'' he said. ``We know, for
example, that there are many adversaries with chemical and
biological weapons that can attack the United States  &UR; today &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``They could do it with a briefcase _ by infiltrating our
territory across our shores and through our airports. So the chiefs
question putting additional billions of taxpayers' dollars into
fielding a system that does not work or has not proven itself _ and
we do not think that one round hitting one missile is proof
positive that we should start fielding.''
</P>
<P>
   For a Capitol Hill that puts politics before patience and for
the sectors of the military that will delight in the dollars,
hitting one missile is a cause for delirium. Two days before the
Senate's 97-3 vote to field a missile defense system, the Army
successfully hit a test target over New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Saying there was a lot of hugging and cheering, the Army's chief
of missile defense programs, Brigadier General Daniel Montgomery,
said: ``The significance of this success can't be overstated. This
certainly moves us well down the road of saying we can make these
systems work.''
</P>
<P>
   Well down the road? This sounds more like low standards.
Depending on who you believe, the military has hit a grand total of
two targets in 15 tries or four targets in 18 tries since ``Star
Wars'' was conceived by President Reagan in 1983. Put another way,
this means that this program, which has cost taxpayers between $55
billion and $68 billion, is still likely to miss eight or nine
times out of every 10 attacks.
</P>
<P>
   This is such a boondoggle that other members of the Joint Chiefs
have echoed Shelton. Testifying about a missile defense system last
fall before the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Army chief of
staff, Dennisa Reimer, said: ``I think we need to have something
that's practical, that has a degree of success. I think it has to
be balanced against the other priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill there is no balance, no patience. Missile
defense is nothing but a political bomb lobbed by the Republicans
at the Democrats. The Democrats, instead of calling for an air raid
drill for all of us to hear, are on their knees with their heads
tucked down, writing blank checks for clueless programs. Lockheed
Martin, Boeing, Raytheon, and the like are popping the champagne.
They know that after the billions are spent, they will be lucky if
they produce anything worth any more than a Civil Defense barrel of
water and crackers.

AN IMPORTANT LESSON IN LOVING THY NEIGHBOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, I introduced my daughters to racism.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't the sort of thing you hope your children will
encounter, but as African-Americans, they are likely to experience
it sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   And so I wanted them to see the kind of up-close and personal
discrimination that patrons are exposed to at the new ``Face to
Face'' exhibit, which opened last month at The Science Place in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Aimed at children ages 7 to 12, the exhibit explores
stereotyping, name-calling and exclusion through interactive videos
and role-playing exercises.
</P>
<P>
   As Jamila and Asha scurried through the various stations, I took
particular note of the ``Talk Back Board,'' filled with handwritten
testimonials from visitors.
</P>
<P>
   There were literally hundreds of responses, mostly from
school-age kids. They had one overriding theme: ``Treat others the
way you want to be treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading those comments and listening to my daughters' reactions,
I was reminded of a conversation about racism and growing up in
Mississippi that I had with the Rev. Laurie Feille recently at
University Christian Church in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of our talk, a woman in the audience asked me how we
might overcome the race issue. I told her that I believed the only
way we will ever get past it is for all of us to love our neighbors
as ourselves. I told her that if we can't find it in ourselves to
do that, we're are in for a rude awakening. All the time we spend
in church pews and doing ``good'' things will have been for naught.
</P>
<P>
   At the ``Face to Face'' exhibit, I wondered whether this might
be an affirmation of my comments. I wondered how in the world we
could still be wrestling with such a question when the answer seems
so clear, even to little children.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to this, from a child named Rachel: ``It's horrible to
see the judgment people show toward each other. What you must do is
love your neighbor as yourself no matter how hard it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   And this, scribbled by Alexis Perez: ``I am a popular girl
sometimes, but there is a girl that does not like me. But even
though she doesn't like me I try to be sweet to her. I hope you do
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Face to Face'' opened last month and will run through May 30
before moving on to nine other cities this year. No one who is
still trying to come to terms with race and other differences, or
who has been hurt by discrimination, should miss it.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does it expose prejudice for what it is, it offers
tools to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   But as one student wrote, ``Many people live in denial of their
racist attitudes. This is why we still have SO many problems in
this country. This is no illusion. It is real!! Wake up, America,
before it's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   I was deeply moved by these notes _ moved by the wisdom found in
such a simple truth: Treat others the way you want to be treated.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, this seems idealistic and unobtainable. But it is
no more idealistic than it is to believe that attitudes about race
have changed along with laws.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't. Not all of them.
</P>
<P>
   And so I was moved by the wisdom in our children's words because
I believe, like them, that when we exercise love and forgiveness,
we promote healing.
</P>
<P>
   When asked which is the first commandment of all, Jesus said:
``And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with
all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength:
this is the first commandment. And the second is like unto, namely
this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that no facet of human personality _ affection,
intellect or will _ is left untouched by love?

 &HT;    Easter table settings can be high-end or budget savvy
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For Martha Stewart wannabes, the table setting is
almost as important as the food.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers, china and stemware set the mood and style of the
occasion _ transforming even the most ordinary dinner into an
unforgettable experience for guests.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to create that party perfect table for Easter, which
is April 4, turn it into a pastel fantasy. Use the pretty shades of
traditionally dyed eggs _ lemon yellow, lavender, pale green and
apricot _ to create a fashionable, tasteful look.
</P>
<P>
   Easter has always been Atlanta interior designer Bill Cook's
favorite holiday. ``It celebrates spring,'' he says. ``And you have
all the wonderful shades of the new season with which to work.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect to see rabbits hopping around his table.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to get too thematic with the bunny thing,'' says
Cook. ``I prefer to decorate with the egg, the ancient symbol of
new life. Jelly beans or chocolate eggs are whimsical and witty and
can be used with traditional or contemporary china.''
</P>
<P>
   As a challenge, we asked Cook to set two contemporary Easter
tables _ an inexpensive look and a pricier version. Although we
used everything new for our settings, you might want to include
nostalgic family favorites on your table.
</P>
<P>
   TARGET:
</P>
<P>
   ELEGANTLY INEXPENSIVE
</P>
<P>
   For this setting, Cook found sleek plastic dinnerware at Target,
which included oval plates, square platters and oversize latte
cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be afraid of mixing colors,'' he says, as he happily
combined shades of lemon, pale green, apricot and lavender in a
place setting. Clear tumblers, accented with stripes, flowers and
dots in the same colors, carried through the theme, as did the
place mats. Other touches: colorful cloth napkins, look-alike ivory
flatware, jelly beans and a wheat grass centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Cook also chose architect Michael Graves' stainless steel napkin
holder (below) with egg-shaped salt and pepper shakers as well as
his streamlined ice bucket, with oval handles (above).
</P>
<P>
   COST BREAKDOWN
</P>
<P>
   From Target stores: Soup bowl, $2.69; small bowl, $1.99; oval
salad plate, $2.49; dinner plate, $2.69; large striped or polka-dot
tumbler, $2.69; small tumbler, $2.49; latte cup, $2.49; 12-piece

<P>
   Getting ready for passover can be a daunting task, but the
annual spring festival is a joyous celebration of freedom
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Oy vey! Passover is coming, and time is short for
Debbie Deutsch, who works by day running a preschool and by night
chasing kids and cooking. And Tuesday she'll have to find time _
somehow _ to scour her house to rid it of every single crumb and
kernel of hametz.
</P>
<P>
   What's hametz?
</P>
<P>
   Anything made with grain _ such as wheat, rye, barley, oats,
beer, liquor, pasta, cookies, cakes, rice, dried peas and beans _
all forbidden to Jews during Passover, which begins with an
hours-long feast called a Seder on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, she'll clean the oven, run the dishwasher _ empty _
a few times to make it kosher for Passover, remove everyday dishes,
put down new shelf paper, replace the plates and silverware
normally used with ones reserved for Passover, and draft her whole
family into the ritual.
</P>
<P>
   The forbidden foods contain leaven, the stuff that makes bread
rise, and during Passover is seen as a symbol of slavery, a
reminder of the Exodus from Egypt some 3,400 years ago. According
to the Torah, the Jewish name for the first five books of what
Christians call the Old Testament, the Israelites fled in such
haste they had no time to bake bread. So they took the dough and
baked it in the hot desert sun into hard, flat crackers called
matzo.
</P>
<P>
   For at least 1,800 years, matzo has been seen not only as a
reminder of oppression, but also of redemption, freedo a feeling of
control, and they can be very comforting. People find it reassuring
to be able to return to the same kinds of rituals, time after time.
It helps bring people and communities closer together. ``
</P>
<P>
   And this, says Dr. Stuart Vyse of Connecticut College, reduces
stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``These rituals create a tie to the past and to the religious
group,'' he say. ``They create a sense of belonging that everyone
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Plotkin says leaven also symbolizes ``inflated ego,'' so getting
rid of hametz is like cleansing the soul.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a choice we make,'' she says. ``It makes us feel whole.''

`SIMPSONS' CREATOR GROENING FORWARDS TO `FUTURAMA'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use Sunday, March 28 by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The future looks familiar in ``Futurama,'' the new
animated series debuting tonight on Fox. No doubt, that's because
it's from Matt Groening, the man behind ``The Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Futurama'' begins on Dec. 31, 1999, when Fry (Billy West), a
down-and-out pizza delivery boy, accidentally falls into a
cryochamber and freezes while making a delivery to Applied
Cryogenics (``No power failures since 1997'').
</P>
<P>
   Fry stays frozen for 1,000 years while we watch out a window as
civilization is destroyed twice and then rebuilt. Awakened on Dec.
31, 2999, Fry is thrilled, seeing it as a chance to escape his
loser life, but a one-eyed alien woman, Leela (Katey Sagal), who is
the Fate Assignment Officer, tells him that the only job he is
suitable for is delivery boy. Since his new fate is looking a lot
like his former life, Fry flees when Leela tries to imprint him
with a permanent career chip.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly loses himself in 30th-century New York City, where
the motto is ``You gotta do what you gotta do.'' Throughout the
city are odd remnants of the past such as an Angelyne billboard
(isn't that an L.A. thing?). He then hooks up with a suicidal robot
named Bender (John DiMaggio) before ducking into the Head Museum to
hide from Leela and the authorities. There he is greeted by the
head of Leonard Nimoy, who can't do the Vulcan thing anymore since
he doesn't have hands. If you're quick, you'll see heads of Gillian
Anderson, David Duchovny, Dennis Rodman, Liz Taylor, Ms. Streisand
with Barbra misspelled as Barbara and Mr. Groening himself. Later
New Year's Rockin' Eve 3000 is introduced by the head of Dick
Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Fry, Bender and Leela eventually find themselves on the same
side and join craggy Professor Hubert Farnsworth, Fry's lone living
relative, on a voyage into space, where they will, presumably,
encounter weirder aliens than the ones here on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The animation on ``Futurama'' is a bit jazzier than ``The
Simpsons,'' but with the same bug-eyed faces. Judging by the first
episode, the writing isn't as sharp, though. Apart from the concept
of being trapped in the same future you were trapped in 1,000 years
before, most of the satirical targets are fairly obvious. Given
Groening's successful track record, you would have expected that he
try for something bolder _ both in animation and in concept.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, ``Futurama'' shares Fry's dilemma: It's caught in the
same old rut. But Groening has built up enough cachet that viewers
might want to stick around in ``Futurama'' long enough to give it a
chance. &QL;

<P>
   FINLEY, Wash. - As battles go in the deadly war with the E. coli
bacteria, what happened last October in this dusty little town
would seem a minor skirmish.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve children got sick but no one died. Although state
officials are convinced meat in a school lunch caused the outbreak,
the source was never conclusively determined, and the supplier
denies any fault. Today, five months later, the E. coli 0157:H7
outbreak is remembered much like a bad summer storm that briefly
threatened and then passed on.
</P>
<P>
   But a Cox Newspapers investigation found that Finley's toxic
lunch reveals the risk children face because of the way the U.S.
Department of Agriculture runs the country's school lunch program.
The USDA, which donated the ground beef for Finley's tacos, bought
the meat from a plant with a history of E. coli contamination and
repeated serious food safety violations because it was the low
bidder.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's outrageous. Safety violators shouldn't be allowed to
participate in the lunch program,'' said Nancy Donley, president of
Safe Tables Our Priority (S.T.O.P.), a citizen's group long
concerned with E. coli issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The USDA should be putting them out of business, `` said
Donley, whose six-year-old son died in 1993 of E. coli poisoning,
``not helping them stay in business.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley's problems began on Oct. 6, 1998, when the school served
a taco lunch to the children at Finley Elementary school. Within
days at least 12 children became violently ill from E. coli. When
the condition of four of the children worsened, they were
transferred to Seattle's Children's Hospital for blood transfusions
and, in one case, kidney dialysis.
</P>
<P>
   As doctors worked to save the lives of the 12 children,
investigators tried to track down the source of the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic testing showed that all the children were infected when
they ate the same food. The most likely source of the infection was
the ground beef in the tacos, even though health officials said
they did not find E. coli in the leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   Northern States Beef Co., which produced the ground beef, cites
the negative tests as proof it was not the source of the outbreak.
But health officials say such seemingly contradictory findings are
not unusual because E. coli contamination is often restricted to
one small portion of ground beef. Where and how much of a sample
one takes can determine if the pathogen is found.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said it was more significant that, when they
examined the leftover taco meat, they found that some of the ground
beef was undercooked. Heat-sensitive E. coli bacteria would only be
able to survive and infect the children if the meat were improperly
cooked. They also said that, with one exception, the illness was
restricted to children who ate the school lunch. The exception, a
two-year-old who lives in the neighborhood, is thought to have been
infected through contact with one of the school children.
</P>
<P>
   What the townspeople in Finley never knew _ because federal
officials never told them _ was that in the 18 months prior to the
government purchase the Agriculture Department's own inspectors
found 171 ``critical'' violations of U.S. food safety regulations
at the Northern States Beef plant.
</P>
<P>
   A ``critical'' violation is defined by the Agriculture
Department as a plant condition that is ``certain'' to cause
contamination of food, which is ``certain'' to reach consumers, and
is ``certain to have a detrimental effect upon the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal records show inspectors cited the plant repeatedly for
the same kinds of violations. For example, the plant amassed 64
critical violations in 1996 for the failure of its pre-operational
sanitation procedures such as properly cleaning equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to food safety violations, federal officials linked
the Northern State's plant to an April 1994 E. coli outbreak that
sickened at least 18 people in Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern States Beef plant had more violations than most
other plants of its size in 1996, the last year for which complete
records are available. By comparison, a plant in Nebraska operated
by Hudson Foods _ with 90 critical violations in 1996 _ was forced
to halt production in 1997 after it had the largest recall of E.
coli tainted ground beef in the history of the meat inspection
program.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Northern States' track record, government records show
the Agriculture Department purchased over 20 million pounds of beef
from the plant as part of its commodities program.
</P>
<P>
   According to federal law, the track record for Northern States
Beef should have been taken into account before the government
purchased meat from the plant. The law establishing the School
Lunch Program orders the Agriculture Secretary to ``establish
procedures'' to ensure the wholesomeness of food bought for school
lunches.
</P>
<P>
   The law goes on to say that ``...contracts for the purchase of
commodities shall not be entered into unless previous history and
current patterns of the contracting party with respect to
compliance with applicable meat inspection laws... are taken into
account.''
</P>
<P>
   USDA spokesman Andy Solomon said that food graders are in each
plant as meat is being prepared for the school lunch program.
Although he said these officials do not test for E. coli, they do
test for spoilage, which Solomon said indicates in a general way
the cleanliness of a plant.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon added that the government did take one sample for E.
coli at the Northern States plant in 1997, 1998, and 1999 and all
three samples were negative. By contrast, the Jack-In-The-Box
hamburger chain does E. coli testing every 15 minutes at plants
that supply it.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Shanholtzer, a spokesman for the USDA's Food and
Nutrition Service, which distributes the commodities, said his
agency does not check the safety of meat used in the school lunch
programs. ``FSIS (Food Safety and Inspection Service) is USDA's
meat and poultry safety agency. They work for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was FSIS inspectors who detailed the problems at the Northern
States Beef plant in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Phares, a spokesperson for ConAgra, which owns Northern
States Beef, said there is no proof that meat from that plant
played any role in the Finley outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Government) tests were negative,'' said Phares, ``So it's
perplexing to us that they (Washington State health officials)
would say this.''
</P>
<P>
   She also termed her company's role in the 1994 E. coli outbreak
as ``inconclusive.'' While she acknowledged the tainted ground beef
came from the Northern States plant, she said some of the meat used
to make the ground beef came from other plants.
</P>
<P>
   Local health officials in Washington state are unanimous that
the school lunch caused the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rational thought leads you to the taco meat,'' said Dr. Larry
D. Jecha, the district health officer for the Benton-Franklin
Health District. He said county health officials found evidence of
undercooked ground beef _ a common source of infection _ in the
taco meat, all but one of the children ate the meal, and the
genetic signature of the pathogen that infected everyone was
identical.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials like David Gifford agree. ``The logical
conclusion was that it was the meat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Phillip Tarr, a Seattle-based expert in E. coli outbreaks,
summed up the Finley evidence, saying, ``Absence of proof does not
mean proof of absence.''
</P>
<P>
   While health officials in Washington state said all meat should
be considered dangerous and cooked thoroughly, they said that does
not excuse federal officials from trying to provide meat that is
wholesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The higher the risk the more care should be taken,'' argues
Bruce Perkins, a county health official. ``Maybe the better way (to
provide meat for school lunch programs) is to see who has the best
inspection records and buy from those people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department buys large quantities of beef and
pork through its commodities program for two reasons. One goal is
to support food prices when the market has gone soft, and the
second is to supply schools, soup kitchens and other social service
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the USDA spent more than $219 million buying more than
209 million pounds of frozen and canned meats. Most of the meat is
given to schools nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked,'' said Alan Almquist, father of one of the
children sickened in the outbreak, when told about the USDA role.
``It's like the government is approving of this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize I was sending my child into a danger zone,'''
added Almquist's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Almquist's son was one of four children who had to be
transferred to Seattle Children's Hospital over 200 miles away as
their condition worsened. ``I can't tell you how close my son came
to dying,'' Almquist said.
</P>
<P>
   The parents' dismay was echoed by Robert Van Slyke, the
superintendent of the Finley schools. He said he was ``outraged''
by the USDA's silence.
</P>
<P>
   Van Slyke said federal officials had a responsibility to tell
him about the source of the beef before the school cafeteria
workers used it and, after the outbreak, to disclose what they
knew. ``It was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they knew (about the violations) and didn't say, how far
can we go in trusting what they say now. ``

<P>
   FINLEY, Wash. - As battles go in the deadly war with the E. coli
bacteria, what happened last October in this dusty little town
would seem a minor skirmish.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve children got sick but no one died. Although state
officials are convinced meat in a school lunch caused the outbreak,
the source was never conclusively determined, and the supplier
denies any fault. Today, five months later, the E. coli 0157:H7
outbreak is remembered much like a bad summer storm that briefly
threatened and then passed on.
</P>
<P>
   But a Cox Newspapers investigation found that Finley's toxic
lunch reveals the risk children face because of the way the U.S.
Department of Agriculture runs the country's school lunch program.
The USDA, which donated the ground beef for Finley's tacos, bought
the meat from a plant with a history of E. coli contamination and
repeated serious food safety violations because it was the low
bidder.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's outrageous. Safety violators shouldn't be allowed to
participate in the lunch program,'' said Nancy Donley, president of
Safe Tables Our Priority (S.T.O.P.), a citizen's group long
concerned with E. coli issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The USDA should be putting them out of business, `` said
Donley, whose six-year-old son died in 1993 of E. coli poisoning,
``not helping them stay in business.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley's problems began on Oct. 6, 1998, when the school served
a taco lunch to the children at Finley Elementary school. Within
days at least 12 children became violently ill from E. coli. When
the condition of four of the children worsened, they were
transferred to Seattle's Children's Hospital for blood transfusions
and, in one case, kidney dialysis.
</P>
<P>
   As doctors worked to save the lives of the 12 children,
investigators tried to track down the source of the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic testing showed that all the children were infected when
they ate the same food. The most likely source of the infection was
the ground beef in the tacos, even though health officials said
they did not find E. coli in the leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   Northern States Beef Co., which produced the ground beef, cites
the negative tests as proof it was not the source of the outbreak.
But health officials say such seemingly contradictory findings are
not unusual because E. coli contamination is often restricted to
one small portion of ground beef. Where and how much of a sample
one takes can determine if the pathogen is found.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said it was more significant that, when they
examined the leftover taco meat, they found that some of the ground
beef was undercooked. Heat-sensitive E. coli bacteria would only be
able to survive and infect the children if the meat were improperly
cooked. They also said that, with one exception, the illness was
restricted to children who ate the school lunch. The exception, a
two-year-old who lives in the neighborhood, is thought to have been
infected through contact with one of the school children.
</P>
<P>
   What the townspeople in Finley never knew _ because federal
officials never told them _ was that in the 18 months prior to the
government purchase the Agriculture Department's own inspectors
found 171 ``critical'' violations of U.S. food safety regulations
at the Northern States Beef plant.
</P>
<P>
   A ``critical'' violation is defined by the Agriculture
Department as a plant condition that is ``certain'' to cause
contamination of food, which is ``certain'' to reach consumers, and
is ``certain to have a detrimental effect upon the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal records show inspectors cited the plant repeatedly for
the same kinds of violations. For example, the plant amassed 64
critical violations in 1996 for the failure of its pre-operational
sanitation procedures such as properly cleaning equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to food safety violations, federal officials linked
the Northern State's plant to an April 1994 E. coli outbreak that
sickened at least 18 people in Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern States Beef plant had more violations than most
other plants of its size in 1996, the last year for which complete
records are available. By comparison, a plant in Nebraska operated
by Hudson Foods _ with 90 critical violations in 1996 _ was forced
to halt production in 1997 after it had the largest recall of E.
coli tainted ground beef in the history of the meat inspection
program.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Northern States' track record, government records show
the Agriculture Department purchased over 20 million pounds of beef
from the plant as part of its commodities program.
</P>
<P>
   According to federal law, the track record for Northern States
Beef should have been taken into account before the government
purchased meat from the plant. The law establishing the School
Lunch Program orders the Agriculture Secretary to ``establish
procedures'' to ensure the wholesomeness of food bought for school
lunches.
</P>
<P>
   The law goes on to say that ``...contracts for the purchase of
commodities shall not be entered into unless previous history and
current patterns of the contracting party with respect to
compliance with applicable meat inspection laws... are taken into
account.''
</P>
<P>
   USDA spokesman Andy Solomon said that food graders are in each
plant as meat is being prepared for the school lunch program.
Although he said these officials do not test for E. coli, they do
test for spoilage, which Solomon said indicates in a general way
the cleanliness of a plant.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon added that the government did take one sample for E.
coli at the Northern States plant in 1997, 1998, and 1999 and all
three samples were negative. By contrast, the Jack-In-The-Box
hamburger chain does E. coli testing every 15 minutes at plants
that supply it.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Shanholtzer, a spokesman for the USDA's Food and
Nutrition Service, which distributes the commodities, said his
agency does not check the safety of meat used in the school lunch
programs. ``FSIS (Food Safety and Inspection Service) is USDA's
meat and poultry safety agency. They work for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was FSIS inspectors who detailed the problems at the Northern
States Beef plant in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Phares, a spokesperson for ConAgra, which owns Northern
States Beef, said there is no proof that meat from that plant
played any role in the Finley outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Government) tests were negative,'' said Phares, ``So it's
perplexing to us that they (Washington State health officials)
would say this.''
</P>
<P>
   She also termed her company's role in the 1994 E. coli outbreak
as ``inconclusive.'' While she acknowledged the tainted ground beef
came from the Northern States plant, she said some of the meat used
to make the ground beef came from other plants.
</P>
<P>
   Local health officials in Washington state are unanimous that
the school lunch caused the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rational thought leads you to the taco meat,'' said Dr. Larry
D. Jecha, the district health officer for the Benton-Franklin
Health District. He said county health officials found evidence of
undercooked ground beef _ a common source of infection _ in the
taco meat, all but one of the children ate the meal, and the
genetic signature of the pathogen that infected everyone was
identical.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials like David Gifford agree. ``The logical
conclusion was that it was the meat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Phillip Tarr, a Seattle-based expert in E. coli outbreaks,
summed up the Finley evidence, saying, ``Absence of proof does not
mean proof of absence.''
</P>
<P>
   While health officials in Washington state said all meat should
be considered dangerous and cooked thoroughly, they said that does
not excuse federal officials from trying to provide meat that is
wholesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The higher the risk the more care should be taken,'' argues
Bruce Perkins, a county health official. ``Maybe the better way (to
provide meat for school lunch programs) is to see who has the best
inspection records and buy from those people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department buys large quantities of beef and
pork through its commodities program for two reasons. One goal is
to support food prices when the market has gone soft, and the
second is to supply schools, soup kitchens and other social service
organizations.
</P>
<P>

WRITER EXPLORES THE STORY OF THE ANDREW CUNANAN MANHUNT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, March 29)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Vanity Fair story that Maureen Orth had
researched for two months about Andrew Cunanan's cross-country
killing spree was ready for typesetting when word came that Cunanan
was the chief suspect in the July 1997 killing of international
designer Gianni Versace on the steps of his South Beach mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Orth hurried to Florida for additional reporting and added the
necessary coda. At that point, Cunanan was still at large, and the
mystery of whom he was and why he killed was growing along with one
of the largest manhunts in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Cunanan had killed four people in three states over the course
of 13 days. ``We were in the final fact-checking process,'' says
Orth, an intense brunette with a brilliant smile and a steel-trap
mind. ``We were juggling and cutting and adding, and then we had to
open the story up a third time when they found Cunanan's body. That
issue went to press later than any in Vanity Fair history.''
</P>
<P>
   The story has become a book, Orth's first, called ``Vulgar
Favors: Andrew Cunanan, Gianni Versace and the Largest Failed
Manhunt in U.S. History'' (Delacorte Press). The book and film
rights were sold by hotshot literary agent Amanda ``Binky'' Urban
even before the magazine hit the newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of nine months, Orth interviewed as many as 500
people, some of them twice. One of them was San Francisco socialite
Harry de Wildt. Six of Orth's sources went on record to say they
had seen de Wildt in a limousine with Versace and Cunanan when the
designer was in San Francisco, preparing the costumes for the San
Francisco Opera's production of ``Capriccio.''
</P>
<P>
   De Wildt has always denied that he knew Cunanan. ``Andrew was a
great aspirer,'' says Orth, ``and he was fascinated with de Wildt,
whom I called for my Vanity Fair article. He told me that Andrew
was a `nobody' who was probably fascinated with the idea of him and
Gordon Getty.''
</P>
<P>
   Why then, if people saw them together with Versace after meeting
at Colossus, a massive weekend gay dance party, did de Wildt deny
meeting Cunanan? Orth can only surmise that ``he didn't want to be
the conduit for this connection.''
</P>
<P>
   For 19 months, Orth immersed herself in the sad, sordid life of
the half-Sicilian, half-Filipino man. Cunanan, says Orth, ``never
lived in reality. He was spoiled and so materialistic that he
realized the only way he could get everything he wanted was to sell
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   With Cunanan, who never told the same story about himself twice,
``the center didn't hold,'' Orth continues. ``He was a pastiche and
a narcissist and in the end, the only thing that counted was image.
He became so frustrated and enraged; he wanted to be famous so
badly. Finally, he would have to kill to be recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Orth's first book _ as she puts it, at the age of
``50ish,'' she has finally written the big book. ``My mother said
to me after reading something written by some rock star, `Maureen,
what's the matter with you? Any damn fool can write a book.'''
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody sinks their teeth into their subject matter
like Maureen Orth, who worries her subjects to death with extensive
research.
</P>
<P>
   As a reporter for Newsweek, Orth had eight cover stories in five
years, including Bob Dylan's comeback, Bruce Springsteen and
Francis Ford Coppola. Her work has always been edgy and fluent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She didn't start out to be a writer. Orth graduated from the
television documentary program at the University of California at
Los Angeles. A political science major who had spent two years in
the Peace Corps in Colombia, she was hired by the CBS affiliate in
Sacramento and then promptly fired when management decided it
couldn't have more than one woman on the anchor team.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1970. To keep body and soul together, she moved back to
the San Francisco area and wrote public relations releases for
friends, including a group of lawyers who had just bought a
warehouse full of MGM effluvia.
</P>
<P>
   The memorabilia had come to the attention of Hal Silverman,
editor of the San Francisco Examiner's former Sunday magazine,
California Living.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hal wanted to know who these people were,'' Orth says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were dope lawyers _ Hal asked me to write about them,
about the counterculture. I'd never written anything in my life. I
met this man at a party who was carrying a briefcase. In it, he
said, was the sixth draft of his book. He asked to see the notes
for my story, and he underlined everything that should be used as a
quote, and together we cut and pasted the article together.''
</P>
<P>
   The helpful Samaritan? Alex Haley, who was carrying around the
final draft of ``Roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Her second story for Silverman was about Jesus freaks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the dope lawyer story had been picked up by New York
magazine writer Nick Pileggi. ``He felt so bad about stealing my
story that he turned the Village Voice onto me.'' In less than
three years, Orth was working for Newsweek in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she married a consultant for NBC named Tim Russert
who is now moderator for ``Meet the Press.'' They have a son named
Luke who is 13.

 NATO AIR STRIKES: DANGEROUS and COUNTERPRODUCTIVE

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The decision of the United States and its NATO allies to strike
Yugoslavia is a very dangerous step fraught with unpredictable
consequences not only for Europe but for the whole world. Let us
call a spade a spade; it's an aggression.
 &HT;    War has effectively been declared on a sovereign state going
through an internal conflict. The behavior of the Yugoslav
government in the conflict and in the talks aimed at settling it
deserves, at the very least, severe criticism.
 &HT;    But the fact remains: NATO's military action is a blatant
violation of international law. The U.N. Charter permits such
action only in self-defense or with authority from the U.N.
Security Council. Neither was present.
 &HT;    What the Western alliance led by the United States is in effect
saying is that might is right and it wants a monopoly position in
the world power system. Clearly, a ``victory complex'' is at work
here, born of the heady conviction that the West won the Cold War.
But in international affairs, superiority complexes can be at least
as dangerous as inferiority complexes. ``Acting with resolve''
should imply a great sense of responsibility and vision.
 &HT;    Western negotiators in the talks on Kosovo settlement told us
again and again that without the threat of force the talks would go
nowhere. It is now clear that the threat was counterproductive.
Instead of recognizing the failure of that course and persevering
in a search for compromise, NATO is compounding the mistake. We are
now being told that bombs and cruise missiles will help to
``prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo'' _ an argument that
is nothing but thinly veiled hypocrisy.
 &HT;    The use of force always points to a fiasco of policy and
policy-makers. Even when, in early 1991, there was legal
justification for the use of force against Iraq, I insisted on the
use of all political means and stressed that the military operation
could be avoided. Today, we see that Western politicians are making
a habit of using force. But is it not clear that this has not made
the world more secure?
 &HT;    It is amazing how quickly the United States and NATO have fallen
into a double standard in assessing internal conflicts and ways of
solving them. I won't cite the all-too-familiar examples where such
conflicts _ and even some governments' waging war on their own
people _ caused but a mild rebuke from the United States. Was it
alliance ties that influenced the response, or perhaps fear of
becoming involved in a conflict fraught with the risk of major
American casualties?
 &HT;    There are dozens of conflicts and crises, raging or latent, in
the world today. Should air strikes and military operations be used
to deal with all those conflicts? What would be the outcome of
that? Could it be another Cold War?
 &HT;    I urge Western policy-makers to give thought to these questions.
I endorse Russia's firm stand against the use of force. True,
Russia is no longer a superpower, but that kind of strength is not
the only factor that makes for strong policies.
 &HT;    Yevgeni Primakov's decision to cancel his visit to Washington
was dramatic and probably difficult to take, but I believe it was
right under the circumstances. For the West, it would be another
mistake to try to ``punish'' Russia for this position of principle.
I think that acting in this way, Russia is defending not just its
own interests.
 &HT;    There is still room for a political solution to the conflict.
Every opportunity should be used. A way has to be found out of a
situation brought about by wrongheaded policies. The problem must
be examined by the U.N. Security Council, and a negotiating
mechanism should be recreated.
 &HT;    I call upon the Yugoslav government to accept the political part
of the agreement worked out in Paris and to discuss a mechanism for
its implementation that would involve the participation of the
international community. Russia could play a major constructive
role in this process, whose resumption is indispensable if we are
not to slip into another Cold War.

here, born of the heady conviction that the West won the Cold War.
But in international affairs, superiority complexes can be at least
as dangerous as inferiority complexes. ``Acting with resolve''
should imply a great sense of responsibility and vision.
 &HT;    Western negotiators in the talks on Kosovo settlement told us
again and again that without the threat of force the talks would go
nowhere. It is now clear that the threat was counterproductive.
Instead of recognizing the failure of that course and persevering
in a search for compromise, NATO is compounding the mistake. We are
now being told that bombs and cruise missiles will help to
``prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo'' _ an argument that
is nothing but thinly veiled hypocrisy.
 &HT;    The use of force always points to a fiasco of policy and
policy-makers. Even when, in early 1991, there was legal
justification for the use of force against Iraq, I insisted on the
use of all political means and stressed that the military operation
could be avoided. Today, we see that Western politicians are making
a habit of using force. But is it not clear that this has not made
the world more secure?
 &HT;    It is amazing how quickly the United States and NATO have fallen
into a double standard in assessing internal conflicts and ways of
solving them. I won't cite the all-too-familiar examples where such
conflicts _ and even some governments' waging war on their own
people _ caused but a mild rebuke from the United States. Was it
alliance ties that influenced the response, or perhaps fear of
becoming involved in a conflict fraught with the risk of major
American casualties?
 &HT;    There are dozens of conflicts and crises, raging or latent, in
the world today. Should air strikes and military operations be used
to deal with all those conflicts? What would be the outcome of
that? Could it be another Cold War?
 &HT;    I urge Western policy-makers to give thought to these questions.
I endorse Russia's firm stand against the use of force. True,
Russia is no longer a superpower, but that kind of strength is not
the only factor that makes for strong policies.
 &HT;    Yevgeni Primakov's decision to cancel his visit to Washington
was dramatic and probably difficult to take, but I believe it was
right under the circumstances. For the West, it would be another
mistake to try to ``punish'' Russia for this position of principle.
I think that acting in this way, Russia is defending not just its
own interests.
 &HT;    There is still room for a political solution to the conflict.
Every opportunity should be used. A way has to be found out of a
situation brought about by wrongheaded policies. The problem must
be examined by the U.N. Security Council, and a negotiating
mechanism should be recreated.
 &HT;    I call upon the Yugoslav government to accept the political part
of the agreement worked out in Paris and to discuss a mechanism for
its implementation that would involve the participation of the
international community. Russia could play a major constructive
role in this process, whose resumption is indispensable if we are
not to slip into another Cold War.

SHAKEUP IN AUTO DEALERSHIPS HITS MASSACHUSETTS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORWOOD, Mass. _ Ernie Boch, whose ``Come on down'' tagline
helped make him a legend on the Route 1 auto mile, is very clear
about what is at the core of his car-selling philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll beat anyone on the showroom floor,'' says the 72-year-old
salesman. ``I believe 100 percent in free trade. You survive on
your own. You don't need any protection.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an industry where car manufacturers and giant chains are
putting the squeeze on independent dealers, most of Boch's
colleagues in Massachusetts don't agree with him. They say they
need more protection in dealing with the likes of Ford, General
Motors, and Toyota, not to mention big regional players like Boch,
who in addition to owning four dealerships is the exclusive New
England distributor for Subaru.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of dealer discontent are everywhere, and Boch is a
prime target. Seven current and former Subaru dealers have sued
Boch in federal court, alleging a pattern of harassment designed to
force them to take cars with expensive unwanted accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Clair Honda in West Roxbury is in court trying to stop Boch from
opening a new Honda dealership 4 miles away in Norwood. And the
state association of auto dealers is pushing legislation that not
only would give them more leverage in their dealings with
manufacturers but also force Boch to divest either his Subaru
distributorship or his Toyota, Oldsmobile, Mitsubishi, and Kia
dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   Given that both sides of this issue are populated with
salespeople, it's not surprising that all the players claim to have
the interests of the car-buying public at heart.
</P>
<P>
   Boch, who has hired a lobbyist and is attacking the dealer
campaign head-on, says the lawsuits and the legislation seek to
stifle him and competition, which will result in higher prices for
car buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition works. It flushes everything out,'' said Boch, who
says he outsold all other Toyota, Mitsubishi, and Oldsmobile
dealers in the region last year. Adding in the Subarus he sold to
dealers, he moved 31,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's legislative sponsor, Senator Stephen F. Lynch, a
South Boston Democrat, says car manufacturers and ``chosen
dealers'' like Boch want to do to the automobile business what Home
Depot has done to the hardware store business _ eliminate mom and
pop stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It smacks of anticompetitiveness,'' Lynch said. ``It's better
for the people I represent to have this competiton and have these
dealers out in the neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate in Massachusetts is just starting to heat up, but
it's already boiling in other parts of the country. After years of
taking a hands-off attitude toward dealers, manufacturers over the
last four years have tried to gain more control over how dealers
operate.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is buying stakes in dealerships in Oklahoma, Texas, and a
handful of other states. GM is taking control of advertising funds
it once allotted to local dealerships. And chains such as CarMax
and AutoNation are gobbling up dealerships. Industry analysts say
the goal is to reduce costs and increase profits by operating
fewer, larger dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is unmistakable. Last year, the National Automobile
Dealers Association said Americans bought 15.5 million cars from
22,400 dealers, 200 less than the year before. Forty percent of the
sales were made by dealers with multiple facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real upheaval going on in the retail landscape
right now,'' said Jack Madden, owner of Jack Madden Ford in Norwood
and the president of the Massachusetts Auto Dealers Association.
``A lot of dealers who have been in the business for years are
feeling threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill being pushed by Madden's organization would update
dealer protections in three major ways:
</P>
<P>
   --Protected areas. If a manufacturer decides to open or relocate
a dealership, a dealer selling the same brand within a 15-mile
radius of the proposed location would have standing to try to block
it. The actual area is larger, since it includes any town touched
by the 15-mile circle. Protests are more restricted under existing
law.
</P>
<P>
   --Automatic stays. Any dealer challenging a manufacturer's
decision to cancel his franchise, move it, or place a competing
dealership nearby could automatically stay the action by filing a
protest with a seven-member state board, of which three members
would be auto dealers. The onus of proving the action was warranted
would be on the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   --Dealer discipline. Manufacturers would have far less
flexibility in disciplining dealers for sales and service
violations or fraud on warranty work. Warranty work reviews would
be limited to one year, instead of the three years allowed under
current law. Any dealer accused of warranty fraud could stay any
disciplinary action by appealing to the state board.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the provisions in the bill address complaints made in
the Subaru suit against Boch. A common denominator of the bill and
the lawsuit is Richard Kalika, the owner of Wakefield Subaru.
Kalika, a plaintiff in the lawsuit and the head of the dealer
committee that drafted the legislation, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   One provision in the legislation would bar manufacturers or
distributors like Boch from owning any dealerships in the state.
Some people familiar with the drafting say Boch was targeted, but
Lynch says that is not the intent of his bill.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Curhan, legal counsel to the state dealers association, is
emphatic that the bill is not an attack on Boch. He says consumers
will be well-served if the bill passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately,'' he said, ``it means the forces of the market
determine who stays in business, not a marketing committee in
Detroit.''

 By BRENDAN M. CASE, with additional reporting by Latin Trade staff 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Scooting about his office among three computers, typing at a
speed faster than most people are capable of thinking, Miguel de
Icaza is nearly oblivious to anything but his bold plan to reclaim
the software industry from corporate giants. At his day job, the
25-year-old oversees the computer network at a Mexico City research
institute. But by night, De Icaza coordinates a small band of
guerrilla programmers over the Internet in a global struggle
against Microsoft's dominance of the products that make computers
run.
 &HT;    Using a powerful computer system favored by the technically
savvy, De Icaza and his team have created rivals to the popular
Microsoft Windows and Office programs. They are volunteers, in the
spirit of collaboration that ruled the Internet in its early days.
Their product, called Gnome (pronounced guh-NOME), is free to
anyone who wants to download the software.
 &HT;    What sounds like a Lilliputian effort has come to be recognized
as the biggest threat to the profits of the mighty software
industry, including its largest, wealthiest member, Microsoft.
Working together worldwide via the Internet, software aficionados
have long created products for fun and charity as well as to solve
important problems. Whether born from a hatred of one corporation's
control of the desktop or an esthetic urge to write beautiful code,
De Icaza's hobby is now putting him at the front of a growing band
of Internet-connected techies that aim to kill the giant.
 &HT;    De Icaza has already won his first battle: Authorities at
Mexico's Public Education Ministry have chosen Gnome software over
the standard Microsoft package for the landmark Scholar Net program
to bring 1 million Internet-connected computers into schools.
Microsoft executives feel the heat: ``We have meetings every week
with the top management of Scholar Net,'' says Microsoft's
Alejandro Flores, who claims that his company has an agreement to
provide the ministry with Windows software. ``If they want to
negotiate price, we're willing to do so to get our product in,'' he
says, at any price. ``Maybe even for free.''
 &HT;    Even for free, De Icaza can compete. The main weapon in his
Gnome arsenal is Linux (rhymes with `cynics'), a program that
controls the basic functions of a computer. The collaborative
achievement of the renowned MIT programmer Richard Stallman, a
Finnish programmer named Linus Torvalds and thousands of others
around the world, the complex software is a prime example of what
is known as open-source software. Such programs carry no
copyrights. In fact, they carry ``copylefts,'' an industry term
meaning anyone with a hankering to tinker withand perhaps
improvetheir underlying command codes may do so. The only condition
is that users must pass along their improvements to others.
 &HT;    Proponents of the open-source movement say that as a result of
massive collaboration, their programs are more stable and just
plain better than similar proprietary software. For cash-strapped
organizations, open-source products have another major perk: They
are free.
 &HT;    The Windows serfs are most concerned about the Linux brand of
free software. ``Linux is growing very fast, much faster than other
open-source products,'' says Microsoft's Flores. ``Microsoft is
working to develop a strategy against that.''
 &HT;    While largely unknown outside of computing circles, Linux
already has millions of high-tech users and powers huge corporate
networks and Internet servers around the globe. Computer geeks and
network administrators admire the software for its power and the
fact that they can tinker with the source code to tweak the system
to their individual needs. Internet service providers favor the
operating system for all that, but they especially love it because
anything that comes for free is a godsend in that tight-margin
business. Strong ties to the Internet technical crowd have also
guaranteed that Linux programs are widely available for downloading
around the world, a major distribution advantage.
 &HT;    But what Linux had long lacked were useful programs for ordinary
people. Not so long ago, all personal computer users faced the same
problem. Then in the mid-1980s, first Apple's Macintosh, and then
Microsoft Windows revolutionized desktop computing with easy-to-use
applications that did not require the use of special command
language. The point-and-click method allowed users to operate a
computer without having to understand what went on inside the
machine. ``Most people just want a computer to do something useful
for them,'' says Dan Kusnetzky, an analyst at International Data
Corp.
 &HT;    De Icaza began using Linux as an 18-year-old computer-science
student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. He came
across a German project called KDE, which attempted to create a
Linux system that worked similar to Windows. But after trying it,
De Icaza came away frustrated. He complained to friends about its
shortcomings. Instead of sharing his sorrow, they goaded him on,
saying why don't you do something about it'
 &HT;    So he did.
 &HT;    Within a few days, he had arranged a small team of programmers
to develop their own group of useful tools for Linux. A week later,
they had posted their first lines of source code on the Internet
and tagged their project as Gnome, which stands for GNU Network
Object Model Environment. ``The first programs didn't do anything,'
De Icaza says, ``but they showed people we were serious and that
generated a lot of interest.''
 &HT;    The state of controlled chaos gained momentum as programmers
from around the world joined nto the project, communicating and
delivering their work through the Internet. De Icaza and the other
programmers involved had to agree to use one single version of the
base program. They decided on one and began to write Gnome's
programs on top of it.
 &HT;    Now, less than two years later, De Icaza and his team are set to
post Gnome 1.0 on the Internet (www.gnome. org) though the first
version may be somewhat of a rough draft. It will include a word
processing program, spreadsheet and other features built to look
and feel like Microsoft Office, with two exceptions. First, they
are free, whereas Office costs about US$200 in Mexico. Second,
since the source codes are available to the public, any programmer
can fix bugs and make customized adjustments that adapt the
programs to the needs of a particular person or organization. 'I
don't want to live in a world where I'm dependent on what Microsoft
does and where I'm tied down to Microsoft's mistakes,' says De
Icaza.
 &HT;    Among its followers, which tend to be professional computer
scientists or devoted amateurs, this is the charm of Linux. As
individual improvements are made, word spreads rapidly by Internet
within the global community of software programmers, who then
download the updates. Many Linux programmers are motivated by an
esthetic impulse to create good software; others simply dislike
Microsoft and its stranglehold on the software industry. But most
computer users are not charmed by the idea of tweaking obscure
software codes. Tapping that realization was key to turning Bill
Gates'' dynamo into the mega wealth creator of the 1990s.
 &HT;    Despite its communal roots, there is money to be made in
open-source software, too. At least two U.S. companies, Red Hat and
Caldera Systems, put the best open-source software they can find on
compact disks and sell them for a small fee. The firms also charge
for technical support and service. Companies in Latin America are
catching on. Conectiva Informatica, a Brazilian software firm,
distributes a CD and user's manual of Linux programs. ``We estimate
there are about 100,000 Linux installations in Brazil, including
more than 50 percent of Internet service providers, a large private
bank and public hospitals, to name a few,'' says Sandro Henrique, a
company executive. ``We're always looking for ways to find new
customers.''
 &HT;    Neither Linux nor Gnome will spark a conversion of the masses
from Microsoft, but numerous potential customers do exist.
Organizations that have their own technology staff and that would
rather spend time than money on computing solutions are prime
targets. These institutions could provide the spark for wider
recognition and usage.
 &HT;    Indeed, Gnome had already begun catching on even before the
first official version hit the Internet.
 &HT;    Last year, Mexico's Public Education Ministry began buying
thousands of computers to outfit Scholar Net, a program to spread
computer literacy in the schools. Within five years, offidials aim
to install 140,000 computer labs with an average of seven computers
per lab, nearly a million machines.
 &HT;    Project leader Arturo Espinosa faced a choice. He could have
paid licensing fees to Microsoft on hundreds of thousands of copies
of Wows 98 and Microsoft Office at a cost of $55 a pop, plus $500
licensing fees on Windows NT for each of the project's servers. The
alternative to paying tens of millions of dollars was to take a
risk on a preliminary version of Gnome and pay nothing. ``In the
case of an educational system, where users don't have to worry
about a lot of packaged software'' says IDC's Kusnetzky, ``Linux
would make a lot of sense.''
 &HT;    Not so, argues Microsoft's Flores, who repeats what he told
Mexico's Education Ministry: ``The problem they face in the future
is who will give them support'' There are not enough people in
Mexico to travel around the country to fix a Linux server. All the
people who know Linux are in Mexico City.''
 &HT;    But Kusnetzky says that support for the two options is hard to
compare. ``Microsoft has a good track record of fixing high-profile
problems quickly, but when dealing with lower visibility issues,
Microsoft's track record isn't quite as good,'' he says. ``Linux is
really working with a different model. It is a group collaboration
rather than a supplier/purchaser model. Linux folks help one
another.''
 &HT;    Espinosa? He chose the freebie.
 &HT;    So far, he reports smooth operations and low cost. To keep the
system current, satellites will beam versions of Gnome as upgrades
are released. Says Espinosa, ``At an average of 20 users per
computer, all of them school children and teachers, these programs
will become a major influence in Mexico.''

PRESSURE GROWS TO REOPEN PROBE OF MURDERS OF CIVIL RIGHTS WORKERS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA, Miss. _ The 1964 murder of three civil rights
workers has cast a shadow over Neshoba County for more than a
generation, and memories are being stirred again by the possibility
of new prosecutions in the infamous case.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since a federal trial against 18 defendants ended
with mixed results, many of the suspects in the original
investigation have lived quietly in this rural, east Mississippi
community. But pressure to reopen the case intensified after state
prosecutors won a murder conviction last August against former Ku
Klux Klan leader Sam Bowers for his role in another 1960s civil
rights slaying.
</P>
<P>
   The new investigation is said to focus on an aging
fundamentalist minister, Edgar Ray ``Preacher'' Killen, according
to people familiar with the case. Several others who stood trial on
federal conspiracy charges more than three decades ago also could
face state charges.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney for Neshoba County, Ken Turner, asked the
FBI in January to turn over its files on the Neshoba investigation.
Because the state never filed murder charges, the prosecutor still
has an option to do so, though Turner has not decided whether to
seek indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Although a massive casino opened near here by a Choctaw tribe
has changed the complexion of the countryside, the county seat of
Philadelphia, with a population of 7,000 and a courthouse square
surrounded by storefronts, has never shaken its association with
the murders. That link was cemented in the public's mind a decade
ago with the film ``Mississippi Burning.''
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of James Chaney, a young black man from nearby
Meridian, and two white companions from New York, Michael Schwerner
and Andrew Goodman, represented one of the most chilling chapters
in the history of the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   In June, 1964, at the beginning of a ``Freedom Summer''
operation in Mississippi, the three activists were arrested here on
a traffic violation. According to testimony, a death warrant for
Schwerner had been ordered by Bowers, who was the imperial wizard
of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. While the civil rights
workers were detained, a posse composed of Neshoba County Deputy
Sheriff Cecil Price and several Klansmen assembled.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after their release from jail, the three men were
intercepted on a lonely road four miles outside Philadelphia,
executed, and buried under a red clay dam.
</P>
<P>
   President Lyndon B. Johnson dispatched dozens of FBI agents to
the state to look for the missing civil rights workers, even as
local authorities suggested their disappearance was a hoax. Six
weeks later, the bodies were discovered when an informant led the
FBI to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The state never sought indictments, but federal prosecutors
charged 18 men with conspiracy to violate the civil rights of the
three victims and brought the defendants to trial in Meridian in
1967.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers, regarded as the mastermind behind the killing, was
convicted and served six years. After his release from prison,
Bowers lived as a free man for more than two decades in Laurel, 80
miles south of here, until a state jury found him guilty last year
of ordering the murder of Vernon Dahmer, an NAACP leader, in 1966.
He is serving a life sentence at the Mississippi state
pentitentiary.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Sheriff Price and five others were also convicted in the
1967 trial. Price served four years in federal prison, then
returned to his family here. He worked for a trucking firm owned by
Olen Burrage, a wealthy Philadelphia landowner who was acquitted in
the case. (The bodies of Chaney, Schwerner, and Goodman were found
on Burrage's property.) Price joined the local Shriners
organization, and later became a drivers license tester for the
state until he was recently indicted in federal court for
falsifying test results.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Lawrence Rainey and seven others were acquitted in 1967.
Rainey went on to work as a security guard in Meridian, and several
of his codefendants still live in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The cases against ``Preacher'' Killen and two others were
declared a mistrial when the jury failed to reach a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe the jury had a tough time because not enough
was brought out'' on Killen, said former FBI agent Jim Ingram.
Ingram headed the agency's civil rights desk in Mississippi in 1964
and currently is the state public safety commissioner. Killen
appears to be the key target in the current investigation, said
Ingram, who testified against Bowers in last year's trial.
</P>
<P>
   Although Killen was implicated in two confessions given to the
FBI, the statements were not used in the 1967 trial.
</P>
<P>
   According to transcripts of the confessions published recently
by a Jackson newspaper, the Clarion-Ledger, James Jordan, a Neshoba
County Klansman, said Killen told him that ``they had three civil
rights workers in jail in Philadelphia and that they needed their
`asses tore up.' '' Jordan admitted his guilt in a plea-bargain
arrangement with federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   After FBI agents tracked down another Klansman, Horace Doyle
Barnette, in Louisiana five months after the murders, they obtained
a second confession in which Barnette said Killen had told a group
of Klansmen, ``We have a place to bury them and a man to run the
'dozer to cover them up.'' Barnette later renounced the confession,
but he was convicted in the 1967 trial and sentenced to three years
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jack Rucker, a retired FBI agent who worked on the
case 35 years ago, ``Killen was right in the middle of planning to
get the group together'' to carry out the murders. In a telephone
interview from his home in Alabama, Rucker said Killen escaped with
a mistrial because the jury concentrated ``on the ones there at the
shooting and let the ones who planned it get off.''
</P>
<P>
   Killen professed innocence and lashed back at the FBI in a brief
interview last week. He said his accusers ``were told what to say
by the FBI.'' Killen said the agency tried to pit suspects against
each other during the original investigation. Rucker, Killen said,
``was the one carrying the money around to pay them off.''
</P>
<P>
   Killen, 74, denied any Klan affiliations and said no authorities
have questioned him lately. He is a Baptist minister with relatives
in Neshoba County and lives on a farm near Philadelphia, but no
longer has a church.
</P>
<P>
   The case has stirred passions long after the first
investigations were closed. About a decade ago, Dick Molpus, a
member of one of Neshoba County's leading families, publicly
expressed regret at a black church built on the ashes of a
sanctuary burned here in 1964. Molpus was secretary of state at the
time. Four years ago, as the Democratic nominee for governor,
Molpus was ridiculed for the apology by his victorious opponent,
Republican Governor Kirk Fordice.
</P>
<P>
   Asked the other day about the prospect of reopening the case,
Molpus said: ``I don't think murder can be forgiven. There's no
statute of limitation. If the evidence is pulled together, I
believe the attorney general and the district attorney should act
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Survivors of the victims never let the case die. Ben Chaney, a
brother of the slain Mississippian, pushed for years to reopen the
case. Earlier this year, Schwerner's widow, Rita, called upon state
Attorney General Mike Moore to ``bring closure to these events by
the vigorous pursuit of justice.'' Moore lent state investigators
to local prosecutors in the Bowers case last year, but has made no
moves yet in the Neshoba affair.
</P>
<P>
   Obie Clark, president of the NAACP chapter in Chaney's hometown
of Meridian, said he was encouraged by developments. ``The level of
interest in the case is still high'' in black circles in
Mississippi, he said, because of the successful prosecution of
Bowers and Byron De La Beckwith, who was convicted five years ago
for the 1963 murder of NAACP leader Medgar Evers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're optimistic,'' Clark said. ``At least the district
attorney's looking at it. That's something we never had before.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of District Attorney Turner say he is in an awkward
position. He will be condemned by some if he chooses not to
prosecute, said Don Kilgore, a local attorney. Yet if he seeks
indictments, ``it could kill him politically'' by antagonizing
those who do not want the old wounds reopened.
</P>
<P>
   Kilgore and Fent Deweese, another lawyer who was a teenager at
Philadelphia High School when the murders took place, discussed the
town's dilemma over lunch here.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went into the service and would be asked where I was
from, people would say `That's where they killed the civil rights
workers.' It stigmatized me,'' Kilgore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got really good people who live here,'' Deweese said,
and the infamy is ``a hell of a burden.'' Reviving the case ``will
bring closure for the families'' of the victims ``and cause serious
problems here.''
</P>
<P>
   But because of its painful history, both men said Philadelphia
is prepared for a new ordeal.

WHAT IS BIG BANK'S BIG BOSS GOING TO DO FOR BOSTON?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parochial thinkers want to know. What is the king of the hill
going to do for the city on a hill?
</P>
<P>
   Terry Murray, chief executive of Fleet Financial Group Inc., is
being touted as a visionary and dealmaker extraordinaire for
putting together Fleet's proposed merger with BankBoston Corp. If a
few thousand people lose their jobs and consumers lose a banking
choice, so what? As the '90s draw to a close, this much is clear:
The big picture counts, not the little one, and certainly not the
little people.
</P>
<P>
   And Murray is truly master of the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   He sketched out a career of power and success from humble
beginnings in Woonsocket, R.I., and a job at a tiny Providence
bank. First he built that tiny bank into the nation's
ninth-largest. And now the merger of Fleet and BankBoston will
produce a superregional institution, Fleet Boston Corp. Its
combined $178 billion in assets stand to make it the country's
eighth-largest bank and a strong national and international
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question remains: Can a big thinker like Murray think
small _ as in Boston?
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry played the Boston card,'' an ever-anonymous BankBoston
executive confided to the Globe. He was explaining how Murray
sealed the deal with Chad Gifford, BankBoston's chief executive, by
playing to his rival's loyalty to this city, not to mention a
propensity for high-profile do-gooder acts like carving turkeys at
the Pine Street Inn.
</P>
<P>
   After playing the Boston card to make the deal, what will Murray
do with the entire deck?
</P>
<P>
   He flashed in and out of the Hub when he acquired the failed
Bank of New England in 1991. It was clear then that his heart,
soul, and home remained in Rhode Island. After taking over Shawmut
in 1995, Boston became Fleet's official headquarters, and Murray
purchased the obligatory antique-filled condo in the Four Seasons.
His heart, soul, and home still remained in Rhode Island. Since
then, however, he has taken steps that show some promising
commitment to this city and state.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Fleet donated $13.5 million to charitable causes in
the Northeast, according to bank spokesman Jim Mahoney.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Fleet stepped up in a big way in 1998 to sponsor
``Monet in the 20th Century,'' a blockbuster show at the Museum of
Fine Arts. The bank contributed $1.2 million to the museum and
spent a million dollars more to make the exhibit available to the
broadest possible audience.
</P>
<P>
   The scale, says Mahoney, ``reflected Fleet's coming of age as a
corporate citizen in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Fleet also contributed $1 million to the Boston public
schools. It was targeted to fund an effort by the Harvard School of
Education to provide professional development.
</P>
<P>
   The bank will make more Monet-like contributions, says Mahoney.
But beyond outright corporate giving, what role will Murray play in
ongoing civic debates?
</P>
<P>
   This week, Fleet Financial announced that it is negotiating a
groundbreaking, multimillion sponsorship deal with Major League
Baseball that would create a national presence for the bank. The
deal would make Fleet the first bank to become a national sponsor
of any of the four major sports leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Such interest in national sports lending raises another obvious
local question: What about the Patriots?
</P>
<P>
   New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, a longtime BankBoston
customer, just happens to be a potential new Fleet Boston customer
just as Kraft's plan to move the team to Hartford could be falling
apart.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there is one last opportunity to come up with a
Massachusetts solution. And perhaps Murray can be the one to seize
it. Not much money _ just a lot of ego _ stood between the House
and Senate versions of a plan to renovate Foxboro Stadium. Could
Murray help lead the respective egos to a comfortable middle
ground?
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's Mahoney says Murray would not intervene if Kraft goes
forward with a Hartford move. But if Kraft is contemplating a move
to another region of the country, Mahoney says, ``Terry would
absolutely do whatever he could to try to prevent that from
happening. He does think that having the Patriots in the region is
an important element of the local regional economy. He would
certainly participate actively in any efforts to keep the team from
leaving the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his Irish-American roots, Harvard degree, and front-row
Fenway box seat, Murray is an outsider here. That's not necessarily
bad; he is less encumbered by petty political and personality
issues that inevitably undercut local policy.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects him to relinquish his Narragansett homestead or
hand out Thanksgiving turkeys. Sure, he has a banking empire to
run. But since he is supposedly running it out of this city, it
would be nice to see him play the role of Boston business leader on
issues that go beyond a bank's asset base.

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CIUDAD DE MEXICO _ Mientras teclea en una de las tres PC de la
oficina a la velocidad del rayo, Miguel de Icaza esta completamente
inmerso en su atrevido plan de recuperar el sector de programas
informaticos de manos de las grandes empresas de la industria. En
su empleo diurno, De Icaza, de 25 anos, supervisa la red
informatica del Instituto de Ciencias Nucleares de la Universidad
Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM). Pero de noche coordina una
pequena guerrilla de programadores unidos por la Internet y
enfrascados en una batalla global contra el dominio de Microsoft
sobre los programas operativos.
 &HT;    De Icaza y su equipo han creado software que compite con los
populares productos Windows y Office de Microsoft. Es un grupo de
voluntarios con el espiritu de colaboracion que imperaba en los
primeros tiempos de la Internet. Su producto, Gnome, es gratis.
 &HT;    Lo que parecia ser un esfuerzo liliputiense ha llegado a
considerarse la mayor amenaza a las ganancias de la todopoderosa
industria de programas informaticos, incluido su mayor y mas
acaudalado miembro, Microsoft. Desde hace mucho los aficionados a
la programacion usan la Internet para distribuir productos creados
con fines de entretenimiento, para causas caritativas y muchas
veces para resolver problemas importantes. Sin importar sus
razones, la actividad que despliega De Icaza lo coloca en la
primera trinchera de una avanzada cada vez mayor de expertos en
informatica que, con el comun denominador de la Internet, se han
lanzado a aniquilar al gigante.
 &HT;    De Icaza ya gano la primera batalla: la Secretaria de Educacion
Publica de Mexico ha escogido Gnome, en vez del paquete estandar de
Microsoft, para el proyecto Red Escolar, que tiene por fin instalar
en las escuelas un millon de computadoras conectadas a la Internet.
Y los ejecutivos de Microsoft han comenzado a sentir la presion:
``Todas las semanas nos reunimos con la direccion de la Red
Escolar,'' dice Alejandro Flores, quien afirma que Microsoft tiene
un acuerdo con la Secretaria para suministrarle programas de
Windows. ``Si quieren negociar precio, estamos dispuestos a hacerlo
para que usen nuestro producto,'' afirma, no importa a que precio.
Incluso gratis.
 &HT;    Pero De Icaza puede competir aunque Microsoft regale su
producto. El arma mas poderosa en el arsenal de Gnome es Linux, un
programa operativo. Linux es fruto de un amplio esfuerzo de
colaboracion liderado por Richard Stallman, un conocido programador
del Instituto Tecnologico de Massachusetts (MIT), el programador
finlandes Linus Torvalds y miles de expertos de todo el mundo. El
complejo programa es un magnifico ejemplo de lo que se conoce como
programas de fuente abierta, que no tienen derechos de autor. De
hecho, cualquiera con la habilidad necesaria puede mejorarlo y la
unica condicion es que los usuarios pasen a otros esas mejoras.
 &HT;    Los que defienden el movimiento de programas de acceso libre
dicen que como resultado de una profunda colaboracion, sus
programas son mas estables y mejores que otros por los que hay que
pagar en el mercado. Para las organizaciones escasas de fondos, los
productos de acceso libre tienen otra gran ventaja: son gratis.
 &HT;    Los defensores de Windows son los mas preocupados. ``Linux crece
muy rapido, mucho mas que otros productos de fuente abierta,'' dice
Flores. ``Microsoft ya trabaja en una estrategia contra eso.''
 &HT;    Aunque es practicamente desconocido fuera de los circulos de
expertos, Linux ya cuenta con millones de usuarios avanzados y es
el sistema operativo de enormes redes empresariales y servidores de
Internet en todo el mundo. Los expertos en informatica y los
administradores de sistemas lo admiran por su fuerza y porque
pueden modificarlo para adaptarlo a sus necesidades individuales.
Los proveedores de servicios de Internet lo prefieren por todo lo
anterior, pero lo que mas los atrae es que se trata de un producto
gratis en un mercado con escasos margenes de ganancias. Los fuertes
lazos de Linux con los expertos informaticos que pueblan la
Internet tambien garantizan que los programas Linux puedan bajarse
desde practicamente cualquier parte del mundo, lo que resulta una
enorme ventaja en materia de distribucion.
 &HT;    Pero lo que siempre le habia faltado a Linux eran programas para
gente comun y corriente. No hace mucho, todos los usuarios de
computadoras personales enfrentaban el mismo problema. Entonces, a
mediados de los anos 80, la primera maquina Apple de Macintosh, y
despues, Windows, de Microsoft, revolucionaron la informatica de
escritorio con aplicaciones faciles de usar. El uso del raton
permitio a los usuarios operar una computadora sin la necesidad de
entender lo que sucedia en el cerebro mecanico. ``La mayoria de la
gente solo quiere una computadora que realice alguna actividad
util,'' afirma Dan Kutsnetzky, analista de International Data Corp.
 &HT;    De Icaza comenzo a usar Linux a los 18 anos, cuando estudiaba
informatica en la Universidad Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM). Alli
conocio un proyecto aleman llamado KDE, que intentaba crear un
sistema Linux que funcionara de manera similar a Windows. Pero
despues de probarlo, se sintio frustrado y se quejo a sus amigos
sobre los defectos del sistema. En vez de compartir su pena, sus
amigos lo instaron a encontrar una solucion.
 &HT;    Y asi lo hizo.
 &HT;    A los pocos dias habia formado un pequeno grupo de programadores
con el fin de crear aplicaciones para Linux. Una semana mas tarde
ya habian colocado en la Internet las primeras lineas de codigo y
le puso nombre al proyecto: Gnome (GNU Network Object Model
Environment). ``Los primeros programas no hacian nada,'' explica De
Icaza, ``pero mostraban que teniamos intenciones serias, y eso
genero mucho interes.''
 &HT;    El proyecto cobro impulso cuando programadores de todo el mundo
comenzaron a colaborar a traves de la Internet. De Icaza y los
otros programadores tenian que ponerse de acuerdo para usar una
sola version del programa base. Escogieron una y comenzaron a crear
programas Gnome sobre esa plataforma.
 &HT;    Menos de dos anos despues, De Icaza y su equipo estan listos
para colocar Gnome 1.0 en la Internet (www.gnome.org.), aunque esta
primera version pudiera resultar una especie de borrador: incluira
un procesador de textos, una hoja de calculo y otros, muy parecido
a Office de Microsoft, con dos excepciones. Primero, es gratis,
mientras que Office cuesta US$200 en Mexico. Segundo, como el
publico en general tiene acceso a la fuente del codigo de
programacion, cualquier programador puede corregir fallas y hacer
ajustes especiales para satisfacer las necesidades de una
institucion o persona en particular. ``No quiero vivir en un mundo
donde tenga que depender de lo que decida Microsoft y tenga que
sufrir las consecuencias de los errores de Microsoft,'' dice De
Icaza.
 &HT;    Entre sus seguidores, que por lo general son especialistas
profesionales o entusiastas de la informatica, este es el encanto
de Linux. A medida que avanzan las mejoras, se corre la voz por la
Internet entre la comunidad mundial de programadores, quienes
copian las versiones actualizadas. Muchos de los programadores de
Linux estan motivados por el impulso estetico de crear buenos
programas, a otros sencillamente les disgusta Microsoft y su
dominio del sector. Pero a la mayoria de los usuarios de
computadoras no les interesa la idea de modificar los complicados
codigos. Darse cuenta de eso fue lo que hizo que Bill Gates se
convirtiera en el creador de riquezas que ha llegado a ser.
 &HT;    A pesar de sus raices comunitarias, en el mercado de software de
fuente abierta se puede ganar dinero. Al menos dos empresas
estadounidenses, Red Hat y Caldera Systems, graban en discos
compactos lo mejor del software de fuente abierta que circula en la
Internet y lo venden a cambio de una pequena cifra. La firma
tambien cobra por servicios de apoyo tecnico. Y las companias
latinoamericanas han comenzado a ponerse al dia. Conectiva
Informatica, una firma brasilena de software, distribuye un CD y un
manual para programas de Linux. ``Calculamos que en Brasil se han
instalado unos 100.000 programas Linux, incluidos mas del 50 por
ciento de los proveedores de servicios de Internet, un importante
banco privado y varios hospitales publicos, para solo mencionar
algunos,'' explica Sandro Henrique, un ejecutivo de Conectiva
Informatica. ``Siempre buscamos la forma de encontrar nuevos
clientes.''
 &HT;    Ni Linux ni Gnome tienen la fuerza para lograr una desercion
masiva de los programas de Microsoft, pero hay muchos clientes
potenciales, como las organizaciones que cuentan con tecnologia y
personal propios y que prefieren gastar tiempo en vez de dinero en
soluciones informaticas. Estas instituciones podrian convertirse en
la chispa que de lugar a un reconocimiento y uso mas amplios.
 &HT;    De hecho, Gnome ya ha comenzado a prender, incluso antes que la
primera version oficial llegue a la Internet.
 &HT;    El ano pasado, la Secretaria de Educacion Publica de Mexico
comenzo a comprar miles de PC para el programa Red Escolar. Los
encargados del programa planean que en los primeros cinco anos se
instalen 140.000 laboratorios de computacion, con un promedio de
siete maquinas cada uno, es decir, casi un millon de PC.
 &HT;    El lider del proyecto, Arturo Espinosa, se vio en una
disyuntiva: pagar a Microsoft por las licencias operativas de
cientos de miles de copias de Windows 98 y Office, a un costo de
US$55 cada una, mas US$500 por concepto de Windows NT para cada
servidor del proyecto. La alternativa era arriesgarse con la
version preliminar de Gnome y no pagar nada. ``En el caso de un
sistema educacional, donde los usuarios no tienen que preocuparse
por muchos paquetes de software, Linux tendria mucho sentido,''
dice Kusnetzky, de IDC.
 &HT;    Pero Flores, de Microsoft, opina lo contrario, y repite lo que
le expreso a la Secretaria de Educacion: ``El problema que
enfrentan en el futuro es quien les dara apoyo. En Mexico no hay
gente suficiente para viajar por todo el pais para arreglar un
servidor que funcione con Linux. Todos los que conocen Linux estan
en la Ciudad de Mexico.''
 &HT;    Pero Kusnetzky afirma que no se puede comparar el apoyo de las
dos opciones. ``Microsoft tiene un buen historial de solucionar
rapidamente problemas graves, pero cuando se trata de asuntos
menores, no es igual,'' dijo. ``Linux realmente trabaja con un
modelo diferente. Es una colaboracion de grupo en vez de un modelo
suministrador/cliente. La gente que trabaja con Linux se ayudan
mutuamente.''
 &HT;    Espinosa se decidio por Linux.
 &HT;    Hasta ahora informa que las operaciones marchan bien y a bajo
costo. Para mantener el sistema actualizado, se recibiran las
nuevas versiones de Gnome a medida que se produzcan. ``A un
promedio de 20 usuarios por computadora, todos ellos maestros y
estudiantes, esos programas tendran una gran influencia en
Mexico,'' pronostica Espinosa.

HOW FAR WILL GAY CHARACTER GO ON THE WB?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kevin Williamson talks rather proudly of the muted reaction to
his shrewdly introduced gay character on his shrewdly deceptive
drama ``Dawson's Creek,'' but the producer is bound to face the
same content constraints that made Doug Savant a sexless, pitiful
bore on ``Melrose Place.''
</P>
<P>
   Once that sweet-faced Jack (Kerr Smith) irons out the wrinkles
of his hormonal angst, isn't the exploration of sexual territory
next? After all, ``Dawson's Creek'' remains a sweaty, hormonal
playground. And that would be the true test of how much America has
changed and grown and become accepting of gay and lesbian
relationships, as Williamson suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Savant now, and he'll gladly share his lingering
disappointment over the 1994 scene in which his character, Matt,
was all set to lock lips with a handsome suitor, only to see the
camera go elsewhere when the Fox censors came down with a case of
wobbly knees.
</P>
<P>
   The same scenario played out later that season on ``Northern
Exposure,'' when Don McCanus (Erick) and Doug Ballard (Ron)
``married,'' only to have the camera pan away from their nuptial
smooch.
</P>
<P>
   Little has changed since then.
</P>
<P>
   Gay and lesbian characters in broadcast network series are said
to have graduated from rare exception, but to what _ comedic
novelty? Besides, take a close look at the 20 or so gay characters
(most played by straight actors) on weekly series. Few are on
dramas, fewer are sexual and none, if they're men, affectionately
embrace.
</P>
<P>
   What a tricky creative challenge for writers, this whole gay
thing. How clear that as the kiss-avoidance pattern suggests, TV is
still very wary of offending not so much the day-to-day viewer but
the noisy homophobes making up the often-powerful fringe groups
that keep advertisers' numbers on their speed dials.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how hard I've tried, I can't explain how ``Dawson's
Creek'' has managed to remain under the radar with this story line.
Is it because you could conduct a live execution on the
little-watched WB network without anyone noticing? Or is it that
today's teens really do see the world through a more accepting
lens?
</P>
<P>
   The only organized mass protest has come from Mike Gabbard,
president of Hawaii-based Stop Promoting Homosexuality
International, an interfaith organization preaching that gay
relationships are unnatural, abnormal and morally disgusting.
</P>
<P>
   Gabbard, a soft-spoken, smart, extraordinarily polite man who
led the charge against legislation legalizing gay marriages in
Hawaii, just happened to be in the ``Dawson's Creek'' stamping
grounds of Wilmington, N.C., when the story line was first
introduced. He challenged the teen audience to which he was
lecturing to ``do something'' proactive, and within days, the teens
were pacing outside the ``Dawson's Creek'' set with banners and
signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read some newspaper accounts which said there has been no
protest, and that kind of amazes me,'' Gabbard says. ``We were
right there at the start. My only theory is that people write not
what's really there but what makes their point.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabbard won't say ``liberal conspiracy,'' but what most concerns
him is that Williamson, who is gay, and the WB, which loves
controversy and the ratings it may bring, plan to make Jack a
likable fellow. Next season, he'll be given enough athletic skills
to quarterback the football team. He'll certainly have enough
enemies to infuse his story lines with drama, but his character
will possess just enough charm to keep the audience returning.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Williamson is using the program to show
``positive'' aspects of homosexual life in much the same way the
producers are trying to level the playing field on the NBC comedy
``Will &AMP; Grace,'' in which there's both the strait-laced gay guy
and the animated queen.
</P>
<P>
   Gabbard thinks that's another series worthy of a cancellation
slip. ``It's almost as if they (networks) think being gay is a
selling point,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's Hollywood. Thing is, the mere fact that a character is
gay is no longer interesting in and of itself.
</P>
<P>
   That the media quickly questioned whether the furor over
``Ellen'' was a ploy to revitalize a dying comedy suggested that
we'd already absorbed the premise of having gay characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dawson's Creek'' has pushed the envelope in its mature subject
matter as it relates to high schoolers. It will be interesting to
see whether Williamson actually creates what would be a
multifaceted dramatic gay character, libido and all.
</P>
<P>
   Or will the WB be stricken with wobbly knees?

A FAMILY SEDAN NO LONGER HAS TO BE HUGE, SEDATE AND UGLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's just amazing what automakers can do with a sedan these
days.
</P>
<P>
   No more does a five-passenger car have to be a huge, sedate,
ugly family-hauler; thanks to Lexus and a few other automakers who
have decided that fun, performance and even excitement mix well
with a family car.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Lexus introduced two exciting new sedans, the
six-cylinder GS 300 and the V-8 GS 400.
</P>
<P>
   The two cars are almost identical except for their drivetrains:
the GS 300, already powerful and decidedly fun to drive with its
3.0-liter inline-six engine with 225 horsepower; and our test car
for the week, the hot-rod 1999 GS 400, with a 4.0-liter, 32-valve,
300-horsepower V-8.
</P>
<P>
   Both have rear-wheel drive like traditional performance cars,
and are designed specifically to provide a pleasurable driving
experience, not just a comfy ride.
</P>
<P>
   If you have never driven the GS 400, you'd probably be perfectly
happy with the GS 300. But once you get a taste of the V-8 in the
GS 400, you won't want to go back to a V-6.
</P>
<P>
   The only automatic-transmission sedan I've driven that was
faster than the GS 400 was the 1999 Mercedes-Benz E55, a speedster
with a 350-horsepower engine, but a price tag that is $20,000
higher than that of the GS 400 that I tested.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexus is a better value, with a sticker price of $49,279
(including $495 transportation).
</P>
<P>
   Lexus, which burst onto the luxury-car scene in 1990 with the ES
250 and LS 400 sedans, has built such an impressive model lineup
during the past nine years that these cars have become the standard
by which other luxury cars are judged, even the Mercedes-Benzes and
BMWs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lexus has overtaken all others to become the
best-selling luxury brand in the United States so far this year
(through February), with help from such models as the GS 400 and
the brand's two sport-utilities, the RX 300 and LX 470. The
sport-utilities alone have accounted for 45 percent of Lexus sales
this year.
</P>
<P>
   If you have to buy a sedan for family or business purposes, and
you can afford to spend 50 grand, the GS 400 is worth a look. One
reason Lexus is so popular among baby boomers who buy luxury cars
is Toyota's commitment to quality and perfection in its upscale
brand.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexus slogan, ``The Relentless Pursuit of Perfection,'' is
part of a firmly ingrained corporate culture at Toyota; it's not
just a catchy phrase dreamed up by some advertising agency. One
merely has to touch any part of a Lexus, inside or out, and then
look closely at that part to see that nothing _ absolutely nothing
_ has been left to chance. There is careful thought behind every
square inch of a Lexus.
</P>
<P>
   One reason I like the GS 400 so much is that it has no
gratuitous trappings of luxury like so many other luxury autos
(particularly some of the U.S.-built models). Instead, it is a
practical, well-built car with modern amenities and an
extraordinary investment in the heart of the vehicle: its
drivetrain.
</P>
<P>
   The GS 400 is positioned in price between the entry-level ES 300
sedan and the prestige luxury LS 400 model, both of which have
their own strong selling points. What the GS 400 gives up in luxury
trappings found in the more expensive LS 400, it more than makes up
for in performance. I would trade some luxury for performance any
time.
</P>
<P>
   With the V-8 engine and this year's new five-speed automatic
transmission with manual-shift feature, the GS 400 can zip from
zero to 60 mph in less than six seconds. That might not be quite as
fast as the E55's 5.4-second zero-to-60 mph performance, but it's
still doggone fast for a practical family sedan that holds five
passengers and a truck that holds nearly 15 cubic feet of luggage.
</P>
<P>
   All of that power comes with some pretty nifty safety features
built into the GS 400, too, starting with side air bags for the
driver and front passenger. Included are the standard Vehicle Skid
Control or VSC system, an integration of the car's electronic
traction control and antilock braking system.
</P>
<P>
   The VSC uses a computer brain to compare the vehicle's turning
direction with the driver's steering, braking and throttle inputs
to think ahead and avoid letting the vehicle go into a skid. It
accomplishes this automatically and seamlessly by applying brakes
to the proper wheels and/or modulating the throttle as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Although the GS 400 might not look quite as luxurious as an LS
400, this still is one truly comfortable and well-laid-out vehicle.
The cabin is spacious enough for five full-size adults to sit in
comfort for a short drive around town or a trip across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The GS 400's $45,465 base price (not including shipping)
includes a whole list of standard amenities such as leather
interior with walnut trim, dual-zone automatic climate control,
power-adjustable front seats, power windows/mirrors/door locks,
tilt steering wheel, steering-wheel-mounted transmission shift
buttons, gas-pressurized shock absorbers, 215-watt AM/FM/cassette
audio system, a theft-deterrent system with engine immobilizer,
remote keyless entry and much more.
</P>
<P>
   Our test model came with Z-rated tires (a $215 option, designed
to handle speeds above 100 mph _ as if there were any place in the
United States where you could legally drive that fast), a $49 trunk
mat, and a $3,055 premium package that added an in-dash six-disc CD
changer, one-touch open/close moon roof, heated front seats and
high-intensity headlights.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy is impressive for a vehicle that is both practical
and really fast: 17 miles per gallon in the city and 24 mpg on the
highway.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   At A Glance:
</P>
<P>
   1999 Lexus GS 400 sedan
</P>
<P>
   THE PACKAGE: Midsize, four-door, five-passenger, V-8 powered,

</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S NEW: For 1999, a new five-speed automatic transmission
offers optional manual shifting for more driver control, with shift
buttons on the steering-wheel spokes.
</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS: With its 300-horsepower V-8, this is one of the
fastest sedans on the road. Combined with Lexus quality and luxury,
that power makes this an impressive driver's machine that also is a
practical family car.

NOVEL IS A TESTAMENT TO GRISHAM'S SPIRITUAL INTERESTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scene is deep in the jungles of Brazil. Rachel, a missionary
who refuses to accept a billion-dollar inheritance, is asking Nate,
a hardened, twice-divorced and alcoholic American lawyer, to pray
with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear God, forgive me of my sins, and help me to forgive those
who have sinned against me,'' Nate prays, repeating words given to
him by Rachel.
</P>
<P>
   Then Nate had ``an odd sensation as his burdens seemed to be
lifted; his shoulders felt lighter, his head clearer, his soul was
less troubled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your sins are forgiven, Nate,'' Rachel tells him.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a passage from the latest Christian novel? Not at all.
It comes from John Grisham's newest bestseller, ``The Testament.''
</P>
<P>
   Grisham has another gripping plot about a lawyer trying to track
down the missionary in Brazil to persuade her to accept her
inheritance. The story is his most unabashed effort yet to tell
about his own Christian faith in one of his legal thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   The novel, like his others, including ``A Time to Kill,'' ``The
Firm,'' and ``The Client,'' is being snapped up by readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Grisham's best novel in years,'' writes Deirdre Donahue
in USA Today. Malcolm Jones in Newsweek describes the book as ``a
compulsory page turner.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel has plenty of action _ storms, a plane crash, a
terminally ill billionaire leaping to his death from a building.
</P>
<P>
   But the spiritual emphasis is pervasive.
</P>
<P>
   During an almost fatal bout with dengue fever, Nate finds the
missionary mysteriously at his side, holding his hand and telling
him, ``I'm here, Nate. God sent me to protect you. ... You are not
going to die. ... God has plans for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The fever fades and Nate sleeps, dreaming of ``angels _
white-robed young maidens floating above the clouds above him,
humming hymns he'd never heard but that somehow seemed familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   One reader didn't like the God talk, though.
</P>
<P>
   He complained on the Barnes &AMP; Noble Web site that Grisham has
become ``a Bible-thumpin' preacher trying to save my ... and your
... poor, blackened soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Countering that view on the same Web site is a retired professor
of English, who referred to Grisham as ``John the Apostle.''
</P>
<P>
   He refers to one episode in the novel in which Nate, looking for
Rachel, walks into a small Brazilian church where he faces a mural
of Christ on the cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``He studied the crucifixion, the nails through His hands, the
sword in His side, the agony in His face. Did they really kill Him
in such a dreadful manner?'' Grisham writes.
</P>
<P>
   The English professor said the words epitomize what Holy Week is
all about. And he compares Grisham to American novelist Flannery
O'Connor, a Roman Catholic, in proclaiming redemptive Christian
orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the story, Nate's addiction to power, money and
booze has faded as he turns to God.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Grisham well aren't surprised by the religious
subject matter in ``The Testament.'' Write about what you know,
teachers of creative writing always advise.
</P>
<P>
   And Grisham knows about Brazil and missionaries.
</P>
<P>
   While a member of First Baptist Church in Oxford, Miss.,
Grisham, 44, went on several volunteer mission trips to Brazil. He
helped build churches.
</P>
<P>
   Grisham told USA Today that he liked the experience so much that
he plans to volunteer for more mission trips in the future.
</P>
<P>
   If he does, don't be surprised if you see more Grisham novels
telling intriguing tales about sin, faith and redemption.

TREES MEAN ADVENTURE ON THESE SKI TRAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN WECHSLER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOWE, Vt. _ Tim Kelly stood on his skis, poised deep in the
snow-covered woods on the side of Mount Mansfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love glade skiing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And then he took off, expertly following a straight downhill
line between trees, at a speed I could never hope to match.
</P>
<P>
   Out on Stowe Mountain Resort's many trails, the slopes were icy
and hard. But here in the trees, there was ample soft powder and no
people. And even though I often descend at a bumbling pace, I'd
still rather ski in here than out on the trails.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't mind the risk, glade or tree skiing is one
of the most exciting ways to schuss down a mountain.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, many resorts prohibited people from heading into
the trees, or at least frowned upon it. Not any more. In the past
five years, New England's best ski areas have been clearing small
trees and branches from wooded areas to encourage expert skiers to
head into the forests. Many glade areas are even marked on ski
maps.
</P>
<P>
   At Stowe, tree skiing always has been allowed. And, with a
70-year ski history, Stowe likely contains more gladed ski runs
than any other mountain on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent weekend, I hooked up with Kelly, a volunteer ski
patroller, for an afternoon of skiing. It would not be an easy
time: most of Stowe's tree routes were cut by local skiers, not by
the mountain. And be assured, they know how to ski. Steep, narrow
routes are the norm, so if you're like me and like to traverse the
slope when it gets too steep, you're going to find yourself
smashing through branches very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Most routes are not official trails. Most, in fact, were made by
locals who climb the slopes in the summer to carve their niche in
the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   For skiers just beginning to explore the woods, Stowe has a huge
area to the left of the trail ``Chinclip.'' Slightly easier is the
place called ``Tres Amigos,'' located off the black diamond trail
``Hayride.''
</P>
<P>
   My favorite is accessed off the Perry Merrill trail, just below
the top of the gondola. A narrow trail leads into a thick forest of
spruce. After some spine-tingling switchbacks, the trail spits you
out on a narrow catwalk of snow below a 100-foot cliff covered in
icicles. You traverse below this incredible spot for what seems
like forever before you reach the end.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's time to dive downhill into more thick woods, following
dozens of lines that twist and curve at a pitch gentle enough for
any reasonable skier to follow without getting hurt.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only the beginning. Kelly says Stowe has trails that
extend way beyond the ski-area boundaries. If you know what you're
doing and where you're going, you can hike to the bottom of a broad
escarpment called ``The Chin.'' From there, a number of lines head
down to the closed highway at the bottom of Smugglers' Notch _ and
a 20-minute walk back to the resort.
</P>
<P>
   Or, you can hike to the top of 4,395-foot Mount Mansfield and
ski down the other side. Such a journey can take several hours or
more. And it's a long way back to the parking lot once you finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The locals take pride in what they cut,'' Kelly said.
``There's a lot of secret stashes around the mountain. And if
someone skis them before the person who cut them, they can get
pretty upset.''
</P>
<P>
   The ice storm that rocked the Northeast last year ruined some of
the trails, but plenty remain, if you know where to look.
</P>
<P>
   It's essential, however, to keep in mind the risk. The ski
patrol does not monitor the glades. And once you're outside
ski-area boundaries, the resort has no obligation to search for
you, or rescue you if you get hurt (though rescue workers most
likely will come and get you if they know where you are).
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a group had to build a snowcave up on The Chin after
getting lost. A helicopter was needed to search for another lost
party.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Bono's skiing death last year illustrates another danger
of tree skiing. You have to know what you're doing, and be
constantly alert.
</P>
<P>
   I find skiing in the woods is generally safe as long as you
maintain a comfortable speed.
</P>
<P>
   There's little grace in glade skiing. You do what you can to ski
safely, and that means falling sometimes to avoid danger or blind
curves. Even Kelly takes a spill now and again.
</P>
<P>
   Stowe is by no means the only mountain with glade skiing.
Killington has several popular areas, including Big Dipper for the
experts and Echo Woods for the intermediate skiers. For beginners,
the easy glades off the Falls Brook Road trail are an excellent
introduction to skiing the trees. Many other glade areas are marked
``fusion zones'' on the map.
</P>
<P>
   Bromley and Mount Snow also have excellent glade areas, as
marked on the trail map. Sugarbush has taken it one step further,
opening a wooded section of the mountain between the south and
north sections of the resort called Slide Brook. When the snow is
deep enough, skiers who pay an extra $30 are taken by a guide from
the top of the mountain to the base, avoiding trails the entire
time. The tour takes several hours, and the skiers are met by a bus
that brings them back to the base lodge.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Gore Mountain is a latecomer to the glade game, but
has made up for that by creating some of the best glades for
intermediate skiers I've ever seen. I'm referring to the Twister
Glade, accessed off the trail by the same name.
</P>
<P>
   The route is wide enough that, on good powder days, you can be
making new tracks all day long. It takes you past cliffs and huge
boulders, going on and on until you wonder if you're still in the
same state. Finally, it drops you off right behind the Adirondack
Express chairlift entrance. You're exhausted, and hungry for more.

DISCLOSING A BROKER'S PAST CRIME  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 28)

<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1971, a 17-year-old New Orleans high school student made the
mistake of his life. A young man he met asked to be introduced to a
drug dealer, and he complied. The acquaintance, who bought a single
orange mescaline pill, turned out to be a narcotics agent, and in
1973, the student, by then in college, was convicted of felony drug
possession in connection with the incident.
</P>
<P>
   His sentence of a year in prison was suspended, and his long
locks of hair were swept off the barbershop floor decades ago.
Today, still in Louisiana, he is a stockbroker agitated by the fear
that his criminal past will be posted on the Internet by the
national organization that registers and regulates securities
brokers _ NASD Regulation Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The broker has made his concern clear to the officer in his firm
who is responsible for adherence to regulations. ``I told my
compliance officer that if this is on the Internet, I'm going to
consider giving up my registration,'' said the broker, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The brokerage industry may be the only major profession in the
country that is planning to systematically disclose negative
information about its members on line. But the ease of Internet
access has prompted a debate within NASD Regulation _ a subsidiary
of the National Association of Securities Dealers _ over whether to
disclose all the information in its brokers' records or to omit
data on felonies committed more than 10 years ago and unrelated to
investing.
</P>
<P>
   The full records, including details of past felony convictions,
work-related disciplinary actions and unsubstantiated customer
complaints, have long been available by mail to anyone who requests
them. But many people familiar with the brokerage business contend
that because the Internet provides instantaneous and anonymous
global access, it constitutes a far more powerful vehicle for
disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   NASD regulators are committed to the general principle of
Internet disclosure. But as they try to reconcile investors' rights
to information with brokers' rights to privacy, they are deadlocked
on the specific question of whether to disclose old felonies not
related to investing.
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly 600,000 registered brokers nationwide, and
scant few of them have felony records, according to NASD
Regulation. However, when NASD Regulation announced its intention
to place broker disclosure information on the Internet, that group
became an extremely vocal minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say they were concerned is putting it mildly,'' said Clark
Hooper, executive vice president at NASD Regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Since the organization put out its request for comments, it has
received scores of e-mail messages, phone calls and letters. Many
have been protests about the proposed felony disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   The NASD has what is called ``statutory immunity'' under
securities law, a status that allows it to publish negative
information about brokers with protection against liability. But
because the relevant provision in the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 makes no reference to the Internet, the NASD and the
Securities and Exchange Commission are working to amend the law,
specifically extending that immunity to on-line disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always indicated that we felt disclosure was the way to
go here, and we're working with Congress and the NASD to resolve
the issues involved,'' said an SEC spokesman, John D. Heine,
adding, ``the sooner the better.''
</P>
<P>
   But others question whether the raw power of the Internet as a
communications tool may change the nature of the disclosures
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody releasing information on the Internet needs to think
not only in terms of the specific use in question, but other ways
it can be used that are totally unrelated,'' said Sheldon Krantz,
chairman of the American Bar Association's task force on law
enforcement and new technology and a partner at Piper &AMP; Marbury in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Louisiana broker said he was concerned that Internet
disclosure would harm not only his business reputation, but also
his standing in his church and his community.
</P>
<P>
   From where Ira Lee Sorkin sits, NASD disclosure already goes too
far, even without the Internet. ``It's a terrible, terrible
system,'' said Sorkin, a former federal prosecutor and SEC official
who is now a partner at Squadron Ellenoff Plesent &AMP; Sheinfeld, a
law firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He sees publishing old felonies unrelated to the investment
business as unjustified, but he expressed greater concern about the
publication of unsubstantiated complaints about brokers. Such
complaints remain in public disclosure records for two years, even
if a broker is found by an adjudicator to have done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a bare allegation out there because a disgruntled
customer is blaming the broker can cause irreversible damage to a
broker even if it is determined after a hearing that he did nothing
improper,'' Sorkin said.
</P>
<P>
   The NASD requested public comment about felony disclosures last
fall and has yet to adopt a policy. ``It's been an absolute split
down the middle,'' Ms. Hooper said. ``There's been no clear-cut
mandate over what should be done.'' But the emotional maelstrom
whirling around the issue is reflected in many of the 97 written
comments the agency has received from consumer advocates,
investors, regulatory agencies, brokerage firms, brokers and
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The AARP, formerly the American Association of Retired People,
has advocated full disclosure, stating in its public comment letter
last September that ``it must be an investor's decision'' to
determine whether a felony conviction is relevant. The AARP
provided the example of ``an investor who had been a victim of
domestic violence'' and who might want to know if a broker had been
convicted of a similar crime and take the business elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is it should be up to the investor,'' said Laura
Polacheck, a policy analyst at the AARP. ``If the investor sees
they had some conviction that occurred decades ago that doesn't
seem to compromise their integrity, that's up to the investor to
make that determination. We are putting trust in the investor to
make his or her decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Louisiana broker, hoping to clear his name once and for all,
hired a lawyer who successfully argued to have the old felony
expunged from his court records. Now he waits for the information
to make its way to the NASD, so that his record there will be
cleared of the felony soon enough to avoid Internet posting.
</P>
<P>
   For him, the fear of humiliation that might result from Internet
publication of his past felony is almost tangible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a guy walking around with a marble in his pocket,''
he said. ``You feel it. It's sometimes uncomfortable when you sit
but no one else can see it. Now it's a baseball in your pocket;
people can see it. It really takes the person down.''

AIR POWER IN YUGOSLAVIA HAS LIMITATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As NATO warplanes continue to pound Yugoslavia,
U.S. strategists say past military operations show that aerial
assaults alone won't compel an adversary to capitulate.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the recent conflict in Bosnia, the Persian Gulf War,
Vietnam and World War II, these experts say that without a
coordinated campaign involving ground troops, victory often remains
elusive or at least inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of the nation's most respected military experts,
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., says the level of force required to
drive Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic, into accepting a
peace agreement has become so great ``that no one is entirely
confident that Serbia can be coerced by the use of air power
alone.'' McCain is a member of the Senate Armed Service Committee
and a former fighter pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Col. James Hunt, an instructor at the National War
College in Washington D.C., notes that the public's distaste for
casualties has forced U.S. leaders to rely on air strikes in
Kosovo, Serbia's rebellious southern province.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perfect world, air power used in conjunction with land
power is the way to go,'' says Hunt, who teaches a course on air
power in modern war to military officers.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-led NATO force is trying to use bombs and missiles
alone to compel Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to pull back
his troops from Kosovo, grant self-rule to its ethnic Albanian
citizens and accept 28,000 NATO ground troops as peacekeepers.
Milosevic, whose troops have been pummeling the Kosovar Albanians
for a year _ killing civilians, burning villages and dispersing
hundreds of thousands of refugees _ has refused.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pape, a Dartmouth College professor of national security
studies, makes this argument for the use of ground troops:
</P>
<P>
   ``History tells us that air power alone never has won a major
war. There isn't a single case. ... We will need a ground force and
could do this by arming the Kosovo Liberation Army,'' the
province's guerrilla fighters. Pape is the author of ``Bombing To
Win: Airpower and Coercion in War.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired Navy Adm. Leighton Smith, who commanded NATO air attacks
against Bosnian Serbs in 1995, agrees. ``People should not delude
themselves into thinking that this thing in Kosovo is going to go
away with the application of air power,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls that NATO launched its air attacks to force the
Bosnian Serbs, who were supported by Milosevic, to sign a peace
treaty with other warring factions. The attacks destroyed key
Bosnian Serb targets, but it wasn't until the Croatians had mounted
a sweeping ground offensive that the Bosnian Serbs agreed to the
settlement, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kosovo might be different, according to Joseph Collins, a
retired Army colonel and former special assistant to the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. Collins notes that in the Kosovo conflict NATO is
using more radar-evading stealth aircraft and more satellite-guided
``smart weapons'' that can hit their targets with precision.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll probably revoke my Army union card for saying this,
but my take is that (such) air power, used in great quantities, is
in fact useful for coercion,'' insists Collins.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed this week by retired Air Force Lt.
Gen. Buster Glosson, the architect of the 1991 Gulf War's air
assault against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only question is: Do we have the political will and
patience to let that campaign continue long enough to accomplish
that knockout blow,'' Glosson said. ``If we do, we will not see
American men and women fighting a ground war in the Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over whether air power alone can coerce a foe is a
key issue now because of President Clinton's promise this week not
to dispatch ground troops to fight Yugoslav forces. Clinton said he
would send U.S. troops only to act as peacekeepers once a treaty is
signed between Milosevic and the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Clinton's strategy insist that air power had its
limits in the Gulf War, in which the United States and its allies
pounded Iraqi positions from the skies for 43 days.
</P>
<P>
   While the massive attacks destroyed equipment and killed enemy
troops, Iraq relinquished its grip on Kuwait only when thousands of
allied troops swept through the region.
</P>
<P>
   A House Armed Services Committee report after the war said,
``The air campaign did not force Saddam (Hussein) to withdraw, and
despite its military effectiveness, did not lead to his overthrow.
Consequently, valid questions remain about the limits of air power
to achieve largely political goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's official report to Congress on the Gulf War
concluded that ``air power alone could not have brought the war to
so sharp and decisive a conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   It added, ``Without the credible threat of ground and amphibious
attacks, the Iraqi defenders might have dispersed, dug in more
deeply, concentrated in civilian areas or otherwise adopted a
strategy of outlasting the bombing from the air.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam War also shows that years of strategic bombing
against Vietcong targets failed to assure victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``American civilian and military leaders entered Vietnam
convinced that bombing's lethality assured political results,''
wrote Air Force scholar Mark Clodfelter in ``The Limits of Air
Power.''
</P>
<P>
   What they learned was that ``air power is unlikely to provide
... `victory' in a guerrilla war,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the U.S. military after World War II said allied
bombing of German targets succeeded in terrorizing Nazi officials.
But it noted that the attacks by 12,000 B-17s and more than 10,000
RAF bombers were not accurate enough to destroy Germany's
production capability or the morale of its citizens.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not unusual for businesspeople with a common background to
join together to promote economic development and entrepreneurship
in their community, forming groups like the Asian American Business
Development Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Now these groups are finding that they can magnify their
effectiveness by banding together into minority-group coalitions, a
move encouraged by the Minority Business Development Agency of the
Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Courtland Cox, the director of the agency, was in New York last
week for the release of a research report by the Asian center. The
report calls for greater economic collaboration among Asian,
Hispanic, African-American and other minority groups, who together
command $1.1 trillion in consumer purchasing power, according to
John Wang, the center's president.
</P>
<P>
   Cox discussed the report's findings and the challenges of
minority business development. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you see small-business development and entrepreneurship as
the best route out of poverty? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. The real issues minorities face are economic rather than
social. People try to deal with illegitimacy and crime and drug
addiction, but these are the effects, not the root causes, of
problems. It is important to develop a business and economic
infrastructure that can deal with the real issues of jobs, economic
development and the creation of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   When I look at a map of where murders take place in Washington,
basically it is east of 16th Street Northwest, where there is more
poverty and higher unemployment. There are almost no murders west
of 16th Street, where the wealth is. Where you have access to
opportunity, you have less crime.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a minority businessperson, it's an exciting time,
because you're in a dynamic growth area. The United States
population is expected to grow by 120 million people over the next
50 years, and 90 percent of that growth will be in the minority
community. If you look at where the markets for the future are,
it's clear that's where they will be. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does minority entrepreneurship translate directly into more
jobs for minority workers? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, the numbers will show you that. Recently I went up to
Detroit to see Bing Manufacturing. Dave Bing, the former basketball
player, has an automotive assembly operation that included 15
percent of employees who were ex-offenders, predominantly nonwhite.
Detroit also has Mexican Industries, a $300 million company that
has hired about 2,000 people, most of them Hispanic, who make parts
and do assembly work for GM, Ford Motor and Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   These are private-sector initiatives. A lot of big companies
realize that markets change and they have to include minorities,
not because it's nice or legal, but so that they can sell into the
market. IBM just created its first minority distributorship. These
guys aren't stupid. They want to be where markets are. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Researchers say lack of access to financing is a roadblock to
minority business creation, and the administration has responded
this year by proposing tax credits and government loan programs for
struggling inner-city areas. What should the private sector be
doing? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We need a mechanism for banks and other financial
institutions to sell off their loans to minority enterprises,
instead of waiting for them to mature before they can lend more
money. This was an important finding of the task force. There is
now much more mortgage money because banks are selling off
mortgages and securitizing them. We need to apply the same
principle to business loans. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Your agency is encouraging coalitions among different
minority groups, like the Minority Business Coordinating Council in
Washington. How far has this cooperation advanced? Will it be
hampered by past tensions between some groups? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This is a new concept, and it's just in the discussion
stages. We still have a ghetto mentality, where people fight over
crumbs. Many people still think the world is their block and don't
see the possibilities in the larger world. But I don't think groups
will be that far apart once they understand the opportunities that
exist. People are crossing all sorts of ethnic and national
boundaries, and business is more important than ethnic prejudices. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you agree with John Wang that in a global economy,
American entrepreneurs of Asian or Hispanic background may have an
advantage in dealing internationally? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. America has the diverse population to position itself
internationally. I have people in my office who have the feel for
different countries. In an international economy, we need people
who understand different languages and different cultures.

<P>
   HARLEM-RENAISSANCE-II (New York) _ Those who live in the 50 or
so blocks above Central Park like to term what's happening in the
area today Harlem's Second Renaissance, with the return of black
professionals, new businesses, increased tourism and a rebirth of
night life. While the term may be strained, it is not far from the
truth. Economic development, historical preservation and plummeting
crime rates in the area have contributed to a kind of boom. By Nina
Siegel. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AERIN-LAUDER-PROFILE (New York) _ Ms. Aerin Lauder, 28, is that
rarest of Park Avenue princesses: a hyperactive member of junior
society by night, and by day, a working woman who is being groomed
for the executive suite of one of the country's largest companies:
Estee Lauder. By Ruth La Ferla. Photo. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STYLISH-AIR-TRAVEL (Undated) _ There is no greater indignity
than commercial air travel. Multi-hour delays are imposed without
apology or extra peanuts. Flight attendants have all the charm of
hall monitors. The term ``jet set'' now means a matching sweat-suit
ensemble. The plummeting dress code on your average 737 may sound
like a superficial gripe in the larger context of crippling pilot
strikes and $4 headsets. But I would argue that the relentless
unstylishness of the in-flight experience is the problem, from
barefoot passengers to the cabin crew's Salvation Army-drab
uniforms to the goats and chickens roaming around the back of the
plane. By Rick Marin. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CLERGY-WOMEN-FASHION (New York) _ Women who are spiritual
leaders, one might imagine, would be too preoccupied with crises of
faith to concern themselves with crises of fashion. But many of
those who are rabbis and ministers are careful not to overlook
matters like nail polish, hem lengths, heel heights and hair color.
By Elizabeth Hayt. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ Although cherry tomatoes existed in
Europe as long ago as 1623, they have always been relatively
unimportant, grown mostly for curiosity or for pickles and
preserves. Nowadays, most of the crop turns up in salad bars, and
then because they do not need slicing. By Lee Reich. &QL;

   If that sounded unforgiving, what happened next was like a gift
from the gods. Each man got a haircut and grooming tips from
professional stylists with the Red Salon, an upscale chain, and
each received about $1,700 worth of business clothing, including a
trench coat, a suit, a dress shirt, a tie, a Coach watch and a pair
of socks and Rockport shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The items were donated by the manufacturers and distributed by a
new nonprofit organization called Career Gear that so far has
raised just $4,000 toward its projected annual budget of $235,000.
</P>
<P>
   David C. Woolard, 40, the vice chairman of Career Gear and a
costume designer, fitted each job candidate individually before
sending the suits to an express tailor shop for free alterations.
As Woolard pinned his sleeve, Mikhail Murodov, an economist from
Uzbekistan, said: ``I'm feeling very emotional right now! So many
people helping so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Another participant, Samine Gibson of the Bronx, was having his
beard trimmed. ``I feel like a million bucks,'' exulted Gibson, who
wants to enter music engineering. ``It's my first suit since I was
little. It makes me want to go out and get a job right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the men had their pictures taken. Brian Gurganious, a
former postal clerk and a single parent of two girls, struck a pose
and said, ``I don't know why, but I can't stop smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   The American economy may be a giant job machine these days, with
unemployment falling to 30-year lows and labor shortages developing
in many parts of the country, but many employers still shun job
seekers they view as undesirables. These include unskilled workers,
recent immigrants and people who have coped with personal or family
traumas.
</P>
<P>
   It is for them that Career Gear was formed late last year. Its
simple premise is that a job seeker can greatly increase his
chances of landing a job if he wears crisp business attire to the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The psychology of clothing is very important in our society,''
Woolard said. ``Judgments are made in the first five seconds. When
these guys put on a new suit, it's like putting on a suit of
armor.''
</P>
<P>
   Other groups, like Dress for Success in New York and the
Bottomless Closet in Chicago, have provided ``interview
appropriate'' clothing to women for years. Now, the movement is
crossing the gender border with the formation of groups like Career
Gear in New York and the Street Clothes Project in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Career Gear was founded in October by Gary L. Field, 39, who
recently quit his job as director of services for the National
Alliance for the Mentally Ill in New York to devote all his
attention to the project. Field said the need to teach the
chronically unemployed the ins and outs of job-hunting has
intensified with the spread of workfare programs aimed at moving
people off welfare and into paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the people on welfare are totally unprepared to make
the transition into a professional environment,'' he said. He added
that he hopes to build a network of peers and mentors to help his
clients cope with workplace problems and ``deal with tricky things
like office politics.''
</P>
<P>
   People are referred to Career Gear after learning job-seeking
skills _ like how to write a resume and answer interview questions
_ at work-readiness programs including the Employment Training
Program for Recovering Alcoholics, the Metropolitan Council on
Jewish Poverty and the Federation of Employment and Guidance
Services.
</P>
<P>
   Today, two months after their makeover, some members of Career
Gear's first class have found work while others are still looking.
Gurganious, the single father, is one of the lucky ones, finding
employment as a hardware store clerk. ``I wore my suit to the
interview, and I guess it worked,'' he said. ``This job makes me
feel like a brand-new person. The suit is my good-luck charm. It
stays in the closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Waytes, a fellow alumnus and former co-owner of a
multimedia production company who said he has struggled with
addictions, jail time and homelessness, landed a job at a
mental-health clinic. ``When you've been out of work, it's
frightening to look for a job,'' he said. ``My self-esteem was low.
It's amazing how a change of clothes can make you feel so much more
optimistic and confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Field knows how these men feel. Once addicted to drugs and
alcohol himself, he said, he joined a program for recovering
alcoholics, bought a $50 suit at a thrift store and regained
control of his life. At 37, he graduated from New York University
with a master's degree in social work, and eventually volunteered
at Dress for Success. At the urging of Woolard, he created a
similar program for men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand our clients because I am them,'' Field. ``I tell
them I should have been dead by age 30, and I say, `If I can do it,
so can you.'''

   POACHED EGGS AND FRIED TOMATOES WITH CREAMY HAM SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup coarse yellow cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound well-trimmed firm, smoky ham, cut into 1/4-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme, plus thyme sprigs for garnish,
optional
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   2 large, firm ripe tomatoes, cut into 8 thick slices
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   8 eggs
</P>
<P>
   4 thick English muffins, split and lightly toasted
</P>
<P>
   On a plate, stir together cornmeal and 1/2 teaspoon of the
pepper. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In small, heavy saucepan over medium heat, combine cream, ham
and minced thyme. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer
uncovered, stirring once or twice, until reduced to 1 cup, about 20
minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice and remaining 1/2
teaspoon pepper. Cover and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   In large skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Dredge tomatoes
in prepared cornmeal and fry in the skillet, turning once, until
lightly browned and crisp, about 4 minutes per side.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, to a deep skillet, add water to a depth of 2 inches.
Set over medium heat and bring just to a simmer. Stir in salt. One
at a time, break eggs into small dish and then slide them into
water. Adjust heat to keep water from exceeding a simmer and cook
the eggs, gently shaping them into ovals with a spoon, to the
desired doneness, about 3 minutes for medium-firm.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange 2 muffin halves on each of 4 plates. Top each half with
1 fried tomato slice. With slotted spoon, remove eggs from water,
blot briefly on paper towels and set an egg atop each tomato slice.
Spoon cream sauce over and around eggs and muffins, garnish each
serving with a sprig of thyme if desired and serve immediately.

THE DRUG-TEST TIGHTROPE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 28) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Ariz.)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My company is instituting random drug testing, and my fellow
managers and I are trying to decide how strict to be. For safety
reasons, we figure that a factory worker who tests positive should
be severely penalized or dismissed, but that such punishment seems
extreme for secretaries and midlevel managers. How can we be both
fair and effective? And what is the best way to present the new
rules to employees? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you don't know your state's laws on this subject, find
out. Random testing is often perceived as being more invasive and
offensive than other kinds, said Jonathan Segal, a partner in the
employment department of Wolf, Block, Schorr &AMP; Solis-Cohen, a
Philadelphia law firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, some states by statute restrict random testing
only to safety-sensitive positions,'' Segal said, ``while others
restrict it by case law.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even if there are no legal restrictions, your
employees may not be thrilled _ and may think that you are morphing
into Big Brother. To avoid a revolt, experts say, sell the policy
as a way to protect employees' safety and financial interests as
well as the company's.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Johnson, a spokesman for SmithKline Beecham Clinical
Laboratories, which is one of the nation's largest providers of
workplace drug tests, suggests talking about how drug use raises a
company's insurance rates, harms productivity and increases
workplace accidents.
</P>
<P>
   To alleviate concerns about possible abuses, invite employees to
ask questions about who will conduct the test and how _ and who
will have access to results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assure them that it really will be random,'' Segal said,
noting that some workers think supervisors use such policies to
retaliate against underlings they don't like. ``Make it clear that
the goal isn't to `get' people.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Segal said, ``often some companies will defer testing
for 60 or 90 days and tell people, `In the interim, if you think
you have a problem, seek help.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Consistency is the key in enforcement. ``Spell out the
repercussions for anyone using drugs,'' said Susan Jones, director
of Drugs Don't Work in Arizona, a nonprofit organization in Phoenix
that helps area businesses establish antidrug programs.
</P>
<P>
   Although you may not be legally obligated to take identical
disciplinary action against offenders from different divisions,
Segal said, separate rules for manufacturing or engineering on the
one hand and for management or support staff on the other could
undermine employees' faith in the policy. ``You would create a
double standard that could become a morale issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies suspend all first-time offenders automatically.
Then they are required to undergo an assessment by a
substance-abuse specialist and to abide by the specialist's
recommendations as a condition of returning to work. That allows
both a uniform policy and a diversity of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   And regardless of whether an employee is a marketing executive
or a truck driver, if he tests positive a second time, you may
decide it's best to send him packing. &QL;

<P>
   If there is any time of year that most of us would love to skip,
this is it. Taxes are due in less than three weeks, and only two
weekends remain for us to lock ourselves away and get the chore
done. The pressure is on.
</P>
<P>
   Although the amount of taxes we pay is cause for much debate,
the time required to prepare the forms can be just as vexatious. Of
the estimated 126.2 million individual tax returns that will be
filed this year, almost half will be completed by taxpayers
themselves, not accountants. And even those who use professional
help must spend many hours compiling their records.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it is a big job. And the burden falls hardest on
baby boomers. According to the Tax Foundation, a research
organization in Washington, boomers will pay 70 percent of the
$877.4 billion tax bill for individuals this year.
</P>
<P>
   And, because their finances tend to be complex, the foundation
estimates that they will spend about a third more time preparing
Form 1040 and its many schedules than the average American _ 40
hours instead of 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are at the peak of their earnings and have children and
houses,'' said Patrick Fleenor, a foundation economist. ``Younger
and older people tend to have much simpler filings.''
</P>
<P>
   That raises questions beyond whether the tax system is fair.
Considering that boomers, now into middle age, are at the height of
their earning power, creativity and productivity, there must be a
social cost in forcing them to spend millions of hours a year at
their kitchen tables trying to maneuver through the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity cost of the time they're spending is very
large,'' said James M. Buchanan of George Mason University, winner
of the 1987 Nobel Prize in economics. ``It's a waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleenor called it ``brilliance lost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the whole reason tax reform proposals have weight,''
he said. ``Tax preparation doesn't add anything to society's worth.
Nothing positive is coming out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, no way to measure what could have been;
would boomers really use the extra time more productively, or would
we just lie around listening to old Beatles albums? But we can
measure the opportunity noted by Buchanan. The Tax Foundation
estimates that the time Americans spend doing their taxes robs the
economy of $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A taxpayer in Malibu, Calif., who requested anonymity, said he
spent about 90 hours on his taxes. Throughout the year, he said, he
is meticulous about record-keeping because he runs a business out
of his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have several careers,'' he said. ``One of them is doing my
taxes. It's a tremendous waste of my time. I should be spending it
with my family or out making more money.''
</P>
<P>
   David P. Mulford, a computer programmer and musician in St.
Louis, said he usually puts off doing his taxes until April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dread doing them more than I do paying'' the taxes owed, he
said. ``It's such a headache. When I get home from work, I don't
want to spend three or four hours doing my taxes. I want to visit
with friends or work on my music.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said he was a recent convert to proposals for a
simple-to-calculate flat tax, with no deductions. Others critics of
the current system are calling for a national sales tax. And the
other day a friend jokingly suggested requiring high-school juniors
to fill out the nation's tax returns, giving the youngsters the
chance to make their math skills relevant while freeing up time for
their elders.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that everyone has an idea for cleaning up the tax mess,
but as Fleenor observed, the history of the tax-overhaul movement
is not reassuring. Within years of any move to simplify the
process, he said, Congress bows to special interests and
complicates it all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people are just playing around with the tax code, trying
to find ways to avoid paying taxes, they are not engaged in
creating wealth,'' he said. ``People's time could be much better
spent inventing the better mousetrap.''
</P>
<P>
   Or the better tax system.

<P>
   PARIS _ Nissan can certainly use Renault's help to straighten
out its bleak and tangled finances. But it could also stand a nudge
at the drawing board, some auto industry analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan products are ``obsolete, out of date,'' said Gregoire Van
de Velde, an automotive consultant in Detroit. ``The styling is
much too conservative worldwide.'' Van de Velde, president of
Automotive Strategy, added, ``Renault has the capacity to bring
Nissan what it is missing.'' He spoke as Renault, of France, was
preparing to sign an agreement to buy 35 percent of Nissan, Japan's
No. 2 auto maker, after Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   For almost 20 years, Nissan's strategy was to match Toyota
product for product but to do a better job of execution. It ended
up with the most efficient factories in Europe, at Sunderland,
England, and in the United States, at Smyrna, Tenn. _ along with a
series of me-too cars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The symptom is that Nissan doesn't make money,'' said Nigel
Griffith, an analyst for Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI in London. ``The
cause is that Nissan doesn't have a strong brand image.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's often-bland cars aim to please everyone, so ``any
consumer, in any part of the car market, is going to have another
proposition that's closer to the unique features that he's looking
for,'' Griffith added.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Renault's designs are widely admired, even
though the company no longer sells cars in North America. ``Renault
seems to have taken over the role of design innovation which used
to belong to Citroen,'' said David Browne, manager of the
transportation design program at Coventry University in England.
``Citroen, in its glory days, finished up with products that people
both loved and feared.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That has also been Renault's secret. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to please some people,'' Patrick Le Quement, Renault's
vice president for design and quality, said last month at the
introduction of the striking Avantime concept car. ``Our aim is
(italics) not (end italics) to not displease people.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Le Quement sent teams of designers to London,
Barcelona and Milan to observe people and trends. Then the staff
tried to envision what people will need in a few years, and create
it for them if it doesn't yet exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a history of being good at coming up with trend
setters,'' Le Quement said. Renault established new segments with
the European minivan (Espace, 1984), microcar (Twingo, 1992),
compact minivan (Scenic, 1996) and small passenger van (Kangoo,
1997). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the Netherlands, a spokesman for Nissan Europe, Clyde
Moerlie, defended Nissan's talents. ``We don't agree that our cars
are boring,'' he said. ``The Micra is the only Japanese car to ever
win European Car of the Year, in 1993. The face lift last year had
record sales.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 1970-75 Datsun 240Z was the first Japanese sports car to win
a big following, and the Nissan Pathfinder of 1986 was ahead of the
sport utility craze. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Nissan was there at the right time, but they didn't follow
through,'' said Philippe Houchois, another Standard and Poor's DRI
analyst in London. He said he thought that Renault's money was more
important than its creativity. ``Nissan themselves, they know what
to do,'' he said. ``They've identified the problems.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in showing off more innovative designs in recent months,
the president of Nissan Design International in San Diego, Jerry
Hirshberg, has said that ``there's nothing like a good jolt of fear
to release the creative juices.'' A clever city car design from
Nissan Design Europe, the Kyxx _ pronounced kicks _ was a highlight
of the Paris auto show in October. In Japan, the compact Cube
wagon-minivan has sold well.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between Renault and Nissan may be more in the
execution than in the intention. Some of Renault's design strength,
said Browne of Coventry University, derives from the fact that Le
Quement is a senior executive, and thus ``at the highest levels, he
argues for the importance of innovative design and creative
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   At Nissan, on the other hand, American managers routinely talk
about innovative proposals delayed in Japan, or bold strokes
reduced to staid designs. As a result, the company did not keep up
with American tastes; it is only now bringing out a small sport
utility, the Xterra, years behind Toyota and Honda.

TINY SMART BY DAIMLER SLIPS AFTER FAST START 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich.)   (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

<P>
   PARIS _ Smart cars are struggling to live up to their name.
DaimlerChrysler's Micro Compact Car Smart subsidiary has reduced
1999 sales goals to 100,000, from 130,000, and plans to close the
factory in Strasbourg, France, for two weeks next month.
</P>
<P>
   And in an effort to reach its new goal, Smart has cut prices,
added equipment and planned a three-month ad campaign. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Switzerland is doing better than expected, and Germany is
doing well,'' said Hans-Jurg Schar, the executive vice-president
for marketing and sales at Micro Compact Car Smart, ``but we have
to really improve in Italy and France.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This month, Smart added $275 of equipment to the basic car,
including seat cushions, a 12-volt plug for accessories, better
glass and a hand grip for the passenger. Prices were cut by $900,
to a base price in Italy and France of about $9,300. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smart has had two basic marketing problems: a stiff ride and a
high price. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The colors are fresh, and everybody stops to look,'' said
Corinne Fleuet, manager of an Avis car rental agency in Paris. Her
fleet of five cars is rented every weekend (for about $75 a day) by
curious Parisiens, she said. ``Many of them say they want to buy
one, until they learn the price.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Schar concedes that Smart buyers complain about the
``price-value'' relationship, even though many have high incomes
and already own one or two cars. ``And in Germany and France the
suspension is an issue,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hard ride is a result of changes made a year ago to keep the
car stable during high-speed lane changes. Sales began in October.
Despite negative reviews of the suspension in the automotive press,
Smart reached its 1998 sales goal of 20,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But sales slowed in January; in February Smarts were involved in
several minor but widely publicized accidents on snowy German
roads. Avis halted rentals in Germany for several weeks until the
cars were fitted with snow tires. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The news had no effect on sales, Schar said, but it was another
hitch. ``We presumed that drivers would stay away from the
accelerator in unstable driving situations,'' said Helmut Wawra,
development director for the Smart. But they didn't, so engineers
will add a software package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust Plus'' will cut power to the wheels if they start to
slip. Smart already had a stability control that selectively
applied the anti-lock brakes to prevent spinouts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Le Quement, vice president for design at Renault, says
the whole idea of a two-seater more expensive than Renault's
four-seat Twingo is an aberration. The Smart, he said in an
interview in Renault's in-house magazine ``Avec'' this month, is a
phenomenon of fashion aimed at people who want to drive something
different. And, he quoted the artist Jean Cocteau, ``Nothing goes
out of fashion as quickly as fashion.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, J. Mays, vice president for design at Ford, was
kinder. Although he has driven the car, he would not comment on its
ride. But, he said, ``I think the size of the vehicle is really
nice.''

LONG-RANGE WARFARE IS GOOD; LONG-RANGE PLANS ARE BETTER

<P>
   ``What a world, what a world.''
</P>
<P>
   _ the Wicked Witch of the West, ``The Wizard of Oz''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   What a world, indeed, and here the United States sits, depending
on an administration that couldn't buy the right vowel to complete
``-xit strat-gy'' even if you spot it the other letters.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is finally bombing the Serbs, trying to force Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to stop the slaughter in Kosovo and to
play nice in a region that has suffered from sporadic ethnic-based
conflicts for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong; I thought President Clinton should have
given the green light last month when the initial deadline passed
while parties on both sides of the battle were vamping for time in
Rambuillet, France. The only thing different between then and
Wednesday afternoon, when the first alliance munitions finally hit
Yugoslav dirt, was the number of ethnic Albanians whom Milosevic
had killed or made into refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But then, as now, I'd have felt a whole lot better about
airstrikes over the Ottoman if the United States and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization had some kind of plan for what happens
if, heaven forbid, the Butcher of Belgrade doesn't back down.
</P>
<P>
   The reason why stability in that region of the world is
important to the United States is a no-brainer _ one look at a map
should be enough to convince even the most ardent isolationist that
it is not in this country's best interest to allow ethnic warfare
to spill beyond Serbia's borders.
</P>
<P>
   Add in our obligations to our 18 NATO allies, some of whom are
nervously watching from close proximity as thousands of refugees
urgently seek a new place to call home, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to know that although the United States is
rushing to the aid of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the underarmed
and undermanned underdog in this conflict, its members aren't
exactly choirboys.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of sordid past and unsavory tactics to go around.
But the leaders of the KLA ultimately accepted a peace agreement
even though it didn't give them the independence they so
desperately want _ a sign that they were willing to consider a
diplomatic solution over continued aggression. Milosevic just dug
in his heels, refusing to accept the provision that would require
NATO troops in his country to enforce the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to the original question: What happens
next? So NATO lays down two or three weeks of intensive airstrikes
on Belgrade and Pristina, and Milosevic continues his assault on
Kosovo. In fact, the bombing just ticks him off even more, and he
intensifies his bloody campaign to annihilate the ethnic Albanians.
What's the plan then, Mr. President?
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, supreme commander of NATO forces,
said yesterday that ``the operation will be just as long and
difficult as President Milosevic requires it to be.'' Possible
translation: ground troops needed to close the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Although the risks of bombing campaigns for the personnel flying
the missions are very real, airstrikes are low-risk military
maneuvers in the minds of the American people. Shoot, we've been
throwing armament at Iraqi targets since December, and the
near-daily exchanges over the no-fly zones barely make news briefs
anymore. Technology has made air combat impersonal _ at least until
the first fresh-faced kid from Kansas comes home in a box. Then
watch Americans take things extremely personally.
</P>
<P>
   Air campaigns historically have not been successful in closing
the deal. Without question, the bombing sorties flown over Iraq
during Operation Desert Storm made a huge impression on Saddam
Hussein _ actually, they made a bigger impression on the Iraqi
Republican Guard as it was being turned to glass _ but it took
troops on the ground to achieve the definitive push out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton keeps saying that he does not intend to put U.S. troops
in Kosovo to fight a war, even when his top military gurus are
making noise otherwise. But then, this wouldn't be the first time
that Clinton's lips did one thing and his actions were something
quite different.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's army is trained and equipped beyond Saddam's wildest
dreams. Don't expect to see photographs of Serbian military men
waving white flags and surrendering in the numbers that the world
witnessed in Iraq. This won't be a lay-down.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has moral, economic, allied and security
reasons for taking action in Yugoslavia. But it would have been
nice, just once, if Clinton had a long-range plan going into this
war instead of doing his typical
``let's-just-wait-to-see-what-happens'' routine.

RACETRACK ON THE BAY SEEKS TO REVIVE ITS FORTUNE

<P>
   ALBANY, Calif. _ We're certainly living in a world different
from that of 1947, when 30,000 or more people would show up at
Golden Gate Fields for a day of racing.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some things of value endure through the years: the
cluster of beautiful horses in the paddock, the jockeys in bright
silks, the thrill of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Such images, along with others showing jockeys at familiar San
Francisco settings, are jammed into a 30-second prime-time
television commercial to be shown Tuesday through Friday on network
stations in the San Francisco area. It's a major advertising
investment of more than $1 million for the track that has been
losing customers.
</P>
<P>
   Average daily attendance over approximately 100 days of racing
is not much more than 3,000 now, for a host of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them is the 1985 introduction of off-track betting
in California, making a trip to Albany, on the east side of the San
Francisco Bay, unnecessary. Other reasons include heady competition
for entertainment and gambling dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get the message out that it's affordable; it's fun;
it's safe, clean and exciting. It's traditional,'' said Doug
Nelson, vice president of MGO Marketing Group of Lafayette, serving
as consultants to Golden Gate Fields as it prepares for its season
opener on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And customers have a vested interest in the outcome if they have
placed a bet, said Jill Borden, Golden Gate Fields' director of
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, average daily attendance at the track along the San
Francisco Bay has fallen 40 percent in the past decade. The TV
spot, along with a print ad campaign and a 60-second radio
commercial _ all clearly aimed at people who have a lot of
disposable income and an interest in the swing era _ aim to reverse
that trend.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, there's no reference to gambling in the ads
created by a Newport Beach-based production company, Lyon Studios,
although winning is everything for many people who go to the races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I like to play that down, but for me the thrill
of it all is the racetrack experience,'' said agency owner Curt
Lyon, who also creates advertising for Santa Anita in Arcadia, a
track that can actually claim it has staunched the drain of
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Its attendance went up 1 percent in 1998 after 12 consecutive
years of decline, said Craig Dado, the track's vice president for
marketing. Of course, Santa Anita also invested heavily in
marketing programs in part to identify its customers and people
like them: They're men over 35 with money in their pockets and time
on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track will probably not appeal to you without those
elements,'' Dado said.
</P>
<P>
   From 1985, when off-track or satellite betting was introduced in
California, to 1987, there were only two facilities in Northern
California housing the necessary equipment _ Golden Gate Fields and
Bay Meadows in San Mateo. In 1987, though, other off-track sites
opened, and Golden Gate Fields' average daily attendance plummeted
from 12,773 in 1987 to 6,890 the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shows you the need to do something,'' said Sam Spear, the
veteran media relations director at Golden Gate Fields.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are satellite betting facilities, open 108 days a
year, at Anderson, Bakersfield, Bay Meadows, Eureka, Fresno,
Monterey, Pleasanton, Sacramento, San Jose, Santa Rosa, Stockton,
Tulare, Turlock and Vallejo.
</P>
<P>
   Racetracks knew that when they supported off-track betting, they
would lose live customers, said Peter Tunney, Golden Gate Fields'
vice president and general manager. ``But we also knew we had to
make it more convenient for people to keep them as regulars _ to
open up those (satellite facilities) that are closer to where they
might live and work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we suspected that it was going to have some drain,'' Tunney
said. ``I think that about the time we started simulcasting, there
was also a nationwide depletion of attendance at racetracks, so we
got hit with a double whammy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyon and the management of the 58-year-old track hope to make up
some of the loss with the new campaign, which is centered on the
theme: ``Where the Bay Comes to Play.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad speaks of a ``pageant of power, tradition and
heart-pounding thrills'' and weaves scenes of a horse being
saddled, a nose-to-nose race and postcard-like images of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Gate Fields, owned by British-based Ladbroke Racing, a
major owner of betting shops in Britain, thinks its opening day
program Wednesday will draw a crowd. It's running the richest race
in the country that day, the $125,000 Berkeley Handicap, featuring
Cavonnier, a gelding reared in Sebastopol that lost the 1996
Kentucky Derby by a nose to Grindstone.

is not much more than 3,000 now, for a host of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them is the 1985 introduction of off-track betting
in California, making a trip to Albany, on the east side of the San
Francisco Bay, unnecessary. Other reasons include heady competition
for entertainment and gambling dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get the message out that it's affordable; it's fun;
it's safe, clean and exciting. It's traditional,'' said Doug
Nelson, vice president of MGO Marketing Group of Lafayette, serving
as consultants to Golden Gate Fields as it prepares for its season
opener on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And customers have a vested interest in the outcome if they have
placed a bet, said Jill Borden, Golden Gate Fields' director of
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, average daily attendance at the track along the San
Francisco Bay has fallen 40 percent in the past decade. The TV
spot, along with a print ad campaign and a 60-second radio
commercial _ all clearly aimed at people who have a lot of
disposable income and an interest in the swing era _ aim to reverse
that trend.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, there's no reference to gambling in the ads
created by a Newport Beach-based production company, Lyon Studios,
although winning is everything for many people who go to the races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I like to play that down, but for me the thrill
of it all is the racetrack experience,'' said agency owner Curt
Lyon, who also creates advertising for Santa Anita in Arcadia, a
track that can actually claim it has staunched the drain of
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Its attendance went up 1 percent in 1998 after 12 consecutive
years of decline, said Craig Dado, the track's vice president for
marketing. Of course, Santa Anita also invested heavily in
marketing programs in part to identify its customers and people
like them: They're men over 35 with money in their pockets and time
on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track will probably not appeal to you without those
elements,'' Dado said.
</P>
<P>
   From 1985, when off-track or satellite betting was introduced in
California, to 1987, there were only two facilities in Northern
California housing the necessary equipment _ Golden Gate Fields and
Bay Meadows in San Mateo. In 1987, though, other off-track sites
opened, and Golden Gate Fields' average daily attendance plummeted
from 12,773 in 1987 to 6,890 the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shows you the need to do something,'' said Sam Spear, the
veteran media relations director at Golden Gate Fields.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are satellite betting facilities, open 108 days a
year, at Anderson, Bakersfield, Bay Meadows, Eureka, Fresno,
Monterey, Pleasanton, Sacramento, San Jose, Santa Rosa, Stockton,
Tulare, Turlock and Vallejo.
</P>
<P>
   Racetracks knew that when they supported off-track betting, they
would lose live customers, said Peter Tunney, Golden Gate Fields'
vice president and general manager. ``But we also knew we had to
make it more convenient for people to keep them as regulars _ to
open up those (satellite facilities) that are closer to where they
might live and work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we suspected that it was going to have some drain,'' Tunney
said. ``I think that about the time we started simulcasting, there
was also a nationwide depletion of attendance at racetracks, so we
got hit with a double whammy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyon and the management of the 58-year-old track hope to make up
some of the loss with the new campaign, which is centered on the
theme: ``Where the Bay Comes to Play.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad speaks of a ``pageant of power, tradition and
heart-pounding thrills'' and weaves scenes of a horse being
saddled, a nose-to-nose race and postcard-like images of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Gate Fields, owned by British-based Ladbroke Racing, a
major owner of betting shops in Britain, thinks its opening day
program Wednesday will draw a crowd. It's running the richest race
in the country that day, the $125,000 Berkeley Handicap, featuring
Cavonnier, a gelding reared in Sebastopol that lost the 1996
Kentucky Derby by a nose to Grindstone.

 &HT;    PARIS _ Talking about Kosovo, an unnamed foreign policy adviser
to President Bill Clinton pointed out, ``There are massive
bloodbaths all over the world and we're not intervening in them.
...(But) this one's in the heart of Europe.''
 &HT;    Nobody could say the United States was straining at the leash to
blast Serb forces. Nobody could say that it failed to support an
effort for a political solution or that it charged alone without
full consultation and participation of allies.
 &HT;    In fact, the West's reluctance to resort to force has been made
clear at every step since Slobodan Milosevic launched an armed
campaign against the Kosovars a year ago, so much so that NATO came
under severe criticism for ``bluffing'' on its intention to bomb.
 &HT;    And yet, by any conventional definition of international rules,
the attack is an act of aggression against a sovereign state.
Further, Serbia argues that the West has it all wrong, that
actually Serb troops and police are only putting down rebellious
terrorists within their own borders and, what's more, it's nobody
else's business.
 &HT;    That argument doesn't hold today. The new air strikes do show a
profound change in the Euro-American community, a change in
attitude, analysis and ambition. During the war in Bosnia,
government leaders were ridiculed and maligned for failing to stop
the massacres; repeatedly they vowed to do something, waffled and
backed down.
 &HT;    This time we were told again and again that the Western powers
could not simply sit on their hands and let it happen again. Not to
intervene would be a form of collusion with repression _ with the
scorched-earth, ethnic cleansing policy of Milosevic.
 &HT;    The decision to act, not to tolerate a repetition of Bosnia,
shows the gradual evolution of a sense of responsibility,
humanitarian obligation, political need and moral duty. When the
Serbian parliament learned its only choice was to admit foreign
troops to impose peace in Kosovo or be bombed, a question was
raised: Why bomb?
 &HT;    The answer is that there is a new consensus that limits must be
set on outrageous national behavior. Those limits haven't yet been
strictly defined, but they are being drawn now.
 &HT;    At first, France had insisted that action could be taken only
with a U.N. Security Council mandate. But this was impossible
because Russia, which has a veto, is opposed to any attack on
Serbia. That left the question _ how many civilians have to die to
passthe threshold of circumstance? There have already been too
many, France has concluded, and it announced full participation in
the NATO military plan.
 &HT;    There is currently a kind of interim stage in the understanding
of state relations and the meaning of that somewhat vaporous group
called ``the international community.'' The old rule of ``hands off
the neighbor's affairs'' is no longer acceptable. Likewise, the
axiom that ``you can't keep the peace until belligerents are tired
of fighting and want to quit'' is being rejected.
 &HT;    When and where allied intervention is justified, indeed
required, and how to go about it remain intensely controversial.
There aren't any new rules yet but there is a firm convergence in
judging that Kosovo, now, is a case in point. It will set a
precedent.
 &HT;    There are all kinds of risks, not only military and of widening
the war. Relations with Russia will be seriously set back, and this
will affect pending agreements on nuclear arms control as well as
controversial sales of missiles to Iran. The very fate of NATO is
being challenged.
 &HT;    No doubt Moscow would not have minded seeing NATO weakened by
inaction and internal dispute, but it isn't happening. When they
thought it over, the alliance members fixed on priorities. They
decided that because there is a real feeling of need for minimal
standards of how to treat people in Europe, a reaction must occur
when they are violated.
 &HT;    It doesn't matter that Yugoslavia is not directly threatening
any other recognized state. It is bad for the neighborhood. To
punish Milosovic for that is a big step beyond tradition, and the
decision will cast a serious shadow on the argument about NATO's
new mandate. Nobody likes making America ``the global policeman,''
but neither can Europe ignore troubles in its region.
 &HT;    Why do only European conflicts get the benefit of this new
maturing responsibility for peace? Is it a sign of racism to ignore
those other bloodbaths? Maybe. However, Europe's willingness with
America to act at last is surely a sign that people can change,
that this continent has had its fill of wars. It's a shame to have
to bomb to prove it, but it must be proved.

KOSOVO: ANOTHER QUAGMIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When President Clinton bombed suspected terrorist enclaves and
launched military action against Iraq last year, his detractors
accused him of using the nation's armed forces to distract the
public's attention from developments in the presidential sex
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Impossible, said his defenders. The president of the United
States would never do such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   I sided with the defenders, for I was certain that not even a
dishonest, dishonorable, self-serving worm like Clinton would abuse
his power as commander in chief for the sake of crass political
gamesmanship. I likewise reject the current argument _ compelling
though it is _ that Clinton has committed the United States to
airstrikes against Yugoslavia for no reason but to enhance his
eventual standing in the history books.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, if the military adventure in the Balkans is as
risky as most experts say it is, it could doom Clinton to a legacy
of recklessness and failure. The president must know that this
whole deal could blow up in his face.
</P>
<P>
   If it's his legacy he's concerned about, Clinton would be better
off searching for a way to save Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   So let's assume that the president of the United States has led
the world's lone remaining superpower into the quicksand of a
European civil war because he believes it's the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   The question then becomes: What in the world makes him think
that this terrible misuse of American firepower is right, either as
a matter of principle or as a matter of sensible foreign policy?
</P>
<P>
   There was a reason why Clinton's predecessor George Bush refused
to entangle the United States in the ethnic, religious and
political turmoil that has plagued Bosnia, Kosovo, Serbia, et al.,
for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The reason was: The region is a quagmire, a self-destructive
blight on the face of the earth whose problems have nothing to do
with the national security interests of America.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rationalizes U.S. involvement _ as he rationalized our
endless ``peacekeeping'' mission in Bosnia _ by pointing out that
the brutal conflict in Kosovo is hard on the people who live there.
That's not foreign policy, folks; that's bleeding-heart
sentimentalism.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1995, Clinton sent troops to Bosnia _ for one year, he
said at the time. The troops are still there, with no prospect of
getting out. The U.S. military is, in effect, an occupying force in
a country that the United States doesn't want, doesn't need and has
no hope of controlling over a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Now Clinton bombs Yugoslavia because the United States doesn't
like its evil president, Slobodan Milosevic _ and the only apparent
objective of the bombing is to force Milosevic to allow foreign
troops to occupy his country.
</P>
<P>
   Our president is placing America's armed forces in jeopardy for
the purpose of winning the privilege of placing them in further
jeopardy as part of a NATO ``peacekeeping'' mission in Kosovo. At
this rate, the formerly communist Yugoslavia that had the audacity
to defy the Soviet Union will one day be an occupied colony of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, with U.S. soldiers as the
backbone of the occupying force.
</P>
<P>
   It's a horrible prospect, and a likely one if foreign policy
experts such as Henry Kissinger are accurately assessing the
probable outcome of the military action that began Wednesday and is
expected to conclude ... when? Nobody seems to know, including the
man who's supposed to be in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Clinton is trying to market his ill-advised policy
to the American people by explaining _ in sometimes condescending,
patronizing fashion, by the way _ the complexities of the
situation. And the more he talks about how complex it is, the more
he inadvertently makes the case for keeping the United States out
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Clinton is taking a calculated gamble here. If U.S.
involvement in the Balkans ultimately brings peace and stability to
the region, he will have achieved a remarkable and historic
victory.
</P>
<P>
   But the gamble is a long shot, and the stakes are American
lives. It's a lousy bet.

LET THE WINDOW WELLS DRAIN THE WATER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have window wells wih a U-shaped metal wall holding the
earth in position. I dug down three feet and filled the well with
crushed stone. Now the water does not overflow the well, but I am
getting some at the bottom of the foundation, where I think the
water is percolating downward in the well. How can I prevent that
seepage, which is only in the area of the window?
</P>
<P>
   J.S., Andover
</P>
<P>
   A. Good point. I think a cure is possible. Install a four-inch
PVC perforated pipe or similar pipe, as long as it is perforated,
below the crushed stone, or at the bottom of the crushed stone,
leading several feet horizontally, with a slight downward pitch,
outward from the well. You could improve things by building a small
dry well at the end of the pipe.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a good idea to put some polyethylene plastic at the
bottom of the crushed stone so the pipe will gather water and
deliver it to the dry well. If the dry well is far enough from the
house, water will percolate downward instead of into the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I tore out the bottom 20 inches of tile on my shower stall,
and installed concrete board, planning to put new tile on with
thin-set mortar. Trouble is, I can't find any tile to match the
old. They are 1 3/4 inches square.
</P>
<P>
   DANA GREEN, Corpus Christie, Tex.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are companies that offer old tile; in fact, old
everything, but I don't know of any in Texas. However, you could
call one of these companies that deal in old tile.
</P>
<P>
   General Flooring House of Carpets, of Weymouth, Mass.
781-337-3600, Vermont Salvage in Manchester, N.H., and White River
Junction, Vt. has old tile and metal ceiling tile, marble, and old
mantels and door hardware. Also, Colonial Floors in Framingham,
Mass.,
</P>
<P>
   has old everything.
</P>
<P>
   If this doesn't work, you have two chocies: 1. Remove the
remaining tile and install a new tile of your choice in the entire
stall. 2. Choose new tiles compatible in size and color with the
existing tile, and fill in with those.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Someone gave me two old, old-fashioned high chairs with
trays. They are wonderful, but the brackets are missing, and I
can't make the trays stay put. Is there a place that sells the
brackets? I'd hate to give up those chairs for the want of a
bracket or two.
</P>
<P>
   SANDY SCAFIDI, Sudbury
</P>
<P>
   A. Try the Woodworkers' Store, now called the Rockler
Woodworkers' Store (800-279-4441.) The catalog carries a lot of
things, including high chair hardware. Such hardware might work for
the high chairs. In fact, Sandy called later to say she called,
ordered, and received the brackets, which she said ``work
prefectly.''
</P>
<P>
   That is always nice to hear.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In redoing my basement, I did the walls with Blueboard and
plan to tape the joints and cover them with joint compound, and
also cover nail heads with joint compound, just as one would with
ordinary plasterboard (dry wall). I was told I can't do that. Why
not?
</P>
<P>
   RICK, from Medway
</P>
<P>
   A. He who told you that also should have told you why, but since
there was no reason, he couldn't give you a ``why.'' While
Blueboard is designed to take a skimcoat of plaster, filling joints
filled with a mesh tape, nail heads, and the whole wall with a
plaster skimcoat, there is no reason why you can't do what you plan
to do. The Blueboard has a sort of sandpaper finish to allow the
skimcoat to stick properly; that finish will also allow the joint
compound to stick better. Also, the Blueboard is more water
resistant then ordinary plasterboard.
</P>
<P>
   The only drawback might be this: The rough finish of the
Blueboard might contrast with the smooth finish of the joint
compound, making any paint coating uneven. A way around that is to
use a flat, not an eggshell, finish latex wall paint, which is more
likely to even out the finish.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I had a rubber roof installed on a shallow dormer roof three
years ago. The roof is great, no leaks or anything else, except
that ice slides down over the roof in great chunks, which I feel is
a hazard when they fall to the ground. How can I prevent that?
</P>
<P>
   LAILA DAMON, Concord
</P>
<P>
   A. Ice, and even snow, often causes hazards by plummeting over
the roof edges. It's the smoothness of the rubber roof that is
losing its grip on the ice (and/or snow). If the roof were rough,
like an asphalt shingle (with tiny stones on top to provide color
and protect the asphalt), there would be no sliding. The same thing
can happen with a slate roof.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why they invented snow hooks, fences or little
pylons on the roof to keep snow (and ice) from sliding off until it
melts. Two companies make them: 1. Vermont Slate &AMP; Copper Services

MOMENT OF TRUTH COMES TODAY FOR SEA LAUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the equatorial waters of the Pacific Ocean near Christmas
Island, a 208-foot-long Ukrainian-Russian Zenit 3SL rocket is set
to blast off today from a 20-story high North Sea oil rig that has
been converted into a one-of-a-kind space port.
</P>
<P>
   If the historic demonstration launch is successful, it could
give The Boeing Co., principal partner in the venture known as Sea
Launch, a competitive advantage in its goal of being the world's
premier provider of satellite launch vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But the success of this initial test of the Sea Launch system is
anything but a sure bet. The rocket has had several failures, and
another would be a major setback for Sea Launch, industry experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   The eyes of the world's satellite industry will be watching.
</P>
<P>
   The launch can be seen live on the Internet, at Boeing's Web
site, www.boeing.com. It is scheduled for 2:18 p.m. PST.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of an exciting new era in commercial
space launch activity,'' FAA Administrator Jane Garvey said last
week when the federal regulatory agency announced it had issued a
launch license to the Boeing-led consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications is potentially a $100-billion business, and
the commercial launch business for communication satellites is
exploding. There are many different launch vehicles available to
satellite customers today. More are in development. But there is
stiff competition for the limited number of ground-based launch
sites around the world.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the real significance of Sea Launch and the reason
the program is potentially so important to Boeing, said Marco
Caceres, aerospace analyst with the Teal Group, a market research
firm in Virginia. His speciality is commercial launch vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This platform in the middle of the ocean is really a
commercial space port,'' Caceres said. ``Boeing will have the
advantage of not having to wait in line to launch commercial
payloads because of backups at ground launch sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it will not say so officially, Boeing reportedly has so
far invested upwards of $500 million in Sea Launch, a 40 percent
stake.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is a partner in Sea Launch with the Norwegian shipbuilder
Kvaerner (20 percent); Russia's RSC-Energia (25 percent); and the
Ukrainian company Yuzhnoye/Yuzhmash (15 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Energia is the company that launched the first Sputnik and
designed the Russian Mir space station.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some industry speculation in recent months that
Boeing may not be committed, in the long term, to Sea Launch
because it will be years before the program could be expected to
make a profit. Earlier this year, Boeing executives, who are under
fire to make the company more profitable, announced a sweeping
initiative to identify programs that are not of value to the
company.
</P>
<P>
   In a March 5 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Boeing said development and administrative losses related to the
Sea Launch program were dragging down returns from the company's
space and defense business, and the losses will continue in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technical failure on the initial launch could substantially
impair the prospect for additional customers' acceptance and could
consequently result in significant reduction to the value of the
Sea Launch program assets,'' Boeing cautioned in its SEC filing.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing corporate spokesman Larry McCracken would not say if Sea
Launch is one of the programs that will be scrutinized. But because
the program is just getting started, it will take time to assess
its financial success, he said. Only then would it be fair to look
more closely at the program's margins and costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Caceres said he believes Boeing will stay with Sea Launch for
the long haul. But it could be five years or more before the
program shows a profit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how the market develops,'' Caceres said. And
that will determine the all-important number of yearly launches.
</P>
<P>
   Sea Launch officials have said they hope to initially launch six
to eight rockets a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, any company getting involved in launch services is
not looking to turn a profit quickly,'' Caceres said. ``The
short-term value for Boeing is not that you have another launch
vehicle with Sea Launch, but an independent launch site. That's
something that very few private companies can claim.''
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Sea Launch is the launch platform known as
Odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   The self-propelled platform is a former North Sea oil drilling
platform, which was refurbished at a shipyard in Norway. It is 436
feet long and 220 feet wide, and can cruise along on pontoons
larger than a Trident submarine at a speedy 13 knots.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Odyssey, the Sea Launch project also includes
the Sea Commander, a 660-foot, specially designed rocket-assembly
and mission control ship.
</P>
<P>
   Home port for both vessels is Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   For the initial launch tomorrow, the total crew for both vessels
is about 320 people, half Russians and Ukrainians. The 70 people on
the Odyssey will be transferred to the command ship before the
rocket blast off.
</P>
<P>
   For launch, the Odyssey will be lowered 65 feet more in the
water to provide more stability.
</P>
<P>
   The site in the middle of the Pacific was picked because it is
on the equator, where the Earth's surface is rotating eastward at
better than 1,000 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   A rocket fired there takes less fuel to reach the 17,500 mph
velocity necessary for orbit because the rocket is able to get the
maximum boost from the Earth's rotation. Less rocket fuel means
less weight, which allows increased payload capacity. What it all
adds up to is that a rocket launched from Odyssey can carry a
heavier satellite at less cost to the customer _ the key selling
point for Sea Launch.
</P>
<P>
   The project was conceived to win contracts from such
California-based satellite companies as Hughes. They can save money
because they don't have to pay the cost of transporting their
satellites to far-away launch sites in Russia, Japan, China or
French Guiana or the U.S. facilities at Cape Canaveral, Fla., and
Vandenberg Air Force Base in southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Odyssey may be left at its launch site so it
does not have to return to Long Beach after each firing. Instead
the Sea Commander would carry rocket there. Time saved could allow
a dozen or more commercial launches a year, the same number that
now take place at Cape Canaveral, according to Sea Launch
executives.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Commander can also process two Zenits at a time, so
Odyssey could launch two rockets before the command ship has to
return to Long Beach for another.
</P>
<P>
   The first Sea Launch rocket will carry a dummy payload because
of concerns about past failures of the Zenit booster.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Launch Zenit 3SL is based on the two-stage Zenit 2 built
by the Ukrainians. The third stage is a modified Proton rocket by
Russian's Energia.
</P>
<P>
   The configuration has never been tested before.
</P>
<P>
   Zenit 2 rockets failed in 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1997. The last
resulted in the loss of 12 Globalstar communication satellites. Sea
Launch was to have launched a Galaxy XI satellite on its first
mission, but in the aftermath of of the last Zenit 2 explosion, it
was decided to use a dummy payload.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy satellite was transferred to a French Ariane rocket,
and Sea Launch subsequently lost two of three ICS launches from its
commercial manifest.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hughes and Loral have booked space on Sea Launch for future
launches, but the only certain commercial payload at present is the
third ICO satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Caceres said the success rate of the Zenit 2 is about 80
percent, though that drops to about 75 percent over the last half
dozen years. By comparison, Boeing's Delta 2, a mainstay of the
commercial and government launch business for many years, has a
success rate of about 97 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only one or two of Zenit 2s are launched a year, Caceres said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to launch more often than that to get a good track
record,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One problem Boeing would face if the Zenit 3SL failed is the
highly charged issue of technology transfer by U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the U.S. State Department suspended work on Sea
Launch over concerns that Boeing improperly shared sensitive
technology with its Sea Launch partners. Boeing paid a civil
penalty of $7.5 million and Sea Launch was allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue is apparently not over. A federal grand jury in
Seattle has been hearing information about the technology transfer
to determine if Boeing broke federal law.
</P>
<P>
   It was the failure of a Chinese Long March rocket carrying a
Hughes satellite that resulted in closer examination of technology
transfers involving U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   After the Chinese rocket exploded, a Hughes team shared
information about the cause with the Chinese. That caused an uproar
in Congress, which found that China was able to use the information
to improve its ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing would have to very careful in helping its partners
determine the cause of any the failure of the Zenit 3SL, and that
could delay the program by a year or more, Caceres said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a significant setback,'' he said.

   BILL'S WORLD
</P>
<P>
   By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says his position on Kosovo ``is the best of a lot
of bad alternatives.'' Now he knows how voters often feel.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Americans are split over what to do in Kosovo. Not to
mention what to do in Washington, Jefferson City, Topeka, Albany. .
.
</P>
<P>
   It's been hard for Mr. Clinton to explain the situation in
Kosovo. Where is Chuck Ruff when he really needs him?
</P>
<P>
   Overheard on our bus: ``I could get more worried about Kosovo if
only it didn't sound like a brand name for the pipe Old King Cole
was smoking in the nursery rhyme.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no longer an easy dividing line between our policy at
home and our policy around the world,'' Mr. Clinton says. Right.
They're equally confusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to use military force,'' says Mr. Clinton. But
sometimes Congress just seems to be asking for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to try to prevent as much crime as possible,'' the
president says. What's his idea? Hold fewer elections?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the best system of higher education in the world,''
says Mr. Clinton. Right. But campus drinking makes us wonder if the
emphasis is on higher instead of on education.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Balk, our spring training correspondent, says by opening
day the rosters all will include the overpaid, the substantially
overpaid and the you-won-t-believe-this overpaid.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has chosen a former Italian prime minister as
its Commission president. Are there any politicians in Italy who
haven't, at some time, been prime minister?
</P>
<P>
   An alternate theory: This is Bill Clinton's way of keeping
Monica Lewinsky's British book tour from moving to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strong and stable Europe,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``is good for
America and for the world.'' And not bad for Europe, either.
</P>
<P>
   The government is trying to figure out whether the black-tailed
prairie dog is an endangered species. One question we'd ask: Is it
a native of Serbia?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a stake in European freedom and security and
stability,'' says Mr. Clinton. And, given concern over meat
imports, maybe a steak, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no need to head for the hills'' because of the Y2K
computer bug, a federal emergency official says. Why not? Will they
be shut down, too?
</P>
<P>
   A new study says unilateral economic sanctions rarely work. Yes,
but if you go around saying ``unilateral economic sanctions,''
``unilateral economic sanctions,'' you sound so smart.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of America do we want to leave our children in the
21st century?'' Mr. Clinton asks. One that honors, supports, loves
and feeds parents and grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country is a better place in the last six years because
we've done the right things,'' the president says. Well, at least
some of the time when someone else was looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to run for public office,'' Mr. Clinton says.
Especially if you're related to someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Forbes,'' says Sen. John Kerry, ``is just Ross Perot
without 35 voices in his head.'' That's unfair. Doesn't Perot have
more than that?
</P>
<P>
   BABY TALK
</P>
<P>
   A man and his wife were making their first doctor visit prior to
the birth of their first child. After everything checked out, the
doctor took a small stamp and stamped the wife's stomach with
indelible ink.
</P>
<P>
   The couple was curious about what the stamp was for, so when
they got home, he dug out his magnifying glass to try to see what
it was. In very tiny letters, the stamp said, `When you can read
this, come back and see me.`
</P>
<P>
   FOUR LETTERMAN
</P>
<P>
   A German tourist, looking for directions, pulls up at a bus stop
where two Englishmen are waiting. `Entschuldigung, koennen Sie
Deutsch sprechen?` he says. The two Englishmen just stare at him.
</P>
<P>
   `Excusez-moi, parlez vous Francais?` The two continue to stare.
`Parlare Italiano?` No response, `Hablan ustedes Espanol?` Still
nothing. the Swiss guy drives off, extremely disgusted.
</P>
<P>
   The first Englishman turns to the second and says, `Y'know,
maybe we should learn a foreign language....`
</P>
<P>
   `Why?` says the other, `That bloke knew four languages, and it
didn't do him any good.`
</P>
<P>
   COIN TOSS
</P>
<P>
   Manpreet reports for his final exam. The exam consists of
nothing but
</P>
<P>
   True/False type answers.
</P>
<P>
   He takes his seat, gets the test, stares at the questions for
five minutes, and then in a fit of inspiration takes his wallet
out, removes a coin, and starts tossing the coin. For `Heads` he
marks `True` and for `Tails` he marks `False`.
</P>
<P>
   Within half an hour, Amanpreet is all done whereas the rest of
the class is sweating it out. During the last few minutes, he is
seen desperately throwing the coin, swearing and sweating.
</P>
<P>
   The moderator, a little alarmed, walks over to him and asks him
if he's ok.
</P>
<P>
   Amanpreet spits out, `Yeah, I'm ok. I finished my exam in half
an hour - but I'm not going to have time to check all of these
answers!!!`
</P>
<P>
   DEAD LAWYER JOKE
</P>
<P>
   A guy phones a law office and says: `I want to speak to my
lawyer.` The receptionist replies, `I'm sorry but he died last
week.`
</P>
<P>
   The next day he phones again and asks the same question. The
receptionist replies, `I told you yesterday, he died last week.`
</P>
<P>
   The next day the guy calls again and asks to speak to his
lawyer. By this time the receptionist is getting a little annoyed
and says, `I keep telling you that your lawyer died last week. Why
do you keep calling?`
</P>
<P>
   The guy says, `Because I just love hearing it.`
</P>
<P>
   IS THIS DIRTY?
</P>
<P>
   A woman with six children in tow approached the train fare
counter and asked for five tickets. `One for me`, she said, `then
two full-fare for John and Jack who are 16; two half-fare for
Millie and Mollie who are six; and none at all for Tim and Tom who
are only four.`
</P>
<P>
   The ticket agent stared at the brood of twins. `Do you mean to
tell me, madam,` he said at last, `that you get two children every
time?`
</P>
<P>
   `Of course not,` the woman replied. `Usually, we don't get any
at all.`

<P>
   EL ROSARIO, Mexico _ In a scene out of science fiction, millions
of monarch butterflies cling to the branches of fir trees in
shivering clumps, swaying gently like giant prehistoric flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the sun bursts through the forest and the monarchs
explode into flight, creating a blizzard of orange and black wings
as translucent as stained glass, as delicate as the strains of a
harpsichord.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please watch your step!'' urges guide Sergio Antonio Moreno,
as tennis shoes kick up dust and narrowly miss butterflies in their
path.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, ma'am,'' Moreno answers a woman carrying a plastic bag,
``you can't take the butterflies with you, not even the dead
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in this remote forest 120 miles west of Mexico City, a
country is struggling to balance one of the world's most
extraordinary natural wonders against the needs of very poor
farmers and the demands of well-meaning tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon is the 2,000-mile monarch butterfly migration,
from summer breeding grounds on the U.S.-Canadian border down
through the Gulf states and into winter enclaves in Mexico's Sierra
Madre mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Flying about 100 miles a day, the butterflies' trek is as old as
modern humans.
</P>
<P>
   But the migration is so endangered by logging, land erosion and
poorly managed tourism that it could be wiped out within our
lifetime, according to some experts. That danger exists despite a
decade of attempts to protect the monarchs' habitat in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is now the Achilles' heel of the monarch migration,''
said biologist Lincoln Brower of Sweet Briar College in Virginia.
``Losing it would be like losing Yellowstone National Park.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the number of butterflies that have
gathered in Mexico have declined 70 to 80 percent (CQ), according
to Brower. The reasons remain a mystery, but Brower is convinced
that El Nino's drought conditions, logging and the draining of
water from streams for cottage industries are the culprits.
</P>
<P>
   Homero Aridjis, a Mexican writer and environmentalist who grew
up among the butterflies, said logging -- clandestine and legal --
continues to destroy the fir trees known as ``oyamel'' that are the
butterflies' protective blanket while they winter in Michoacan and
Mexico states between November and late March. Most of the monarchs
that migrate from east of the Rocky Mountains winter in this area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine the scandal if you were to destroy the Sistine
Chapel,'' said Aridjis, calling the butterflies' gathering in
Mexico ``a masterpiece of nature'' comparable to ``listening to
Mozart.''
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to protect the butterflies' habitat, Brower, the
World Wildlife Foundation and others are working with the Mexican
government on a scientific review of monarch sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, researchers confirmed that monarchs resting in
Mexico during the winter came from the Great Lakes region and the
American Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, five out of a dozen mountain ranges in the Sierra Madre
identified as monarch habitat were declared sanctuaries, areas
where logging would be either prohibited or strictly controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say it is urgent that areas not yet protected
be declared sanctuaries also, or those forests will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do it drive through that area and see all the
logging trucks, most illegal,'' said Chip Taylor, a University of
Kansas entomologist and director of Monarch Watch, a group that
monitors the migration.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty has led to a plundering of the forest as farmers raze
trees to make way for crops or cut down trees to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they're just as poor as they were before,'' Aridjis said.
</P>
<P>
   If it is going to declare more land as sanctuaries, Mexico also
needs a long-term plan for showing people who own that land now
that they can earn money from a ``living forest'' through managed
tourism and other activities, Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctuaries like El Rosario -- where farmers now serve as guides
-- are a beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Each family that owns a piece of the land here must send a
member to work at the sanctuary, either as a guide or maintenance
worker. In exchange, they receive a cut of the proceeds from
tickets, which are about $1.50 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all poor here, but most of us are in agreement with
this now,'' said guide Antonio Moreno, 20.
</P>
<P>
   But Moreno and other guides now well versed in the monarchs'
needs said even tourism is taking a toll on the sanctuary. On
weekends, as many as 8,000 people pour through the reserve, raising
thick clouds of dust and making so much noise that the butterflies
flee higher into the hills.
</P>
<P>
   Outside El Rosario, shacks selling souvenirs stand on bare land
where groves of trees hosted monarchs a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really very worried,'' said Javier de la Maza, director
of Mexico's protected areas. ``I'm the first one to say that things
have gotten out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Mexico may consider proposals to allow environmental
groups to work with farmers to manage the tourism.
</P>
<P>
   The monarchs' breeding ground in Canada and the United States is
vast, encompassing about 1.3 million square miles and stretching
from the Great Lakes down into Texas and other Gulf Coast states.
</P>
<P>
   But in Mexico the insects funnel into an area that measures only
about 30 by 60 miles. And only a fraction of that -- 60 square
miles -- is currently protected.
</P>
<P>
   Within those 60 square miles, logging is prohibited in less than
18 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific review of the monarchs' habitat could increase
the number of sanctuaries, said de la Maza. But nothing is certain.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico also has launched reforestation projects it hopes will
restore some of the forest that's been lost inside sanctuaries, de
la Maza added.
</P>
<P>
   The alarm clock that starts the monarchs on their journey to
Mexico is the autumnal equinox in late September. That when they
return to the winter grounds from where their great-grandparents
flew the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Like a orange snowstorm, they flutter into the Sierra Madre in
late October, just in time for Mexico's Day of the Dead celebration
on Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say they return to pay their respects to their
ancestors,'' said Moreno. He said he and his neighbors used to call
the butterflies ``doves'' and had no idea where they came from each
year.
</P>
<P>
   On a quiet weekday, the sanctuary's trees are covered with
butterflies. By mid-morning, they drop from the trees and fill the
air, lighting in meadows to drink from dew and streams and to feed
on wildflowers. Sometimes hundreds tumble from branches in one fell
swoop, like a waterfall or carpet unfurling. Their wings beat a
soft hum that competes with the wind.
</P>
<P>
   The monarchs mate, some die and around the vernal equinox in
late March they leave in droves, flying north again where three
more generations are born before the cycle is repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a unique world phenomenon,'' Brower said.
``There are certain areas in world that transcend nationalism. The
monarch reserves are one of them.''

   EL ROSARIO, Mexico _ In a scene out of science fiction, millions
of monarch butterflies cling to the branches of fir trees in
shivering clumps, swaying gently like giant prehistoric flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the sun bursts through the forest and the monarchs
explode into flight, creating a blizzard of orange and black wings
as translucent as stained glass, as delicate as the strains of a
harpsichord.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please watch your step!'' urges guide Sergio Antonio Moreno,
as tennis shoes kick up dust and narrowly miss butterflies in their
path.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, ma'am,'' Moreno answers a woman carrying a plastic bag,
``you can't take the butterflies with you, not even the dead
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in this remote forest 120 miles west of Mexico City, a
country is struggling to balance one of the world's most
extraordinary natural wonders against the needs of very poor
farmers and the demands of well-meaning tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon is the 2,000-mile monarch butterfly migration,
from summer breeding grounds on the U.S.-Canadian border down
through the Gulf states and into winter enclaves in Mexico's Sierra
Madre mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Flying about 100 miles a day, the butterflies' trek is as old as
modern humans.
</P>
<P>
   But the migration is so endangered by logging, land erosion and
poorly managed tourism that it could be wiped out within our
lifetime, according to some experts. That danger exists despite a
decade of attempts to protect the monarchs' habitat in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is now the Achilles' heel of the monarch migration,''
said biologist Lincoln Brower of Sweet Briar College in Virginia.
``Losing it would be like losing Yellowstone National Park.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the number of butterflies that have
gathered in Mexico have declined 70 to 80 percent (CQ), according
to Brower. The reasons remain a mystery, but Brower is convinced
that El Nino's drought conditions, logging and the draining of
water from streams for cottage industries are the culprits.
</P>
<P>
   Homero Aridjis, a Mexican writer and environmentalist who grew
up among the butterflies, said logging -- clandestine and legal --
continues to destroy the fir trees known as ``oyamel'' that are the
butterflies' protective blanket while they winter in Michoacan and
Mexico states between November and late March. Most of the monarchs
that migrate from east of the Rocky Mountains winter in this area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine the scandal if you were to destroy the Sistine
Chapel,'' said Aridjis, calling the butterflies' gathering in
Mexico ``a masterpiece of nature'' comparable to ``listening to
Mozart.''
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to protect the butterflies' habitat, Brower, the
World Wildlife Foundation and others are working with the Mexican
government on a scientific review of monarch sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, researchers confirmed that monarchs resting in
Mexico during the winter came from the Great Lakes region and the
American Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, five out of a dozen mountain ranges in the Sierra Madre
identified as monarch habitat were declared sanctuaries, areas
where logging would be either prohibited or strictly controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say it is urgent that areas not yet protected
be declared sanctuaries also, or those forests will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do it drive through that area and see all the
logging trucks, most illegal,'' said Chip Taylor, a University of
Kansas entomologist and director of Monarch Watch, a group that
monitors the migration.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty has led to a plundering of the forest as farmers raze
trees to make way for crops or cut down trees to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they're just as poor as they were before,'' Aridjis said.
</P>
<P>
   If it is going to declare more land as sanctuaries, Mexico also
needs a long-term plan for showing people who own that land now
that they can earn money from a ``living forest'' through managed
tourism and other activities, Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctuaries like El Rosario -- where farmers now serve as guides
-- are a beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Each family that owns a piece of the land here must send a
member to work at the sanctuary, either as a guide or maintenance
worker. In exchange, they receive a cut of the proceeds from
tickets, which are about $1.50 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all poor here, but most of us are in agreement with
this now,'' said guide Antonio Moreno, 20.
</P>
<P>
   But Moreno and other guides now well versed in the monarchs'
needs said even tourism is taking a toll on the sanctuary. On
weekends, as many as 8,000 people pour through the reserve, raising
thick clouds of dust and making so much noise that the butterflies
flee higher into the hills.
</P>
<P>
   Outside El Rosario, shacks selling souvenirs stand on bare land
where groves of trees hosted monarchs a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really very worried,'' said Javier de la Maza, director
of Mexico's protected areas. ``I'm the first one to say that things
have gotten out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Mexico may consider proposals to allow environmental
groups to work with farmers to manage the tourism.
</P>
<P>
   The monarchs' breeding ground in Canada and the United States is
vast, encompassing about 1.3 million square miles and stretching
from the Great Lakes down into Texas and other Gulf Coast states.
</P>
<P>
   But in Mexico the insects funnel into an area that measures only
about 30 by 60 miles. And only a fraction of that -- 60 square
miles -- is currently protected.
</P>
<P>
   Within those 60 square miles, logging is prohibited in less than
18 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific review of the monarchs' habitat could increase
the number of sanctuaries, said de la Maza. But nothing is certain.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico also has launched reforestation projects it hopes will
restore some of the forest that's been lost inside sanctuaries, de
la Maza added.
</P>
<P>
   The alarm clock that starts the monarchs on their journey to
Mexico is the autumnal equinox in late September. That when they
return to the winter grounds from where their great-grandparents
flew the year before.
</P>
<P>

   MIAMI _ Anticipation's been building in Cuba all week: the
Yankees are coming.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not the Yankees exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the Baltimore Orioles will become the first Major League
Baseball team to stand on a Havana diamond in 40 years when they
face off at noon EST Sunday against a 27-man squad of Cuban
all-stars.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, hours later, dozens of U.S. musicians, including
Jimmy Buffett and the Atlanta-based Indigo Girls, will stage a free
invitation-only concert at the Karl Marx theater, also in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball diplomacy. Pop music diplomacy. There seems to be all
kinds of diplomacy going on this weekend between the United States
and its communist archenemy just 90 miles from South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone's in a festive mood.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-line Cuban exiles are outraged, warning that this weekend's
events will do little but provide cheap publicity for Cuba's
repressive leader, Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that these people can still be playing baseball while
the Cuban people are experiencing a new wave of repression is
patently offensive,'' said Alberto M. Hernandez, chairman of the
Cuban American National Foundation, the nation's most powerful
anti-Castro group.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks ago, the Cuban government handed down harsh
prison sentences for four well-known Cuban dissidents who openly
criticized the Communist Party, drawing condemnations from even
Canada and the European Union, countries that want normal trade
with the island to resume.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba also approved a law that imposes severe penalties against
political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics say the events are largely symbolic and don't go
far enough to engage Cuba and end decades of hostility with the
island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe more engagement would give us more leverage in
Cuba's affairs,'' said Damian Fernandez, an expert on Cuba at
Florida International University.
</P>
<P>
   But will these star-studded events lead to an overall warming of
U.S.-Cuba relations? Will Castro _ a former baseball pitcher who
will attend Sunday's game _ provide a symbol of this thaw by
throwing out the first ball?
</P>
<P>
   No one knows the answers.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the events have aroused great interest in baseball-mad
Havana, where the rustic Estadio Latinoamericano _ which seats
50,000 and serves coffee and ham sandwiches _ is expected to be
packed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The last time major league teams played ball in Cuba was in
March 1959, when the Los Angeles Dodgers went to bat against the
Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people here really like Americans, so we're happy to have
so many Americans here,'' said Amado Alvarez, a painter and
baseball fanatic. ``Cuban players are very good, so we are sure
they'll perform well against the Orioles.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Alvarez, tickets for the game won't be made
available to the general public. Rather, they'll be set aside by
the Cuban government for selected groups, such as foreign reporters
and school organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Cable sports network ESPN plans to broadcast the game.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Clinton administration says the cultural
exchanges are an attempt to boost people-to-people contacts, part
of an overall strategy to isolate Castro and foster openness on the
island. Washington authorized the events on Jan. 5 as exceptions to
an economic embargo imposed against Cuba in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans are scheduled to play a return game at Camden Yards
in Baltimore on May 3.
</P>
<P>
   The contacts ``expose the Cuban people to the values of a free
society ... and help them prepare for a better tomorrow,'' said
Michael Ranneberger, the Clinton administration's coordinator of
Cuban affairs.
</P>
<P>
   He said the events shouldn't be seen as moves toward closer ties
with Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Any proceeds from the game will go not to the Castro government,
but to fund sports activities, mostly among Cuban youth.
</P>
<P>
   But even U.S. officials agree that the timing of the events is
ticklish.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Clinton administration's promotion of
people-to-people contacts has made the Cuban government a bit wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the people-to-people contacts are carried out in a
non-political way, then that will be good,'' said Roberto de Armas,
a Cuban government spokesman. ``But if they're used in a political
way, the future of these kinds of contacts could be affected.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Those participating in this weekend's events say politics isn't
even on their radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Carter, who manages the Indigo Girls, say Amy Ray and
Emily Saliers are doing what they love best: collaborating with
other musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amy and Emily have music on their minds, not politics,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Cuba hosted a major American concert was in 1979,
when Billy Joel and Kris Kristofferson performed at an event titled
``Havana Jams.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, more than 40 performers, including Burt Bacharach,
James Taylor, and Gladys Knight, began arriving in Havana for a
week of songwriting and jam sessions with their Cuban counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Roy Scott, the California songwriter behind the exchange
known as ``Music Bridges Over Troubled Waters,'' said Sunday's
concert carries no political overtones.
</P>
<P>
   And neither does the baseball game, said Joe Foss, the Orioles'
vice chairman for business and finance. He said the team hopes the
games ``can help people in the two countries come together.''
</P>
<P>
   But not since the visit to Cuba by Pope John Paul II in January
1998 has such a debate erupted over the future of an ideological
divide that dates back to the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the U.S. Senate approved a resolution 98-0 urging
the Clinton administration to mobilize international pressure for
political change on the island.
</P>
<P>
   The House has passed a similar resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-American members of Congress have chastised the
administration for allowing baseball players and musicians to
travel to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the wrong signal: if the United States can play ball with
Castro, then there can't be any serious problems there,'' said Rep.
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Some liken this weekend's events to the famous ``ping-pong''
diplomacy between the United States and China in the early 1970s,
when a visit by the U.S. national table tennis team helped pave the
way for President Nixon's official talks with China's communist
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But many observers predict the events in Cuba will have little
overall impact on U.S.-Cuba relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't expect relations to get better any time soon,''
said Wayne Smith, who headed the U.S. Interests Section in Havana
during the Carter administration. ``In fact, official relations
could hardly grow any worse.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, relations have deteriorated as Washington
condemned the harsh sentences imposed on the dissidents, and Cuba
cut off most U.S. telephone links due to unpaid bills by American
phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   But if nothing else, Kirby Jones, a Washington consultant, said
this weekend's events have spurred more interest among U.S.
businesspeople in Cuba. He said dozens of U.S. companies have
signed up for a U.S.-Cuba Business Summit scheduled for May 19 in
Cancun, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it is baseball fever, but there appears to be more
interest in Cuba now than there was last year,'' said Jones, who
has already led two business delegations to Cuba. ``The game has
symbolic importance, and it seems to be captivating people even
more than the pope's visit.''

when a visit by the U.S. national table tennis team helped pave the
way for President Nixon's official talks with China's communist
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But many observers predict the events in Cuba will have little
overall impact on U.S.-Cuba relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't expect relations to get better any time soon,''
said Wayne Smith, who headed the U.S. Interests Section in Havana
during the Carter administration. ``In fact, official relations
could hardly grow any worse.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, relations have deteriorated as Washington
condemned the harsh sentences imposed on the dissidents, and Cuba
cut off most U.S. telephone links due to unpaid bills by American
phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   But if nothing else, Kirby Jones, a Washington consultant, said
this weekend's events have spurred more interest among U.S.
businesspeople in Cuba. He said dozens of U.S. companies have
signed up for a U.S.-Cuba Business Summit scheduled for May 19 in
Cancun, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it is baseball fever, but there appears to be more
interest in Cuba now than there was last year,'' said Jones, who
has already led two business delegations to Cuba. ``The game has
symbolic importance, and it seems to be captivating people even
more than the pope's visit.''

   KOSOVO-RDP (Washington) _ As NATO forces stepped up their
bombing assault into the daylight hours, President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia maintained fierce resistance both on the
ground and in the air. Two of his MIG-29 fighters shot down on what
NATO claimed was a foray into neighboring Bosnia. The sweep by Serb
troops through the ethnic Albanian villages of Kosovo continued
unabated, NATO said, despite the third straight day of air assaults
that NATO officials emphasized would be unrelenting until Milosevic
accepted peace. By Francis X. Clines and Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO-ASSESS (Brussels, Belgium) _ The allied military
strategy for stopping Serbian attacks against ethnic Albanian
rebels in Kosovo rests largely on the hope of a specific Serbian
response to the heavy NATO bombing that began on Wednesday,
according to officials here. The hope, allied officers and
diplomats say, is that intense airstrikes will cause so much damage
to Yugoslavia's army and its sophisticated air-defense system that
Serb commanders may soon pressure him to back down and accept
allied terms before they lose everything. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-YUGOSLAVIA (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ Whispers about a
face-saving Serbian loss to the world's most powerful military
alliance began here long before NATO bombs started to fall.
Surrendering control of Kosovo through peaceful negotiation would
be humiliating. But a hard military loss of Kosovo, after a brave
and hopeless struggle against an overwhelming Western foe, could be
just the ticket that Milosevic needs to survive with his Serbian
manhood and his rule intact. By Blaine Harden.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-COUNCIL (United Nations) _ In a resounding victory for
the United States and its NATO alliance, the Security Council
overwhelmingly rejected Friday a Russian-sponsored resolution
demanding an immediate end to NATO's airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
The vote on the 15-member Security Council was 12 against the
resolution and three in favor. By Judith Miller.

<P>
   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy _ Day Three of the air campaign against
Yugoslavia, and with every roaring jet that leaves this sprawling
NATO air base in northwestern Italy, the tension mounts that one
may not come back.
</P>
<P>
   Aviano is the busiest base involved in the campaign over Kosovo,
a giant staging area for U.S.-led air attacks surrounded by rich
farmland and picturesque villages, the snow-capped Dolomites
looming to the north.
</P>
<P>
   But as the NATO operation grinds on, and the total number of
sorties climbs, concern here grows that so far it has all been a
little too easy for the pilots, who have met little in the way of
resistance from Serbian anti-aircraft fire or attack aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's tension, a lot of tension,'' said Marine Lance Cpl.
Dominic Easton, 21, of Miami, Fla., a technician on the EA-6B
Prowler, a radio- and radar-jamming jet aircraft designed to foil
enemy communications.
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns grew Friday as NATO officials reported that two
Yugoslav MiG-29 fighters were shot down in action against allied
planes in the skies over Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the people who are flying the missions and those on the
ground here at Aviano, you have to know that we worry about them
while they are up there and we worry about them coming back,'' said
Canadian Air Force Capt. Dave Muralt. The Canadians have six F-18
Hornets with 130 pilots and support crew at Aviano. (Citing
security concerns, U.S. officials have not made American pilots
available for interviews).
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, this is a U.S. base. Italy owns it, but
it is dominated by the American 31st Fighter Wing -- two squadrons
of F-16s and dozens of other warplanes and support aircraft. The
fighters carry the wing's motto: ``Return With Honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The community of Aviano, just north of the base, is quaintly
Italian, with stucco-walled villas and blossoming fruit trees --
and a dash of America to accommodate the contingent of 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;R Block has an office here, as does the U.S. Automobile
Association. There's a bowling alley, a steak house and, the staple
of nearly every base town, a strip joint. Armed Forces Radio
broadcasts rock-and-roll, country music, Russ Limbaugh and NPR to
the forces. The Aviano Inn offers the classics like chianti and
linguine on its menu, along with cheeseburgers and Cokes.
</P>
<P>
   A tent city sprouted on the base last month to house another
1,000 Air Force and Marine troops brought in as U.S. forces geared
up for the current operation.
</P>
<P>
   American pilots have been filling a combat role over the Balkans
from Aviano since 1994 in Operation: Deny Flight, NATO's air
mission to prevent flights by Bosnian Serb warplanes. In 1995, U.S.
F-16s flew more than 400 combat sorties that helped convince the
Bosnian Serbs to concede to the Dayton Peace Accords being
negotiated at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The conviction is strongly voiced among Americans on- and
off-the base that the United States and NATO are doing the right
thing now by seeking to limit Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's ability to wage war against ethnic Albanians in the
separatist province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The risk to American pilots is just part of the job, they say,
but it doesn't alleviate the tension that has settled over the
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want my husband to be a pilot, I'd be a nervous
wreck,'' said the secretary of Aviano's Baptist church, who did not
give her name.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest concern in the American community is that Aviano
could become a target.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared to send my daughter to school at the base this
morning. You know, terrorism,'' said Erica McNelly, the wife of a
civilian contractor. ``People are worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Military police forces, clad in flak jackets and combat helmets,
have stepped up security measures and canceled events, such as
soccer games and a talent show, that would draw American civilians
to the base's community center. Bomb-sniffing dogs inspect every
car entering the base and Humvee's patrol the base perimeter, their
mounted machine guns manned and ready.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials refuse to discuss security, and whether the
increased security is in response to a specific threat.
</P>
<P>
   But locals believe the security is extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' said McNelly, an Aviano native who married her
American husband 16 years ago, ``is not normal.''

CLINTON INVOKES DOMINO THEORY TO JUSTIFY BALKAN INTERVENTION  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 28)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 A News Analysis   
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has dusted off the Cold War-era
``domino theory'' _ used to rationalize U.S. intervention in
Vietnam _ to help justify the U.S.-led attack against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton argues that the most sustained allied bombing campaign
since the Persian Gulf War is required to crush Yugoslav armed
forces in order to stem the threat of a wider war across the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let a fire burn here in this area and the flames will
spread,'' Clinton warned last week. ``Eventually key U.S. allies
could be drawn into a wider conflict or we would be forced to
confront it later only at far greater risk and greater cost.''
</P>
<P>
   The president did not mention Greece and Turkey by name but his
subordinates did, citing the risk that the exodus of ethnic
Albanian Muslim refugees from the Yugoslav onslaught in Kosovo
could ignite repercussions in neighboring Albania and Macedonia _
prompting Turkey and Greece to enter the conflict to protect their
ethnic and religious allies.
</P>
<P>
   All of these nations have some ethnic or religious linkage to
the rivalries underlying Yugoslavia's attempts to suppress Kosovo's
drive for independence.
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said the flood of
refugees out of Kosovo ``threatens peace in the Balkans and the
stability of Europe'' because it could ``exacerbate rivalries
between Greece and Turkey _ two of our NATO allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Greece nor Turkey last week declared any intention to
intervene in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's rationale recalls the explanation
used by President Lyndon Baines Johnson in the 1960s to explain
what became a fruitless 11-year intervention in Vietnam to stem the
southward march by communist North Vietnamese forces.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said U.S. aid was needed to prevent South Vietnam from
falling to the communist onslaught like a ``domino,'' leading to
potential communist takeovers in Laos, Cambodia, Thailand,
Malaysia, and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   But Balkan experts question the Clinton administration's
contention that allied intervention is needed to halt the civil war
in Yugoslavia in order to avert a wider war spreading to Albania
and Macedonia, provoking intervention by Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Bulent Aliriza, a Turkey expert at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C., says the ethnic,
historic and religious alliances crisscrossing the Balkans are
unlikely to ignite a wider conflict involving Turkey and Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship between Turkey and Greece has been strained
for a long time,'' said Aliriza. ``Add the wrinkle of Kosovo and it
doesn't make the relationship any worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Greece opposes the allied bombing of the Yugoslav Serbs; Turkey
supports the operation, designed in part to halt Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosovic's repression of ethnic Albanian Muslim
separatists in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey and Greece have long had a tense relationship based on
differences over the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, territory in
the Aegean Sea and Greece's protection of fugitive Kurdish rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan in Kenya, where he was seized by Turkish
commandos on Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, both Turkey and Greece are democratic members of
the 19-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Greece belongs to
the 15-nation European Union; Turkey wants to join.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kane, an expert on Turkey who served with the Central
Intelligence Agency in a variety of overseas posts including
Turkey, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon and Algeria, also discounts the
possibility of a full blown regional conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greece and Turkey have a lot to fight about as it is and they
have both shown restraint,'' Kane said. ``The idea that Kosovo
could have triggered a war between Greece and Turkey is kind of
far-fetched. It's nothing to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Montville, a 23-year veteran of State Department posts in
the Middle East and North Africa who now serves as director of a
preventive diplomacy project at CSIS, dubs the risk of war between
Greece and Turkey ``hypothetical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the dogs of war were unleashed and left unchecked in that
part of the world, you could see tensions flare in Albania and
Macedonia,'' Montville said. ``It doesn't take much to get the
Greeks and the Turks geared up to threaten war _ but going to war
is a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Montville and Aliriza caution, however, that events in the
Balkans often prove unpredictable. As Aliriza puts it: ``You start
turning the pages of history and looking at the remnants of
minorities in these countries and a remote possibility always
exists that Turkey and Greece could stumble into war.''
</P>
<P>
   The specialists cite two worst case scenarios:
</P>
<P>
   _ Turkey would come to the aid of besieged fellow Muslims in
Kosovo, Albania or Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanian Muslims comprise 90 percent of the population in
Yugoslav-controlled Kosovo; 70 percent of the 3.3 million people in
Albania; and 30 percent of the 2 million people in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Some 450,000 ethnic Albanian refugees have fled their homes in
Kosovo over the past year, with an estimated 260,000 remaining in
Kosovo, 55,000 in neighboring provinces in Yugoslavia, 20,000 in
Macedonia and 18,500 in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   _ Greece, a predominantly Eastern Orthodox Christian nation with
historic and religious ties to the Serbian allies with whom they
fought the Ottoman Turks, would come to the aid of imperiled Greeks
in Albania or Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Greeks account for up to an estimated 12 percent of the
population in Albania and 65 percent of the population in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said Friday the allied
campaign has diminished the risk of a wider war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be a greater risk of a wider war if we had done
nothing,'' Lockhart said. ``The war has not spread in a material
way.''

<P>
   The Balkan tinder box traces its fuse back centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Ottoman Turks swept into southeastern Europe in the 1300s,
storming across Greece to triumph over defending Serbs in a
legendary battle in Kosovo in 1389 that opened the door to Turkish
Muslim domination of the Eastern Orthodox Christian region for six
centuries until World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Stubborn antagonisms linger still between Muslim descendants of
the occupying Turks and Christian descendants of conquered Serbs
and Greeks who fought for centuries to rid their homelands of
unwelcome Turkish overlords.

   COLORADO-CRIME-PUNISHMENT. On a cold December night in 1994,
gang members gunned down 18-year-old Maximino ``Mino'' Galindo in
an alley in east Pueblo, a city torn by gang violence. Galindo's
slaying was the fifth gang-related murder that year. Five years
after Galindo's death, gangs are still active on the streets of
Pueblo, but something of a miracle seems to have taken place. Last
year, there were no gang-related murders. Even more striking has
been the drop in total crime in this city of 100,000: Since the
start of 1995, Pueblo's total crime rate has been cut in half, down
52 percent through the end of last year, according to the FBI's

 &HT;    Doctors' new oath: Physician, publicize thyself
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Dr. Daniel Choy has a flourishing
medical practice on the tony upper East Side of Manhattan. Chances
are you've heard of him.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City surgeon was disappointed a few years ago when
a procedure he devised to treat spine problems wasn't catching on
in the medical community _ or with prospective patients. Articles
had appeared in respected medical journals such as the New England
Journal of Medicine, but an article here or there wasn't cutting
it.
</P>
<P>
   So, Choy took a step many other ambitious doctors are turning to
_ and not without some criticism. He hired a public-relations
expert, a ``flack,'' paying a professional to do what he couldn't.
Amanda-Beth Uhry, a specialist in New York City, would get the word
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``She worked for me for about a year and in that time got me
into some newspapers, and CBS did a news program on me. And God, it
was incredible. My phone rang off the hook for months after.''
</P>
<P>
   As more doctors strive to maintain their financial health during
times of changing insurance practices, they're increasingly
employing promotional experts.
</P>
<P>
   But self-promotion can still carry an odor _ even among those
who play the PR game themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Ellenbogen, a Los Angeles plastic surgeon, says he
needs the help because his speciality is so competitive. But he
doesn't approve of traditional doctors such as Choy doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm selling something, so I have to create a market,'' he said
in a recent article in American Medical News, a publication of the
American Medical Association. ``But it's reprehensible for a doctor
who takes care of illness to do PR.''
</P>
<P>
   Choy says with his procedure, ``People get off the table usually
free of pain.'' But he adds: ``New technologies take a long time to
diffuse through the medical community and the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, the medical community frowned on doctors trumpeting
their skills. Today, the American Medical Association has no rules
against it, except guidelines that ban anything misleading. Aside
from that, anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   That means telephone calls and faxes from agents to reporters,
editors and producers, and glossy photos and press releases
overnighted and hand-delivered _ all carefully planned to score
some attention for clients and their medical ``breakthroughs.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest stunt Boca Raton, Fla., publicist Barry Epstein ever
pulled for a medical client was for Dr. Richard Staller, a dentist.
</P>
<P>
   Staller is a baseball fanatic, so Epstein sent out photos of the
dentist in a baseball uniform, one with a bat over his shoulder,
posed by his dental chair. Staller had practiced with the
Philadelphia Phillies in a ``dream team'' program during spring
training _ that was the news hook. But stories also mentioned
Staller's ``thriving dental practice with offices in Palm Beach and
Broward counties.''
</P>
<P>
   Bingo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hook, an angle. Spring training and the Marlins were
big, and the newspapers ate it up,'' Epstein says. ``Visibility is
the word. The name of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   And that kind of exposure carries far more credibility, PR
experts say, than paid advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a doctor appears on `20/20' and shows their personality,
and can more clearly explain what they need to, it holds more
weight in the mind of the consumer than seeing an ad where doctors
advertise themselves,'' says Kathy Rothman, of Uhry's firm.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Randie Levine-Miller, president of Accent on Broadcasting
in New York City: ``Advertising is too blatant, and a lot of people
get very turned off when they see doctors advertising; they don't
trust them. If they see an article in the newspaper, they think the
printed word is the gospel. It's a virtual endorsement when a
reporter gives a mention to a doctor unless it's a controversial
piece.''
</P>
<P>
   For that very reason, not all doctors want the public to know
they are paying to get into newspapers, magazines and TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of doctors like it kept confidential,'' says Rothman.
``They think that letting the public know defeats the purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Uhry, the Manhattan PR agent, opened her firm seven years ago
when plastic surgeons _ the firm's bread-and-butter clients _
started dropping procedures that required insurance and
reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were looking to take their practices from reconstructive
to cosmetic, because it was more profitable,'' Rothman says.
</P>
<P>
   The fierce competition in that field drove many to seek
professional public relations counselors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plastic surgery, dermatology, it's enormously competitive.
When the economy's good, patients can afford it. But doctors want
their practices to flourish independent of the economic condition.
That's what we do, increase their name recognition, find their
target market,'' Rothman adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, the way people pick elective surgeons, sadly
enough, it's what kind of buzz they heard about it. Like a
restaurant. They equate having heard about it with people being
good.''
</P>
<P>
   But individual doctors aren't the only ones turning to
professional public relations agents.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals and medical centers are also trying to distinguish
themselves from their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the individual doctor necessarily who is doing
this,'' said Kathy Adams, president of MediaReach in West Palm
Beach, which has Duke University Medical Center and Intracoastal
Health Systems (which runs Good Samaritan and St. Mary's medical
centers here) as clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones who use PR companies are more cutting edge . . . The
advantage is to inform the public of what's coming out now so the
consumer can better research that.''
</P>
<P>
   And what do these publicity artists say when confronted by
doctors who think promotion is unethical?
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors who think it's horrible,'' said Levine-Miller,
``are the doctors who can't get ink.''

 &HT;    Eating lunch at your desk? You're not alone
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla _ The self-indulgent days of leisurely
lunch hours are over, the three-martini business lunch long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Most American workers are instead wolfing down lunch at their
desks, a new survey says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the average amount of time workers spend eating lunch
on weekdays hovers at around 24 minutes, according to the survey of
1,002 people by the National Cheese Institute and American Dairy
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the study found that between 25-30 percent of workers
are taking 15 minutes or less for lunch. About 60 percent take
between 15 and 30 minutes, and only 10 percent take 30 minutes or
more for their noontime break.
</P>
<P>
   Those who eat at their desks have plenty of company.
</P>
<P>
   At JFK Medical Center in Atlantis, Human Resources Director
Denise Kaufman agrees with the survey results.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my employees, I try to give them lunch. But only two out
of the seven really take a lunch hour,'' she says. ``The work is
there, and they're not clock-watchers.''
</P>
<P>
   And at school district headquarters, the situation is much the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Walters, spokeswoman for the Palm Beach County school board,
says quickie lunches reflect a fuller workday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a time issue. The day is too short. We have faxes now,
and people are used to getting immediate responses. We have more
work to do and we don't have more people to do it ... And very
often, that's when I find people in _ over lunch hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman says she's requested a lunch cart do rounds so workers
can ``grab a sandwich in the break room. Lunch is a half hour in
our place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's because people do want to get out early, for
daycare or picking up children. But I don't really think that's
what it is. It's that the pace at work is so fast nowadays, that
people just don't have time. It's really difficult to say, `I'm
going to lunch.'''

 &HT;    Road rage? Naw, Mom's just having a baby
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Here's Margaret Rivera weaving her Chevy
Cavalier through Interstate 95 traffic, honking, steering with one
hand, sobbing, praying and, with her right hand, trying desperately
to deliver Rita Namur's baby, who is keeping an urgent appointment
with the world right now!
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of imagery for this early in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Let's go back a few ticks and set the stage for what became
Namur's wild ride to Bethesda Memorial Hospital in Boynton Beach,
Fla., at 10 a.m. on Thursday, March 18.
</P>
<P>
   Namur, 23, of suburban Lake Worth, is the wife of Juan Namur,
33, who six months ago suffered an incapacitating neck injury in a
fall on the job. Rivera, 46, is his home caretaker. She had just
stopped by on a scheduled visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could you take a look at my wife?'' Juan asked Margaret in
Spanish. ``She is feeling strangely.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight months' pregnant, Rita's due date was April 1, and the
mother of a 3-year-old did not think she was going into labor. But
when Margaret called the expectant mother's doctor, she was told to
get Rita to Bethesda.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret drove while, between contractions, Rita gave
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get off at Woolbright going west when we should have been
going east, and I'm weaving around, trying to drive, and I look
down and here's the baby's crown, and I've got to turn around, and
suddenly Rita arches up and cries out my name as long as I've ever
heard it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Margieeeeeeeeeeeee!''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret executes a deft backhand stab, catching the baby on the
short hop off the seat, and manages to flip the baby girl on the
mother's chest and pull into a strip mall simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks I'm road-raging, but this one woman in
traffic can tell that something's up, so she pulls over and says,
`I'm an R.N. Is there a problem?'''
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes. Margaret, a study in efficiency, is managing to have a
nervous breakdown and minister to the newborn girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I'm parked, I reach over and swoop the mouth . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Swoop?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, clear the stuff out of the mouth. I gave the baby a
smack on the bottom, and she started crying, but then she stopped,
and I picked her up, the cord still hanging, and give her a couple
of breaths and another spank, and she starts yelling. It was
wonderful!''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the nurse _ Margaret believes her name is Rita Tart _
reports that an ambulance is on the way, and now it is time to cut
the umbilical cord.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turned my car upside-down, looking for something to cut it
with. Somebody, I don't know who it was, came up with a spring
clamp for holding papers together, but we still didn't have a
blade.''
</P>
<P>
   And here the mother, who had gone into labor and delivered in 15
minutes, was composed enough to offer a suggestion in Spanish, a
memory of how Mexican midwives cut the umbilical cord. You can see
what's coming, can't you?
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Here goes,''' said Margaret, ``and, `chomp,' bit
through the cord. Then we clamped it off. Meanwhile, the EMTs
showed up with oxygen. The baby was wrapped in my old pink
sweatshirt I keep in the car, and she was just precious.''
</P>
<P>
   Mom and baby proceeded to Bethesda, where both were pronounced
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The story was well told by Margaret, with much help from her
hands, so there could be no mistaking when she finished. And then
the mother, cradling tiny Aolani Namur in her arms, asked something
of Margaret in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wants me to tell you that she doesn't know what she would
have done because her husband is injured and cannot drive.''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, Margaret smiles, starts to say something and then
chokes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't get over it. Especially, since I took an EMT
course and flunked out.''

REALITY AND TELEVISION SEEN AS SIDES OF THE SAME COIN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So OK, we're a celebrity-driven culture, where people are famous
just for being famous. Why does our fascination with fame
crystallize around TV? In less than a year, we've had three
ambitious comedies on the theme of TV worship. TV rules, said ``The
Truman Show,'' and this is bad. Forget your troubles, c'mon get
happy with TV, said ``Pleasantville,'' and its protagonists did. In
its unassuming and even charming way, Ron Howard's ``EDtv'' reminds
us why TV is the devil we feel we have to make a deal with. TV is
today's great validator, the only validator that matters, really.
Today you're a schlep, tomorrow you're golden _ provided TV smiles
upon you. TV is the rubber stamp on your hand that gets you into
the club of People Who Matter. For at least 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Howard is too much the amiable and unpretentious entertainer to
lapse into earnest sermonizing. He casts his take on TV's takeover
as a romantic comedy that disarms us with its zaniness and
sweetness. There's a nice overlay of goofiness on the satire, but
make no mistake, Howard knows exactly where to go with the fertile
subject of reality-based TV, and goes there winningly, from the
moment the film's San Francisco-based cable channel named True TV
finds itself being clobbered by the Gardening Channel and decides
to fight back. Their weapon? Everyslob, a beer-drinking,
going-nowhere guy toward whom audience members can feel
unthreatened and superior.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Harrelson's VCR repairman thinks he's the perfect
candidate, and perhaps would be, except that the talent scouts
prefer his kid brother, Matthew McConaughey's videostore clerk
named Ed. Ed's not too crazy about the idea, but his brother
convinces him that round-the-clock TV exposure will make their
lives better. So Ed says yes. In contrast to Jim Carrey's Truman,
who didn't know he was on TV, Ed willingly allows the cameras in.
All Ed all day works fine for the ratings _ and for the
commercials, which ribbon across the bottom of the screen, starting
with local restaurants and amusingly escalating to national brands
as the audience grows.
</P>
<P>
   But Ed soon begins to regard the situation as a sort of
Pandora's box in reverse. As TV films Ed's life, TV becomes Ed's
life, neatly giving form to the central contradiction of so-called
reality-based TV. How can reality become entertainment, when
entertainment becomes reality? Not that Ed sits around pondering
these conundrums. He's too busy trying to keep his life together as
the cameras relentlessly begin to pull it apart. First, his yahoo
older brother sours with resentment that Ed and not he was the
chosen one. His rancor deepens when Ed finds himself getting close
emotionally to the girlfriend his brother ignores.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, inevitably, Ed and the girlfriend kiss. But what
should be a private moment is telecast to millions of homes, and
the romance never really gets the growing room it needs. What it
does get is a delightful performance by Jenna Elfman that's at once
gritty and buoyant. She's got enough backbone to take off when Ed
is told that 71 percent of the show's audience doesn't like her.
This leaves Ed to reluctantly be prodded into a strictly
made-for-TV romance with Elizabeth Hurley's actress on the make. It
also starts pulling his family apart.
</P>
<P>
   McConaughey and Harrelson groove on the lowlife brother
interplay and Sally Kirkland is on target as a self-justifying mom
whose rationales crumble when the husband she dumped, played by
Dennis Hopper, resurfaces with a bit of inconvenient revisionist
truth-telling. Funnier still is Martin Landau as the ailing second
hubby, scooting around in a wheelchair, running on the best lines
by the screenwriting team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, in
their best form of the '90s. But it's McConaughey's comic
zigzagging and Elfman's plucky sprite who give ``EDtv'' its vital
center.
</P>
<P>
   Considering all the moving parts in ``EDtv,'' Howard directs it
with remarkable nimbleness, especially when it comes to juggling
film and TV-within-a-film footage. He never hits the material (or
us) over the head. He has fun, too, with the controlling TV execs _
Ellen DeGeneres, who at least arrives at remorse, and Rob Reiner's
archfiend, who keeps fingering his necktie while saying things such
as, ``If it's dirty and it's true, we want it.'' Don't let the fact
that you may have seen ``The Truman Show'' or ``Pleasantville''
keep you away from this one. Those films were brilliantly stylized.
This one is much more down to earth, but just as appealing while
covering as much ground in its deceptively modest way. `EDtv'' is
juicy stuff served with a light touch.

MAN WITH LINKS TO O'HAIR FIGURE ARRESTED IN MICHIGAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A second ex-convict who is a possible figure in the 1995
disappearance of atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair was ordered held
without bond Friday on federal firearms charges.
</P>
<P>
   Gary P. Karr, 50, was arrested Wednesday after the police and
FBI agents searched his apartment in Novi, Mich., and found two
loaded firearms _ an RG Industries .22-caliber revolver and a
.25-caliber Raven Semi-Automatic pistol.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were found at his residence. The search warrant was
executed on Wednesday, the same day a search warrant was served on
Mr. David Waters in Austin,'' Darren Holmes, an FBI spokesman in
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Karr appeared Friday afternoon before a federal magistrate in
Detroit who ordered him held without bond.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, 52, who was once O'Hair's office manager in Austin, also
is being held without bond in Texas. The police and FBI discovered
119 rounds of ammunition in his Austin apartment on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were charged under the federal statute that makes it
illegal for a convicted felon to possess ammunition or firearms.
</P>
<P>
   For eight months in the mid-1980s, the two men were inmates at
the same minimum security prison in Vienna, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Waters and Karr have not been charged in connection with the
O'Hair case. But Waters' court-appointed attorney, Patrick Ganne,
said earlier this week that a federal prosecutor brought up the
disappearance of O'Hair and two of her adult children.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said you can get the death penalty for solicitation to
commit murder. He said he better get right with God and tell his
side of the story,'' said Ganne, referring to conversations with
Assistant U.S. Attorney Gerald Carruth in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Ganne also said that Carruth had told him that Waters had been
implicated in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said a bunch of people are rolling over on him and
implicating him in the murder of the O'Hair family,'' Ganne said.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth has declined to discuss his conversations with Ganne.
</P>
<P>
   Karr served more than 20 years in Illinois prisons as a result
of a spree of crimes, including rape, kidnapping and robbery, in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   Waters has prior convictions for murder, battery, forgery and
theft. The latter conviction came in 1995 after Waters stole
$54,000 from the O'Hair organizations while working as their office
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Waters was released in 1987. Karr left prison in May 1995, four
months before O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray and daughter Robin
Murray O'Hair disappeared in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The three vanished along with $500,000 in gold.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair had long lost the cultural prominence she relished in the
decades following the Supreme Court decisions of the early 1960s
that removed Bible reading and prayer from public schools.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of her disappearance, she was a sick and aging woman
who had become a marginal figure within atheist circles, and was
known to be contemplating retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it will become very clear that my mother, brother
and (Robin) did not take $500,000 and flee the country, that in
fact they were kidnapped and murdered for the money,'' said Bill
Murray, O'Hair's other son, who lives in Fredericksburg, Va. ``I
think this will help to give closure not only to me, but to all the
members of my mother's organizations who were led to believe she
just took their funds and absconded.''

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Florida man, Danny Fry, vanished at the same time as they
O'Hair family after spending September 1995 in San Antonio on a
mysterious errand. He had gone to Texas to work with Waters.
</P>
<P>
   Fry's family and relatives said Waters was not helpful after Fry
did not return to Florida as promised in early October 1995.
</P>
<P>
   His fate was not known until January of this year when DNA
testing indicated that a nude, headless and handless body found on
Oct. 2, 1995, east of Dallas was that of Fry.
</P>
<P>
   Waters has denied any knowledge of either the Fry or O'Hair
case.
</P>
<P>
   Theories on the O'Hair case have ranged from kidnapping and
murder to a self-imposed foreign exile sustained by funds drained
from her atheist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous bits of circumstantial evidence, however, suggest that
the Fry and O'Hair cases are connected. Additional evidence puts
Karr and Waters in San Antonio at about the same time in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone records also suggest extensive contact between Fry and
Waters earlier in 1995, and show that he stayed at Waters' Austin
apartment a month before O'Hair and her children vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Fry's last telephone call home, on Sept. 30, 1995, was made from
Waters' apartment. Less than 48 hours later, the mutilated body was
discovered 275 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   According to an affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in
Detroit on Thursday, Karr offered no resistance when police
confronted him Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests of Karr and Waters came as federal agents
simultaneously questioned people in Chicago and Fort Worth, Texas.
Only Karr and Waters have been charged.

SOUTHERN HAWKS GIVE WING TO DOUBTS ON BOMBING CAMPAIGN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Southern lawmakers are among the most outspoken
boosters of the U.S. military, but they were also the most vocal
critics of President Clinton's decision to bomb Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the air strikes have commenced, most lawmakers,
regardless of political affiliation, have tempered their criticism,
signaling their support for U.S. forces in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   But they are clearly uneasy about the air campaign, part of a
NATO-led effort to end the conflict in Kosovo, a province of
Yugoslavia where Albanians want their independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think we should be choosing sides in what amounts to
a very brutal civil war,'' said Sen. Strom Thurmond, a Republican
and former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The
venerable South Carolinian voted against a resolution supporting
the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution passed before the bombing runs began. But the
58-41 vote reflected congressional reluctance to intervene in the
Balkans dispute. Even Democrat Fritz Hollings of South Carolina
broke party ranks to vote against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Mack of Florida, Richard Shelby of Alabama and Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky were the only Southern Republicans in the
Senate to support it. But their comments were hardly a ringing
endorsement of Clinton's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby faulted the president for not articulating an ``exit
strategy'' and pursuing policies that put America's credibility at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   Mack said the White House should not misinterpret his position.
``My vote in favor of this deployment was not carte blanche for any
future military action the president may seek to undertake,'' said
Mack, who hit Clinton for failing to communicate both with Congress
and the public.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was the target at a Senate hearing where Republicans
criticized his record on prosecuting gun offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Subcommittee
on Youth Violence, offered statistics that showed federal
prosecutions of firearms violations involving drug and gang
criminals declined 46 percent between 1992 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``How President Clinton can justify calls for more gun control
laws when his Justice Department doesn't fully prosecute the gun
laws we have now is a mystery to me,'' Sessions, a critic of gun
control, wrote recently.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials said the decline reflected greater
coordination between state, local and federal officials. They said
state and local courts are targeting more of the lower-level
offenders, while federal officials are focusing on the bigger
cases.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton promised in a recent radio address
``to use every available tool to increase the prosecution of gun
criminals and shut down illegal gun markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Are 150 House Democrats firmly on the record in support of
racism? That is what Republicans are claiming in the wake of a
politically tortured vote on a resolution that condemned all forms
of bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the background: House Democrats, trying to embarrass
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi and House
impeachment advocate Bob Barr, R-Ga., introduced a resolution
condemning the Council of Conservative Citizens, a white
supremacist group that both Lott and Barr have spoken before.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans countered with a resolution attacking any and all
racism, saying Democrats fell short in just going after one group.
``We should not use this as a political tool,'' said Rep. J.C.
Watts, R-Okla., a black GOP leader and sponsor of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats rejected the GOP resolution, calling it a meaningless
political gesture. ``It does nothing real,'' said Rep. Robert
Wexler, D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans strategists hope to turn the vote against Democrats
next year, but Wexler and others say the party's record on civil
rights will insulate them from GOP attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Don't accuse Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., of letting bygones be
bygones.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Inglis, his opponent in last year's bitter Senate race, was
an advocate of term limits and stuck to his own vow of serving just
three terms in the House. He then ran for the Senate, arguing that
Hollings had overstayed his welcome. The attack obviously rankled,
judging by Hollings' response to a recent question on term-limit
advocates rethinking their pledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know, I had to run against all that last year,''
said Hollings, getting wound up as he remembered Inglis. ``He said
that he was going back and live under the laws that he had passed
and everything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact,'' declared Hollings, ``he wanted to come and live in
my house. I had to run him out.''

WHO IS GEORGE REGAN AND WHY IS HE TAKEN SO SERIOUSLY?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   His slicked-back hair is unlike any patchwork of reddish-brown
known to even the best colorists on Newbury Street _ the shade of
tree bark in some spots, what Martha Stewart might call fawn's fur
in others. When he talks in that machine gun, rat-a-tat,
nobody-can-barely-understand-me-but-hey-that's-okay way of his, he
punctuates each sentence with an unintentionally comical raise of
his eyebrows. Why? Who knows.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows. Who knows why George Regan, arguably the most
dominant public relations executive in Boston, chooses to be so
domineering. Who knows why he picks petty fights, savages
reputations, tries to tear down what others have built up.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, who knows why some of Boston's most serious people,
people of character and consequence, kneel so readily at his altar
of promising publicity and embrace him as a friend.
</P>
<P>
   In the whole of Boston politics, business and media, and that
murky area where the three inevitably and often intertwine, there
may be no more discussed figure than Regan, part huckster, part
old-fashioned press agent to the famous and frantic, part effective
strategist for the corporate elite.
</P>
<P>
   And he's at it all over again, a hurricane in perpetual search
of land, this time taking on the lobbying and public relations
titan Thomas P. O'Neill III, son of the late House speaker. Like a
car crash in the making, it is a collision that is painful to watch
but irresistible to see.
</P>
<P>
   Regan, according to O'Neill, told a potential client he was
about to hire away a prized publicist from O'Neill's company, and
then spread rumors that O'Neill's business was ailing. O'Neill
responded with a stern letter from his lawyer. Regan responded by
delightedly faxing the letter to anyone who asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``My company has to be protected, my clients have to be
protected,'' O'Neill said. ``When I find him doing something
inappropriate, I'm going to handle it professionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Regan: ``I wouldn't be surprised if Tommy O'Neill had a
used car lot behind his building.''
</P>
<P>
   Just another day in the life of George Regan. His success is
legend _ 130 active clients by his own count, $5 million in
reported fees last year. His friends are legion, extending down the
corridors of government power to the most prized corporate
boardrooms to the city's major newsrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Investigative and business reporters graze on his tips. Few are
the city's journalists who've had the pleasure of never meeting
him. Regan, a former spokesman for Kevin White, claims the Herald
as a client, and even has its former editor-in-chief, Alan Eisner,
as his company president.
</P>
<P>
   Within the tightly woven public relations community of Boston,
Regan isn't so much disliked as despised. ``He's deadly,'' says
Dusty Rhodes, a respected publicist. ``He takes down what you try
to build.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes knows first-hand. Her long-held plan to bring the Tall
Ships to Boston in July 2000 was nearly sunk by Regan, who was
hired by a Connecticut company with a competitive plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he was paid $10,000 a month,'' Rhodes says, in a
conversation confirmed by a witness. ``He said he was hired to
destroy Sail Boston, and if he had to, to destroy me.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Regan: ``I don't know what she was drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Regan, rival publicists express fear and scurry for
anonymity. They whisper about his relationship with the Herald,
about his penchant to generate negative news to prolong contracts.
They complain about a 1995 Globe profile of Regan they deemed too
positive, yet only one publicist _ Joe Burnieika _ agreed to be
quoted in that story by name. Burnieika says Regan has battered his
reputation ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Batting practice,'' Regan says of his swings at Burnieika.
Later, he calls to relay a supposed Burnieika transgression.
</P>
<P>
   Smart people sing Regan's praises. He counts as clients
BankBoston, Biogen, the Celtics, Robert Kraft, New Balance. ``You
call and he springs into action,'' says Massachusetts Turnpike
chairman James Kerasiotes. ``He's relentless.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Regan called 12 times  &UR; yesterday &LR;  attempting to
influence these words. Mutual associates telephoned out of the blue
to praise him. At one point, the nice manager of Ciao Bella _ a
Regan haunt _ was on the line with an offer of free dinner. Regan
is, by most accounts, a great friend to the worthy.
</P>
<P>
   All of which provides a lesson of sorts. Good reputations are
hard-earned, and in this era of media saturation, easily lost. So
why does Regan, so protective of his own reputation, so enjoy
tearing others down? The only answer isn't much of one at all. Who
knows.

THIS ``MOD SQUAD'' QUICKLY BECOMES A PLOD SQUAD
</HEADLINE>
 SQUAD-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Mod Squad'' brings to the big screen _ but not in a big
way _ the TV series that ran from 1968 to 1973 and was one of the
things that defined the medium's cool. The intended audience for
the new movie version is much too young to have watched the
original, except perhaps in reruns. Not that it's in any way
crucial because, frankly, the film's only point of similarity with
the original is that it, too, stars a black character named Linc
(Omar Epps), a white one named Pete (Giovanni Ribisi), and a blonde
named Julie (Claire Danes). There's something to be said for all
three, although more for Epps and Ribisi than for Danes, who never
seems comfortable enough to fully inhabit her role of an ex-junkie
trying to win her freedom and clear her record by going undercover
for the LA police.
</P>
<P>
   Epps is more than comfortable with his undercover assignment,
which consists mostly of looking, taking everything in, and
reacting a lot, but in internalized ways, never histrionically.
Ribisi is the hotdog who gets off on making it up as he goes along.
He brings a nice scatty energy to his role and curls the ends of
his lips into various expressive smirks. In short, all three show
up more than ready to work, but the case they're working on is
lame, predictable, and drawn out to numbing length. Its take on
dirty cops stealing and selling drugs from the police evidence
locker is the stuff that awns are made of. For an action film,
it's amazingly sluggish, and the club scenes, where the presumably
hip delinquents seem more out of place than on the streets, offers
little relief.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the problems stem from the low level of
inspiration in the screenplay, Scott Silver's choppy, disjointed
direction is another liability. Silver is best in capturing the
atomized atmosphere of the LA streets, where life seems to stand
still while cars go by. The problem is that ``The Mod Squad'' also
seems to stand still, all its back-and-forth notwithstanding.
Dennis Farina, as the cop who takes the trio under his wing,
injects some warmth in the beginning, and Michael Lerner, as a rock
promoter playing drug kingpin, supplies a touch of welcome
eccentricity at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, ``The Mod Squad'' plays like a very ordinary
half-hour cop show stretched into an hour and a half. It's hard not
to think of it as ``The Plod Squad.''

 By LEE REICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I have seen gardens which were all experiment, given over to
every new thing, and which produced little or nothing for the
owners, except the pleasure of expectation.'' With those
century-old words of wisdom from the essayist and editor Charles
Dudley Warner (``My Summer in a Garden,'' 1888) looming over me, I
still went ahead two years ago to devote 120 square feet of my
property to cherry tomatoes, almost two dozen varieties. I wanted
to see how different one variety was from the next in plant size
and health, and in fruit size, color and _ most important _ flavor.
</P>
<P>
   To most people, a cherry tomato is, well, just a cherry tomato.
</P>
<P>
   Even people who scour garden centers for special varieties of
full-size tomato plants will grow just about any old cherry tomato
offered. And no wonder. Although cherry tomatoes existed in Europe
as long ago as 1623, they have always been relatively unimportant,
grown mostly for curiosity or for pickles and preserves. Nowadays,
most of the crop turns up in salad bars, and then because they do
not need slicing.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry tomatoes are a subspecies of tomato, with round fruits
divided within into two cells. They usually dangle from the plants
in parallel, ropelike clusters, and they are small, generally the
size of a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   My journey into the land of cherry tomatoes began on a winter
evening, while I was studying seed catalogs, in which I found a
good selection of red and yellow varieties. Most of my seeds came
from two specialists, Tomato Growers Supply Co. (P.O. Box 2237,
Fort Myers, Fla. 33902; 888-478-7333; free catalog) and Totally
Tomatoes (P.O. Box 1626, Augusta, Ga. 30903; 803-663-0016; free
catalog).
</P>
<P>
   The site I selected was bathed in sunlight from morning until
midafternoon, with a deep loam soil that had been enriched annually
with horse manure, hay and leaves. In short, perfect.
</P>
<P>
   I started plants indoors in mid-April, and shortly after the
seedlings were transplanted outdoors, warm, sunny weather spurred
growth. The plants had to be pruned to prevent congestion in some
of the tomato cages I used (5-foot-tall cylinders 18 inches in
diameter, made of concrete reinforcement wire with a 6-by-6-inch
mesh). As I pruned, pronounced differences among varieties became
evident. Varieties like Peace Vine, Camp Joy and Red Cherry Large
were reaching out the sides of their cages and eventually spilled
over the tops. Bushy vines of Baxter's Bush and Husky Red rose
neatly and slowly, like green cylinders, within their cages. Red
Robin looked ridiculous, a plant only 8 inches high by 8 inches
wide within a giant cage.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff to my hours of planning, planting and care began in
the middle of July, when the first fruits began to ripen _ on
Cheerio and Chello. The red Cheerio was tart, without any
counterbalancing sweetness, which the yellow Chello did have,
making it a bit better tasting.
</P>
<P>
   That first small wave of ripening was followed in a week or so
by subsequent waves.
</P>
<P>
   Whippersnapper lived up to its name, with insipid taste and
color, and Presto was tart but palatable. Finally, by mid-August,
all the plants were bearing well, and I could start comparing their
fruits. The differences were striking, in size, color and flavor.
And good flavor generally was not a pervasive quality. Most were
just plain acidic, lacking character, richness or sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   As I sampled, the phrase ``Tastes too much like a market or
salad bar cherry tomato'' kept running through my head, summing up
my benchmarks for bad cherry tomatoes. I later learned, in talking
with tomato breeders, that the leading commercial cherry tomato,
making up perhaps 75 percent of all sales, is Cherry Grande. It
looks pretty and ships well, but its mushy texture and acidic
flavor cause most tomato breeders to wince.
</P>
<P>
   A few plants bore delicious fruits. Most of the Sweet Million,
Sun Gold, Sun Cherry and Gardener's Delight fruits never reached
the kitchen. I could not resist the temptation to pop them into my
mouth as I harvested.
</P>
<P>
   Things changed as late summer weather turned cool and moist. The
flavors of Red Cherry Large, Washington and Fox Cherry improved
somewhat from their summer mediocrity. By early fall, the Gold
Nugget, Sweet Million, Red Robin, Whippersnapper, Chello and Early
Cascade plants had collapsed, dead or nearly so, and most others
were yielding only occasional fruits. But Sun Gold and to a lesser
extent Sun Cherry kept ripening great-tasting fruits.
</P>
<P>
   By summer's end, I could hear Charles Dudley Warner's ghost
nagging me, asking whether I thought that my bevy of cherry tomato
plants was a waste of space. OK, yes. Although cherry tomatoes are
fun to eat, lovely to look at and easy to grow, 20 plants were too
many. And most were pretty bad-tasting.
</P>
<P>
   Which would I grow again? For a neat plant, hardly requiring
pruning, with dark green leaves well into fall, it would be Husky
Red, even with its average flavor. Presto was notable for its
productivity. My all-around favorite, though, was Sun Gold. It was
productive and disease-free well into fall, and its beautiful,
persimmon-orange fruits held superb flavor even if not picked
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   If you grow cherry tomatoes, plan on two or three plants a
person, and choose varieties with care. Only the best are worth
growing.

WHEN FLYING TOURIST MEANT GOING IN STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 28)  
 (af)  
 By RICK MARIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people made fun of Sean Penn for his widely leaked letter
to 20th Century Fox complaining that the studio wouldn't give him a
private jet for a publicity trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you guys don't remember what the inside of a commercial
airline terminal looks like, but if you send me a picture of your
jets, I'll send you a picture of the door at the Red Carpet Room,''
he wrote, somewhat cryptically. Rather than accept the indignity of
a $2,000 first-class ticket, he canceled the trip. His ``cc'' list
at the bottom of the letter included Rupert Murdoch and ``God
Almighty.'' This from a guy who posed for Vanity Fair in front of
his trailer home.
</P>
<P>
   But he's got a point. There is no greater indignity than
commercial air travel. Multi-hour delays are imposed without
apology or extra peanuts. Flight attendants have all the charm of
hall monitors. The term ``jet set'' now means a matching sweat-suit
ensemble. I've seen more style-savvy passengers on the casino bus
to Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   The plummeting dress code on your average 737 may sound like a
superficial gripe in the larger context of crippling pilot strikes
and $4 headsets. But I would argue that the relentless
unstylishness of the in-flight experience is the problem, from
barefoot passengers to the cabin crew's Salvation Army-drab
uniforms to the goats and chickens roaming around the back of the
plane. And Exhibit A is my most recent sartorial nightmare in the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   Long story short: Settling into American Airlines flight 662
from San Juan, P.R., to Kennedy airport last week, my traveling
companion smells a smell euphemistically known as ``air sickness.''
Flight attendant says we're ``free to switch seats,'' except plane
is way overbooked. A couple of hours later, companion notices trace
of so-called air sickness on her coat.
</P>
<P>
   Further investigation reveals similarly soiled spot on cabin
wall, just below window seat. Deplaning at JFK, feel wet on leg,
look down, see and smell huge patches of aforementioned substance
on jeans and tennis bag. Bag was in overhead compartment. Complain
to supervisor at the gate. He apologizes, scrawls name and these
words on scrap of paper: ``Please honor cleaning voucher.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you've ever walked off an airplane covered in someone
else's vomit, you know that a cleaning voucher doesn't really cut
it in the compensation department. Maybe this sort of thing happens
all the time, but such appalling behavior didn't use to be
considered the minor inconvenience of a discount fare.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always a vile-high club. Anyone over 30 remembers when
flying was a first-class event, no matter how much the ticket cost.
Men wore jackets and ties. Women decked themselves out in fancy
frocks and and travel suits. Even children were cleaned up and
pressed into their Sunday best. Out of consideration for child-free
travelers, babies were deemed too young to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Craving proof that these halcyon days of civilized airborne
transport really existed, I've been poring over back issues of
Holiday, a defunct travel monthly published from 1946 to 1977.
</P>
<P>
   I first came across it last year, while going through my
father's stuff after he died. He had saved an issue from 1965
because of its cover story on Spain, his native country. About a
month ago, I found another copy (also 1965) at a junk arcade in
Cold Spring, N.Y., with a piece by Bruce Jay Friedman (on this
crazy new music called rock-and-roll) and a dyspeptic Mordecai
Richler dispatch from the Catskills illustrated by Arnold Roth.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday had an impressive stable of contributors _ John
Steinbeck, John O'Hara, Alfred Kazin, Kenneth Tynan _ and an
arrestingly modern look: huge color photographs and acres of white
space around the text. But just as eye-catching in the pages of
this oversize glossy are the ads. They are a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Peck and Marlene Dietrich endorse the ``divine'' Air
France. Pan Am stewardesses wear Pucci uniforms. In a joint
advertorial for American Airlines and American Tourister, shot on
location at Kennedy, razor-sharp Rat Pack types clutch glamorous
women in furs.
</P>
<P>
   These chic young ladies are invariably equipped with a
half-dozen pieces of matching luggage that put to shame the boring
black boxes their daughters now wheel around _ the carry-on
equivalent of sensible shoes. As in Holiday's full-page Technicolor
pitches for Cadillac, Chris-Craft and Martini &AMP; Rossi, Madison
Avenue offers up flying the friendly skies as one more piece of the
post-war good life.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the sexiest airline ads tell you how many
frequent-flier miles you get if you take the US Airways shuttle
before April 1. It's all about the miles now, a volume business
where service and style take a backseat, near the bathroom, the one
that always says ``Occupied.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone could afford to fly in those days _ just as not
everyone could afford a television set. Now, anyone can. Having
survived its slump, the airline industry is earning record profits.
Many carriers are squeezing their coach sections to make more room
for rich passengers or lap-topped ``road warriors'' with millions
of miles on their plutonium cards.
</P>
<P>
   A big deal is made out of the widening disparity between coach
and first. You know what the difference is? About 20 lousy inches
between seats, a mug for your bad coffee, and a choice of movies on
hand-held, unwatchably small screens.
</P>
<P>
   Far from becoming more classist, flying, like television, has
been democratized to the lowest common denominator. First and
business classes are coach with warm nuts _ filled with slovenly
adults and ill-mannered children. That's why Sean Penn, and anyone
in his tax bracket, has a horror of flying commercial.
</P>
<P>
   But flipping through Holiday's transporting pages, you have to
believe that if more passengers wore snappy mohair suits and mink
stoles to get on a plane, classless fliers would at least be less
frequent.

ITALIAN GETS INTO HOT WATER AT ISTANBUL STEAM BATH
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Steam'' rejiggers the familiar story of urban ennui swept away
by emotional authenticity and revitalizing contact with a different
culture. In this case, it's a journey to Istanbul that snaps
Alessandro Gassman's Roman designer, Francesco, out of the
doldrums. He's prosperous but pressured. His marriage to Francesca
d'Aloja's Marta is in a jangly state, too. So when he gets word
that an aunt in Istanbul has died and left him a steam bath, he's
more than ready to take a break to go there and sell it.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrives, though, he's disarmed by the homey warmth of
the hospitable Turkish custodian and his family living in the
building. And he finds his resistance to selling stiffened when he
learns that the prospective buyer is grabbing up the whole
neighborhood and plans to displace its working-class _ which is to
say politically cloutless _ inhabitants. What really makes him want
to stay around, however, is his homoerotic attraction to the
family's languid young son, Mehmet, who leads him into the
otherwise-forbidden pleasures of the male-only baths, accompanied
by dervish music on the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   When Marta arrives to find out what's taking Francesco so long,
and also to tell him she's been having an affair with their
business partner and wants a divorce, she finds she likes the new
version of her husband, who presumbaly has been humanized by
finally getting his sexual preferences, so to speak, straight.
Essentially, it's a banal story made interesting by views of
Istanbul that leave the usual tourist sites and move into the
neighborhoods, and by Francesco's delving into his late aunt's
letter and diaries.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out she was a passionate and venturesome creature who
reveled in her own eroticism, and Francesco feels a kinship with
her. It makes the otherwise-standard angst of both Francesco and
Marta a shade more interesting and makes them seem marginally less
like characters cut from an old Antonioni movie. Halil Ergun and
Serif Sezer are very sympathetic as the parents of the Turkish
family that befriends Francesco. As the latter, Gassman, son of
Vittorio, shows us just enough to make us want to see what else he
can do. But as ``Steam'' goes its predictable way, we can't help
feeling that it's telling the wrong story, that of the nephew and
not the far more interesting dead aunt.

DEPTH MISSING FROM BENING'S `HEDDA GABLER'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the new Geffen Playhouse production of Henrik
Ibsen's ``Hedda Gabler,'' Annette Bening first appears before us
barefoot in a white nightgown, an ethereal, bewitching presence.
</P>
<P>
   It's night, and Bening's title character glides wordlessly
through her provincial Norwegian home, pausing before a full-length
portrait of her father, whose gray general's uniform makes him look
a bit like a Scandinavian Robert E. Lee. Before drifting off stage,
she stops before a looking glass to examine her own nocturnal
reflection, as if trying to fathom the spiritual kinship between
the rugged old warrior hanging in the hallway and the high-strung,
sexually explosive woman in the darkened mirror.
</P>
<P>
   This haunting prologue, not in Ibsen's original text, is by far
the most poetic and psychologically reverberant interlude in Dan
Sullivan's disappointingly tepid production of Ibsen's robust 1890
tragicomedy. Unfortunately, little that follows in the next 2{
hours comes near that level of dramatic invention or emotional
penetration.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Bening herself, making a welcome return to live theater
after nearly a decade's absence, as mysteriously compelling as she
is in those first spectral moments. Like the production as a whole
_ at least, at Wednesday night's opening _ Bening's performance
feels tentative, more transparent than revealing, unsure of who
exactly that trapped, angry woman in the mirror is supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   And while Jon Robin Baitz's crisp, conversational new
translation gives Ibsen's words a lively contemporary ring, the
production tends to flatten out the play's repressive, 19th-century
dimensions, reducing the characters to humdrum middle-class
suburban neurotics. Like Riccardo Hernandez's set design, blockily
compressed by the Geffen proscenium, the production can't break
free of a constricted conceptual framework.
</P>
<P>
   An accomplished and versatile stage actress before taking up
residence in Hollywood, Bening would seem a logical, even inspired
choice to portray Ibsen's doomed, defiant heroine. In films, she
has painted memorable closeups of femme fatales whose fierce
sensuality is equaled by their diamond-hard willpower, whose
ingenue charms are underpinned with lethal cunning.
</P>
<P>
   Similar traits are constantly jostling with each other in Hedda,
the smart, spoiled, headstrong general's daughter _ a 19th-century
army brat, if you will _ who somehow has ended up married to the
wonky academic George Tesman (Byron Jennings). House-bound in the
dull, sub-arctic outback, where she's almost literally dying of
ennui, Hedda has few amusements left save her father's old dueling
pistols, which she enjoys firing over the heads of unsuspecting
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   If she hadn't unwisely sought wealth, social position and a
man's privileges in her conventional marriage, Hedda still might be
keeping company with her old flame, the dashingly debauched Elert
Lovborg (a somewhat subdued Patrick O'Connell). But Lovborg, the
unreconstructed ladies' man, has been heating up a dangerous
liaison of his own with the married Thea Elvsted (Carolyn
McCormick), who has replaced Hedda as his intellectual comrade and
romantic sparring partner.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings' splendidly feeble turn as absent-minded professor
Tesman reminds us that ``Hedda Gabler'' is a comedy, albeit a
comedy that ends with two people dead of gunshot wounds. Few
playwrights have captured smothering domesticity better than the
author of ``A Doll's House,'' and it is on this level that
Sullivan's direction is at its most entertainingly assured.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bening's Hedda is seldom in sync with these rhythms. On
Wednesday the actress's line readings were stiff and dynamically
limited. Her physical mannerisms _ an arm cocked on one hip, her
body weight propped against a settee for support _ were
distracting, making this ordinarily lithesome performer appear
self-conscious, off-balance.
</P>
<P>
   The keen, skeptical intelligence Bening radiates makes it hard
for her to persuade us she really believes Hedda's dotty romantic
delusions about Lovborg being a Dionysiac rebel with ``vine leaves
in his hair.'' Although her performance grew stronger as the night
went on, Bening hasn't yet tapped into the specific nature of
Hedda's insult, the depth of her (partially self-inflicted)
lifelong wound.
</P>
<P>
   Of the strong ensemble, Paul Guilfoyle manages to make the
cynical, manipulative Judge Brack surprisingly funny and human, all
too human. McCormick, who was so effective opposite Frank Langella
in last season's Geffen production of Strindberg's ``The Father,''
is every bit as persuasive here as Hedda's saner romantic rival.
</P>
<P>
   There's a decent chance this production will deliver a much
bigger bang by the time it closes in April. With an actress of
Bening's skill calling the shots, you know there's a terrific
reservoir of firepower in there somewhere. &QL;

MENDOCINO WINES: `OUR TIME HAS COME' 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill.)  By MIKE GENIELLA   
 THE PRESS DEMOCRAT OF SANTA ROSA, CALIF.  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOPLAND, Calif. _ Flush with rising prices and growing
recognition for locally grown wine grapes, Mendocino County growers
are helping underwrite the county's first national promotional
campaign in a bid to garner the kind of attention usually paid to
Napa and Sonoma counties.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 17 wineries have signed up to participate with local
growers in the first ever ``Mendocino Bounty'' tasting outside of
California. It's scheduled for June 10 in Chicago, the first stop
on a planned three-year national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our time has come,'' said John Enquist, new executive director
of the Mendocino Winegrowers Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The national campaign is a collaborative effort of the local
wine industry and a new organization formed by the county's
tourist-related businesses.
</P>
<P>
   After a four-year planning effort, and aided by a $275,000 grant
from the county Board of Supervisors, the Mendocino effort is seen
as an important step in securing national recognition for the local
wine industry.
</P>
<P>
   John Dickerson, president of Mendocino County Promotional
Alliance, said it may take three years before Mendocino wine and
tourism-related businesses see fruits of the national promotional
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all we have to do is look to Napa and Sonoma, which spend
millions and millions of dollars every year on promotion, to see
what it has meant to growers and the lodging industry there,'' said
Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson said national recognition of Mendocino's wine industry
is bound to help the overall county economy in the face of a
dwindling timber industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wine and tourist industries are helping replace the lost
jobs,'' said Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson and others see the possibility of even more local jobs
if the county wine industry can succeed in reversing the flow of
grapes to wineries outside Mendocino County. Currently, about 50
percent of the total grape tonnage grown in Mendocino is processed
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could cut that export to 25 percent, and produce more
wines locally, we'd create hundreds of new jobs here instead of in
neighboring counties,'' Dickerson said.

 By ELIZABETH HAYT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before leading services at Central Synagogue in
Manhattan, Rabbi Jill Kreitman, 35, performs a few rituals: she
splashes on Spring Flower perfume by Creed, applies Stila lipstick
and slips on flats by Prada or Gucci. ``When you have to get up to
take out the Torah from the Holy Ark during services, you don't
want to be wobbly,'' Kreitman said. She also irons her hair,
because, she adds, the light on the pulpit ``tends to accentuate
the frizzies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Christine McSpadden, 35, a priest at St. Bartholomew's
Church on Park Avenue, reads Vogue, wears black and has three
piercings in one ear. She jazzes up the traditional Episcopal shirt
and collar with a bugle-beaded cardigan and a rhinestone barrette a
la Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always stood out in Connecticut,'' Ms. McSpadden said of her
home state, where she said priests who are women usually wore
clerical shirts with prim dirndl skirts and Shetland sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   Women who are spiritual leaders, one might imagine, would be too
preoccupied with crises of faith to concern themselves with crises
of fashion. But many of those who are rabbis and ministers are
careful not to overlook matters like nail polish, hem lengths, heel
heights and hair color. They do so at some risk.
</P>
<P>
   When Rabbi Mychal Springer, 33, director of pastoral care and
education at Beth Israel Medical Center, wore an above-the-knee
skirt to work one day, an Orthodox woman recoiled, lambasting her
in front of patients and staff members. ``You're not a rabbi _ your
skirt is too short!'' Springer recalled the woman as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Her reply today: ``So if my skirt was longer, I'd be a rabbi?''
</P>
<P>
   As more and more women have entered the clergy over the last
three decades, a question that leaders of age-old faiths never much
pondered is being asked every day: What will I wear?
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly 500 rabbis nationwide who are women and the
Episcopal Church has 1,500 active priests who are women. The issue
of how to present themselves in public, to strike a balance between
decorum and worldliness, is an open-ended one. A clergywoman, many
say, can't look tarty, dowdy, girly or overly ``mannish.'' To break
through what Ms. McSpadden has called ``the stained-glass ceiling''
and rise in a denomination's hierarchy, even a woman's hairstyle
has to be right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus wasn't big on style,'' said the Rev. Joanna Adams, 54,
senior pastor of Trinity Presbyterian Church in Atlanta, who has
her nails done every week, always in a pastel. ``But women in the
clergy live in the real world, and a part of who we are is how we
present ourselves. Appearance isn't everything, but at the same
time, loveliness is not a sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressing for services poses the least conflict. Both Christians
and Jews say they feel comfortable wearing the flowing unisex
liturgical robes that allow clergywomen to blend easily with the
men. The plain robes are traditionally worn with other ornate
vestments, which many women use as style statements. An embroidered
prayer shawl or lace? Yarmulkes in white crochet, plaid or gold?
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Berle Ingram, a United Methodist minister and a
doctoral candidate at Union Theological Seminary, said that some
clergywomen drape colorful stoles around their shoulders for a more
feminine effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Lent, the color that the ministry wears in their stoles is
purple,'' she said. ``With more and more women, I have noticed
there are a variety of shades of purple, lavender, gradations of
pink, and stoles with fuchsia highlights. It's a way of making
softer or bolder statements, and looking more individual. Men are
starting to do this, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Feminizing the traditional garb has its share of pitfalls. ``You
don't know how many times I've gotten lipstick on my tallis,'' said
Kreitman, referring to the Jewish prayer shawl. ``It must be so
hard for a woman priest not to get make-up on her collar.''
</P>
<P>
   How to dress off the pulpit is the real problem. ``The issue is
sexuality,'' Springer said. ``Clergy are not supposed to be sexual
beings. Clothing hints at a private sexuality, and that's very
threatening.''

 NEW YORK: very threatening.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women who are rabbis and ministers agree that they cannot look
like sexpots. As role models in their communities who are on duty
all the time, clergywomen cannot run from the gym to the post
office in a tank top and Lycra shorts. The challenge is to look
modern, yet modest.
</P>
<P>
   One misstep and their congregants can be brutal fashion critics.
``I received complaints that a female rabbi was wearing sandals,
and that another one, who was officiating at a wedding, wasn't
wearing stockings,'' said Rabbi Mordechai Liebling, 50, senior
consultant to the Jewish Reconstructionist Federation in
Philadelphia. ``People who are having trouble with women rabbis
will focus on another area to voice their complaints. A woman's
dress is the most socially acceptable way to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Even something so small as a belt can be seen as a problem. When
the Rev. Denise Haines, 59, an Episcopal priest, was being
interviewed as a candidate in an election for bishop 10 years ago,
she wore a black dress with a slight V-neck, allowing her to wear a
clerical shirt and collar underneath. The dress was cinched at the
waist with a narrow belt. Although the outfit was hardly
suggestive, it did reveal the contours of her figure. Ms. Haines
lost the election, and later got word that one of the reasons might
have been her dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``A male priest said to me, `Some of us were not comfortable
with what you wore,''' said Ms. Haines, who is now the director of
community education and outreach at the Healthcare Chaplaincy in
Manhattan. ``I had a dress with a waist, and you could see that I
have breasts. It's hard for people to get past that when they're
trying to rethink roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Tight sweaters are taboo, Ms. Ingram confirmed. ``Right now,
there is so much sensitivity to appropriate sexual behavior for the
clergy, and dress is a part of that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Provocative, no. Approachable, yes _ which often means being in
style synch with congregants. For Rabbi Sherre Zwelling, 30, a
rabbi at Sinai Temple, the synagogue in West Los Angeles favored by
Hollywood's rich and famous, that means wearing ensembles by
designers like Helmut Lang, Armani and Donna Karan. Clothes become
a point of connection with the congregants. ``A woman will talk to
me about my lipstick and makeup and then confide in me that her
husband abuses her,'' Zwelling said. ``A conversation might open
with a congregant asking me, `Did you get those shoes at Prada?'
and then move on to her telling me about her eating disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   Each clergywoman draws her own line between what is appropriate
and what is over the top for a credible servant of God. ``You can't
wear the latest Versace,'' said Kreitman, who serves a well-to-do
Manhattan congregation. She opts for conservative Ralph Lauren
suits. ``Now that skirt lengths are longer and three-quarter
sleeves are in, we look like we've just walked out of the pages of
Vogue,'' she added, smoothing the highlighted bob she has cut and
colored at Bumble &AMP; Bumble.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, where tailored black is always in, clerical garb
can be inadvertently fashionable. Ms. McSpadden went to a party
recently where several young professionals asked her what she did
for a living. When she told them she was a priest, they were
surprised, despite the fact that she was wearing her black shirt
and collar.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought my clothes were some funky, East Village style,
like a Nehru jacket,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   People not used to seeing priests who are women often mistake
them for nuns. To prevent such errors, some women wear colored
clerical shirts cut for the female figure. But Canon Anne Richards,
48, of the Episcopal Diocese of New York and an assistant to the
bishop, says she sticks to the basic black and white look. ``Jesus
said, `Be like the lilies of the field' _ they don't care what they
wear,'' she remarked.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the canon allows herself one style indulgence.
With her gray Barami suit, she wears purple buttons on her black
vest, to send a message that she is representing the bishop, who
wears purple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't wear red,'' she said. ``It sends a Madison Avenue
message, a power suit message.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Strong winds from the north gusted as high as 60 mph in the
canyons of southern California Friday as potent low pressure aloft
drifted southeast across the Gulf of California toward Mexico. On
Saturday, the lethargic low will head across Mexico toward the
lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms, some with heavy rains, will develop
across parts of south Texas as increasingly moist air from the Gulf
of Mexico is lifted by the approaching system. Lifting will also be
enhanced by the westward sloping terrain. As a result, rainfalls of
one inch or more are possible in some areas of southern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the sluggish low-pressure system that produced snow
in the mountains of North Carolina on Friday will continue to drift
northeast across the Middle Atlantic states. Rain will likely
spread from northeast North Carolina to parts of southern New
Jersey. Whether precipitation penetrates farther inland over the
northern Middle Atlantic states will depend on the somewhat erratic
path of the system. Nonetheless, patchy sleet or wet snow could mix
with rain over some inland locations.
</P>
<P>
   The recent warm spell across the northern Plains will ebb in the
wake of a cool front crossing the Dakotas. Showers will be rather
limited along and ahead of the front because much of the available
moisture will be intercepted by the showers and thunderstorms in
southern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Light to occasionally moderate rains and mountain snows will
speckle the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Brimming Back Bays
</P>
<P>
   Minor tidal flooding is possible Saturday in back bays and
inlets near the Delaware and New Jersey coasts. But any flooding
that occurs will not result from fierce ocean winds pushing water
rapidly onto land. Flooding could occur because moderate but
protracted onshore winds will prevent bays and inlets from draining
at times of low tide. Thus, with water almost brimming in a few
bays and inlets at low tide, rising tides could send water spilling
onto land. Protracted ocean winds will be maintained by high
pressure over the Great Lakes and a modest low moving slowly north
along the coast.

DOCUMENTARY GIVE EXPERIMENTAL FILMMAKER HIS DUE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stan Brakhage's filmmaking began during America's great postwar
age of artistic experimentation that gave us John Cage, Allen
Ginsberg, Ornette Coleman, and a host of other American mavericks.
Of them all, Brakhage is still working, wearing lightly his laurels
as America's patriarch of experimental cinema. Not well known to
the public, he cuts a wide swath through academic circles and among
avant-garde filmmakers. He still shows up at festivals, bearded,
strong-profiled, wearing his trademark wide-brimmed hat and
photographer's vest, the kind that looks like a safari jacket with
sleeves cut off and a lot of pockets stuffed with rolls of film and
other gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brakhage,'' Jim Shedden's documentary overview of Brakhage and
his work, is a useful and long-overdue introduction that should
gain Brakhage the wider appreciation he has earned as a major
influence on the aesthetics of cinema. It didn't take him long to
align with such predecessors as Maya Deren and Kenneth Anger as a
filmer of psychodramas. They began with figurative images
transformed into inward-looking abstractions. Later, he moved
toward more primal shapes and colors and rhythms, keyed to the way
the eye and mind perceive. In going abstract, he founded, in the
words of one of his collaborators, Phil Solomon, a radical poetics.
Yet his films always remained personal.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them dealt with the Colorado mountains where he lived.
Many featured his first wife, Jane, and their five children. Later,
one of his grown children comments that far from minding that he
was photographed, he liked it because it was one of the few times
he could count on his father's attention. One of the most
entrancing of Brakhage's more than 300 short films (and a few long
ones) is of his two young daughters in yellow skirts and red
patterened blouses running through a grassy yard, hypnotic in the
play of rhythms involving color and motion. His first controversial
film was ``Window Water Baby Moving'' . It depicted his wife's
natural childbirth and annoyed Deren, who said he should not so
freely have revealed women's secrets.
</P>
<P>
   But Jane says she loved having babies and that the film offered
more information on childbirth than any other film had. Many years
later, Brakhage's second wife, Marilyn, lifted a great weight from
his shoulders, Brakhage says, when she refused to be photographed.
But, in the one soundbite she permits Shedden, she sheds light on
her husband's oeuvre, observing that he extended the Abstract
Expressionist movement by adding light and movement to it. This
became unmistakably apparent in his ``Prelude: Dog Star Man'' of
1961, in which he emblazoned across the screen a personalized
cosmology combining abstract color applications, distorted
naturalistic images of trees, and a new plasticity that involved
altering the film stock itself.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, his populist imperative of filming on 8mm in order
to raise the level of home movies to art did little to increase
awareness of his work, especially when the camcorder crowded 8mm
out of the picture and Brakhage refused to switch to video. He
persevered, producing a succession of works ranging from ``Song 7''
of 1964, a lyrical evocation of San Francisco, to ``The Art of
Seeing with One's Own Eyes'' (1971), focusing on an autopsy in a
Pittsburgh morgue. The last, he says, was his way of coming to
grips with the Vietnam War. As the black in his hair and beard
turns to gray, he weathers several more crises, including becoming
spooked enough by the mountains to move to the lower and more
benign elevation of Boulder, then surviving an eye operation.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Brakhage becomes more patriarchal, more at ease
in the company of adoring acolytes and collaborators, more at ease
with himself. He gave up hand-painting his films when he suspected
the chemicals in the paints gave him bladder cancer, which he
survived. From that point on, he has simply scratched designs with
etching tools directly onto film leader. Indeed, some of his later
abstract films seem little different from scratched-up leaders that
flash on-screen before films begin. In the end, Brakhage pokes fun
of the process of making pronouncements during interviews. He
doesn't know why he keeps making films, he says, except that he's
compulsively drawn to it, and that it is, in any case, a mystery.
Fair enough. And this documentary, which mimics Brakhage's rhythms,
images, and exposure schemes, is more than fair enough. It's good
to have around.

MOMENT OF TRUTH COMES SATURDAY FOR SEA LAUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
 LEDE-SPI   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Fixes time element in headline and lede.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the equatorial waters of the Pacific Ocean near Christmas
Island, a 208-foot-long Ukrainian-Russian Zenit 3SL rocket is set
to blast off Saturday today from a 20-story high North Sea oil rig
that has been converted into a one-of-a-kind space port.
</P>
<P>
   If the historic demonstration launch is successful, it could
give The Boeing Co., principal partner in the venture known as Sea
Launch, a competitive advantage in its goal of being the world's
premier provider of satellite launch vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But the success of this initial test of the Sea Launch system is
anything but a sure bet. The rocket has had several failures, and
another would be a major setback for Sea Launch, industry experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   The eyes of the world's satellite industry will be watching.
</P>
<P>
   The launch can be seen live on the Internet, at Boeing's Web
site, www.boeing.com. It is scheduled for 2:18 p.m. PST.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of an exciting new era in commercial
space launch activity,'' FAA Administrator Jane Garvey said last
week when the federal regulatory agency announced it had issued a
launch license to the Boeing-led consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications is potentially a $100-billion business, and
the commercial launch business for communication satellites is
exploding. There are many different launch vehicles available to
satellite customers today. More are in development. But there is
stiff competition for the limited number of ground-based launch
sites around the world.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the real significance of Sea Launch and the reason
the program is potentially so important to Boeing, said Marco
Caceres, aerospace analyst with the Teal Group, a market research
firm in Virginia. His speciality is commercial launch vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This platform in the middle of the ocean is really a
commercial space port,'' Caceres said. ``Boeing will have the
advantage of not having to wait in line to launch commercial
payloads because of backups at ground launch sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it will not say so officially, Boeing reportedly has so
far invested upwards of $500 million in Sea Launch, a 40 percent
stake.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is a partner in Sea Launch with the Norwegian shipbuilder
Kvaerner (20 percent); Russia's RSC-Energia (25 percent); and the
Ukrainian company Yuzhnoye/Yuzhmash (15 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Energia is the company that launched the first Sputnik and
designed the Russian Mir space station.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some industry speculation in recent months that
Boeing may not be committed, in the long term, to Sea Launch
because it will be years before the program could be expected to
make a profit. Earlier this year, Boeing executives, who are under
fire to make the company more profitable, announced a sweeping
initiative to identify programs that are not of value to the
company.
</P>
<P>
   In a March 5 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Boeing said development and administrative losses related to the
Sea Launch program were dragging down returns from the company's
space and defense business, and the losses will continue in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technical failure on the initial launch could substantially
impair the prospect for additional customers' acceptance and could
consequently result in significant reduction to the value of the
Sea Launch program assets,'' Boeing cautioned in its SEC filing.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing corporate spokesman Larry McCracken would not say if Sea
Launch is one of the programs that will be scrutinized. But because
the program is just getting started, it will take time to assess
its financial success, he said. Only then would it be fair to look
more closely at the program's margins and costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Caceres said he believes Boeing will stay with Sea Launch for
the long haul. But it could be five years or more before the
program shows a profit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how the market develops,'' Caceres said. And
that will determine the all-important number of yearly launches.
</P>
<P>
   Sea Launch officials have said they hope to initially launch six
to eight rockets a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, any company getting involved in launch services is
not looking to turn a profit quickly,'' Caceres said. ``The
short-term value for Boeing is not that you have another launch
vehicle with Sea Launch, but an independent launch site. That's
something that very few private companies can claim.''
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Sea Launch is the launch platform known as
Odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   The self-propelled platform is a former North Sea oil drilling
platform, which was refurbished at a shipyard in Norway. It is 436
feet long and 220 feet wide, and can cruise along on pontoons
larger than a Trident submarine at a speedy 13 knots.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Odyssey, the Sea Launch project also includes
the Sea Commander, a 660-foot, specially designed rocket-assembly
and mission control ship.
</P>
<P>
   Home port for both vessels is Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   For the initial launch tomorrow, the total crew for both vessels
is about 320 people, half Russians and Ukrainians. The 70 people on
the Odyssey will be transferred to the command ship before the
rocket blast off.
</P>
<P>
   For launch, the Odyssey will be lowered 65 feet more in the
water to provide more stability.
</P>
<P>
   The site in the middle of the Pacific was picked because it is
on the equator, where the Earth's surface is rotating eastward at
better than 1,000 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   A rocket fired there takes less fuel to reach the 17,500 mph
velocity necessary for orbit because the rocket is able to get the
maximum boost from the Earth's rotation. Less rocket fuel means
less weight, which allows increased payload capacity. What it all
adds up to is that a rocket launched from Odyssey can carry a
heavier satellite at less cost to the customer _ the key selling
point for Sea Launch.
</P>
<P>
   The project was conceived to win contracts from such
California-based satellite companies as Hughes. They can save money
because they don't have to pay the cost of transporting their
satellites to far-away launch sites in Russia, Japan, China or
French Guiana or the U.S. facilities at Cape Canaveral, Fla., and
Vandenberg Air Force Base in southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Odyssey may be left at its launch site so it
does not have to return to Long Beach after each firing. Instead
the Sea Commander would carry rocket there. Time saved could allow
a dozen or more commercial launches a year, the same number that
now take place at Cape Canaveral, according to Sea Launch
executives.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Commander can also process two Zenits at a time, so
Odyssey could launch two rockets before the command ship has to
return to Long Beach for another.
</P>
<P>
   The first Sea Launch rocket will carry a dummy payload because
of concerns about past failures of the Zenit booster.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Launch Zenit 3SL is based on the two-stage Zenit 2 built
by the Ukrainians. The third stage is a modified Proton rocket by
Russian's Energia.
</P>
<P>
   The configuration has never been tested before.
</P>
<P>
   Zenit 2 rockets failed in 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1997. The last
resulted in the loss of 12 Globalstar communication satellites. Sea
Launch was to have launched a Galaxy XI satellite on its first
mission, but in the aftermath of of the last Zenit 2 explosion, it
was decided to use a dummy payload.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy satellite was transferred to a French Ariane rocket,
and Sea Launch subsequently lost two of three ICS launches from its
commercial manifest.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hughes and Loral have booked space on Sea Launch for future
launches, but the only certain commercial payload at present is the
third ICO satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Caceres said the success rate of the Zenit 2 is about 80
percent, though that drops to about 75 percent over the last half
dozen years. By comparison, Boeing's Delta 2, a mainstay of the
commercial and government launch business for many years, has a
success rate of about 97 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only one or two of Zenit 2s are launched a year, Caceres said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to launch more often than that to get a good track
record,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One problem Boeing would face if the Zenit 3SL failed is the
highly charged issue of technology transfer by U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the U.S. State Department suspended work on Sea
Launch over concerns that Boeing improperly shared sensitive
technology with its Sea Launch partners. Boeing paid a civil
penalty of $7.5 million and Sea Launch was allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue is apparently not over. A federal grand jury in
Seattle has been hearing information about the technology transfer
to determine if Boeing broke federal law.
</P>
<P>
   It was the failure of a Chinese Long March rocket carrying a
Hughes satellite that resulted in closer examination of technology
transfers involving U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   After the Chinese rocket exploded, a Hughes team shared
information about the cause with the Chinese. That caused an uproar
in Congress, which found that China was able to use the information
to improve its ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing would have to very careful in helping its partners
determine the cause of any the failure of the Zenit 3SL, and that
could delay the program by a year or more, Caceres said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a significant setback,'' he said.

HARLEM AFTER DARK IS COOKING AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 28)  
 (af)  
 By NINA SIEGAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Once, clusters of dapper night owls would zigzag down
the broad, limestone-lined avenues of Harlem, from jazz joint to
rent party to cabaret. In 1929, during the Harlem Renaissance,
Variety reported: ``When it comes to pep, pulchritude, punch and
presentation, the Harlem places have Broadway's nightclubs
distanced. Celebrities in all walks of life `make' the Harlem
joints every night. You'll likely see a Lady Mountbatten on the
ringside of the Cotton Club, a David Belasco at another and a
diplomat in the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who live in the 50 or so blocks above Central Park like to
term what's happening in the area today Harlem's Second
Renaissance, with the return of black professionals, new
businesses, increased tourism and a rebirth of night life. While
the term may be strained, it is not far from the truth. Economic
development, historical preservation and plummeting crime rates in
the area have contributed to a kind of boom.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Harlem's clubs, restaurants and bars now is like
watching a small bud begin to bloom. In a few years, said Berta
Alloway, a music promoter for some of the night spots, Harlem may
come to resemble its old self again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are moving back to Harlem, and they have
money, and they'd rather spend it here,'' she said. ``There's money
coming back up here, and people are coming back out to the clubs
also. They're coming from all over. A lot of Caucasian people are
coming back uptown, and they're not afraid to hang around. I look
around at night and say, `Didn't the tour bus leave?' and they say,
`We're not going anywhere.'''
</P>
<P>
   Al Howard, one of the two owners of Showmans, since 1942 a
staple of Harlem night life, which moved to a new address on 125th
Street in August, said that more than half of his clientele on any
given night are from out of town or from Manhattan below 110th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do get a lot of trade from downtown, a lot more than people
realize,'' he said. ``Once people come here, they see how safe it
is, they come back, and they tell their friends.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, there has been a 77 percent decrease in
homicides in the area surrounding the 28th Precinct in central
Harlem, according to the Police Department. (The citywide murder
rate has decreased 67 percent in the same period.)
</P>
<P>
   The Harlem scene today is part nostalgia, part novelty. Some of
the recognizable places, like the Apollo Theater, the Cotton Club
and even the famous Sylvia's Restaurant, maintain a steady tourist
trade but don't attract local residents in the same numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Other traditional joints, like Showmans, the Lenox Lounge,
Perk's Fine Cuisine and St. Nick's Pub, have found ways to maintain
their popularity through new events, like a gay night at the Lenox
Lounge; with theme evenings, like jazz, rhythm and blues and
calypso at Perk's every Thursday, or by sheer force of will.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, new clubs and cafes like the Sugar Shack, Miss
Mamie's Spoonbread Too, Emily's Restaurant and Bar, Londel's Supper
Club, Cafe Largo, the Gishen Cafe and the Audubon Bar and Grill,
are luring a different crowd, with tap dancing, open-mike poetry
nights, even comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's tremendous opportunity up here right now,'' said Marc
Calcano, who opened Cafe Largo on Broadway near 137th Street last
June and just began presenting live jazz on Sunday and Monday
nights. ``The volume of traffic here now is tremendous. Harlem was
vacant for a very long time, and it's about half filled now, and I
believe that in the next two to three years, tops, it's going to be
filled to capacity again.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everyone is convinced of the inevitability of
Harlem's comeback. A few years ago, Robert De Niro and his
restaurateur partner, Drew Nieporent, announced plans to reopen
Minton's Playhouse, a legendary jazz hall known as the birthplace
of bebop, by late 1997. But today, there is no Minton's. The
project has stalled, Nieporent said, because investors are wary of
signing on to this $3.1 million project.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Minton's, there is no lack of excitement at clubs
operating now. At 2:30 a.m. on a recent Monday, while the musicians
at St. Nick's Pub were gearing up for another set, Ms. Alloway,
dressed in leopard-skin eyeglass frames, a floppy black hat and a
leopard-skin velvet shirt, surveyed the boisterous and packed room,
where the cabaret tables were piled high with full ashtrays, empty
beer bottles and plates of oxtail stew. ``No one should have to
work on Tuesdays,'' she said, pitying those who had to get up in
the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Harlem's night life begins, like the workweek, on Monday. At
around 8 p.m., those with a taste for gumbo, banana pudding and
Diana Ross gather at Miss Mamie's Spoonbread Too, a restaurant
sprung from a well-known catering company. The decor is a cross
between the Southern kitchen and pop art, with a bold red and
yellow checkered floor and 1950s-style kitchen tables. In front of
the large windows, a pianist playing a small upright leads the
crowd in a sing-along or allows poets to share their craft.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, a more sophisticated crowd is settling in
at Wells Famous Home of Chicken and Waffles, where the 16-piece
Harlem Renaissance Swing Band packs into the main dining room. The
house specialty is fried chicken and waffles, once an after-hours
breakfast treat, now a main course on the evening menu. Dancers
from the New York Swing Society, led by Frank Manning, occupy the
front table and take the floor by turns.
</P>
<P>
   The long tables where everyone sits together are packed with
white and black groups, small clusters of tourists from Japan or
France, as well as an occasional celebrity just off a film shoot.
The dress code ranges from tube tops to floor-length furs, but
within an hour, when the food and drinks start flowing, everyone is
talking to everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The dancing picks up around 11:30, when the novice swing dancers
are lubricated enough to brave the floor next to the professionals
and old-timers. But by then, it's time to move on to St. Nick's Pub
on St. Nicholas Avenue and 149th Street, where you can still snag
an empty table before the jam session starts to bubble.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At St. Nick's, a narrow dive a few steps down from the street,
free jazz, accompanied at times by singers and occasional tap
dancers, begins at 11 p.m. and goes on until 3 a.m., and many
notable musicians _ Stevie Wonder, Etta Jones and James Carter
among them _ have been known to drop in for a round.
</P>
<P>
   ``The musicians that play downtown and play abroad, they don't
play our club for the money,'' said Ms. Alloway, who also goes by
the professional name Berta Indeed. ``But they come up because it's
like home. They'll come up and sit in with us.''
</P>
<P>
   By 3 a.m., part of the audience from St. Nick's or Wells has
arrived at the counter at M &AMP; G Diner, 383 West 125th Street, which
advertises itself in hot pink neon as ``Old Fashion' but Good.''
The R-and-B jukebox pumps out Billie Holiday or the Spinners, and a
pat of bright yellow butter shimmers in a plate of grits like the
rising sun.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Tuesday night, which is gay night at the Lenox
Lounge, beginning around midnight. ``You take a nap when you get
home, and you take another nap after you get home from work,'' one
patron, a Brooklynite, 36, explained. He was seated on the
crescent-shaped red leather couches that line the Art Deco bar.
</P>
<P>
   The Lenox Lounge has been a neighborhood mainstay since it was
opened at Harlem's hub, Lenox Avenue and 125th Street, in 1942. But
two years ago, a young promoter calling himself Cris Is Bliss put
together gay night, with live deejays spinning funk and hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   The steamy Zebra Room fills up by 12:30, and sleek black bodies
pack the dance floor until about 4. The lounge is the only club
open to the public that caters to gay men (Emily's has a ladies
night for women), although up to 15 years ago, Harlem had a handful
of gay clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since I've known about a place like this
in Harlem,'' said the Brooklynite, who did not want to be
identified, adding that as the quality of services improves in the
neighborhood, he expects to see more such places. ``There's better
policing, and there are more companies like Duane Reade up here,
and people feel more comfortable getting off the train and walking
around.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesdays, the Sugar Shack offers an open-mike poetry slam,
where performers in dreadlocks or with shaved heads recite verses
or read raplike meditations to drumbeats, keyboard and flutes.
Odell Holland Fincher, 27, who opened the club in January 1998,
hoped to create a blend of uptown and downtown that was ``spiritual
to a certain extent, but not overbearing,'' he said, adding, ``I
wanted it to be homey, so people could come and feel they were
sitting in their grandmother's living room.''
</P>
<P>
   The large, open, Southern-style kitchen, which prominently
displays boxes of Quaker Oatmeal, serves up candied yams, smothered
chicken and hearty soup. The rest of the club is clearly inspired
by a SoHo look, except for the kente cloth tacked on a couple of
walls.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the evening, the Audubon Bar and Grill, which opened in
1996, lures people uptown to a comedy night, with Angelo Lozada as
host. The roundup presents comedians who have performed on HBO,
Comedy Central and late-night television shows, including Greer
Barnes, Eric Nieves and Patrice O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   The large, brightly lighted club serves chicharones, yuca fries,
chicken wings and other bar food, as well as mixed drinks for $3,
but warns ``no hoodies, no hats and no sneakers,'' if you want to
get in.
</P>
<P>
   Thursdays might find a night owl at Perk's, a narrow bar joined
to an equally narrow white-table-cloth restaurant, where a jazz,
rhythm and blues and calypso band performs so close to the front
entrance that it is hard to get in or out. Thursday is also a good
night at Showmans, where tap dancers and jazz musicians perform for
an older crowd dressed in three-piece suits and fedoras.
</P>
<P>
   LeRoy Myels, a former tap dancer, who has spent evenings at
Showmans, on stage and off, since 1942, said he is pleased to see a
new generation venturing to Harlem clubs. In 1949, he said,
Showmans was the unofficial meeting place of the Copacetics tap
dance group. Today, it attracts dancers from the recently closed
long-running Broadway musical ``Bring In da Noise, Bring In da
Funk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids now are a little different, but the tap is still the
same,'' Myels said. ``The crowd has definitely increased since they
moved.''

   The weekend picks up, with live jazz and blues or deejays
spinning dance mixes at almost every spot, including St. Nick's,
Showmans, Perk's, the Lenox Lounge, Wells, the Cotton Club, the
elegant but spare Londel's Supper Club and a new Ethiopian

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The academic field of Russian studies, which has long played an
important role both in American university life and in
policy-making, is in an intellectual shambles and at risk of being
discredited.
</P>
<P>
   During the seven years since the Soviet Union ended, the field _
particularly political scientists and economists _ has embraced a
new guiding concept or paradigm that I call transitionology.
</P>
<P>
   Its basic premise is that since 1991, however bumpy the road,
Russia has been in a reform process of transition from Communism to
free-market capitalism and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Underpinning that premise have been two others. First, that the
only real reform policies for Russia's transition are the
neoliberal, shock-therapy, monetarist economic measures (and their
attendant politics) that have shaped the country under President
Boris Yeltsin. Second, that the transition, however costly and
painful, is good, progressive and necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners of transitionology claim that it is a great
advance over its predecessor, Sovietology. Because their work is
devoutly comparative, placing Russia's transition in the context of
similar transformations in other times and places, they say it
transcends the limits of mere area studies.
</P>
<P>
   And because it applies allegedly universalistic concepts and
theories taken from Western comparative social sciences to Russia,
they insist it is truly scientific.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, transitionology has failed in the most fundamental
empirical and analytical ways. The presumption that Russia must be
in transit to a Western-style, even American-like system _ a notion
that has also guided American policy, investment strategies,
foundation support and most American reporting about that country _
is merely a political, cultural conceit. Arrogant and
deterministic, it is an unseemly academic expression of America's
post-Cold War triumphalism.
</P>
<P>
   It has led Russian studies into an intellectual and perhaps
moral quagmire. By imposing Western concepts and assumptions on
Russia's very different realities, even the basic vocabulary of
scholarship has been debased. Things Russian have been given names
that are scarcely warranted or applicable _ for example, free
market, privatization, banks, middle class, free press,
constitutionalism, federalism, even capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Such mislabeling, almost Orwellian in its detachment from
reality, obscured the longest and most corrosive economic
depression of the 20th century, which has left some 70 percent of
Russians existing below or barely above the subsistence level. And
yet transition scholars have often insisted on calling this outcome
remarkable progress or a success story.
</P>
<P>
   Even the political implementation of Yeltsin's economic policies
after 1991 looks less like a transition than some kind of
regression. After all, this is not the first time a Russian
government, ideologically dogmatic and disdainful of gradualism,
has used shock methods to impose Western concepts, including
Marxism, on society with woeful human consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it the first time a Russian leader has ruled largely by
decree through a corrupt bureaucracy or been willing to destroy an
elected Parliament, as Yeltsin did in 1993. Here too, if it looks
like regression, why call it reform?
</P>
<P>
   If there has been no transition of the kind imagined in Russia
since 1991, what has been the main development? In my experience,
the words collapse, disintegration, catastrophe come most readily
to the minds of most Russians. But what more specifically?
</P>
<P>
   So great has been the nation's economic and thus social
catastrophe that we must now speak of an unprecedented development:
the demodernization of a 20th-century country. I do not mean only
the deindustrialization and colonial-like economic dependence so
often protested in the Russian opposition press but also a literal
and more general demodernization of the foundations of social life:
production, technology, transportation, finance, education and
more.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say that many highly educated Russian
professionals now must grow their own food to survive, millions of
other citizens lack adequate nutrition, medicine and fuel, and male
life expectancy has plunged to barely 58 years.
</P>
<P>
   Any economic achievements since 1991 seem to have been barely
more substantial than a Potemkin village and were all but vaporized
by the financial meltdown in August and September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As for political reform, it also seems likely that the
quasi-autocratic system imposed by Yeltsin in 1993, linked as it
was to his economic policies, will soon be dismantled,
substantially amended or transformed into full dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   For Russian studies, there is a profound irony in all this.
Theories and concepts of modernization have long occupied a large
place in the field. And for all its social science pretensions and
new jargon, transitionology is itself little more than a latter-day
version of those old approaches in Russian studies, now equating
modernization with an American-style economy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And yet, our transitionologists missed the most important
development in Russia since 1991, the exact reverse of the process
they professed to study, the country's progressive demodernization.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, who has been most on target? The advocates of the
transition who said that nuclear perils were steadily diminishing
or those of us who warned about the unprecedented catastrophe
unfolding in Russia? In the end, the result of transitionology has
been to create a Russian studies without Russia.
</P>
<P>
   To repair the damage done to the field, Russian studies must
change direction in fundamental ways. First and foremost, it has to
liberate itself from comparative political and economic theories
that know little or nothing about Russia and return to the kind of
close empirical research that underlies the best area studies.
</P>
<P>
   Without it, no purportedly universalistic concepts can be
assumed to fit the largest, most diverse and perhaps most
politically consequential country in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Russianists have to reopen large historical questions.
Why, for example, insist that the country's real transition from
Communism began only under Yeltsin, when the process was already so
far along in the Soviet system under President Mikhail Gorbachev?
</P>
<P>
   Although many scholars argue that the Soviet Union was incapable
of real change, as evidenced by its collapse, I think a strong case
can be made that by 1991 the system had turned out to be remarkably
reformable, certainly much more so than Western experts had
thought.
</P>
<P>
   And the Soviet system did not collapse but was abolished by
Yeltsin and his allies. If so, it may be that Gorbachev's
much-scorned gradualism and goal of a mixed economy, based on
combining marketization and privatization with whatever was viable
in the old state system, were (and may still be) the best way to
reform Russia and other Soviet republics _ that is, with more
durable results and at lesser costs.
</P>
<P>
   I am not optimistic that such questions will be reopened, even
though they are being raised anew in Russia today. But if they
aren't, there will be no change for the better in the field of
Russian studies, just as there has been no such transition in
Russia these past seven years.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, March 28, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SERBS-REVIEW (Belgrade) _ Slobodan Milosevic rose to
power on the issue of the minority Serbs in Kosovo, the province
from which Serbs derive their defining myths of nationalism,
victimization and endurance. Kosovo is the Serbs' Jerusalem, the
holy touchstone and center of their existence as a nation despite
all the defeats and travails of history. It is so deeply ingrained
in Serbian mythology that the West seems to have miscalculated
Milosevic's ability to abandon the issue even if he wanted to. By
Steven Erlanger. (`i' category).
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-KLA-REVIEW (Undated) _ In trying to bring the Serbs to
heel, NATO has unwittingly married itself to the Kosovo Liberation
Army, which is widely seen as a terrorist group. Although the KLA's
atrocities are dwarfed by those of Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic,
the fact that it has emerged to speak for Kosovo's Albanians, and
the fact that NATO is bombing Serb targets in Kosovo, reveals a
great deal about the moral ambiguities facing outsiders who wade
into the Balkans. By Chris Hedges. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   NY-POLICE-PROTESTS-REVIEW (New York) _ The protests and arrests
at police headquarters have gotten much media coverage. Less
attention has been given to off-stage huddles between the
protesters' lawyers and police officials, often to discuss ground
rules. The police politely explained that to get arrested for
disorderly conduct, the demonstrators would have to block BOTH
entrances. In turn, the demonstrators promised not to resist
arrest. Organizers have even provided police with the names of
those planning to be arrested _ a thoughtful act designed to
expedite warrant checks and the release of the conscientious
scofflaws. By Dan Barry. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-CONDUCT-REVIEW (Washington) _ If the candidates are to
be believed, the 2000 presidential campaign will be a high-toned,
polite affair. But while candidates sense that people are repulsed
by the vitriolic discourse in Washington _ and pollsters warn that
attacks can boomerang _ no one believes that the days of dirty,
dark politics are over. In this first post-impeachment campaign,
the trick will be to deploy attack strategies without seeming to do
so. By Richard L Berke.
</P>
<P>
   SLAVERY-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Slavery ended in the 1860s, but
it is only the 1990s that historians and others are writing freely
about the brutality and violence of slavery _ taboo topics that
have silenced families, black and white, for centuries. A
proliferating number of popular and scholarly books about slavery
are stripping away what is left of the velvety romance of benign
slaveholders presiding over docile slaves. And they are emphasizing
the slaves' efforts to escape or rebel. By Doreen Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   B52-REVIEW (Undated) _ The most remarkable aircraft taking part
in NATO's strikes at Serbia is also the oldest: the B-52.
Thirty-seven years after the last of them rolled off the production
line, the B-52 remains the workhorse of the Air Force, old and slow
but still able to deliver a terrific punch anywhere in the world.
And, incredibly, the last of the 76 B-52s still flying are not
expected to retire until 2044, when they will be 82 years old.
</P>
<P>
   CAR-THEFT-REVIEW (Detroit) _ The end of the Cold War has led to
an arms race between the people who make cars and the people who
steal them. It has changed the auto theft industry by opening up a
huge new market for stolen cars. Thieves supplying this business
have become more sophisticated; so have the counter-measures
designed by automakers to stop them. By Keith Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN'S-MAGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Changes in Glamour, echoed in
other women's magazines, is part of a larger retreat _ not a
backlash of men against women but of women against feminism _ that
vexes feminist theorists and cheers conservatives. By virtue of the
articles they choose to publish, youthful women's magazines like
Cosmopolitan and Glamour seem to argue that their reader doesn't
want or need feminism; that she doesn't care much about Washington
or affirmative action, and that she isn't angry about being cheated
out of day care. By Alex Kuczynski.
</P>
<P>
   PIZZA-CRISIS-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``When Washington is in crisis,
pizza sales soar,'' says Frank Meeks, owner of 59 Domino's Pizza
stores in the D.C. area. When the Lewinsky scandal broke, the White
House was ordering an unrivaled 900 pizzas a day. The Capitol set
its record _ 1,500 pies _ on Impeachment Saturday. As the bombing
of Serbia began, the Pentagon set its record: over 800 pies. By
Hubert Herring.
</P>
<P>
   SHAKESPEARE-HEADLINES-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ How have the media
been recycling the Bard-isms in the midst of Shakespeare's
pop-culture renaissance? Let us count the ways, with selected
newspaper headlines, starting with last week's Oscar awards, at
which `Shakespeare in Love' won Best Picture.
</P>
<P>
   ARCHITECT-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Stephen Kliment, former editor
of Architectural Record, says he often can't figure out what
today's architects and other high-concept designers are talking
about. In his book `Writing for Design Professionals,' he pleads
for clarity in proposals, letters, brochures and articles.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the Oscars and some other
highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   OPEC-WHY-REVIEW (Vienna) _ OPEC and its oil embargoes had
considerable impact in the 1970s because a measure of anti-American
sentiment could be counted on. But in the '80s and '90s, divisions
among the Mideast oil producers (and alliances with the U.S. after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait) became more important, even as new
non-OPEC oil production began in Alaska and the North Sea. Now a
new political factor has taken hold, uniting OPEC's members as
never before and overcoming much of their rivalries: the cost to
their countries of low oil prices. By Youssef Ibrahim.

A MESS IN RUSSIA: TWO VIEWS OF WHY
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: See the related stories RUSSIA-STUDIES and RUSSIA-POLICY.)
(nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Russian economy in disarray, people are trying to
figure out what went wrong. Indeed, Russia's reaction this week to
NATO's bombing of Serbia _ one hand raised in anger, the other out
appealing for Western aid _ underscores how this onetime
superpower's fortunes have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen F. Cohen, a professor of Russian studies at New York
University and the author of ``Rethinking the Soviet Experience''
(Oxford University Press), accuses Russia scholars of creating an
``intellectual shambles'' of their field. They have ignored the
country's unique history and contemporary economic conditions, he
argues, and insisted that free-market ``shock ther- apy'' is the
only way Russia could transform itself into a capitalist democra-
cy. Such policies have not produced successful reform but one of
the worst catastrophes in Russian history. These transition
scholars, he concludes, have created a ``Russian studies without
Russia.'' His essay is adapted from an article in the
January-to-March issue of Post-Soviet Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Malia, emeritus professor of history at the University of
Califor- nia at Berkeley, whose new book, ``Russia Under Western
Eyes: From the Bronze Horseman to the Lenin Mausoleum,'' will be
published by Harvard University Press in April, disagrees. He
responds that Russia had no choice but to dismantle the Communists'
command-style economy and try to replace it with a free market. He
says a gradual approach would not have been preferable. Mikhail S.
Gorbachev experimented with a kind of market socialism, he points
out, and it only made matters worse. While the transition to
capitalism has ended up being more difficult than Russian reformers
and Western analysts imagined, he faults not so much the analysts
as the disastrous mess left by the Soviet system. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At age 4, Aerin Lauder liked to play dress-up. In a
photograph from that period snapped at the Palm Beach, Fla., house
of her grandmother, the cosmetics empress Estee Lauder, Aerin wears
Mrs. Lauder's straw hat and gold sandals. One arm, saucily perched
on her hip, is sheathed to the elbow in a white satin glove.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't a trace of that self-consciously coquettish little
girl the other night, when Ms. Lauder swept into Christie's for a
cocktail party and preview of past Academy Awards fashions to be
auctioned for the benefit of AIDS research. In a room already
blazing with such legendary lights as Pauline Trigere and Lauren
Bacall, Ms. Lauder glowed, serene as a duchess as photographers
swarmed around her like ants on jam.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lauder, 28, is that rarest of Park Avenue princesses: a
hyperactive member of junior society by night, and by day, a
working woman who is being groomed for the executive suite of one
of the country's largest companies.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty, well-mannered and mannequin-tall, the third generation
Lauder is The Girl Most Invited. There she is photographed in Vogue
wearing Oscar de la Renta at a garden party; there, in Women's Wear
Daily, at a dinner at Chow to honor her friend, the designer
Michael Kors. The fashion press, in particular, seems intent on
anointing Ms. Lauder the Upper East Side equivalent of Hollywood
royalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society reporters are looking for a young star,'' said Kevin
West, a senior editor at W, who recorded the doings of the gilded
set in his former job on the magazine's Eye page. ``Which of us
isn't drawn to the glamor of taste, wealth and social prominence?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lauder is a fixture in a constellation of Young
Establishment stars, the daughters of moneyed and prominent New
Yorkers, many of whom know each other from private schools or
Locust Valley and have found careers in fashion and style fields.
They share uptown aspirations, presiding over high-profile
fund-raisers, and dressing in the hip and luxurious, but
understated, style of their favorite designers: Bill Blass, Michael
Kors, Marc Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   Among this pack are Serena Boardman, who works at Sotheby's, and
her sister Samantha, a medical student; Brooke de Ocampo, a former
Vogue editor; Eliza Reed, who works for her stepfather, Oscar de La
Renta, and of course, the ``Miller girls'' _ the sisters Pia Miller
Getty, Alexandra Von Furstenberg and Princess Marie-Chantal of
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Ms. Lauder, who is fronting for her family as she
ascends in junior society, mixing business with pleasure. She
accepts invitations to four or five functions a week, and will tell
you in a heartbeat that she loves to dress up, to go out ``and see
the dresses, see my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   All the intensive partying is part of a strenuous public
performance. ``Now that Mrs. Estee Lauder is getting older,''
Leonard A. Lauder, Aerin's uncle and the chairman and chief
executive of the Estee Lauder Companies, said, ``it's very
important that there be a Lauder who is socially active.'' Ms.
Lauder is the eyes and ears of the company. When she drops in at
glittering affairs, ``she helps us gain an understanding of a very
important segment of the market,'' Lauder said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lauder has been mentioned as a possible co-chairwoman of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute gala in December _ a
social pinnacle that has been occupied by Pat Buckley and
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, but never by a 20-something. The name
being linked with hers as co-chairman is Tommy Hilfiger. His
company would be the primary underwriter of the evening, which the
Met calls the party of the year. Because the Lauder companies are
the licensee for Hilfiger's Tommy fragrances, it would be a match
made in not only society columns, but also boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lauder, like her younger sister, Jane, 25, and her cousin
William, 38, is being groomed to take a leadership position in the
$3.4 billion Lauder cosmetics empire, which though publicly owned
is still very much a family operation. (Aerin and Jane's father,
Ronald S. Lauder, is chairman of Clinique Laboratories and Estee
Lauder International.)
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers have speculated that Ms. Lauder eventually
will head her own brand within the company _ a notion that Dan
Brestle, Ms. Lauder's boss and the president of Estee Lauder Inc.,
dismisses. But he does envision Ms. Lauder heading a company
division. ``Developing her career though the creative and marketing
side will give her the credibility to do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Ms. Lauder is director of creative product
development for the Lauder brand in the United States and Canada.
She creates the palette for lipsticks and other makeup, colors that
beckon at store counters with titillating names like Exotic, Nude
and Wild. In the last year, she has played an increasingly
influential role in the company's advertising campaigns, weighing
in on decisions from the choice of stylists and photographers to
the mood and ambiance of each image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hers is not a job on the outskirts of the company,'' said Alan
Mottus, publisher of The Informationist, a beauty trade monthly.
``She's a gladiator _ she's in the ring.''
</P>
<P>
   She certainly works with a gladiator's zeal. Within a day of
returning from a trend-spotting mission in Paris and Milan, she sat
in the Lauder conference room in the General Motors building on
Fifth Avenue, briefing her art and copy teams on the lacquered
eyes, bedroom hair and knee-high boots she had spied on Europe's
runways.
</P>
<P>
   The following day would send her speeding from a cluster of
in-house meetings to taping with the Arts and Entertainment
Network, which was filming a biography of her grandmother. The
former Josephine Esther Mentzer of Corona, Queens, founded her
empire on grit and a genius for spreading to the masses the gospel
of glamour-through-artifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loved beauty and she was incredibly feminine,'' said Ms.
Lauder, who has inherited not only Estee's taste for cut flowers,
good shoes and luxurious fragrance, but also an instinct for
divining trends.
</P>
<P>
   Not least of Ms. Lauder's activities that day would be a trip to
the obstetrician for a routine checkup. Ms. Lauder, whose husband,
Eric Zinterhofer, works for a private equity firm, is six months
pregnant, but never mind. She sprints between engagements on a pair
of spindly snakeskin heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to give up my jeans, but you won't get me out of my
Manolos,'' Ms. Lauder joked.
</P>
<P>
   She thinks nothing of mixing a demure lilac cardigan with racily
streamlined Prada pants, and she dreams of the days when she'll be
trim enough again to snake into Gucci's new lace-up-the sides
leather pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are women less confident who will dress in one designer
from head to toe,'' said Anna Wintour, Vogue's editor in chief,
whose party pages regularly feature Ms. Lauder and her Manhattan
set. ``But Aerin makes her own look. She never lets the clothes
wear her.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That unerring instinct also tells Ms. Lauder what shade of
mulberry lip stain her contemporaries will want to wear next fall _
an intuitive flair that sets her apart from her more cerebral
sister, Jane, marketing manager for the Clinique brand, and cousin
William, who is president of Clinique.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lauder's office looks like a fashion editor's lair. Guests
sit in pink imitation Eames chairs within yards of a bulletin board
paved with pictures and fabric swatches that conjure up winter
scenes. ``For fall we're seeing a cool neutral palette,'' she
pronounced, with an editor's penchant for spinning out forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   But in a business whose lead times are far longer than most
magazines, Ms. Lauder has to functions like a medium, channeling
style signals six months to a year before they appear on the
runways. ``I'm so ahead, it's scary,'' she joked.
</P>
<P>
   She draws her leads from a crazy quilt of sources _ travel
features, museum shows, yarn samples, jelly beans. Jelly beans? Why
not? Ms. Lauder learned from Dominque Szabo, the company's color
guru, that nothing is too lowly or farfetched to inspire next
season's hues.
</P>
<P>
   During the post-Milan briefing with the company's senior art
director, Jason Phillips, and a brace of copywriters, Ms. Lauder
issued directives with a blend of firmness and tact. Phillips
informed her that the marketing department planned to emphasize
lips and nails in the fall ads, but she wasn't having it. ``The
eyes were so important in Europe,'' she said. ``We have to focus on
that. We have six different mascaras. Now is a good time to push
them.''
</P>
<P>
   On the conference table, a poster-size photograph of Elizabeth
Hurley, the company's ``face,'' features the actress swathed in a
blanket and not much else. The image is a provocative departure
from traditional Lauder campaigns, which have tended to feature
models engaged in wholesome activities like fly-fishing. ``Aerin
has a cutting edge,'' Brestle, her boss, said. ``She's pushing the
envelope and positioning us in a place that historically we never
have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Her provocativeness is the result of an upbringing that took her
from Vienna, where her father was ambassador to Austria in the
mid-1980s, to a precocious adolescence in Manhattan. ``Since high
school I've been in leather and high boots,'' Ms. Lauder said. ``In
New York you grow up very fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The fashion and society columnist Billy Norwich described her
set as mingling traditional backgrounds with a liberal experience _
open classrooms and the like. ``We're not looking at a generation
of rebels,'' he said. ``These women aren't rejecting the parents'
values; they're interpreting them in their own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lauder shares her family's bred-in-the bone propriety almost
to a fault. ``I lose it when people are arrogant,'' she said. She
used to frequent Harry Cipriani, midtown headquarters for society
divas and fashion wags. But no longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there one day, and a woman was pregnant,'' she said.
``They had a table, but they ignored her. That's so obnoxious _ you
can quote me on that.''
</P>
<P>
   She returns phone calls, shows up for appointments on time and
guards her privacy. ``I would never let anyone photograph my
home,'' she said. She's also loath to have her husband interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep things separate,'' she said. ``I want him to have his
own thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwich said, ``Her set is loyal.'' So constant in fact, that
not one of her friends will utter an indiscreet word about her.
Intimates tend to describe her in terms of attributes she lacks:
unassuming, unpretentious, nonthreatening. Socially, she is as
well-defended as a fortress, a testament perhaps to the formidable
power of the Lauder name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aerin has no attitude,'' Ms. de Ocampo said.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Mr. Norwich observed, ``In Manhattan you can be a duchess
if you're courteous for just one day.''

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton sent Americans to their almanacs
for a crash course on the Balkans this week, but the lesson has
failed to convince a skeptical public that Kosovo is worth dying
for. After three days of U.S. and NATO air strikes against Serbian
forces, polls consistently show that Americans are confused about
the roots of the conflict, pessimistic about the chance of success
and deeply concerned about the possible loss of American lives. By

GOING TO WAR AS A WAY TO SAVE FACE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Whispers about a face-saving Serbian loss
to the world's most powerful military alliance began here long
before NATO bombs started to fall on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Reinforced earlier this week in interviews with well-placed
officials in the regime of President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia, with opposition leaders and with Serbs downing beers in
Belgrade bars, the whispers all follow a similar line of Balkan
logic. It goes like this:
</P>
<P>
   Surrendering control of Kosovo, a province that has genuine
historical and religious importance to 10 million Serbians, through
peaceful negotiation would be humiliating. It would break
Milosevic's hold on the hearts and minds of nationalists, leaving
him open to challenge and possible assassination at the hands of
well-armed warlords who are part of the ruling elite in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But a hard military loss of Kosovo, after a brave and hopeless
struggle against an overwhelming Western foe, could be just the
ticket that Milosevic needs to survive with his Serbian manhood and
his rule intact. It could rid him of a region where more than nine
out of 10 people are ethnic Albanians, an impoverished place that
political analysts in Yugoslavia agree is all but ungovernable.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, such a military defeat would sanctify
Milosevic in the lost-cause tradition of Serbia's famously martyred
Prince Lazar. Just before dying in Kosovo in 1389 during a
legendary failed charge against Ottoman invaders, the prince said,
``It is better to die in battle than to live in shame.''
</P>
<P>
   In this scenario, even as he savored the sweet fruit of a
glorious Serbian defeat, Milosevic would not have to share Prince
Lazar's unpleasant end. For unlike the prince, Milosevic wages
hopeless war from the safety of his bunkered residence in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, of course, has surfaced in official discourse in
Milosevic's Yugoslavia. With NATO bombs falling nightly, such
arguments, if breathed in public, would be treasonous. Officials
and state-controlled news organizations hold to the line voiced
this week by Vuk Draskovic, a deputy prime minister, who thundered
during a news conference: ``Losing Kosovo would be the death
penalty for the Serbian nation. Kosovo is the root of our national
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this noise, however, there was no shortage of thinking
Serbs willing to speak softly of Realpolitik.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Serbian leader who simply wrote off Kosovo would have a
terrible political problem,'' said Dejan Anastasijevic, who writes
about military affairs for Vreme, an independent Belgrade weekly.
``But it is sort of honorable to lose after a battle with the most
powerful military alliance in the world. I think Milosevic probably
is aware that in the long run, he cannot keep his control over
Kosovo, and he has opted for losing it by force.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar sentiments, although not for attribution, were voiced by
an official a few hours before the first bombs fell on Kosovo on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is lost, we keep the right to reconquer it, even 100
years from now,'' the official said. ``If we give it away, it is
lost forever.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   This view has been percolating for weeks in Belgrade. At
Wunderbar, a downtown watering hole, well-educated young people
cynically refer to a nation without Kosovo as the ``Fourth
Yugoslavia,'' conjured up by Milosevic as part of his decadelong
reign of fomenting ethnic war and losing real estate.
</P>
<P>
   The first three incarnations fell apart beginning in 1991 as his
nationalist policies brought about the breakup of the six republics
of the Serb-dominated Yugoslav federation, the loss of
Serb-majority territory during the Croatia war and, in the Bosnia
war, the loss of what many Serbs regarded as their land.
</P>
<P>
   In the political culture of Serbia, where defeat in pursuit of
nationalism ensures popular support, none of these losses crippled
Milosevic. He seems uniquely accomplished in the curious Balkan art
of losing wars and winning elections. Similarly, with the Serbian
leader now taking on the United States and much of the Western
world, a defeat in Kosovo has an almost delicious political upside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sometimes looks like America and Europe are doing all
things to support the survival of Milosevic,'' said a 31-year-old
rock musician drinking beer at Wunderbar. ``After the bombing and
the loss of Kosovo, he will be stronger.'' The musician said he did
not want his name published because he is trying to avoid mandatory
military service.
</P>
<P>
   Demographic and economic realities also play fundamental roles
in this argument.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of Voyislav Kostunica, president of the Democratic
Party of Serbia and a longtime political opponent of Milosevic,
``This is a place that even under the best of conditions is very
difficult to govern by Serbs, or for the matter by the Albanians
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, a farming region of about 2 million people at the
southern tip of Serbia, is by far the poorest and least developed
part of Yugoslavia. Before the breakup of the six republics, it had
the federation's highest infant mortality rate, highest illiteracy
rate and, ominously for Serbs, highest birth rate.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians were the third-largest group in what used to be
Yugoslavia, after the Serbs and the Croats. If their birth rate
continued at current levels, demographers say, they could surpass
the Serbs in population in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago, ethnic Albanians became the overwhelming majority
in Kosovo itself. Their numbers and their clannish social mores
made Kosovo an uncomfortable place for Serbs, who deserted the
region in droves. The Albanians have resisted a number of
Milosevic's schemes to repopulate the region with Serbs. Many
Belgrade Serbs say that they never travel to Kosovo and that their
only interest in the place is in preserving its medieval Orthodox
monasteries.
</P>
<P>
   While all this may be news to Americans trying to figure out
what the bombing is all about, it has long figured into the
calculations both of Serbian leaders in Belgrade and Kosovo
politicians. Seven years ago Venton Suroi, a political leader in
Kosovo, said confidently that ethnic Albanian autonomy ``was only a
matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bloody separatist struggle that has been under way in
Kosovo for the last year, analysts here say, was not inevitable. As
was the case in both Croatia and Bosnia, violence was ignited by
Milosevic's maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic burned his bridges with the Albanians in 1989 when
he ended the autonomy they were given by Tito in 1974,'' said
Anastasijevic, the Vreme writer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, when Milosevic was president of the republic of Serbia,
he played his first nationalist card in Kosovo, stripping ethnic
Albanians of political rights and tapping into long-simmering rage
among hard-line Serbs who resented the Albanians' political power
in Tito's Yugoslavia. Propelled by nationalist rage, Milosevic
elbowed aside his Communist superiors in Belgrade and skyrocketed
to power in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   There have been repeated opportunities in the last decade for a
peaceful endgame in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had several chances to correct his policies during the past
10 years,'' said Anastasijevic. ``The main Kosovo leaders for most
of that time were pacifists. He probably could have made a deal
with them that would have kept an autonomous Kosovo in Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Those pacifists, however, lost popular power last year to
leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army, whose members were fed up
with go-slow policies that bought little but Serbian repression.
Those leaders won widespread support among Albanians by vowing to
fight for independence.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, violence has fired up Serbian nationalist sentiment,
especially among Serbs who would not normally care about Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Anastasijevic said the noble loss of Kosovo in an unwinnable war
against the West would keep those sentiments alive, at least in the
short term. In the process, he added, Milosevic will be able to
distract Serbs from the many other costs of being a pariah state in
Europe.

   WASHINGTON _ Iceland has no military. Luxembourg has no air
force. Greece doesn't want to bomb a neighbor. And the three other
nations not contributing forces to the NATO air war against Serbia
have only been alliance members for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But those six countries, including the new members _ Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic _ bridle at the suggestion that they
are not full partners in the allied attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Greece is doing,'' said Alexander Philon, the Greek
ambassador to the United States, ``and what we decided a long time
ago to do with the full agreement of NATO, is to open all of our
ports, roads and airfields to the mission but not get involved
directly in the actual bombing of our neighbor. We are going to
live in the future with those countries, and we don't want
resentments.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without an air force, Luxembourg has contributed by giving
money to the Belgian Air Force and registering the only planes
common to all NATO members, the AWACS reconnaissance planes, under
the Luxembourg flag. ``We wanted to make the point of our
solidarity with the mission,'' said Carlo J. Krieger, deputy chief
of the Luxembourg Embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airspace _ we're providing airspace,'' said Andreas Simonyi,
the Hungarian Ambassador to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hungarian parliament also voted to provide airfields and
bases as well as airspace should NATO countries need them in their
attack on Hungary's southern neighbor. ``That is a very very strong
statement on our behalf, taking into account we are a neighboring
country,'' Simonyi said.
</P>
<P>
   Poland, once one of the major military powers in the Eastern
bloc, went further and offered combat troops should the operation
require them, said Jaroslaw Kurek, the press officer at the Polish
Embassy. ``We have no active combat role now but we are ready to
take part in any ground operation if that is necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he added, a Polish military brigade is guarding
the American who directs the Kosovo Verification Mission, the
unarmed group of monitors who had tried to keep warring Serbs and
ethnic Albanians apart.
</P>
<P>
   The decision for Iceland was simple. ``We have no military, so
we are not involved,'' said Jon Hannibalsson, the ambassador in
Washington. But Iceland has provided a naval base to NATO since
1951.

<P>
   No one would dispute that Russia is in dire straits. The economy
is prostrate, Boris Yeltsin's reign is ending, and the population
feels that Russia's market democracy has largely failed. True,
freedom of expression and association are now so widely accepted
that all contenders for the succession know they can come to power
only legally. Still, the predominant note among Russia watchers is
gloom, often accompanied by recriminations about who is responsible
for the country's plight.
</P>
<P>
   Just as debate about Russia under communism was always
passionate, so discussion of its post-communist transition to
democracy and the market has proved chronically contentious as
optimists and pessimists squared off over the results. To the
optimists, Yeltsin's Young Turks, Yegor Gaidar and Anatoly Chubais,
despite mistakes and setbacks, were basically winning the battle of
reform. The prime exhibit of their success was 80 percent
privatization and a stable ruble by 1996. To the pessimists, these
very policies were in fact ruining Russia _ a conviction often
inspired by chagrin that Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika brought
not the Soviet system's rejuvenation but its precipitate collapse.
And after Yeltsin's re-election in 1996 with the aid of an
oligarchy of tycoons, it became increasingly easy to make the case
for doom.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Cohen is surely the gloomiest of the doomsayers,
although such Russia specialists as Peter Reddaway at George
Washington University and even Susan Eisenhower run him a close
second. The burden of the radical pessimist complaint is, first,
that Yeltsin's false democrats, aided and abetted by the U.S.
government and the International Monetary Fund, have foisted on
Russia an alien free market policy that is destroying the country.
Second, Western social science legitimizes this policy with the
arrogant thesis that the entire world is destined for
modernization, American style. Third, there exists some special
Russian way to modernity that was tragically missed in 1991, though
we are told nothing about that way except that it is gradual. In
short, Western-inspired policies are to blame for Russia's plight.
</P>
<P>
   But it is no accident that Soviet communism collapsed into a
defective capitalism. The old system's lumbering command economy
was no longer competitive internationally, and its party-state was
a despotism that stifled all innovation. Gorbachev's halfhearted
reforms _ that eternal will-o'-the wisp, market socialism _ simply
brought matters to overt crisis. Out of fear of Communist
conservatives, he first dismantled the party's central apparat and
based himself instead on an elected Soviet of People's Deputies,
thereby sabotaging his ability to control events. Next, he gutted
the plan before creating market institutions, thereby adding
economic crisis to administrative chaos. A gradual transition to
anything therefore became impossible.
</P>
<P>
   So the nomenklatura, seeing that the Soviet game was up, moved
to privatize Russia's industrial rubble for its own benefit, and
the parties of the national republics privatized their territories
right out of the union. It is this general collapse that permitted
a minority of intelligentsia democrats, neo-classical economists
and Yeltsin's small counterapparat to come to power. And since the
only alternative to plan and party was the market and democracy,
they took that route, of course with Western advice and financial
aid. This choice was not imposed by the West, however. It was
thrown up by circumstances and ardently espoused by Yeltsin's
reformers. For the alternative was the continuing stagnation and
despotism now observable in other former Soviet republics, most
strikingly Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   The first name for the new policy was shock therapy. Its
advocates knew it would be painful and its benefits deferred. But
they also knew it was intrinsically feasible, for it had been
pioneered after 1991 in Poland with notable success. In Russia,
however, the positive results were limited, and these were largely
annulled by the crash of 1998. There are many reasons for these
differing results, but the principal one is that communism lasted
much longer and cut much deeper in Russia than in Central Europe.
It is this heavy Soviet heritage, not the mistakes of the last
decade, real though those are, that is the major source of the
present impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Let us not forget how simple and crude that Soviet communism
was: a military-industrial complex, based on a long obsolete plant
of heavy industry constituting some 70 to 80 percent of the
economy. And though now significantly demilitarized, this plant is
still there. The problem is that it produces little value, that is,
goods salable on the free market. Yet closing down this mastodon
and dismissing its workers would be tantamount to closing down the
country, which is of course impossible. So the system keeps going
through the motions of being an economy, with its various
components purchasing materials and acquitting both debts and taxes
through barter, and paying wages with goods that are valueless
except for further barter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This surreal system has been called a virtual or fictitious
economy. All the same, it keeps people nominally employed; it even
keeps them fed, clothed and housed. So the country is remarkably
quiet for a society in such profound crisis, which is why the
reformers never dared touch it. Instead, they made the bet that by
turning it over at fire sale prices to the nomenklatura (who
controlled it anyway) or to the infamous oligarchy, eventually the
logic of the market would force obsolete industries to shape up. In
fact, the reformers had little choice; for who would buy these
worthless, rusting ruins? Nor will most of them ever be
successfully reconverted. They will have to be broken up for scrap
while a modern plant is slowly created alongside. And this is the
task not of one decade but of many.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is also a real economy, producing goods salable
around the world for hard currency. This economy deals mostly in
raw materials _ oil, gas, minerals _ and so yields little for the
mass of the population. Moreover, the struggle for control of these
valuable resources has been ferocious, and thus a major source of
Russia's staggering corruption.
</P>
<P>
   So now that we know who is to blame, what is to be done? The
only honest answer is that no one at the moment has a clue. And for
good reason. In the matter of reforming _ that is, dismantling _ a
Soviet-type command economy and its party-state, multiple
alternatives simply do not exist. In fact, there is only one
possible policy: to marketize and privatize, though the pace and
mode of the transition will vary from case to case.
</P>
<P>
   Thus a baffling conclusion becomes unavoidable: The only
possible policy for an exit from communism has been tried, and it
didn't work, or at least didn't work in the way anticipated.
De-communizing a country as hobbled as Russia has turned out to be
a far more intractable process than either Russian reformers or
Western analysts ever imagined.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, given the abject bankruptcy of Sovietism, at a
minimum it is clear that someday, in some form, Russia will have to
resume active marketization and privatization. For who wants to go
back to the future in Belarus? Indeed, Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and even the Russian Communist Party (as they wait for the
next installment of IMF credits) have no alternative policy in
mind.

BEST FRIENDS IZZO AND MARIUCCI MAKE IRON MOUNTAIN PROUD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LOWELL COHN   
 The (Santa Rosa, Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As you may know by now, Steve Mariucci, coach of the San
Francisco 49ers, and Tom Izzo, coach of Final Four entry Michigan
State, grew up together in Iron Mountain, Mich. They were boyhood
friends, although they attended different grammar schools as little
kids. Izzo went to a public school called Central, Mariucci
attended Immaculate Conception. They rode the same school bus,
which Mariucci named the Immaculate Contraption.
</P>
<P>
   When they were teenagers, they both attended Iron Mountain High
School. They were co-captains of the basketball and football teams
as seniors. Mariucci was the quarterback, Izzo the running back.
Izzo was the point guard, Mariucci the shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   They also competed together in the mile relay. ``I always handed
the baton to him with a big lead and he'd usually lose it,''
Mariucci said the other day on a conference call he'd arranged to
talk about his pal.
</P>
<P>
   But the scene about the wall beats everything. In their senior
year at Iron Mountain High, Mariucci and Izzo decided to do
something about the 10-foot-high reinforced concrete wall that runs
around the football stadium. A definite eyesore, it looked like the
leaden gray walls that encircle a penitentiary. They dedicated
their entire summer to painting it on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   There they'd be working, and Izzo's dad, Carl (always called
Carlie), would drive by several times a day to bring the boys Cokes
and to chat. That's how proud he was of them. They painted the wall
black and gold, Iron Mountain High's colors, and when they were
done, they climbed on top of the bleachers and stenciled upon a
20-foot-high background, HOME OF THE MOUNTAINEERS.
</P>
<P>
   That story is such a bit of Americana _ two innocent, devoted,
dedicated boys doing something for their town, population 8,500. It
smacks of malt shops and scuffed Keds and Norman Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the story doesn't end there. Mariucci and Izzo went
off to college together, to Northern Michigan to be precise.
Naturally, they roomed together all four years. According to
Mariucci's dad Ray, Izzo became ``part of the family.'' After that,
when they were young coaches, they shared a house together. That
makes seven years in a row they were roommates. Hey, not even
Koufax and Drysdale were that close.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Ray Mariucci would want to know what was going on with
his son, but he could never ask Steve, because his kid would say
everything was swell no matter what. So Ray went to Tom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would confide in Tom to see how Steve felt and to get an
in-depth answer,'' Ray told me the other day. ``He was gracious
enough to tell me the truth. I admired Tom for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci and Izzo were best men at the other guy's wedding.
Except one time there was a bit of a hitch. Just before Mariucci
got married, Izzo shattered his jaw in a softball game. So he flew
to Mariucci's wedding with his mouth wired, and when it came time
to deliver the toast, he sort of mumbled, and frankly, no one could
hear a word he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Iron Mountain that story has become part of the Iz/Mooch
lore. Also part of the lore is this year's NCAA Tournament.
Mariucci flew to St. Louis to watch Izzo's team beat Oklahoma in
the Midwest Regionals. At the game, he held the hand of Izzo's
wife, Lupe. ``She was really nervous,'' Mariucci said. ``Maybe she
was holding my hand. I was really nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Mariucci watched film of Kentucky with Izzo and his
assistants until three in the morning. ``I kept telling them to
blitz and they kept telling me to shut up,'' Mariucci said. He
returned to the Bay Area early the next morning for 49er meetings,
but watched Michigan State beat Kentucky on television. He booked a
redeye to the Final Four Friday night in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   On the conference call, Mariucci tried to define his friendship
with Izzo. ``We went through everything together,'' he said.
``Everything as a kid, adolescent, young adult and marriage. We
know each other's secrets. He's as honest a person as you're ever
going to find. I sound like I have a biased opinion of my best
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   That's OK, Steve. It's allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci also gave his impression of Izzo as a coach: ``He's got
a football coaching demeanor. He could very well coach football at
any level. If you go by the old cliche that a team takes on the
personality of its coach, you'll see that in his kids. They're a
very physical team. They play fast and they play hard, and they're
diving for balls, knocking guys out, getting concussions. It's like
Big Ten football.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Izzo and Mariucci are still painting the wall. Last
year, they inaugurated the Izzo-Mariucci Golf Classic to raise
money for sports facilities at Iron Mountain High. They've already
put together $75,000 for new bleachers. They're also funding a new
sports complex at Northern Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, they happened to be in town visiting their
families at the same time. The local newspaper ran a photo of them
together, accompanied by an article. What was the theme of the
article? They're here. Period. In Iron Mountain the hereness of
Izzo and Mariucci was big news.
</P>
<P>
   So you get the picture. The two pals are famous now, but they
haven't outgrown the town or each other.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's rage over NATO airstrikes in Yugoslavia boiled
over Friday night when it canceled the upcoming visit by Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The former White House intern had been scheduled to visit Russia
in June or July to promote a Russian-language version of her book,
``Monica's Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, however, the Russian publisher announced that the
trip was being canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can hardly imagine that millions of Russian citizens would
give Ms. Lewinsky a proper welcome under the circumstances,'' a
representative of the Russian publishing company told the news
agency Interfax. ``The visit would come at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky has figured before in the Russian reaction to
NATO's attack. The newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets charged that the
end of her affair with President Clinton has left the American
leader so frustrated and despondent that he has resorted to
military action.
</P>
<P>
   As Russian protesters rallied at the American Embassy this week,
one women carried an English-language sign: ``President Clinton,
Make Love, Not War.''

NEW ASTHMA DRUG GETS OK FROM FDA, COMPANY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sepracor Inc., a biotechnology company based in Marlborough,
Mass., said Friday that it had received approval from the Food and
Drug Administration to begin marketing a new inhalable drug named
Xopenex for the treatment of asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Sepracor shares fell $6.6875 to $111.5625 Friday in Nasdaq
trading. Analysts said the approval was anticipated, and that
Sepracor shares were subject to profit-taking after rocketing from
$36.25 to $140.87 in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   With Friday's approval coming after the company's $90 million
agreement to produce an improved version of Prozac for Eli Lilly &AMP;
Co. in December, the value of Sepracor's strategy is clear, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   The generic name for Xopenex is levalbuterol, which the company
says is an improved version of albuterol, the world's leading
asthma treatment, which works by dilating the bronchial tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Albuterol, sold under the trade name Ventolin by Glaxo Wellcome,
and in various generics, will remain on the market as well. It had
estimated worldwide sales of $1.2 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a validation that the FDA can give marketing approval to
an improved chemical version when the original drug remains on the
market,'' said Sergio Traversa, an analyst with Mehta Partners. He
forecast Xopenex sales of about $25 million in its first year,
peaking at $150 million. ``It will never be a blockbuster for
Sepracor, but it's a validation of their strategy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first approved usage for Xopenex will be for the relief and
prevention of bronchial spasms. The drug will be available in a
solution to be used in a machine called a nebulizer. This is an
electric air compressor with a mouthpiece through which a patient
inhales vaporized asthma medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the prevalence of asthma, especially in children, on the
rise, there is a great need for rescue therapy with minimal side
effects,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Drazen, a professor at Harvard Medical
School. ``Levalbuterol is the first real advance in rescue asthma
therapy in over 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Sepracor has indicated that it will price Xopenex comparably to
Glaxo's Ventolin, which sells for about $1.75 a dose; the generics
typically sell for $1.25 a dose. However, patients are expected to
use just three doses of Xopenex a day, compared with four for the
older drug, Traversa said.
</P>
<P>
   Sepracor, founded in 1984, developed a technology to exploit the
century-old discovery that most chemicals are formed in
mirror-image pairs. For most drugs, only one side of the pair,
called an isomer, is active, while the reverse-image side may cause
side effects.
</P>
<P>
   By isolating the active isomer of albuterol, and eliminating the
inactive mirror-image isomer, Sepracor claims to have produced a
more effective drug, with fewer side effects. Sepracor patented the
isomeric forms of many major drugs before their manufacturers
devised ways to copy its technology.

STATESMANLIKE SCHROEDER PULLS HARMONY FROM EUROPE'S HAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Showing a statesmanship that had seemed to elude him,
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder guided the European Union early Friday
to a landmark agreement to hold down its spending enough to enable
three Central European countries to join.
</P>
<P>
   The union also advocated Palestinian statehood within the next
year in more forthright terms than it had previously used or than
the United States has ever backed, provoking a furious reaction
from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Through a long night, and despite the overwhelming distraction
of Kosovo, Schroeder cajoled leaders of the 15-member bloc to agree
to the so-called Agenda 2000 reforms, which will cap the group's
budget at $92 billion a year through 2006.
</P>
<P>
   By then Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary should already be
members. Strong growth in the budget could have made membership
difficult for the three formerly Communist countries to afford.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, long the unstable center of a volatile continent, has a
deep commitment to surrounding itself with allies that are in both
NATO and the European Union. Schroeder, whose first six months in
office have been stormy and who has sometimes given an appearance
of frivolity, Friday made himself the voice of this vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not win the lottery by gaining any reduction in German
payments,'' said Schroeder, who presided over the meeting. ``But in
order to make compromises, we had to take into consideration all
countries. What has come out of our negotiations is an agenda that
reflects a truly unified Europe, and therefore the meeting was a
success.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first months in office, Schroeder vigorously demanded
that Germany's net annual contribution of about $12 billion be cut,
saying his country was paying most for European ``waste.'' The
statement recalled some of Margaret Thatcher's in the 1980s and
suggested to some that Germany's commitment to the consolidation
and extension of the European Union was waning.
</P>
<P>
   But reversing course Friday, Schroeder accepted a reform package
that will provide his country no financial relief. His decision
seems to be a political gamble in which the populist attraction in
Germany of a refund was outweighed by his need to demonstrate that
a serious leader sits at the summit of Europe's most powerful
country.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, reached after a final negotiating session that
lasted more than 20 hours and often seemed on the brink of
collapse, is aimed at holding farm subsidies at their current level
of $44.5 billion a year from 2000 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The Union's agricultural policy, intended to protect farmers
from lower world prices, is notoriously costly and backed with a
notorious vigor by the million French farmers who receive about 22
percent of total farm spending.
</P>
<P>
   French resistance to any cuts was therefore strong, and
Schroeder had several difficult discussions with President Jacques
Chirac of France, officials said. Italy and Spain, two other
principal beneficiaries of the farm policy, also fought hard to
resist changes.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is to keep its annual rebate of about $3.2 billion,
representing about 60 percent of the difference between what it
pays into the European budget and what it receives, despite
vigorous protests by several countries.
</P>
<P>
   While discussion on the budget took up most of the time, Kosovo
inevitably weighed heavily, and the Middle East was also discussed.
</P>
<P>
   With four neutral countries in its midst, the union stopped
short of explicit backing for the NATO airstrikes but said it was
up to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia ``to stop the
military action by immediately stopping his aggression in Kosovo
and by accepting the Rambouillet accords.'' The accords call for
self-government for the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo, with the
prospect of independence after three years.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on the Middle East, the European leaders
supported ``the continuing and unqualified Palestinian right to
self-determination, including the option of a state'' and said they
looked forward to the ``early fulfillment of this right.''
</P>
<P>
   They said those rights, to be achieved through negotiation, were
``not subject to any veto.''
</P>
<P>
   The wording was a stronger expression of support for a
Palestinian state and a stronger rejection of any Israeli right to
veto it than the Europeans have formally made before.
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders said Israel and the Palestinians should extend
the current ``transitional period'' leading to statehood beyond May
4, adding, ``It should be possible to conclude the negotiations
within a target period of one year.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the European position went beyond publicly stated
American views, some officials suggested that it had been
coordinated with Washington to encourage the Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to remain patient on May 4, the date on which he has
indicated he may unilaterally declare statehood.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was adopted despite an extraordinarily vehement
denunciation of European leaders by Netanyahu before the conference
ended. He was apparently reacting to a draft of the final
statement, a draft that proved accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is especially saddening that Europe of all places, where
one-third of the Jewish people perished, sees it as correct to try
to force a dangerous solution upon Israel that jeopardizes its
interests,'' the prime minister said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The summit meeting ended at dawn Friday.

FIRE KILLS AT LEAST 35 IN ALPS TUNNEL LINKING FRANCE AND ITALY

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ French and Italian officials said Friday that at least
35 people had died in a fire that erupted Wednesday deep inside the
Mont Blanc tunnel in the Alps. The blaze, which began in a heavy
truck and quickly engulfed some 30 other vehicles, was finally
brought under control Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Details about the casualties were slow to emerge because
firefighters from France, Italy and Switzerland were prevented by
searing heat and toxic smoke from reaching the scene of the
disaster, almost exactly halfway through the seven-mile tunnel. One
firefighter died of a heart attack and some 27 others were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials said that at one point the temperature in the
tunnel reached 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. With the motors of fire
trucks stalling for lack of oxygen, the firefighters, wearing masks
and carrying oxygen tanks, were forced to continue on foot. One
fire official, Jean-Guy Laurent, said many victims were found at
the wheels of their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the Mont Blanc Tunnel and Autoroute, made up of
the French and Italian agencies that operate the tunnel, said
Friday that ``despite extreme difficulties in counting the victims,
the toll of about 30, which was indicated previously, should
unfortunately be reached.'' Later reports said the death toll could
reach 40.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 24 charred bodies have been found, although only nine
have been identified. The names of many of those feared dead have
been provided by anxious relatives and truck companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire is out and we have now examined all the tunnel,''
Ruggiero Borgia, managing director of the Italian Mont Blanc tunnel
agency, said Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot said the tunnel, Europe's
longest when it was inaugurated by President Charles de Gaulle in
1965, will be closed for several weeks because some of its concrete
casing and rock surface had collapsed. The two-way single-lane
tunnel, which connects France and Italy, is used by as many as
5,000 vehicles daily and has never before suffered a fatal
accident.
</P>
<P>
   The fire began at around 11 a.m. Wednesday on a
Belgian-registered truck carrying 20 tons of flour and margarine.
According to some accounts, several other large tractor-trailer
trucks ran into the first truck and soon caught fire. The tunnel
agency said eight trucks driving toward France as well as 12 trucks
and 10 or 11 cars heading for Italy were trapped over a 1,000-foot
stretch of the tunnel. Gilbert Degrave, the driver of the truck
where the blaze began, was able to escape along with at least four
other drivers.
</P>
<P>
   A Belgian newspaper quoted Degrave as saying that he looked in
his rear-view mirror and saw smoke rising from the back of his
truck where, he believed, fuel had leaked onto the exhaust pipe.
``Everything was ablaze in half a minute,'' he told the newspaper,
Het Laatste Nieuws. ``I ran for my life. Behind me, all hell broke
loose. In a few minutes, the tunnel was like an oven.''
</P>
<P>
   France's Transport Ministry has ordered a full inquiry into the
accident, but already complaints are being heard that the tunnel's
ventilation system was inadequate and obsolete. Philippe Sardin,
director of the Tunnel Research Center in Paris, said the tunnel
was built with 1950s technology that had never been modernized even
though new ventilation and fire prevention techniques now exist and
were installed in the Channel tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Charlet, the mayor of Chamonix, the ski resort town in
Haute-Savoie at the French end of the tunnel, Friday called for
heavy trucks to be banned from using the tunnel. ``For years, we
have been telling the central authorities that this high mountain
valley cannot handle 800,000 trucks per year,'' he said, adding
that France should follow Switzerland's example of switching cargo
transportation from highways to railroads.

PRECOCIOUS ACTRESS IN A `MOD' MODE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use  Sunday, March 28  by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES _ Claire Danes has always seemed wise beyond her years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the unusually self-aware high schooler she played on the
ahead-of-its-time TV dramedy ``My So-Called Life'' to the smart,
sensitive teens she's created in such films as ``Home for the
Holidays,'' ``Little Women,'' ``Romeo + Juliet'' and ``To Gillian
on Her 37th Birthday,'' Danes has specialized in girls who act
markedly more mature than most of the adults around them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just shy of her 20th birthday, Danes is doing one of pop
culture's key kids in a grown-up world. She's Julie Barnes in the
big-screen version of ``The Mod Squad,'' that shaggy '60s TV show
in which three young hippie types worked for the Establishment as
undercover cops.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which is set on the fringes of contemporary L.A. club
culture, stars Danes in the old Peggy Lipton role as a recovering
addict, Giovanni Ribisi (``Saving Private Ryan'') as messed-up rich
kid Pete Cochrane and Omar Epps (``Scream 2,'' ``Higher Learning'')
as cool-but-smoldering Lincoln Hayes. All three characters have
traded potential jail sentences for badges (but not guns).
</P>
<P>
   The movie is the latest in a long line of '60s TV retreads, and
it opened Friday to witheringly negative reviews. But the
perceptive and articulate Danes has good reasons for taking on what
she saw as another in a hoped-for continuing series of new
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the most dramatic turn I've taken,'' admits the
waifish blonde, a New Yorker who, at the tender age of 10, began
studying at the prestigious Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute. ``But
it was a really good time. And I think it's important to tackle
different genres and explore the boundaries of film.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it was so much a product of its Generation Gap era, many
have deemed ``Mod Squad'' impossible to update. But Danes believes
that director Scott Silver found a way to make it resonate for
today's youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really focused on the alienation of the characters, which
the TV show only briefly touched on,'' she notes. ``I think that's
extremely relevant to our society today. People feel very
disconnected from each other and are seeking a community that they
can feel a part of. These characters find that in the Squad.''
</P>
<P>
   According to director Silver, Danes' very participation was key
to creating the ``Mod Squad'' film community.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Claire comes aboard, it becomes a different movie,'' he
says. ``She's such a classy actress, and other actors really want
to work with her. And she's an incredibly gifted actor, incredibly
honest, open and natural. She's such an accomplished and mature
actress ... And she's been doing this a lot longer than I have,
which was intimidating in some sense. But she was great to work
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-star Ribisi echoes those sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so beautiful, intelligent and precocious _ I just hate
her!'' Ribisi jokes. ``No, it was really a pleasure and an
opportunity to work with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone has nice things to say about Danes, the one
glaring exception being the Philippine government. After a grueling
experience filming the still-unreleased prison drama ``Brokedown
Palace'' there, Danes complained to the media about conditions in
the island nation. She was subsequently declared persona non grata
by the Manila City Council, which also banned showings of her films
in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go there,'' Danes replies when asked about the
controversy. ``It's so grim, that whole thing. I don't want to talk
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   While that sounds like a typical Hollywood dodge, it's atypical
of Danes. She tries very hard to avoid the usual movie star airs
and actorly pretensions. Indeed, her biggest fear is becoming
cocooned in show-biz hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most destructive part of being an actress in this business
is that you're constantly shielded from spontaneity and real-life
experiences,'' she observes. ``You have a really strong team
(agents, managers, publicists, etc.) that serves as a pretty
impenetrable fortress, and I think that's unfair to a person. It's
really easy to become quite stagnant in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Danes' solution?
</P>
<P>
   ``I ditch 'em!'' she cracks. ``I live in New York, I go to
school, I have a network of friends who are entirely unrelated to
the business. The majority of my friendships are with people like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   She makes one major exception to that rule, however. Danes
shares her New York apartment with Australian singer-songwriter Ben
Lee. The couple has been together for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so in love it's disgusting,'' she jokes. ``My boyfriend's
just a sweetheart. He's really funny, he's really smart, and he
loves me really, really well. That's a quality that people take for
granted; I mean, it's a skill, and not everybody's capable of doing
it. I think that's the most critical quality.''
</P>
<P>
   How old is this girl? Under 30, maybe. But under 20?
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Danes is a freshman at Yale, the alma mater of
her friend and mentor Jodie Foster (plans are in motion for Danes
to star in Foster's next directing effort, the circus story ``Flora
Plum''). When attending classes, she lives in a campus dorm with a
roommate. It's all part of her ongoing effort to lead as normal a
life as she can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I function on campus pretty well,'' she reports. ``People who
meet me are immediately disillusioned and are not awkward around
me. It's people who are on the periphery of my social world who
sometimes behave in strange ways because they're into me or
threatened by me.''
</P>
<P>
   Danes also tries to put an anti-egghead spin on her Ivy League
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking a pretty eclectic group of classes. Graphic design,
which is my favorite; an English class; child psychology; women's
health, which is surprisingly boring; and computer science; and the
modern intellectual agenda _ fancy title, not so intimidating.''
</P>
<P>
   Most typical of Danes' college experience so far: no time for
fancy movie star diets and exercise plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of my remain-slim routines have gone right out the
window,'' she says with a laugh. ``I am so inert! And I consume
copious amounts of utter junk.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know, it's been fine. It hasn't had any negative
effect on the way I look. I've realized I was unnecessarily
neurotic about food and things _ because I was encouraged to be.
It's important to be in tune with your body; exercise is really
critical in being a well-rounded person. But it's important, of
course, not to overdo it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who remember Danes' dead-on perfect portrayal of teen
angst in ``My So-Called World'' will be happy to hear that she's
outgrown at least one girlish neurosis. This could mean there's
hope yet for Ally McBeal, Felicity and all the other popular,
self-analyzing TV characters whom Danes' short-lived, pioneering
series inspired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually really flattered that all of these shows are
somewhat derivative of `My So-Called Life,''' she says. ``I have
actually never seen `Ally McBeal' or `Dawson's Creek' or `Felicity'
_ I am totally stupid about pop culture, which is pretty ironic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people were quite untrained to view our show when it
came out,'' she adds. ``They weren't accustomed to being so
confronted by a show, and it was very demanding. But people still
watch it on cable television and video. It's definitely had a
trickle effect.'' &QL;

<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ Maria Paola Sassella is often amused by her
customers, who are experimenting with what for Europeans is still
an unfamiliar practice: shopping on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year, Ms. Sassella's company, Vino Please, has been
selling wines online (www.vinoplease.it). Customers click on
Chianti and Brunello wines to have them delivered anywhere in
Italy, and to Germany and Japan _ or indeed any country where such
sales are permitted. (The United States is not among them.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Some examine my products on the Internet, then fax the order
in,'' she said, with a mix of bemusement and desperation. Many do
not pay with a credit card, but pay later by making a bank
transfer. Moreover, she added, with a sigh of resignation, almost
all her customers are men, who so far dominate Europe's corner of
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans have embraced online shopping, Europeans are
just now warming to electronic commerce. From designing her own
Internet site and persuading diffident wine growers to furnish
products, Ms. Sassella has received an education in how difficult
it is to convince Europeans, who have a wealth of small shops and
age-old shopping habits, that they should shop on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Online shopping accounted for just $1.2 billion of Europe's $1.9
trillion in retail sales last year, compared with $8 billion in
online sales and $2.6 trillion in total sales in the United States,
according to Forrester Research, a market research firm based in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ms. Sassella, who is based in Milan, and other European
online entrepreneurs have reasons to be optimistic. Internet use is
rising in Europe as its cost falls, thanks in large part to the
deregulation of telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Governments, troubled by Europe's lag behind North America, are
pushing for more Internet use in schools, and at work and home. And
the introduction of the euro in 11 European countries is giving
electronic commerce an additional boost because a single currency
makes billing and price comparisons easier.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, online stores are spreading. More than 400 operate
in Italy, compared with 13 just two years ago. In Germany, more
than 1,200 online stores now sell books, and book sales per capita
rival those in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always start late,'' Ms. Sassella said, ``but then it takes
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany, whose 80 million people make it the largest market in
Europe, now has 8.4 million Internet users, 40 percent more than
only six months ago, according to GFK AG, a market research firm
based in Nuremberg. In Italy, there are more than two million
Internet users, 25 percent more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   American companies like IBM, Microsoft and Cisco Systems are
actively promoting electronic commerce among their European
customers. American online merchants are expanding into Europe,
too. Last year, Amazon.com began operations in Britain and Germany,
and Barnes &AMP; Noble linked up with Bertelsmann AG, the German media
giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect big growth, and we expect it to be pervasive,'' said
Jean-Luc Szymanski, who is responsible for electronic commerce at
IBM France. Last year, IBM France sponsored a promotion called Surf
and Buy to lure French merchants like the mail-order house Les
Trois Suisses and Decathlon, a chain of sports megastores, online.
</P>
<P>
   Another area ripe for growth is in electronic commerce between
companies. Walter Poloni, Microsoft's program manager for
electronic commerce in Italy, said that the high density of
mid-sized companies in European countries made them rich markets
for the growth of business-to-business online commerce. In Italy,
for instance, fewer than 1 percent of the country's 3.4 million
companies employ more than 500 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these companies are getting started, but they are one
or two years back with respect to the United States,'' Poloni said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Andreina Mandelli, marketing professor and
director of the Internet Observatory at the business school of
Bocconi University in Milan, was advising a student who wanted to
write a paper about business-to-business electronic commerce. The
student could not find an example in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' professor Mandelli said, ``every day you hear of
another example.'' In the fall of 1997, she surveyed 300 of Italy's
2,000 largest corporations and found that 76 percent were connected
to the Internet; by last fall, the figure had risen to 90 percent.

PRECOCIOUS ACTRESS IN A `MOD' MODE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use  Sunday, March 28  by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES _ Claire Danes has always seemed wise beyond her years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the unusually self-aware high schooler she played on the
ahead-of-its-time TV dramedy ``My So-Called Life'' to the smart,
sensitive teens she's created in such films as ``Home for the
Holidays,'' ``Little Women,'' ``Romeo + Juliet'' and ``To Gillian
on Her 37th Birthday,'' Danes has specialized in girls who act
markedly more mature than most of the adults around them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just shy of her 20th birthday, Danes is doing one of pop
culture's key kids in a grown-up world. She's Julie Barnes in the
big-screen version of ``The Mod Squad,'' that shaggy '60s TV show
in which three young hippie types worked for the Establishment as
undercover cops.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which is set on the fringes of contemporary L.A. club
culture, stars Danes in the old Peggy Lipton role as a recovering
addict, Giovanni Ribisi (``Saving Private Ryan'') as messed-up rich
kid Pete Cochrane and Omar Epps (``Scream 2,'' ``Higher Learning'')
as cool-but-smoldering Lincoln Hayes. All three characters have
traded potential jail sentences for badges (but not guns).
</P>
<P>
   The movie is the latest in a long line of '60s TV retreads, and
it opened Friday to witheringly negative reviews. But the
perceptive and articulate Danes has good reasons for taking on what
she saw as another in a hoped-for continuing series of new
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the most dramatic turn I've taken,'' admits the
waifish blonde, a New Yorker who, at the tender age of 10, began
studying at the prestigious Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute. ``But
it was a really good time. And I think it's important to tackle
different genres and explore the boundaries of film.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it was so much a product of its Generation Gap era, many
have deemed ``Mod Squad'' impossible to update. But Danes believes
that director Scott Silver found a way to make it resonate for
today's youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really focused on the alienation of the characters, which
the TV show only briefly touched on,'' she notes. ``I think that's
extremely relevant to our society today. People feel very
disconnected from each other and are seeking a community that they
can feel a part of. These characters find that in the Squad.''
</P>
<P>
   According to director Silver, Danes' very participation was key
to creating the ``Mod Squad'' film community.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Claire comes aboard, it becomes a different movie,'' he
says. ``She's such a classy actress, and other actors really want
to work with her. And she's an incredibly gifted actor, incredibly
honest, open and natural. She's such an accomplished and mature
actress ... And she's been doing this a lot longer than I have,
which was intimidating in some sense. But she was great to work
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-star Ribisi echoes those sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so beautiful, intelligent and precocious _ I just hate
her!'' Ribisi jokes. ``No, it was really a pleasure and an
opportunity to work with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone has nice things to say about Danes, the one
glaring exception being the Philippine government. After a grueling
experience filming the still-unreleased prison drama ``Brokedown
Palace'' there, Danes complained to the media about conditions in
the island nation. She was subsequently declared persona non grata
by the Manila City Council, which also banned showings of her films
in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go there,'' Danes replies when asked about the
controversy. ``It's so grim, that whole thing. I don't want to talk
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   While that sounds like a typical Hollywood dodge, it's atypical
of Danes. She tries very hard to avoid the usual movie star airs
and actorly pretensions. Indeed, her biggest fear is becoming
cocooned in show-biz hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most destructive part of being an actress in this business
is that you're constantly shielded from spontaneity and real-life
experiences,'' she observes. ``You have a really strong team
(agents, managers, publicists, etc.) that serves as a pretty
impenetrable fortress, and I think that's unfair to a person. It's
really easy to become quite stagnant in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Danes' solution?
</P>
<P>
   ``I ditch 'em!'' she cracks. ``I live in New York, I go to
school, I have a network of friends who are entirely unrelated to
the business. The majority of my friendships are with people like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   She makes one major exception to that rule, however. Danes
shares her New York apartment with Australian singer-songwriter Ben
Lee. The couple has been together for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so in love it's disgusting,'' she jokes. ``My boyfriend's
just a sweetheart. He's really funny, he's really smart, and he
loves me really, really well. That's a quality that people take for
granted; I mean, it's a skill, and not everybody's capable of doing
it. I think that's the most critical quality.''
</P>
<P>
   How old is this girl? Under 30, maybe. But under 20?
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Danes is a freshman at Yale, the alma mater of
her friend and mentor Jodie Foster (plans are in motion for Danes
to star in Foster's next directing effort, the circus story ``Flora
Plum''). When attending classes, she lives in a campus dorm with a
roommate. It's all part of her ongoing effort to lead as normal a
life as she can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I function on campus pretty well,'' she reports. ``People who
meet me are immediately disillusioned and are not awkward around
me. It's people who are on the periphery of my social world who
sometimes behave in strange ways because they're into me or
threatened by me.''
</P>
<P>
   Danes also tries to put an anti-egghead spin on her Ivy League
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking a pretty eclectic group of classes. Graphic design,
which is my favorite; an English class; child psychology; women's
health, which is surprisingly boring; and computer science; and the
modern intellectual agenda _ fancy title, not so intimidating.''
</P>
<P>
   Most typical of Danes' college experience so far: no time for
fancy movie star diets and exercise plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of my remain-slim routines have gone right out the
window,'' she says with a laugh. ``I am so inert! And I consume
copious amounts of utter junk.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know, it's been fine. It hasn't had any negative
effect on the way I look. I've realized I was unnecessarily
neurotic about food and things _ because I was encouraged to be.
It's important to be in tune with your body; exercise is really
critical in being a well-rounded person. But it's important, of
course, not to overdo it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who remember Danes' dead-on perfect portrayal of teen
angst in ``My So-Called World'' will be happy to hear that she's
outgrown at least one girlish neurosis. This could mean there's
hope yet for Ally McBeal, Felicity and all the other popular,
self-analyzing TV characters whom Danes' short-lived, pioneering
series inspired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually really flattered that all of these shows are
somewhat derivative of `My So-Called Life,''' she says. ``I have
actually never seen `Ally McBeal' or `Dawson's Creek' or `Felicity'
_ I am totally stupid about pop culture, which is pretty ironic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people were quite untrained to view our show when it
came out,'' she adds. ``They weren't accustomed to being so
confronted by a show, and it was very demanding. But people still
watch it on cable television and video. It's definitely had a
trickle effect.'' &QL;

JAPANESE STOCKS LOOK BETTER FROM AFAR 
</HEADLINE>

to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual
purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 28)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Never mind that unemployment is rising, consumer
spending and capital investment continue to decline and only
government officials are willing to express confidence that the
economy here will show growth in the fiscal year that begins this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The bulls are on the rampage in Japan, pushing the benchmark
Nikkei 225 stock index up almost 20 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the horned beasts are foreigners, who have piled
back into the market in huge numbers since the beginning of the
year. ``Foreign investors are giving the benefit of the doubt to
Japan,'' said Kathy Matsui, chief strategist at Goldman Sachs
(Japan) Ltd. ``They're seeing a flow of restructuring announcements
and have hopes for additional stimulus on the policy side from the
Bank of Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   In the week that ended March 12, the most recent week for which
data are available, foreigners bought 770 billion yen worth of
stocks, about $6.5 billion at current exchange rates. It was an
even bigger spending spree than in 1994, when, during one week in
February, outsiders spent 540 billion yen, about $5.1 billion, on
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised by this,'' Ms. Matsui said. ``I'm definitely
surprised by the amount of foreign influence we've seen in the
market this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese investors, always more cautious than their foreign
counterparts, are doing exactly the opposite. Everyone from pension
fund managers to bank treasurers is selling or hedging against
future falls in the equity market.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of Japanese fears shows up in the September futures
contracts on the Nikkei. Traders say Japanese banks and life
insurance companies, which maintain large stock portfolios, have
been selling futures contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Such transactions would guarantee them the right to sell the
index in September at current prices, about 16,000. In other words,
even if the Nikkei were to fall to 12,000 by September _ a level no
one now foresees _ they have locked in its current value. Banks and
insurers are thus betting that the Nikkei will tumble.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Japanese investors historically are bearish on
Japanese stocks at this time of year, in part because they suspect
the government of artificially propping up share prices in ``price
keeping operations'' designed to insure that the value of corporate
and bank portfolios is robust when the books are closed on March
31. The government never confirms such operations.
</P>
<P>
   So what do foreign investors see in Japanese stocks that
Japanese investors do not? The biggest factor seems to be the
belief that a quiet revolution is occurring in corporate Japan that
will transform lumbering, loss-producing Japanese companies into
nimble, moneymaking global competitors.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Japanese companies _ Toshiba, Sony, Sumitomo Rubber
Industries, to name a few _ have embarked on what could be major
overhauls of their operations, and their efforts have gained a
flurry of press attention. Not only are they paring their labor
forces (though such measures mean less in a time of deflation),
they are also streamlining their businesses and embracing new
management philosophies.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Asahi Chemical. In January, it announced that it would
sell its food business to Japan Tobacco. The company is shutting
down its chemical fertilizer operations, and analysts believe that
it may pull out of the petrochemical business altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really just nibbling around the edges so far,'' Garry
Evans, the strategist at HSBC Securities in Tokyo, said of Asahi's
efforts. ``But they've taken steps in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that dramatic changes like those at Asahi
Chemical have received such widespread coverage in the foreign
press _ always desperate for signs of change _ that there is a
danger of perceiving a revolution when what is happening may be far
more evolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 70 companies that have announced plans to ``restructure''
since the beginning of the year, only 22 have actual cost-cutting
targets that can be identified, according to Evans _ and, on
average, the goal for cost reduction is just 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, then, that the more cautious Japanese investor is
hedging his or her bets.

FLOURISH OF FINNS HIGHLIGHTS OJAI BOWL EVENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use  Sunday, March 28  by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Are you Finnished yet? You will be if you attend
this summer's Ojai Music Festival, which celebrates Finnish music
and musicians. Don't laugh _ according to festival organizers,
Finland has only 5 million people, but 29 symphony orchestras. You
may also have heard of native sons Jean Sibelius and Esa-Pekka
Salonen, conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   Salonen will be featured as both a conductor and composer at the
festival. Other highlights of the June 4-6 main festival include
two U.S. premieres of pieces by this year's composer-in-residence,
Finn Magnus Lindberg, and two performances by renowned American
soprano Dawn Upshaw.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, now in its 53rd year, has often championed
adventurous, contemporary programming. It's also very affordable,
if you're willing to sit on the lawn at the Libbey Bowl or attend
some of the more offbeat events.
</P>
<P>
   This year, members of the Finnish avant garde/jazz-influenced
Toimii Ensemble will perform at two Sundowner Concerts at the Ojai
Art Center, next to the bowl. Tickets for these performances cost
just $5 per person, open seating; an art exhibit of contemporary
Finnish glasswork and ceramics on June 2 (which continues through
the month) is free (call 805-646-0117 for information; for opening
night reservations, call 805-646-2094).
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to the main events at the Libbey Bowl start at $12 for
lawn seating and range up to $42 per ticket for the best seats.
Full series tickets range from $60 (lawn) to $198. A few words of
warning: Daytime concerts in the June sun can get very hot on the
lawn. And, unlike at the Hollywood Bowl, alcohol is not officially
allowed (though patrons have been known to practice artful
disguise).
</P>
<P>
   Below is a list of the main concerts. To order tickets, call
805-646-2053.
</P>
<P>
   June 4: At 8:15 p.m. Salonen conducts the Los Angeles
Philharmonic, soprano Dawn Upshaw and cellist Anssi Karttunen.
Salonen: ``Giro'' (U.S. premiere). Lindberg: cello concerto (U.S.
premiere). Salonen: ``Sappho Fragments'' (world premiere) Sibelius:
Symphony No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   June 5: At 10 a.m. there is a special family concert. Salonen
introduces and directs the Toimii Ensemble in ``Toimii Goes
Opera.'' (Note: This concert is open seating, flat price of $6 per
adult. Children under 17 attend free with voucher.) At 3 p.m. is a
recital by pianist Olli Mustonen, playing preludes and fugues by
Bach and Shostakovich. At 8:30 p.m. Salonen conducts the Los
Angeles Philharmonic New Music Group, cellist Anssi Karttunen and
trumpeter Thomas Stevens. Program includes Berio: Kol-Od for
Trumpet and Ensemble (U.S. premiere), Saariaho's ``Amers'' and
Adams' chamber symphony.
</P>
<P>
   June 6: At 11 a.m. there is a recital by soprano Upshaw (piano
accompanist and program to be announced). At 5:30 p.m. Salonen
conducts the Toimii Ensemble and pianist Olli Mustonen, performing
Schumann's piano quintet and Lindberg's ``Kraft'' (U.S. premiere).

DUTOIT SHARES SPOTLIGHT WITH POULENC AND YOUNG CELLIST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)   By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Conductors generally know what their strengths are or
at least what the public perceives as their strengths, and although
some occasionally rebel against their reputations and try to play
against type, most keep close to what works for them.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dutoit has been successful with early-20th-century
showpieces, works that dazzle with bright hues and picturesque
effects and that use volume to pack a visceral wallop. For his
visit to the New York Philharmonic, which began on Thursday evening
and ends Saturday night, he did the sensible thing, which was to
draw on that repertory.
</P>
<P>
   More sensible still, he balanced the familiar and the novel in
an unusual way. The two pillars of the program, Poulenc's
orchestral suite from his 1924 ballet, ``Les Biches,'' and Holst's
mighty astronomical compendium, ``The Planets,'' are works
listeners know well from recordings, but that don't find their way
onto concert programs that often, at least in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Les Biches'' inhabits the nether region that ballet scores
call home; only Stravinsky's have achieved full-fledged symphonic
stature. ``The Planets'' requires an organ. Avery Fisher Hall
doesn't have one (nor does Carnegie), and orchestras tend to
dislike the available solution, which is to use an electronic
organ, as the Philharmonic did on Thursday. Four speaker columns
descending from the ceiling were reminders that the hall is
insufficiently equipped.
</P>
<P>
   It is not as though ``The Planets'' were an organ concerto, of
course, nor is the organ line as prominent as it is in the
Saint-Saens Third Symphony, another casualty of this shortcoming of
New York's concert halls. Holst's greatest demands are on the
orchestra's brass, which punch out the bellicose chords of ``Mars''
and sing with lyrical abandon in ``Venus.''
</P>
<P>
   Brass playing has not been the Philharmonic's great strength
over the last dozen years, but in the last few weeks the orchestra
has performed several brass-heavy works, and the playing has been
spectacular. Philip Myers' horn solos in ``Venus'' were impeccable,
both in pitch and in shapeliness, and throughout the suite,
particularly in Dutoit's fluid account of ``Jupiter,'' the horn,
trumpet and trombone choirs played with a solidity that gave
Holst's tone paintings both power and dimension. The strings
contributed notably as well, both in the hefty, long-lined melodies
of ``Jupiter'' and the icy shimmer that, in league with the women's
voices of the Judith Clurman chorale, illuminated the mystical side
of ``Neptune.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Poulenc, the brass share the spotlight with the winds,
both central components in the Gallic urbanity that Poulenc
projects. ``Les Biches,'' revived in honor of the composer's
centenary, reveals Stravinsky's pervasive influence on young
composers in the century's early decades, but it also shows
Poulenc's determination to find his own distinctive voice.

<P>
   Dutoit put the weight of his reading at the service of that
distinctiveness, emphasizing the characteristically French
sensuality in the opening Rondeau, the easygoing charm of the slow
movements and the light-spirited fleetness of the hornpipelike
closing Presto.
</P>
<P>
   Between the Poulenc, which opened the program, and the Holst,
which closed it, Han-Na Chang made her Philharmonic debut as the
soloist in the Saint-Saens Cello Concerto No. 1. Ms. Chang, who won
the Rostropovich International Cello Competition when she was 11,
is now 16. Technically, she is agile and focused, and gets a good
variety of timbres from her instrument. If her interpretation was
hard driven and slightly airless at first, when she lightened her
touch, the music floated appealingly.

AMERICAN PUBLIC DECIDEDLY AMBIVALENT ON KOSOVO ACTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton sent Americans to their almanacs
for a crash course on the Balkans this week, but the lesson has
failed to convince a skeptical public that Kosovo is worth dying
for.
</P>
<P>
   After three days of U.S. and NATO air strikes against Serbian
forces, polls consistently show that Americans are confused about
the roots of the conflict, pessimistic about the chance of success
and deeply concerned about the possible loss of American lives.
</P>
<P>
   The ambivalence of average Americans mirrors the misgivings of
many foreign policy experts. As each day brings new risk of allied
casualties, skeptics continue to question the wisdom of U.S.
involvement in a region that has been a tinderbox of ethnic tension
for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of enthusiasm for the Kosovo mission underscores the
political risks for Clinton, a lame duck president whose
credibility has been battered by the White House sex scandal. Even
the president's supporters concede that the public mood could sour
quickly if there are significant American losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Support is remarkably thin, given that the fighting has
started. That's usually when the rally-round-the-flag effect
starts,'' said William Hartung, an arms control expert at the World
Policy Institute, a foreign policy research center in New York.
``That hasn't happened in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   In a striking departure from previous military actions,
traditional expressions of support for U.S. troops from members of
Congress have been accompanied by stinging denunciations of their
mission. Rather than rallying behind the president, some of
Clinton's critics seem to be closing ranks for an I-told-you-so
chorus if things go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, reiterated his opposition as the first
wave of bombs and missiles thundered into Serbian targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``American soldiers should be ordered into battle only when the
vital national interests of the United States are at stake,'' he
said in a prepared statement. ``To risk American lives for anything
less is wrong and I cannot and will not support it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some key allies of Clinton in previous military excursions have
bailed out on his latest use of force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not been this uneasy about any American military action
since I left government,'' former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger said on ABC's ``Nightline'' program. ``We will win the
first round, but my nightmare is what happens as this unfolds.''
</P>
<P>
   Separate polls for CNN, CBS and the Los Angeles Times indicate
that Americans with far less foreign policy experience have similar
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In all three polls, a slim majority of the respondents supported
the air strikes despite their reservations. But the national
telephone surveys also showed that most Americans expect U.S.
casualties and adamantly oppose the use of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Only 34 percent of the respondents in a CBS poll of 527 adults
Wednesday felt that the goal of ending Serbian attacks on ethnic
Albanians would be worth the loss of American lives.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN poll of 675 adults found that most Americans do not think
any vital U.S. interests are at stake in the conflict. Fewer than
half thought the mission would succeed.
</P>
<P>
   In a Los Angeles Times poll of 544 adults Thursday, only 36
percent predicted that the air strikes would lead to a peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   All three polls have a margin of error of plus or minus 4
percentage points, meaning that the results could be off that much
in either direction because of sampling errors.
</P>
<P>
   The other notable consistency in the polls is the lack of
knowledge about the Balkans. Most Americans cannot name the warring
factions whose dispute in the former Yugoslavia has triggered the
international crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a third of the respondents in a Fox News poll could not
say which side NATO forces are bombing, and 9 percent incorrectly
guessed that the attacks are aimed at ethnic Albanians, the people
that NATO forces are trying to protect.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of the adults contacted in the CBS poll had no
opinion on the air strikes, a level of uncertainty unmatched in the
network's previous polls on recent military operations in Iraq,
Afghanistan, Sudan, Bosnia, Haiti and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is way behind the curve on this,'' said Rep. Martin
Frost, D-Dallas, who supports the Kosovo operation. ``Any president
who commits American forces needs to make the case with the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who urged Americans to consult an almanac in a speech
to a labor group Tuesday, readily acknowledged the difficulties in
making a convincing case for the use of force.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a slam-dunk,'' he said. ``This is a difficult
decision. I believe that the position I have taken is the best of a
lot of bad alternatives. But you didn't just hire me to make the
easy decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   His supporters in Congress can only hope that he is right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we ought to give the president the benefit of the
doubt and hope the policy works,'' Frost said. ``There will be
plenty of time for talk about it if it doesn't work out.''

ITALIANS ARE BEAUTIFUL: BENIGNI'S UNBRIDLED JOY RUNS AWAY WITH OUR
HEARTS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by BENIGNI-SPEECH and BENIGNI-SOPHIA) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one in Hollywood steps on Steven Spielberg. Except Roberto
Benigni. Last Sunday night, this goofy-haired, rubber-legged
Italian taught us that sometimes, the greatest joy knows no
etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   It is a scene we'll see again and again, as long as there are
Oscar-night reminiscences. A ravishing Sophia Loren announces the
winner for Best Foreign Film _ Benigni's ``Life Is Beautiful.''
Benigni thrusts his legs into the air and climbs the seats in front
of him, including that of Spielberg, who reaches to clasp Benigni's
hands in an act of both congratulation and self-preservation. Then
comes Benigni's bunny hop up the stairs to the podium, and an
acceptance speech just this side of gibberish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like now, ready to dive in this ocean of generosity,''
he bellows. ``This is too much!''
</P>
<P>
   He was honored for a movie set in a Nazi concentration camp. The
film's look at the evils there, while unusual, is unstinting.
Clearly, there is a time to cry. But even in the sorrow, Benigni
seemed to insist on Sunday, life IS beautiful. Sorrow is but a
necessary counterpoint to joy, and when it comes, joy should be
embraced with the fervor of a child.
</P>
<P>
   Benigni's reaction to his Oscar triumphs (he also won Best
Actor) will live among the century's most enduring and endearing
public displays of exuberance. Benigni made the acceptance speech
of Cuba Gooding Jr. a few years back look morose by comparison. He
stepped on Spielberg's chair, and in the process, lifted our
spirits.
</P>
<P>
   JOY OUT OF SADNESS: Italy has known his happy example for years.
He grew up there in poverty but was a class clown, his comedic
talents inspired and supported by his parents and older sisters.
His Chaplinesque farces eventually made him Italy's biggest star
and moneymaker.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the slapstick genius was the lesson gained from a
father who survived a Nazi work camp, an experience the older man
spoke about obsessively for years. Eventually, to spare his
children, Benigni's father began to describe the old horrors in a
different way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started to use the story with gladness, in a very light
way, trying to be light and funny because it happened also some
funny stories there,'' Benigni recently told Charlie Rose. ``When
he started to smile, he stopped have nightmares also. So, it was
over. So this was very touching to me ... this moment when he
started to tell his story in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   So Benigni tells us the familiar story in a different way, too.
A father and son are trucked off to a concentration camp. But in
``Life Is Beautiful,'' this father spares the child from the worst
horror with laughter, by transforming the experience into a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tragedy and comedy,'' Benigni would tell Rose later. ``They
sometimes touch. No? ... Sometimes only clowns can reach some
summit of tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   But from the back of Spielberg's seat, we witnessed the summit
of joy. As well as anyone, Benigni knows that the two go
hand-in-hand, always touching. There was one part of his speech
Sunday that was not gibberish at all:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank those who are not here,'' he told the audience
of stars, and of millions watching at home, ``who gave their lives
so that we can say, `Life Is Beautiful.' ''

   So just what did Roberto Benigni say when he accepted those
Oscars? Here's our translation:
</P>
<P>
   BEST FOREIGN FILM (presented by Sophia Loren):
</P>
<P>
   Thank you! Oh, grazie! Grazie! Thank you, Sophia! I
(unintelligible) the Oscar, but I want you! I want to be rocketed
by the waves of your beauty! Come here! Thank you! Thank you! This
is a moment of joy! And I want to kiss everybody because you are
the measure of the joy! And he who kisses the joy as it flies,
lives an eternity sunrise, said the poet! (Note: That's what we
heard. The captioning read `` ... lives entirely in our eyes.'')
And this is wonderful to be here! Wonderful! I feel like now, ready
to ... to ... to dive in this ocean of generosity! This is too
much! Your generosity _ is an uh, how do you say, the rain ... the
... the ... the hailstorm! It's a hailstorm of ... of ... of
kindness, of gratitude for you. And really, I'd like to thank
everybody did the movie, because without them I couldn't fly with
this movie! Everybody who did, the producer, the screenwriter,
(unintelligible) ... Harvey Weinstein of Miramax Films, thank you
very much for what you did! And also I would like to thank my
parents in (unintelligible), the little village in Italy. They gave
me the biggest gift of all _ poverty, and I want to thank them for
the rest of my life! Really, but thank you Mama and Papa! And thank
you for your love! Because the reason I am here is because people
loved the movie! It's always a question of love! I would like to
dedicate this prize to those who are not here! They gave their life
in order we can say, `Life is beautiful!' And I would like to say,
a kiss to Giorgio Cantarini, Giorgio the little boy (who played
Benigni's son in the movie), and because we are talking the love,
(speaks Italian) ... and love is a divinity. Sometimes, if you are
afraid, like all the divinities, it can appear. That's why I want
to dedicate this prize to Nicoletta Braschi (Benigni's wife and
co-star)!''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTOR
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you! This is a terrible mistake, because I used up all
my English! I don't know ... (stammers) ... I'm not able to express
all my gratitude because my body is in tumult! Because it's a
colossal moment of joy! So I-I-I (fumbles for words) cannot
express! I would like to be Jupiter and kidnap everybody and lie
down in the firmament making love to everybody! Because I don't
know how to express _ It's a question of love! This is a mountain
of snow so delicate, and the suavity and kindness, and it's
something I cannot forget from the bottom of my heart! Thank you
for the Academy Awards, for who really loved the movie, thank you
to all _ in Italy, for the Italian cinema, grazie Italia!''

   LOS ANGELES _ ``Eyes Wide Shut'' remains Hollywood's
longest-running mystery, tantalizing insiders for the past four
years as perfectionist director Stanley Kubrick labored over the
sexual drama.
</P>
<P>
   It has also clearly become the leading candidate for the year
2000 Academy Awards. And even though Kubrick managed to keep most
details about the project secret, it had attained front-runner
status long before Kubrick's unexpected death on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut'' was an Oscar contender from the moment Warner
Bros. announced in late 1995 that Kubrick would start shooting in
mid-1996. Production began in November 1996, and had it been
finished in a typical amount of time, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' would have
been a major challenger to ``Titanic'' last year or ``Saving
Private Ryan'' and ``Shakespeare in Love'' this year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' needed a stunning 15 months of
production, numerous reshoots and a million feet of film to reach
completion.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Kubrick's secretive methods generated a continual
buzz. Actors had to sign agreements not to talk to the press, and
shooting scripts were kept under strict security. The drama is said
to be about a pair of married psychiatrists (played by the married
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman) and their sexual lives, but only a
few Warner executives, Cruise and Kidman, and Pat Kingsley, a top
public relations executive, have seen the film.
</P>
<P>
   On March 10, a 90-second clip from the film was shown to
thousands of theater exhibitors at the Showest convention in Las
Vegas. The excerpt included an explicit nude scene of Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick's track record ensures ``Eyes Wide Shut'' will receive
the most serious consideration from the academy. It is only his
seventh film over the last 35 years, but that list includes ``Dr.
Strangelove,'' ``The Shining,'' ``Barry Lyndon,'' ``Full Metal
Jacket,'' ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' and ``A Clockwork Orange.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to predict Academy Award nominees is to look at
the director,'' noted Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel
Source forecasting service. ``Anything by Kubrick is going to be a
major film. His death is going to help memorialize not just `Eyes
Wide Shut' but all his work.''
</P>
<P>
   The original thinking in Hollywood was that Warner Bros. would
probably release the movie late in the year. That's because if a
studio releases a serious movie in December, it's a clear signal
that it's aiming for Oscar nominations, because academy members
tend to prefer recently released movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If `Saving Private Ryan' had been released in December, there
is no way that `Shakespeare in Love' would have had more
nominations,'' Bucksbaum noted. ``And without a doubt, `The Truman
Show' would have gotten a best picture nomination if it had been
released in December.''
</P>
<P>
   But movies with Tom Cruise don't come along very often _ this is
his first since ``Mission: Impossible'' two years ago _ so giving
it a prime slot in the middle of summer makes solid sense from a
box-office standpoint. ``Saving Private Ryan,'' ``Braveheart'' and
``Forrest Gump'' cleaned up after opening during the summer and
were still able to rack up plenty of Oscar nominations half a year
later.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``The Thin Red Line''
were easy to identify as lead contenders for this year's Academy
Awards, given the presence of Steven Spielberg and Terrence Malick
as directors and the ultra-serious subject matter. But Spielberg
and Malick are absent this year, so ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is far and
away the logical candidate so far.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, studio executives are already wondering how to
create the elusive Oscar buzz such as that surrounding
``Shakespeare in Love'' in the last few months. But that's tricky.
At this point last year, for example, Miramax thought its strongest
contenders would be ``Little Voice'' and ``The Castle,'' an
Australian comedy now due out in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time a year ago, we really didn't know what
`Shakespeare in Love' would become,'' recalls Mark Gill, president
of Miramax's West Coast operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of luck, and none of these things go on
forever,'' he replied. ``I'm sure there will be some years where we
don't do well. It's impossible to have this kind of performance
every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it will be surprising if Miramax is not a formidable
presence at next year's Oscar ceremonies, most likely to be held
March 26, 2000. The Disney-owned studio copped 21 nominations this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Gill said the best early candidates for the year 2000 ceremonies
include:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mansfield Park,'' based on Jane Austen's novel, with Embeth
Davidtz and Jonny Lee Miller. It's due out in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy Smoke,'' a romantic comedy directed by Jane Campion and
starring Kate Winslet as an Australian girl who falls under the
influence of a guru in India. Harvey Keitel plays a cult-buster
with a romantic interest. It's scheduled for the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules,'' with Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron
and Michael Caine in a romance-drama that begins in an orphanage.
It's set for the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax is also co-producing a potentially strong candidate with
Paramount, ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' which stars Gwyneth
Paltrow, Cate Blanchett, Jude Law and Matt Damon and is directed by
Anthony Minghella in his first project since ``The English
Patient.'' Due out in November, ``Ripley'' is set in Italy during
the 1950s with Damon as an American expatriate specializing in
murder.
</P>
<P>
   For Miramax and the rest of the so-called independents, Oscar
nominations are a critical marketing tool enabling them to stand
out from the plethora of major studio films and the explosion of
indie fare. Lion's Gate Entertainment, for example, made a big
splash with five major nominations this year for two films it
acquired at last year's Sundance festival _ ``Affliction'' and
``Gods and Monsters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't look for films with the idea that they're going to
receive specific award consideration,'' said Tom Ortenberg,
president of Lion's Gate. ``I think that's a sucker's game. To have
acquired two films like we did last year out of the same festival
was extraordinary, so we were not expecting it to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that qualifier, Lion's Gate has two early Oscar 2000
candidates:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Violin,'' a drama with Samuel L. Jackson and Greta
Scacchi that will open in June. The film, which has grossed $2.5
million in Canada, consists of five vignettes over four centuries
showing how the instrument has affected a variety of lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it will be the art-house hit of the summer,''
Ortenberg said. ``There was some thought given to holding it until
later, but there are a lot of great promotional opportunities with
a concert series. We're releasing at the best time for its
commercial prospects, and we'll worry about the awards later.''
</P>
<P>
   ``American Psycho,'' which began production last week and is
pegged for a November release. Based on Brett Easton Ellis'
controversial novel, it drew significant heat last year when
Leonardo DiCaprio was expected to star, but that deal never
materialized. Christian Bale is the lead with Reese Witherspoon,
Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto and Samantha Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   Several other projects look promising, according to studio
insiders:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; ``The Green Mile,'' directed by Frank Darabont in a Stephen
King story with Tom Hanks as a Death Row guard. It's due in
December from Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; ``Angela's Ashes,'' directed by Alan Parker and based on
Frank McCourt's memoir of his childhood in Ireland. The Paramount
project, with Emily Watson and Robert Carlyle, has no release date
and may not qualify this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; ``All the Pretty Horses,'' directed by Billy Bob Thornton
and starring Matt Damon as a cowboy coming of age in Mexico and
Texas in 1949. Sony plans a November release.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; ``The Story of Us,'' a drama directed by Rob Reiner with
Bruce Willis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Paul Reiser. Universal has set
a Dec. 17 release.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; ``Joan of Arc,'' directed by Luc Besson with Milla Jovavich,
Dustin Hoffman and Faye Dunaway. Sony has set it for Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; ``Snow Falling on Cedars,'' directed by Scott Hicks with
Ethan Hawke and James Cromwell, set on a Northwest island in the
'50s and based on David Guterson's novel. Originally set for last
December, Universal now plans a fall release.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; ``Breakfast of Champions,'' directed by Alan Rudolph with
Bruce Willis and Nick Nolte, based on the Kurt Vonnegut novel.
Disney has not set a release date other than later this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; ``The General's Daughter,'' directed by Simon West,
featuring John Travolta investigating a murder. Based on Nelson
DeMille's best seller, it also stars Madeleine Stowe, James
Cromwell and James Woods. Paramount will release it on June 11.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; ``Three Seasons,'' directed by Tony Bui and starring Harvey
Keitel and several Vietnamese actors in a saga of modern-day
Saigon. It became the first film at Sundance to win the Grand Jury
Prize and Audience Award. October Films, which scored two major
nominations for ``Hilary and Jackie,'' has set an April release.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; ``Jakob the Liar,'' directed by Peter Kassovitz and starring
Robin Williams as a cafe owner in Nazi-occupied Poland. Sony plans
an October release.

SOPHIA STILL WINS THE `AMORE' OF AUDIENCES
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies BENIGNI-OSCAR) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just from appearances, they made an odd couple up there on the
Oscar stage _ the impossibly wacky Roberto Benigni, the impossibly
gorgeous Sophia Loren.
</P>
<P>
   But Loren was the perfect choice to present the Oscar to her
countryman. Like Benigni, she first came to major American notice
for an Italian film in which she played a starring role; hers was
``Two Women,'' for which she became the first foreign actress to
win a Best Actress Oscar nearly 40 years ago. That she got to pass
on an Oscar to her friend Benigni was an ideal bit of Hollywood
typecasting: When she waved the envelope aloft and joyously cried,
``Roberto!'' there could not have been an audience member who
didn't feel her warmth and exhilaration.
</P>
<P>
   In the decades since her debut, of course, Loren has become a
legend, the result of her beauty and sensuality and earthiness as
much as her acting. Just look at how the crowd swooned when Loren
came out as a ``presenter'' during the Oscars. This, despite the
fact that many in the audience had probably seen few of her films
on the big screen. Indeed, when you look at Loren's filmography,
you'll find such notorious misfires as ``A Countess From Hong
Kong,'' ``Man of La Mancha'' and ``Ready to Wear.''
</P>
<P>
   This, truly, is a definition of a star: No matter how many times
your films disappoint, the public will forgive you and adore you.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some Loren films worthy of praise:
</P>
<P>
   ``Houseboat'': Loren had been paired with Cary Grant before, in
the misguided 19th-century action pic ``The Pride and the
Passion,'' but this 1958 film was an improvement: She becomes
Grant's housekeeper and surrogate mother to his kids, in the kind
of fluffy romantic comedy Grant excelled at.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Women'': Loren won her Best Actress Oscar _ the last
acting Oscar for a foreign-film performance until Benigni's win
this year _ for this wrenching survival story about a woman and her
daughter who are raped by Allied Moroccan soldiers during World War
II. Vittorio De Sica, one of Italy's top filmmakers, directed the
1960 film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow'': Loren teamed with De Sica
again for this 1964 trio of vignettes about women's, er, persuasive
effect on men. Featuring Loren's infamous striptease for frequent
co-star Marcello Mastroianni, which Robert Altman paid tribute to
in the otherwise lumpy ``Ready to Wear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Arabesque'': Lighthearted _ which almost goes without saying
with a Stanley Donen film _ espionage tale pairs Loren with Gregory
Peck in this 1966 movie about an assassination plot. Made during
Donen's ``If Hitchcock can do it, so can I!'' period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cassandra Crossing'': One of many '70s all-star disaster
movies, this 1976 film about a plague-plagued train bound for a
weakened bridge (two disasters in one!) included Loren in its
all-star cast. It also included O.J. Simpson, but at the time it
was considered one of the better entries in the genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grumpier Old Men'': Loren's most recent performance (1995)
cast her as Walter Matthau's love interest. Now that's acting!

GAME CREATOR NOTCHES HIS FIRST FILM _ NOW WHAT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When game guru Chris Roberts was tapped to direct
a movie version of his ``Wing Commander'' series of videogames, a
few eyebrows arched.
</P>
<P>
   What, some wondered, was a gamer doing directing a big-time
(well, relatively speaking) film?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   At the film's premiere in Westwood recently, Roberts said it
wasn't a big jump for him to do a $25 million effects-laden
picture. After all, his last game, Wing Commander IV, had a $12
million budget, tons of full-motion video segments and a cast that
included Mark Hamill, Malcolm McDowell and John Rhys-Davies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the big difference: When I make a computer game, it's
longer and more drawn out, more interactive. And if something
doesn't work, I can go back and change it,'' Roberts said.
``Filmmaking is more cut and dried.''
</P>
<P>
   The storytelling is equally compact in a film compared to a
game, Roberts said. Wing Commander IV, for instance, normally gives
a player 20 to 30 hours of entertainment, compared to the 1{ to two
hours of most movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a much bigger canvas to work with'' in a game,
Roberts said. ``With film, you have two hours to nail it.''
</P>
<P>
   He did in a fun little film that makes for perfect summer fare
in any summer that doesn't have the next ``Star Wars'' film coming
out. That's why the movie was released in mid-March, in about 2,000
theaters nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   `It's World War II in space,'' Roberts said. ``It definitely has
an old-time war movie feel. I could have made it a lot more like
the Wing Commander game, but I made a conscious decision to make it
look different, to give it its own personality.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie opened modestly, with about $8.9 million in box-office
receipts in its first 10 days. Of course, it'll play not only in
the United States, but overseas and should have a long life in
video, so there's a good chance it'll make back its money and more.
</P>
<P>
   Having survived his first movie, Roberts would like to do
another, with a bigger budget, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically feel like I'm starting out with making movies,''
Roberts said. After ``taking everything I loved about movies and
(trying) to get it into games,'' he now wants to take what he's
learned in both game and film creation and make more films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a stack of scripts to read,'' Roberts said. ``I like
escapist fantasy things that take you to another world. I'm less
interested in doing another buddy cop movie.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; HALL OF FAMER
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of game gurus, Sid Meier has to be somewhere around the
top of any list of influential game designers of the past couple of
decades.
</P>
<P>
   And the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences recognized just
that when it announced this week that Meier would be the second
person inducted into its Hall of Fame. The ceremony will take place
during the first night of the Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3,
the massive game-industry convention returning to Los Angeles on
May 13.
</P>
<P>
   Meier is perhaps best-known for creating Civilization and
Civilization II, the magnificently balanced ``God'' games that let
players create and develop civilizations around the world,
investing in technology, commerce, infrastructure and military
while exploring the world around them.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, he released a space-based game of somewhat
similar proportions, the widely praised Alpha Centauri, and also
created Gettysburg and Railroad Tycoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's recognized as one of the true pioneers of interactive
gaming,'' said Glenn Entis, the academy's chairman of the board.
``This year it (picking a nominee) was a very easy decision,
looking at Sid's background and contributions to the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Meier grew up in Michigan and studied computer science at the
University of Michigan before moving to Baltimore for a computer
job. But in 1982, bitten with the gaming bug, he quit to co-found
MicroProse, where he wrote the first-ever flight simulator game,
F-15 Strike Eagle.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of that genre-starter, and of subsequent ones such
as Civilization and Railroad Tycoon, was a major reason for Meier's
induction, Entis said.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Meier left the now-giant MicroProse to create
Firaxis Games, where he could concentrate on his main interest _
writing games _ without worrying about the headaches of
distribution and marketing. Firaxis is based in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Meier said the secret to his many great games is his own
enjoyment of playing games, despite the fact that, at 45, he's too
old to have grown up playing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that comes through: that somebody who loves games put
these things together,'' Meier said. ``It wasn't some committee
that decided on this feature or that, or somebody who thought they
could just take a license (from some movie or TV show) and put
something together that might sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he chooses topics that have fascinated him for years,
and turns them into games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The games are just something I think were cool, like when I
was growing up and really liked trains,'' he said. ``I'm just
trying to capture the fun you thought was there.''
</P>
<P>
   His favorite recent games created by others include StarCraft,
SimCity 3000 and Diablo, he said. And playing them regularly with
his 8-year-old son helps keep him young.
</P>
<P>
   Meier started out writing tiny, floppy-based games that had
three-page manuals and were wrapped in plastic baggies. Now they're
shrink-wrapped boxes of CD-ROMS with extraordinary graphics and
sounds bringing complex simulations to life. But the business
hasn't changed that much, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a lot less different than you might think,'' Meier
said. ``The technology has come a long way, of course. I used to
write games (that would fit) in 64K (of computer memory). But
really, the core of a game has changed a lot less. You're still
trying to capture a gamer's imagination and make them the star of
the story, instead of just watching it.''
</P>
<P>
   The big technological changes in recent times have been limited,
Meier have been really been limited to two, Meier said. One was the
de facto standardization by gamers on the Windows-based PC as the
platform of choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started, we were writing on four or five platforms, and
it added a lot of overhead,'' Meier said. ``And ports (of a game
from one platform to another) are never as good as a game written
specifically for a platform. I think that's been a real positive
development for games.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Internet has created a near-instant feedback
loop between gamers and designers that quickly hones products.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we released Civilization, it was a month or two before we
got any feedback about how it was doing,'' Meier said. ``Today, you
send out a demo (on the Internet), and within two hours there's a
discussion thread (on the game's Web site) with 100 posts. That
really changes the way you put games together. You've got to have
quality in there; you can't just put the game out and hope it will
sell.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame nomination was a bit of a shock for Meier
because such honors often imply that a winner's best days may be
behind him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was certainly surprised,'' Meier said. ``I don't see myself
as winding down.''
</P>
<P>
   And no one should expect Meier to slow down, Entis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because our industry is so new, even our pioneers aren't close
to retirement,'' said Entis, the CEO of DreamWorks Interactive.
``Even though the Hall of Fame is based on past achievement, it
also means watch for things to come.''

`PLEASANTVILLE': IN LIVING COLOR ON DVD

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It may pain the film purists, but sometimes
digital really can be the way to go in watching some movies.
Certainly, the folks over New Line Cinema would make a case for
that regarding the DVD version of ``Pleasantville,'' which will be
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The good-natured tale of '90s-era youths transported into a
black-and-white 1950s world used impressive special effects to
selectively color parts of the screen, as the transported youths
change the way the community thinks of itself and each other.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, said New Line vice president for post-production
Evan Edelist, ``the color really becomes a character in the
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating 1,700 special-effects shots involved a torturous
process that involved shooting the film in color, then converting
it back and forth between a digital version and film version a
couple of times, while stripping out all color and selectively
reintroducing it.
</P>
<P>
   The result smoothed out the transitions between color areas and
black-and-white ones, but is best seen in a digital format. Thus,
Edelist said, ``the DVD is the most representative of the vision of
director Gary Ross, the director of photography and the color
effects team.''
</P>
<P>
   The DVD version does look smashing, and the disc comes with a
ton of extras (beyond a really fine movie) that make the release
one of the more satisfying in recent times.
</P>
<P>
   Aong the features are an audio track featuring Ross' comments on
the film; another audio track featuring composer Randy Newman's
comments on his Oscar-nominated score; and a ``special effects film
school'' feature describing how some scenes were created.
</P>
<P>
   It also has the terrific Fiona Apple music video of ``Across the
Universe,'' created for the film by ``Boogie Nights'' director Paul
Thomas Andersen; a look at the two fat volumes of storyboards Ross
created in planning the film; and a visit to East L.A. muralist
Frank Romero's studio, where he discusses the mural he created for
the film.
</P>
<P>
   The disc also includes some computer-only features such as a
complete script, tied to storyboards, that can be printed or used
to jump through scenes in the film. A complete cast and crew list
links to the Internet Movie Database to provide always up-to-date
information about each participant.
</P>
<P>
   This is pleasant viewing indeed.

   KOSOVO-RDP (Washington) _ As NATO forces stepped up their
bombing assault into the daylight hours, President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia maintained fierce resistance both on the
ground and in the air. Two of his MIG-29 fighters shot down on what
NATO claimed was a foray into neighboring Bosnia. The sweep by Serb
troops through the ethnic Albanian villages of Kosovo continued
unabated, NATO said, despite the third straight day of air assaults
that NATO officials emphasized would be unrelenting until Milosevic
accepted peace. By Francis X. Clines and Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO-ASSESS (Brussels, Belgium) _ The allied military
strategy for stopping Serbian attacks against ethnic Albanian
rebels in Kosovo rests largely on the hope of a specific Serbian
response to the heavy NATO bombing that began on Wednesday,
according to officials here. The hope, allied officers and
diplomats say, is that intense airstrikes will cause so much damage
to Yugoslavia's army and its sophisticated air-defense system that
Serb commanders may soon pressure him to back down and accept
allied terms before they lose everything. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-YUGOSLAVIA (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ Whispers about a
face-saving Serbian loss to the world's most powerful military
alliance began here long before NATO bombs started to fall.
Surrendering control of Kosovo through peaceful negotiation would
be humiliating. But a hard military loss of Kosovo, after a brave
and hopeless struggle against an overwhelming Western foe, could be
just the ticket that Milosevic needs to survive with his Serbian
manhood and his rule intact. By Blaine Harden.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SERB (Washington) _ On reports of new Serb massacres,
other atrocities. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-INFORMATION (Washington) _ In the 1991 Gulf War, the
military gave detailed briefings twice a day, in Washington and in
Saudi Arabia, announcing the number of combat flights, targets hit
and Iraqi troop movements. Things have changed. Even as President
Clinton's national security advisers flood the television airwaves
with back-to-back-to-back interviews to justify NATO's air campaign
against Yugoslavia, the American military has clammed up on the
most basic details of the operation. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-TUNNEL-FIRE PARIS _ French and Italian officials said
Friday that at least 35 people had died in a fire that erupted
Wednesday deep inside the Mont Blanc tunnel in the Alps. The blaze,
which began in a heavy truck and quickly engulfed some 30 other
vehicles, was finally brought under control Friday afternoon. By
Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   KEVORKIAN (Pontiac, Mich.) _ Assisted-suicide crusader Dr. Jack
Kevorkian was convicted Friday of second-degree murder for fatally
injecting a terminally ill man whose death was broadcast on
national television. (Summary from wires.) By Pam Belluck.
</P>
<P>
   POLICE-INDICT (New York) _ Developments in the wake of the
indictment of four police officers for the shooting of West African
immigrant Amadou Diallo. By Robert D. McFadden.

GAME CREATOR NOTCHES HIS FIRST FILM _ NOW WHAT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When game guru Chris Roberts was tapped to direct
a movie version of his ``Wing Commander'' series of videogames, a
few eyebrows arched.
</P>
<P>
   What, some wondered, was a gamer doing directing a big-time
(well, relatively speaking) film?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   At the film's premiere in Westwood recently, Roberts said it
wasn't a big jump for him to do a $25 million effects-laden
picture. After all, his last game, Wing Commander IV, had a $12
million budget, tons of full-motion video segments and a cast that
included Mark Hamill, Malcolm McDowell and John Rhys-Davies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the big difference: When I make a computer game, it's
longer and more drawn out, more interactive. And if something
doesn't work, I can go back and change it,'' Roberts said.
``Filmmaking is more cut and dried.''
</P>
<P>
   The storytelling is equally compact in a film compared to a
game, Roberts said. Wing Commander IV, for instance, normally gives
a player 20 to 30 hours of entertainment, compared to the 1{ to two
hours of most movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a much bigger canvas to work with'' in a game,
Roberts said. ``With film, you have two hours to nail it.''
</P>
<P>
   He did in a fun little film that makes for perfect summer fare
in any summer that doesn't have the next ``Star Wars'' film coming
out. That's why the movie was released in mid-March, in about 2,000
theaters nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   `It's World War II in space,'' Roberts said. ``It definitely has
an old-time war movie feel. I could have made it a lot more like
the Wing Commander game, but I made a conscious decision to make it
look different, to give it its own personality.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie opened modestly, with about $8.9 million in box-office
receipts in its first 10 days. Of course, it'll play not only in
the United States, but overseas and should have a long life in
video, so there's a good chance it'll make back its money and more.
</P>
<P>
   Having survived his first movie, Roberts would like to do
another, with a bigger budget, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically feel like I'm starting out with making movies,''
Roberts said. After ``taking everything I loved about movies and
(trying) to get it into games,'' he now wants to take what he's
learned in both game and film creation and make more films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a stack of scripts to read,'' Roberts said. ``I like
escapist fantasy things that take you to another world. I'm less
interested in doing another buddy cop movie.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; HALL OF FAMER
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of game gurus, Sid Meier has to be somewhere around the
top of any list of influential game designers of the past couple of
decades.
</P>
<P>
   And the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences recognized just
that when it announced this week that Meier would be the second
person inducted into its Hall of Fame. The ceremony will take place
during the first night of the Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3,
the massive game-industry convention returning to Los Angeles on
May 13.
</P>
<P>
   Meier is perhaps best-known for creating Civilization and
Civilization II, the magnificently balanced ``God'' games that let
players create and develop civilizations around the world,
investing in technology, commerce, infrastructure and military
while exploring the world around them.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, he released a space-based game of somewhat
similar proportions, the widely praised Alpha Centauri, and also
created Gettysburg and Railroad Tycoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's recognized as one of the true pioneers of interactive
gaming,'' said Glenn Entis, the academy's chairman of the board.
``This year it (picking a nominee) was a very easy decision,
looking at Sid's background and contributions to the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Meier grew up in Michigan and studied computer science at the
University of Michigan before moving to Baltimore for a computer
job. But in 1982, bitten with the gaming bug, he quit to co-found
MicroProse, where he wrote the first-ever flight simulator game,
F-15 Strike Eagle.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of that genre-starter, and of subsequent ones such
as Civilization and Railroad Tycoon, was a major reason for Meier's
induction, Entis said.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Meier left the now-giant MicroProse to create
Firaxis Games, where he could concentrate on his main interest _
writing games _ without worrying about the headaches of
distribution and marketing. Firaxis is based in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Meier said the secret to his many great games is his own
enjoyment of playing games, despite the fact that, at 45, he's too
old to have grown up playing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that comes through: that somebody who loves games put
these things together,'' Meier said. ``It wasn't some committee
that decided on this feature or that, or somebody who thought they
could just take a license (from some movie or TV show) and put
something together that might sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he chooses topics that have fascinated him for years,
and turns them into games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The games are just something I think were cool, like when I
was growing up and really liked trains,'' he said. ``I'm just
trying to capture the fun you thought was there.''
</P>
<P>
   His favorite recent games created by others include StarCraft,
SimCity 3000 and Diablo, he said. And playing them regularly with
his 8-year-old son helps keep him young.
</P>
<P>
   Meier started out writing tiny, floppy-based games that had
three-page manuals and were wrapped in plastic baggies. Now they're
shrink-wrapped boxes of CD-ROMS with extraordinary graphics and
sounds bringing complex simulations to life. But the business
hasn't changed that much, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a lot less different than you might think,'' Meier
said. ``The technology has come a long way, of course. I used to
write games (that would fit) in 64K (of computer memory). But
really, the core of a game has changed a lot less. You're still
trying to capture a gamer's imagination and make them the star of
the story, instead of just watching it.''
</P>
<P>
   The big technological changes in recent times have been limited,
Meier have been really been limited to two, Meier said. One was the
de facto standardization by gamers on the Windows-based PC as the
platform of choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started, we were writing on four or five platforms, and
it added a lot of overhead,'' Meier said. ``And ports (of a game
from one platform to another) are never as good as a game written
specifically for a platform. I think that's been a real positive
development for games.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Internet has created a near-instant feedback
loop between gamers and designers that quickly hones products.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we released Civilization, it was a month or two before we
got any feedback about how it was doing,'' Meier said. ``Today, you
send out a demo (on the Internet), and within two hours there's a
discussion thread (on the game's Web site) with 100 posts. That
really changes the way you put games together. You've got to have
quality in there; you can't just put the game out and hope it will
sell.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame nomination was a bit of a shock for Meier
because such honors often imply that a winner's best days may be
behind him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was certainly surprised,'' Meier said. ``I don't see myself
as winding down.''
</P>
<P>
   And no one should expect Meier to slow down, Entis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because our industry is so new, even our pioneers aren't close
to retirement,'' said Entis, the CEO of DreamWorks Interactive.
``Even though the Hall of Fame is based on past achievement, it
also means watch for things to come.''

`PLEASANTVILLE': IN LIVING COLOR ON DVD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It may pain the film purists, but sometimes
digital really can be the way to go in watching some movies.
Certainly, the folks over New Line Cinema would make a case for
that regarding the DVD version of ``Pleasantville,'' which will be
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The good-natured tale of '90s-era youths transported into a
black-and-white 1950s world used impressive special effects to
selectively color parts of the screen, as the transported youths
change the way the community thinks of itself and each other.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, said New Line vice president for post-production
Evan Edelist, ``the color really becomes a character in the
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating 1,700 special-effects shots involved a torturous
process that involved shooting the film in color, then converting
it back and forth between a digital version and film version a
couple of times, while stripping out all color and selectively
reintroducing it.
</P>
<P>
   The result smoothed out the transitions between color areas and
black-and-white ones, but is best seen in a digital format. Thus,
Edelist said, ``the DVD is the most representative of the vision of
director Gary Ross, the director of photography and the color
effects team.''
</P>
<P>
   The DVD version does look smashing, and the disc comes with a
ton of extras (beyond a really fine movie) that make the release
one of the more satisfying in recent times.
</P>
<P>
   Aong the features are an audio track featuring Ross' comments on
the film; another audio track featuring composer Randy Newman's
comments on his Oscar-nominated score; and a ``special effects film
school'' feature describing how some scenes were created.
</P>
<P>
   It also has the terrific Fiona Apple music video of ``Across the
Universe,'' created for the film by ``Boogie Nights'' director Paul
Thomas Andersen; a look at the two fat volumes of storyboards Ross
created in planning the film; and a visit to East L.A. muralist
Frank Romero's studio, where he discusses the mural he created for
the film.
</P>
<P>
   The disc also includes some computer-only features such as a
complete script, tied to storyboards, that can be printed or used
to jump through scenes in the film. A complete cast and crew list
links to the Internet Movie Database to provide always up-to-date
information about each participant.
</P>
<P>
   This is pleasant viewing indeed.

`BIRTH OF A BUTTERFLY': HARSH BEAUTY IN PARABLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
(DW) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mojtaba Raei's mystical meditation, ``Birth of a
Butterfly,'' was filmed in the mountains of northwestern Iran,
where the people's elemental relationship with nature is colored by
an intense spiritual faith. Consisting of three parables in which
that faith is tested, the movie suggests that Christianity and
Western culture have no monopoly on turning out religious kitsch.
Although ``Birth of a Butterfly'' is comparatively restrained and
tasteful as these things go, it imitates the Hollywood technique of
using gushy music to underscore moments of revelation.
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist of one parable is a shining-eyed teacher who
leaves civilization behind to trek through the wilderness and
instruct the children in a remote mountain village. Exuding a
charismatic radiance, he becomes an informal adviser to the
community. When one man who has lost a cow wonders where he can
find it, the teacher suggests he look in a certain field. Another
man is waiting for his son who disappeared a year ago to return.
The teacher counsels patience and says the son will soon come back.
</P>
<P>
   When both insights prove true, word spreads through the village
that the teacher is a prophet. When a flood threatens the
community, the villagers plead with him to intercede with God. Even
after the teacher insists he has no special powers, they refuse to
believe him and stalk off angrily.
</P>
<P>
   The miraculous upshot of the parable could just as well be
Christian as Islamic (in the entire movie there's no mention of
Allah), and can be summed up in one sentence: And the faith of a
child shall lead them.
</P>
<P>
   The other parables are not as clear-cut. In one, a man whose
wife is critically ill blames his innocent stepchildren. In
another, a young boy on a pilgrimage to a sacred spring whose
waters are supposed to cure all ills engages in a dialogue with an
old man he meets along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Birth of a Butterfly,'' which will be shown Saturday at 5:45
p.m. and Monday at 9 p.m. at the Museum of Modern Art as part of
New Directors/New Films, is best appreciated as a kind of visual
poem in which human beings are seen as intelligent wildlife
clinging to the rocks of a harshly beautiful natural landscape. The
faith the movie explores seems to spring naturally from an
environment where human life is so entirely at the mercy of the
elements that catastrophic events are assumed to have spiritual and
moral dimensions.
</P>

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In a victory for the United States and NATO on
Friday, the Security Council rejected, 12-3, a Russian resolution
demanding an immediate end to NATO's air attacks on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Voting in favor of the measure were two of its sponsors, Russia
and China, and Namibia. Voting against were the five council
members who are NATO members _ the United States, Britain, France,
Canada and the Netherlands _ together with Argentina, Bahrain,
Brazil, Gabon, Gambia, Malaysia and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
   While the resolution was almost certain to be defeated, the
scale of Russia's defeat surprised many diplomats and was described
by several as politically significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a landmark debate for the United Nations and an
enormous triumph for NATO and the United States,'' said Fernando
Enrique Petrella, Argentina's representative. ``A large majority of
nations have acted together to say that no longer will you be able
to violate human rights massively over a long period of time
without evoking a reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Petrella added that while the vote could not be described as a
U.N. endorsement of the NATO attacks, given the staunch opposition
of Russia and China, the council's overwhelming defeat of the
resolution could only bolster the ``legitimacy of what NATO is
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The vote was an admission that action was necessary,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sergey Lavrov, the Russian representative, refused to
acknowledge the defeat. Many of those who voted against his
resolution and with the United States were ``embarrassed'' to have
done so, he said, and had made this clear to him in private
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech seeking support for the resolution, which was also
sponsored by India and Belarus, Lavrov argued that the military
action was a ``flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter''
because it disregarded Yugoslavia's sovereignty. Those who favored
such action, he said, had placed themselves outside international
law, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's vote is not just on Kosovo, but on the Security
Council's role in the world community,'' Lavrov said. ``What is in
the balance now is law and lawlessness.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Burleigh, the American representative, said the allegation
that the military action violated the U.N. Charter ``turns the
truth on its head.''
</P>
<P>
   In at least two resolutions, he said, the Security Council had
specified what Yugoslavia must do to end the crisis. But rather
than agree to the political solution mediated by the so-called
Contact Group, whose six members include Russia, President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia had chosen to ``defy repeatedly the will of
the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   The charter, Burleigh said, ``does not sanction armed assaults
upon ethnic groups or imply that the international community should
turn a blind eye to a growing humanitarian disaster.'' A vote in
favor of the resolution, he warned, would ``only encourage
President Milosevic to continue or even to intensify military
repression of the civilian population of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by their votes and their speeches, the overwhelming
majority of Security Council members agreed with Burleigh's
argument that Yugoslavia, not NATO, had violated the charter and
international law by killing civilians and repressing the people of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Hasmy Agam, of Malaysia, which has occasionally been very
critical of American policy, said Yugoslavia's leadership bore
``full responsibility'' for the failure of the international
mediation efforts which, in turn, had prompted the need for
military action to protect the people of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the harshest attacks on the resolution's co-sponsors came
from Peter van Walsum, the recently appointed representative from
the Netherlands, a NATO member. While the Dutch were initially
``grateful'' to Russia for having contributed to the pressure that
the Contact Group brought on Yugoslavia, he said, ``at every
critical juncture'' since then, ``Russia has somehow succeeded in
making the pressure less credible, so that in the end NATO had no
choice but to make good on its threat'' to use force. The
alternative, he concluded, was ``to sit back and simply let the
humanitarian catastrophe occur.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lavrov's arguments were warmly endorsed by Belarus, India
and China.
</P>
<P>
   India's representative, Kamalesh Sharma, said that although the
resolution was overwhelmingly defeated by the council, the debate
suggested that nations representing ``half of humanity have said
they do not agree'' with the military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   China reiterated its position that Kosovo was an internal
Yugoslav concern. Qin Huason, Beijing's representative and current
president of the council, declared, ``We oppose power politics of
the strong bullying the weak.''
</P>
<P>
   This theme was echoed more aggressively by Yugoslavia's

and hatred against Serbians and Montenegrin people.'' (Serbia and

United Nations and its Security Council were ultimately ``savaged''
for not stopping the war in his country. Suppressing his ``moral
outrage'' over what he called the ``ethnic cleansing'' of his
country and now Kosovo, he said, he applauded the resolution's
rejection. ``Let us not allow the Security Council to be seen as
ineffectual as it was in Bosnia and Herzegovina for three and a
half years.''

BENING BACK ON STAGE WITH STEEL, FIRE IN `HEDDA GABLER' 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN WINN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Annette Bening has made a career of doing the
unexpected. She's doing it again in ``Hedda Gabler,'' with a steely
performance in Henrik Ibsen's 1890 tragedy that's about as far from
crowd-pleasing glamour as she could get. The show opened a
four-week run at the Geffen Playhouse this week.
</P>
<P>
   In the year's most hotly anticipated theatrical homecoming, the
film star and onetime ingenue at San Francisco's American
Conservatory Theater has met one of the theater's most difficult
and enigmatic roles with an interpretation every bit as unsolvable.
Bening's first stage appearance in a decade is not the triumph
publicity machines crave but a riddle at once fascinating and
strange.
</P>
<P>
   With her pensive stares, scalding sarcasm and nearly repellent
neck-straining tics, Bening encases Ibsen's unhappy bride in
fearsome isolation. Everything she does in Daniel Sullivan's
production _ a restless walk through the expanse of Riccardo
Hernandez's set, the defiant poses she strikes with her husband,
the patronizing manipulation of another woman _ seems preordained,
unwilled. It's as if Hedda were sleepwalking toward her doom.
</P>
<P>
   Only the truth startles her fully alive. ``I have a talent,''
she crescendoes, ``for boring myself to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Informed of a former lover's suicide, she declares it
``liberating'' with that lustrous Bening voice that can make a
single word sound orchestral. Then her voice tightens and her gaze
spirals inward again. ``I mean for (set ital)me,(end ital)'' she
adds. What this woman might ever do with her freedom remains a
mystery to her.
</P>
<P>
   Bening looks magnetic in her dark bodice-hugging gowns and
loosely coiffed hair. She can raise the stage temperature in an
instant with a smile calculated to kill _ shades of her menacing
screen heat in ``Valmont'' and ``The Grifters.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's nothing remotely charming or seductive about this
Hedda. If anything, Bening's performance borders on a kind of
tactical rigor that leaves the character's interior shrouded, to us
and even to Hedda herself.
</P>
<P>
   These aren't the sort of career-buffing choices Hollywood
actresses tend to make when they step from screen to stage. Bening
rejected a Noel Coward proposal for her Geffen engagement and
insisted on Ibsen instead. She commissioned a crisp new vernacular
adaptation, by ``The Substance of Fire'' playwright Jon Robin
Baitz. The cast includes Paul Guilfoyle, who appeared with Bening
in the recent psychological thriller ``In Dreams,'' as a snide
Judge Brack.
</P>
<P>
   Bening is billed above the title, but there's not a hint of star
turn in the show. Sullivan's staging is conventional, almost
ordinary. A brief thought of updating the action to the 1950s
vanished. Only the occasional colloquialism in the text _ one
couple decides not to ``see each other'' anymore _ marks this
``Hedda Gabler'' as something new.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Jennings, Bening's fellow ACT alumnus, plays Hedda's
spineless husband, Tesman. His voice is an apologetic purr to
Bening's sharp bark, and he barely registers her open taunts and
undisguised sarcasm. The imbalance is a problem. This sham marriage
seems too weightless to bind Hedda.
</P>
<P>
   Guilfoyle's smug Judge Brack and Patrick O'Connell's smoldering
Lovborg, Hedda's former lover and victim-in-waiting, open up
Bening's range more. Shooting out her window one morning, she fires
off a throaty laugh as well as a bullet in the judge's direction.
When she lures Lovborg to a downstage ottoman, Hedda's sexuality
comes on like a heat lamp. Pat Collins' lighting warms along with
them.
</P>
<P>
   Bening's long absence from the stage shows. She doesn't have the
unforced presence and fluid transitions she tossed off in ``Coastal
Disturbances'' in New York a decade ago. She poses a bit too much,
aping the portrait of Hedda's father, and relies on her grimaces
and far-off looks.
</P>
<P>
   But for anyone who remembers Bening's magnificent 1982-85 run at
ACT _ ``The Chalk Garden,'' ``The School for Wives,'' a glowing
``Arms and the Man'' with Jennings _ her return to the stage is
sweet. Her voice, now as it was then, is an amazingly supple
instrument, burrowing into the meaning and harshly beautiful music
of a line. Even in repose, Bening has always been irresistible to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   She's a different artist now, a different person, with more at
stake and more to tap. The life of a star and celebrity wife is
about as far from Hedda's curdled ambitions as a provincial 19th
century Norwegian town is from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bening is making a hard journey back to the place where she came
from and flourished, a classic drama in a regional playhouse. It's
not a headline grabber. And that, finally, may be the best news of
all about this unflashy ``Hedda Gabler.'' Bening has come out of
the glare, at least for a month, and back home to the life of the
theater.

   CALTRANS HONORS CHAVEZ WITH GIFT OF SIGNS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Robert Cromey &LR; , rector of San Francisco's Trinity Episcopal
Church, isn't usually an impatient man, but he was wondering last
week, four years after the Board of Supervisors renamed Army
Street, and despite the recent induction of  &UR; Cesar Chavez &LR;  into the
Department of Labor's Hall of Fame, why there's still no freeway
sign directing drivers to Cesar Chavez Street.
</P>
<P>
   Cromey's query was well-timed. This week, said Caltrans' &UR; Greg &LR; 
 &UR; Bayol &LR; , in keeping with the United Farm Workers' celebration of
Chavez's birthday on March 31, two new signs directing drivers on
Highway 101 to Cesar Chavez Street will be unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   They're not big signs, Bayol said, because so far the city
hasn't been willing to foot the bill to replace the big overhead
freeway signs, estimated at $900,000 a few years ago just after the
name was changed. If the street name were shorter, Bayol said, and
the signs could be fixed rather than replaced, the bill would be
only $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Caltrans realizes, says Bayol, that shortening the name might be
a delicate issue; at the same time Caltrans knows that people are
getting lost. While the city figures out how to pay the bill, the
two new signs provide Chavez with a posthumous birthday gift that
duplicates the gift he always had: an unfailing sense of direction.

   KOSOVO-RDP (Washington) _ As NATO forces stepped up their
bombing assault into the daylight hours, President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia maintained fierce resistance both on the
ground and in the air. Two of his MIG-29 fighters shot down on what
NATO claimed was a foray into neighboring Bosnia. The sweep by Serb
troops through the ethnic Albanian villages of Kosovo continued
unabated, NATO said, despite the third straight day of air assaults
that NATO officials emphasized would be unrelenting until Milosevic
accepted peace. By Francis X. Clines and Steven Lee Myers.

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The allied military strategy for stopping
Serbian attacks against ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo rests
largely on the hope that Serbian military commanders will seek an
end to the intense NATO bombing before it destroys their army and
air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The hope, allied officers and diplomats say, is that the strikes
that began Wednesday will cause so much damage that the Serbian
high commanders will pressure President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia to back down and accept allied terms before the military
loses everything.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what basis there was for such a hope, one senior NATO
diplomat said, ``There have been signs that the army was reluctant
to get involved in Kosovo, and that it was forced by Milosevic to
engage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His strategy is retaining power,'' the official said. ``The
longer NATO action continues, the more he is in danger of losing
his grip.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Balkans have often demonstrated a logic of their own.
From Milosevic's point of view, there may be good reason to hope
that the longer the bombing continues, the greater the chance that
fissures will develop within the alliance _ a hope that may be as
illusory as NATO's own hope about dissension in the Serb ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently, Milosevic moved to strengthen his control over
the army and security forces, replacing the army's longtime
commander last October and the chief of his internal security
forces just before the start of the most recent offensive in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And in Serbia, according to the Western reporters who were
expelled from Belgrade this week, Milosevic's popularity seems to
be soaring, not plummeting, as Serbs rally around him in defiance
of the allied bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the allies are counting on the intensity of the
bombing to convince Milosevic that his best course is to call off
his operations in Kosovo. On Friday, alliance officials said,
Yugoslavia lost two more of its supersonic MiG-29 fighter-bombers.
It had 15 of the MiGs at the start of the bombing, and lost three
in earlier dogfights.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance spokesman, Jamie P. Shea, said the planes had flown
to Bosnia on Friday with the apparent intention of attacking the
NATO peacekeeping force there. Allied planes shot them down, and
allied troops were searching for the two pilots, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be in a situation where eventually it will become
clear to the leadership that the price of this campaign is too
high,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the peace agreement that the Serbs refused to sign in
France a week ago will still be on the table if it takes weeks to
bring Milosevic around is unclear. ``If we said we would continue
bombing Milosevic until he signs the Rambouillet agreement, we
could be bombing for years,'' one diplomat said.

 BRUSSELS, Belgium: diplomat said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bombing continued for a third day after allied warplanes
attacked more than 50 targets during the first two days, military
commanders said. According to the allied command, almost all those
sites were either command centers for the Yugoslav army, internal
security police who have been rounding up suspected rebels and
burning Albanians out of their homes in Kosovo, or air-defense
radar, missile and anti-aircraft sites the allies need to eliminate
before they can do anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Clearing out the anti-aircraft batteries should take a few more
days, officials said. At that point, there would probably be a
pause while NATO Secretary General Javier Solana consults with
allied leaders to see whether they still agreed that allied
warplanes should start going directly at the tank bases, arms
arsenals, fuel depots and artillery bases that the army and
interior ministry police forces in Kosovo have been using in their
campaign against the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But even Gen. Wesley Clark, the American top commander of
``Operation Allied Force,'' said Friday that there was no way the
bombing, however long it lasted and however intense it was, could
stop all Serb assaults against civilians on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always understood from the outset that there was no way
we were going to stop these paramilitary forces from going into
these villages and attacking,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   But allied attacks against those forces and their
infrastructure, Clark and other officials said, would leave Serb
forces much less capable of carrying out big sweeps like the ones
that have sent tens of thousands more ethnic Albanians fleeing for
their lives in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Milosevic does back down, that kind of bombing could go
on for weeks or months, with periodic air attacks against Serb
mobile anti-aircraft guns and missile sites when they turned on
their radars and threatened allied planes much like the pinprick
war of attrition the forces Clark commands in Turkey have been
waging against air defenses in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The European allies, according to some of their representatives
here, are just as prepared as the United States is to see the
bombing continue for many days, if not weeks, if it takes that long
to get Yugoslavia's leader to back down.
</P>
<P>
   But their resolve might not survive the pressure that would come
if allied planes were shot down and pilots were taken prisoner, or
if misfired allied bombs caused heavy civilian casualties in
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in NATO would like to see the bombing stop as soon
as possible,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Greece is probably the NATO ally with the most reservations
about the attacks. But even Italy, the country from which most of
the 400 allied missions have been launched against Serbia, would
like to take advantage of a pause in the bombing to get diplomatic
efforts restarted, Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   According to diplomats from several European countries, no
allied ambassadors here have dissented from the consensus
supporting the bombing. The 19 countries in the alliance, Solana
said, were as one, at least in daily meetings of its North Atlantic
Council here, in support for continuing the bombing in the hope it
would lead Milosevic to back down and end the violence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As for an exit strategy for the allies, the sooner he backs down
the better for them, because the longer the bombing continues, the
harder they believe it will be to revive the peace negotiations and
send a NATO-led international military force into Kosovo to police
the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Another question is whether the allies, who have insisted so far
that they have no intention of becoming the air force for the
Kosovo Liberation Army, would consider providing support for the
rebels if the Serbs did not back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this goes on, we may have to reassess some aspects of our
basic policy but we are still a long way from that,'' a senior
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for the rebels signed the peace accord in Paris on
March 18 under which Kosovo and its ethnic Albanian majority would
regain their autonomy within Yugoslavia, and an international
peacekeeping force would be deployed in the province. But the
Serbian leader, like many of his compatriots, believes Kosovo is
sacred Serbian ground, on which Orthodox Christian Serbs fell as
martyrs to Islamic Turk invaders five centuries ago, and has
rejected any international military presence.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has also told Western mediators that he believes the
proposed peace agreement and the peacekeepers would just provide
international cover for the secession of the province, with a
referendum on independence at the end of a three-year transition
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic cannot destroy the Kosovo Liberation Army with the
military option,'' a senior official said. It remains to be seen
whether NATO's military option can end Milosevic's defiance.

NATO PLANES DOWN TWO YUGOSLAV MiG-29s 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a dramatic, daytime escalation of the Balkan
fighting, NATO said Friday its warplanes shot down two Yugoslav
MiG-29s that were apparently readying a raid on Western
peacekeepers in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said U.S. F-15Cs fired on the
Russian-built jets when it was clear they were entering the no-fly
zone over Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Initially NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said the MiG pilots
parachuted from the crippled planes, were captured and would be
held by allied forces until the end of the Kosovo engagement, which
entered its third day Friday. Bacon said he could not confirm the
capture: ``We do not have the pilots. We don't know if the pilots
are alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic denied the NATO
claim of shooting down the MiGs, but wire services reported
sightings of planes crashing about five miles inside Bosnia near
the town of Bijeljina. CNN showed wreckage of what it said was one
of the Yugoslav planes.
</P>
<P>
   Following two nights of aerial bombardment, NATO started the
daylight action by firing a cruise missile from the USS Philippine
Sea in the Adriatic. After dark, more missiles and bombs hammered
Yugoslav military targets in what Bacon called a ``large'' assault
from an aerial array that included B-52s and F-117 stealth
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Targets on the third night of attacks included installations
closer to the center of Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, according
to wire service and broadcast reports. And there were signs the
target list was widening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are gradually increasing the emphasis on attacking targets
in Kosovo itself,'' Bacon said, including the Serb special police
associated with growing reports of atrocities against ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clinton administration continued to say that it did
not plan to use ground troops in the assault, national security
adviser Samuel Berger told NBC News: ``One can never anticipate all
possibilities in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced 100 combat-ready U.S. Marines were
being sent to Skopje, Macedonia, to protect the embassy, which
anti-American demonstrators attacked Thursday. Skopje, the
Macedonian capital, is less than 50 miles from the border of the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   No progress was reported on the diplomatic front. The U.N.
Security Council rejected a Russian resolution calling for an
immediate end to the NATO military drive. President Clinton and his
European allies are seeking to force Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to stop fighting with ethnic Albanians in the province of
Kosovo and to allow western troops to police the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials said the violence by Milosevic's forces
against Kosovar Albanians had increased. NATO's deputy military
chief, Air Commodore David Wilby of Britain's Royal Air Force, said
Milosevic's police had released ``300 hard-line Serbian prisoners''
to join paramilitary troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav MiG sortie over Bosnia-Herzegovina, an independent
republic formerly part of Yugoslavia, marked a potentially
dangerous step up in the response by the Milosevic regime.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon called the MiG flight into Bosnia ``a serious challenge,
and so far a challenge that we've been able to repel.''
</P>
<P>
   If the aim was to draw NATO planes over Yugoslavia and make them
better targets, Bacon said, ``it backfired egregiously on the
Yugoslavs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said that the downing of the two MiG-29s on Friday and the
destruction of three others as the NATO attacks began Wednesday
meant that Yugoslavia had lost a third of its top-of-the-line
warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The first two nights of NATO air strikes saw little active
defense from the Belgrade government, especially from Yugoslavia's
well-regarded air-defense system.
</P>
<P>
   NATO forces are in Bosnia to police the 1995 U.S.-sponsored
agreement that ended fighting there between Muslims and Serbs, most
of whom are orthodox Christians and were supported by Milosevic and
his military. The NATO contingent in Bosnia _ the so-called
``stabilization force'' or ``SFOR'' _ numbers 30,000, of which
6,700 are U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Bosnian deal, known as the Dayton accords,
Yugoslav military aircraft are prohibited overflight.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav MiGs were intercepted by NATO planes from Operation
Deny Flight, which operates primarily from some of the same
airbases in Italy that are mounting the aerial assault on
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright expressed satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are satisfied with the way that the air campaign is
going,'' Albright said in a CNN interview. ``Nobody expected that
there would be a turnaround in five minutes or 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize the administration view that the United States is
in the NATO operation for the long haul, Clinton did not make a
public statement Friday _ except a taped appearance that was beamed
to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking through a translator who read the president's
remarks in Serbo-Croatian, said Milosevic had condemned Yugoslav
``sons to keep fighting a senseless conflict that you did not ask
for and that he could have prevented.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright delivered a similar radio message, reading it in
Serbo-Croatian she learned as a girl when her father was a Czech
diplomat in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not going to be one knockout blow, but day after day,
if he does not stop his genocidal attacks on the Kosovo people, we
will take larger and larger lumps out of his military force,''
British Defense Secretary George Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Until the reported appearance of the MiGs over Bosnia, military
officials at NATO and the Department of Defense had been somewhat
puzzled by the lack of response from Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of Yugoslavia's mobile SA-6 surface-to-air missiles had
been fired in the engagement, and it did not hit a NATO target.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps it's an indication of the success of our operations,
or a husbanding of resources,'' British Air Commodore Wilby said.
Some defense analysts have suggested the Yugoslavs are waiting
until NATO sends in slower and lower-flying planes before
activating more of its air-defense system.
</P>
<P>
   In its current stage, Wilby said, the operation is ``very
systematically taking out the meat of the (air) defense systems.''
And NATO spokesman Shea said, ``We have to be in a situation where
we have taken out sufficient air defense assets so that our pilots
can operate with a relatively greater degree of safety in Yugoslav
air space.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilby said in the first two nights NATO conducted about 400
sorties against 50 targets. Pentagon sources said about half were
flown by U.S. crews.

<P>
   JAZINCE, Macedonia _ On a rocky hill overlooking the village in
Kosovo 20 yards across the border that he fled last week, Agim, 27,
squinted through binoculars at two Serbian armored vehicles parked
in the middle of his town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen soldiers looting televisions and refrigerators,'' he
reported. ``They chased us all away, and now they are stealing
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Such furtive glances through binoculars are what pass for
monitoring of the situation in Kosovo these days. International
monitors pulled out just before NATO began bombing, foreign aid
workers left or seem to be under house arrest and the last foreign
journalists were expelled Thursday.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For now at least, the world is relying on rushed and emotional
accounts by the few refugees who are able to sneak or bribe their
way through Serbian roadblocks, and scratchy mobile-phone calls
from ethnic Albanians trapped inside their homes in Kosovo, the
southernmost province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The descriptions of Serbian reprisals against Albanians since
the bombings began range from harassment and property damage to the
killings of civilians. But in one of the worst crises Europe has
faced since World War II, information about what is really
happening is sketchy and unverifiable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``With reporters out and aid workers grounded, there really
isn't very much we can do,'' said Fernando del Mundo, an aid worker
with the United Nations High Commission on Refugees. He had worked
in Kosovo for eight months until he was evacuated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not to say that atrocities are not happening,'' he
added. ``I'm sure a lot of it is, but we have no means to confirm
it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friday the refugee commission reported from its headquarters in
Geneva that it had received information from 174 Albanian Kosovars
who fled to northern Albania that there had been a massacre in
Goden, their village.
</P>
<P>
   According to the refugees, Serbian police came into the village,
set houses and the school on fire and shot 20 men, then marched the
174 villagers to the border and expelled them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot confirm it,'' del Mundo said. ``That's just what
they told us. Some is probably true, but different people have
different ways of telling their stories.''
</P>
<P>
   There have also been news reports, based on a statement by the
separatist guerrilla group that calls itself the Kosovo Liberation
Army, that 20,000 ethnic Albanians were rounded up from Cirez, near
a Serbian munitions factory, to serve as human shields to deter
NATO bombings. No reporters or aid workers have been able to
confirm it, and del Mundo described the figure of 20,000 as
ludicrous, if only because Cirez only has 5,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Yugoslav government of President Slobodan Milosevic,
which expelled all foreign journalists from Belgrade on Wednesday,
is only letting out information that serves its own purposes,
ethnic Albanians want to put his regime in the worst possible
light. Finding the truth in between has become almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,400 monitors for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, who left Kosovo before the bombing, are in
hotels in Skopje and Ohrid, a Macedonian town to the south, with no
real means of gathering reliable information. The organization
plans to send most of them home, keeping a core of 250 monitors in
Macedonia to prepare for a possible return to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, William Walker, the American who directs the monitors,
told reporters that the situation in Kosovo was deteriorating, but
his staff members say they cannot really determine how far. They
must rely on rumors and sketchy accounts provided by local
employees left behind in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But those people, like local employees of international aid
organizations, are at risk, and communicating with western agencies
outside only increases it. ``Do you really want to put people's
lives in danger just to find out what might be happening?'' said
Urdur Gunnersdottir, a spokeswoman for the monitors.
</P>
<P>
   International aid workers and journalists have sought refuge in
Macedonia, but it has not turned out to be so reassuring a haven
for U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   When pro-Serbia demonstrators rioted outside the U.S. Embassy in
Skopje on Thursday, setting vehicles on fire, smashing windows and
pulling down gates, Macedonian riot police only belatedly dispersed
the crowd. U.S. soldiers assigned to the United Nations operation
in Macedonia, whose mandate expired in February, were called in to
secure the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   During the disturbance, Ambassador Christopher Hill and 40 other
embassy employees sought refuge in a bunker inside the compound,
communicating with the State Department and the Macedonian police
by cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the U.S. soldiers were replaced with an armored vehicle
equipped with a cannon and a cordon of armed U.S. marines, who
stood guard behind a newly placed barrier of barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department announced that all nonessential personnel
and their families would be allowed to leave Macedonia for their
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Hill issued a statement saying the riot was ``caused by an
organized mob whose goal was to cause damage and increase anxiety
during these uneasy times.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, whose hotel was also surrounded by hundreds of
demonstrators who attempted to burn the Kosovo monitors' vehicles,
blamed the attacks on Milosevic. Calling the riots ``well-organized
and planned,'' Walker said his monitors had received information
weeks ago that Serbia planned ``as much trouble as Milosovic could
stir up.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian police said Friday that 60 demonstrators had been
arrested, including Dragisha Miletic, leader of the Democratic Serb
Party, an ethnic Serbian political group in Macedonia. He was later
released, The Associated Press reported, and a demonstration
planned for Friday was canceled.

 &HT;    Seminar aims to create black investors
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A conference today is aimed at encouraging
African-Americans to spend less and to save more.
</P>
<P>
   The sessions, sponsored by the 5,000-member Coalition of Black
Investors, offer advice on stocks, mutual funds, 401(k) plans, IRAs
and taxes, as well as talks by former Atlanta Mayor Maynard
Jackson, television personality Tavis Smiley and the Rev. Jesse
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``This organization exists to turn more African-American
consumers into investors,'' said COBI President Carol Davis, who
founded the group in 1997 with her husband, a financial adviser
with First Union Brokerage Services. ``We are just trying to help
people be more aware of the things they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Black people represent about 14 percent of the nation's
population, but only 7 percent of the income. And while many black
people have moved into professional jobs, affluent blacks are not
necessarily as secure as their incomes might indicate.
</P>
<P>
   According to Northeastern University Professor Thomas Shapiro,
co-author of ``Black Wealth/White Wealth,'' a typical black family
averages 11 percent of the wealth of a white family. Among the
middle class, the figure improves to only 25 percent, Shapiro
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said a key reason that blacks account for just 3 percent
of the nation's wealth is a lack of investments. But it is not just
a matter of money, Davis said: Black people have $500 billion a
year in buying power, but instead of investing, they have responded
far too well to the barrage of enticements to buy.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1998 study by Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., black
households have an average of $117,000 saved or invested, compared
with $224,000 for whites.
</P>
<P>
   One handicap is the lack of inherited wealth, the kind of
affluence that is fueling the transfer of an estimated $6 trillion
in wealth into the hands of baby boomers during the next several
decades. Only a tiny fraction of that money will come to black
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if not for you, but for the next generation, we want to
break this vicious cycle,'' Davis said. ``It's not rocket science.
It's as easy as having an automatic debit for your checking
account.''
</P>
<P>
   Registration for the conference, at the Renaissance Waverly
Hotel, begins at 7:30 a.m. and costs $99. A separate session
focused on the leadership role of the church starts at 8:45 a.m.

 &HT;    Small Business agency to hold Y2K seminar
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Your company's computer has passed the Y2K checkup,
but what about the copy and credit card machines and the elevator?
Are the accounting and delivery services you use up to par
Y2K-wise?
</P>
<P>
   At most Fortune 500 companies, a Y2K team takes care of these
concerns. For most small business owners, the job probably falls to
the owner or a relative.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a disturbing thought for the federal and state Small
Business Administration, as many of Georgia's 265,000 small
businesses are just beginning to deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K is a business and management issue, not just a technology
issue,'' said Fred Hochberg, who helped build and run his family's
catalog company, Lillian Vernon Corp., before becoming the
second-in-command at the federal agency in May. ``Y2K is a problem
we can address. No business should be hurt by Y2K if they take
prudent and proper precautions.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency will hold a nuts-and-bolts workshop Tuesday in
Atlanta during Y2K Action Week. It is the largest Y2K conference in
the Southeast and is expected to draw 200 to 250 people. Hochberg
will speak at the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of information, conferences and seminars to
make small businesses aware,'' said Charles Anderson, Georgia's SBA
director. ``This is a conference to give small firms the
information they need to fix the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Disaster experts Julie Freestone and Rudi Raab suggest companies
look at everything from how their employees will get paid if banks
are unable to operate to where critical materials and equipment
will come from if suppliers are paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Freestone and Raab, authors of the book ``Disaster Preparedness:
Simple Steps for Businesses,'' says the Y2K problem could force
companies to create disaster plans.
</P>
<P>
   The workshop will help companies learn how to test their
computer equipment, figure out if they need to call outside help
and where to get it, help pick a consultant and set up contingency
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The workshop is 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. at the Georgia Public
Broadcasting Center, 260 14th St. For details and to register, call
(888) 248-5681 or go online to www.222.sba.gov/y2k.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A warm laugh rises from the audience when, in the
finale of ``Ziegfeld Follies of 1936,'' Howard McGillin steps
forward and sings: ``We're not explaining the plot/You cannot
explain what's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Ira Gershwin's sharp lyric aptly gives a kind of shape to this
effervescent, attenuated mishmash of a revue, revived by the
Encores musicals-in-concert series and running through Monday at
City Center. A list of what this period showcase is not could, in
fact, fill pages. It is not, for instance, uproariously funny,
gloriously tuneful or drenched in glamour. But all of this one
might have anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Tailored as a Depression-era star vehicle to the specific
talents of, among others, Fanny Brice, Bob Hope, Eve Arden and
Josephine Baker, the 1936 edition of Flo Ziegfeld's long-running
variety show was as much a perishable product of its time as an
installment of David Letterman or Conan O'Brien is sure to seem 63
years from today.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was a swell idea by Encores to bring back the Ziegfeld
Follies. Despite a dearth of the intoxicating highs one has come to
expect from this exquisitely produced concert series of old
musicals, Mark Waldrop's production of the songs by Vernon Duke and
Gershwin and sketches by Gershwin and David Freedman represents a
fascinating evening of time travel. Thanks to newsreels, movies and
musicals like ``Funny Girl,'' not to mention Stephen Sondheim's
``Follies,'' which transformed iconic aging versions of the
showgirls into metaphors for an increasingly cynical nation,
theatergoers have an inkling of what the Follies were like.
</P>
<P>
   But to appreciate the impact of the Ziegfeld style more fully _
its influence can be sensed today in everything from television
sketch comedy to music videos _ there is no substitute for the kind
of warts-and-all immersion that Encores provides.
</P>
<P>
   Waldrop, whose expertise in the revue genre was confirmed with
his direction of the camp Off Broadway hit ``When Pigs Fly,'' was a
smart choice for this venture, which opened on Thursday night.
Wisely, he does not brook any camping it up, even in the worst of
the sketches, some of which seemed creaky to critics in January
1936 when the show opened at the Winter Garden Theater. One
empathizes completely with the uphill battle waged all evening by
Mary Testa and Peter Scolari, filling the roles played in the
original by Brice and Hope; they have the roughest assignments,
performing skit after hackneyed skit about nutty psychiatrists, fey
bluebloods and even in a flat Hollywood parody featuring Brice's
trademark comic creation, Baby Snooks.
</P>
<P>
   In the totally unpredictable manner of a Broadway revue, a show
in which the plot is absolutely ``not,'' the moments of endearment
arrive with all of the serendipity of a singing telegram. When, for
instance, Karen Ziemba appears with Bob Walton and Jim Walton early
in the proceedings for ``My Red-Letter Day,'' a buoyant ditty in
three-part harmony, this terrific trio catches the audience off
guard with its brio and polish and swinging segue into tap.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthie Henshall, the creamy-voiced London musical actress making
a smashing New York debut, has similar success with ``Words Without
Music,'' a torchy number with dancing by Jonathan Sharp and the New
York City Ballet soloists Jock Soto and Jenifer Ringer. Scolari and
the versatile Christine Ebersole, an enchantment in skit and song
alike as the Eve Arden character, do very nicely by Gershwin's
sprightly ``I Can't Get Started.''
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of its mandate, Encores does not trade in excessive
opulence _ the tasteful visual touches are confined to Art Deco
chandeliers and a lovely back curtain of translucent dangling
strands _ which is at variance with everything lavishly
Ziegfeldian. (In the clever opening number, McGillin, promising
that ``the day of the girlie-girlie show is through,'' immediately
makes way for a procession of leggy showgirls in jeweled
headdresses.) The lighting designer Peter Kaczorowski jazzes up the
visuals with his accustomed wizardry, but in this production it is
chiefly the job of the choreographer, Thommie Walsh, to create the
sense of spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ziegfeld Follies of 1936'' gives him multiple opportunities to
accomplish this _ the revue has so much dancing that Scolari gets
the laugh line ``Yeah, I know what you're thinking: the show needs
another dream ballet'' _ and Walsh pulls many of them off with
style to spare.
</P>
<P>
   The sexiest number is ``Island in the West Indies,'' later to
become a Bobby Short standard. It's sung here by Ms. Ebersole and
danced, MGM movie style, as a splashy, shoulder-bouncing
jungle-fever extravaganza. ``The Gazooka,'' the parodistic Act I
finale, has a witty introduction, mocking the hype of period movie
trailers, but the number itself is a letdown.
</P>
<P>
   The only occupant of the bottom of the barrel is ``Night
Flight,'' an oddly wan tribute to aviation: this is 1936, after
all. As danced by Ms. Ringer, it looks a bit like a follow-up to
the loopy interpretive film-score dancing on Sunday night's Academy
Awards show.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Baker, portrayed here by Stephanie Pope, came under
attack at the time for what was described in some reviews as her
wooden contribution to this Follies, but the material may have been
to blame; it is hard to imagine she could have done much more with
``5 a.m.,'' a limply sultry song, than the undulations Ms. Pope can
manage. No one suffers the vitamin deficiencies in the writing more
poignantly than the show's lesser comics, played by Kevin
Chamberlin and Stanley Bojarski, naturally funny actors who here
never stand a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ziegfeld Follies of 1936'' is by no means one of Encores'
greatest hits, but it does help to place in perspective some others
among its recent offerings; deeply flawed shows like ``DuBarry Was
a Lady'' and ``Babes in Arms,'' by comparison, almost qualify as
fully integrated book musicals.
</P>
<P>
   The Follies, through dozens of incarnations in the early part of
the century, were of course never meant to resemble anything close
to that. But that doesn't diminish their significance. What
Waldrop's faithful staging reminds us of is the exalted stage
Broadway once represented as the premier, star-studded pedestal for
American show business, where the talents loomed so large it hardly
mattered if there was a plot, or not.

BUSH, CORNYN URGE COURT TO OVERTURN PRAYER BAN AT TEXAS FOOTBALL
GAMES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Attorney General John Cornyn and Gov.
George W. Bush jumped into a dispute over prayer in public schools
Friday, asking a federal appellate court to reconsider a decision
banning prayers at high school football games.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, joined by Bush, filed a brief supporting the Santa Fe
Independent School District's efforts to continue its practice of
allowing student-led prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the First Amendment rights of students to gather and
participate in protected religious speech,'' Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Griffin, a Galveston attorney who represents the
unidentified plaintiffs in the case, said Cornyn and Bush's
decision to intervene ``shows how sacred football is in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The school district has asked the full 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in New Orleans to review a three-judge panel's Feb. 26
decision that forbids prayer at football games but allows it at
high school graduation ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn and Bush, along with the school district, want prayer
allowed in both places.
</P>
<P>
   In its 2-1 decision, the court noted a previous ruling that
prayer is appropriate at such solemn events as graduation but that
football games are ``hardly the sober type of annual event that can
be appropriately solemnized with prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges ruled that prayer at graduation could be allowed as
long as it is non-sectarian and non-proselytizing.
</P>
<P>
   But Cornyn says that ruling puts the state in the middle of the
issue, because Texas public school officials would have to review
the prayer to make sure it is non-sectarian and that it doesn't try
to convert someone to a particular religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The panel's decision asks the state to decide what type of
prayer should be allowed. To ask the state to supervise religious
speech is clearly unconstitutional,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He contends that the Santa Fe school district's policies for
graduation and football-game prayers meet constitutional
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``These policies ensure that the schools remain neutral while
allowing for student-initiated speech. The purpose behind the
policy is not to advance religion, but that of promoting
solemnization and good sportsmanship,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Griffin said that practitioners of minor religions would be
placed in a ``very precarious position'' if students were allowed
to decide the content of graduation ceremony prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be majority rule every time, and that means
Christian prayers in Texas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin represents two families _ one Roman Catholic and one
Mormon _ with children in the district. The families, who remain
anonymous because they feared retaliation, filed suit five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Fe school district policy allows a graduating class to
choose by secret ballot whether to have an invocation and
benediction as part of its graduation ceremony. Before the court
ruling, students could similarly elect to have a brief invocation
during the pre-game ceremonies before home varsity football games.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court panel held that even student-initiated prayers
are never permissible at school-sponsored football games.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unheard of for a governor to join a legal brief,
although filing such documents is the responsibility of the
attorney general, the state's chief lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn took the lead in preparing the school prayer brief, and
Bush added his name to it.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin said Bush's anticipated presidential race may have
affected the governor's decision. Support for school prayer is
strong among conservative Republicans, who will have an important
role in nominating their party's next presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Must be close to 2000,'' Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said the governor ``supports the
rights of students to participate in the free exercise of religion,
a right that is guaranteed by the Constitution, and he believes the
government should not dictate or censor the content of student-led
prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty Legal Institute, a Plano, Texas-based organization
specializing in the defense of religious freedom and First
Amendment rights, also asked the 5th Circuit to overturn the Santa
Fe decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision will require open government bigotry against
religious students if it is not overturned,'' said Kelly
Shackelford, a lawyer for the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Graduation students may pray, but not in the name of Jesus or
anything specific. Prayers that are unacceptable to the government
will be eradicated.''

ANALYSIS: FOR GOP BUDGET, THE EASY PART IS OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republican leaders took care of the
easy part of this year's budget battle in passing their tax and
spending plan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   By managing to hold their fractious caucus together and dampen
rivalries between the party's leaders in the House and Senate,
Republicans managed to lay out a cohesive agenda built around a
sweeping tax cut, fiscal austerity, a strong military and smaller
government.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the budget resolutions in the two chambers sets up a
clean debate with Democrats and President Clinton. Republicans say
the overriding priorities as the nation decides how to divide
anticipated budget surpluses should be shoring up Social Security
and returning as much money as possible to taxpayers, with more
money carved out as well for the Pentagon and education.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats agree that Social Security should top the list, but
say the remainder of the projected windfall should be apportioned
among Medicare, spending on a broad range of domestic programs and
tax cuts for low and middle income people.
</P>
<P>
   But the process of turning the Republican budget guideline into
tax and spending legislation that can pass Congress and be signed
into law by Clinton promises to be messy, contentious and slow.
Making it even more difficult are the looming problems in Social
Security and Medicare, which are casting a long shadow over the
budget debate and seem increasingly unlikely to be resolved this
year.
</P>
<P>
   If there has been any clear message this year, it is the
enduring power of Social Security to shape the policies and
politics of both parties. Where the deficit once constrained
Republican tax-cutting efforts and forced Democrats to limit their
calls for new spending, each party's fear of being accused by the
other of raiding Social Security money has created an unlikely but
far-reaching consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties now agree that the bulk of the surplus, roughly
$1.8 trillion out of $2.6 trillion over the next decade, should not
be used for spending or tax cuts. Rather, they say, it should be
used only to help Social Security, either indirectly by reducing
the national debt, or directly by financing a Republican-backed
plan to create private investment accounts within the retirement
system.
</P>
<P>
   That $1.8 trillion represents the portion of the surplus
generated by Social Security payroll taxes in excess of what is
needed to pay benefits over the next decade. Although successive
Congresses and administrations have dipped into the Social Security
surplus for years to finance general government operations, that
pool of money has quickly become so sacrosanct that the two parties
are arguing about who can do more to wall it off from the rest of
the budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument that we should not use Social Security taxes for
anything else has turned out to be far more compelling than most
folks anticipated,'' said Carol Cox Wait, president of the
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog
group.
</P>
<P>
   Because so much of the surplus is now agreed to be untouchable,
the fight over what is left is that much more intense.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways it will be a nuts and bolts legislative fight, with
lawmakers of both parties trying to win money for what they
consider pressing needs. To hold House Republicans together in the
budget vote Thursday, Speaker Dennis Hastert had to mollify the
powerful chairman of the Transportation Committee, Rep. Bud
Shuster, R-Pa., by promising more money for airport expansions and
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, a bipartisan majority agreed at the last minute
to increase financing for child care. In both chambers, legislators
made pleas for more aid for hard-pressed farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The willingness of Republicans to stand by their pledges of
fiscal austerity will not be truly tested until this summer, when
they vote on appropriations bills that will have to slash many
domestic programs to remain within tight spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   Then Republicans will face the challenge of negotiating with
Clinton to get their tax and spending bills signed into law. The
President has proved skillful in outmaneuvering Republicans in the
budget endgame in recent years, not only achieving enough of his
goals to claim victory but also leaving Republicans at each other's
throats.
</P>
<P>
   In a memorandum sent Friday to the Republican leadership, two
influential conservatives, Stephen Moore of the Cato Institute and
Lawrence Kudlow, a supply-side economist, said the party could face
a meltdown if it mishandled the budget this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The GOP must at all costs avoid last year's fiscal collapse,
when Congress agreed to enormous election-eve spending bills, and
tax cuts were scuttled altogether,'' the memorandum said.
``Repeating those mistakes later this year will so dispirit the
conservative pro-growth wing of the GOP that the party will risk
losing everything in November of 2000: the House, the Senate and
the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore and Kudlow would not have been heartened by a statement
made by Hastert on Friday during an online chat with students.
Asked what kind of tax cut Republicans would pursue with the $15
billion they anticipate will be available for that purpose next
year, Hastert responded that he was not sure how much would be left
once the spending bills were completed.

`WEST BEIRUT': COMING OF AGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Lebanon)   (Eds: Production notes at end of review.)  
(DW) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With an eye for affectingly quotidian detail, Ziad Doueiri makes
``West Beirut'' a largely autobiographical account of war brewing
in his native Lebanon, circa 1975. ``During the first years of the
civil war, despite the anxiety that I could sense in my parents, I
was incapable of feeling it myself,'' he has said about the events
described here. ``I wasn't born with fear; I acquired it.'' His
film described how that happened, step by step.
</P>
<P>
   Making his debut feature in a film that will be shown Saturday
night at 6 and Sunday at 3 p.m. at the New Directors/New Films
series, Doueiri (who has worked as a cameraman on films by Quentin
Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, and has the visual ingenuity those
credits suggest) casts his younger brother in its central role.
</P>
<P>
   Rami Doueiri plays the teen-age Tarek, the only son of parents
who dote on him. In this household, where the parents are worldly
and opinionated, Tarek's complaints about attending a French school
are a main source of strife until larger crises abruptly leave
their mark.
</P>
<P>
   With the April 1975 massacre of a busload of civilians, Beirut
is suddenly on its way to becoming a war zone. It becomes a divided
city, with military checkpoints even for a Muslim native like
Tarek's father (Joseph Bou Nassar) and danger zones where not even
the most intrepid schoolboy ought to go.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Tarek nor his friends are inclined to play it safe
or take no for an answer. So they roam through the city guided by
the factors that most matter to them, like finding a place that
will develop Super 8 movies they furtively took of an older man's
sexy new girlfriend. At first they travel blithely, but the film
shows how the war affects even happily indifferent teen-agers. It's
no longer easy for a Muslim like Tarek to be smitten with May (Rola
al-Amin), who wears a crucifix around her neck. Tarek's friend
Omar, who instigated taking the naughty pictures and has an
``Airport 1975'' poster in his room, is suddenly being told by his
newly fundamentalist father that he must fast for Ramadan and give
up theater, cinema and rock-and-roll.
</P>
<P>
   With a feisty, believable performance from his brother Rami,
Doueiri gradually shows its hero coming of age while war destroys
all the ordinariness in this teen-ager's life. It watches as the
rubble piles up, the streets grow more dangerous and the kindly
local grocer has to cope with a desperate bread line. ``West
Beirut'' registers these changes in sometimes predictable, dutiful
fashion but there's no mistaking the grief at the heart of its
story.

   The film's English subtitles sometimes inject levity where it's
least expected, as with ``Holy-moly macaroni!'' or ``You're

piquant exclamation at the sight of a beautiful woman is ``What a

 &HT;    A wealthy interest in the Web
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When, exactly, did South by Southwest
Interactive become $X$W?
</P>
<P>
   The young festival, which continues to be overshadowed by its
film and music counterparts, had a serious face lift this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's festival was very much about expanding the
possibilities of the Internet _ how it could be broadened as a tool
for communication, enlightenment, education and culture. This year,
however, talk of page views, Internet alliances and the
ever-looming specter of the Initial Public Offering dominated the
discussion. The festival, in a word, was about cash.
</P>
<P>
   While there was a series of panels on money and marketing last
year, it was just one of five areas covered. This year, the
business side of the Web accounted for a third of the panels and
pervaded discussion at many of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the lofty ``technology for human evolution'' talk
survived, it was like watching Tom Hanks navigate the beach in
``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the snarky editors of Suck.com and local Web icon Harry
Knowles, creator of the www.aint-it-cool-news.com Web site about
movies, spent a good portion of their time fielding questions about
banner advertisements and their money-making potential in addition
to questions about cultural relevance and what Internet
publications are doing to change the reader/writer relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this is a bad thing. The interactive festival is just
reflecting a shift that is happening on the Net itself. Net stocks
are hot. Internet business has generated a buzz and captured the
imagination of Wall Street. Every company that hopes to compete in
the next century must get on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   As talented and independent Web 'zine publisher Nikol Lohr of
www.
</P>
<P>
   disgruntledhousewife.com told me, ``I think it's this awesome
unanimous revelation that we're suddenly a legitimate industry, and
we deserve to get a little scratch for what we're doing. So viva la
dough!''
</P>
<P>
   The few success stories that the Web has spawned _ Yahoo, eBay,
Dell's phenomenal Web-based sales _ have proven that there is money
to made on the Web. Unfortunately for those who dreamed of a
multimillion dollar advertising deal for mom and pop literary
magazine, the money to be made is not in content.
</P>
<P>
   For every Amazon.com, there are several thousand Web sites that
have compelling, highly readable content. But with no product to
sell and a fragmented market, page views alone rarely translate
into dollars for these Web ventures.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no wonder that SXSW has turned its attention to the
bottom line. The billions of dollars being generated by the few
Internet success stories is a siren call to all those who'd hoped
they could strike it rich with only their talent.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, the Net is becoming a place of business, and
the smart sites are those that are balancing great content with
good business sense _ The Onion, for instance, is more than just an
online humor 'zine. It has developed a huge audience, attracted
appropriate advertisers and sold merchandise through its site.
</P>
<P>
   The shift, most likely, was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   But at a gathering in which some of the brightest minds in the
industry laid out their brains for the picking, it was
disheartening to see so much interest in the riches to be made from
the Net and so little attention paid to what a year ago seemed to
have limitless potential as a medium of communication.
</P>
<P>
   Like those who have begun to turn Las Vegas into the family
entertainment destination, the taming of the Internet has rendered
it another tool for commercialism. But before we condemn it for
this, let's not forget the artists and techies who laid the
groundwork for the medium _ their long-overdue payday may finally
come.

LET'S GIVE SOME CREDIT TO FORMER HARVARD PRESIDENT PUSEY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Searching for a way to convey how remarkable it seemed that a
once-small Rhode Island bank earlier this month had acquired
through merger the once-impregnable symbol of Yankee dominion
formerly known as the First National Bank of Boston, I stirred up a
certain amount of protest when I suggested that Nathan Pusey was
entitled to the credit or blame.
</P>
<P>
   Pusey, who at 91 still summers in Maine, was president of
Harvard University when Terrence Murray, the future president of
Fleet Financial Group, was admitted to Harvard College in 1958. As
the son of a factory hand from Woonsocket, Murray was not the
stereotypical Harvard man of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Murray in those days (or at least others of his ilk)
was more likely to be found beating the tar out of the likes of
Charles ``Chad'' Gifford, who grew up to be his opposite number at
BankBoston Corp. As a teenager bound for Europe, Gifford stepped
from the SS Andrea Doria to the decks of rescue steamer Ile de
France after the passenger liner was rammed and sunk by a Swedish
ship in the autumn of 1956 _ without so much as getting his feet
wet.
</P>
<P>
   To momentarily recall Harvard's aggressive search in the 1950s
for boys such as Murray seemed like a way of calling attention to
the role the college played over more than a century in undermining
the rule of the old White Anglo-Saxon Protestant ascendency and
creating the far more nearly equal-opportunity society in which we
live today.
</P>
<P>
   A number of persons called or wrote to say that I had singled
out the wrong man as author of the policy of inclusion. Herb Regal,
for example, said it was James B. Conant, president before Pusey,
who really opened up the college. It was Henry Chauncy, an aide to
Pusey who later served as president of the Educational Testing
Service, wrote William Wrean. The policy of geographical
diversification ``spread to Yale and `Yanked' me right out of
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   I decided to take a closer look. I turned to John T. Bethell,
who edited Harvard's alumni magazine for 30 years. To celebrate the
magazine's centenary last year, Bethell published ``Harvard
Observed: An Illustrated History of the University in the Twentieth
Century,'' a survey as lively and various as its subject. In the
book, among much else, I found the story of Paul Buck and the
``floppy ducklings.''.
</P>
<P>
   A few words about Harvard's place in the firmament of US higher
education. It was the first college, and therefore all others have
evolved in contrast to it, whether the old universities of the Ivy
League (Yale, Princeton;) the South (William and Mary, Virginia;)
the myriad little colleges (Amherst, Bowdoin, Williams, and the
like;) the land-grant universities (Michigan, Wisconsin,
California;) the German-style research institutions (Johns Hopkins,
Chicago, Stanford;) or the great regional universities of the
present day (Northwestern, Duke, Rice.)
</P>
<P>
   All owe their identity to some extent to having become what
Harvard is not. This is even more the case in Boston, where the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston College, Boston
University, Brandeis University, Northeastern University and
Wellesley College _ not to mention Bentley, Suffolk, Emerson,
Simmons, Emmanuel and Pine Manor _ share niche space with the
Cambridge college whose origins date to 1636.
</P>
<P>
   People who know Harvard well say that it can best be understood
as a franchise. There are a college, its alumni, the school of arts
and sciences, its departments, the various professional schools,
the hospitals, museums, libraries, forests and villas: each largely
self-governed, yet susceptible in the end to some forms of overall
management. Hence the vital role of presidents of the university.
</P>
<P>
   It was Charles W. Eliot who set out to transform Harvard from a
New England college into an institution of national standing in
scope, Bethell says. During the 40 years he served as president
(starting in 1869), Eliot often said that he aimed to make Harvard
``a college of broad democratic resort,'' where students with
``much money, little money, or no money at all,'' would feel at
home, ``provided they all have brains.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the turn of the century, Bethell noted, Harvard
always had a larger proportion of Jewish and Irish students than
any comparable college. In 1919 an Irish Catholic was elected to
the Corporation that governed the university; by the mid 1920s,
representation of Jews body had reached 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   True, said Bethell, A. Lawrence Lowell, who succeeded Eliot,
unfortunately endorsed a Jewish quota. He also expressed
reservations about the presence in the college of
African-Americans. But Lowell, too, embraced a democratic vision of
college life and pursued the freshman dormitories and upper-class
houses that are Harvard's most successful integrating institutions.
</P>
<P>
   James B. Conant took Eliot's vision a step further with a
program of national scholarships instituted in 1934, designed to
bring promising graduates from the hinterlands. Where Eliot and
Lowell both had been Boston Brahmins, Conant's roots were in the
middle class, Bethell noted. Pusey, who succeeded Conant, was from
Iowa, of all places; Derek Bok, while technically from
Philadelphia, had been raised mainly in California; and Neil
Rudenstine, the current president, is half-Jewish and half Italian.
His mother was a waitress.
</P>
<P>
   Bethell says that when he set out to write his book he expected
to show that generational changes were bound up in changes in the
body of knowledge and applications of technology. That was true
enough, he said. ``but as I plowed ahead with my research it became
clear that there was one great agent of change that loomed much
larger than any other; one powerful catalyst that sped up the
processes of change already at work at all levels of society. It
stood out like the proverbial elephant in the drawing room. And
that, of course, was war.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the World war II, more than any other, that propelled
Harvard farthest into the vanguard of change. In 1949, for example,
veterans counsellor John Munro, noted the presence of fewer than 20
African Americans in the college and argued that a program of
recruiting ``really excellent Negro students'' would help
``materially on one of the country's sorest social problems.'' But
it was an article in the alumni bulletin in February 1946, to which
Bethell devoted a sidebar, that really caught my eye _ since it
offered a pretty good insight into how Fleet Financial's Terry
Murray advanced to the top of that bank.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Buck was a history professor; he served as provost, or
Conant's second in command during the War, and was the logical
candidate to succeed him as president in 1953, except that he
declined the honor. He died in 1978. In 1946, Buck was caught in
the middle between those who wanted Harvard to admit only those
applicants with the highest test scores, and those who wanted as
more fully rounded class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I share the often heard view that (the) College would be
improved if it had a larger share of the healthy, extrovert kind of
American youth which is so admired by the American public,'' wrote
Buck. Applications received through the veterans office compared
favorably with those coming in through the College examination
Board, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect 95 percent of (applicants) from the large
metropolitan public high schools of New york and New Jersey are of
one category _ bright, precocious, intellectually overstimulated
boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``For another example, I suspect a large proportion of the
Harvard applicants from the larger private schools of those same
states are not at all representative of those schools but are
weighted with the delicate, literary types of boys who don't make
the grade socially with their better-balanced classmates who, in
turn, head for Yale or Princeton.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard ``has done much to supply skillful, sympathetic advice
and medical treatment to the sensitive, neurotic boy who has some
talent. The result is that solicitous parents connive with
harrassed schoolmasters to send their floppy ducklings our way. And
the pressure to deposit them in our small pond increases in
proportion as we improve their survival rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not propose that we should take any action to stop the
flow to Harvard of the studious or sensitive type of boys. We must
not lose the advantage we now have from the appeal of Harvard to
the exceptional boy, even if he is a bit `queer' from the
standpoint of his fellows.'' Instead, Buck proposed an extended
scouting organization to search out a different sort of student. It
was one of these, presumably, who endorsed Terry Murray's
application.
</P>
<P>
   The rest, of course, is history. Harvard opened its doors ever
more widely. It began actively recruiting African-American students
in the 1960s. In the 1970s, it fully integrated women into its
classes and set a target of one for one. The 1980s saw an influx of
non-traditional students, due to changes in the Immigration Act of
1965. And in the millenial class of 2001, Bethell writes, 48.5
percent are women. Some 35 percent of the 2,040 students represent
ethnic minorities: 18 percent Asian American, 8.6 Hispanic, 8
percent black and 0.7 percen Native Back in the 1950s, when this
trend was becoming unmistakable to the alumni of the college,
Bethell's book recounts an  &UR; evening &LR;  when Nathan Pusey fielded a
question from a slightly tipsy old grad at a Harvard Club dinner.
What about my son, the member asked, ``whose ancestors came over on
the Mayflower, and whose father went to Harvard, and his father
went to Harvard, and his father went to Harvard, and now he. .
.can't. . .get. . .in!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' said Pusey, ``We can't send him back. The Mayflower
doesn't run any more.''

MCCAIN WANTS TO PUT BOXING, OLYMPICS INTO HOT SEAT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McCain has been in more hot seats than most of us put
together. There was the Corvette he drove too fast in his early
20's; the Navy trainer that crashed into Corpus Christi Bay when
the engine quit; the A-4 Skyhawk that blew up as he awaited takeoff
on the carrier (begin itals) Forrestal; his second Skyhawk, that
got shot down over Vietnam; the cell in the Hanoi Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   Survive enough of those kinds of scrapes, and the notion of
chairing hearings of the Senate Commerce Committee, or even running
for the Republican party's presidential nomination, does not
exactly fill you with dread. But all his life _ as pilot, POW,
politician, presidential possibility _ McCain has been a sports
fan. Sports nut is more like it.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why he was sitting ringside at the Holyfield-Lewis
heavyweight fight that ended in a draw, to the disgrace of
professional boxing, and the ire of Muhammad Ali. The three-time
champ wrote McCain, supporting the Arizona senator's intent to
reform boxing by outlawing the kind of legal bondage that enables
promoters like the infamous Don King to manipulate the rules, the
laws and the contracts in ways that lead to outrageous outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Professional boxing can be reformed in a manner that will
honor its athletes, respect its fans, and serve the public's
interest in honest competition,'' declared McCain, who's pushed
boxing reform for six years.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to note that number: Six. It signifies McCain is
no publicity-hungry, vote-sniffing political bull-slinger, hopping
on an issue when its hot, and unsaddling when it cools. As he
proved in fighting the Big Money interests in the
telecommunications reform struggle, the tobacco war in Congress,
and in the losing struggle for campaign finance reform, when John
McCain comes to the fray, he stays to fight. To the end, as his
Vietnamese captors learned.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the International Olympic Committee should be very
nervous. The IOC, and Juan Antonio Samaranch, the dictatorial
bureaucrat who runs this intensely private and intensely profitable
monopolistic cabal, have been ``invited'' by McCain to a Senate
hearing on April 14 to discuss corruption at the highest levels of
the IOC's secretive oligarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Around the planet, athletes, fans, governments and sport
federations will watch to see what happens. McCain's former
colleague, George Mitchell, who's become the man to pick when a job
needs doing right, headed the commission probing Salt Lake City's
winning bid for the 2000 Winter Olympics. The IOC was tarnished by
widespread bribery and vote-peddling by IOC members, who are
handpicked by Samaranch. It turns out the IOC is a totally private
organization which legally owns the legal rights to the Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell found ``a culture of corruption.'' McCain, as the
appropriate Senate chairman, wants to see more reform than the
pallid, cosmetic clean-up presided over by Samaranch. In this
endeavor, McCain is heartily supported by David D'Alessandro, CEO
of John Hancock, whose Boston-based insurance company has forked
over $100 million in Olympic sponsorship over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro is the most outspoken American sponsor who's raised
cain (and McCain) about the rot at the core of the Olympic
movement. Threatening to withold Hancock's $20 million in sponsor
fees for the upcoming Olympics, D'Alessandro has become the
toughest of the 11 major corporate sponsors. The spokesmen for
outfits such as Xerox, Visa, Coca Cola and others are less vocal.
</P>
<P>
   And the bosses at NBC, who have a lot of dough riding on their
broadcast rights, have been choking on their muffins. All the suits
with money on the line are watching McCain's lips. Because the old
jet jockey is packing some heavy weaponry. Here's a hint, buried in
a letter McCain sent to the IOC: ``The IOC enjoys tax-exempt status
. . . Corporate sponsorships by US corporations represent a
substantial majority of IOC revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: You people better clean up your act, pronto, or a
bill to change the US tax laws to obliterate the tax breaks may
quickly follow. It is the tax laws that enable big corporations to
pay for the sponsorship that puts on the games and eventually
filters down to the amatuer athletic foundations around the planet
that train the kids. This is no idle threat. D'Alessandro, who
carries no olive branch for Samaranch, says Samaranch took only
cosmetic action, firing nine IOC bribe-takers, and disciplining
some others. ``It's a brilliant job of PR, but a terrible job of
reform,'' said the Hancock chief.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro is delighted at McCain diving into the twin swamps
of Olympic bribery and boxing corruption. ``He (McCain) is talking
about something that will really get the sponsors' attention.
Because he's suggesting that the tax deductibility of sponsoring
might get eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   What should happen, of course, is that the 78-year old Samaranch
get blasted out of office, and the IOC, as Mitchell recommends,
should be reformed to open up the books and dismantle the
autocratic bureaucracy assembled by Samaranch. And after that, when
McCain gets around to boxing, later next month at a date yet to be
settled, the notorious Don King should get the rubber-hose
treatment in front of the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   King and Samaranch are very similar in character, if not in
diction: both men are longtime schemers who have cemented
themselves at the very center of the spider web which flourishes
off the corrupt exercise of exclusive rights to sporting
extravaganzas in the television age.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man will willingly don the handcuffs and march offstage.
It is the sponsors who are ultimately accountable to the public,
and it is the sponsors, as D'Alessandro enthusiastically predicts,
who must eventually take responsibility for cleaning up sport
empires corrupted by entrenched, unaccountable, oligarchs.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican presidential contenders are deeply
divided over whether the United States should play any role in
Serbia, and most accused President Clinton of a misguided foreign
policy that led to this country's entanglement there.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews and public statements, about half the candidates
said they supported the bombing. They are Sen. John McCain of
Arizona; Elizabeth Dole, former president of the American Red
Cross; Steve Forbes, the publishing magnate, and former Gov. Lamar
Alexander of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Those who opposed American involvement are former Vice President
Dan Quayle; Rep. John Kasich of Ohio; Sen. Bob Smith of New
Hampshire; Pat Buchanan, the conservative commentator, and Gary
Bauer, the prominent religious conservative.
</P>
<P>
   The early favorite for the Republican nomination, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, was the last contender to stake out a position, and
his is the most nuanced. Bush said American troops deserve full
support, but he stopped short of endorsing the decision for
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the president has committed to use force, I hope he
will do so decisively and successfully,'' Bush said in his
statement, adding that ``the ultimate question is: Will this
military action lead to the goal of ending the conflict and
bringing peace and stability to the region?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Mrs. Dole, who lead the Republican field in the early
polls, were the only contenders who declined to be interviewed to
discuss their positions. Mrs. Dole issued only a brief statement,
saying the president's action ``can be instrumental in forging a
peaceful solution to a dangerous, escalating military conflict.''
Bush, in addition to his statement, took questions about the matter
at a news conference in Texas on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush and Mrs. Dole were careful not to criticize Clinton,
most other Republicans on both sides _ after offering their support
for Americans sent into action _ showed no hesitation to fault the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he backed the bombing ``because of the ethnic
cleansing and the threat of it spreading through the region.'' But,
he said, Clinton's earlier failure to follow through on threats
against President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia led to an
``enormous erosion of our credibility, not only in the region but
throughout the world.'' McCain added, ``You don't make threats
unless you are willing and capable of carrying them out.''
</P>
<P>
   From another vantage point, Kasich also ridiculed Clinton.
``We're getting dangerously close to the point when world leaders
take a look at what Saddam Hussein has done and people think they
can thumb their nose at us,'' he said. ``Maybe Milosevic has
decided that if Saddam Hussein can ride it out, `maybe I can as
well.' How many weeks have we been threatening this man?''
</P>
<P>
   But Kasich argued against American involvement, saying: ``I see
it as essentially a civil war and something people have been
concerned about for centuries. This is not a matter of whose heart
bleeds more for innocent people being brutalized or killed. The
question is, can a great power have the discipline to define what
is in the direct national interest because without the discipline
you diminish yourself _ and when you diminish yourself the world
becomes less secure.''
</P>
<P>
   In criticizing Clinton over foreign policy, Republicans are
seizing on one of the few areas in which polls find that people
trust their party more than Democrats. Those who oppose American
participation may also be playing to an isolationist segment of the
Republican primary electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are fighting for their core constituency of right-wing
fundamentalists who say, `Let's stay home and take care of our own,
deal with our issues first,''' said Barbara Bardes, a professor of
political science at the University of Cincinnati. ``The other
Republicans are guarding their bets; you don't want to be on record
being really deeply in favor of this because they don't want to get
trapped if next week we have video pictures of hundreds of Kosovers
massacred in a mass grave.''

   Republican voters are less supportive of the airstrikes than are
Democrats. A CBS News Poll conducted Wednesday evening found that
while a large majority of Democrats supported the airstrikes
against Serbia, Republicans and Independents were more divided.
Among Democrats, 61 percent were in favor of the American
involvement and 18 percent were against it. Republicans were evenly
split _ 44 percent in support and 41 percent against.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics of the Republican primary electorate is more
isolationist, nationalistic and fundamentalist than the electorate
as a whole,'' said Stanley Greenberg, a Democrat pollster who has
worked in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush released a statement only after some candidates criticized
him for not being forthcoming. ``This is about war and peace and
life and death,'' Buchanan said of Bush. ``I don't think you can
declare a moratorium on discussing matters of this magnitude if you
presume to lead the United States of America into the 21st
Century.'' Buchanan said he opposed American involvement because
``this is an ugly civil war on the Balkan peninsula where no vital
American interests are engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Bush was vague when asked whether he
agreed with Clinton's rationale for the bombing. ``My question is,
`Is it good for America?''' he asked. ``And that'll be the question
I'll ask should I end up being the president. Right now as
governor, I'm going to go figure out how to get a tax cut
through.''
</P>
<P>
   In opposing the bombing, Quayle asserted that had he been
president the nation would not find itself enmeshed in Serbia.
``You have to have credibility when you're sitting down and
negotiating,'' he said. ``The United States right now is a paper
tiger. Do you really believe you're going to be able to bomb
Milosevic into submission? If they think they can, they know a
different Milosevic than I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining his opposition, Smith said: ``We see here an
emotional reaction to a terrible humanitarian crisis. We could have
done more to put pressure on Serbia through its neighbors. You
can't jump into every civil war that's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   While Forbes also criticized Clinton, he backed the president's
action. ``It's no surprise that Milosevic was going to push the
thing and we've let him get away with it,'' he said. ``We could
have avoided all of the bloodshed if we had been firmer earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said he feared that the president's decision would
lead to use of American ground troops. ``If we put forces on the
ground,'' he said, ``there is a moral obligation. The president
should say we are likely to be there for a long time, and there is
a likelihood that we will have to send additional ground forces to
protect our peacekeepers.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, the only rival to Vice
President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination, sounded like some
of the Republicans: He backed the bombing but raised ``serious
questions'' about the administration's stewardship of foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are escalating our commitment without establishing a clear
exit strategy,'' Bradley said. ``As with Bosnia, we run the risk of
becoming bogged down in a quagmire whose end we cannot predict or
control.''

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, March 26 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: KOSOVO
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday passed, 58-41, a resolution supporting
President Clinton's decision to deploy air strikes against Serb
forces in the Kosovo province of Yugoslavia. Supporters said
inaction is unacceptable when innocent people are being killed and
that Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic must be contained.
Opponents said it was too risky of an endeavor and there was no
clear strategy to end the assault. A ``yes'' vote favors the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: SENATE BUD
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 55-44, a $1.7 trillion budget
plan that outlines spending goals for the next year. The plan would
cut taxes over the next several years, help finance the ailing
Social Security system and increase spending for education and
defense. Supporters of the Republican proposal said the bill saves
Social Security while still providing tax cuts and staying within
the parameters of a balanced budget. Opponents said the bill only
provides tax relief to the rich and does not adequately address the
need to save Medicare. A ``yes'' vote favors the proposal.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: EMERGENCY
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 220-211, a $1.2 billion
emergency supplemental spending bill that includes aid for Central
America, farm relief and for Jordan's implementation of the Wye
Peace accords. The measure almost failed, but the Republican
leadership held the vote open until they could lobby enough votes
to pass the bill. Opponents said while they support the intent of
the bill, they were concerned that important programs would be cut
in order to offset the cost of the package. Supporters said it is a
necessary package and therefore the offsets are justified. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: HOUSE BUD
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 221-208, a $1.7 trillion budget
plan that outlines spending goals for the next year. The plan would
cut taxes over the next few years, shore up the Social Security
system by setting aside the Social Security surplus revenue and
increase spending for education and defense. Supporters of the
Republican proposal said the bill saves Social Security while still
providing tax cuts and staying within the parameters of a balanced
budget. Opponents said the bill only provides tax relief to the
rich and does not adequately address the need to save Medicare. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the military allies
gave detailed briefings twice a day, in Washington and in Saudi
Arabia, announcing the number of combat flights, the targets hit
and Iraqi troop movements.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters complained of being spoon-fed only what the Pentagon
wanted them to know, without a chance to confirm independently the
damage to Baghdad's forces.
</P>
<P>
   But at least it was something, which is considerably more than
is being disclosed about the bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The American military has clammed up on many of the most basic
details of the operation. Pentagon briefers have refused to discuss
what the pilots are trying to bomb, or whether they have destroyed
particular targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're clearly taking a more conservative approach than in the
past,'' said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon. ``We want to give
adversaries as little information as possible about our techniques,
intentions and expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they are trying to protect pilots
flying risky missions who could be shot down and captured by Serb
forces. They are also worried about offending the sensibilities of
a shaky European coalition.
</P>
<P>
   There is rising concern among senior officials that the
government has become overly casual in its handling of classified
information, a complacency that Bacon attributed to a belief that
American interests are less at risk in the post-Cold War era. There
is also, he said, a growing hunger for operational details from
news media driven by 24-hour news cycles.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said relatively little about last summer's
airstrikes against suspected terrorist sites in Afghanistan and
Sudan (even a subsequent awards ceremony for the pilots was held in
secret) and the current low-level bombing campaign against Iraq (so
as not to upset Persian Gulf allies).
</P>
<P>
   The sensitivities of the 19-member NATO alliance have added
another element to the Serbia operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some European allies who don't like this portrayed
as too much of an American show, and there are other allies who
don't want information about their role put out at all,'' said a
senior spokesman for one branch of the armed forces, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO military commander, who has
authority over what information to release, pays careful attention
to these nationalistic idiosyncracies.
</P>
<P>
   At headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, on Friday, a British air
commodore, David Wilby, gave the first details on the total number
of NATO flights (400), a partial list of some of the Yugoslav
targets (18 of 50 sites), the damage inflicted to them (light to
totally destroyed) and videotapes of some of the successful
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   But the alliance's spokesmen still are not talking about
casualties on the ground, the operation's cost, the dogfights that
downed a total of five Yugoslav MiG's and the country-by-country
makeup of the attacking air forces.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, senior administration officials are following a
tightly choreographed script as they seek to manage information and
perceptions of the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright appeared on three of the
television morning news shows on Friday, repeating the
administration's deter-or-be-destroyed mantra to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic. But she shied away from specific questions on
reports of massacres by Serbs in Kosovo or attacks on American
embassy employees in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what the administration would do if Milosevic does
not bow to the bombing, the president's national security adviser
Samuel Berger, sidestepped the question: ``There's one end state if
we do nothing. The end state in the other direction is either a
peace, which we hope to be the case, or a severely diminished
military capacity for Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   And Defense Secretary William Cohen and Gen. Henry Shelton, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, say it is too early to
discuss publicly the impact of bombing by B-2s and B-52s.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe with journalists. But in an effort to keep a skeptical
Congress supportive, or at least not hostile, military intelligence
analysts gave lawmakers an upbeat, richly detailed classified
assessment on Thursday of the early attacks, proudly showing off
satellite photographs of heavily damaged Yugoslav targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going extremely well,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton of
Missouri, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Given the secrecy surrounding ongoing military missions,
administrations have the upper hand in controlling the flow of
information and the spokesmen for that news.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter suggested to Bacon that he might buff his
credibility by admitting that some American bombs missed their
mark, as a British military spokesman said this week about some
British strikes, the Pentagon spokesman acknowledged the
information lock-down: ``You haven't heard about many bombs hitting
their targets, either. I think we've been pretty even-handed.''

 DRYSIAK RESIGNS AS PRESIDENT AND COO OF TOYS `R' US  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just a year after arriving at Toys ``R'' Us as second in
command, Bruce W. Krysiak has resigned as president and chief
operating officer of the beleaguered retailer.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse statement announcing his abrupt departure, the
company gave only the obligatory explanation that he was leaving
``to pursue other interests.'' But the resignation of Krysiak, 48,
is emblematic of the continuing turmoil at the company, the world's
largest toy seller, analysts said. Management is struggling with
increasing competition and declining profits.
</P>
<P>
   In the company statement, Krysiak insisted, ``This has been a
difficult decision that has nothing to do with the direction in
which Toys `R' Us is headed.'' A company spokeswoman said he was
unavailable for further comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Krysiak, who was also president of the American toy store
division, had made no secret of his aspirations to be the company's
next chief executive. The analysts said that he apparently
concluded that he would either not be elevated to that level or
that the company's troubles were worse than he expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he probably took the position that `If I can turn this
thing around I'll be CEO,''' said Sean P. McGowan, an analyst with
Gerald Klauer Mattison. ``When a guy steps into a situation with
one set of expectations and sees that they are not going to be met,
maybe he moves on.''
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us, which is based in Paramus, N.J., said that Mike
Shannon, 47, executive vice president, had been named president of
the United States division. The company did not name an executive
to replace Krysiak as president of the overall company and chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us has been struggling with how to hold on to
once-loyal shoppers who have grown weary of its mammoth stores, as
well as how to compete more effectively with discount chains like
Walmart that are selling a wide selection of playthings at
affordable prices.
</P>
<P>
   Those pressures contributed to a plunge in the company's profits
and prompted a restructuring last year. Management closed dozens of
outdated stores and dismissed thousands of workers. Even after
those steps, the company's financial performance has remained
dismal.
</P>
<P>
   After disappointing results in 1997, the company posted a $132
million loss, or 50 cents a share, last year, largely stemming from
charges related to its restructuring. In the last quarter of the
year _ during the all-important holiday shopping season _ Toys
``R'' Us' profits fell 18 percent on flat revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Krysiak, who was president and chief operating officer of the
Dollar General Corp. before joining Toys ``R'' Us in February 1998,
was brought in to help revive the company. At the time, investors
cheered the appointment because Toys ``R'' Us had been criticized
for having an insular culture in which management lacked the sort
of fresh vision that often comes from outsiders with a new
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ``I think he was probably not the right man at this
time,'' said Walter F. Loeb, of the investment firm Loeb
Associates. ``He came from Dollar General, which has a lot of
stores but doesn't have the seasonality of the challenges of Toys
`R' Us.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his arrival a year ago, however, Robert C.
Nakasone, the Toys ``R'' Us chief executive, said that ``Bruce
Krysiak's years of experience in retail operations, merchandising
and marketing will be invaluable as we move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Nakasone, who has been chief executive for only a year,
said in the statement that, ``we appreciate his contributions over
the past year and wish him well in his future endeavors.'' Through
a spokeswoman he declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced the management changes after the market
closed. Its shares were virtually unchanged at $17.625.

 &HT;    Profit draught fuels tobacco equipment auction
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWN SUMMIT, N.C. _ Roy Cook cranked up the John Deere
high-cycle tobacco sprayer, listening closely for any skips in the
loud rumbling engine.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-year-old farmer hopes to fetch top dollar for the
green-and-yellow rig in today's farm equipment auction, a
first-time event for the Guilford County Farmers Club and a signal
of the uncertainty facing tobacco growers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to turn it into a little cash,'' said Cook,
the third generation of his family to farm the reddish-brown soil
of piedmont North Carolina. ``It is hard times.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the South's tobacco belt, farmers are suddenly tightening
their belts amid declining cigarette consumption, which has crimped
demand for the crop. Generation after generation, the golden leaf
sustained rural communities from south Georgia through the
Carolinas and Virginia. But now farmers, facing sharp cutbacks in
the amount of flue-cured leaf the government allows them to grow,
are worried about their survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tobacco has been a sheet of plyboard over a mudhole. You
always had a place to put your foot,'' said E.B. Harris, owner of
Warrenton, N.C.-based Goins &AMP; Harris, one of the largest
auctioneers of tobacco farming equipment. ``Now ... if you step the
wrong way, you get your foot muddy.''
</P>
<P>
   By rough estimates, the number of U.S. flue-cured growers has
shrunk from 40,000 in 1975 to 25,000 today. The recent government
cutbacks portend further casualties _ and a hastening liquidation
of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this fall's crop, I think there will be an upswing in
auctions,'' said Rick Murray, the auctioneer for today's sale in
Brown Summit, just north of Greensboro. Local farmers who grow
tobacco, grain and other crops have put up for sale more than 230
pieces of equipment, valued at roughly $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even before tobacco is planted in coming weeks, pessimistic
farmers are fretting that in December the U.S. Agriculture
Department may cut the flue-cured tobacco allotment by another 10
percent for the 2000 crop. That would be on top of a 35 percent
reduction for this year's upcoming crop and last year's.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, a 35 percent reduction in allotment equates
to that much in lost profits to farmers. That's a hit few growers
can sustain without slashing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some are burdened by debt on equipment and supplies; others are
looking to free up cash to get this spring's crop in the ground. A
few are simply getting out of farming, and turning to auctions to
liquidate their machinery.
</P>
<P>
   For years, auctions have been popular among farmers looking to
replace outdated equipment with more automated, efficient models.
But until recently, few tobacco growers have felt compelled by
financial pressures to sell machinery.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many farmers are like barnyard pack rats, accumulating
tractors and harrows and sprayers they haven't used for years. But
their fathers used them and, in some cases, their grandfathers did,
attaching worth beyond the monetary value of rusting metal and wood
as worn and weatherbeaten as old bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing runs deep, deeper than any roots that you've ever
seen,'' said Harris, 49, an auctioneer for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   It is painful for many farmers to sell, aside from the emotional
hurt. The more equipment that winds up in auctions, the less it
brings in price. Even worse, most tobacco equipment _ such as plant
setters, harvesters and pre-fabricated curing barns _ is
specialized for that crop alone, diminishing the number of
potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad thing is, are there going to be any buyers?'' said
Jerry Keck, 48, a fourth-generation farmer hoping to sell a tractor
and other equipment at the auction.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Holtzmann has decided to take a chance that there will be
enough buyers. A week from today, the fourth-generation tobacco
grower plans to auction all his equipment, including three tractors
that have belonged to his family ``for as long as I can remember.''
</P>
<P>
   At 34, he is quitting tobacco farming on his Norlina, N.C.,
farm, 125 miles northeast of Brown Summit near the Virginia state
line. Holtzmann is not sure how he will earn a living. He has three
daughters, ages 5, 7 and 9. His wife, Laura, decorates cakes at a
local grocery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably going to miss the planting of the crop,'' he
said. ``But I'm not going to miss the headache of worrying about
whether it is going to rain, whether I'm going to have decent
labor, whether or not it is going to be enough to pay the bills.

   NEW YORK _ The set, with a gorgeous 1930s dressing table at its
center, promises sophistication. The source, a Mary McCarthy short
story, promises wit. The actress, in a fur coat, an oversize silk
scarf and sunglasses, delivers. As Meg Sargeant, Adrianna Dufay
strips to a black bra, girdle and stockings to perform the
monologue that is the title piece of ``Cruel and Barbarous
Treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't really love a man if everybody didn't think he was
wonderful,'' says Meg, who is preparing for her trip to Reno after
a thrilling extramarital affair. In her lingerie, she confesses; as
she dresses again, she covers up her feelings, too, in a noirish
staging that is almost cinematic.
</P>
<P>
   The Culture Project's skillfully directed production, three
short acts based on three marvelous short stories, is somewhere
between a reading and a full-blown play. The characters sometimes
recite narration, referring to themselves in the third person (``He
put his clothes back on''); one act also has a narrator (Brett
Cramp) who does radio-style sound effects. It's the ideal balance,
preserving the authors' language but bringing their characters
fully to life.
</P>
<P>
   Meg returns in the third act, ``The Man in the Brooks Brothers
Suit,'' also by Mary McCarthy, in which she has a few drinks on the
train and gets to know a married traveling salesman from Cleveland
better than she intended.
</P>
<P>
   In between, ``The 5:48,'' by John Cheever, reveals itself as the
original ``Fatal Attraction'' (but with humor). On his commuter
train to Shady Hill, Blake (J. Christopher O'Connor) encounters
Miss Dent (Annie McAdams), a dowdy young woman who whispers that
she has a gun inside her purse and will use it unless he follows
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Dent, with whom he had a one-night stand, does seem a
little disturbed, making comments like ``I haven't left the house
for two weeks'' and ``I've been thinking about devils.''
</P>
<P>
   The moral is never to hire a woman with peculiar handwriting and
a list of psychiatric hospitals on her resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cruel and Barbarous Treatment'' has its final performance
Saturday night at the Salon on the Upper East Side.

`VICTOR': ESCAPING CHILDHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The French director Sandrine Veysset has a special
gift for envisioning the world through the eyes of a child. Her
first film, ``Will It Snow for Christmas?,'' an examination of the
Spartan life of a French farming family, found everyday magic in
children's outdoor games and in the mystique of snow and holiday
preparations.
</P>
<P>
   In her second film, ``Victor,'' Ms. Veysset explores the
daydreams and nightmares of a young boy who runs away from home
after witnessing his parents in a kinky game of sexual bondage. The
brief glimpse we get of his parents' activities reveals little of
what's going on between them. It's enough, however, to drive the
boy out of the house. It's only much later that Victor (Jeremy
Chaix), when asked about the source of his pocket change, reveals
that his parents paid him to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing his home in the middle of a winter night, the boy ends
up riding the merry-go-round over and over at a nearby traveling
carnival. At the end of the evening, he faints into the arms of
Mick (Mathieu Lane), a young carnival worker who takes the lost
child to the apartment of his part-time girlfriend, Triche (Lydia
Andrei), a streetwalker.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the movie observes the deepening bond between the
boy and the prostitute, who becomes a protective surrogate mother.
Victor also develops a friendship with another boy who lives in an
apartment downstairs, and the movie affectionately observes their
childhood games, which include rummaging through Triche's clothes
one day while she is out of the house and dressing up and painting
themselves with her makeup.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, adapted from a novel by Denis Belloc, also follows
Triche on her dreary rounds, which consist mostly of hanging out in
doorways and having sex with strangers in cars. Late in the movie
we learn that Triche herself fled a sexually abusive background. As
her nurturing relationship with Victor begins to heal some of her
wounds, she summons the courage to stand up to her greedy madam.
Eventually she decides to quit prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   The studiedly drab movie, which New Directors/New Films is
showing Sunday at 6:30 p.m. and Monday at 6 p.m. at the Museum of
Modern Art, is dominated by shades of brown, gray and black, and
this minimalist look reflects the movie's world of numb, cauterized
feeling. That mood is so predominant that ``Victor'' feels
strangely detached.
</P>
<P>
   The closest it comes to evoking strong emotion is in its brief,
viscerally powerful dream sequences in which Victor finds himself
running in panic from a mob. At these moments, the movie does a
remarkable job of capturing the overwhelming terror of a common
nightmare in which there is no escape from an ominous, implacably
evil pursuer.

   Russia's chief prosecutor, Yuri Skuratov, has ordered an
investigation into anti-Semitic statements by Albert Makashov, a
Communist lawmaker. Makashov virtually invited a group of Cossacks
to ransack Jewish homes during a speech in the southern town of
Novocherkassk. He also said he was changing the name of his

U.S. AND RUSSIA SIGN URANIUM SALES DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Russia and the United States have quietly
signed an agreement that salvages a $12 billion deal aimed at
helping Russia convert uranium from its nuclear weapons into fuel
for U.S. nuclear reactors, Clinton administration officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The program to convert highly enriched uranium into
low-enrichment fuel is the key component of a three-part package
and part of the administration's effort to stop the spread of
nuclear weapons, administration officials said. The United States
and Russia have already taken steps to safeguard Russia's
nuclear-weapons material and contain damage from a nuclear accident
should one occur.
</P>
<P>
   The latest agreement was signed without publicity at a ceremony
at the Energy Department on Wednesday night, just hours after
cruise missiles began hitting targets in Yugoslavia. Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson and Russian Atomic Energy Minister
Yevgeny Adamov toasted each other with champagne.
</P>
<P>
   The accord was supposed to have been announced at the end of the
planned visit by Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, but he
aborted his visit en route to Washington on Tuesday after NATO
authorized the attacks on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said Friday that the new agreement put the
uranium-conversion deal, which was originally signed in 1993 but
quickly ran into trouble, ``on solid ground for years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia benefits and America benefits,'' he added, ``and that,
more than anything, symbolizes our new relationship. We seek mutual
security, not separate advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Deeply in debt and in desperate need of billions of dollars in
Western loans, Russia will now be able to sell 500 metric tons of
uranium from its nuclear warheads, worth an estimated $12 billion,
to the United States government and energy companies over the next
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said that under the 1993 agreement,
Russia diluted about 30 tons of weapons-grade uranium that was
supposed to be sold to the West. But the deal snagged over disputes
about the terms of the sale after uranium prices plunged, and
Russia stopped diluting the uranium last year.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall Congress and the administration agreed to spend $325
million to buy the natural uranium that had accumulated at market
prices. The administration then helped Russia conclude deals with
three energy companies _ Cameco of Canada, Cogema of France, and
Nukem of Germany. The contacts were signed two days ago, the
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The second part of the new agreement sets up two centers for
enhancing nuclear safety in Russia and the United States. The
centers, which will cost Washington about $1 million to open and up
to $2 million a year when fully operating, are supposed to enable
Russian and U.S. nuclear experts to cooperate in resolving
environmental issues associated with managing radioactive waste and
decontaminating plants that are taken out of commission.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. center will be located at the Idaho National
Engineering and Environmental Laboratory in Idaho Falls, the
historical home of research reactors and advanced test reactors. A
site for the Russian center has not been determined, but it will be
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The third part provides U.S. assistance to help the Russian
Atomic Energy Ministry establish a nuclear crisis center similar to
the Department of Energy's Emergency Operations Center in
Washington. The goal is to assemble experts and resources quickly
to help protect people in the event of an accident at a nuclear
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing Adamov's decision to stay in Washington despite
disagreements over the Yugoslavia bombing, the senior
administration who described the new accord said: ``We've had a lot
of ups and downs, politically and economically in our relationship.
But we've both kept our eyes on the importance of the shared goal
of helping Russia control its nuclear material and know-how.''

 &HT;    Boeing's wide-bodies built in 98-acre plant
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERETT, Wash. _ The world's biggest twin-engine jet is built in
the world's largest factory.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Co.'s wide-body plant in Everett, about 20 miles north of
downtown Seattle, defies the usual descriptions of big industrial
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   According to the company, 75 football fields or 10 whole
Kingdome arenas could fit inside the plant, which covers 98.3 acres
and has 2.2 miles of outside wall.
</P>
<P>
   The plant, built in 1968 and expanded in 1993, produces the 777,
747-400 and 767. Smaller narrow-body jets such as the 757 and 737
are built at another complex south of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has just under 100,000 employees in the area, even after
recent cutbacks, about one-third of them at the Everett complex.
</P>
<P>
   Each 777 consists of 3 million parts, some of them included in
prefabricated components shipped in from suppliers and others built
from scratch at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   It currently takes 45 days to assemble a 777 from start to
finish, down from 71 days when production began in 1995. The goal
is to reduce the time to 31 days by the end of this year and 20
days by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Major components are moved around the plant at night by overhead
cranes, in a delicate procedure known as ''the dance of the
cranes.'' The cranes cruise along 31 miles of overhead track, and
the operators are among the best-paid workers at the plant, since
multimillion-dollar components ride on their skill in gently
placing them in the correct spot.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing boasts that the 777 is its most precisely built aircraft,
owing to its computer-aided design and new laser alignment
processes on the assembly line. The company says fuselage sections
come within a few thousandths of an inch of perfect alignment.
</P>
<P>
   Once assembled, new planes are moved to a separate facility for
painting. While the amount varies by airline, Boeing says a typical
777 is covered by 586 pounds of paint.
</P>
<P>
   After that, planes are moved to a flight line for tests, where
they are lined up in an international parade of paint schemes
ranging from the sedate gray-blue of United to the new radical
dayglo tail design of Aeroflot, the Russian carrier.
</P>
<P>
   The first plane delivered to an airline might get a dozen or
more hours of flight testing. Once deliveries are under way, new
planes usually make only a two- or three-hour flight for certain
government-mandated checks before the customer accepts them.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, an airline could even sell tickets on the
outbound flight from Seattle. But carriers normally first take the
planes to their home base.

 &HT;    New plane joins Delta fleet
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A huge and expensive piece of the future has arrived
for Delta Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier took delivery Friday of its first Boeing 777, a $108
million giant that will become the carrier's premier international
airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Triple 7'' is the world's biggest twin-engine airliner _
it looks like a 767 on steroids, with engines almost as big around
as a 737's fuselage _ and is the first new model Delta has added to
its fleet in nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   A company delegation led by Chief Executive Leo F. Mullin
received the first 777 in a runway ceremony outside a Boeing
facility here, then rode the plane home to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is obviously the new queen of our fleet,'' Mullin said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, well-practiced in the art of making customers feel good
about their multimillion-dollar purchases, gave the group factory
tours Thursday and then hosted a delivery eve dinner at the
company's impressive aviation museum in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, the plane lifted off the Boeing Field runway
about 9 a.m. Seattle time (Noon EST) with two Atlanta-based
captains, Rod Smith and David Haines, at the controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I probably have the most enviable job in the airline
as far as pilots are concerned,'' said Smith, one of a handful who
got advance training and now will oversee instruction for others.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arrival in Atlanta 4 1/2 hours later, Smith and Haines flew
the 209-foot-long plane low over the runway at Hartsfield
International Airport, where Delta employees lined up outside the
airline's hangar and stared skyward.
</P>
<P>
   Smith rocked the wings back and forth in the universal aviation
greeting, then pulled the plane up and circled again for landing.
Hartsfield firetrucks gave the plane a water cannon salute as it
taxied to a gate.
</P>
<P>
   The first 777 had 13 hours of test flight time before Friday's
takeoff. It now will be used for about a month to train Delta
pilots, flight attendants, mechanics and ground handlers. It enters
service May 1 on the popular Atlanta-London route.
</P>
<P>
   Delta isn't the first airline to fly the 777. The plane is
already used by numerous airlines, including United, American and
Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Delta isn't even the first to fly it at Hartsfield; British
Airways beat it to the punch by putting a 777 on its Atlanta-London
route last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the 777 delivery is a tangible symbol of Delta's
financial resurgence in the latter half of the '90s. It's part of a
massive new airplane order Delta placed in 1997, after it had
recovered from a slump that forced it to cancel most aircraft
purchases and hold on to older planes longer.
</P>
<P>
   The plane also showcases Delta's new BusinessElite international
front cabin, with electrically operated recliner seats and
expansive legroom. BusinessElite replaces separate first- and
business-class sections on international flights and is being
retrofitted in Delta's older widebodies.
</P>
<P>
   Delta is gambling that a single, improved premium-class section
will lift its service image among international business fliers,
although most airlines are sticking with a three-class approach.
</P>
<P>
   Coach passengers won't notice much dimensional difference on the
777, but it features individual video screens mounted in each coach
seatback, making Delta one of only a handful of airlines offering
the technology. In addition, the coach cabin has new seats with
padded headrests and more comfort adjustment options.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the airplane, overhead bins were designed to slope up
more sharply, creating a noticeably airier feeling and more
headroom.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's 777s are powered by Rolls Royce Trent engines that
generate 40 percent more thrust, yet more quietly, than the engines
on the smaller 767.
</P>
<P>
   Delta is buying 13 777s for $1.4 billion and will have nine by
the end of this year. The second 777 will be delivered next week
and will be deployed briefly on an Atlanta-Orlando run for training
purposes, then on a Cincinnati-London route.
</P>
<P>
   The airline also has options, or reserved production slots, on
more of the planes once its initial order is filled.
</P>
<P>
   Delta plans to use the 777 on high-volume trans-Atlantic flights
from its hubs in Atlanta, Cincinnati and New York to places like
London, Frankfurt and Paris. It will continue to use extended-range
versions of the 767, as well as the MD-11, on other international
routes.
</P>
<P>
   The airline hadn't planned to get the first 777 until later this
year, but two production slots opened about a year ago, and Delta
took them.
</P>
<P>
   That resulted in a 12-month turnaround from initial order to
first delivery, the shortest time since Boeing began selling the
plane, officials in Seattle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it in record time, and it's a beautiful airplane,''
said Fred Sandow, who oversees Delta's Boeing orders.
</P>
<P>
   Delta already is taking regular delivery of ``next generation''
737s that were part of the order. They are used for on short- and
medium-range domestic routes and will replace aging 727s.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also is developing an extended version of the 767, slated
for initial delivery in May 2000. Delta will use the 767-400 to
replace L-1011s in high-volume domestic routes.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's 1997 Boeing order essentially committed the airline to
the Seattle-based aerospace giant as its sole airplane supplier. It
came just as Boeing encountered much-publicized production problems
that forced it to re-engineer manufacturing processes _ mainly in
the 737 program _ and overhaul management.
</P>
<P>
   Sandow said Delta ``had some concerns'' about Boeing's troubles
after placing the order but has since been satisfied they won't
significantly delay deliveries or hurt quality.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the 777 has been a huge success for Boeing, helping the
company grapple with the increasingly tough competition from
European consortium Airbus Industrie. Boeing has orders for 459
777s, and the program accounts for $9 billion of its $14 billion in
widebody sales.
</P>
<P>
   While the 777 isn't an especially distinctive airplane visually,
it has acquired a more glamorous reputation than any airliner since
the bubble-topped 747, which Delta has long eschewed as too big for
its routes.
</P>
<P>
   The 777 was the first plane designed entirely on computers and
is the first Boing aircraft to use ``fly-by-wire'' technology, in
which controls are operated by electric signals sent from the
cockpit to small motors in the wings and tail, as opposed to
cables.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing allowed PBS to film a documentary on the 777's design and
first flight, adding to popular interest in the model.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exciting plane for us,'' said Mary Alice Shinall, a
veteran Delta in-flight service manager who was part of the Delta
team that worked with Boeing on configuration issues.
</P>
<P>
   She likened it to the 767 bought by employees in 1983 and the
MD-11 painted in a special Olympic livery before the 1996 Atlanta
Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rank it right up there with the Spirit of Delta or the
Olympic plane,'' Shinall said.

COMMENTARY: MILOSEVIC'S CAMPAIGN OF TERROR 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For three days now, on Slobodan Milosevic's orders,
Serbian policemen, soldiers and paramilitary thugs have been
spreading terror across Kosovo. They have burned and shelled
villages, driven thousands of ethnic Albanians from their homes and
carried out dozens of assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the terror campaign has not fully registered in the
outside world because Milosevic has expelled Western journalists
and cut off television links. But enough details have got through
to make clear that a human disaster is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   One example: On Thursday a respected source saw many thousands
of civilians making a forced march from the town of Qirez. Serbian
tanks were behind a column, a mile or more long, of men, women and
children. What happened to them is not known.
</P>
<P>
   A second example: At 1:10 a.m. on Thursday armed men in black
uniforms with Serbian police insignia broke into the Pristina home
of a leading Kosovo Albanian human rights lawyer, Bajram Keljmendi.
His wife said they shouted, ``You have five seconds to come out of
your rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   The policemen ransacked the house, beat Keljmendi and took him
and his two sons away. At daybreak Mrs. Keljmendi went to police
headquarters, where she was told to take her troubles to NATO and
the Kosovo Liberation Army. Friday Keljmendi and his sons were
found shot dead a few miles from Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   A third: Serbian police shot the elderly doorman at the last
Albanian-language newspaper in Kosovo, Koha Ditore, as they shut
the paper down. The publisher, Veton Surroi, went into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has targeted for kidnapping and assassination the top
Albanian editors, lawyers, doctors and educators. The idea is to
decapitate the leadership _ exactly what his killers set out to do
in Bosnia seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Milosevic terror campaign mocks one of the main purposes
given by President Clinton and others for the NATO operation. In
the president's words, that is ``to deter an even bloodier
offensive against innocent civilians in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   If we and our allies did not act, Clinton said, ``President
Milosevic would read our hesitation as a license to kill. There
would be many more massacres _ tens of thousands more refugees,
more victims crying out for revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has, rather, made the NATO operation a license to
kill. The massacres are occurring, and there are tens of thousands
of new refugees. That puts a heavy responsibility on Clinton. He
faces a humanitarian debacle. What should he do?
</P>
<P>
   First, he should support the NATO Supreme Commander, Gen. Wesley
Clark, in his desire to intensify the air attacks. The scale of the
operation so far has been nowhere near large enough to make
Milosevic believe we mean business _ much less to destroy his
military power.
</P>
<P>
   Second, NATO must begin using in Kosovo the aircraft that
operate against tanks and artillery: attack helicopters and A-10
Warthogs. They have been held back because they fly lower and
slower, and hence are more vulnerable to anti-aircraft weapons. But
not using them means giving a free hand to Milosevic in his Kosovo
terror campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the United States has compelling evidence of what
Milosevic is doing in Kosovo: high-resolution photographs from
satellites that show burning villages and shattered houses. We
should publish those pictures to counter Milosevic's tactic of
shutting out the world.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, NATO has to face the fact that more than air power may
be needed to save the people of Kosovo. Clinton and the Europeans
have said that no ground forces would go in unless Milosevic
agreed. But we are beyond that now. We have to think about a
protection force on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy, and it never was going to be. But caving in to
Slobodan Milosevic would be inestimably worse. He is using the
tactics of the Gestapo. His regime increasingly has the smell of
the first fascist state in post-Cold War Europe.
</P>
<P>
   What will NATO celebrate at its 50th anniversary party next
month if it has allowed Kosovo to become a graveyard? What will
become of the humanitarian ideal, of what Clinton called ``a moral
imperative''? One former diplomat said: ``If they don't get
serious, Kosovo will be the humanitarian Bay of Pigs.''

WASHINGTON, March 26 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: KOSOVO
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday passed, 58-41, a resolution supporting
President Clinton's decision to deploy air strikes against Serb
forces in the Kosovo province of Yugoslavia. Supporters said
inaction is unacceptable when innocent people are being killed and
that Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic must be contained.
Opponents said it was too risky of an endeavor and there was no
clear strategy to end the assault. A ``yes'' vote favors the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: SENATE BUD
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 55-44, a $1.7 trillion budget
plan that outlines spending goals for the next year. The plan would
cut taxes over the next several years, help finance the ailing
Social Security system and increase spending for education and
defense. Supporters of the Republican proposal said the bill saves
Social Security while still providing tax cuts and staying within
the parameters of a balanced budget. Opponents said the bill only
provides tax relief to the rich and does not adequately address the
need to save Medicare. A ``yes'' vote favors the proposal.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: EMERGENCY
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 220-211, a $1.2 billion
emergency supplemental spending bill that includes aid for Central
America, farm relief and for Jordan's implementation of the Wye
Peace accords. The measure almost failed, but the Republican
leadership held the vote open until they could lobby enough votes
to pass the bill. Opponents said while they support the intent of
the bill, they were concerned that important programs would be cut
in order to offset the cost of the package. Supporters said it is a
necessary package and therefore the offsets are justified. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: HOUSE BUD
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 221-208, a $1.7 trillion budget
plan that outlines spending goals for the next year. The plan would
cut taxes over the next few years, shore up the Social Security
system by setting aside the Social Security surplus revenue and
increase spending for education and defense. Supporters of the
Republican proposal said the bill saves Social Security while still
providing tax cuts and staying within the parameters of a balanced
budget. Opponents said the bill only provides tax relief to the
rich and does not adequately address the need to save Medicare. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.

`OF FREAKS AND MEN': WINKING AT YESTERDAY'S EROTICA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, Russia)  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A sustained off-color joke directed with high visual
style, Aleksei Balabanov's film ``Of Freaks and Men,'' is extremely
close in mood and attitude to the work of Guy Maddin, the eccentric
Canadian director whose oddball period fantasies have earned him an
enthusiastic cult following. ``Of Freaks and Men'' is also a
striking change of direction by this Russian director, whose film
``Brother,'' a brutally powerful gangster movie set in contemporary
St. Petersburg, was respectfully received when it opened last year.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in orange sepia, ``Of Freaks and Men'' was inspired, the
director has stated, by a collection of vintage erotic photographs
of young women being flagellated. The movie, set in
turn-of-the-century St. Petersburg, takes meticulous pains to
recreate the look and atmosphere of period daguerreotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with today's X-rated fare, of course, the photographs
of women bending over and being roundly but not viciously flogged
on their bare buttocks by a stern nanny seem laughably modest.
Among other things, Balabanov's film, which New Directors/New Films
is screening Saturday night at 9 and Sunday at 12:15 p.m. at the
Museum of Modern Art, is an exercise in cultural and temporal
relativism. Yesterday's naughty erotica, it reminds us with a wink,
is today's quaintly exotic detritus.
</P>
<P>
   Around these old photographs, the director has constructed a
whimsical melodrama about the corrupting influence of erotica on
two interconnected St. Petersburg families, as well as an allegory
on the genesis of Russian movie pornography. Although it is a
talking picture, ``Of Freaks and Men'' uses inter-titles between
scenes and a physically exaggerated acting style to evoke the
silent film era.
</P>
<P>
   The heads of the two households into which the erotic pictures
infiltrate like a poison gas are a railroad engineer (Igor
Shibanov) and the doctor (Aleksandr Mazentsev) treating him for a
heart condition. Among those obsessed with the pictures are the
engineer's daughter (Dinara Drukarova) and the doctor's housekeeper
(Tatyana Polonskaya).
</P>
<P>
   Other characters include the grim, poker-faced pioneering
photographer (Sergei Makovetsky), his fiendish gap-toothed
assistant and smut peddler, Siamese twins (under the doctor's care)
who are temperamental opposites (one is a goody-good, the other a
hopeless drunk) and the doctor's beautiful blind wife (Lika
Nevolina), who becomes a photographic subject.
</P>
<P>
   What does it all mean? Not terribly much. Beyond being a witty,
inventive exercise of historical imagination and cinematic style,
``Of Freaks and Men'' is a movie that remains emotionally locked
inside its own dream world. It is the film equivalent of watching a
vintage tableau vivant re-enacted on a stage: an elegant curiosity.

 &HT;    NATO STRIKES BEGIN TARGETING SERB FORCES, BUT STILL SAYS NO TO

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American-led NATO forces entered a new phase of
airstrikes against Yugoslavia on Friday, increasingly targeting
Serb army and police forces amid growing concern about atrocities
against ethnic Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The subtle evolution of the NATO air strategy came as the White
House sought to end speculation that NATO ground forces would
eventually be necessary to force Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to accept a peace plan for Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians
have been fighting for independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no intention of using ground troops in this
circumstance,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart emphasized
Friday after NATO warplanes shot down two of Yugoslavia's
Soviet-made MiG-29 jet fighters over neighboring Bosnia -- a
dramatic example of how the conflict over Kosovo was spilling
outside the borders of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said allied forces have yet to
determine the intentions of the MiG pilots, but acknowledged that
one possibility was an attack on the 30,000 peacekeeping forces
under NATO command in Bosnia. Those forces include 6,900 Americans
from the 1st Cavalry Division based at Fort Hood, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the third night of NATO bombing against Milosevic,
the heaviest yet in the conflict in ``Operation: Allied Force,'' as
the mission is known, continued to strike Yugoslavia's formidable
air defense system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea, basically, is to try to make the skies as safe as
possible for our pilots so then they can begin concentrating on the
next goal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as we make progress against the air defense system -- and
we have made progress, particularly against its command and control
elements -- we are gradually increasing the emphasis on attacking
targets in Kosovo itself, particularly the Serb army . . . and the
Serb special police,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, one of the two states making up
the current Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon suggested that bombing targets had been ``recalibrated''
as a result of ``very disturbing reports'' of brutality by Serb
forces against ethnic Albanians, including executions of civilians
and the destruction of villages. Although the reports are
unconfirmed, ``there is reason to fear for the worst, and we do
fear for the worst,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin voiced the same concern
earlier in the day, saying the United States is ``extremely
alarmed'' by the reports of atrocities in Kosovo. He noted that war
crimes ``have no statute of limitations'' and that Serb commanding
officers and political leaders could be held responsible for the
actions of subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bombing began three days ago, NATO planes have
concentrated mostly on Yugoslavia's air defense system. At the same
time, however, they have struck at Serb military targets in Kosovo,
including troop headquarters, fuel supplies and ammunition storage
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``As these strikes continue over the following days, we will, as
appropriate, increase the concentration and focus on targets within
Kosovo itself,'' Bacon said. He did not provide any details
concerning about the timing or targeting of the campaign in the
coming days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been very clear from the beginning that our goal is in
fact to degrade Milosevic's ability to continue his predations
against the Kosovar Albanians. And we are turning to that goal,''
he added. ``Whether it's air defenses, whether it's air force --
offensive air force or defensive air force -- whether it's his
ground troops, we are working to suppress them, to whittle them
back, to shrink them down, to make them less potent, and we are
having some impact.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE MINNESOTA TWINS WHO PLAY FOR GEORGIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Ga. N.C., Ohio, Tenn.)   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE , Calif. _ After three years of a Tennessee waltz, you
needed a game program this time around to help with all the new
faces taking their rightful control of the women's Final Four.
Peppi Browne, the Duke defensive ace who chased Chamique Holdsclaw
all the way to the end of her college career, only needed to
distinguish between two.
</P>
<P>
   Her assignment Friday night in the national semifinal against
Georgia was a Miller twin, possibly Kelly, probably Coco, maybe
whoever had the hotter hand. It's a good thing these Duke players
are so academic, so observant, because the only way to tell the
Millers apart is by number, or by freckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelly has one right here that I don't have,'' Coco said,
pointing to her left cheek. Go ahead, Coach. Break that down in
your pre-game films.
</P>
<P>
   In the first game Friday night, it was the so-called Duke Double
against the Miller twins. Would Joe Alleva, the Duke athletic
director, have to return by private jet from the men's site in St.
Petersburg, Fla., for the women's title game Sunday night? Or would
the Millers play on to confuse one last opponent?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was reported recently that there were 17 sets of
twins playing Division I women's basketball this season. None were
as good, or as alike, as the Millers, the 5-foot-10-inch sophomores
out of Mayo High School in Rochester, Minn., who this season each
averaged slightly more than 18 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   This undoubtedly came as no surprise to the researchers at the
University of Minnesota, who, according to Coco, after a one-day
study three years ago found them to be the most corresponding set
of twins they had ever come across.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave us math tests, reading tests, random questions, and
we just about scored the same,'' she said. She smiled and shrugged,
apparently used to such uniformity by now. Their SAT scores were
roughly equivalent. They are both majoring in pre-med, with 3.5
grade point averages. Kelly has produced better statistics during
the tournament, but Coco has Georgia's single-game record of 45
points. In the best game they ever played together, in high school,
they combined for 68 points. Thirty-four apiece.
</P>
<P>
   They have shared clothes, a room, ball-handling
responsibilities. They enjoy the same food. When placed in
different classes after first grade, they confounded teachers at
recess by gravitating to the same friends. When they got on the
plane after their visit to Athens, Ga., they immediately agreed
that Andy Landers was the coach for them.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, he had coached two sets of twins and recognized
that, sooner or later, there had to be some separation, for the
sake of themselves and their team. He focuses on what each does
better. Kelly's rebounding. Coco's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelly is more calculating, taking advantage of what the
defense gives her,'' said Landers, which is why he made her the
point guard. ``Coco is more attack-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Landers is rubbing off on them. On Thursday, practice day,
Coco wore a gray Georgia sweatshirt and blue jeans. Kelly wore the
sweatshirt, with blue jeans shorts.
</P>
<P>
   On the court, no such luck; they wear their hair in ponytails,
with bangs, and sweatbands on the left elbow. Duke's Browne decided
to spend Thursday crunching numbers: Kelly, 23. Coco, 35. The rules
say you can't switch jerseys, a prank they sometimes pull in
practice that always works.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Miller presented the challenge of Holdsclaw, for whom
Browne had been preparing for years against boys, on the black tops
of Akron, Ohio. But Duke needed to handle one of them, at least, if
it was going to keep Alleva from taking Sunday off in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever differences Landers has found in the Miller twins,
about all the Duke men's and women's programs have in common is a
campus and a gym. Shouldn't an enlightened institution of higher
learning and basketball tradition be a tad embarrassed that it took
so long to grow a women's team? Its recruiting budget was a
minuscule $10,000 when Gail Goestenkors took over as coach in 1992.
Now Duke is big-time, doubling its pleasure, trying to survive a
case of double Miller vision.

 &HT;    Holyfield ending `broken' marriage
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Evander Holyfield filed for divorce from his wife,
Janice, on Friday in Fayette County Superior Court, effectively
ending a marriage he has admitted was a mistake from the start.
</P>
<P>
   The filing of the divorce complaint comes six months after
Holyfield publicly admitted fathering two children out of wedlock
during his marriage to Janice Holyfield, his second wife, and two
weeks after Holyfield's stature in boxing was damaged in a disputed
draw with Lennox Lewis for the unified heavyweight title.
</P>
<P>
   Evander and Janice Holyfield have been separated since July and
living in separate houses on the same Fayette County estate.
Neither returned phone calls Friday. Barry McGough, Holyfield's
divorce attorney, also did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thomas, Holyfield's long-time attorney, said, ``Evander
still has the highest regard for Janice, and we are hopeful that
all the issues can be worked out amicably.''
</P>
<P>
   John Mayoue, Janice Holyfield's attorney, declined to comment on
the case ``until after I've had a chance to review the pleadings.''
</P>
<P>
   In the complaint, Holyfield seeks divorce from the former Dr.
Janice Itson, whom he married Oct. 4, 1996; joint custody of the
couple's 6-month-old son, Elijah; and a judgment that would allow
him to keep ``all of his separate property'' and ``an equitable
portion of the marital property.''
</P>
<P>
   The Holyfield's marriage ``is irretrievably broken and there
exists no possibility of reconciliation,'' the complaint reads.
Holyfield also requested a mediator for negotiations and asked that
the details of the settlement remain private.
</P>
<P>
   The Holyfields did not have a signed prenuptial agreement. But
attached to the complaint was a transcript of an alleged telephone
conversation on Oct. 22, 1996, between Janice Holyfield and Thomas,
in which she gives the attorney her approval to an agreement. The
transcript quotes Janice as saying, in the case of divorce, ``I
will agree to a settlement of whatever Evander feels is
equitable.''
</P>
<P>
   A letter stating as much was typed up by the law firm of Long,
Aldridge and Norman. But if Janice Holyfield ever signed it, she
never returned it to Holyfield's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Holyfield said he realized almost immediately
after his marriage to Janice that he did not love her but that the
two went through counseling, at her request, to try to work out
their problems. But soon after, Holyfield resumed his problems with
infidelity, which was a basis for the divorce from his first wife,
Paulette, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, Holyfield impregnated two women, then suggested
to Janice that they divorce ``quietly,'' so she could avoid
humiliation. But she declined and the two remained married.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield said at the time, ``If Janice had said, `Well, let's
go,' it would have made things a lot easier. I thought it would be
better to do it right away rather than wait five years, and then
say you made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The Holyfields stayed married, and Janice became pregnant in
February 1998. Elijah Jedediah Holfield was born Sept. 11. Janice
and the child have been living in Holyfield's older home; Evander
has been staying in the new mansion next door.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield has nine children: three with his first wife Paulette,
one with Janice; and five others with four women out of wedlock.
Paulette Holyfield received a divorce settlement of approximately
$4 million in 1991 after six years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield has grossed $205 million in ring purses in his pro
career, including $92 million for his last five fights during his
marriage to Janice.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield met Janice at a religious crusade in Philadelphia in
1994. The two dated briefly, then and became friends later. In
1996, Holyfield asked Janice, who was practicing medicine in
Chicago at the time, to help care for his children while he was in
training in Houston for a fight against Mike Tyson. It was during
that period that he resumed his relationship with her.
</P>
<P>
   Very few people, even those close to Holyfield, knew about it
when he flew back to Atlanta one weekend in October to marry
Janice. The two were wed by a justice of the peace.
</P>
<P>
   In ensuing weeks, Holyfield asked Janice to take over some of
his business dealings. She oversaw Holyfield Management and, later,
the Holyfield Foundation. She still has voice-mail in the office
but, according to Thomas, no longer works there.

THE FUTURE OF BUSINESS _ AND FINANCIAL JOURNALISM _ IS ELECTRONIC
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, The New York Times Co. (which owns The Boston
Globe) announced that it would expend $15 million in cash and
services to obtain a minority interest in a financial news Web site
called TheStreet.com. News of the Times's investment preceded by
one day the announcement that Goldman Sachs would soon take
TheStreet.com public.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet.com is one of the best financial-news Web sites on the
Internet. Its initial public offering is likely to be a smash hit
on Wall Street. So it is not inconceivable that the Times's
interest in TheStreet.com is purely financial _ make a quick buck
on the IPO and get out just as quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But the more likely scenario is that the Times has considered
the way it does business and the way TheStreet.com does business
and decided that the on-line business model might just be the
future of financial journalism.
</P>
<P>
   The cost structure of on-line journalism, financial or
otherwise, is revolutionary. Gone are the massive expenditures on
paper, ink, and other materials. Gone are the huge printing plants
in cities and towns across a wide geographic area. Gone are the
hundreds of trucks needed to physically ship the finished product
hither and yon. Gone are the motor pools and gasoline depots needed
to keep the trucks rolling. What remains are a few dozen Sun
Microsystems or IBM servers locked away in a basement somewhere,
connecting consumers to the journalistic product.
</P>
<P>
   Once established, Web sites like TheStreet.com are free to
devote the majority of their working capital to editorial concerns.
One of the oldest rules of off-line journalism is that 85 percent
of expenditure goes to circulation and 15 percent goes to
editorial. The new rules of on-line journalism are that 20 to 35
percent goes to marketing, advertising, and distribution and all
the rest goes toward maintaining and upgrading editorial content.
</P>
<P>
   One does not have to be a rocket scientist to ``get'' that
eventually the higher quality editorial product will win out. This
is especially true in the field of financial journalism. People who
have their life savings invested in the bond and stock markets are
highly motivated to gather the best available information about
those investments. News organizations that are able to spend the
most money on editorial will eventually offer the best available
information. It really is that simple.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most on-line journalism is really just off-line
journalism digitally converted for Web consumption. One can read
this column in the Boston Globe newspaper or on the Boston Globe's
Web site, but it's the exact same column. In the next 10 years,
however, on-line journalism will quickly become a journalistic
force unto itself. Nowhere will this be more true than in the
category of business and financial news.
</P>
<P>
   There are three reasons why. First, the technological
infrastructure will be fully operational. Consumers of business and
financial news already are disproportionately techno-capable. Once
the system is up and humming, they'll be even more addicted to its
use. Second, consumers of business and financial news will need and
demand real-time news services. Since they are, by demographic
definition, the most attractive targets for advertisers, they'll
get what they want.
</P>
<P>
   Third, and perhaps most important, the world's financial markets
are likely to merge into one 24-hour-a-day, 7-days-a-week global
supermarket. The New York Stock Exchange has already announced
plans to extend its trading day into the evening. European and
Asian markets would like nothing better than to merge with Wall
Street to create a market available at all times to a global
customer base via the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Once the markets go ``24-7,'' time is altered. Today, US
financial markets open at 9:30 a.m. and close at 4 p.m. Stuff
happens. Journalists write stories about what happened. Editors
check those stories for accuracy, and everybody is home for dinner
by 7 o'clock. The paper is printed later in the evening, delivered
the next morning, but the information contained therein is still
accurate until the opening bell rings at half past nine.
</P>
<P>
   In 24-7 time, however, the market is always open. Stocks that
are selling at $10 a share at 4 p.m. might be selling for $6 at
midnight. In this environment, the newspaper version of business
and financial news is literally untenable. Who would read a stock
table page based on information that was eight hours old?
</P>
<P>
   In this environment, the only place to get business and
financial ``news'' would be on the World Wide Web. Off-line
reporters are quite literally out of business. The only people who
can cover this brave new world are on-line journalists, because
they are the only ones who are technologically capable of providing
accurate information in real time.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers today are divided up into sections. The one section
that will be completely transformed by technology in the next 10
years is business. By the year 2010, it won't be all the business
and financial news that's fit to print. It will be all the business
and financial news that's fit to double-click.

PRECOCIOUS ACTRESS IN A `MOD' MODE 
</HEADLINE>
 (Corrects name of TV show in 2 9 th graf to ``My So-Called Life'') 
For use Sunday, March 28 by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES _ Claire Danes has always seemed wise beyond her years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the unusually self-aware high schooler she played on the
ahead-of-its-time TV dramedy ``My So-Called Life'' to the smart,
sensitive teens she's created in such films as ``Home for the
Holidays,'' ``Little Women,'' ``Romeo + Juliet'' and ``To Gillian
on Her 37th Birthday,'' Danes has specialized in girls who act
markedly more mature than most of the adults around them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just shy of her 20th birthday, Danes is doing one of pop
culture's key kids in a grown-up world. She's Julie Barnes in the
big-screen version of ``The Mod Squad,'' that shaggy '60s TV show
in which three young hippie types worked for the Establishment as
undercover cops.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which is set on the fringes of contemporary L.A. club
culture, stars Danes in the old Peggy Lipton role as a recovering
addict, Giovanni Ribisi (``Saving Private Ryan'') as messed-up rich
kid Pete Cochrane and Omar Epps (``Scream 2,'' ``Higher Learning'')
as cool-but-smoldering Lincoln Hayes. All three characters have
traded potential jail sentences for badges (but not guns).
</P>
<P>
   The movie is the latest in a long line of '60s TV retreads, and
it opened Friday to witheringly negative reviews. But the
perceptive and articulate Danes has good reasons for taking on what
she saw as another in a hoped-for continuing series of new
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the most dramatic turn I've taken,'' admits the
waifish blonde, a New Yorker who, at the tender age of 10, began
studying at the prestigious Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute. ``But
it was a really good time. And I think it's important to tackle
different genres and explore the boundaries of film.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it was so much a product of its Generation Gap era, many
have deemed ``Mod Squad'' impossible to update. But Danes believes
that director Scott Silver found a way to make it resonate for
today's youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really focused on the alienation of the characters, which
the TV show only briefly touched on,'' she notes. ``I think that's
extremely relevant to our society today. People feel very
disconnected from each other and are seeking a community that they
can feel a part of. These characters find that in the Squad.''
</P>
<P>
   According to director Silver, Danes' very participation was key
to creating the ``Mod Squad'' film community.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Claire comes aboard, it becomes a different movie,'' he
says. ``She's such a classy actress, and other actors really want
to work with her. And she's an incredibly gifted actor, incredibly
honest, open and natural. She's such an accomplished and mature
actress ... And she's been doing this a lot longer than I have,
which was intimidating in some sense. But she was great to work
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-star Ribisi echoes those sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so beautiful, intelligent and precocious _ I just hate
her!'' Ribisi jokes. ``No, it was really a pleasure and an
opportunity to work with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone has nice things to say about Danes, the one
glaring exception being the Philippine government. After a grueling
experience filming the still-unreleased prison drama ``Brokedown
Palace'' there, Danes complained to the media about conditions in
the island nation. She was subsequently declared persona non grata
by the Manila City Council, which also banned showings of her films
in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go there,'' Danes replies when asked about the
controversy. ``It's so grim, that whole thing. I don't want to talk
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   While that sounds like a typical Hollywood dodge, it's atypical
of Danes. She tries very hard to avoid the usual movie star airs
and actorly pretensions. Indeed, her biggest fear is becoming
cocooned in show-biz hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most destructive part of being an actress in this business
is that you're constantly shielded from spontaneity and real-life
experiences,'' she observes. ``You have a really strong team
(agents, managers, publicists, etc.) that serves as a pretty
impenetrable fortress, and I think that's unfair to a person. It's
really easy to become quite stagnant in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Danes' solution?
</P>
<P>
   ``I ditch 'em!'' she cracks. ``I live in New York, I go to
school, I have a network of friends who are entirely unrelated to
the business. The majority of my friendships are with people like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   She makes one major exception to that rule, however. Danes
shares her New York apartment with Australian singer-songwriter Ben
Lee. The couple has been together for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so in love it's disgusting,'' she jokes. ``My boyfriend's
just a sweetheart. He's really funny, he's really smart, and he
loves me really, really well. That's a quality that people take for
granted; I mean, it's a skill, and not everybody's capable of doing
it. I think that's the most critical quality.''
</P>
<P>
   How old is this girl? Under 30, maybe. But under 20?
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Danes is a freshman at Yale, the alma mater of
her friend and mentor Jodie Foster (plans are in motion for Danes
to star in Foster's next directing effort, the circus story ``Flora
Plum''). When attending classes, she lives in a campus dorm with a
roommate. It's all part of her ongoing effort to lead as normal a
life as she can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I function on campus pretty well,'' she reports. ``People who
meet me are immediately disillusioned and are not awkward around
me. It's people who are on the periphery of my social world who
sometimes behave in strange ways because they're into me or
threatened by me.''
</P>
<P>
   Danes also tries to put an anti-egghead spin on her Ivy League
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking a pretty eclectic group of classes. Graphic design,
which is my favorite; an English class; child psychology; women's
health, which is surprisingly boring; and computer science; and the
modern intellectual agenda _ fancy title, not so intimidating.''
</P>
<P>
   Most typical of Danes' college experience so far: no time for
fancy movie star diets and exercise plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of my remain-slim routines have gone right out the
window,'' she says with a laugh. ``I am so inert! And I consume
copious amounts of utter junk.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know, it's been fine. It hasn't had any negative
effect on the way I look. I've realized I was unnecessarily
neurotic about food and things _ because I was encouraged to be.
It's important to be in tune with your body; exercise is really
critical in being a well-rounded person. But it's important, of
course, not to overdo it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who remember Danes' dead-on perfect portrayal of teen
angst in ``My So-Called Life'' will be happy to hear that she's
outgrown at least one girlish neurosis. This could mean there's
hope yet for Ally McBeal, Felicity and all the other popular,
self-analyzing TV characters whom Danes' short-lived, pioneering
series inspired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually really flattered that all of these shows are
somewhat derivative of `My So-Called Life,''' she says. ``I have
actually never seen `Ally McBeal' or `Dawson's Creek' or `Felicity'
_ I am totally stupid about pop culture, which is pretty ironic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people were quite untrained to view our show when it
came out,'' she adds. ``They weren't accustomed to being so
confronted by a show, and it was very demanding. But people still
watch it on cable television and video. It's definitely had a
trickle effect.'' &QL;

BUSES CONTRIBUTE TO DUDLEY SQUARE'S HIGH RATE OF ASTHMA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A tiny swatch of open space outside Dudley Square _ just a
median strip, really _ has come to symbolize the fastest-growing
political movement in Roxbury.
</P>
<P>
   There, a tidy memorial is dedicated to Walter Reid Kirnon, a
14-year-old Fort Hill boy who died of asthma in 1996. Many of his
neighbors believe he was a victim of the air pollution that chokes
the neighborhood daily. And they believe the Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority is ultimately to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the MBTA's 970 diesel-fueled buses are housed in or near
Dudley Square, serving a community that relies on public
transportation, but also, residents believe, contributing mightily
to the highest incidence of asthma in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   While the causes of asthma are complex, there is growing
agreement that pollution plays a significant role, along with
deteriorating housing stock, poor access to health care, and other
environmental factors. According to city health statistics,
hospitalizations for asthma are 11.2 per 1,000 residents in
Roxbury, more than five times the statewide average of 2.1 per
1,000 residents. Even MBTA officials acknowledge that the diesel
buses contribute to the high rate of asthma in Roxbury.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting Monday with MBTA officials, residents will once
again ask Massachusetts to join New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and
Cleveland in modernizing its bus fleet by gradually phasing out
diesel in favor of buses that run on alternative fuels, such as
compressed natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of six groups _ including Alternatives for Community
and Environment, the Bowdoin Street Health Center, the Egleston
Square Neighborhood Association, the Committee for Boston Public
Housing, the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group, and the
Union of Concerned Scientists _ has organized residents to call on
the T to cut emissions in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided that we wanted to focus on diesel buses, in
particular, because we, as the bus riders and taxpayers, pay for
that system,'' said Penn Loh, associate director of Alternatives
for Community and Environment. ``It makes no sense to pay 60 cents
for a system that's polluting us and choking us.''
</P>
<P>
   If coalition members expect the T to pull the buses off the
road, they shouldn't hold their breath. They can probably look
forward to vague promises and pledges, with no due date, backed by
little political will, if the state responds as it has in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The MBTA has taken some tentative steps to reduce pollution: The
400 diesel buses it has purchased in the past four years run as
much as 85 percent cleaner, and buses are idling less, reducing
exhaust. But those steps fall short of what is needed.
</P>
<P>
   T officials might have a greater sense of urgency if they spent
some time talking to Tamika Davis, a 15-year-old who lives near
Dudley Square, in the area city health officials refer to as
Boston's ``asthma belt.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamika would tell them she is treated at Boston Medical Center
approximately every other month for a condition that seems to
worsen the more she travels around her neighborhood. Despite a
regimen that includes pills, inhalers, and a nebulizing machine,
Tamika's capacity to breathe has steadily worsened.
</P>
<P>
   Ask her what she thinks the cause is, and Tamika says simply,
``It's probably the buses and the pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Herzenberg, deputy chief operating officer of the MBTA,
says the agency accepts the notion that its buses are serious
polluters whose emissions damage the health of residents. But at a
cost of $250,000 per bus, the agency has no plans to just abandon
diesel buses, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The MBTA has agreed to a small pilot project to determine what
alternative fuel source it should consider in the future. But
Herzenberg made it clear that the current diesel buses will run
until they can't any longer, which means the T will likely operate
diesel buses for almost another decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our buses are only four years old,'' Herzenberg said.
``We're not going to throw them out. We're going to get the useful
life out of these buses.''
</P>
<P>
   That's pathetic. The MBTA owes more to the health and quality of
life of those it serves than to simply shrug at disease and death,
while its officials blandly quote figures from a balance sheet. The
technology to end this environmental outrage exists. It's time for
Massachusetts to finally take advantage of it.

 &HT;    Traffic stop nabs Gray
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hawks backup guard Ed Gray, arrested Thursday on a
number of traffic violations, faces suspension if found guilty of
charges of driving under the influence and possession of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Results from an April 27 court appearance will determine Gray's
fate. If he is found guilty, Hawks general manager Pete Babcock
said, the team would seek ``the harshest'' penalty permitted
against Gray under the recently negotiated collective bargaining
agreement. NBA spokeswoman Teri Washington said the degree of
punishment is at the team's discretion, meaning that the Hawks
could suspend him for part or all of the season. The club also
could decide to release him.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the 76ers' Allen Iverson and then-Trail Blazers
Isaiah Rider and Clifford Robinson _ Robinson is now with Phoenix _
were involved in marijuana incidents, and their teams did not
suspend them. However, commissioner David Stern intervened and
sidelined them from one to three games.
</P>
<P>
   Babcock sounded as if he would not need Stern's persuasion in
punishing Gray, 23, who also would have to receive treatment and
counseling under the NBA's marijuana program. Gray will fly to New
York on Monday to meet with NBA security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts are the facts,'' Babcock said. ``I met with the team
and with Ed individually, and I told them both that when you're a
member of the family, we'll help you, whether it's legal help or
counseling. At the same time, however, if he's found guilty, I told
him that he'll be penalized in the harshest manner allowed under
the new (labor agreement).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious, serious issue. When you're talking about a
DUI, you're talking a blatant disregard for other people's lives,
because you put other people's lives at risk. We're very surprised
and extremely disappointed and concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   A state trooper stopped Gray's 1991 BMW about 8 p.m. Thursday
near downtown Atlanta after noticing that the car's windows were
tinted darker than state law allows and that his California tags
had expired, spokesman Gordy Wright of the Georgia Department of
Public Safety said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He said the trooper found in the car less than an ounce of
marijuana and an open container of alcohol. In addition to drug
possession and DUI, he said, Gray was charged with driving with an
open container of alcohol and driving on a suspended and revoked
license. Blood-alcohol tests are pending.
</P>
<P>
   Gray had no comment Friday after the Hawks' shoot-around for
their game with Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, a 1997 first-round draft pick making $866,600 this season,
was suspended four games and fined a total of $57,000 last year for
being late for games and practices and for missing medical
appointments during rehabilitation after foot surgery. This season,
he was late for practice just once, but his history, the
seriousness of the pending charges and the fact that he has had a
poor season so far _ shooting 25 percent from the floor _ could
place his Hawks career in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Gray is the third Hawk recently to run afoul of drug laws. In
1996, point guard Mookie Blaylock pleaded guilty to possession of
56 grams of marijuana in a Vancouver suburb and was given absolute
discharge by the court.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, former backup center Greg ``Cadillac'' Anderson
pleaded guilty to one count of possession of cocaine with intent to
distribute.

DUKE'S BURGESS CONSIDERING UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Duke sophomore and Orange County native
Chris Burgess confirmed Friday that he has considered transferring
to UCLA after the season but won't make a decision for at least
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of talk about it,'' Burgess said. ``It
might go through my mind. But right now, I'm not thinking about it.
It's a burden. It's a stress, and we don't need that distraction.
We'll see, whatever the future holds.''
</P>
<P>
   Burgess, who is Mormon, ruled out Brigham Young as a possible
destination but said he'd consider Utah and/or a church mission.
</P>
<P>
   Asked specifically about UCLA, he said: ``Sometimes I think
about it, because it's been a frustrating year.''
</P>
<P>
   Burgess, a 6-foot-10 forward/center, is averaging 16 minutes per
game. His best friend is UCLA manager Jason Tilton, a former
teammate at Woodbridge High in Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   He hinted that his future may hinge on two factors: whether Duke
center Elton Brand stays in school or bolts for the NBA, and
whether highly touted recruit Carlos Boozer signs with the Blue
Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Boozer, a 6-8 forward, is also considering UCLA and St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   Scoonie's secret: Ohio State junior guard Scoonie Penn has shown
no effects of sitting out last season after transferring from
Boston College. Averaging 17.1 points, Penn was named Big Ten
Player of the Year and third-team All-American.
</P>
<P>
   He scored 48 points in two games in the South Regional in
Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   ``His approach to practice really helped him,'' said second-year
Buckeyes coach Jim O'Brien, who was at Boston College with Penn.
``We told him, `Treat your practices like your games. Try to win
every situation.' That's what happened. In practice, he was playing
with three or four walk-ons, and they'd beat our starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also think his familiarity helped. He was much more familiar
with what we wanted to do than the kids who had been here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hello, again: Duke and Michigan State played Dec. 2 in the Great
Eight in Chicago. The Blue Devils, who had lost to Cincinnati four
days earlier, jumped to a 17-2 lead and held on for a 73-67
victory.
</P>
<P>
   What effect will that game have today? After coming so close,
the Spartans probably think they can win. Then again, Duke knows to
be wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a much different team,'' Michigan State coach Tom Izzo
said. ``We're a lot better than we were, and they're a lot, lot
better than they were.''
</P>
<P>
   The first-timers: Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski is making his
eighth Final Four appearance. O'Brien, Izzo and Connecticut's Jim
Calhoun are making their first.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as if it's an advantage or not, I don't know,''
Krzyzewski said. ``What I learned is you can't do everything for
for all the people that ask of you. You have to do as much as
possible for the people who are closest to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaskan connection: Duke senior Trajan Langdon is an Anchorage
native who attended grade school with folk singer Jewel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a biology class together, lab partners for a
semester,'' Langdon said. ``I guess it was my sophomore year (at
Duke), and Mateen (Cleaves, of Michigan State) came up to me and
said, `Do you know Jewel? She's from Alaska.' I was shocked she had
gotten to the level she had.''

SPRING IS AS GOOD A TIME AS ANY TO TAKE A WALK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can't quite say that spring comes to Eastern Massachusetts.
It comes, then goes, comes again and then probably goes again _ by
which time, it's summer.
</P>
<P>
   It's still early in the season, and it could still snow. But it
also could turn sunny and 55. And, as Henry Lee of the Friends of
the Public Garden says, ``it's sometimes good just to see a few
signs of things to come.''
</P>
<P>
   So, after four months of frost, it's time to slip outside to
seek the early bloom of the season, whether in its coming or going
mode. The perfect early spring walk requires some planning. You'll
want a sheltered walk to keep the elements at bay; a gentle one,
because the days themselves can still be rugged enough; and a
close-at-hand walk in case the weather shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Covering those criteria, here are six early spring walks, most
recommended by the people who know them best:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: The Public Garden
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit thin now,'' says Lee, but there should be a good
show of crocuses and daffodils this weekend, and there is still
some color in the witch hazels along Beacon Street. It's not really
a place for wildlife (the best known in the garden is man-made: the
swan boats, due back in mid-April, and the ``Make Way for
Ducklings'' sculpture), but Lee says to keep an eye out for
red-tailed hawks. ``We have three or four all the time,'' he says.
``They go after the squirrels and pigeons.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: The closest T stop is Arlington on the Green
Line.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Boston Parks Department. 617-635-7381. Free.
</P>
<P>
   QUINCY/MILTON: Blue Hills Skyline Trail
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge,'' admits MDC Ranger Maggi Brown (9 miles,
start to finish, over some rough terrain), but this is the best
time of year to make the hike, or part of it _ precisely because
the best views from the hilltops are now, before the trees begin to
leaf out. On a clear day you'll see Wachusett Mountain, some 40
miles to the west, and Mount Monadnock, some 80 miles to the
northwest. And there may be turkey vultures in the sky overhead.
``They're fun to watch,'' says Brown. ``They tend to soar a lot and
stay in one spot so you can watch them for hours _ so bring a
lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Park at either end, at the Shea Rink on Willard
Street, Quincy, or by Houghton's Pond near the MDC Headquarters on
Hillside Street in Milton.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Metropolitan District Commission. 617-698-1802.
Free. Maps available at headquarters 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH NATICK: Broadmoor Wildlife Sanctuary
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a place where you can come and walk in undisturbed
nature,'' says Elissa Landre, sanctuary director of the
Massachusetts Aubudon Society. In the next few weeks, a new
overlook at the sanctuary's vernal pond will be an attraction. The
skunk cabbage is just coming up, and in the pond there may be wood
ducks, along with bugs and beetles, and perhaps painted turtles
basking in the sun. Overhead, Landre says, the spring bird
migration is on, and ``there's something new turning up every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: 280 Eliot St., South Natick, 1.8 miles west of
South Natick Center on Route 16. Visitor Center open 9 to 5
weekdays, 10 to 5 weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Massachusetts Audubon Society. 508-655-2296 or
781-235-3929. Free to Audubon members, $3 for nonmember adults, $2
for nonmember children. Maps available at Visitor Center. No dogs
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   HINGHAM: World's End Reservation
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the greatest spot this time of year,'' says Michael
Tougias, author of ``Nature Walks in Eastern Massachusetts'' and
``More Nature Walks in Eastern Massachusetts.'' The winds off the
ocean are ``getting balmy after the winter chill,'' and there may
still be some sea ducks lingering before they head offshore. A
favorite spot for Tougias is the cliffs on Rocky Neck, which juts
out into the Weir River. And, he says, ``there's a `big sky'
feeling when you walk out on the drumlins.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: From Route 3A at the Hingham Rotary, east 0.3
miles on Summer Street, left on Martins Lane. Open dawn to dusk.
Warning: Parking is tightly limited.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Trustees of Reservations: 781-821-2977. Free to
trustees, members, and children under 12, $4 for adults.
</P>
<P>
   GLOUCESTER: Ravenswood Park
</P>
<P>
   There's a scenic hike here. And, if there's an early spring
snow, there could be good cross-country skiing and snowshoeing
along the 10 miles of trails and carriage roads maintained by the
Trustees of Reservations. The trails provide views of Gloucester
Harbor to the east as they cross through fields of glacial
erratics, or boulders, a glimpse into the last glacial retreat from
the Massachusetts coast. The trail through Great Magnolia Swamp
leads into the northernmost locale of sweet bay magnolia (from
which the neighboring village of Magnolia gets its name).
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Off Western Avenue. Two miles south on Route 127,
from the junction with Route 133. Open dawn to dusk.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Trustees of Reservations: 978-356-4351. Free.
</P>
<P>
   PRINCETON: Wachusett Mountain
</P>
<P>
   Time for making plans. There may be a few early hawks migrating
north already, but large groups probably won't arrive before
mid-April, according to Paul Roberts, head of the Eastern
Massachusetts Hawk Watch. Most common are broad-winged hawks, and
the best times for watching are mornings when there's a southwest
wind. The best viewing is from the ledges near the overlook on the
southwest side of the mountain, reached by a trail (a little over a
mile, and steep in places) from the Department of Environmental
Management's Visitor Center. Along the trail, look for spring
wildflowers just coming into bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: From Route 2, take Route 140 south 3.7 miles to
Mile Hill Road. Follow the road past the ski area to the Visitor
Center.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As NATO forces stepped up their missile assault
into the daylight hours, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia
maintained fierce resistance Friday both on the ground and in the
air. Two of his MiG-29 fighters were shot down on what NATO claimed
was a foray into neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The sweep by Serb troops through the ethnic Albanian villages of
Kosovo continued unabated, NATO said, despite the third straight
day of air assaults that NATO officials claimed were succeeding and
would remain unrelenting until Milosevic accepted peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that there is intensified fighting,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said of the Serbian campaign against the
Kosovar separatists. Unconfirmed reports of civilian atrocities
continued as refugees from the ethnic Albanian majority fled
Kosovo, Serbia's southernmost province, with tales of increasing
anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   In the airstrikes, a series of explosions rocked the outskirts
of Belgrade Friday night, with NATO officials saying the target
list was being broadened specifically to include bunker positions
of the Yugoslav military hierarchy in the Belgrade area as well as
army and police outposts in Kosovo. NATO officials said even more
severe assaults would follow.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton sought to appeal directly to the Serbian
people in a televised statement in which he denounced Milosevic.
``He has diminished your country's standing, exposed you to
violence and instability, and isolated you from the rest of
Europe,'' Clinton declared in a broadcast translated into
Serbo-Croat. ``Right now he's forcing your sons to keep fighting a
senseless conflict that you did not ask for and that he could have
prevented.''
</P>
<P>
   The downing of the two MiGs inside Bosnia by two U.S. F-15C
fighters raised the question of whether Yugoslavia was attempting
to extend the conflict and involve neighboring nations.
Administration officials said the planes were shot down from a
four-plane group that violated Bosnian air space. They crossed the
western border of Serbia and were presumed to be heading
aggressively toward NATO peace-keeping ground troops in Bosnia. The
American interceptors were not from the NATO assault force but
rather part of the Bosnia peace-keeping patrols.
</P>
<P>
   The two losses, combined with earlier hits, means that by the
Pentagon's count Milosevic has already lost a third of his premier
air armada of 15 MiG-29s, highly rated Soviet fighter planes
designed for both air-to-air and air-to-ground combat. In a
subsequent incident, two MiG-21s crossed over Bosnia but retreated
before they could be intercepted, NATO said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an act of desperation,'' State Department spokesman
James Rubin said of the MiGs' incursion, characterizing it as
evidence of Milosevic's frustration at the NATO assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the Clinton administration issued a warning
to Milosevic that any evidence of atrocities in Kosovo would be
presented to war-crime investigators of the International Tribunal.
The tribunal has opened an investigation focusing on Milosevic's
role in the atrocity-ridden Balkan wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is extremely alarmed by reports of an
escalating pattern of Serbian attacks on Kosovar Albanian
civilians,'' Rubin said. ``We are using our national technical
means to observe events in Kosovo and are prepared to share that
information,'' he added, referring to satellite and aircraft
surveillance photo records that could eventually be consulted in
investigating specific allegations of atrocities. One NATO official
said intelligence agents as well were on the ground in Kosovo,
trying to track Milosevic's troops as they routed and attacked
ethnic Albanian villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of even more concern,'' said NATO's Supreme Commander Gen.
Wesley Clark, ``Are the so-called paramilitary forces, including
gangs of hardened criminals which have in the past and are
apparently now being employed in ethnic cleansing operations
against the Kosovar Albanian population.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said the growing violence was exemplified
by such refugee reports _ not yet confirmed independently _ that
Serb forces executed 20 ethnic Albanians in the village of Goden
and were systematically targeting male civilians of fighting age.
</P>
<P>
   The third day of NATO's attack included the first daylight
strike, although the brunt of the assault came at night as sirens
once more braced the population of Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital.
In mid-afternoon, an American cruiser, the USS Philippine Sea,
fired two cruise missiles from the Adriatic. The missiles struck
what officials described as ``a target of opportunity'' _ military
aircraft spotted at an air base _ that had presented itself but was
not part of the day's plan. Explosions rocked the southwestern edge
of Belgrade shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   As dark fell over Yugoslavia, the main thrust of the attack
began. Air-launched cruise missiles fired from B-52s based in
England struck, followed by waves of fighters based in Italy,
including F-117 ``stealth'' fighters.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, Kosovo has been a sacred province in Serb
nationalist history, but 10 years ago, after Serbs slipped into the
minority and ethnic Albanians became the overwhelming majority,
Milosevic stripped the Kosovars of their autonomy. Last year, he
opened an aggressive military campaign against them as they sought
to regain self-rule. After agreeing under international pressure to
a peace plan last fall, the authoritarian Serb leader resumed his
ethnic cleansing attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The reports of atrocities put more pressure on NATO to broaden
its raids beyond air-defense and communications installations and
focus on the Yugoslav forces than have been attacking the ethnic
Albanians. Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said American and NATO
forces were ``gradually focusing'' their strikes on army and police
units in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Clark said the strikes were
methodically following a plan that emphasized air defenses, but
also included strikes at the army and police headquarters. NATO
released a list showing damage to army headquarters or barracks in
Danilovgrad in Montenegro, Kursumilja in Serbia and Urosevac,
Prizen and Pristina in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right on track with the plan,'' Clark said in the
interview. ``We're already attacking these headquarters, attacking
command centers.'' He said it was ``entirely predictable'' that the
Serbian campaign against villages would intensify with the NATO
assault.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Pleurat Sejeu, a spokesman for the Kosovo Liberation
Army, claimed that Serb forces were using warplanes against
villagers and had rounded up thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees
in the central Drenica region for a forced march toward the Kosovo
capital, Pristina. With human rights and foreign news workers
severely restricted in Serbia, there was no independent
confirmation of his claim.
</P>
<P>
   One senior NATO official conceded frustration at the Serb
paramilitary units accused of carrying out atrocities. ``We cannot
from the air do anything about these people,'' he said. ``But they
are protected by the Yugoslav armed forces and we can do something
about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the NATO assault claimed a diplomatic victory at
the United Nations when the Security Council rejected, 12-3, a
Russian resolution that the airstrikes be ended. China and Namibia
voted with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said that NATO officials
should be tried as war criminals. ``Those who have unleashed the
aggression against Yugoslavia must be prosecuted under criminal
law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Russia said it would send humanitarian aid to
Yugoslavia and no longer cooperate with the United States on the
Y2K problem. The cooperation primarily consists of Western advice
to the Russians on how to fix their computers and related missile
problems for the millennium. To punctuate the official anger, the
chief of Russia's military, Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, refused to pick
up the phone when he received a call from Gen. Henry Shelton, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   In Kiev, Ukrainian officials announced a Yugoslav peace
initiative. But American diplomats said it was a unilateral move
motivated by domestic political factors that is unlikely to come to
much.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgrade government has denounced the NATO raid as
``neo-Nazism,'' with Milosevic calling it an intrusion into an
internal civil war and a pretext to subvert the liberty of
Yugoslavia. In Belgrade, the government has claimed ``minimal
damage'' from the NATO attacks in reporting at least a dozen people
killed and scores wounded. But Milosevic's U.N. ambassador,
Vladislav Jovanovic, claimed ``hundreds of civilians'' had been
killed in the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb campaign against the ethnic Albanians has seen more
than 2,000 killed in the last year, with hundreds of thousands of
Kosovars driven from their homes, according to U.N. refugee
officials.
</P>
<P>
   In the administration's attempt to subvert Milosevic by
appealing directly to the Serbian people, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright also taped a broadcast, speaking in the
Serbo-Croatian language that she learned as a child when her father
was a diplomat in Belgrade. ``Americans do not hate Serbs,'' she
said. ``Like me, they remember that we were allies against
facism.''

KEVORKIAN CONVICTED OF 2ND-DEGREE MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ Dr. Jack Kevorkian, who claims he has helped
more than 130 people to commit suicide, was convicted Friday of
murder for giving a fatal injection to a man with a terminal
illness.
</P>
<P>
   It was a trial that people on both sides of the assisted-suicide
debate believe will have a profound impact on future discussion of
this contentious, emotional subject now that the most visible and
controversial proponent of euthanasia and assisted suicide could
spend much of the rest of his life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian, 70, was convicted in the death of Thomas Youk, a
52-year-old man from a Detroit suburb, who suffered from
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease. Prosecutors
had originally charged Kevorkian with first-degree murder in Youk's
death. First-degree murder involves premeditation, but the jury,
which deliberated for 13 hours, returned a verdict of second-degree
murder, which does not.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian faces a minimum sentence of 10 to 25 years in prison
on the murder charge. Kevorkian, whose medical license has been
revoked in Michigan, also faces up to seven years in prison on a
second charge, delivery of a controlled substance.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian reacted impassively as the jury read its verdict,
blinking several times as he looked toward the jury box. Released
on bond until sentencing in mid-April, he declined to speak with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   This was the fifth time in a decade that prosecutors had tried
Kevorkian for his role in the deaths of seriously ill people. Three
trials ended in acquittals, while a fourth ended in a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases, Kevorkian was charged not with murder but with
violating laws against assisted suicide, for helping people to use
a contraption called a ``suicide machine'' to give themselves fatal
injections. Juries in those cases had been swayed by emotional
statements from the families of the dead, who defended Kevorkian's
actions as compassionate.
</P>
<P>
   But this trial was different because prosecutors had unusually
direct evidence: a videotape Kevorkian made of himself injecting
Youk with lethal chemicals last September. Kevorkian brought the
tape to the CBS News program ``60 Minutes,'' which broadcast it in
November, along with an interview in which Kevorkian dared
prosecutors to file charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   Because Kevorkian was charged with murder, the judge instructed
the jury that the issue of whether Youk consented to his death was
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we knew it wasn't, was it wasn't assisted
suicide on trial,'' said a juror, a young man who would not
disclose his name. ``That was unequivocal. I mean we knew why we
were there.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``what it came down to was the evidence proved
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a strikingly short trial in which Kevorkian insisted on
defending himself, betraying his lack of legal skill as he asked
legally impermissible questions and failed to persuade the judge
that his proposed witnesses were relevant to the case. Likening
himself to such heroic figures as Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa
Parks, he appealed to the jury to send a message that laws against
euthanasia and assisted suicide were unjust.
</P>
<P>
   The same juror, the only one of the 12 who would speak to a
reporter, said the jury was not influenced by Kevorkian's
self-representation. But he said: ``There wasn't much defense. All
we were left with was the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   The juror said that he perceived Kevorkian to be telling the
jury, ```Here's the tape. Now make a decision as to whether
assisted suicide is going to go on.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that wasn't what that was about,'' the juror said.
``We knew it was about the facts, we knew it was about a murder
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian's lawyer, David Gorosh, said the defense would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is certainly unjust to try to equate an act of
compassion with an act of murder,'' Gorosh said. ``What he did was
a complete act of mercy. He was invited into the Youk home. Tom
Youk requested help, and he was suffering.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Prosecutors had originally charged Kevorkian with assisted
suicide as well as murder, but they dropped that charge when Judge
Jessica Cooper ruled that the defense could present testimony about
Youk's pain and suffering with an assisted-suicide charge and not
with a murder charge.
</P>
<P>
   John Skrzynski, the lead prosecutor on the case, said the
decision to drop the assisted-suicide charge, considered a huge
gamble at the time, ultimately proved successful.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Youk's wife and brother could not testify and,
apart from the videotape, which showed how much Youk was suffering
when he was alive, no testimony was presented about Youk's painful
condition and his apparent desire to end his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trials in the past were always emotionally based,''
Skrzynski said. ``We tried to put it on a legal playing field, not
an emotional playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   After the trial, Youk's wife, Melody, and brother, Terrence,
hurried out of the courthouse without speaking to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The trial attracted people with strong passions about assisted
suicide and euthanasia, both supporters and opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Faye Girsch, executive director of the Hemlock Society, was
dismayed by the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``To call it murder is barbaric,'' she said. ``It highlights the
necessity to change the law all over the country and in the world
so that a compassionate physician can help a suffering patient
die.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Coleman, the founder and president of a group of disabled
people who have given themselves the name ``Not Dead Yet,'' was
heartened.
</P>
<P>
   She said the euthanasia movement was ``very threatening to a
disabled person,'' and added, ``I hope this will send a message
that this steamroller has got to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Skrzynski was asked after the trial if he felt this would
silence Kevorkian, who has been flamboyant and outspoken in his
advocacy of euthanasia and assisted suicide, sometimes in ways that
alienated people who might be inclined to support his position on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silence him?'' Skrzynski said. ``I think as a practical matter
he'll go to prison and you know, prisoners don't usually have press
conferences. And I think he's going to be surprised that he's not
going to be able to maintain the public interest in the media that
he's gotten in the past once he becomes a prisoner. In a way he
kind of silenced himself by doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorosh said Kevorkian's views would ultimately be vindicated and
``Dr. Kevorkian will be lauded as a hero in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, Judge Cooper, who was patient with
Kevorkian's legal stumbling, implored him to allow himself to be
represented by lawyers. He refused, saying he felt he could express
his views to the jury better.
</P>
<P>
   But once the jury began deliberating, Gorosh, frustrated because
he was relegated to whispering advice to Kevorkian during the
trial, said he told his client, ``'There's nothing left for you to
argue here. These are legal issues that are better served by
lawyers who are experienced.'''
</P>
<P>
   So on Friday, Kevorkian asked Judge Cooper if his lawyers could
represent him from then on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now?'' the judge asked, before granting his request.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian has said he would starve himself if sent to jail, and
both Gorosh and prosecutors said Friday that they hoped that would
not happen.
</P>
<P>
   Skrzynski was asked if he had created a martyr. He replied, ``I
created an inmate.''

THOUGH WARY ON INFLATION, FED LIKELY TO LEAVE RATES UNCHANGED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve is almost certain to leave
interest rates unchanged when its policy-making committee meets
Tuesday, but the central bank remains wary of resurgent inflation
because of the economy's continued strength, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   With overall price increases negligible and growth appearing to
slow a bit from the blistering pace at the end of 1998, the Fed has
no rationale for an immediate rate increase, economists say.
</P>
<P>
   But the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee, meeting
for the second time this year, may move toward adopting a policy
bias favoring higher rates _ a tilt that would put financial
markets on warning that a rate increase might be in the cards in
coming months. Still, analysts put the chances of the Fed adopting
a tightening bias next week at well under 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed is absolutely on hold,'' said Bank of America chief
economist Mickey Levy. ``While the economy is strong and the
unemployment rate very low, inflation remains low and increases in
wages have actually diminished,'' Levy said. ``Then there are the
international considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   The global financial crisis that prompted the Fed to cut rates
three times in quarter-point increments last fall has eased
considerably. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said in congressional
testimony in February that the improved situation in the markets
could eventually justify taking back some portion of those rate
reductions.
</P>
<P>
   But Brazil's stabilization is tenuous, and Fed officials are not
convinced that Japan's economic slide has bottomed out. So the Fed,
analysts say, remains wary about the effects on the rest of the
world of a rate increase in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, it is the economic weakness in much of the rest
of the world that is keeping the United States from overheating.
The monthly trade deficit hit a record of nearly $17 billion in
January, meaning that a growing volume of imports and declining
exports are taking some of the pressure off domestic producers.
</P>
<P>
   The hit from trade appears to be enough to slow the overall rate
of growth in the economy, analysts said. Moreover, higher interest
rates over the last month are beginning to slow the main engine of
the expansion these days _ consumer spending _ in part by cooling
what had been a red-hot housing market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be some concern about the pace of domestic
spending,'' said Robert DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Smith
Barney. ``Yet it's quite plausible that market forces themselves
will bring about some kind of tempering without any active role
from the Fed.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still a debate within the Fed over the reasons behind
the unusual combination of robust growth and stable prices. On one
side are those who say the economy is simply benefiting from a
confluence of temporary factors that are holding down inflation for
now. On the other is a faction that thinks something fundamental
has changed to allow higher rates of noninflationary growth than
traditional models would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Those who see the current combination of strong growth and
dormant inflation as temporary point to the recent rise in oil
prices as evidence that what had been an unbroken string of good
news for the economy will not last forever.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of Fed officials seem to have fallen in
line with Greenspan in giving serious consideration to the idea
that huge investments in technology over the last decade may have
helped to tame inflation by improving productivity, or output per
worker.
</P>
<P>
   The economy expanded at a 6.1 percent annual rate in the fourth
quarter of last year, matching the fastest quarterly pace of the
1990's. While it appears to have slowed somewhat in the first few
months of this year, the economy is still growing at a pace that in
the past would have been expected to generate higher inflation,
economists said, especially with unemployment at just 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, faced with a similar situation, the Fed decided to
move to a tightening bias in late March. It retained that bias
until August, when Russia's debt default rocked global financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, Fed officials seem more comfortable with
allowing the economy some leeway, especially since there is
virtually no inflation. The Consumer Price Index rose just
one-tenth of 1 percent in each of the last three months and just
1.6 percent over the last year. Although oil prices are spiking up
after a sharp drop, prices in other areas are likely to remain
stable. And wages, although rising, are not gaining ground fast
enough to be a serious inflationary threat, largely because
productivity has been growing at a faster pace, too.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a recent speech, Robert Parry, president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and one of the Fed's chief
inflation hawks, appeared more open to the idea that the economy
could grow faster without generating more inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it's too soon to say for sure whether the productivity
surge is temporary or permanent, two pieces of evidence do seem to
point to a fundamental shift in productivity,'' Parry said.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said, the phenomenal pace of consumer spending _ it
grew 5.25 percent in 1998 _ appears to reflect an assumption among
individuals, based on what they see happening at their own jobs,
that their incomes will continue growing.
</P>
<P>
   The second piece of evidence, Parry said, is the collective
judgment of the stock market, which seems to think that companies
can continue generating strong profit gains.
</P>
<P>
   David Orr, chief economist at First Union Capital Markets,
observed that at least half a dozen Fed governors and bank
presidents have made statements in recent weeks expressing
confidence that inflation is contained.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than I can remember in the past,'' Orr said, ``they seem
to be comfortable that if inflation is going to pick up it's not
going to be sudden or anything they're behind the curve on.''

 COMPUTER HACKER SENTENCED TO 46 MONTHS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kevin D. Mitnick pleaded guilty Friday to computer
fraud and wire fraud in a plea agreement that will result in a
sentence of 46 months.
</P>
<P>
   Given the time he has spent in prison and time off for good
behavior, Mitnick could be released as early as a year from now,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick's lawyer, Donald C. Randolph, said Mitnick could be
released to a halfway house as early as the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick has been in prison since February 1995, when he was
captured in North Carolina after being on the run more than two
years. During that time, according to what Mitnick admitted Friday,
he broke into computers, intercepted computer communications and
stole proprietary software from several cellular telephone and
software companies. Often, he called up the target company
pretending to be an employee in order to get passwords and access
to the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Mitnick will not be able to use a computer
or cellular phone for three years after leaving prison without the
permission of his probation officer.
</P>
<P>
   He also agreed to surrender proceeds from publications, movies
or other commercial ventures related to his crimes for seven years
after his release.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer accepted the plea
agreement but left open the question of how much money Mitnick
would have to pay in restitution to victims of his crimes and to
the government.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it would seek millions of dollars, while
Randolph argued there should be no restitution because Mitnick
would have limited abilty to earn money.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a dark suit in court here, the 35-year-old Mitnick
looked more like an investment banker than the teen-ager who once
stayed up nights prowling the electronic networks.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mitnick, the defendant's father, said he was ``ecstatic''
about the agreement. Mitnick himself is relieved and ``can now see
light at the end of the tunnel,'' Randolph said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Mitnick still faces California charges stemming from
separate accusations of computer fraud. No trial date has been set
for the state charges.

U.S. TO BACK THE CENSURE OF BEIJING OVER HUMAN RIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The administration announced Friday that it would
sponsor a U.N. resolution next month condemning Beijing for what
the resolution calls the wholesale violation of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Last year President Clinton decided to drop Washington's
tradition of sponsoring such a resolution at the U.N. Human Rights
Commission annual meeting in Geneva, arguing that China's behavior
was improving and that seeking a public rebuke was
counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter China signed the International Convention on
Civil and Political Rights, which commits Beijing to guaranteeing
freedom of expression, assembly and religion.
</P>
<P>
   But so far China has not ratified the convention, and as the
economy has slowed and protests have erupted, the government has
imprisoned more dissidents and cracked down on all efforts to
organize political opposition.
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said Friday that in
the past year, ``China's human rights record has deteriorated
sharply.''
</P>
<P>
   The new resolution was announced less than two weeks before
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji is to arrive here for an official visit.
The trip has already become intertwined with Washington's
intensifying debate about nuclear spying, soaring trade deficits
and China's efforts to win American approval for entry into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, rarely has the administration's policy of separating
trade and human rights been starker than today: even as the State
Department was making its announcement, American and Chinese
negotiators were trying to fashion a deal on China's membership in
the trade group in time for Zhu's arrival in Washington, which is
scheduled for April 8.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials insisted Friday that their decision to
go ahead with the resolution condemning China was driven chiefly by
China's crackdown on dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   But, speaking on condition of anonymity, they readily
acknowledged that it was also linked to the increasing hostility
toward China on Capitol Hill, where the questions of its rights
record and fitness to join the trade organization seem inseparable.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Congress have threatened to block China's entry. By
sponsoring the resolution condemning China, the White House hopes
to argue that it is using the Geneva forum to try to punish the
Chinese _ without punishing American exporters or others doing
business with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense that the president has to show Congress he can
get tough,'' one administration official said, ``without sinking
the whole relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department did not release the wording of its proposed
resolution Friday, but if the past is any guide, the measure stands
little chance of passage. Since their introduction in 1990, a year
after the shootings at Tiananmen Square, similar resolutions have
consistently been defeated.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That reality _ along with politically symbolic gestures by the
Chinese in 1998, including the release from jail of Wang Dan and
other prominent democracy advocates _ led the administration to
decide last year to skip the ritual at the Geneva meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But the environment has radically changed. Economic troubles
have brought on anti-government protests in China. The State
Department's rights report, released last month, condemned Beijing
for a new wave of repression.
</P>
<P>
   But even then several administration officials said they thought
the report alone might serve to register Washington's protest. They
hinted that the United States might again forgo sponsoring a
resolution. In a foreign policy speech last month, Clinton
suggested that China was ``moving away from the rule of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, however, unanimously passed a nonbinding resolution
calling for a condemnation of China at the Geneva meeting, which
began this week and will continue through April. And the
administration, a senior State Department official told reporters
Friday, concluded that was the only realistic choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having chronicled the facts and the deterioration,'' the
senior official said, ``we had no choice but to go ahead with the
resolution as part of our strategy of engagement on human rights.''

RELIGION COLUMN: DISCORD OVER NATO ATTACKS ON YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Polls show Americans are divided over the decision this week by
the United States and other NATO members to bomb military targets
in Yugoslavia. It is a division that also extends to religious
organizations, even as many of those organizations echo the concern
voiced by the NATO governments over the Yugoslav military's attacks
on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province, the situation that led to
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Since the air strikes began, the church world service committee
of the National Council of Churches has called for an end to the
bombing, as has the Roman Catholic peace organization Pax Christi.
</P>
<P>
   Some American Muslims, as well as leaders of social action
groups within Reform Judaism, have backed the NATO action as a way
of pushing the Yugoslavs to a peace agreement with the Kosovo
Albanians, many of whom are Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   As if noting the division, the president of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, Bishop Joseph Fiorenza, said in a
statement that disagreement among ``persons of good will'' may be
inevitable. While attempts to protect the Kosovo Albanians from
further violence was a legitimate goal, he wrote, ``What is less
clear are the consequences of the use of force.''
</P>
<P>
   But few religious organizations are likely to feel the
conflict's complexities as acutely as the World Council of
Churches, which is comprised of more than 300 Protestant and
Orthodox Christian churches. Member churches can be found in
countries on both sides of the conflict _ in Yugoslavia (and its
dominant state Serbia), in Russia, whose government has strongly
denounced the NATO air strikes, and in the NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the air strikes began, the council's general
secretary, the Rev. Dr. Konrad Raiser, dispatched a pastoral letter
to the heads of three Yugoslavian churches, expressing the
council's ``solidarity'' with them and stating that only a
negotiated peace could be ``a durable and just'' one.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from the council's headquarters in Geneva by telephone
Thursday, Raiser said the organization was not interested in
assigning blame for the conflict, but instead wanted to express
concern for its victims and to explore possible avenues to peace.
</P>
<P>
   The council's governing Assembly met last December amid
well-publicized internal tensions, when some Orthodox members
complained their concerns were being disregarded in an organization
where Protestants form the majority. Dr. Raiser said that, as far
as the council is concerned, the conflict in Yugoslavia is not
helpful to relations among churches in these two branches of
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an Orthodox perspective, it is at least conspicuous that
the main powers involved in the NATO action are, of course, powers
shaped by a predominately Protestant ethos,'' he said, referring
primarily to the United States, Britain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Raiser said the council wanted to call attention to religious
voices within Yugoslavia that do not share their government's
militaristic attitude. He said those voices have not been heard
widely enough.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he cited a public statement Thursday by Patriarch
Pavle, head of the Serbian Orthodox Church, the largest Christian
organization in Yugoslavia, in which the patriarch called for an
end to the bombing, for negotiations to end the crisis and for
Yugoslavian and Serbian authorities ``to do everything so that
peace may be established.''
</P>
<P>
   The patriarch serves as president of the church's Synod of
Bishops, a body represented last week at an interfaith meeting on
peace in Kosovo by Bishop Kyr Artemije, who comes from Kosovo. The
meeting, organized by New York Rabbi Arthur Schneier's Appeal of
Conscience Foundation and held in Vienna, produced a declaration
asking for peace and tolerance in Kosovo that was signed by Bishop
Artemije and two other Kosovo religious figures, Roman Catholic
Bishop Marko Sopi and Professor Quemal Morina, vice dean of the
Faculty of Islamic Studies in the Kosovar city of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The document, written at a time of gradually escalating violence
between the Yugoslav military and Kosovo Albanians, called for an
end to the killing and establishment of a ``viable system'' to
represent the province's people, without violating any minority's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the fighting ends,'' said Rabbi Schneier, ``you will need
a force that can re-connect the community, and this is where
religious leaders can play an important role.''
</P>
<P>
   Raiser said the council had supported the meeting and the
declaration. ``I think we should take their voice seriously,'' he
said.

 &HT;    Riding the bench proves vital lesson
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Duke's Elton Brand would rather not think
of the Blue Devils' 73-67 victory against Michigan State on Dec. 2.
It was, after all, pretty embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's 6-foot-8, 260-pound sophomore center was anything but a
dominant force that night in Chicago. Woefully out of shape, at
least by coach Mike Krzyzewski's standards, Brand was helpless as
Michigan State pounded Duke on the offensive boards, 25-5. Brand
had only three rebounds and committed six turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't in the best of shape, I know that,'' Brand said. ``As
a team, we weren't in good shape either. We couldn't get a rebound
at one point.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke won the game, but Krzyzewski was not happy with his budding
star. Three games later he benched Brand and told him to shape up
or expect to get less playing time.
</P>
<P>
   It turned Brand's season around.
</P>
<P>
   In tonight's Final Four at Tropicana Field, Michigan State will
see a much different Elton Brand than the one who dragged his tired
body around the United Center on Dec. 2. Brand, Duke's leading
scorer and rebounder (17.8 ppg, 9.6 rpg) has become the best big
man in college basketball and a major reason why the No. 1 Blue
Devils are 36-1 and favored to win the national championship. He
will, said Michigan State coach Tom Izzo, be a load for the
Spartans to handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question that Elton is playing a lot
harder and a lot better than he did back in December,'' Izzo said.
``He is really something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his benching by Krzyzewski in December, Brand has played
the game with a greater sense of passion. He hit the stationary
bike several times a day until he got into good shape. Over the
past two months he has been virtually unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   Since an eight-point outing against Wake Forest on Jan. 13,
Brand has scored in double figures in 20 consecutive games. In that
stretch he has also had 11 double-doubles.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Brand returned to Chicago to play DePaul on Feb. 24,
he was a star, scoring 20 points and pulling down 14 rebounds as
the Blue Devils won easily 96-64.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot from that period,'' said Brand, who was chosen
Associated Press Player of the Year on Friday. ``I learned that I
have to be in shape or I'm going to miss easy shots. It was a very
important lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski warned his team Friday not to think too much about a
game that was played almost four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're better but they're a lot better too,'' said Krzyzewski,
in his eighth Final Four at Duke. ``It helps because we know how
big they are and how they play, but that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand will play better today, said Krzyzewski, but so will
Michigan State point guard Mateen Cleaves, who was held to 3-of-17
shooting on Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two best players are in a lot better shape now than they
were then,'' Krzyzewski said. ``It's like two totally different
teams and so anything can happen.''

 &HT;    Point men crucial component of all Final Four teams
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ All four teams in today's NCAA Final Four
have at least one thing in common: An exceptional player at point
guard who is significantly responsible for them being here.
Coincidence? Not at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you have a great point guard to run your team and be an
extension of the coach on the floor, you're not going to get
here,'' Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said. ``A great point guard
makes all the other players on the floor better. And these four
guys certainly do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Izzo should know. With the Midwest Regional championship on the
line last Sunday against Kentucky, Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves
took control with two 3-pointers that led the Spartans to a
73-66victory.
</P>
<P>
   Duke has two All-Americans in its starting five but the MVP for
the 36-1 season has been sophomore guard William Avery, whose speed
and quickness breaks down even the best defenses. Even Elton Brand,
the national player of the year, said Avery is the key to the Blue
Devils' success.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State went from 8-22 a season ago to the Final Four through
the sheer force of Scoonie Penn's will. The Buckeyes' leading
scorer made big play after big play in the 77-74 victory against
St. John's for the South Regional title.
</P>
<P>
   UConn's Khalid El-Amin had one of the worst games of his career
(0-for-12 from the floor) in the West Regional championship against
Gonzaga. But he made the free throws down the stretch and ran the
offense while the Huskies protected the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the game is on the line, the ball has to be in their
hands,'' UConn coach Jim Calhoun said. ``They are guys with nerves
of steel. And we'll have four great ones out there Saturday
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Football friends
</P>
<P>
   Some say Michigan State plays the game with the fierceness of
football. That should not be a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo is a former football player and coach and most of the
team's top players, including Cleaves, are former high school
football players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it gives us a toughness that we really need,
especially playing in the Big Ten,'' Cleaves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football coaches, I think, are really good at getting the most
from the players they coach,'' Izzo said. ``I like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad timing
</P>
<P>
   Our vote for the most frustrated player this weekend? That would
be Michigan State's Mike Chappell, a transfer from Duke. Chappell
left Duke after playing 54 games after it became obvious he would
not get a lot of minutes in the future. He had to sit out this
season and thus cannot play Saturday. He had to pay his expenses to
get to Florida but will be allowed to work out with the Michigan
State team.

 &HT;    Huskies depending on Moore's ability to adjust
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Ohio State is in the Final Four because
it has one of the nation's best backcourts. In fact, Scoonie Penn
(17.1 ppg) and Michael Redd (19.7 ppg) are responsible for 49
percent of the Buckeyes' offense each game.
</P>
<P>
   For Connecticut's Ricky Moore, that fact meant a late Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be doing a lot of film watching,'' the senior
guard said Friday afternoon. ``A lot of film watching.''
</P>
<P>
   For UConn to beat Ohio State in tonight's Final Four, Augusta's
Ricky Moore must have a very good game.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Moore, UConn's 6-foot-2 defensive stopper, will start
on Penn, the Buckeye point guard who shared Big Ten Player of the
Year. But if Redd gets hot, Moore will have to switch.
</P>
<P>
   He has a track record of success in stopping the opponent's top
player:
</P>
<P>
   _ In last week's West Regional championship victory against
Gonzaga, Moore held high-scoring Matt Santangelo to 1-for-9
shooting, and UConn won 67-62.
</P>
<P>
   _ After Miami's Johnny Hemsley scored 18 first-half points
against the Huskies on Jan. 20, Moore took over. Hemsley went
scoreless in the second half, and UConn won 70-68 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   _ On Dec. 5, Moore forced Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves, the
other Big Ten Player of the Year, to miss 13 of 15 shots in a 82-68
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my 27 years as a head coach, I've never had a kid who could
cut the head off a dragon like Ricky,'' UConn coach Jim Calhoun
said. ``When he is playing well, he thinks he is worth 20 points a
game, and I agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore didn't come to UConn as a defensive specialist. After
leading Westside High to a 33-1 record and a state championship in
1995, Moore became the starting point guard at UConn as a
sophomore, averaging nine points a game.
</P>
<P>
   But last season, UConn signed Khalid El-Amin and gave him the
starting job at point guard. Moore moved to shooting guard and
never complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Khalid came in, I knew I would have to do some different
things, but I didn't have a problem with it,'' said Moore, who has
been the team's co-captain the past three years. ``I knew he was
going to give us another option on offense, and I thought that was
important to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky is the perfect example of the kind of kids you have to
have in your program in order to win,'' Calhoun said. ``He was
asked to change his role and has done a magnificent job.''

 &HT;    Ozaki leads, but Duval looms in 2nd
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ It's a mirage. Everybody knows it.
Japan's Joe Ozaki is in the lead after 36 holes of the Players
Championship, but David Duval is in control.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing promises to be easy for the weekend, that is, unless
they replace the billiard felt on the surfaces that are passing for
greens at the TPC at Sawgrass. But if a tough task gets tougher,
the smart money might go on the Jacksonville native who lives just
down Highway A1A, plays the TPC at Sawgrass year round and has
nearly as much confidence as money in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Duval, who fashioned a 3-under-par 69 Friday and is one
shot behind Ozaki at 6-under 138, tries to downplay his comfort
zone, don't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, they don't keep this golf course like this _ hard and
6-inch rough,'' Duval contended Friday. ``I don't have any
advantage that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Ozaki _ this is Joe, not Jumbo _ who shot a 68, the
second-lowest score of the day, and is at 7-under 137, isn't
feeling too secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I was sitting in the same chair, with the same score
and I ended up in 18th place,'' Ozaki said. ``Being the halfway
leader doesn't mean a whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   It might in Duval's case. Certainly, there are enough
indicators. He has enough friends in the gallery to fill a high
school football stadium in Jax Beach. He knows the spots in Pete
Dye's sadistic layout where you can still miss the green and make
par. Heck, maybe this is the week Duval and his father, Bob, both
win. The old man shot a 61 on the Senior Tour Friday to lead by
four shots at the Emerald Coast Classic in Milton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about that?'' the younger Duval said. ``He clipped me by
eight. ... I don't think that golf course is as hard, though.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly a two-man race, however, for the $900,000 first
prize at Sawgrass. Bruce Lietzke, 47, who hardly ever plays on the
PGA Tour but always seems to contend, also shot a 68 and stands two
shots back at 139. Joining Ernie Els (67) and Curtis Strange (69),
Sea Island's Davis Love III is three behind at 140 on a pair of 70s
and sounded like man who would take two more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in good position with two days to go,'' said Love, the
tournament's 1992 champion, ``because I don't think it's going to
get any easier out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods is four shots back at 141 after a 1-under 71.
First-round co-leaders Brian Watts and Bob Estes both shot 74s and
are at 142.
</P>
<P>
   Love can't seem to get through a tournament without a glitch or
two. He bogeyed his last two holes Thursday. He lost ground Friday
with a double bogey at the 12th, taking two pitches to navigate a
mound in the rough. When players eventually got to the greens, they
were Augusta-like in their speed and difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're right on the edge, that's for sure,'' Love said, ``but
that's where they want them.''
</P>
<P>
   The cut came at 4-over 148, pushing out Atlanta's Stewart Cink,
Lee Janzen, Greg Norman, Tom Lehman, Bay Hill winner Tim Herron and
Ben Crenshaw. John Daly withdrew because of a sore hip.

FBI INTERVIEWS CHINESE MAN IN SPY CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI has found and questioned a Chinese
researcher in connection with the inquiry into China's suspected
theft of American nuclear secrets from the Los Alamos National
Laboratory, government officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher, a Chinese man who worked at Los Alamos for
several months in 1997, was located by the the bureau on Thursday
at Pennsylvania State University, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher, who is not under arrest, is being questioned
about his work with Wen Ho Lee, a Taiwan-born American computer
scientist at Los Alamos who was dismissed this month for security
violations. Law-enforcement and intelligence officials said Lee
remained a suspect in the theft of data related to the design of
America's most advanced nuclear warhead.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese man, whose name officials did not release, worked
for Lee from May to September 1997 at Los Alamos as a postdoctoral
researcher. After working with Lee, the researcher returned to the
University of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI lost track of him in the later stages of its
investigation into Lee. Officials did not say how long the
researcher had been at Penn State, which is at State College, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said they were not sure whether the researcher
had played a role in Chinese atomic espionage at Los Alamos, near
Santa Fe, N.M. But the FBI wanted to question him to see whether
his role needed further scrutiny. ``They are taking what he says
and seeing if it tracks with the facts,'' said one official.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has had questions about the researcher's relationship to
Lee since he arrived at Los Alamos. Lee hired him in the spring of
1997, when Lee was given a sensitive new job even though he was
already suspected of being a spy. The FBI opened its investigation
in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the furor over the Clinton administration's
handling of evidence of Chinese atomic espionage, the decisions to
appoint Lee to the new post in 1997 and to allow him to hire a
Chinese citizen as an assistant have raised troubling questions
about the procedures that lab officials and the FBI followed.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau approved Lee's new assignment, assuring the Energy
Department, the lab owner, that it would seek a secret wiretap to
monitor Lee's telephone conversations. But the Justice Department
rejected the wiretap request, arguing that the evidence in the case
was too old to justify it.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said they believed that secrets related to
the W-88 miniaturized nuclear warhead were stolen in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the FBI was in the midst of its investigation, the
bureau was not told in advance that Lee had been allowed to hire
the Chinese man. After the bureau learned of the hiring, it
investigated the assistant.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry found no connection between him and Chinese
intelligence, and the Los Alamos management gave assurances that
the assistant would be restricted to work in unclassified areas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lee had access to both classified and unclassified
materials in his new job, officials now say. Lee still held a
so-called ``Q clearance,'' giving him access to American nuclear
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's new job was to improve historical nuclear codes to
evaluate weapons performance more reliably. It was part of the
``stockpile stewardship'' initiative to ensure that the weapons
inventory could be safely maintained without further nuclear
testing.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, a few months after Lee had started in his new
position, the FBI director, Louis Freeh, told senior Energy
Department officials that the bureau did not have enough evidence
to arrest Lee but that he could be removed from his position
without harming the investigation, officials said. Still, Lee was
allowed to keep his job and retain his clearances for more than a
year after the meeting with Freeh, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Lee was finally polygraphed by the Energy
Department in connection with the spy investigation. Los Alamos
officials nearly returned him to his job and reinstated his
security clearances after they had been told that he had passed the
test, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But after the results from the first lie-detector test were
analyzed further by experts, the results appeared to show deceptive
answers. The FBI administered a second test last month, and Lee's
answers were determined to be deceptive.

ROMAR SAYS SAINT LOUIS JOB `A COACH'S DREAM'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lorenzo Romar said last month he would leave his
job as Pepperdine's head men's basketball coach only if an offer
was ``very, very special.''
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity to coach in a bigger conference and get a
reported annual raise of $375,000 was a special situation. Romar
was introduced as the new head coach at Saint Louis University on
Friday, one day after interviewing for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``This, to me, is a coach's dream,'' Romar said in a press
conference. ``I said it would take something pretty special to make
me leave Malibu.''
</P>
<P>
   Romar, who coached the Waves for three seasons, was making
$125,000 at Pepperdine. His SLU deal, for a reported six years,
would call for an annual salary of $400,000, including shoe and
TV-radio deals.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine's 65-61 loss at Colorado on March 11 in the National
Invitation Tournament was the Waves' first postseason appearance in
five years. Even though Romar's overall record was sub-.500
(42-44), Pepperdine was 36-23 over the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a tremendous privilege for me to work at
Pepperdine the past three seasons,'' said Romar, who was en route
to Tampa, Fla., to attend the NCAA Final Four, in a statement.
``The Pepperdine program is moving forward and the future looks
bright. Pepperdine is a special place, and I will be forever
thankful for the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   John Watson, Pepperdine's athletic director, said he had mixed
feelings about losing Romar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt disappointed but I also felt good for him,'' Watson
said. ``Lorenzo is an amazing man. He was so much in harmony with
what we are trying to achieve here.''
</P>
<P>
   Romar's departure might have been surprising but the cupboard is
not bare. The new coach will inherit a team that lost two
significant seniors _ Jelani Gardner and Marc McDowell _ but
returns everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin Gibbs, a West Coast Conference Honorable Mention
selection, has two more years. Tommie Prince, the WCC's Defender of
the Year, is a former Proposition 16 player who is expected to gain
an extra year of eligibility through academic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Top recruit Kevin Bradley, a 6-foot-1 point guard from Compton
who is attending Irvine Valley College, is expected to start right
away as a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   Who will be the choice as the 10th head coach in the 61-year
history of the program? Watson said he received 11 faxed resumes
Friday from a coaching pool with ``a variety of qualifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine assistants Randy Bennett and Darwin Cook both asked
Watson to be considered for the job. UCLA assistants Michael Holton
and Jim Saia are also reportedly interested.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said the search should take about two to three weeks.

JEAN GUITTON, 87, PHILOSOPHER AND AUTHOR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jean Guitton, a French Catholic philosopher and author and a
friend of popes and French presidents, died Sunday in Val-de-Grace
Hospital in Paris. He was 97 and had homes in Paris and in
Bellegarde-en-Marche, France.
</P>
<P>
   Guitton, a layman, held university professorships in Montpellier
and then Dijon. Later he was a professor of the history of
philosophy at the Sorbonne. He was named a member of the
prestigious French Academy in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Le Monde said on Tuesday that Guias ``the last of the great
Catholic philosophers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Haunted by the confrontation of faith with modern rationalism,
he advocated a reconciliatory Christianity and kept company with de
Gaulle, the popes, the Marxists and the agnostics,'' the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
   He was admired in France for combining a penetrating
intelligence with a powerful faith, and he managed to be friends
with the Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser; Francois Mitterrand,
France's first Socialist president, and Pope Paul VI, who led the
church from 1963 to 1978. On the day Paul VI died, he asked Guitton
to read aloud to him from a children's catechism the professor had
written that emphasized hope and kindness.
</P>
<P>
   Guitton was said to be the only layman authorized by the pope to
be an observer at the first session of the Second Vatican Council.
A French journalist, Henri Fesquet, observed in November 1962,
``Guitton is very much at home on the observers' bench since he has
long been interested in ecumenical problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Guitton was a disciple of the French philosopher Henri Bergson
(1859-1941), who won the 1927 Nobel Prize for Literature. In
Bergson's dualistic philosophy, man's intellect enables him to
appraise the world, and his intuition tells him something of the
all-pervading life force, or elan vital.
</P>
<P>
   After imbibing basic religious and ethical principles, Guitton
was able to square his Catholic faith with the teachings of science
and history in his day. He became an ardent advocate of ecumenicism
and embraced the idea of an Englishman, the second Viscount
Halifax, of uniting the different churches through what the
viscount called a ``corporate union.''
</P>
<P>
   As The Independent put it on Tuesday in London, in its obituary
of Guitton, he ``regarded himself as a true `free thinker,'
insisting that `Catholic' meant `universal.' He believed that all
the church's present troubles, since the Second Vatican Council,
were caused by the extinction of the mysterious and mystical
aspects of liturgical prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Guitton's writings ranged from fiction to criticism to essays
and other works and included ``The Spiritual Genius of St.
Therese'' (1997).
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Saint-Etienne, the son of an industrialist. He
earned a university degree in philosophy and taught in secondary
schools early in his career.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate family members survive.

PROWLER PILOT DESCRIBES MISSION OVER YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE BARBER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's a 29-year-old EA-6B ``Prowler'' Navy pilot out of Whidbey
Island (Wash.) Naval Air Station. Thursday night, under a clear sky
and bright half-moon, he spent four hours in the dangerous skies
over Yugoslavia and Kosovo jamming Serbian radar.
</P>
<P>
   His radio call sign is ``Tool.'' While military officials at
Aviano Air Force Base in Italy vouch for his identity, the
seven-year veteran can't give his name or discuss strategic details
for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   It was quiet in the darkened, two-man cockpit as the plane flew
over Yugoslavia, he said in a phone interview. Little radio chatter
was a good sign as the plane jammed Serbian radar, providing an
electronic shield to armed fighters and bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Prowlers are not heavily armed, but are among the first planes
sent in during an attack. Their job is to confuse enemy
communications and radar, providing cover for attacking planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quieter it is the better,'' Tool said. ``On the radio you
hear threat warnings, whether there is surface-to-air, or
air-to-air missiles. There are certain things you want to hear, but
you want it to be quieter. If you hear very little, it means things
are going well.''
</P>
<P>
   The warnings typically come from friendly surveillance or other
planes, relaying information about anti-aircraft missile sightings,
or enemy aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Tool flies one of three Prowlers with VAQ 134 squadron of
Whidbey's Electronic Attack Wing.
</P>
<P>
   Each prowler carries four aviators, a pilot and three electronic
countermeasures officers. Nearly 200 maintance and support people
from Whidbey also are in Aviana to keep the planes flying.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, the attack missions over Kosovo and Yugoslavia
were going better than expected, he said. Military officials, who
feared casualties from the vaunted Russian-made air defense system
employed by the Serbs, said it was mysteriously absent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected more (anti-aircraft missiles) than we're seeing,''
Tool said. ``Maybe they're holding back, maybe they aren't, and a
lot of it is that we're doing a good job. The missions are
well-planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Tool's best defenses are primarily the confusion he can wreak on
an opponent, and the protection of friendly fighters. The Prowlers
are used by Navy and Marine pilots to provide a protective umbrella
to fighters by jamming opposing radar and communications. They can
travel at 575 mph, cover 1,150 miles, reach a ceiling of 37,600
feet, and carry complex, long-range electronic warfare equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Tool's Whidbey Island Prowlers are joined by others from the
Marine Corps Air Station at Cherry Point, S.C., and faster U.S. and
Canadian Air Force jamming planes, evidence that serious attention
is being paid to the Serb's air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The jets are among more than 130 Air Force, Navy and Marine
fighters, support planes, and cargo aircraft at Aviano as part of
the 31st Air Expeditionary Wing.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Tool said, the squadron was ``on the hook'' for
similar missions in Iraq, but was called back halfway over.
</P>
<P>
   Crew members focus on getting the job done efficiently and
safely, he said, though when there's a break, thoughts drift to
loved ones back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss my wife and family,'' he said. ``We're doing great and
tell everybody our spirits are high. So far we've had no particular
difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the group only flew into Aviano last Sunday, there's been
little time to find a niche in which to relax, he said. Some make
use of the base gym to work out, but most spend time planning,
believing preparedness best minimizes the risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it continues along, then we will find other things to do,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like every American, some flyers have strong opinions about
their role and about the potential for the conflict to escalate.
</P>
<P>
   ``But frankly, we're so concentrated on the mission that that
stuff doesn't play into it,'' he said. ``We're just here to do it
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking to myself as I was flying (to Kosovo) Thursday
night that it was like all the exercises I've ever done in
training,'' he said. ``You never know how good your training is
until you get into the actual situation. But all the stuff we heard
on the radio (in the cockpit) and the procedures have been pretty
much the same as we practiced them at Nellis Air Force Base.''
</P>
<P>
   Tool, who has been with the Whidbey based Prowler squadron for
2-1/2 years, said he's felt fear come and go, depending on how busy
he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most nervous I was was yesterday, before we started,
during the briefing,'' he said. ``But then you start doing your
pre-flight checks and the familiar takes over, and the training
kicks in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a certain amount of time to get down (to the attack
areas in Yugoslavia) from Aviano, so you have some time to think
about it. As you get closer, you think about it. But then you get
too busy to be scared.''

W.F. BRINGLE, 85, ADMIRAL AND AVIATOR

<P>
   Adm. William Floyd Bringle, a highly decorated aviator who
commanded naval air forces in Europe and the Pacific in World War
II, died March 19 at Scripps Memorial Hospital in San Diego. He was
85 and lived in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Bringle, who was born in Covington, Tenn., graduated from the
U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1937 and completed flight
training at the naval air station in Pensacola, Fla., in 1940. He
was a dive bomber pilot and a squadron commander in the invasion of
Italy in 1943 and southern France in 1944, and later took part in
the landings on Leyte Island in the Philippines and on Iwo Jima and
Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   He was awarded the Navy Cross, second only to the Medal of Honor
for valor, as well as the Distinguished Flying Cross with five gold
stars and the Croix de Guerre.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, after serving as an aide to the superintendent of the
Naval Academy, he returned to sea as the executive officer of the
aircraft carrier Hornet.
</P>
<P>
   In the early stages of the Vietnam War, Bringle commanded
Carrier Division 7, a part of the Pacific Fleet whose
fighter-bombers raided enemy targets in South Vietnam and North
Vietnam. He then commanded the air forces of the Seventh Fleet,
which saw combat as part of the Pacific Fleet, and later led the
air forces of the Pacific Fleet, which comprised nine aircraft
carriers, 1,600 combat and support aircraft and 85,000 military and
civilian personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Bringle received his fourth star in 1971 and became chief of
U.S. naval forces in Europe before retiring in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement he spent several years in Britain working
for two aircraft companies, Grumman International and Lear Siegler.
</P>
<P>
   Bringle is survived by his wife of 60 years, Donnie Godwin
Bringle; a daughter, Lynn Riegle of Thompsons Station, Tenn., and a
son, Donald G., of San Diego.

B-2 BOMBS USE BOEING-MADE GUIDANCE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   America's B-2 stealth bombers that are being used in combat for
the first time this week over Yugolslavia are carrying special
2,000 pound bombs fitted with a Boeing-built guidance system that
can hit a target even in bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   This is also the first time that the bomb guidance system, known
as the Joint Direct Attack Munition, or JDAM, has been used in
combat.
</P>
<P>
   The cheap strap-on kit that turns dumb bombs into smart ones
could be worth as much as $5 billion in military sales to Boeing
over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the plan is for JDAM to be fitted on smaller general
purpose bombs carried by fighters. For now, though, JDAM has
allowed the nation's expensive and little-used Cold War bombers
like the B-2 to finally play a vital role in conventional warfare.
</P>
<P>
   The billion-dollar B-2 was designed to carry nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   JDAM (pronounced jay-dam) has undergone extensive testing over
the last couple years, and has been certified to be used on the
B-52, B-1 and B-2 bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing inherited JDAM when it acquired McDonnell Douglas in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The kits are assembled in a building near the St. Louis airport,
not far from where the Boeing F-18 and F-15 fighters are built for
the Navy and Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the B-52s that have been used in Operation Allied Force
over Yugoslavia have carried only cruise missiles. A cruise missile
also can hit a target with pinpoint accuracy, but they each cost
upwards of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   JDAM is far cheaper, and almost as accurate. Each kit cost about
$18,000. Boeing believes it might even get the cost down to about
$15,000. That is several times less than the cost of a typical
laser-guided bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Laser-guided bombs were used extensively for the first time
during the Gulf War and are being used again on NATO bombing raids
over Yugoslavia. But laser-guided bombs are affected by clouds and
can only be used when the pilots can see their targets. JDAM works
in any kind of weather because it is guided to a target by the
Global Positioning Satellite System.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force is buying 62,000 JDAM kits from Boeing, and the
Navy 25,000 more. The total value of the Defense Department
contract is more than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has described the B-2 missions over Yugoslavia as
``very successful.'' That could translate into more JDAM orders for
Boeing if JDAM performed as advertised.
</P>
<P>
   The JDAM project grew out of the lessons learned in the Gulf
War. The military wanted a cheap weapon that could be used to
attack targets in all kinds of weather and with great accuracy, and
one that could be used by a bomber force that was built for nuclear
strikes, not a conventional war.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Pentagon figured each JDAM kit would cost about
$40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing was able to get the costs down by using commercial parts
and practices. The Pentagon also backed off from some performance
requirements that would have made the weapon more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The JDAM kit straps on the rear of existing 1,000 and 2,000
pounds bombs. Tail fins steer the bomb to the target. An electronic
navigation system in each unit is programmed while the plane is in
flight with the ground coordinates of the intended target.
</P>
<P>
   The B-2 can carry 16 2,000 pound JDAMS in its internal rotary
launcher.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb is dropped up to 15 miles from its target and signals
from the global positioning satellite system help keep it on track.
</P>
<P>
   The network of 24 satellites, orbiting about 11,000 miles in
space, is under the control of the Air Force. The system can
measure to within a few feet, though the military deliberately adds
inaccuracy to the satellite signals for civilian use.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon required JDAM to be accurate to within 13 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has said it got the accuracy down to 10 meters. The
company is now developing JDAM kits for general purpose 500 pound
bombs, and is working on wing kits that extend the the range of the
weapon. Improvements also are being made to the guidance system.

SOME EXPERTS SAY LEGAL BASIS OF NATO ACTION IN YUGOSLAVIA IS
SHAKY

<TEXT>
<P>
   The NATO attack on Yugoslavia skirts the edge of international
law, legal experts say. But there are few meaningful sanctions that
could be imposed under international law and legal principles are
vague enough to provide justification for the bombing as a
humanitarian act.
</P>
<P>
   The central assertion of the Yugoslav government, Russian
officials and other critics of the attack is that NATO has
illegally intervened in a sovereign nation's internal dispute. That
argument rests on the U.N. charter, which prohibits the use of
force except in self-defense, when a nation is threatened with
aggression or when the Security Council authorizes a military
operation for humanitarian or other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Security Council has passed resolutions expressing
concern over the situation in Kosovo, and has rejected a Russian
resolution demanding an immediate end to the air attacks on
Yugoslavia, it has not specifically authorized force.
</P>
<P>
   But by calling the attack a ``moral imperative,'' President
Clinton appears to be staking a claim to what some legal experts
say is an emerging exception in international law to the U.N.
charter's general prohibition on the use of force. That exception,
some legal scholars say, would authorize an attack to save people
like the Kosovo Albanians from persistent assault.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO bombing ``flouts the traditional interpretation of the
charter,'' said Allan Gerson, a former counsel to the U.S. mission
to the United Nations and now a senior fellow at the Council on
Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is compatible,'' Gerson said, ``with the emerging
international humanitarian law that recognizes the rights of
individuals to be protected from genocidal practices, torture and
other gross human rights abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Goldsmith, a professor of international law at the
University of Chicago Law School, said that critics of the NATO
bombing ``have a pretty good legal argument.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just read the letter of international law, it does not
expressly provide an exception for a humanitarian intervention,''
he said. ``But many people think such an exception does exist as a
matter of custom and practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have stated several grounds for the
attack. In addition to the claim that the Serbs' treatment of the
Kosovo Albanians was a humanitarian emergency, officials have
argued that Serbia has failed to abide by international agreements
and that the conflict could spread in the Balkans, threatening
world peace.
</P>
<P>
   Gerson said that that argument was similar to the arguments the
United States made to justify its intervention in Grenada in 1983.
At that time, the United States, which was criticized by other
countries at the United Nations, said that ``unique
circumstances,'' including a danger to hemispheric stability and
human rights abuses, justified military action, even though the
United States was not in imminent danger of attack.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, as now, he added, the United States took the risk that
it would be rebuked for violating international law. But since the
United States' veto power means the Security Council could not
formally declare it in violation of law over American objections,
the debate about legality is largely theoretical.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a situation like this, it is very hard to see what the
punishment for the United States or NATO could be,'' said
Goldsmith, of the University of Chicago. ``At the end of the day,
the consequences will be political and military and not legal.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, both internationally and domestically, the political
debate about the propriety of the NATO action was already being
influenced by the debate about international law.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics scoffed at the administration argument that the
bombing was required because of a humanitarian emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything can be an emergency if the intervening country
declares it so,'' said Ted Galen Carpenter, a foreign policy
specialist at the Cato Institute in Washington, which calls itself
a libertarian think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a longstanding standard of international law,''
Carpenter said, ``that internal disputes in a country, however
disagreeable, do not justify external military intervention.''

 &HT;    Irwin concerned with seconds, not mph
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Tex. _ Kenny Irwin climbed out of the No. 28 Ford
Taurus after his qualifying lap, teammate Dale Jarrett asked
``how'd that feel?'' and Irwin replied ``terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   So that's how driving really fast feels.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin whipped around Texas Motor Speedway's reconfigured 1-1/2
mile trial in a record 190.154 mph (28.398 seconds) to win the pole
for Sunday's Winston Cup Primestar 500. He'll start 10th in today's
Busch Coca-Cola 300.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never would have guessed we were that fast,'' said Irwin,
whose only other pole came last November in Atlanta. ``When you're
out there, you feel the car's loose, that it's pushing and it's not
all that fast. I honestly didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   And he'd rather not know, it turns out.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a driver, all of us, we don't know miles per hour, we know
seconds,'' Irwin said. ``Whether it's 28 seconds or 29.3 or
whatever. But mph is what all the fans want to know. That's fast,
yeah. But I'd rather not know miles per hour. Then you'd go slower.
Kind of like knowing more.''
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of impressive times on the stopwatches: 39
cars beat the previous track qualifying record, 185.906, set by
Jeremy Mayfield last April. Irwin said changes made to the track
after water seepage problems last year have made it faster.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte qualified second in the No. 18 Pontiac at 189.853
mph, a week after breaking his right shoulder in a Busch practice
at Darlington. He's got Busch driver Matt Kenseth standing by again
to relieve him if need be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask my wife, I'm not very tough,'' Labonte said. ``Trust me. I
can lean back on the seat the way we've got it all taped up. I
don't want to take any licks at all. The way it's positioned, it's
not as bad as I thought it would be. I can reach up and grab the
wheel. I can shift gears.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Park, qualifying third, had the best showing of the
Chevrolets, running his lap in 189.341 mph. It's his career-best
qualifying effort. His best start this season had been 23rd at
Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   Park said it takes a great deal of confidence to drive a car
near 190 around a speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just need a lot of guts,'' Park said. ``And a lot of
confidence in your car. It's one of the situations where the
confidence factor comes in again. You hear the crew chiefs say it
all the time. They'll stick their head in the window the last
minute and say 'I promise you this things's gonna stick.' And
you're like, all right, hop in the passenger side and if it doesn't
we'll all suffer the consequences. It all goes back to your
confidence in the car and your abilities. The only way you get that
is by going out and running good and proving to yourself that the
car will stick when it's down in the corner going 190 miles an
hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Labonte and Ward Burton qualified fourth and fifth,
respectively, followed by defending champion Mark Martin (188.957),
who had broken the track record in morning practice with a lap of
190.127 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Other notable qualifiers included Jeff Gordon (eighth), Bill
Elliott (ninth) and Mike Skinner (23rd). Darrell Waltrip, out of
provisionals, was 46th fastest (184.666), beating only Buckshot
Jones (183.955). Dale Earnhardt also failed to qualify.

 &HT;    Lietzke eases way into contention
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ Bruce Lietzke is every man's hero on
the PGA Tour. While others grind, the 47-year-old Texan just rolls
along. He hasn't had a lesson in 26 years. He built a sure-fire
fade in the '70s, and he isn't messing with it.
</P>
<P>
   While others are playing 25 events a year or hopping around the
world for appearance fees, Lietzke enjoys being a dad in North
Dallas and coaching his son's high school golf team. Later this
summer, he's going to put a 1927 Ford in hot rod condition.
</P>
<P>
   When he hits 50, Lietzke is certain to play on the Senior Tour,
but he isn't likely to be fanatical about it.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, what's the rush? The package still performs. He's two
shots off the lead in the richest full-field tournament in golf and
could be just two lazy days from beating all those range-ball crazy
kids on the PGA Tour for Sunday's $900,000 check.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's something to be said about guys that work too
much,'' Lietzke said. ``I'm a big believer that you can hurt
yourself on the practice range as much as you can help yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Lietzke, who made five birdies and a bogey while hitting 14
greens Friday, just hopes the greens still will be there when he
gets up this morning. Cut at 1/10th of an inch this week and baking
every day, they're taking on the color of a Texas tortilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greens look real sickly to me,'' he said. ``I have kind of
a problem with ... trying to ride the borderline of fairness and
unfairness when you put the health of the greens in peril for
people who want to play the golf course the rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly exits again
</P>
<P>
   The Players Championship and John Daly continue to be an unlucky
combination. In 1997, after an opening 76, he hit Jacksonville
Beach for a drinking binge, withdrew the next day and headed for
the Betty Ford Clinic. Friday before the second round, Daly, who
shot an 83 Thursday, withdrew because of what his representatives
said was a bad hip.
</P>
<P>
   Filling it up
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Bernhard Langer and Fulton Allem both holed out for
eagle 2s at the par-4 fourth hole Friday, prompting playing partner
Mike Hulbert to say later after his 4, ``There wasn't enough room
in the cup for my ball.'' ... England's Nick Faldo enjoyed only a
day away from his miseries. After a 71 Thursday, Faldo came back
with a 75. Nick Price, who shot one of three 67s Friday to stand
four shots back at 141, is having sinus problems because of the
pollen, which doesn't bode well for Augusta. ... Bob Friend managed
the tournament's second ace of the week, holing out at the 221-yard
eighth hole with a 4-iron. ... Atlanta's Billy Andrade made the cut
at 147 with a 74. ... After two days of play, 23 balls have gone in
the water at the 17th.

ROMAR SAYS SAINT LOUIS JOB `A COACH'S DREAM'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Fixes reported annual raise in second graph) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lorenzo Romar said last month he would leave his
job as Pepperdine's head men's basketball coach only if an offer
was ``very, very special.''
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity to coach in a bigger conference and get a
reported annual raise of $275,000 was a special situation. Romar
was introduced as the new head coach at Saint Louis University on
Friday, one day after interviewing for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``This, to me, is a coach's dream,'' Romar said in a press
conference. ``I said it would take something pretty special to make
me leave Malibu.''
</P>
<P>
   Romar, who coached the Waves for three seasons, was making
$125,000 at Pepperdine. His SLU deal, for a reported six years,
would call for an annual salary of $400,000, including shoe and
TV-radio deals.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine's 65-61 loss at Colorado on March 11 in the National
Invitation Tournament was the Waves' first postseason appearance in
five years. Even though Romar's overall record was sub-.500
(42-44), Pepperdine was 36-23 over the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a tremendous privilege for me to work at
Pepperdine the past three seasons,'' said Romar, who was en route
to Tampa, Fla., to attend the NCAA Final Four, in a statement.
``The Pepperdine program is moving forward and the future looks
bright. Pepperdine is a special place, and I will be forever
thankful for the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   John Watson, Pepperdine's athletic director, said he had mixed
feelings about losing Romar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt disappointed but I also felt good for him,'' Watson
said. ``Lorenzo is an amazing man. He was so much in harmony with
what we are trying to achieve here.''
</P>
<P>
   Romar's departure might have been surprising but the cupboard is
not bare. The new coach will inherit a team that lost two
significant seniors _ Jelani Gardner and Marc McDowell _ but
returns everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin Gibbs, a West Coast Conference Honorable Mention
selection, has two more years. Tommie Prince, the WCC's Defender of
the Year, is a former Proposition 16 player who is expected to gain
an extra year of eligibility through academic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Top recruit Kevin Bradley, a 6-foot-1 point guard from Compton
who is attending Irvine Valley College, is expected to start right
away as a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   Who will be the choice as the 10th head coach in the 61-year
history of the program? Watson said he received 11 faxed resumes
Friday from a coaching pool with ``a variety of qualifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine assistants Randy Bennett and Darwin Cook both asked
Watson to be considered for the job. UCLA assistants Michael Holton
and Jim Saia are also reportedly interested.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said the search should take about two to three weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration and a European security
group said on Friday that they had received reports from refugees
fleeing Kosovo and others that an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 ethnic
Albanian civilians were put on a forced march in central Kosovo by
Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   The administration cautioned that it did not have satellite
imagery to confirm the accounts. But the State Department warned
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia that it would use its
technological capabilities to monitor ``unfolding events in
Kosovo'' and would collect evidence of any war crimes, like summary
executions.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said that United States aerial
``assets'' were now being trained on the central Drenica region
where the civilians, believed to be refugees from attacks on
villages, were reportedly being pushed along a road with Serbian
tanks at their backs.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday night, the State Department had received more accounts
of a forced march from ethnic Albanian refugees who were
interviewed after reaching Macedonia, an official said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Organization for Security and Co-Operation
in Europe, the Vienna-based group whose monitors were evacuated to
Macedonia from Kosovo last week, said that the monitors had been
receiving telephone reports from local groups inside Kosovo. Those
reports estimated the numbers on a forced march at about 15,000.
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman suggested that the Serbs might be planning to
use the large group of ethnic Albanians as a human shield to
prevent NATO planes from attacking Serbian military installations.
</P>
<P>
   Other accounts of atrocities against ethnic Albanians continued
to surface on Friday. Human Rights Watch, a New York-based group,
said the bodies of a prominent human rights lawyer and his two sons
were found at a gas station near Pristina, possible evidence that
the Serb forces had stepped up their actions during the day while
NATO planes tried to punish the Serb military at night.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpectedly low number of refugees leaving Kosovo was
another possible indicator that the population was being terrorized
by the Serbs, meaning most people were too scared to leave their
homes, let alone try to flee, the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are extremely concerned that people are being terrorized
and are not able to move,'' said Panos Moumtzis, a spokesman for
the U.N. refugee agency. ``We've heard of villages being burned,
houses being burned and people being in a siege situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. refugee agency reported that 20 ethnic Albanian males
had been executed in the village of Goden in southern Kosovo. Women
who escaped and trekked into Albania told refugee officials that
Yugoslav forces separated men from women and children and killed
the men in front of them, Judith Kumin, a spokeswoman in Geneva
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the third night of the NATO bombing, a Pristina man
spoke by phone to a friend of his here in Washington and told of an
atmosphere of terror. His friend would only describe the Pristina
resident as an artist to try to protect his identity. In a tape
recording of the conversation, made available to The New York Times
by the friend, the man said: ``It's a great fear among all the
people here.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on: `Armed civilians are robbing all stores, stealing
everything. Firing is going on in lots of parts of town. They're
killing people, just executing them. There are reports in
Djakovica, 50 or more were killed. In Mitrovica, some parts are
burning. The situation is not good. We don't have electricity,
water, cell phones for two days have been cut. We are sitting here
waiting for the worst. It's a big terror because the Serbs are
doing what they want. They are armed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration acknowledged the escalating violence
by the forces of Milosevic, but suggested little could be done
except to collect evidence for prosecutors at the international
court for war crimes at the Hague. ``The United States is extremely
alarmed by reports of an escalating pattern of Serbian attacks on
Kosovar Albanian civilians,'' State Department spokesman James
Rubin said.

 WASHINGTON: James Rubin said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Noting the length of time it took to get satellite images to
confirm the massacre of Bosnian Muslims at Srbrenica in Bosnia in
1995, State Department officials said it could be some time before
any evidence of a forced march became clearer. It was ``some
weeks'' before intelligence agencies had sifted through the photos
taken by U2 pilots on ``sanction busting'' missions and identified
the Srbrenica massacre site, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons that intelligence officials were not able to
confirm a forced march or other reports of violence was that
analysts are focusing their work now on bomb damage assessment and
other tactical military issues in support of the NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. spy satellites, unmanned spy planes and U-2s are being used
to focus primarily on military targets for the airstrikes,
officials said. There may be some imagery or other intelligence
that will show evidence of the violence, but it will take time to
process, review and analyze.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Balkan wars, opponents have accused one another
of atrocities, sometimes unfounded or unconfirmed, to gain an
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, however, State Department officials gave reports of a
forced march considerable credence, without hard evidence. They
told allies the reports seemed ``horribly right,'' a Western
diplomat said. After being briefed on the reports this morning, a
senior State Department official said: ``Very likely it's
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House reiterated on Friday that NATO had no plans to
send troops into Kosovo right now to end the violence or to use a
ground force to back up the air campaign against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   After the international monitors left last weekend and Western
journalists were forced out on Thursday, the province became an
isolated preserve with Milosevic's well-armed forces free to do
what they wanted without observation from outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO air campaign, intended to inhibit and degrade the
ability of the Serb forces to attack ethnic Albanians had not done
so in the first two nights, officials said. In some instances, the
night time air bombardments might have emboldened the Serbs while
they still had time, some military experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of readily accessible information, human rights
groups and individuals telephoning into Kosovo on Friday described
some of the violence: the burning and looting of stores and
restaurants owned by ethnic Albanians in Pristina and other towns.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Bajram Kelmendi, a human rights lawyer and his two
sons, Kastriot and Kushtrim, were found shot dead at a gas station
between Pristina and Kosovo Polje, southwest of the capital. The
lawyer and his sons were taken from their home early Thursday
morning by police, according to Human Rights Watch. Kelmendi had
defended many political prisoners in Kosover over the last decade
and had recently defended the Albanian-language newspaper Koha
Ditore, which was shut down by the police earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Isa Zymberi, who serves in London as an information official for
the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, said he learned of the looting and
burning of shops and restaurants in Pristina through a telephone
call to a friend in the capital on Friday morning. The friend, who
is a film director, said he had the impression that the Serb
authorities were planning to film the destruction and broadcast it
as evidence of wreckage caused by NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of other destruction included the burning of the
Pristina warehouse of the Mother Theresa Society, the largest local
humanitarian organization in Kosovo. The warehouse was filled with
food and medicine and the society had to suspend operations, Human
Rights Watch said.

 &HT;    Spartans steel resolve for Duke
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Tom Izzo believes in being honest with
his players. That's why the Michigan State coach has minced no
words with his team concerning tonight's game with No. 1 Duke at
the NCAA Final Four at Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they play their `A' game, then not many teams are going to
beat them, including us,'' said Izzo, whose Big Ten champions
(33-4) bring a 22-game winning streak into tonight's contest.
``It's our job to make sure they don't play their `A' game. It's a
great opportunity for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are one of the top teams of all time,'' Michigan
State point guard Mateen Cleaves said. ``But after all the hype and
hoopla, you still have to go out and play 40 minutes of
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly, said Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski. ``We certainly don't
feel we're invincible,'' said Krzyzewski, who plays five sophomores
and a freshman in his top eight players. ``With our level of
experience, we can lose to anybody. It's simple. If somebody
outplays you, they can beat you. We just have to make sure they
don't outplay us.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's first game is the ``feel good'' matchup of the Final
Four, with two teams that are happy just to be here.
</P>
<P>
   After seven Sweet 16 appearances and three regional championship
losses, Jim Calhoun finally has taken UConn (32-2) to its first
Final Four. The Huskies, who won the West Regional, play Ohio State
(27-8).
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Ohio State was 8-22 and finished last in the Big
Ten. This year, the Buckeyes rode the talented backcourt of Scoonie
Penn and Michael Redd all the way through the South Regional and
their first Final Four appearance since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we've said to our players now is, `Don't settle,''' coach
Jim O'Brien said. ``Yeah, it's great to be here. But is this what
we want, or do we want just a little bit more?

FEW CLEAR LESSONS FROM NATION'S FIRST SCHOOL-CHOICE PROGRAM

 By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Nine years into the nation's first school-voucher
program here, there is no question that the concept has taken hold.
More than 6,000 poor children, 6 percent of the city's students,
receive publicly financed vouchers of nearly $5,000 a year to
attend private or parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   But for cities that are hotly debating vouchers, like New York,
where Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew recently threatened to quit over
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's support for them, Milwaukee's experience
shows that time and familiarity neither cool passions nor _ so far
_ prove or disprove the value of vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never settles down,'' said Howard Fuller, Milwaukee's
former superintendent of schools and an advocate of letting parents
choose their children's schools. ``Vouchers represent a fundamental
change in the way public schools are governed and financed, and the
people who stand to lose power aren't ever going to say, `Oh,
fine.'''
</P>
<P>
   While school officials and politicians debate whether the
vouchers hurt the city's public schools, researchers who have
studied the voucher system here, the Milwaukee Parental Choice
Program, are just as divided, offering warring studies on the
effects of vouchers on student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is clear that vouchers have brought profound change to
Milwaukee, spurring the creation of private schools, giving
low-income parents new choices and bolstering Roman Catholic
schools in particular.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Joan Antida High School, a Catholic girls' school where
the ninth-grade theology class spent a recent afternoon analyzing
psalms, a quarter of the students pay their tuition with $4,894
vouchers from the state. (Giuliani has not specified the value of a
voucher in New York, but most estimates place the figure at $2,000
or less). Parents apply for vouchers through the school they want
their child to attend, and the school agrees to accept the voucher
as full payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of education I want for my children,'' said
Valerie Johnson, who has two daughters at St. Joan Antida and two
sons at another Catholic school. ``I'm not against public
education, but I'm against low-quality education, and I don't want
my kids in a place where they have to go in and be scanned for
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not Catholic, but I'm very glad to have them get the
religious instruction here, as enrichment.''
</P>
<P>
   Voucher opponents say the program is sapping much-needed money
from the 101,000-student public school system. This year the state
paid private and parochial schools about $28 million to take
children with vouchers. But while enrollment fell by about 1,000,
the district's spending per pupil increased 8 percent this year, to
$8,914, and the overall budget increased about 7 percent, to $921
million.
</P>
<P>
   Even the number of students who have left public schools because
of vouchers is arguable. Only 1,295 of the more than 6,000 children
receiving vouchers this year also did so last year. According to
state data, 1,367 were enrolled in public schools last year, 1,114
were not enrolled in any school, but by far the largest group _
2,274 _ were already enrolled in parochial schools, which were not
eligible for the state program until this year. Many of those
children had privately financed vouchers from a group called
Partners Advancing Values in Education, or PAVE, making it
difficult to determine how many would be in public schools if not
for vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent of schools in Milwaukee, Alan Brown, said it
was still too early to assess the long-term impact of vouchers on
public schools and their students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vouchers and choice are still experiments,'' he said.
``There's no good evidence that turning poor kids over to a private
school will get books in their hands, cure their poverty, make for
better parents or change their lives. And parents aren't abandoning
the public schools in the droves predicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Brown said, the public schools are doing a better job
of publicizing their successes. ``Our reading scores went up for
the first time in five years,'' he said, ``and we're starting a
reading guarantee for children entering kindergarten: that by the
end of second grade, if they're not reading on grade level, we will
pay for tutoring.''
</P>
<P>
   What the public schools are not going out of their way to
publicize is the voucher program. The district's 55-page pamphlet
on choosing a school never uses the word ``voucher'' and includes
only one paragraph in the glossary mentioning the Milwaukee
Parental Choice Program, giving an 800 number for information.
Despite years of headlines, court battles and impassioned debate in
education circles, many poor inner-city families who would be
eligible for vouchers do not know the program exists.
</P>
<P>
   At the Milwaukee Public School headquarters recently, Diannia
Merriett was trying to transfer her 5-year-old niece, Lakisha
Childs, out of LaFollette school, where she was unhappy. Although
the district allows a wide choice of schools, Ms. Merriett and
Lakisha's 82-year-old grandmother, Martha James, were finding
frustration at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   In answer to a reporter's question, they said they had not
considered the voucher program because they had never heard of it.
But they were extremely interested when it was explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like just what we want,'' Ms. James said. ``I love
Catholic schools, but I don't have the money. I think she'd get
more attention there.'' Wisconsin has authorized vouchers for as
many as 15,000 Milwaukee children, a potential loss to the public
schools of $75 million a year, but the expansion is likely to be
slow because local private schools do not have room for 9,000 more
students.
</P>
<P>
   But adjusting to the loss of students and money is not simple
for the city, Brown said: ``When you have 30 children in a class,
and one leaves on a voucher, you lose the money for that child but
you can't reduce the temperature in the room one-thirtieth, you
can't get rid of one-thirtieth of a custodian.''
</P>
<P>
   School district employees discuss the program with a certain
battle-weariness. ``We live with it, but it remains divisive,''
said Karen Salzbrenner, a spokeswoman for the district. ``All the
arguments for vouchers are at the expense of the Milwaukee public
schools. And whenever we do something well, even something we've
worked on for years, they say it's because of them.''

 MILWAUKEE: of them.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Milwaukee, as in many cities, schools have been shaped by a
desegregation order and continuing efforts to fight racial
isolation in a district that is largely black.
</P>
<P>
   Even before vouchers, school choice was an essential part of the
effort. Parents may choose neighborhood schools or citywide magnet
schools, and about three-fourths get their first choice. Black,
Hispanic and Asian children in areas with few whites can attend
suburban public schools. And new schools are springing up, both
charter schools and schools designed to draw students using
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Marva Collins Preparatory School of Wisconsin, now in its
second year, is a private school that would not exist without the
vouchers that pay for 154 of its 180 students.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rauh, the principal, said there had been immediate
interest in the back-to-basics school for kindergarten through
fourth grade because the surrounding poor black neighborhood had
1,500 elementary school pupils and room for only 500 in the
neighborhood schools, leaving the rest to be bused out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year we had 320 applications for our 180 spots, and we
did a random drawing to choose,'' Rauh said. ``We believe everyone
can learn, and we're not trying to skim the best students. I don't
see us as sapping resources from the public schools, but as meeting
the neighborhood need.''
</P>
<P>
   Few students have used vouchers to leave Elm Creative Arts
School, a racially mixed magnet school where a lively gallery of
student art is crammed with soft-sculpture penguins, hanging
trapeze sculptures, three-dimensional stage models, painted wooden
snakes and cat-shaped pillows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only known one child to leave in my eight years here, but
if it threatens the Milwaukee public schools and the schools'
money, it threatens us,'' said Jean Kovac, an art teacher,
referring to the voucher program.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Tenorio, the assistant principal at Elm, said he felt
threatened. ``Parents often have the image that public means
problems, and private means better,'' Tenorio said. ``I worry about
losing the active, education-conscious parents that make such a
difference. Even if our budget isn't cut directly, it hurts us if
the system loses money for curriculum and testing and other things
they provide.''
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of high school principals recently, many said they
had particularly resented that the Milwaukee voucher program
charged the school system for thousands of students who had been in
parochial schools for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Milwaukee public schools lost millions of dollars for
students we were never serving, students who were already in
parochial schools,'' said Mary Ann Zapala, the principal of
Riverside High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like competition, if it's fair,'' Ms. Zapala said. ``What
seems so wrong about this is that the playing field is not level.
We have unionized teachers, licensing rules, required assessments.
They don't. We have to take everyone. They can take a kid, get the
money, and if there's any misbehavior, they can send him back to us
midyear.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Milwaukee schools accepting vouchers, 32 are secular and
56 are religious, mostly Catholic. Originally, the voucher program
did not include parochial schools. But in 1992 PAVE began to offer
thousands of low-income students vouchers for half of their tuition
at religious schools, and in 1995 state lawmakers expanded the
Milwaukee program to include religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   That was immediately challenged as unconstitutional, but in June
1998, the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld the expanded voucher
program.
</P>
<P>
   Although the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of the
Wisconsin ruling, the issue may ultimately be decided by the court
in one of the other school-choice cases making their way through
the system.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Milwaukee's Catholic schools are reaping the benefits.
Messmer High School, a Catholic school where almost half the
students receive vouchers _ and only about a third are Catholic _
is about to begin building that will allow it to increase
enrollment to about 500, from 355.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Robert Smith, the president of Messmer, sees his school
as an attractive alternative to North Division High School, a
nearby public school where, according to the city's school
accountability report, more students drop out than graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are happy stay where they are,'' Smith said. ``But
for people who aren't happy, we can offer something different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Religion hasn't been an issue for the families coming on the
choice program,'' Smith said. ``They know what they're coming here
for. No one has opted out of religious instruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, many of those on both sides agreed, excellent public
schools are the best defense against vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to get and keep the best kids is to create a
program that attracts them,'' said Susan Brown, a guidance
counselor at John Marshall High School, a city school that is
starting a prestigious ``international baccalaureate'' program to
entice strong students. ``And maybe vouchers contributed to our
doing that.''

   U.S. and allied forces tore deeper into the heart of the Serb
military machine Friday in a third day of air strikes across
Yugoslavia, as American warplanes shot down two Serb fighter jets
near a base of U.S. troops in neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, thousands of Serb troops backed with tanks
deepened their year-long campaign of terror, attacking villages and
ravaging homes amid unconfirmed reports of round-ups and summary
killings of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Across the region, anti-American violence swept as far away at
Greece, where an estimated 10,000 protesters marched on the U.S.
Embassy in Athens, hurling stones and bricks until they were
dispersed by riot police firing water cannons.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration found itself waging a
global campaign for public support for continuing the assault, even
as the Pentagon hunkered down for what could be a prolonged air war
on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin voiced outrage over the
escalating violence against ethnic Albanians, citing ''ominous''
reports of widening atrocities and warning that perpetrators would
be regarded as war criminals subject to trial and punishment once
the crisis ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are increasing reports of atrocities against Albanian
civilians in Kosovo,'' Rubin said. ``We are extremely alarmed by
these reports, and we are putting a great deal of resources and
effort into checking these out, as quickly as we can and as
thoroughly as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's Foreign Minister, Zivadin Jovanovic, went on the
CNN television network to decry the reports of atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethnic Albanians (in the Serbian province of Kosovo) are
Yugoslav citizens,'' Jovanovic insisted. ``They enjoy equal rights,
equal opportunities, but terrorists have to be neutralized.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade claims that its military campaign in Kosovo has been
necessary to combat rebel groups of Kosovar Albanians pressing for
independence for the province of 2.2 million people, 90 percent of
whom are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin cited reports that Serb forces executed 20 ethnic
Albanians in the village of Goden on Thursday. The alleged killings
were reported by refugees from the region to the United Nations
High Commission on Refugees, which is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. officials would not confirm the killings, the
International Crisis Group, a private private humanitarian
organization in Washington, has monitored the situation. The
group's Balkans program coordinator Albert Cevallos reported the
following alleged atrocities:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On Friday, Albanian lawyer Bayram Keljmendi, who was
representing the Koha Ditore, one of the largest Albanian
newspapers, and his two sons allegedly were taken from their home
in the Kosovo provincial capital of Pristina, and executed by
Serbian troops. The three mens' bodies were reportedly seen about
one mile outside of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On Thursday, the warehouse for the Mother Theresa Society, one
of the largest local humanitarian organizations, was burned to the
ground near Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On Friday, the press agency for the separatist rebels, the
Kosovo Liberation Army, reported that 20 Albanians had been killed
in a mass execution in the town of Orahovac, and another 10 in the
town of Podujevo.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On Thursday, the warehouse for the Mother Theresa Society, one
of the largest local humanitarian organizations, was burned to the
ground near Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the starkest testimony to the terror has been the number
of ethnic Albanians -- 365,000 as of Friday -- who have fled their
homes, most with only those belongings they could carry, to escape
the onslaught of Serb troops and thugs.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the horror, NATO officials in Brussels reported Friday
that 300 hardened Serb criminals have been released in recent days
and added to the ranks of the rampaging patrols in Kosovo, a
reprise of a tactic Serbs unleashed to brutal effect in their 3
1/2-year war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said it would step up its satellite surveillance of
Kosovo by flying unmanned drone aircraft into the region to monitor
by low altitude camera what can no longer be witnessed firsthand in
a province where international monitors, journalists and aid
workers have been forced to flee.
</P>
<P>
   To date, NATO attacks have focused on Serb air defenses, early
warning radar sites, fuel and ammunition dumps, power stations and
command and control systems.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks began around 9 p.m. local time Friday in Yugoslavia,
with news reports of explosions in at least 11 suburbs ringing the
capital of Belgrade, where air sirens blared and a city-wide
blackout was imposed for a third straight night.
</P>
<P>
   While hitting at the headquarters and supply centers of the Serb
army, police and special forces believed responsible for the bulk
of the Kosovo oppression, the U.S. Air Force has refrained from
using its extensive capabilities for pursuing tanks and troops in
the fields and on the roads of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That could change in the days ahead, however, Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon told reporters in Washington, as the NATO strikes
continued to weaken Serb air defenses, reducing the dangers to NATO
pilots flying missions directly targeting Serb forces in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``As these strikes continue over the following days, we will, as
appropriate, increase the concentration and focus on targets within
Kosovo itself,'' said Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials insisted, however, that the Serbs' ongoing
attacks on civilians are an extension of the very Serb repression
that has prompted the NATO strikes and should not be regarded as
retaliation for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be somehow quite perverse to put the cart before the
horse and somehow conclude that it's NATO action which has given
President Milosevic a pretext to crack down,'' NATO spokesman Jamie
Shea told reporters at alliance headquarters in Brussels. ``He's
been cracking down without any pretext at all for the best part of
a year. We are intervening to stop that from happening, and to stop
it once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic is the president of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it vowed to ratchet up air attacks directly on the Serb
forces conducting the repression in Kosovo, though, the Pentagon
got a bone-rattling reminder of the perils of continued conflict in
the Balkans.

   A pair of Yugoslav MiG-29 fighter jets managed to get within 25
miles of Tuzla, base for the 6,900 U.S. troops taking part in the
NATO peacekeeping operation in Bosnia, before being shot down by
two American F-15 fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb aircraft were spotted by a U.S. AWACS airplane flying
surveillance over the region, Bacon said. The AWACS alerted the
F-15 pilots, who were flying combat air patrols in the area and
quickly intercepted and destroyed the MiGs.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Friday, NATO patrols were searching for the Serb
pilots and the wreckage of the aircraft. Bacon said the MiGs'
mission remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts speculated, however, that Milosevic might have
hoped to slip past the NATO air defenses to stage a surprise attack
on the U.S. troops, stationed not far from where the MiGs were shot
down near the town of Teocak.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Mach 1, that's about 10 seconds from the Tuzla air base,''
said Balkans expert Bill Stuebner of the U.S. Institute for Peace,
a quasi-governmental think tank in Washington, D.C. ``Milosevic
must have decided to take a chance and send home body bags to the
United States to see how that would affect the dynamic here at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   His reference was to polls showing thin domestic support for
U.S.-led NATO strikes in Yugoslavia, a mission over which the
public is divided in a roughly even split.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to build public backing for his policy, President Clinton
planned to devote his Saturday radio address to the Kosovo crisis,
an issue he addressed the nation on when the air strikes began on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to reiterate his resolve to wage a long-term
air campaign against Serb military forces, unless Milosevic agrees
to an international peace plan for Kosovo.

STATUS OF WOMEN IN MILITARY IS SUBJECT OF PANEL DISCUSSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STACY DOWNS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEAVENWORTH, Kan. _ Attention surrounded Elizabeth Hoisington
after she and another woman became the first women generals of the
U.S. Army on June 11, 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Anna Mae Hayes, the native Kansan's picture appeared
on the front page of The New York Times and both were interviewed
by Barbara Walters. Hoisington's military career had begun in 1942,
and she eventually became director of the Women's Army Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought women in the Army were cooks or did cleaning,
but we surprised them,'' said Hoisington, who spoke in a panel
discussion about women in the military Thursday morning at Fort
Leavenworth as part of Women's History Month.
</P>
<P>
   Hoisington retired a year after her promotion, and since that
time, she's seen more of the barriers between men and women in the
military broken.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the sexes train together _ the Women's Army Corps was
dissolved in 1978. And more women have been promoted to higher
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Panel members, however, expressed frustration about the
struggles that remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're starting to fade away, but separate and secure
barracks? To some, that is one step backward,'' said Army Col.
Velma Richardson. ``And separate laundry rooms _ I guess some
people think there's something tawdry about sharing a laundry
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonya Martin, a colonel in the Army Reserves, recalled
participating in an operation in which the men and women were in
the same tent. Someone ordered, however, that there should be
same-sex tents instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That change made it so there were no communications,'' Martin
said. ``It made it difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoisington said women should be separated from men in the
military because of their ``physical and emotional differences.''
She thinks it will be a long time before people accept women in
combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be another generation before that happens,'' she
said. ``I don't think people are ready to see women come back in
body bags.''
</P>
<P>
   Most women on the panel said they have had to choose between a
military career and a family.
</P>
<P>
   Army Sgt. Maj. Cynthia Pritchett said she had been engaged and
her fiance, who also was in the military, wanted her to quit. Since
military assignments are demanding in time and location, it's
extremely difficult to raise children unless one parent remains at
home, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pritchett dropped the engagement and chose the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes down to it, you have to make the choice between
your personal life and the military,'' she said. ``If not, there
will be mediocrity somewhere down the road and something's got to
give.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said she is married, but chose to never have
children. None of the high-ranking female officers she knows has
children, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sacrifices and treatment of women in the military,
panel members said the nation is now more than ever willing to
elect a woman president.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people talk about Liddy Dole, they talk about her
connections and capabilities,'' Martin said. ``They talk less about
her gender.''

<P>
   U.S. and allied forces tore deeper into the heart of the Serb
military machine Friday in a third day of air strikes across
Yugoslavia, as American warplanes shot down two Serb fighter jets
near a base of U.S. troops in neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, thousands of Serb troops backed with tanks
deepened their year-long campaign of terror, attacking villages and
ravaging homes amid unconfirmed reports of round-ups and summary
killings of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Across the region, anti-American violence swept as far away at
Greece, where an estimated 10,000 protesters marched on the U.S.
Embassy in Athens, hurling stones and bricks until they were
dispersed by riot police firing water cannons.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration found itself waging a
global campaign for public support for continuing the assault, even
as the Pentagon hunkered down for what could be a prolonged air war
on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin voiced outrage over the
escalating violence against ethnic Albanians, citing ''ominous''
reports of widening atrocities and warning that perpetrators would
be regarded as war criminals subject to trial and punishment once
the crisis ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are increasing reports of atrocities against Albanian
civilians in Kosovo,'' Rubin said. ``We are extremely alarmed by
these reports, and we are putting a great deal of resources and
effort into checking these out, as quickly as we can and as
thoroughly as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's Foreign Minister, Zivadin Jovanovic, went on the
CNN television network to decry the reports of atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethnic Albanians (in the Serbian province of Kosovo) are
Yugoslav citizens,'' Jovanovic insisted. ``They enjoy equal rights,
equal opportunities, but terrorists have to be neutralized.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade claims that its military campaign in Kosovo has been
necessary to combat rebel groups of Kosovar Albanians pressing for
independence for the province of 2.2 million people, 90 percent of
whom are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin cited reports that Serb forces executed 20 ethnic
Albanians in the village of Goden on Thursday. The alleged killings
were reported by refugees from the region to the United Nations
High Commission on Refugees, which is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. officials would not confirm the killings, the
International Crisis Group, a private private humanitarian
organization in Washington, has monitored the situation. The
group's Balkans program coordinator Albert Cevallos reported the
following alleged atrocities:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On Friday, Albanian lawyer Bayram Keljmendi, who was
representing the Koha Ditore, one of the largest Albanian
newspapers, and his two sons allegedly were taken from their home
in the Kosovo provincial capital of Pristina, and executed by
Serbian troops. The three mens' bodies were reportedly seen about
one mile outside of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On Thursday, the warehouse for the Mother Theresa Society, one
of the largest local humanitarian organizations, was burned to the
ground near Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On Friday, the press agency for the separatist rebels, the
Kosovo Liberation Army, reported that 20 Albanians had been killed
in a mass execution in the town of Orahovac, and another 10 in the
town of Podujevo.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On Thursday, the warehouse for the Mother Theresa Society, one
of the largest local humanitarian organizations, was burned to the
ground near Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the starkest testimony to the terror has been the number
of ethnic Albanians -- 365,000 as of Friday -- who have fled their
homes, most with only those belongings they could carry, to escape
the onslaught of Serb troops and thugs.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the horror, NATO officials in Brussels reported Friday
that 300 hardened Serb criminals have been released in recent days
and added to the ranks of the rampaging patrols in Kosovo, a
reprise of a tactic Serbs unleashed to brutal effect in their 3
1/2-year war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said it would step up its satellite surveillance of
Kosovo by flying unmanned drone aircraft into the region to monitor
by low altitude camera what can no longer be witnessed firsthand in
a province where international monitors, journalists and aid
workers have been forced to flee.
</P>
<P>
   To date, NATO attacks have focused on Serb air defenses, early
warning radar sites, fuel and ammunition dumps, power stations and
command and control systems.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks began around 9 p.m. local time Friday in Yugoslavia,
with news reports of explosions in at least 11 suburbs ringing the
capital of Belgrade, where air sirens blared and a city-wide
blackout was imposed for a third straight night.
</P>
<P>
   While hitting at the headquarters and supply centers of the Serb
army, police and special forces believed responsible for the bulk
of the Kosovo oppression, the U.S. Air Force has refrained from
using its extensive capabilities for pursuing tanks and troops in
the fields and on the roads of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That could change in the days ahead, however, Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon told reporters in Washington, as the NATO strikes
continued to weaken Serb air defenses, reducing the dangers to NATO
pilots flying missions directly targeting Serb forces in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``As these strikes continue over the following days, we will, as
appropriate, increase the concentration and focus on targets within
Kosovo itself,'' said Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials insisted, however, that the Serbs' ongoing
attacks on civilians are an extension of the very Serb repression
that has prompted the NATO strikes and should not be regarded as
retaliation for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be somehow quite perverse to put the cart before the
horse and somehow conclude that it's NATO action which has given
President Milosevic a pretext to crack down,'' NATO spokesman Jamie
Shea told reporters at alliance headquarters in Brussels. ``He's
been cracking down without any pretext at all for the best part of
a year. We are intervening to stop that from happening, and to stop
it once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic is the president of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it vowed to ratchet up air attacks directly on the Serb
forces conducting the repression in Kosovo, though, the Pentagon
got a bone-rattling reminder of the perils of continued conflict in
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Yugoslav MiG-29 fighter jets managed to get within 25
miles of Tuzla, base for the 6,900 U.S. troops taking part in the
NATO peacekeeping operation in Bosnia, before being shot down by
two American F-15 fighters.
</P>

   The Serb aircraft were spotted by a U.S. AWACS airplane flying

   UNDATED: is not genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the roughly 2,000 ethnic Albanians killed by Serbs in
Kosovo don't approach the massacres of Bosnia or the machete
slaughter of fleeing refugees in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian concerns often are trumped by American
self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps if the country doing the killing is not an ally,''
said Doug Bandow, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Because the United States needs a military foothold by the
Mediterranean Sea, Bandow said, it does not come to the defense of
Kurds killed by Turkey's government.
</P>
<P>
   The people of East Timor have struggled against Indonesian rule
for generations, but America stayed out because there was a
strategic advantage in standing behind the Suharto regime. Russia
lodged a civil war in Chechnya and the United States remained idle
rather than tangle unnecessarily with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president says we're there for humanitarian reasons,''
said Michael Klare, a professor of peace and world security studies
at Hampshire College in Massachusetts. ``But this has not
characterized U.S. behavior in the past. We've got other things we
think about first sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback said Clinton put American forces in danger
without justifying the risk by establishing that Kosovo is special.
</P>
<P>
   ``If oppression is our standard, then there are far more places
that would require far less U.S. involvement,'' the Kansas
Republican said. ``In Sudan, just supplying food and materials to
the southern Sudanese would go a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   For him, the United States should enter another country's civil
war only after extended debate, both within NATO and in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   What to debate?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always a legitimate question...of whether the price
is worth the benefit,'' said Solarz, a former Democratic
congressman. ``But if we're not prepared to pay any price at all,
then we had better get out of the business of trying to provide
global leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggests weighing several factors. Is, for instance, there
true genocide? Can sending American planes or troops save more
lives than it risks? Does popular support exist at home?
</P>
<P>
   If U.S. involvement is prompted by strategic rather than
humanitarian worries, Solarz suggests again calculating the odds of
success, the mission's support at home and if the military action
will ``generate more problems than it solves.''
</P>
<P>
   In any estimation, he said leaders must understand that any
battle ``will inevitably exact a price in blood and treasure.''

MANY ASIAN ECONOMIES SHOULD STABILIZE THIS YEAR, TAIWAN'S ENVOY
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The economies of many Asian countries should
stabilize this year and begin rebounding next year, Stephen S.F.
Chen, Taiwan's ambassador to the United States, said Thursday in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a little bit optimistic,'' Chen said. ``I think economies
in Asia have bottomed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen spoke at an event sponsored by the International Relations
Council, the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce and the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Japan and Korea will come back. They are hard-working
peoples,'' Chen said earlier in the day during an interview at The
Kansas City Star.
</P>
<P>
   The economy of Taiwan, which Chen called ``free China,'' has
been resilient, growing at almost 5 percent last year. He
attributed that strength to low inflation, low unemployment, a
savings rate of more than 25 percent and a trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said Taiwan's $18 billion annual imports from the United
States had made it America's second-largest export market in Asia
and its seventh-largest trading partner globally.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan regained this relationship during more than 20 years of
effort after the United States broke relations with Taiwan in favor
of China in 1971, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Taiwan did not take issue with Washington's present
policy of constructive engagement with China. Economic reforms
there will eventually lead to democratic reforms, and that will
lead to reunification of the two Chinas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to the eventual unification with mainland
China, but under freedom and democracy,'' Chen said.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted it would be 30 years before China had a democracy
that approximated that of Taiwan. Until then, Taiwan must be able
to plot its own survival, Chen said. To do that, it needs to belong
to groups such as the World Trade Organization, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan is in final negotiations for entrance into the World
Trade Organization but has encountered resistance from European
countries wanting to consider the applications of both Chinas
simultaneously. China is not yet ``qualified'' to belong.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are not qualified, it is unfair for us to have to wait
indefinitely,'' Chen said.

 &HT;    Woman, 65, edges closer to college degree
 &HT;    By Don Horine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ It's been awhile since Evelyn Fein started
college _ about 65 years, in fact. But she's getting closer to
getting a degree, and she's doing it in style _ with straight A's.
</P>
<P>
   Fein, 83, has been taking one course a year at Palm Beach
Community College for six years _ ever since her husband, Martin,
died. This week the college honored her as one of two
nontraditional students of the year for the central campus.
</P>
<P>
   In appreciation, her son, Sandy, arranged for the college to get
a $10,000 donation from a private foundation he works for in Des
Moines, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Fein, who lives in Lake Worth, first took college courses in
1934 at City College of New York. She later took more classes at
Brooklyn College, where she was secretary to the dean of students.
She didn't earn college credit for some of the courses because they
were of a business rather than academic nature. But eventually she
realized what she really wanted was a liberal arts degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt I missed something in life by not having a
degree,'' she said. ``Besides, what can a woman my age do with
herself? She can play cards or read. Study is the next best
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   She lacks four courses for an associate of arts degree. She's
earned only A's in all six courses at PBCC. Her overall grade point
average isn't 4.0 _ but it's close, she said, about 3.8 or 3.9.
</P>
<P>
   PBCC speech instructor Kathleen Asher, from whom Fein took a
course last fall, said, ``She was a delight to have in class. She
took such an interest in the young people. She wanted to learn from
them, but the interesting thing is, the young people wanted to
learn from her, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Said her son: ``She's really focused on learning.''

<P>
   Q. I am 41 and would like to retire at age 50 with an income
stream of $50,000 a year. My IRA consists of $20,000 in Janus
Overseas and $20,000 in Vanguard Specialized Health Care funds. I
also have a taxable account of $64,000 invested in Vanguard Total
Stock Market Index. I contribute $2,000 a year to the IRAs and $200
a month to the taxable account. I also anticipate a pension of
$1,200 a month at age 50. If I work until age 55, it will be
$1,800. How am I doing?
</P>
<P>
   N.N., Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. I suspect you supplied the information about the pension
value at age 55 because you have an inkling that retirement at age
50 will be pretty tough. If so, you're right.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the numbers work out. If you continue savings at your
current rate and achieve average annual returns of 10 percent for
the next nine years, your pool will be 307,754. After collecting
your $1,200 monthly pension, you'd need $2,966 a month from your
investments to bring you to that $50,000 annual income stream. To
bring in such a sum without invading principal, you would require
investment returns of 11.57 percent _ out of the question for an
income-oriented retirement portfolio. Let's look at retirement at
age 55. With the boost in your pension, your monthly income
requirement would fall to $2,366. And with the extra five years of
contributions and portfolio growth, your retirement savings would
be $523,633 _ again presuming 10 percent average earnings. That sum
would fill your income needs if you averaged only 5.4 percent
portfolio returns. Put another way, you could invest about $440,000
of the retirement portfolio in fixed-income holdings to supply your
income stream, leaving the remainder in growth vehicles to build an
account to protect you against future inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Are these comfortable figures? No. I'd rather see you with a
total pool of about $640,000 at age 55 _ giving you a more
substantial amount of savings that should serve to protect against
future inflation. But to get there would require an additional $264
in monthly savings during the next 14 years. In the end, there are
only two ways to get to the target _ save more now, or wait longer
to retire. In considering all this, remember one truism _ the
earlier you retire, the more money you will need in reserve to
protect against inflation in your later retirement years.

   Q. I have held shares in Heartland Value since 1996, and at the
beginning of 1998 they were worth $14,850. At the end of the year
they were worth $13,148, representing a loss of $1,702. But I
received a form 1099 from Heartland for $47 in dividend income and
$255 in long-term capital gains for 1998. How can this happen when
I lost $1,702? Can I claim any capital loss?
</P>
<P>
   J.M., Boxford
</P>
<P>
   A. The truth of the matter is that most mutual funds are managed
with little or no regard to the tax implications of the portfolio
changes. The reason you got the form 1099 was that Heartland Value
distributed 6 cents per share in dividend income last year and 63
cents per share representing its net realized capital gains. These
are far from horrific levels. Can you remember back to 1997, which
was a more pleasant year for Heartland Value. That year the fund
distributed 17 cents per share in dividend income, and a whopping
$4.87 per share in capital gains distributions. But I'm sure you
didn't quibble about that much more substantial tax liability,
because in 1997 Heartland Value produced total returns of 23.19
percent. Yes, it is a completely different feeling to get a tax
bill for a year in which your fund lost 11.46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As for claiming a loss on the shares, that can be done only if
you sell them, and even then the question of whether you have a
gain or a loss depends not on what happened in 1998, but on how
much you paid for your shares back in 1996, and, if you have been
reinvesting distributions, through the subsequent purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar Mutual Funds argues that the fund's woes can be
traced to its asset base, which currently stands at $1.46 billion.
Such an amount would not be a big burden in most investment
spheres, but it's a lot of money to manage carefully if you're
focusing on micro-cap stocks. For that reason, Morningstar suggests
the fund is unlikely to return to the strong levels of its glory
years _ from 1991 through 1995, during which it grew from $29
million to $1.19 billion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 56. My portfolio includes a retirement plan at work in
which I have $43,350 in American Century Income and Growth, $11,800
in American Century Twentieth Century Ultra, $45,450 in Fidelity
Contrafund, and $11,300 in IDS New Dimensions. I add $530 a month,
and my employer contributes $220 monthly. In addition I have an IRA
through an insurance company, with $1,950 in a high-yield bond
account, $17,600 in managed account, $2,880 in an equity account,
and $2,110 in an international growth account. Finally, I have a
Roth IRA of $2,315 invested in Enterprise Growth. What do you think
I will have if I retire at 62 and/or 65?
</P>
<P>
   E.G., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A. Aside from your insurance company IRA, you have substantially
all of your money concentrated in one market sector _ large-cap
domestic stocks. Over the longer haul, I think you'll find that a
more diversified portfolio will serve you better.
</P>
<P>
   Also, you might consider reducing the risk level by moving the
investments toward more conservative holdings. It's time to begin
the process of winding down risk. You say that you don't have many
other choices with your employer's plan, but I'll bet what you mean
is the plan doesn't offer many choices that seem particularly
attractive based on their past performances. I would be much
happier if that retirement plan included a balanced fund, a
fixed-income element, a small-cap offering, and an international
fund. If you were able to put 10 percent of the plan assets in each
of these categories, you would go a long way both toward reducing
risk and building diversification.
</P>
<P>
   Where might you be in six or nine years? Let's begin with an
assumption of 8 percent average annual growth. With ongoing
contributions at current levels, the pool would grow to $288,614 in
six years and $393,913 in nine. Want to dream? Then plug a 10
percent growth assumption into the computer, and the six-year
accumulation comes out at $318,414, and the pool would be $455,042
after nine years.

<P>
   At 24 seconds after 12:16 p.m. last Thursday, 75,000 shares of
Lucent Technologies sold on the New York Stock Exchange for $101
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Who owned that information? The exchange, the brokers involved
or the buyer and seller? And whoever owns that factoid, how much
should the rest of us pay for it?
</P>
<P>
   With individual investors devouring more up-to-the-second market
data each day, the answers to those questions are becoming
important enough to have drawn the attention of Congress and market
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of money is at stake. The Big Board and the Nasdaq market
both take in millions of dollars by selling market data; the money
helps them compete against their increasingly numerous rivals, some
of whom could soon claim some of that revenue by registering as
exchanges with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Major on-line brokers, meanwhile, want big cuts in what they pay
for data. Such brokers pay the same flat fees for real-time
quotations as full-service brokerages do. But they want to cut the
extra fees they pay for quotes they provide to their on-line
clients via computer. Full-service brokers provide such quotes free
to clients by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Board and other exchanges sell their combined market
data to commercial information vendors like Reuters and Bloomberg
through the Consolidated Tape Association, a cooperative controlled
by the exchanges. The Nasdaq market sells its data separately to
vendors. In both cases, the vendors sell and distribute the
information to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, my dad called his broker at Paine Webber 19
times a day to check his stocks,'' said Kenneth Pasternak,
president of Knight/Trimark Group, the largest Nasdaq market maker.
``The exchanges did not charge Paine Webber 5 cents for every
telephone call for Pasternak.''
</P>
<P>
   Individual investors clearly want more market data at lower
cost. But the risk is that they could wind up with a marketplace in
which market data are more fragmented _ or one in which the loss of
data revenue impairs the maintenance of the technological and
regulatory infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has become so heated that the board of the National
Association of Securities Dealers last Thursday approved a one-year
pilot program that will cut the fees that individuals pay for
Nasdaq data.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is already in the act. In the House, Rep. Howard Coble,
R-N.C., has introduced a bill to provide anti-piracy protection to
commercial data base owners. The bill's fine print would affirm the
exchanges' ownership of their market data and allow them to sue in
federal court to prevent misuse or misappropriation of data.
</P>
<P>
   That bill is opposed by on-line brokers and several large Nasdaq
market makers, some of which question whether the exchanges own
their ticker information at all. They argue that the bill would
create an ``information monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John S. McCain, R-Ariz., has introduced a bill that would
amend federal law to assure that there is no limitation on the
public dissemination of stock ticker data. Such data are crucial to
American investors, McCain said. ``This kind of information is
facts, and facts should not be proprietary,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, chairman of the commerce committee, faces some
jurisdictional obstacles because bills affecting the stock market
are the province of the Senate Banking Committee's securities
subcommittee; he is seeking to act through his own panel. But the
chairman of the securities subcommittee, Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn.,
has also expressed concern about data fees.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the SEC and the Securities Industry Association, a
trade group, are both studying how much brokers and their customers
pay for real-time market data.
</P>
<P>
   Both the tape association and Nasdaq require commercial vendors
to apply different fee structures for market professionals, like
brokerage houses, and for nonprofessional investors. Until 1997,
professionals paid a flat monthly fee regardless of usage, and
nonprofessionals were charged either a flat monthly fee or a
half-cent for each stock quote, whether current or several hours
old.
</P>
<P>
   Late that year, the monthly professional fees were raised, the
nonprofessional fee for delayed quotes was eliminated and the
nonprofessional fee for each real-time quote was doubled, to a
penny. In Thursday's action, Nasdaq moved to roll back its increase
in per-quote fees, pending approval by the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   On-line investors have little interest in delayed quotes, and
demand for real-time quotes has exploded. Because most on-line
brokers absorb the cost of their customers' real-time quotes, the
fee increase has raised sharply the on-line brokers' costs.
</P>
<P>
   Industry lobbyists say they are determined to put a rollback of
Big Board and Amex ticker fees high on the regulatory agenda _ with
help from Congress, or without.

KANSAS CITY AREA WOULD BE IN BIG TROUBLE WITHOUT THE MAGIC COUNTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Do you know that the annual earnings of
workers in Johnson County, Kan., surged more than 125 percent, from
$4 billion to more than $9 billion, from 1986 to 1996? Do you care?
If not, you're overlooking the area's most mind-boggling economics
saga of the postwar era.
</P>
<P>
   It's usually a good idea to steer clear of lots of numbers when
writing for a general audience, but this effort is an exception to
the rule.
</P>
<P>
   The County Economic Research Institute puts out what it calls
``An Economic Primer'' of Johnson County that is chockablock with
numbers. It's an annual statistical snapshot designed to emphasize
Johnson County's prodigious presence in the metropolitan area and
the state of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   It fits easily into a jacket pocket, the better for business and
political leaders to carry and share with those who might be key to
furthering the county's incredible progress.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone interested in things economic knows Johnson County is
an 800-pound gorilla in Kansas and the area. A scan of this
brochure, however, reminds us that this King Kong may be even
larger than imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 update, for example, offers these tidbits:
</P>
<P>
   - From 1987 to 1997, Johnson County accounted for 55 percent of
the area's population growth and 61 percent of Kansas population
growth.
</P>
<P>
   - From 1986 to 1996, Johnson County accounted for 56 percent of
the area's net job growth and 38 percent of new Kansas jobs. At its
pace of job creation, it has been generating the companywide
employment of Hallmark every 23 months, Farmland Industries every
14 months, and Hoechst Marion Roussel every three months.
</P>
<P>
   - From 1986 to 1996, Johnson County added about 400 businesses a
year and accounted for 55 percent of the area's net gain in
business establishments and 57 percent in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   - In 1995, the latest year with available data, Johnson
Countians paid 25 percent of the state's total income tax revenue.
In fiscal 1997, county sales tax collections were 24 percent of the
Kansas total from this source. In 1997, assessed value of the
county's real and personal property amounted to more than 20
percent of the state's total.
</P>
<P>
   - From 1986 to 1996, the 21,500-plus retail jobs created in
Johnson County represented 56 percent of all such new jobs
generated in the area and 32 percent of the growth in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   - From 1986 to 1996, Johnson County accounted for one-third of
all job growth in the construction sector for the state and the
area. Construction wages in the county were nearly 30 percent
higher than the state average and 6 percent higher than the area
average.
</P>
<P>
   - Although manufacturing jobs are only 7.4 percent of Johnson
County's employment, compared with 13 percent statewide, the county
accounted for 13 percent of all the state's new manufacturing jobs
from 1986 to 1996. While the overall area lost more than 7,700
manufacturing jobs during that time, Johnson County added more than
3,000 in this sector.
</P>
<P>
   It's often been said, present company included, that this area
derives its identity and prestigious cachet from Kansas City. This
is true, no doubt, but as these telling statistics show, Johnson
County has become the primary engine of the area's growth.

FOREIGN POLICY IS COMPLICATED IN CHOOSING WHICH BATTLE TO FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON and RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Depending on who does the counting and how, anywhere
between a few dozen and 100 armed conflicts fester in various
countries on a given day.
</P>
<P>
   So why is America taking sides in Yugoslavia's civil war?
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton argues that the United States and its NATO
partners have a humanitarian obligation. To simply stand aside, he
contends, gives a green light to genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, critics note, the United States has mostly sat by during
the slaughter of ethnic groups in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Bosnia and
the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, Clinton says, this first-ever offensive strike by NATO
guards a strategic interest as well.
</P>
<P>
   Left unchecked, he maintains, the Yugoslav military could run
roughshod in the region. That, in turn, could tempt Albania and
Macedonia to take up arms. And that could beget trouble between
Greece and Turkey, NATO allies but historic rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the critics question the thinking. Russia has made clear
its anger about the air strikes. So American meddling in the
Balkans, they suggest, could do more to spread the conflict than
contain it. It wouldn't be the first time a world war started
there.
</P>
<P>
   Yet pressed for a set of rules or a rank of factors to decide
when to intrude in another country's civil war, the criticsback
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is,'' said Stephen Solarz of the Brussels-based
International Crisis Group, ``no magic formula.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead there emerges a tenuous agreement that foreign policy,
especially today's post-Cold War foreign policy, is unavoidably
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton's critics concede Slobodan Milosevic has the blood
of thousands of Kosovar Albanians on his hands and that containing
Yugoslavia's hatred won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is over how to stem the crises and whether Kosovo
outranks other trouble spots on the American agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars at the University of Hamburg in 1998 identified 31
full-scale ``wars'' and 18 ``armed conflicts'' around the world.
India alone was the theater of at least four wars in 1998; more
than a dozen wars raged in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States truly were basing these decisions on
human suffering, then it should have gotten involved long ago in
Algeria, Sudan, Zaire and Rwanda,'' said Michael Renner of the
Washington-based World Watch Institute. ``Suffering in Kosovo, so
far, is on a much, much lower scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the color of the victims does play a role in the
United States' action in these matters.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, U.S. intervention could be rationalized as
part of the larger cause to prevent the spread of communism. The
national interest of the United States, simply put, was whatever
foiled the national interest of its superpower rival, the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   With Kosovo, the Clinton administration bases its call to arms
on humanitarian concerns _ a dubious argument to those who note
that civilians have been slain by the tens of thousands elsewhere
in recent years without their killers feeling the sting of American
cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In Rwanda, government-orchestrated genocide in 1994 brought the
deaths of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically
moderate Hutus. Though the United States now backs the new
Tutsi-led government there, United Nations peacekeepers chose not
to intervene when the killings began.
</P>
<P>
   Elswhere in Africa, an estimated 80,000 people have been killed
in Algeria, 1.5 million have died since 1983 in the Sudan civil war
and perhaps 10,000 have died the last couple of weeks in the
Ethiopian-Eritrean war, according to the Transnational Foundation
for Peace and Future Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economics is often the basis of foreign policy, and there's
the perception that there's not much to be gained for the United
States in Africa,'' said Richard Knight, a researcher for the
Africa Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The ability of the military to matter is different, too, he
said. In Sierra Leone, the guerrilla fighting is waged street by
street, door to door. For American troops, it could prove full of
the sort of elusive targets that bedeviled troops in Somalia, where
18 U.S. troops were killed in an ambush and their corpses were
dragged through cheering crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Serbs, at least you've got a real army to go after,''
Knight said. ``At the same time, the message is sent that the
United States isn't going to put its prestige and resources on the
line in Africa, so things get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The 19 NATO allies trying to tame the Yugoslavs say that
outsiders should not enter every civil conflict, but that violence
in Kosovo demands a response because it is genocide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now (the Serbs have) started moving from village to village,
shelling civilians and torching their houses. We've seen innocent
people taken from their homes, forced to kneel in the dirt and
sprayed with bullets,'' Clinton said. ``This is not war in the
traditional sense....
</P>
<P>
   ``Ending this tragedy is a moral imperative.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton didn't specifically call Serb action in Kosovo
genocide, he compared it to the ethnic cleansing in the Bosnian war
that killed more than 200,000 and left 2 million homeless.
</P>
<P>
   White House polling, according to the Chicago Tribune, shows
that Americans would stand behind the president despite U.S.
casualties as long as the mission is designed to prevent ethnic
cleansing or genocide.
</P>
<P>
   But are the Serbs committing genocide against Albanian Kosovars?
Is it the systematic killing of an entire ethnic group, or are
civilians caught in a crossfire between the Serb government and the
Kosovo Liberation Army?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every victim wants to claim genocide today, and I don't say
that to demean the cause of the Kosovars,'' said Arch Puddington,
vice president of research for Freedom House, a human-rights group
that studies political and religious struggles around the globe.
``(But) a couple of thousand people killed in a bloody political
battle is not genocide.'' MORE

<TEXT>
<P>
   A New Web Site for Conference Calls &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Individual investors have been shut out of companies' conference
calls with analysts for just about as long as corporations have
been conducting such chats. Now, a new company is using its Web
site to keep individuals abreast of when such conference calls are
scheduled, providing dates, times and phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The new site, www.bestcalls.com, is the creation of Mark Coker,
33, who is president of Bestcalls.com and also runs a public
relations firm. The purpose of the site is to encourage investors
to contact companies that are holding conference calls and to
demand to be included. Often, Coker said, ``they can be invited if
they just ask to attend.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the site comes as Arthur Levitt, chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, has made the issue of selective
disclosure _ the release by corporations of financial information
exclusively to, say, Wall Street analysts or institutions _ a major
focus of the regulatory agency. Conference calls that exclude the
media and individual investors are a prime example of the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing couldn't have been any better,'' Coker said.
</P>
<P>
   Bestcalls.com uses two researchers to track down scheduled
conference calls; it also relies on corporate investor relations
officials and subscribers to post the information. Since it started
on March 20, about 7,000 subscribers have registered on the site,
which is free. Within two months, Bestcalls.com plans to start
posting advertisements on the site, Coker said.

   _ RICHARD TEITELBAUM &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Janus effect. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that an enormous chasm has developed between the
funds investing in large-capitalization growth companies and almost
every other type of fund. But even among large growth funds, Janus
20 continues to stand apart.
</P>
<P>
   After blowing away the rest of the nation's 25 largest funds
last year _ returning 73.4 percent _ it is looking like a repeat
winner for the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This year through March 25, the fund, which has about $20
billion in assets and usually holds 20 or so stocks, gained 18.6
percent, the best performance of the 25 biggest funds, according to
Lipper Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 stock holdings of the Janus 20, most with lofty
price-to-earnings ratios, made up almost 60 percent of its
portfolio as of Oct. 31. Shades of the Nifty 50? Shareholders
aren't complaining.
</P>
<P>
   A sibling, the Janus Fund, is running a distant No. 2 among the
25 biggest funds, with a 10.7 percent gain. The largest fund, the
$86 billion Fidelity Magellan, has returned 7 percent, good enough
for the No. 4 spot. And $78 billion Vanguard 500 Index fund and its
$23 billion institutional twin, aren't far behind, each with a
return of about 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By general equity categories, funds that mimic the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index have performed best in the quarter,
returning 5.1 percent, on average, followed by growth funds and
capital appreciation funds, at 3.7 percent and 3.0 percent,
respectively.

BILL TO LIMIT ABORTIONS WINS TENTATIVE APPROVAL IN KANSAS HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ A new attempt to restrict abortion in Kansas won
tentative approval Thursday from the Kansas House.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, girls 17 and younger who want an abortion would
first have to get written consent from a parent or approval from a
judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dare say that 99 percent of the Kansas families out there
want to know when their daughter's in trouble,'' said Rep. Susan
Wagle, a Wichita Republican and a leading anti-abortion lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Critics called the bill unnecessarily intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're messing where we don't belong,'' said Rep. Sue Storm, an
Overland Park Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Debates over abortion have become an annual event in the
Legislature, with anti-abortion forces wielding considerable
strength, particularly in the House. The vote in favor of the
latest bill was 67-35.
</P>
<P>
   Current law requires that before a girl 17 or younger receives
an abortion, a parent or legal guardian must be notified. The bill
approved Thursday would change that to require written consent.
</P>
<P>
   If a girl objected to the parental consent requirement _ or if
consent was denied _ she could petition a county district court for
a waiver of the requirement. An adult could help her with the
application. A judge could, depending on the circumstances, approve
an abortion. The legal proceedings would be confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the bill point out that teen-agers typically must get
parental approval for all sorts of activities, including school
field trips.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, including Missouri, already require parental
approval before underage girls receive an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   How the Senate would act on the consent bill isn't known. There
have been indications, however, that Gov. Bill Graves may veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Asked recently whether he supported a parental consent bill, the
governor replied: ``No, we don't think it's a very good bill. There
are concerns about whether it's even constitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill wasn't a top priority of the anti-abortion lobbying
organization Kansans for Life.
</P>
<P>
   David Gittrich, executive director of the group, said he hoped
the Legislature would first try to straighten out a confusing law
enacted a year ago to ban a procedure that anti-abortion groups
call ``partial-birth abortion.'' No bill on that subject has gone
through the House or Senate this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Kansans for Life applauds the parental consent bill,
Gittrich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's saddening over the years when we hear of parents who
don't want an abortion and find out someone has performed an
abortion on their girl,'' he said. ``There's nothing they can do
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the bill could lead to more minors having babies
against their will, or to delays in providing abortions, which
would increase costs and risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What protection does consent provide that notification does
not?'' asked Erika Fox, vice president for public policy for
Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ralph Tanner, a Baldwin Republican who previously has cast
anti-abortion votes, told the House he would vote present instead
of yes or no on the latest bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe we ought to be debating this proposition,''
Tanner said. ``Let us get away from this kind of business, let us
leave these kind of decisions to the family home.''

FORMER TEACHER PLEADS GUILTY TO HAVING SEX WITH 12-YEAR-OLD BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN HOFFMANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A former Kansas City area teacher pleaded
guilty Thursday to having sex with a 12-year-old pupil.
</P>
<P>
   Amy M. Rodriguez, 39, struggled with her emotions at times as
she answered lawyers' questions about what happened between her and
the boy last May and June. She had been a long-term substitute at
Raymore-Peculiar Middle School, where the boy attended.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she knew he was younger than 14. Yes, she had sexual
intercourse with him on three separate occasions at her Greenwood,
Mo., home. And yes, as her voice broke into a sob, she understood
it was illegal and could send her to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County Circuit Judge John Moran then accepted the guilty
plea from Rodriguez, found her guilty of three counts of
first-degree statutory rape, and scheduled a June 18 sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Geary Jaco, Rodriguez's attorney, said after the proceeding that
Rodriguez wanted to shield her two children and the victim from the
pain caused by a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a very difficult time for Mrs. Rodriguez,'' Jaco
said. ``She made the decision based on her concern for those three
children and any others who have been harmed by this.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rodriguez took the stand, she appeared mostly calm as she
answered scores of questions affirming her intent to waive a trial.
But her voice cracked when she talked of her involvement with the
boy and the range of punishment she faced.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the guilty plea, assistant Jackson County
prosecutor Ted Hunt recommended that Rodriguez spend no more than
15 years in prison. She could get probation. Without the agreement,
Rodriguez faced five years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Rodriguez and the boy began the
sexual relationship last May, including once when she told him to
tell his mother that he was sleeping over at a friend's house;
instead, he spent the night at the teacher's home. The records also
indicate that the boy's mother found romantic letters exchanged by
the boy and his teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez previously offered to surrender her Missouri teaching
certificate and will do so again after she is sentenced. Jaco said
Rodriguez is still living with her husband and children. He said
she has received psychological counseling since last summer.
</P>
<P>
   An official with the Missouri Department of Elementary and
Secondary Education said certain convictions, such as sexual
offenses involving children, require the automatic revocation of a
teaching license. The department has monitored the case against
Rodriguez and has waited for its resolution before taking official
action.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt said the agreement allowed the judge several options,
ranging from the full 15 years in prison to a mixture of prison and
sex-offender programs to probation.

   WASHINGTON _ The Yugoslav MiG-29s are among the world's top
fighter jets. But NATO has Awacs radar planes to track their every
move, long-range air-to-air missiles to shoot at them and better
trained pilots who anticipate the Yugoslav pilots' antiquated
Soviet-style tactics.
</P>
<P>
   And that, American and Yugoslav military experts said, is why
NATO has shot down 5 of Belgrade's 15 most advanced MiGs in three
days.
</P>
<P>
   NATO generals have been puzzling over why Yugoslavia sent up
three MiG-29s on the first day of the air campaign _ only to have
American and Dutch pilots shoot them down _ and have fired one of
its formidable surface-to-air missiles. It missed.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery deepened Friday, when two American F-15Cs shot down
two more MiG-29s that had crossed from Serbia into Bosnia. Four
other MiGs fled or were chased off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know why they were flying into Bosnia,'' said a
spokesman for the Pentagon, Kenneth Bacon, who suggested that the
planes might have been trying to attack allied forces in Bosnia or
lure the American jets into an ambush in Yugoslav airspace. ``If
this was the scheme, it backfired egregiously on the Yugoslavs.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and NATO have a sophisticated system of
tracking all aircraft in the air over Yugoslavia. Airborne Awacs
planes, playing traffic cop in the sky out of harm's way, can spot
an enemy plane as it takes off and, as the Awacs did Friday,
dispatch fighters to intercept it.
</P>
<P>
   With any element of surprise lost, the MiG pilots very quickly
found themselves in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their MiGs are at a disadvantage, because we're very good at
detecting anything that flies with our Awacs,'' said an American
Air Force general who insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition, they're very regimented in their tactics. It's
very Soviet style, in that everything they do is controlled from
the ground. They don't think for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The general said the U.S. planes had probably shot down the two
MiGs with long-range air-to-air Amraam missiles. Bacon said it was
unclear which of the four weapons aboard the F-15s had downed the
MiGs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another problem is that their pilots have very little flying
time,'' Lt. Col. Miljenko Radich, a retired Yugoslav Air Force
officer, said in a telephone interview from Zagreb. ``They are
trained for dogfights in the day, not at night. NATO selected the
time of attack marvelously.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilots who shot down the MiGs are extremely familiar with
the plane's strengths and weaknesses. Top-of-the-line former Soviet
aircraft have long been sought by American intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   So the Pentagon knows quite a bit about their electronics and
airframes, helping train Air Force pilots to knock them out of the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States has had
even closer looks at the planes _ simply by buying them. As part of
its efforts to stop the sale of sophisticated weaponry from the
former Soviet Union to unfriendly countries, the United States in
1997 bought 21 MiG-29s from the former Soviet Republic of Moldova.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In schools around the country, a complicated lesson in
geopolitics has suddenly sprung from the textbook onto the
television screen. And like many of their parents, students are
struggling to make sense of it.
</P>
<P>
   Few had heard of Kosovo before NATO began air strikes on
Wednesday. In interviews Friday, the military assault and its
historical background puzzled students at every grade level.
</P>
<P>
   But they, their parents and their teachers said the fighting in
the Balkans offered a chance to link current events and history.
And teachers were seizing the moment.
</P>
<P>
   At a Brooklyn high school named for Edward R. Murrow, famous for
his radio reporting of the bombing of London in World War II, only
a few hands went up Friday when James Patsaricas asked his
10th-grade social studies students if they knew what was happening
in Kosovo. One belonged to Dimitri Chudnovsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some kind of war going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other students seemed just as fuzzy on the details. But
Patsaricas, who teaches about World War II, pressed on. To
understand Stalin, he said, ``you need to understand someone named
Slobodan Milosevic,'' the president of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to relate old repression with new ``to understand
this man's mind-set,'' he said, ``because we are going to talk
about another dictator named Stalin who had a similar mind-set.''
</P>
<P>
   Before long, students were comparing the NATO rationale of
stopping the potential destruction of Kosovo's Albanians with
recent lessons about the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the bombing seems hard to understand because it runs
counter to schools' emphasis on resolving disputes through talk,
not fighting. ``The kids wanted to know why we aren't doing that
now with Yugoslavia,'' said Shirley Rinaldi, who teaches fifth- and
sixth-graders at Poughkeepsie, N.Y., Day School in the Hudson
Valley. ``That was very hard for me to answer. I don't think there
is a straight answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Janna Walters-Gidseg, 11, one of Ms. Rinaldi's fifth-graders, is
hoping for one. ``I'm kind of worried about how President Milosevic
won't talk,'' she said. ``NATO and the U.N. and our president all
want to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Older students, who recall the Persian Gulf war of 1991,
including bombing of Iraq, are more familiar with the ways of war
in the late 20th century _ the cycle of stalled talks and bombings,
and more talk and more military action.
</P>
<P>
   Tedd Levy, president of the National Council for the Social
Studies, a teachers organization, said the rash of ethnic conflicts
around the world since the end of the Cold War, and ample news
coverage of them, had made such events almost impossible to ignore
in the classroom. ``It has become an issue of great importance in
the social studies classroom,'' said Levy, a middle-school teacher
in Norwalk, Conn. ``I'm sure teachers are focusing more and more on
those issues of ethnic conflict, and this is the latest example.
It's sad to say, but violent issues engage kids more easily than
others. So this sad situation often makes it easier in the
classroom to motivate kids.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the case at Miramonte High School, near San Francisco,
where students said they had discussed Kosovo in government classes
after seeing television reports of the NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see another thing like what happened with
Hitler, with a terrible person taking over countries,'' said Laura
Leslie, a senior. ``We don't want to have to look back on some
historical tragedy that could have been prevented.''
</P>
<P>
   Saul Bruckner, the principal at Edward R. Murrow High in
Brooklyn, still teaches social studies there. He said that in
advance of his scheduled lessons next week on NATO and postwar
alliances, he had been questioning his students about Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Several said they had followed developments in newspapers and on
television but, as with other recent conflicts, they were difficult
to absorb because Kosovo seemed so distant. ``It's kind of
surreal,'' said Michael Feldman, a junior, ``because you hear about
war on TV shows and movies. But when you see it on the TV news, you
realize you are part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mollie Isaacson, a junior, said it took a trip to Israel, where
she saw soldiers carrying rifles as they strolled on the streets,
for the concept of war to hit home. ``I'd never seen someone with a
gun up close,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With some prodding, students in Patsaricas' class achieved his
goal: They engaged in a lively exchange over whether the United
States was improperly interfering in a sovereign nation's affairs
or justifiably seeking to end a conflict that could escalate into a
broader war.
</P>

 &HT;    Through the mail, reclusive Atlantan befriended and inspired
great writers

   ATLATNTA _ Hazel Elizabeth Hester took the bus to downtown
Atlanta every morning, where she worked as a clerk at a credit
bureau. She never married and never had children. She lived in
various apartments, amid towering stacks of books and a changing
menagerie of cats. For 76 years, she was seemingly invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Many were therefore surprised to discover, when she took her own
life this past Christmas season, that she made a bigger impact than
they knew. Betty Hester was, in fact, a prolific writer, a
self-taught philosopher and a vigorous, contentious critic of
modern literature.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was her criticism exercised in a vacuum. She exchanged
hundreds of letters with Flannery O'Connor and Iris Murdoch, two of
the greatest minds in modern fiction, both of whom seemed to crave
her commentary and friendship.
</P>
<P>
   This correspondence eventually provided a priceless window into
O'Connor's work. It was in O'Connor's 250 responses to Hester, whom
she called ``my adopted kin,'' that O'Connor gave perhaps the
clearest accounting of herself as an artist, a scholar and a Roman
Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Connor scholar Sally Fitzgerald published O'Connor's
collected letters in 1979 as the book ``The Habit of Being,'' the
letters to Hester were by far the most numerous and the most
interesting. Through those letters, O'Connor ultimately explained
herself to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   And the world needed an explanation. O'Connor was widely
misunderstood as a Southern grotesque, a misanthrope or a modernist
skewering the meaninglessness of life. Hester saw through
O'Connor's brutal tales to the possibility of grace that shines
within those narratives.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are stories about God, aren't they?'' Hester asked in
her first letter, in July 1955.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to know who this is who understands my stories,''
the writer responded.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began a relationship between two intellectually thirsty
women, sending thoughts between Milledgeville and Atlanta at a rate
sometimes of a letter a week. They would correspond for nine years,
until O'Connor's death in 1964. ``The distance is 87 miles,'' wrote
O'Connor, ``but I feel the spiritual distance is shorter.''
</P>
<P>
   Hester kept quiet about the correspondence, even after
O'Connor's death. She was reluctant to turn over her letters to
Fitzgerald and agreed to allow their publication only if her
identity was kept secret. Hence she is identified in ``The Habit of
Being'' only as ``A'' _ for ``Anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't want to be pursued by scholars and reporters,''
says Fitzgerald from her home in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarettes and philosophy
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor and Hester had much in common. Both were slightly
reclusive, bespectacled, diminutive women who lived with relatives,
never married and were amused by _ or indifferent to _ the
conventions of Southern society. Both lived and breathed ideas, and
in their letters they discussed Anton Chekhov, Henry James, Sigmund
Freud, Carl Jung, Simone Weil, Aristotle, Andre Gide, Elizabeth
Sewell, Truman Capote and Eudora Welty.
</P>
<P>
   Both made an art of self-deprecation, and O'Connor was
pleasantly surprised when they met for the first time in the summer
of 1956, after she invited Hester down to Milledgeville for a
weekend. The Atlantan was not as outlandish as she had described
herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was prepared for white hair, horn-rimmed spectacles, nose of
eagle and shape of ginger-beer bottle,'' wrote O'Connor after that
visit; ``you ain't even passably ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the young woman from Rome, who attended Young Harris
Academy in the late 1930s, was subtly attractive, with a mass of
dark curls and a Giaconda smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she was the pussycat's whiskers,'' says Anne Dunlap,
a roommate of Hester's at Young Harris, a small, rural campus where
Hester attended four years of high school and two years of junior
college. ``I have a vivid picture of her sitting cross-legged in
the middle of her bed, smoking one cigarette right after another,
expounding deep, dark philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap remembers being shocked by Hester's professed atheism,
her disdain of ``men and men's ideas'' and her distaste for
romance. At a school with compulsory chapel attendance, this was a
sophisticated stance.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Hester didn't dance or date or go out for fun. She wrote
for the school newspaper, smoked cigarettes and read voraciously
and endlessly. Her appetite was broad and deep, and ranged through
literature and philosophy into mathematics, physics and history.
``I felt illiterate in her presence,'' says friend Owen Moore, a
professor of French at West Georgia College.
</P>
<P>
   Hester would, through the influence of O'Connor, become a
Catholic from 1956 until 1961. During that time she wrote book
reviews for the diocesan publication The Bulletin, as did O'Connor.
They would be among the few of Hester's many writings to be
published.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing correspondence with British novelist Iris Murdoch
began to lead Hester in a different direction, says Fitzgerald.
``She wandered afield in pursuit of new intellectual life.''
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch, who died this year, wrote 26 novels and lectured in
philosophy at Oxford University. She was friend and colleague to
such giants of 20th-century philosophy as Jean-Paul Sartre and
Ludwig Wittgenstein.
</P>
<P>
   Sartre's existentialism and Wittgenstein's ``Tractatus
Logico-Philosophicus'' were meat and potatoes for Hester, who read
deeply in philosophy and, repudiating Christianity, created her own
idiosyncratic ideology. ``I intend to out-Aquinas Aquinas,'' she
wrote to friend William Sessions, in a letter about a 1966 essay of
hers titled ``Metaphysics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a remarkable woman who never gave up on her search for
the Absolute, with a capital A,'' says Sessions, a professor of
literature at Georgia State University and Hester's literary
executor.
</P>
<P>
   Hester and Murdoch enjoyed a correspondence that lasted for
three decades and rambled through discussions of topics high and
low, from Meister Eckhart to cats. Even after Murdoch developed
Alzheimer's disease and was unable to respond, her husband, John
Bayley, urged Hester to keep communicating: ``Please go on writing
to her because it means a lot to her,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Sleeping on the couch
</P>
<P>
   While the young woman's spiritual and intellectual life grew,
her material status was never flush. She worked for years at the
former Credit Bureau Inc. (now part of Equifax), doing typing and
filing. She owned neither a house nor a car, and took the bus to
work every day. For years she shared apartments with her aunt, Mrs.
Gladstone Pitt (whom everyone called ``Clyde''), first on Rumson
Road in Buckhead and then on 11th Street near Piedmont Park. Having
no room of her own, Hester slept on the living room couch,
surrounded by books and ashtrays. In the late 1970s Hester retired
early to help tend to her ailing aunt, and they moved to the
Cheshire Bridge Road-area ranch house where Hester would finish her
days. Her aunt died shortly after they moved.
</P>
<P>
   Without a connection to her friends at work, Hester's life was
more solitary than ever, and she began to reach beyond her
cloistered circumstances. At age 55, she decided to get a driver's
license and buy a car. She ran errands for neighbors and drove an
older friend to Mass every Sunday. (Hester stayed in the car and
worked crossword puzzles.)
</P>
<P>
   She looked after neighborhood children and seemed to have a
strong rapport with youngsters. ``She would encourage my
imagination, in a positive way, and not a lot of adults do that,''
says Oona Callaay, one of her former charges. Hester picked up
11-year-old Oona every day after school, read Beverly Cleary's
``The Mouse and the Motorcycle'' to her, typed her school papers on
an ancient manual typewriter and drove her to riding lessons. She
also helped Oona cope when her parents were going through a
divorce. ``She was in my life when I really needed somebody,'' says
Callaway, now 27 and living in Los Alamos, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   `This is the time'
</P>
<P>
   Hester showed some of her writings to neighborhood friends, such
as the novel ``The Sun My Slave'' and the short story ``Lover,''
but pooh-poohed suggestions that she try to publish them. ``I don't
know why she didn't try to get them published; they were
well-written,'' says neighbor Vi Patrick.
</P>
<P>
   She continued to trade letters with writers who intrigued her,
including Atlantan Greg Johnson, author of ``Pagan Babies,'' who
had published an essay about O'Connor that caught Hester's
attention. ``To be read by someone with Betty's intelligence and
rich literary background was certainly flattering,'' says Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   She was, as Johnson sensed, lonely, but prickly and determined
to be self-sufficient. ``Betty was a hard person to do things for,
she was so independent,'' says Oona's mother, Judy McConnell, who
invited Hester over for Thanksgiving dinner every year.
</P>
<P>
   When Hester fell down the steps in her front yard, McConnell's
husband, Bruce, insisted on building a banister for her. ``He did
that over Betty's loud protests,'' says Moore.
</P>
<P>
   She was surely under financial pressure, relying on Social
Security and a small inheritance from her aunt. But she refused
help and in fact was known to send a check to a family in need.
``Iris used to offer her money, but she was just too proud to take
it,'' says Bayley.
</P>
<P>
   Hester's health began to fail last year, and she saw a doctor
for the first time in a decade, Sessions says. Her physical
problems kept her at home and probably aggravated a lifelong
tendency toward depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things were beginning to fail in her body,'' says neighbor and
friend Feriel Feldman-Johnson. ``She very simply said, `This is the
time. It's not going to get better and I don't want it to get
worse.' ''
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas afternoon, the day before she shot herself with a
hollow-point bullet, Hester met with Sessions, and she seemed to be
in a good humor. She gave him all her manuscripts, which he says
should have been a tip-off that something was going to happen.
``I'm just a dull kind of practicing Catholic, and it never occurs
to me that people kill themselves,'' Sessions says, looking back. A
neighbor went by Hester's house the next day when she couldn't be
reached by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   A woman alone
</P>
<P>
   Betty Hester was fiercely independent all her life, and she
sacrificed a great deal to be able to live the way she wanted to,
trading a conventional social and family life for a world absorbed
in books and ideas. Perhaps, say her friends, the thing she feared
most was losing that hard-won freedom to think. Joanne House, who
is married to Hester's nearest relative, a nephew in Houston, says,
``I think Betty couldn't bear to think she couldn't take care of
herself and would have to be dependent on other people.''
</P>
<P>
   During the holiday week between Christmas and New Year's, Joanne
and Royce House came to Atlanta to help with funeral arrangements
and organize one last get-together at Betty's favorite Chinese
restaurant. ``I think it's amazing that on a rainy, cold Sunday,
with only a day and a half notice, 35 people showed up for that
brunch,'' says Joanne House.
</P>
<P>
   Though living alone, in a world apart, Betty Hester contributed
heartily to her own community. And with her invisible connections
to a larger community of writers, she made a lasting contribution
to the world of ideas, a contribution that will become better
understood as Sessions edits her letters and manuscripts and
completes a writing project about this singular, self-taught
eccentric.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne House believes that, although Hester eventually rejected
God as a product of humankind's wishful thinking, God would never
reject this lovable woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to think that God would get a kick out of her,'' she
says. ``I'm a Christian, and I truly believe there must be a spot
in God's heart for someone like Betty.''

AIRLINES CANCEL FLIGHTS NEAR AIRSTRIKE ZONE
</HEADLINE>
   (wg) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly before 3 p.m. on Wednesday, the same afternoon that NATO
warplanes and missiles attacked Yugoslavia, the Federal Aviation
Administration barred U.S. airlines from flying over the fighting
zone.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's single-sentence decree said that until further
notice ``operators of U.S. aircraft (unless such operator is a
foreign air carrier) are prohibited from operating into
Serbia-Montenegro air space due to recent military strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Few American commercial airlines, or the European carriers that
coordinate flights and schedules with them, fly over that area
under the best of conditions. But those that do had already changed
their flight plans in order to keep out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our daily nonstop from London to Delhi usually flies over a
small part of Yugoslavia,'' Joe Hopkins, a spokesman for United
Airlines, said Friday. ``But before hostilities broke out we
changed our routing to about 200 miles north of the bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines does not fly anywhere close to the combat zone,
but Austrian Airlines, which schedules flights in cooperation with
Delta, has extensive routes to Eastern Europe from its Vienna
headquarters, including routes to cities in Bosnia, Croatia and
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Under that partnership, Delta passengers bound for any of those
destinations would ordinarily fly to Vienna, then connect with
Austrian Airlines for the remainder of the journey.
</P>
<P>
   But when Delta decided on Wednesday that the bombing threats
were not bluffs, it stopped taking reservations or issuing tickets
for European destinations beyond Vienna. And Austrian Airlines
itself canceled its flights into or near the fighting zone.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, British Airways and Lufthansa, which have extensive
operations from the United States to Western Europe, and lesser
operations to Eastern Europe, also canceled flights they considered
risky.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, for example, British Airways suspended service
between Gatwick Airport in London and Belgrade, Yugoslavia; then it
canceled that service altogether until at least April 8. On Friday,
the airline resumed service to Zagreb, Croatia, and, for now, it
plans to continue its normal three-times-a-week service between
London and Ljubljana, Slovenia. Lufthansa also has suspended its
Belgrade service.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian Airlines canceled service not only to Belgrade but as
of Friday also to Timisoara, Romania; Tirana, Albania; and
Sarajevo, Mostar and Banja Luka in Bosnia. But the airline restored
service to Skopje, Macedonia, on Friday, and continued its
scheduled service to Sofia, Bulgaria, as well as Zagreb and
Ljubljana.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the government decree ordering U.S. planes to keep out of
the fighting zone, British Airways and Austrian Airlines said they
acted on their own _ but after extensive consultation. ``Those
decisions are made by our Operations Control in London, who
obviously are in close touch with the Foreign Office and others,''
said John Lampl, a British Airways spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Kennedy, the spokesman for Austrian Airways, said its
decisions on whether to cancel or suspend flights would be ``made
by our crisis management team in Vienna.''
</P>
<P>
   In an oddly prophetic statement in the current Sky Lines, the
Austrian Airlines in-flight magazine, Mario Rehulka and Dr. Herbert
Bammer, the airline's co-presidents, wrote, ``There have always
been regional trends that have dampened demand in trade and travel,
and these will persist.''

 &HT;    When is it going to end, Ohio State's Savoic asks
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Slobodan Savovic would not talk about the
NATO airstrikes, the 1,000-pound bombs screaming into Kosovo, the
upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   He is from Montenegro, a republic of Yugoslavia that shares a
border with Kosovo. His parents still live there in the small town
of Herceg-Novi. They are thus in danger. Make no mistake: Everyone
in that area is in danger.
</P>
<P>
   And yet here Savovic is, 19 years old, a freshman basketball
player at Ohio State, preparing for OSU's most important game in 31
years, a national semifinal against Connecticut tonight.
</P>
<P>
   War or basketball, which do you think dominates his thoughts?
</P>
<P>
   ``Does basketball have your full attention?'' he was asked
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no distractions?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe it for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   He is torn inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't talk about it,'' he said again and again. ``It's very
hard for me to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only once did he slip.
</P>
<P>
   Only once did he say, ``A lot of innocent people are going to
get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   His face showed no emotion as he said it, but you knew inside he
was bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   No matter where your politics fall, you realize that. You
realize no matter who holds the moral high ground, innocent people
will suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, however, Savovic did talk about the bombing
with a reporter for the Cleveland Plain-Dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am hurt,'' he said. ``Who wouldn't be? My country has been
at war for the last 10 years and I don't even know why. Who knows
why?''
</P>
<P>
   And then this: ``I don't want to say too much because I am from
Serbia. I just feel bad for both sides. There are kids everywhere,
and they don't know if they are going to die tomorrow, and it is
not their fault.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally: ``I don't get into politics. I don't care about
politics. I just want it to stop. I don't want anybody to get hurt.
I don't like anybody to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is all politics, and he knows it, and he hates it, and he
can do nothing about it.
</P>
<P>
   That's his main torment: Helplessness.
</P>
<P>
   The kid his teammates call ``Boban'' grew up in a Yugoslavia
where basketball pushed soccer for most popular sport.
</P>
<P>
   Savovic was a great basketball player, but when he turned 18,
his amateur eligibility ended. He either had to turn pro or give up
the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Not as pat as it sounds. Turning pro in Yugoslavia is like
forfeiting your future. Kids must sign a seven-year contract, ``and
although you sign for $30,000,'' Savovic said, ``they might give
you $5,000 and then they keep saying, `We give the rest later. We
give the rest later.' And you never get it.''
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to complete his education, so he drove to Belgrade,
far from home, and applied to the U.S. Embassy for a visa. He
wanted to move to America, live with his uncle in Newark, N.J., and
finish his final year of high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the embassy like 30 times,'' he said, ``and they
always find something why I can't go. `You don't have this or you
don't have this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then, without telling him why, they gave him the visa.
</P>
<P>
   When he climbed on the plane two summers ago, his idea of
America came strictly from the movies. ``I expected everything to
be great,'' he said, ``everybody to be rich, nobody to have
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   And what movies did he see?
</P>
<P>
   He thought for a while. ``Terminator,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' a writer said, ``that prepared you for Newark.''
</P>
<P>
   He is the cliched tall, dark and handsome _ with brown eyes and
black, curly hair cropped in Julius Caesar style.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has not been disappointed by America, even though he
came with such lofty expectations. ``From the first day I was
here,'' he said, ``everybody has treated me like part of the
family. The best thing about America is the freedom. Everybody's
got the same rights.''
</P>
<P>
   We take that for granted. Nobody else does. Sometimes it's good
to be reminded.
</P>
<P>
   Savovic's high school won the New Jersey 4A State championship,
and he narrowed his college choices to St. John's and Ohio State.
When St. John's fired Coach Fran Frischilla, Savovic was
Columbus-bound.
</P>
<P>
   He has been one the Buckeyes' innumerable role players. A
6-foot-6, 230-pound forward, he is averaging 5.3 points in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't seen his parents, Nikola and Olivera, since he left
home two years ago. He sends them tapes of the games. As did he,
they have been stonewalled trying to get visas from the American
embassy to come see their son play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a long trip to Belgrade,'' he said. ``And they've tried
a lot of times. But every time they go to the embassy, they won't
let them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the NCAA Tournament is big news in Yugoslavia. And Ohio
State's victory over St. John's was in big headlines. OSU's
semifinal game tonight will be shown live in Montenegro at 2:40
a.m. He said many people will be watching.
</P>
<P>
   If the camera is at the right angle, his countrymen back home
will see part of a tattoo sticking out from under Boban Savovic's
game jersey on the back of his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The tattoo addresses the violence and bloodshed in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The tattoo says it all.
</P>
<P>
   The tattoo says: When is it going to end?

THE ISSUES INVOLVED IN NATO'S OFFENSIVE AGAINST YUGOSLAVIA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN YEMMA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A brief look at the issues involved in the US-led air offensive
on Yugoslavia:
</P>
<P>
   How long will the raids last?
</P>
<P>
   At first, President Clinton and other officials said Operation
Allied Force would end when Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan
Milosevic, agreed to sign a peace agreement giving autonomy to
Kosovo Albanians. As the air campaign got under way, however, the
administration shifted to a goal of forcing the Yugoslav Army to
halt its offensive in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Is the air campaign changing Milosevic's mind?
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence yet. And so far there is no indication that
Yugoslav forces have stopped their campaign against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo. Quite the contrary: There were reports Friday
of Serb massacres of Albanian men in western Kosovo, of Albanian
leaders gunned down in Pristina, and of Yugoslav jets attacking
Kosovo Liberation Army positions. Milosevic even tried to widen the
war Friday, losing two MiGs in an attempted air attack on NATO
positions in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   What do the Serbs want?
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say Milosevic wants to push Albanians out of
northern Kosovo and establish it as a Serb enclave. This would fit
Milosevic's goal of creating a ``greater Serbia'' out of the
remnants of the Yugoslav federation, which broke up in 1991. All
that remains of the old Yugoslavia are the republics of Serbia and
Montenegro, both overwhelmingly populated by Serbs. Ethnic Serbs
also control the eastern third of Bosnia along the border with
Serbia. A Serb enclave in Kosovo would be similar to the one in
Bosnia and might contain the Serbian-Orthodox monastery at Pec,
holy sites at Devic, Decani, and Gracanica, and the battlefield of
Kosovo Polje, where Turks defeated Serbs in 1389.
</P>
<P>
   How much of Operation Allied Force is being shouldered by the US
military?
</P>
<P>
   NATO has 19 member nations, including the United States.
Thirteen of those members have contributed aircraft; eight have
been involved in bombing raids. With by far the best-equipped
military, the United States usually does the big work for NATO, and
NATO's commander, General Wesley Clark, is an American. Most of the
heavy weapons _ cruise missiles, long-range bombers, and tactical
fighter-bombers _ are American. US intelligence and reconnaisance
provide information on targets. US ships in the Adriatic stand
ready to dispatch helicopters to extract downed NATO pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Will US ground troops be called on?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said
Friday that there is no plan to send NATO ground forces into
Kosovo. However, if Milosevic agrees to halt operations in Kosovo,
many of the more than 10,000 NATO troops in Macedonia would be part
of a peacekeeping force to police a cease-fire. NATO is very wary
of fighting its way into Serb territory on the ground. In World War
II, Serb guerrillas tied up as many as 300,000 invading German
troops. Fighting on their own territory in the rugged hills that
make up much of Kosovo, Serbs almost certainly would inflict high
casualties on any invading force.
</P>
<P>
   What is NATO's military plan?
</P>
<P>
   Clark, the NATO commander, said the alliance will continue
pounding Yugoslav air defenses and military assets,
``systematically and progressively'' reducing Milosevic's ability
to make war. The next phase would be intense attacks on Yugoslav
troops in Kosovo _ a more dangerous mission for NATO pilots because
it would require close-in bombing that could make them vulnerable
to ground fire. Beyond that, secondary military targets throughout
Yugoslavia might be hit.
</P>
<P>
   Could this have been settled peacefully?
</P>
<P>
   There was a plan to do so. It would have given autonomy to the
Kosovo Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the province's
population. Milosevic rejected the plan, fearing that self-rule for
Albanians would quickly lead to an independent state. He and other
Serbs have argued that Kosovo is a province of Serbia and that no
outside power has a right to interfere in the internal affairs of a
sovereign nation. The United States and its European allies,
however, say the unfolding ethnic cleansing _ killing of ethnic
Albanians by Serbs _ in Kosovo created a moral imperative to act to
stop it.

 &HT;    `Other guys' may decide win between Ohio St.-UConn matchup
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun calls
forward Kevin Freeman the X-factor: a sometimes overlooked player
who can score and rebound and serve as that little needed extra in
a game.
</P>
<P>
   For Ohio State, power forward Jason Singleton and center Ken
Johnson could have that same tag. Not flashy or dominant, the two
can still decide a game with their play.
</P>
<P>
   With the guard matchups getting all of the attention as Ohio
State and Connecticut prepare to face off today in the Final Four,
coaches and players say the teams' role players could be the ones
to swing the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The matchups are going to be pretty even and could, in the
long run, cancel each other out,'' OSU coach Jim O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Calhoun: ``The game, quite frankly, might be decided by the
quote, `other guys.'''
</P>
<P>
   For the Huskies, the other guys include Ricky Moore, Jake
Voskuhl and Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, considered the team's best defender, is the third guard.
He's likely to draw Penn as his defensive assignment. The two
played against one another when Penn was at Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's the workhorse,'' Penn said of Moore. ``And if he
covers me or if he covers Mike (Redd), he's gonna have to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Freeman and Voskuhl are largely responsible for
Connecticut averaging seven more rebounds a game than its
opponents. Freeman is fighting a cold and an ear infection and
participated in a full practice for the first time this week on
Friday. Against Gonzaga in the regional final he felt fine and his
13 points, career-high 15 rebounds (10 offensive) and two free
throws with 6.2 seconds left were critical to the Huskies' win.
</P>
<P>
   Voskuhl, like Johnson, is a shot blocker who occasionally
contributes some double-digit scoring efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do a good job with Voskuhl and Freeman,'' O'Brien.
``I think that that's going to be a key factor for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies, meanwhile, are going to have to watch out for
players such as Brian Brown, George Reese, Singleton and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The latter duo combined for 25 points in the Buckeyes 77-74
regional final victory against St. John's. Johnson had seven blocks
in the game as well.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, OSU's third guard, has improved the team's perimeter
defense and allowed Penn more freedom to score. His 3-point
shooting, including a 3-for-3 performance in the second round
against Detroit, also has helped make up for the absence of Neshaun
Coleman, who was ill early in the tournament. Reese had a
career-high 15 rebounds against the Titans and has been an
important frontcourt reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Both Calhoun and O'Brien said it's important that their centers
stay out of foul trouble. Johnson was able to do that against St.
John's and the Buckeyes reaped the rewards. The soft-spoken 6-11
center who is majoring in art at Ohio State, said increased
confidence has been the main reason for his improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I looked at guys as being better and always felt I
was gonna get beat up ... because I was too skinny or so forth,''
he said. ``This year, I've played against everybody and I haven't
been dominated yet.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes the same will hold true today against Voskuhl and the
Huskies.

 &HT;    Scoonie oozes leadership, engergy
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ With his wide, gap-toothed grin and
endless energy, it's hard to imagine James ``Scoonie'' Penn as
lethargic. But last year was a year without competitive basketball
for Penn, a transfer from Boston College, and he just wasn't
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got mopey,'' OSU coach Jim O'Brien said of the Buckeyes'
junior point guard. ``There was no reward for him from all his hard
work in practice every day. I think he got to the point where he
was almost like a forgotten guy. People across the country forgot
that Scoonie Penn even existed.''
</P>
<P>
   One year later, as the Buckeyes prepare to face Connecticut in
the Final Four today, Penn needs no introduction. His game has
become as memorable as his nickname. His role on this Buckeye team
as irreplaceable as the team's chemistry. To many Ohio State fans,
he is Superman in Nikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have felt all along that he is a premier player,'' said
O'Brien, Penn's coach at Boston College before the two came to Ohio
State last season. ``And he's a better player now than during his
two years at BC. He's stronger, he's a brighter player, he's more
mature.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also the difference in a Buckeye team that went from 8-22
last season to 27-8 this year, one of the most dramatic turnarounds
in Division I college basketball history. More than his keen court
sense and 3-point shooting, Penn's leadership has proven to be the
missing ingredient for a previously hapless OSU program.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the team was lacking last year,'' fellow guard
Michael Redd said.
</P>
<P>
   That and confidence, a quality Penn oozes. It was Penn who
predicted the Bucks would make it to the NCAA
</P>
<P>
   Tournament when everybody else was simply hoping for a winning
season and maybe an NIT berth. O'Brien was not thrilled with his
point guard's public prediction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach said to turn it down and not to talk like that so
much,'' Penn said.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Brien also knows when to let his point guard loose, to let
him follow his instincts. Against Auburn in the South Regional
semifinals last week, the top-seeded Tigers had cut OSU's lead to
two with 31 seconds remaining in the first half. O'Brien wanted his
team's final shot to come with just a few ticks left on the clock.
But with 18 seconds to go, Penn launched a 3-pointer. O'Brien
grimaced, then relaxed. Penn's shot swished the shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scoonie made a big shot but it was not a shot that I was
really happy that he took, quite frankly,'' O'Brien said. ``When I
talked to him about it, he said he just kind of felt it. And I
said, `OK, fine.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have to let good players go. I have confidence
in his decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien also has confidence in Penn's ability, even when his
game falters.
</P>
<P>
   After a red-hot seven-game streak in which Penn averaged 22
points, he injured himself in the Bucks final regular season game
Feb. 27. In the next four games in the Big Ten and NCAA Tournament,
he averaged 12.7 points. Observers wanted to know what was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Penn said leg cramps and stiffness in his bruised hip
and buttocks affected his quickness and jump shot. But even after
he recovered, his shot was still not dropping. The questions got
louder. Penn kept shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it affected my confidence at all,'' he said of
the slump. ``I wasn't too down on it because I went through a
seven-game stretch where I was hitting everything. I knew that
couldn't keep up forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Auburn, Penn finally regained his offensive rhythm. He
made four of his seven 3-point attempts and finished with a
game-high 26 points. Against St. John's in the regional finals, he
was 7-of-13 from the field and scored 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, with a trip to the Final Four secured, he raced
around the court, swinging his No. 12 jersey above his head and
yelling to the crowd. He found his mother, Allegra, and squeezed
her tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe this? The Final Four!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His mother smiled and told him she knew it all along.
</P>
<P>
   Allegra, who raised four children on her own, had supported her
son's move from Boston College to Ohio State two years ago, even
though other family and friends advised Penn against it. At first,
Penn was apprehensive about leaving his home for Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Ohio was gonna be cornfields and animals and things
like that,'' Penn said. ``But it surprised me the type of place
Columbus is.''
</P>
<P>
   It was OSU's foundering basketball program that really attracted
him, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what I saw most was the challenge,'' Penn said. ``This
is a program that needed help being turned around. And that was
kind of the situation that I walked into at BC. And it is something
that I accepted. I don't mind a challenge at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The year before Penn arrived at BC, the Eagles were 9-19. His
freshman year, they improved to 19-11 and then 22-9 his sophomore
season. They made the NCAA Tournament both years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scoonie gave us problems when he was at BC and he certainly
has given other teams problems while at Ohio State,'' Connecticut
coach Jim Calhoun said. ``He's one of the best pure athletic guards
in the country. And he leads the team both physically and
emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes will find out today if he can lead them to the
national title game.

<P>
   When two of the leading online car-buying services, Autoweb.com
and Autobytel.com, took their stocks public last week, investors
found themselves scrambling to map out the differences between two
companies with eerily similar business plans.
</P>
<P>
   Autobytel, which early last week raised the range of its
offering price $4, opened trading on Friday at $23 a share and
ended at $40.25. Autoweb, which began trading on Tuesday at $14,
almost tripled that day, though it finished last week at $32.75.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the new, high-octane world of virtual car shopping,
where competition has ramped up so quickly that consumers _ as well
as some of the services themselves _ may be feeling like spectators
at a particularly wild drag race.
</P>
<P>
   According to Forrester Research, a market research firm, only a
tiny number of households actually bought their cars online last
year, and just 17,000 are expected to do so next year. But
consumers are increasingly doing their shopping on the Internet,
then finishing up their paperwork at dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   Online referrals, like those offered by Autoweb.com and
Autobytel.com, produced 800,000 sales last year, according to
Forrester, and will account for 5.2 million by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   These companies are also supporting sales by offering insurance,
financing, accessories and news about recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid acceptance of these basic Web shopping services has
forced the pioneers, which also include Microsoft's Carpoint
(carpoint.msn.com), to develop new ways to sustain their initial
popularity. And it has drawn car manufacturers and dealers online,
too.
</P>
<P>
   For example, General Motors introduced a Web site early this
month (www.gmbuypower.com) that it calls the world's largest
virtual showroom. The site lets shoppers search for vehicles with
the equipment of their choice on almost 6,000 dealers' lots.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers cannot buy cars, but they can exchange e-mail with
dealerships, schedule test drives and apply for financing.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say GM's site is far more sophisticated than
those of most car makers. Still, investors may not be wrong to bet,
at least in the short term, on services like Autoweb.com and
Autobytel.com. Many shoppers turn to them even after they've
visited other online resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers still perceive the independent services to be more
reliable sources of information,'' said Chris Denove, director of
consulting operations at J.D. Power &AMP; Associates, the automotive
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jupiter Communications, an Internet research firm,
94 percent of all car purchase requests submitted over the Internet
last year came from car-buying services. Just 4 percent came from
manufacturers' Web sites; the other 2 percent came from dealers'
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Among independent services, Carpoint had the most visited Web
site last month, followed by Autoweb.com, Cars.com (a service
backed by eight big newspaper publishers, including The New York
Times Co.), and Autobytel.com, according to Media Metrix, which
tracks Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   To retain users, the independent services have been introducing
new ways to assist consumers. Carpoint, for example, introduced a
car maintenance service in November, which, among other things,
lets users track maintenance visits. Autobytel.com offers its users
a ``dream car''; they get an e-mail whenever a car meeting their
specifications becomes available from an affiliated dealer. And
Autoweb.com is setting up a service center that, among other
things, will provide advice on selected topics from an online
mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Another fairly recent development online is help for consumers
who are shopping for used cars.
</P>
<P>
   This is a trickier market for Internet commerce, according to
researchers like Forrester; each used car is unique, and Web users,
who tend to be affluent, are more interested in new vehicles.
Still, the fast growth of the nine-month-old Cars.com, which lets
users search its newspaper affiliates' used-car ads online, has
spurred the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Autobytel.com has a used-car cyberstore with photographs of the
vehicles and a three-day money-back guarantee on purchases
initiated through the site. The company says each vehicle passes a
135-point inspection.

   Last week, Carpoint began rolling out what it says is a first
for the Internet _ a feature that gives shoppers bird's-eye,
360-degree interior pictures of used cars.
</P>
<P>
   Though auctions have become popular online for everything from
plane tickets to Beanie Babies, they have not popped up on the Web
for cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting idea, but from a consumer's perspective,
it's not a great deal,'' said Alex Simons, a Carpoint product
manager. He said online auctions run counter to the haggle-free
approach that makes online services attractive to many users and
online car shoppers don't seem to like committing to a purchase.

<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia _ As loud explosions shook this city and
fiery flashes lit up the sky on the third straight night of bombing
here Friday, the Yugoslav Army was moving to evade intensifying
blows of NATO's punishing air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 1 a.m., a series of blasts appeared to come from
the direction of the adjacent civilian airport and the military air
base outside the city, which had been hit in previous nights.
</P>
<P>
   But as with the previous two nights of bombardment, the Yugoslav
Army appeared not to put up any visible defense, despite having as
many as 2,000 surface-to-air missiles. Analysts said President
Slobodan Milosevic appeared to be trying to endure the intensifying
attacks while preserving as much of his military capacity as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, in a pattern reportedly repeated throughout
Yugoslavia, troops and military hardware were relocating from their
bases both to remote areas and to civilian locales. Hundreds of
soldiers from a military base near this regional capital set up a
temporary encampment on the wooded hillside of a national park on
the outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   But even as NATO stepped up its campaign to batter Milosevic's
regime, this deeply divided state was convulsing as leaders of
parliament struggled to reach an uneasy truce and avert a civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   One consequence of the NATO attack has been a political upheaval
in Montenegro, the smaller of the two republics that make up what
is left of a crumbling Yugoslavia. Half the republic supports the
Serbian nationalist aspirations of Milosevic, but the other half
favors independence from Serbia, including the more liberal,
Western-leaning coalition that currently governs Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the chaos and fear brought on by the air strikes, there has
been widespread speculation that Milosevic would wrest control from
the Montenegrin government or that the government might seize the
moment to declare independence.
</P>
<P>
   Either scenario would probably throw the republic into open
warfare, leaders of both factions said. But late Friday, after
three long days of debate, both the pro-Milosevic parties and the
pro-Montenegrin parties voted for a resolution affirming they would
try to work together to preserve the fragile status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Even as NATO warplanes reappeared in the skies overhead Friday,
Montenegrins seemed more focused on the live coverage of the
parliamentary session. Cooks and waiters at a restaurant gathered
around a television. People stopped on the street and listened to
radios in stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what people care about. The NATO bombs will end soon,
but Montenegro is being pulled apart,'' said a taxi driver, Ganjo
Nejad, who sat glued to his car radio.
</P>
<P>
   One of Yugoslavia's national heroes, Jano Kapicic, 80, a
legendary World War II general and close political adviser to
former Communist President Josip Broz Tito, was one of many elder
statesmen in Montenegro trying to defuse the palpable tension
before it could explode into civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the 78-member Parliament's nearly unanimous vote for
conciliation, Kapicic was still worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think America understood the results within Yugoslavia
of their actions,'' he said. ``Today there are words from
politicians, but the problems are still here. It is a very
explosive situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a civil war here, the NATO bombings will seem like
nothing,'' he said. ``A war here would be blood everywhere. Blood.
Nothing else. Young and old. I hope it doesn't happen, it would be
a catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   Ranko Krivokapic, a liberal member of Parliament, said after the
session, ``Montenegro should be independent, but this is not the
time. Everything is under control for now. But only for now.''

 &HT;    Behind-the-scenes players enjoying the ride to Final Four
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Dayton is not without representation on
this overachieving Ohio State team.
</P>
<P>
   Junior forward Kwadjo Steele, who played three years at Dunbar
High School, and Mike Ullmer, a team manager from Centerville, are
two key behind-the-scenes members of the Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
   Steele is mainly a practice player who has played just 37
minutes all season. Ullmer is one of 10 team managers whose
responsibilities include everything from washing team uniforms to
fetching errant rebounds at practice to doling out players' per
diem on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Not flashy stuff but nonetheless important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making the Final Four was a goal that we all had and I helped
reached that goal even if I was in the background,'' said Steele,
who played his senior year of basketball at Westerville North High
School in Columbus. His mother, Carolyn, still lives in Dayton and
works as a counselor at Sinclair Community College.
</P>
<P>
   Ullmer, a former basketball manager at Alter, said he was never
good enough to play high school or college basketball but wanted to
be involved with the sport. ``I love basketball,'' he said. ``I
figured this was a great way to be part of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The two said so far the trip to the Final Four has been great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to three Final Fours at Alter and this is not even
close,'' Ullmer said. ``It's unbelievable. Everything is
first-class. It's the red-carpet treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele said being an unknown, little-used player has its ups and
downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing is I don't have to deal with some of the
pressures the other guys deal with,'' Steele, a zoology major at
OSU, said. ``The bad side is you don't get recognized. I still have
family that don't know I play on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Team hideaway
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the circus-like atmosphere that surrounds a major
event such as the Final Four, Ohio State officials and coaches
wanted quiet, out-of-the-way accommodations for their stay. A place
where fans and boosters and agents couldn't hound players _ or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the Bucks wound up at a secluded and well-guarded
condominium complex about 20 miles from Tropicana Field, the site
of the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Patrolled by private security guards and protected by a six-foot
high fence, the brand new complex is closed to reporters, fans and
anyone else not affiliated with the team.
</P>
<P>
   The players say the accommodations are plush: Each player has
his own bedroom and bathroom and shares a kitchen with his
condo-mate. There are washers-and-dryers on site and plenty of
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the team's digs, reserve Devon Smith said: ``If we
tell you, we have to kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Said reserve Shamar Herron: ``If my apartment could be that nice
at home, I would be living the life.''

ELDERLY FIND A CHAMPION AGAINST HMO DRUG CUTBACKS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ William Galvin, the low-profile Massachusetts secretary
of state, is normally more even-tempered. But he just got too
outraged, he says, by the hundreds of phone calls his office was
getting from elderly people suddenly struggling to afford their
prescription medicine.
</P>
<P>
   So Friday, Galvin, who as secretary of state has the power to
regulate corporations, held an informal hearing of staff members
and representatives of health maintenance organizations as part of
an unusual political salvo against HMOs: he called for public
comment on whether a handful of Massachusetts HMOs deserved to
retain their nonprofit status.
</P>
<P>
   And he said that he would pursue more formal legal proceedings
that could strip them of their nonprofit status, and perhaps the
tax exemptions that come with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to operate like a business, and tell people
such as these that `For financial reasons, we're cutting you off,'
they should be treated like a business,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``Why should Massachusetts give them the benefit of
nontax status?''
</P>
<P>
   What touched off Galvin's offensive was a change in law that
essentially brought Massachusetts HMOs in line with those in the
rest of the country. A 1994 state law, unique to Massachusetts, had
required the state's HMOs, which are widely considered some of the
best in the country, to offer their elderly members the option of a
plan that would fully cover their prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But because a 1997 Federal law prohibited states from requiring
the HMOs to offer full drug coverage, the HMOs stopped offering it
as of Jan. 1 and changed their pharmacy plans significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Galvin said, calls of distress have mounted from
elderly people, including couples in which one spouse has been
forgoing drugs for chronic conditions to help pay for treating the
other spouse's more acute illness.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Friday's hearing, the president of the
Massachusetts Association of Health Maintenance Organizations,
Robert Hughes, questioned whether Galvin had the authority to
revoke their nonprofit status. Hughes said legal steps by other
bodies would be required, and he questioned the wisdom of Galvin's
whole approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case of `no good deed goes unpunished,''' Hughes
said, arguing that under the recent changes in prescription
coverage, ``I think the vast majority of seniors are better off,
not worse off.''
</P>
<P>
   Of about 52,000 elderly Massachusetts people who had HMO
prescription drug benefits at the end of 1997, he said, perhaps 75
percent benefit by the new regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although this is not to minimize in any way the problems of
those who were made worse off,'' he added. ``There could be several
thousands who are in fact experiencing difficulty in paying for
their drugs if they have high drug needs.''
</P>
<P>
   But the HMO group prefers to seek a solution in the Legislature,
Hughes said, by helping to design a pharmacy assistance program to
help the worst-off elderly; and the state's congressional members
are working on the issue as well, he noted. He asserted Galvin was
``focusing on completely irrelevant issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But they do not seem irrelevant to Arthur Morrissette, a master
mechanic and lung transplant recipient, who has been backing up
Galvin from his hospital bed in Massachusetts General Hospital,
where he is fighting pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Morrissette said that he and his wife intentionally signed up
for an HMO because of its unlimited drug benefits, and that he was
counting on those benefits when he decided to go ahead last August
with a lung transplant to counter his emphysema.
</P>
<P>
   Then, late last year, after the transplant, he was informed that
from now on, only $800 a year of his medication would be covered.
The 10-odd drugs Morrissette takes can run up to $1,500 a month.
</P>
<P>
   He left the HMO, went back on Medicare and bought expensive
insurance to cover the gap between it and his drug needs, and
things are basically working out, he said; but thousands of others
have been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have companies like Harvard Pilgrim who say they're
nonprofit and are trying to get rid of high-risk patients because
they cost them too much, don't tell me they're nonprofit,''
Morrissette said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Galvin and his staff said they also planned to examine the
relationships between the nonprofit HMOs and other parent, sister
or subsidiary entities that are for-profit. ``If a nonprofit is
being used as a shield to funnel money to a private entity,
individual or corporate, I believe the law in Massachusetts does
not tolerate that entity remaining nonprofit,'' Galvin told the
hearing Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response Friday, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care
officials said they had not violated their corporation charter, and
continued to perform charitable functions. They argued that they
had been financially forced to move away from full drug coverage
because drugs were the fastest-growing component of health care
spending, and said that nonetheless, 86 percent of their Medicare
members were better off, or no worse off, under the new system.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox in Galvin's move on Massachusetts HMOs is that they
have been repeatedly ranked among the best in the country, and are
considered unusually successful both in keeping members healthy and
treating them when they fall ill.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those that Galvin named Friday, including Fallon
Community Health Plan, based in Worcester, Mass., Tufts Health Plan
and Harvard Pilgrim Health Plan, were at the top of the U.S. News
and World Report's list of the best managed-care plans late last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But Galvin said the willingness of the HMOs to end the drug
benefits, even though they partly replaced them with transitional
aid, raised serious questions about whether they were benevolent
enough to qualify as nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plight of these people persuades me there's a serious
problem here,'' he said.

MICHIGAN ST. WILL BEAT DUKE _ IN YOUR DREAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Five reasons Michigan State will beat
Duke:
</P>
<P>
   1. Dastardly defense: Sure, Duke leads the nation in scoring
(92.9) with a dynamic, balanced attack the Spartans can't come
close to matching. But it doesn't matter. Since the 3-point line
was introduced in 1987, the winner has averaged 80.3 points in the
title game. Nerves and pressure combine to slow the pace, and it
won't be any different today.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans are the best defensive team Duke has faced since
they met Dec. 2 in Chicago _ a 73-67 Blue Devils victory. Tough and
athletic, Michigan State has yielded an average of 57.8 points in
the NCAA Tournament and held opponents to a stifling 38.5 percent
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   When they slow the tempo and tighten the defensive clamp,
frustration takes a seat on the Duke bench.
</P>
<P>
   2. Historically speaking: No, it's got nothing to do with this
being the 20th anniversary of Michigan State's only national title.
Instead, the pertinent history dates to 1991, when Duke upset
mighty Nevada-Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point in that game came when Rebels point guard Greg
Anthony committed his fourth foul early in the second half. He
eventually fouled out with about five minutes left, leaving the
Rebels without their floor leader.
</P>
<P>
   Well, guess Duke's weakness _ its only weakness? The Blue Devils
don't have a backup point guard. When William Avery is tired or in
foul trouble, they use Trajan Langdon and Chris Carrawell as
makeshift points. That won't cut it today, when Michigan State
point guard Mateen Cleaves lures Avery into early foul trouble and
the Duke machine starts to sputter.
</P>
<P>
   3. Paging Mr. Chappell: The Spartans have insider knowledge of
Duke's system and personnel, courtesy of junior forward Mike
Chappell _ a Southfield (Mich.) native who transferred from Duke to
Michigan State in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Chappell played for Duke for two years, then bolted because of
scarce playing time. He sat out this season but has spent
considerable time discussing the Blue Devils' personnel and
explaining their offense. Some things don't show up on film.
</P>
<P>
   4. Loaded tank: One of Duke's greatest strengths is its depth,
which enables coach Mike Krzyzewski to keep his starters fresh and
overwhelm fatigued opponents in the second half. But Michigan State
has the depth (talented and experienced) to withstand Duke's
40-minute assault.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans' reserves _ leading scorer Morris Peterson, A.J.
Granger, Thomas Kelley and Doug Davis _ have outscored opposing
benches 26.5-14.9 this season. They outplayed Kentucky's respected
reserves 35-27, and they'll do the same thing today.
</P>
<P>
   5. Mighty Mateen: The only way to beat Duke is control tempo and
limit turnovers, which prevents the Blue Devils from scoring easy
transition baskets. It's a job for an elite point guard, a job for
Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-2, 195-pound Cleaves is a first-team Associated Press
All-American with a knack for performing under pressure. He's
strong with the ball and won't wilt against Duke's defense. He'll
control the pace and make sure the Spartans get good shots in their
half-court offense. And if the structure breaks down, Cleaves will
create scoring opportunities with his one-on-one skills....
</P>
<P>
   And one reason Michigan State will not beat Duke:
</P>
<P>
   _Margin for error: Duke has it, Michigan State does not. The
Blue Devils don't have to be at the top of their game, but the
Spartans must play flawlessly, especially in the second half. It
won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   A word on Romar: For peace of mind and financial security,
Lorenzo Romar had no choice but to leave Pepperdine and accept the
head coaching position at Saint Louis. He almost quadrupled his
salary, from $125,000 per year to $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   We'll miss his easy manner, his morality _ a rare commodity in
coaching _ and his deft touch with people. (He got Jelani Gardner
to play defense, after all.) Romar's genius is his ability to make
everyone around him feel important without sacrificing his
scruples. He's a great communicator and a better listener
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Pepperdine will find a better coach, but it won't find a
better man.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Cal played March the way most of us expected it
to play February....
</P>
<P>
   More evidence CBS analyst Billy Packer doesn't have a clue: in a
St. Petersburg Times story on the best coaches of all time, Packer
named (in order) John Wooden, Adolph Rupp, Bob Knight, Mike
Krzyzewski and Hank Iba.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Packer omitted Dean Smith, who stands with Wooden as
the greatest innovator of all time. Changing defenses and multiple
substitutions were two his many contributions....
</P>
<P>
   Now it's official. Pac-10: conference of (NIT) champions....
</P>
<P>
   Four words of advice for St. Mary's mammoth, albeit
tender-footer center, Russ Millard, who's considering a jump to the
NBA: Go big fella, go....
</P>
<P>
   How to screw up a coaching search, courtesy of San Diego State
athletic director Rick Bay: Waste your time pursuing Utah's Rick
Majerus, who was never going to take the job, and sacrifice
everything to find a ``name'' coach for your new arena.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it's Steve Fisher, the former Michigan man whose
teams had nearly as much trouble following NCAA rules as they did
executing fundamentals. What an awful hire.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DUKE vs. MICHIGAN STATE &QL; 
Backcourt: Duke's William Avery and Trajan Langdon form one of the
nation's top backcourts. Avery is a scoring point guard who can
dissolve defenses with penetration. His counterpart, Mateen
Cleaves, is quick and strong enough to withstand Duke's relentless
pressure. Limiting turnovers and getting good shots are the key to
Michigan State's survival. Edge: Duke  &QL; 
Frontcourt: Michigan State has a slew of role players (Antonio
Smith, Jason Klein, Andre Hutson) against Duke's brigade of
McDonald's All-Americans. If the Spartans are overly concerned with
Elton Brand (17.8 ppg), then Chris Carrawell and Shane Battier will
pounce on the opportunities. Edge: Duke  &QL; 
Bench: Both teams have great ones. Duke's includes freshman forward
Corey Maggette, a top NBA prospect. Michigan State forward Morris
Peterson is the nation's best sixth man; he leads the Spartans in
scoring (13.5 ppg) and was a first-team All-Big Ten selection. A.J.
Granger is the top 3-point threat. Edge: Even  &QL; 
Coaching: Duke's Mike Krzyzewski has two national titles and eight
Final Fours. Michigan State's Tom Izzo has none and one,
respectively. Edge: Duke  &QL; 
Outlook: Duke has manhandled everything in its path, but don't
expect this one to be easy. Duke has not played a close game since
Feb. 6 (at Georgia Tech). How will the Blue Devils react if this
one's tight? Edge: Duke by eight  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
OHIO STATE vs. UCONN &QL; 
Backcourt: Ohio State has the best in the country in Scoonie Penn
and Michael Redd, who combine for 36.8 points and 9.5 rebounds.
Both can shoot, score off the dribble and defend. Meanwhile,
Richard Hamilton is UConn's only dependable scorer. Ricky Moore is
its best defender and probably will guard Redd. Edge: Ohio State  &QL; 
Frontcourt: The realm of the role players, with Ohio State center
Ken Johnson as the great unknown. If he plays the way he did
against St. John's (12 points, seven blocks), the Buckeyes win.
UConn's Kevin Freeman is a prototypical power forward (12.6 ppg,
7.3 rpg) and Jake Voskuhl a solid center. Edge: Even  &QL; 
Bench: Ohio State uses four reserves who combine for 18 points;
forward George Reese is the best of the bunch. Albert Mouring (7.4
ppg) and Edmund Saunders lead the Huskies. Edge: Even  &QL; 
Coaching: Connecticut's Jim Calhoun has beaten Ohio State's Jim
O'Brien (formerly of Boston College) the last 18 times they've met.
But O'Brien has made all the right moves this season. Both are
making their first Final Four appearance, but the pressure's on
Calhoun. Edge: Ohio State  &QL; 
Outlook: O'Brien and Penn (ex-Boston College) know the UConn system
and personnel. Ohio State is playing better than its No.4 seed,
while UConn is playing worse than its No. 1. Edge: Ohio State by
six &QL;

   Growing Prospects Of Room at the Top &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated middle managers wondering if they will ever have a
chance to move up could be in for a pleasant surprise: Some
demographics of the workplace are turning in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   One-fifth of 260 companies surveyed by Development Dimensions
International, a human resources consultant in Bridgeville, Pa.,
say they expect to lose 40 percent or more of their executive
management by 2004 _ partly a reflection of baby boomers' nearing
the retirement age, according to William C. Byham, the firm's
founder. Their replacements, it seems, will come from a younger and
smaller population group _ and from a crop of middle managers
depleted by corporate downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   The companies in the survey ranged in size from 80 to 330,000
employees. Many of those businesses followed a national pattern of
large-scale hiring in the 1950s and 60s, as demand for goods and
services grew and boomers went to work. Now many of those workers
don't have many years before their retirement parties.
</P>
<P>
   The number of workers aged 35 to 44 _ typically the group that
is tapped to replace departing leaders _ will decline 5 percent
between 2001 and 2005, according to Census Bureau data. But the
Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the number of jobs
available to general managers and top executives will rise 10
percent to 35 percent, depending on the industry, by 2006. &QL;

   Redecorating on a Screen &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even when they have enough money to buy designer furniture,
shoppers can face a different squeeze: The item doesn't fit the
room and has to be returned. The Web site of the Herman Miller
Store (www.hmstore.com) has a room-planning feature that reduces
the hazard by letting users move chairs and tables around on a
floor plan before a truck arrives with the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   On the screen, users start with a floor plan scaled to a room's
dimensions and add stock diagrams to represent their existing
furniture. The payoff for Herman Miller comes when users browse
menus of its merchandise and fit in items like a compact sofa
designed by Charles and Ray Eames or a Meinecke Collection 7 rug.
</P>
<P>
   Furnishings by Herman Miller, which are sold in high-end stores,
can be expensive. The rug by Kurt Meinecke is $2,260, and the Eames
sofa is $2,526. All the more reason to minimize the chance of
having to send a selection back to the store and start shopping all
over again.

 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ David d'Alessandro is not your typical insurance
executive. Known for his jazzy ties, he once startled his sales
force with a videotape of himself and top aides pirouetting in
ballet tights. ``We wanted to get their attention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro, the president and chief operating officer of the
John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., seems to make a habit of
going against the grain. He roots for the Yankees in a town that
worships the Red Sox. Unlike many corporate executives, he shies
away from sports celebrities, figuring that getting caught up in
the glamour circuit could cloud his business judgment. He says he
prefers personal contact to e-mail, though he loves nothing more
than surfing the Web at 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   So it is no surprise that D'Alessandro is leading the corporate
charge to clean up one of the worst stains on the modern Olympics,
the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. It is a cause fraught with
controversy, and thus anathema to the corporate mind-set. But not
to D'Alessandro's.
</P>
<P>
   Because his company has spent millions to join its fate with
that of the Olympics, plastering the Games' logos on everything
from its advertising to its annual reports, D'Alessandro sees his
campaign as defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a matter of time before this splashes over onto the
corporate sponsors,'' he said in an interview last week in his
59th-floor office suite overlooking Boston Common. ``You can just
hear people saying, `What about you big fat-cat sponsors _ where's
your social responsibility?'''
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing defensive about his tone. Where once he
suggested changes in the International Olympics Committee, the
governing body of the games, he now makes demands: for the
resignation of Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC president; for an
end to lifelong appointments to the committee, and for an
independent investigation of allegations of corruption in Salt Lake
City's bid to win the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   While he has not withdrawn John Hancock's sponsorship of the
games, either in Sydney, Australia, next summer or in Salt Lake
City in 2002, D'Alessandro backs up his push for change with an
implicit threat. He has taken the Olympic logo off John Hancock's
billboards and TV advertising, and is keeping it off the 1998
annual report. He has also frozen negotiations on buying $20
million of TV advertising for the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 10 other corporate sponsors, which with John Hancock
contribute about $200 million annually to the games, have raised
concerns about the scandal. But, unlike D'Alessandro, who once was
so hard-nosed in a John Hancock labor dispute that he was given
police protection, they have pulled their punches.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro, 48, went on the warpath this month after
Samaranch, rather than taking much action, said he would study
reforms. ``They lied to us,'' D'Alessandro fulminated last week.
``They told us the scandal would be put behind us. But their
version of reform doesn't appear to be anybody else's.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro grew up in an apartment over his family's
delicatessen in Utica, N.Y. He is married and the father of three
sons, and he knows something about sports. He earned high school
letters in track and tennis, and his office walls are covered with
prized memorabilia like one of Joe Louis's punching bags (as well
as nonsports mementos like a Jimmy Cagney top hat).
</P>
<P>
   For D'Alessandro, who started at John Hancock in 1984 as the
company's chief spokesman, a lot is at stake. His career benefited
hugely from his campaign to make John Hancock the principal sponsor
of the Boston Marathon, and he was the prime mover in the decision
to concentrate most of the company's promotional budget on the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   After taking charge of sales in 1991 and revamping John
Hancock's way of doing business _ changing agents' pay structure
and going directly to customers by phone and the Internet _ he was
promoted to his current posts a year ago. He is expected to succeed
Stephen L. Brown when he retires as chairman and chief executive in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro doesn't want a festering problem at the IOC to
rekindle memories of the company's own brushes with scandal in the
last decade. Like most big life insurers, John Hancock was sued by
policyholders contending that they had been sold policies they did
not need; it ultimately settled for $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   It also paid $1.1 million to settle federal and Massachusetts
state charges that its lobbyists illegally gave state legislators
golf outings and other gifts.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro's main job these days is working with Brown on the
conversion of John Hancock from a mutual company, formally owned by
policyholders, to a publicly traded one next year. A public
relations disaster could hurt the price of the stock, making John
Hancock vulnerable to a hostile takeover.
</P>
<P>
   And D'Alessandro is determined not to let that happen. Though he
hopes the Olympics leadership will clean up its own act, he said,
``if they continue down the path they're on, we certainly won't
renew.''

A HANDSHAKE DEAL GONE BAD LEADS TO A BITTER LEGAL FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, March. 28)

 By ANDREW BLUTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARROAD, Minn. _ Bill Marvin can remember when a handshake and a
promise were good enough to do business with his company. That was
the way he built a small-town lumber company into the largest
custom window manufacturer in the world. Now a handshake deal gone
bad may prove to be the company's undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Still based in this tiny town six miles from Canada where Bill's
father, George Marvin, founded it in 1912, the privately held
Marvin Lumber and Cedar and its principal subsidiary, Marvin
Windows and Doors, now have 4,500 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Those include 12 members of the Marvin family, including Bill,
the chairman and chief executive, and his daughter Susan, the
president. Simple values are and always have been its way of
business, he says.
</P>
<P>
   One company that Bill Marvin shook hands with for decades was
PPG Industries, once known as Pittsburgh Plate Glass. Marvin and
Bob Ponchot, PPG's Minnesota sales representative, were longtime
fishing buddies.
</P>
<P>
   On a summer morning in 1984, Ponchot, Marvin and his son Jake,
now chief operating officer of the window company, met on Jake's
front lawn to hear Ponchot pitch a new product PPG was selling, a
wood preservative called PILT.
</P>
<P>
   The Marvins' decision to buy PILT set in motion a decade-long
chain of soured business dealings, finger-pointing and legal
wrangling that continues today. Bill and Bob's friendship doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   PILT was used on Marvin windows over four years in the mid-'80s.
A few years later, the company started getting customer complaints
about premature wood rot. Marvin Windows studied the rotting
windows and, based on when they were manufactured, concluded that
PILT was the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Windows told customers that even though the windows were
no longer under warranty, it would replace them at no charge, at a
cost to the company that has since run into the tens of millions of
dollars and last year forced Marvin Windows to cancel employees'
holiday bonuses for the first time since a catastrophic plant fire
in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Marvin asked PPG to help cover the costs. To his shock, PPG
refused.
</P>
<P>
   According to its lawyer, PPG told Marvin Windows that its own
analysis found PILT blameless, and that other window makers had
used the preservative without problems. PPG said Marvin Windows had
simply been growing too fast and was churning out faulty windows
just to keep up. And besides, PPG asserted, there was no written
agreement obliging PPG to chip in.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by PPG's stance, and stung by what Marvin felt was a
betrayal by a longtime business partner, Marvin Windows sued PPG in
1994, claiming breach of contract, breach of warranty and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Since then a bitter legal and public-relations war has raged, in
and out of various courts and even in the Minnesota legislature,
with Marvin saying that PPG's recalcitrance and the cost of
replacing the rotting windows were a threat to the company's
survival.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, said Mike Nilan, the lead lawyer for PPG. ``They like
to tell you about a family-run business from a small town in
Minnesota who does business with a handshake,'' he said. ``That's a
pretty picture to paint, but it's simply not true. They are a
hundred-million-dollar international corporation with a long
history of litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the courts have agreed with PPG's stance. After four
years of arguments and depositions, the suit was thrown out in
January; Marvin is appealing the dismissal. U.S. District Judge Ann
D. Montgomery ruled that too much time _ more than four years _ had
elapsed after Marvin's last purchase of PILT for Marvin to sue over
breach of contract and that the facts of the case did not support a
claim of fraud, to which a longer time limit applies.
</P>
<P>
   Nilan said Marvin had only itself to blame: ``Experienced
merchants ought to be smart enough to write a contract outlining
who is responsible for what if the product they are buying doesn't
work properly. Marvin didn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Marvin said promises were made on Jake's lawn that summer
morning, and he had a right to rely on them. ``I'm very surprised
with the position PPG is taking,'' he said. ``We've never had a
written contract, and I don't think that's naive. They reneged on a
handshake deal and, simply speaking, that's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponchot, the PPG representative who Marvin said did the
promising, has retired; he said the situation saddened him. ``I was
very close with all the Marvins,'' he said. But he also resents
that they did not give PPG more credit for helping Marvin Windows
grow. ``I'd look Bill Marvin in the eye tomorrow and say that if it
were not for PPG's technology, they would still be a
nickel-and-dime operation.''
</P>
<P>
   After early rulings in the case cast doubt on the viability of
Marvin's claim of fraud, the company turned to the Minnesota
legislature. The Marvin family approached lawmakers in St. Paul
last year, urging passage of a special bill that would override
existing law and apply retroactively to include Marvin's claims.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced late in the session, the bill failed to pass before
the legislature adjourned, but the Marvins didn't give up. Saying a
legal defeat would likely put Marvin Windows, one of the state's
largest employers, out of business, the Marvin family pressed Arne
Carlson, then the governor of Minnesota, to call a special session
to get the bill through. This time, it passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marvin Windows is a constituent of mine,'' said Leroy Stumpf,
the state senator who sponsored the new bill. ``They are a great
corporate citizen and they needed help.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal magistrate advised Montgomery that the retroactive
aspect of the law was unconstitutional, and the law was ultimately
ignored in her ruling. Despite PPG's stance and the losing streak
in court, Susan Marvin said her company would replace rotted
windows whose owners have already reported the problem. But to
protect itself, the company has adopted a policy of offering
discounts, not free new windows, to customers who complain in the
future after their warranties expire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rely on the satisfaction of our customers in this
business,'' she said in an interview at the company's headquarters,
``and we're standing behind our products; that's just the right
thing to do.''

IRWIN TOPS 190 MPH FOR TEXAS POLE POSITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Kenny Irwin says that when he is running a
qualifying lap, he does not know the difference between 185 and 190
mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather not know miles per hour,'' Irwin said yesterday at
Texas Motor Speedway. ``We know seconds, whether it's 28 or 29.3 or
whatever. But that's what all the fans want to know, `You went 190
mph!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Irwin claimed the pole for tomorrow's Primestar
500 with a TMS record hot lap at 190.154 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Or in driver-talk, 28.398 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the magic numbers around the reconfigured, repaved
and really fast TMS on a day when 37 drivers exceeded Jeremy
Mayfield's former NASCAR Winston Cup pole record. Mayfield toured
the 1.5-mile quadoval in 29.047 seconds/185.906 mph April 4, the
morning after qualifying had been postponed by water seeping out of
Turn 1.
</P>
<P>
   Recent open testing indicated that the revamped layout could
raise speeds by 2 or 3 mph. Both defending race champion Mark
Martin and Geoffrey Bodine posted practice speeds in excess of 190
yesterday, but the effects of the revisions to the entrance into
Turn 1 and the exit out of Turn 4 did not show up on the speed
chart until the official qualifying session.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin was the only driver to break the 190 barrier when it
counted, but the injured Bobby Labonte just missed with a hot lap
at 189.853 mph., second-fastest in qualifying. Row 2 is filled by
second-year driver Steve Park at 189.341 mph and native Texan Terry
Labonte, Bobby's big brother, who ran 189.122.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fast,'' said Irwin, driver of the No. 28
Texaco/Havoline Ford Taurus. ``I would have never guessed we were
that fast.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the physical changes made to the track, Cup cars
also are running here for the first time under NASCAR's revised
aerodynamic changes to the ``5-and-5 Rules.'' The Cup cars now have
taller rear spoilers and lower front air dams, changes designed to
make them more stable _ and faster _ through the 24-degree banked
turns.
</P>
<P>
   But Irwin left no doubt where the biggest improvements have been
made since last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's all the racetrack,'' said Irwin, who notched his
second career Cup pole in his 42nd start. ``I think the changes
they made in \Rturns\S 1 and 2 are the biggest reasons. Very little
to the rules. I think the type of speeds that we get on one lap
doesn't affect it as much as during the race with the 5-and-5, the
way it was last year. The track is just faster. I'd say
everything's better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte, who broke the tip of his right scapula (shoulder
blade) in a practice crash at Darlington Raceway last Friday,
gutted it out to gain the second spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't complain about that,'' said Labonte, driver of the No.
18 Interstate Batteries Pontiac Grand Prix. ``It's tough getting in
and out of the car, but once I get in there it's OK. I'm taking it
one lap at a time right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, who ran 43 laps at Darlington last Sunday before giving
way to Busch Grand National regular Matt Kenseth, has been
undergoing therapy treatments on his shoulder all week with
trainers from the NFL's Carolina Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think \Rtoday\S how I feel in practice is the big key,''
said Labonte, referring to his game plan for race day. ``I'll be
running more laps, and there's a lot more of a load here on your
side and body than at Darlington. We'll have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Park, meanwhile, posted his career-best Cup qualifying effort.
His previous best had been 23rd at the Daytona International
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just need a lot of guts'' to qualify at TMS, said Park,
driver of the No. 1 Pennzoil Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``We've been
working on our car and working on the driver to figure out what I
really need to go faster in qualifying.''
</P>
<P>
   The fast four were followed in the top 10 by Ward Burton,
Martin, Ken Schrader, reigning Cup champion Jeff Gordon, Bill
Elliott and Wally Dallenbach Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Included among the 25 drivers who locked up starting spots
yesterday was Jeff Burton, winner of the first Cup race here in
1997 and the current points leader. He is 20th on the grid.
Mayfield broke his own record from last year, but his speed of
186.477 mph was only good for 29th.
</P>
<P>
   Seven-time Cup champion Dale Earnhardt stands 38th, the first
driver not to exceed Mayfield's former record. And three-time
series champion Darrell Waltrip, who is out of provisionals and
needs to crack the top 36 on speed to start the race, will be 46th
when second-round qualifying starts today.

THE NUMBERS MAY CHANGE, BUT NOT THE OPTIMISM  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of these years Abby Joseph Cohen, a managing director and
chief investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs, is going to change
her tune about the stock market. But it's not going to be this
year. Indeed, barring unforeseen developments, it seems that her
largely positive view on equities will be in place in Y2K, too.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Cohen turned some heads last week when she issued an
updated market forecast that raised her 1999 targets for the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index even as she lowered her estimates
on corporate per-share operating profits.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, she took some time to discuss the apparent
discrepancy and other matters related to her conviction that stock
prices are going higher in the months ahead. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can the market do better than you thought it would
before, if profits aren't going to be as good as you expected? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We revise our forecasts every March, after we have had the
chance to spend some time with full-year economic and profit
information. Not all of the S&AMP;P 500 companies have finished
reporting, but we had enough data to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   After we looked at the numbers, we recognized what we have been
saying for several months _ namely, that our estimates of 1998
profits were too high. So, we sliced about $3 off our 1998 profit
numbers. That changed our baseline for 1999, and we are now working
off a lower base. At the same time, we told our clients we are
feeling better about the trajectory of profits going forward based
on the evidence we now have. That is largely because the global
economy is starting to look better. We aren't as enthusiastic about
the rest of the world as we are about the United States, but we are
feeling better.
</P>
<P>
   Modestly raising our price targets on the market reflects a
clearer view on the next 12 months. And we think 2000 will be a
good year as well. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Many investors worry about the lack of breadth in the market,
that the gains are concentrated among a few big-cap stocks. Are
those concerns justified? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We have been going through a very peculiar period of time. In
the spring of 1997, investors thought all was right with the world.
There was a perception the global economy was doing well. During
that period we had a broad market, when the small- and mid-caps
performed reasonably well and the so-called value stocks were
performing better.
</P>
<P>
   That sense lasted for about three months, and then Thailand woke
people up to the fact there is risk out there. That made people
nervous, and convinced portfolio managers to stay in large liquid
names that gave them the chance to get out fairly easily.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1998, small- and mid-cap stocks once again
started to do better, and the market started to broaden again. Then
came the events of August, when Russia defaulted. Those events
pushed investors back into large, liquid names.
</P>
<P>
   This year, if we have an environment in which the U.S. economy
is steady and the global economy is getting better, not worse, that
may instill investor confidence. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. That said, don't you find that a lot of the market's
best-known, biggest-cap names are selling at extremely high
prices? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Throughout the S&AMP;P 500 there are quite a few outstanding
companies that deserve to be selling at price/earnings multiples
that are higher than the overall market. The difficulty is
identifying companies that are better values than others. In
technology, for example, there is a great deal of enthusiasm for
big companies. Yet IBM is selling at a price that is below the
market's price/earnings ratio. Another technology company selling
below the market multiple is Dell. They have a terrific business
model they have used on their product and are now using it to get
into other product lines. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What other sectors do you like? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Last year, we thought the strength in the U.S. economy would
help cyclical stocks that would benefit from improved consumer
confidence, like retailing and consumer durables like autos and
personal computers. We think there will be a continuation of that
this year, but the year-over-year earnings comparisons will be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The one global sector we like is energy. Last fall, we felt the
energy fundamentals were bad but weren't going to get any worse.
Energy companies could still lose money this year, but if they lose
less it would be a boost to overall S&AMP;P earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Bank stocks were very hard-hit in August and September, and even
though they have done better they are still trading at a discount
to the market. BankAmerica and Bank One are two companies that we
think represent value.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What would darken your view? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It would take real economic deterioration to upset things
here. We have had market upsets, but they were not economic events.
At the moment, there are no notable signs of deterioration. But we
keep watching for them, like everybody else.

STRICTER RULES ARE URGED ON USE OF A DIABETES DRUG  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, N.J.)   By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ Amid reports of deaths and serious liver damage
caused by the diabetes drug Rezulin, a panel of scientific experts
Friday recommended that the government place stricter limits on the
use of the drug, and urged that patients take it only when other
therapies have failed.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of votes, the committee stopped short of
recommending that the drug be withdrawn from the market, as some
consumer safety advocates had urged. Instead, the panel told the
Food and Drug Administration that Rezulin, which is used by about
750,000 Americans, should not be used on its own unless the label
is changed to warn patients that it carries very grave risks.
</P>
<P>
   Even with this restriction, some panel members seemed uneasy
with their decision. ``I'm very uncomfortable about it,'' one
member, Dr. Jules Hirsch of Rockefeller University in New York
City, said after the vote. ``I think some of these people are going
to get liver failure.''
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation is not binding, although the FDA generally
follows the advice of its outside experts. It came after a
contentious daylong hearing at which agency officials and the
drug's manufacturer offered wildly different estimates of Rezulin's
risks. Endocrinologists, who specialize in treating diabetes,
begged the panel to leave the drug on the market, while consumer
safety advocates characterized Rezulin as a threat to public
health.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing provided the first public accounting of the reports
of deaths and injuries caused by the use of Rezulin. The FDA and
the manufacturer agreed that 43 patients had suffered acute liver
failure that was possibly due to Rezulin.
</P>
<P>
   Of these, 28 died, seven required liver transplants and five
recovered. The outcome of three others was unknown. But the agency
and the manufacturer could not agree on whether those reports
represent the sum total of the harm the drug has caused or is
capable of causing.
</P>
<P>
   Rezulin, made by Parke-Davis, a division of the Warner-Lambert
Co. of Morris Plains, N.J., has been prescribed to 1.58 million
people in the United States since it was introduced in March 1997.
Known generically as troglitazone, it is the first in a promising
new class of medicine designed to treat Type II diabetes, the adult
onset form of the disease, which afflicts an estimated 15 million
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   About four-fifths of all patients who use the drug do so in
combination with other diabetes drugs, and the committee found that
when used that way, the benefits of Rezulin still outweigh the
risks. Parke-Davis was pleased with that finding and said it should
give doctors ``renewed confidence'' in the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's hearing, which was jammed with reporters,
pharmaceutical executives, doctors and patients, marked the fourth
time the food and drug agency has re-evaluated Rezulin; on three
previous occasions it has issued warnings about the drug and
advised doctors to monitor their patients closely. Parke-Davis
officials maintained that the risk of liver problems has plummeted
since last July, when the FDA issued the most recent warning.
Company officials said the risk of developing liver failure is now
1 in 57,000, compared to 1 in 36,000 previously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Approximately 100 patients with diabetes have died since the
beginning of this meeting,'' Dr. Robert Zerbe, the company's senior
vice president of clinical research, told the committee. ``These
patients desperately need medications to help them control their
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. David Graham, an epidemiologist for the agency, said
that the risks of Rezulin appeared much higher than previously
believed and that the drug became more dangerous the longer a
patient took it. He calculated that only 10 percent of all cases of
acute liver failure had been reported. ``I think the number is
closer to 400 than it is to 43,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking into account the underreporting, Graham predicted that
one out of every 1,800 patients who used Rezulin for six months
would have serious liver failure. By comparison, he said, the
average person's risk of developing acute liver failure is one in a
million, about equal to the risk of being struck by lightning.
``What we see,'' he told the committee, ``isn't reassuring.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred people attended Friday's meeting in a ballroom
at the Holiday Inn here. The room was so crowded the FDA had to set
up a closed-circuit television in the hotel's second-floor lobby to
accommodate the overflow.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, a parade of endocrinologists lauded the drug's
benefits. ``Asking people to treat diabetes now without Rezulin,''
said Dr. William Clark of Houston, ``would be like asking a coach
to win a track meet after cutting off one leg on all of his
athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there a shortage of patients willing to testify to the
drug's benefits. Robert Andersen, 78, a retired government worker
and part-time farmer in Westerlo, N.Y., said he had been taking the
drug since it was approved. The drug helped stabilize his blood
sugar, which he said previously fluctuated dramatically, sometimes
leaving him feeling dangerously weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had incidents late at night milking cows,'' he said. ``When
I got that clammy feeling, I barely made it back to the house. I
was weakened out. It was a risky matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Diabetes Association estimates there are 16 million
patients with diabetes in the United States, 15 million of them
with Type II diabetes, the adult-onset form of the disease.
Diabetes is the nation's seventh-leading cause of death and a
leading cause of heart disease, stroke, blindness and limb
amputations. In Type II diabetes, patients develop resistance to
insulin, the hormone that controls blood sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Rezulin is the first, and so far the only, FDA-approved
medication in a new class of drugs, and experts say it is the first
diabetes drug to control blood sugar levels by attacking the
underlying cause of the disease. The FDA recommends that doctors
who prescribe Rezulin monitor their patients' liver function every
month for at least eight months, but whether those warnings were
heeded was the subject of intense debate Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Parke-Davis presented data showing that most patients receive
the monitoring. But Graham, drawing from records provided by an
insurance company, United Health Care, said only 2.7 percent of
patients who had taken Rezulin for three months were monitored
according to FDA recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   But the company said that United Health's Care's data were
incomplete and that most patients did get the monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting data frustrated the panel. ``We are seriously in
need of new information,'' complained Hirsch, the panel member from
Rockefeller University. ``I have almost never had a meeting here
that so confounded me.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to improve the monitoring, Parke-Davis plans to
issue its own warnings about Rezulin, telling patients who have a
history of liver problems not to take the drug. The company plans
to send monthly reminders to doctors telling them to test their
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the committee voted that the benefits of the drug
when used in combination with other medicine still outweigh the
risks, Zerbe, the company's research executive, said doctors should
have ``renewed confidence'' in Rezulin.

EDITORIAL: RUSSIA AND THE IMF 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, March 27:
</P>
<P>
   When Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov hastily canceled
his trip to Washington this week in protest against the air war on
Yugoslavia, it was understood that his planned discussion with the
International Monetary Fund could not be long delayed. Russia's
financial situation is desperate.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was quickly relocated from the United States to
Moscow, where Michael Camdessus, the head of the IMF, is talking
this weekend with Primakov and other Russian officials. While no
final decision on lending is expected, the fund should favorably
consider Moscow's minimum request for $4.8 billion to cover
interest due on existing IMF and World Bank loans. Without IMF
help, Moscow would default on its international debts, as it
already has on its domestic loans.
</P>
<P>
   Such a default would do nothing to advance reform in Russia and
could make matters worse. Specifically, it could destabilize a
government that has maintained constitutional order and conducted a
generally responsible foreign policy. Despite current tensions over
Yugoslavia, Primakov has been nudging Russia's parliament to ratify
the 1993 treaty with Washington that would eliminate some 3,500
Russian nuclear warheads now capable of reaching the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it would be reckless to lend new money to Russia without
proper safeguards. As part of any deal, the fund should take
precautions to see that the money is not diverted for private gain
as some previous loans appear to have been. That can be avoided
this time by handling any new loan as an internal accounting
transfer, with the funds electronically moved from one side of IMF
and World Bank ledgers to the other.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF will have to walk away unless Russia can offer credible
plans to further tighten its fiscal policy through better tax
collection and new spending cuts. Primakov has already persuaded
parliament to pass the most austere budget in four years. But
satisfying the IMF will require stronger tax collection measures
than the Primakov government has been willing to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   No significant new economic reforms in Russia are likely until
after presidential elections scheduled for next year. Until then,
as long as Moscow keeps working to narrow its budget gap, it should
be lent just enough to stave off a ruinous default.

 &HT;    Making sure home medicines aren't hazardous to your health
 &HT;    By Michele Chan Santos
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Open up your medicine cabinet. What do you see?
If you're like many people, what's there isn't reassuring: old
prescription bottles, half-empty containers of expired aspirin, a
couple of cotton balls, a caked bottle of foundation you must have
bought in '88, a travel-size toothpaste, some Vicks VapoRub from
when your grandmother was visiting, a mystery mascara, a dusty vial
of Old Spice.
</P>
<P>
   Odds are that the contents wouldn't help someone who needed
first aid _ or even someone with a sore throat. A combo cleanup and
stock-up will mean you'll be ready when someone in your family
comes down with the flu, gets an insect bite or has food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to throw out all the expired stuff, or
anything that looks suspiciously old. (It's a bad sign if you can't
remember when you bought it or if the liquid or pill has changed
color.) Also, that old mascara may be the most toxic thing in your
bathroom. Mascara, eyeliner and eye makeup remover more than six
months old should be thrown in the trash. They're easily
contaminated and may cause severe eye infections.
</P>
<P>
   Next, figure out what you need, using our guide. Once it's
updated, go through the cabinet every six months or so, weeding out
the expired stuff. Another good idea is to purchase a first-aid kit
and have one in your car or with your camping equipment (if you're
going to a remote area, you might want to get a snakebite kit, too.
They're available at sporting-goods and outdoor-recreation stores).
</P>
<P>
   The last step is to make sure your medicines and cosmetics can't
get into curious young hands: More than 1 million children younger
than 6 are poisoned each year this way. Most inadvertently got into
their parents' personal care products or makeup, or consumed huge
amounts of aspirin, laxatives or vitamins, which to them might look
like candy. Lock it up.
</P>
<P>
   What should be in your medicine cabinet?
</P>
<P>
   Experts recommend:
</P>
<P>
   _ An analgesic (like aspirin), acetaminophen (like Tylenol), or
ibuprofen (like Advil), to reduce pain and fever.
</P>
<P>
   _ Band-Aids, bandages or gauze pads, for cuts and wounds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Adhesive tape, to fasten bandages.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alcohol prep pads, for disinfection.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hydrogen peroxide, to clean wounds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Antibiotic ointment, to treat scrapes and cuts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Antacid, Pepcid AC or other treatment for upset stomach.
</P>
<P>
   _ Immodium AD or another diarrhea treatment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Benadryl or another antihistamine, for allergic reactions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Oral and rectal thermometers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Q-Tips and cotton balls.
</P>
<P>
   _ Heating pad.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hydrocortisone cream, for rashes, insect bites or burns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tweezers, without teeth, to remove splinters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gel pack, to use as an ice or heating pack.
</P>
<P>
   _ After Bite or similar treatment for insect bites or stings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Caladryl, Cortizone-5, Lanacane or another product with
benzocaine or calamine lotion, for poison ivy, poison oak and
poison sumac.
</P>
<P>
   If you have young children, add:
</P>
<P>
   _ Syrup of ipecac, to induce vomiting if a child has swallowed
something poisonous (use this only with the advice of a medical
professional. It is not recommended in all cases).
</P>
<P>
   _ Diaper cream.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rubber bulb syringe, to clear out an infant's stuffy nose.
</P>
<P>
   _ Oral rehydration solution, like Pedialyte, to help dehydrated
children.
</P>
<P>
   _ Petroleum jelly, to lubricate a rectal thermometer or
moisturize dry skin.
</P>
<P>
   _ A liquid antihistamine like Benadryl.
</P>
<P>
   _ Liquid Motrin.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chewable Tylenol.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Children should not take aspirin because of the risk of
Reye's syndrome, particularly when they have the flu or chicken
pox. Reye's syndrome is a rare but serious illness that may follow
a viral infection. It can cause stomach upset, intestinal bleeding,
disorientation and lethargy leading to coma. Children should be
given acetaminophen instead.
</P>
<P>
   If you have an elderly person in the home:
</P>
<P>
   _ A laxative like Metamucil, because many prescription medicines
are constipating.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cream for osteoarthritis.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prescription medications. (The best place for many medicines,
pharmacists say, is not the bathroom medicine cabinet, which can be
hot and humid, but a cool, dry shelf or cabinet.) You should have
at least a two-week supply on hand.
</P>
<P>
   _ Glucose tablets for diabetics.
</P>
<P>
   _ A list of prescription medications. Take the list with you on
trips; keep it handy in your home to give to a doctor or emergency
personnel if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   How long do medicines stay effective?
</P>
<P>
   _ Check all products for expiration dates. Discard anything that
is expired.
</P>
<P>
   _ You should not have any prescription antibiotic left over.
Take the whole prescription each time; don't stop just because you
feel better. If you do have leftover antibiotics in your bathroom,
throw them out. Some, like tetracyline, can break down into toxic
substances.
</P>
<P>
   _ You can keep leftover pain medication (for example, Vicodin.)
It's safe to use it until the expiration date, if someone has a
broken bone and needs a painkiller. It should be reserved for
emergencies and severe pain. For common headaches or muscular
aches, stick with aspirin or acetaminophen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Leftover prescription diarrhea medication stays good for a
couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Call a pharmacist if you are not sure if the medicine you have
is still good.
</P>
<P>
   _ It is illegal to give prescription medication to someone it
wasn't prescribed for.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask the pharmacist to put the expiration date on the label of
any prescribed medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Other items in your home that are helpful in an emergency:
</P>
<P>
   _ Disposable or regular diapers: Use as a compress to control
bleeding or as a padding for splints.
</P>
<P>
   _ Towels, sheets, linens: Can substitute for bandages or a
compress.
</P>
<P>
   _ Diaper or safety pins: Pin bandages or slings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Large scarf or handkerchief: Use as an eye bandage or a sling.
</P>
<P>
   _ Magazines, newspapers, umbrella, pillow: Double as splints for
broken bones.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fan: Cool heatstroke victim.
</P>
<P>
   Keep these emergency numbers next to your phone:
</P>
<P>
   _ 911
</P>
<P>
   _ Poison Control Center, answered 24 hours a day: 1-800-POISON-1
(1-800-764766-1).
</P>
<P>
   _ Your own address and phone number (for a baby sitter or
visitor who might be calling 911)
</P>
<P>
   _ Pediatrician.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dentist.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hospital emergency department.
</P>
<P>
   _ Next-door neighbors

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After weeks of protests over the combative police
policies of the administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Police
Commissioner Howard Safir on Friday unveiled major changes in the
street crime unit aimed at averting confrontations like that in
which four white officers gunned down Amadou Diallo, an unarmed
black man, last month.
</P>
<P>
   Safir, reflecting Giuliani's more conciliatory approach to the
biggest crisis of his tenure, said that 50 of the 380 officers in
the overwhelmingly white plainclothes unit would be replaced with
minority members, and that all its officers hereafter would work in
uniform to minimize potentially deadly confusion in heat-of-the
moment faceoffs on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said the unit, whose members roam in unmarked cars
searching for crimes and suspected robbers, rapists and gunmen, has
made 67 percent fewer arrests since the shooting of Diallo on Feb.
4. The unit has been widely accused of stopping an inordinate
number of black and Hispanic citizens, many of whom tell of abuses
by officers who might be mistaken for street toughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thinking is that the community's concerns were that street
crime officers in plainclothes were not necessarily recognizable,''
Safir said at a news conference after another day of protests
outside Police Headquarters, where the Rev. Jesse Jackson was one
of 216 people arrested, bringing the total arrested to 1,009 over
the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As more than a thousand people chanted and cheered under a warm
spring sun, embracing reports that a Bronx grand jury had indicted
the four street crime officers on murder charges in the death of
Diallo, there seemed to be a change in the mood of the crowd, from
anger and vitriol to one of victory and even pride in what had been
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to jail for the American dream,'' Jackson told the crowd
before submitting to the plastic handcuffs and the orchestrated
arrest. ``This is a great day. This is a day of joy. This is a day
of hope. Diallo bore the crucifixion in his body. That crucifixion
has been turned to resurrection.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who has held a series of meetings with minority
leaders in recent days and has changed a caustic and dismissive
tone to one more balanced and conciliatory, met at Gracie Mansion,
his official residence, on Friday night with 10 members of the City
Council's Black and Latino caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, facing reporters, the mayor was soft-spoken, almost
contrite, as he described the meeting as ``the beginning of an
important dialogue in which we come to a better understanding of
how to deal with the difficult situations that confront us.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he should have met with the group earlier, Giuliani,
who has never cultivated close ties to black and Hispanic elected
and civic leaders in the city, said: ``Sure, I wish we'd had this
meeting earlier. It might be I made a mistake in not having more
meetings like this.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after the reported indictments, as the mayor scheduled
more meetings with minority leaders, including the state
comptroller, H. Carl McCall, and as Safir outlined reforms in the
street crimes unit, the Diallo case, which has dominated the
political dialogue in New York for seven weeks, seemed subtly to
have turned a corner.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, at a breakfast in Manhattan, reiterated a
backhanded rebuke of the mayor and Safir. He praised both for ``an
outstanding job'' that had made ``the safest streets since the
'60s.'' But he added: ``We have to listen to those who disagree
with us. We have to accept criticism. We have to be willing to have
a dialogue, even when we ultimately disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   City Comptroller Alan Hevesi, a Democrat who is expected to run
for mayor when Giuliani departs, said at a luncheon Friday that he
used to think that racism in the Police Department was limited and
sporadic, but that he had now come to believe that there was a
``systemic'' problem in some communities, and that the mayor and
his opponents needed to ``swallow their hostility toward one
another'' and work out problems together.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx district attorney, Robert Johnson, refused again
Friday, as he had on Thursday, to confirm reports that the four
officers _ Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Kenneth Boss and Richard
Murphy _ had been indicted on second-degree homicide charges in the
death of Diallo, who was slain in a hail of 41 bullets outside his
building at 1157 Wheeler Ave. in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, on the advice of their lawyer, never testified
before the grand jury and thus offered no justification for the
shooting. While they have never said publicly what happened, a
lawyer who represented them early in the case said they believed
Diallo had a gun, and shot him in self-defense. Although the
indictments remain sealed, a lawyer with knowledge of the case and
a law-enforcement official confirmed Thursday night that the grand
jury had voted the indictments, and they noted Friday that the
indictments probably would be unsealed on Tuesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials who spoke on condition of anonymity cited several
possible reasons for Johnson's delay in making the indictments
public.
</P>
<P>
   For one, they said, the prosecutor hoped that Diallo's family
would be in court for the arraignment. Diallo's mother and other
family members were expected to arrive in New York from Conakry,
Guinea, on Monday, and would not be available for court proceedings
before Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, moreover, another notorious case against four
white police officers _ these accused of attacking the Haitian
immigrant Abner Louima last year _ is to open with jury selection
in federal court in Brooklyn on Monday, and Marvyn Kornberg, who
represents Carroll in the Diallo case, must be there because he
also represents an officer in the Louima case.
</P>
<P>
   Other reasons for delaying the unsealing, officials said, are
technical and logistical. Many details remain to be worked out for
the surrender of the officers, who would most likely turn
themselves in at a Bronx precinct station house, where their
arrests would be processed, and then be transferred to state
Supreme Court on the Grand Concourse for arraignment. They have
been assigned to desk duty, but would be suspended when the
indictments are made public.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, officials said, the Bronx district attorney is probably
proceeding with great caution to draw up the indictments properly
to avoid any procedural errors. When Officer Francis Livoti was
first indicted in 1994 in the death of Anthony Baez, on whom he was
said to have used an illegal choke-hold, the indictment was thrown
out because of a clerical error in its drafting.
</P>
<P>
   Safir, who has been under fire himself for traveling to
California during the growing protests, said at his news conference
Friday that 50 of the officers presently assigned to the street
crime unit would be transferred to robbery squads and replaced with
minority members, dramatically transforming the composition of the
unit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to placing all the unit's officers into uniform,
making them instantly recognizable to the public, the commissioner
said he intended to give the officers more supervision, changing
the ratio of one supervisor for every four officers to one
supervisor for every three officers. Moreover, he said, all the
unit's members will be promoted to detective-specialists, giving
them a raise in pay. He did not specify the amount.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had ordered the changes after meetings with various
community and political leaders, including one Friday with C.
Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, who has been
among the most ardent critics.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said that in the seven weeks since the Diallo shooting,
the street crimes unit had recorded a precipitous drop in arrests _
to 291 from 705 in the same period a year earlier, a decline of 67
percent. The number of stop-and-frisk reports filled out by
officers also has dropped sharply. Meanwhile, he said, there has
been an increase in shootings in those areas where the unit
operates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only speculate to the fact that the individuals in
street crime are concerned about taking enforcement action for
being criticized,'' Safir said. ``The media has been relentless on
vilifying street crime, and I think that this has definitely had an
effect.''

TALKING YOUR WAY TO CAREER FAILURE 
LOOK WHO'S JOINING THE INTERNET PARADE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Kan., N.Y., Ohio, Va.) (FOR RELEASE Sunday, March. 28) 
 (rk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you were thinking it was the crucial assignment you
flubbed, or the glaring gap in your resume, or petty politics in
your office, or even illegal discrimination that was holding you
back from the rapid career advancement you crave.
</P>
<P>
   No, no, no, according to one of the latest secrets-of-success
books: It's how fast you talk.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Benton, a consultant from Fort Collins, Colo., is
promoting her new book, ``Secrets of a CEO Coach'' (McGraw-Hill),
by releasing a list of the ``Top Five Self-Sabotaging Behaviors
People Do to Hurt Their Career Advancement.''
</P>
<P>
   On the list are: talking too fast (``Makes what you say seem
unimportant''), giving others too much detailed information, being
judgmental of others, being too self-critical and using weak body
language and a timid tone of voice.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Benton offers by way of explanation that most people think
working harder is all that matters, but that bosses are looking for
``executive maturity as expressed in behaviors.'' What effect the
habitual use of irritating jargon like ``behaviors'' might have on
a person's career, Ms. Benton omits to mention.
</P>
<P>
   Look Who's Joining The Internet Parade
</P>
<P>
   The Internet seems to have an odd catnip quality for political
heavyweights, and vice versa. Vice President Al Gore hardly had
time to live down his widely ridiculed recent remarks seeming to
claim partial credit for inventing cyberspace, when along came word
that a hot Internet stock has added none other than Bob Dole to its
board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   OneMain.com went public last week in rather spectacular fashion,
raising $187 million, nearly doubling its stock price on its first
day of trading and closing on Friday at $32, up 45.5 percent from
its offering price of $22. The year-old company buys up Internet
service providers in places like Portsmouth, Ohio, and Winfield,
Kan., that are well away from major metropolitan areas; it has
acquired or agreed to acquire 17 so far, with about 331,000
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The digits-to-the-heartland strategy seems to be what attracted
Dole, who few would call an avatar of technofuturism, to the
company, only the second board he has joined. (The other is TB
Wood's, a utility equipment maker.)
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the company seems attracted to powerful
connections: A Harvard Business School professor, Thomas Eisenmann,
is one of Dole's two fellow outside directors, and the company is
relocating from Long Island, N.Y. to the Washington suburb of
Reston, Va.

 &HT;    Lady Bulldogs leashed by Duke
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ As suddenly as Georgia jumped back into a
Final Four semifinal contest in which it never really had any
control, the Lady Bulldogs gave it right back to Duke in a critical
sequence in the second half Friday, losing 81-69 as the Blue Devils
poured grease on the fire in the closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia (27-7), totally flustered by Duke's swarming perimeter
pressure defense, showed its youth at the worst possible time. The
Lady Dogs' hopes of delivering a national title to coach Andy
Landers after five Final Four trips withered away in the last 9:10
before a capacity crowd of 17,709 at San Jose Arena. Duke limited
Georgia to 33 percent shooting in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Erickson led Duke with 22 points, Michele VanGorp had 20
and Georgia Schweitzer 13. Georgia's Miller twins were shut down
most of the game, although Coco Miller scored 18 and Kelly Miller
13. Tawana McDonald had 14 and Deana Nolan added 12.
</P>
<P>
   Duke (29-6), which upset Tennessee in the East Regional finals
to get here, proved it is no fluke. The Durham, N.C. school is now
in the enviable position of having a chance of being to become the
first in NCAA Division I history to win men's and women's national
basketball championships in the same season.
</P>
<P>
   After digging themselves a 15-point hole early in the second
half, the Bulldogs made several modest comebacks
</P>
<P>
   Georgia got to within six at 60-54, but then Kiesha Brown took
two ill-advised jumpers and committed a foul that gave Duke a 64-54
cushion at the 7:38 mark. With under six minutes to play, Erickson
scored on a baseline drive and then nailed a 3-pointer for a 70-55
lead.

CORPORATE PROFITS ARE TASTY, BUT ARTIFICIALLY FLAVORED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 28) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Md.)   (af)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE

   The winter quarter ends on Wednesday, and as the crocuses
emerge, public attention turns to profits. The stock market in the
coming weeks will ride _ up or down _ on the quarterly profit
reports that will spew forth soon from corporate America. Will
those reports signal continuing economic strength? If so, is
corporate America reporting its profits truthfully?
</P>
<P>
   That may seem a startling question to pose in the United States.
Crony capitalists in emerging countries may inflate profits
irresponsibly without raising eyebrows. But the phenomenon is
popping up right here in disciplined America, and not just among a
handful of black-sheep companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear we are witnessing a gradual, but noticeable, erosion in
the quality of financial reporting,'' Arthur Levitt, chairman of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, said last week, repeating a
diagnosis that first appeared in his speeches last fall.
</P>
<P>
   That icon of business, Warren Buffett, has also weighed in,
rather bluntly. Like Levitt, he blames the stock market for
pressuring chief executives into reporting ever higher earnings so
that their companies' stock prices will keep up with the
ever-rising market, like a cat chasing its tail. They try to
achieve the necessary earnings legitimately, Buffett wrote
recently, but when they fail to do so, they ``resort to unadmirable
accounting strategems'' that ``manufacture the desired
`earnings.'''
</P>
<P>
   The potential damage is alarming. Profits have climbed rapidly
in recent years, and this growth has contributed mightily to the
stock market's euphoria and to the impression that corporate
America has outclassed other countries in the global economy.
Rising profits, in fact, have become an emblem of the nation's
apparent success.
</P>
<P>
   And now the emblem may be less than advertised _ considerably
less, if enough companies, prodded by the SEC, find themselves
forced to change their accounting practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that, on average, reported profits are
overstated,'' said Baruch Lev, a professor of accounting at New
York University's Stern School of Business. ``My intuition tells me
that profitability in the United States is basically solid, but
there is a layer of earnings that is illusionary.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has quantified how many billions would disappear if
accounting practices changed, but there are hints. One gimmick
involves the stock options that corporations increasingly award to
executives as a way to fatten pay. Under current accounting rules,
those options do not have to be listed as a cost and subtracted
from earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the large companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index gave out $10.4 billion in options without reporting
them as compensation expense. That was 3 percent of the companies'
$325 billion in after-tax earnings, so their actual earnings were
closer to $315 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Stock options are relatively easy to track; they appear as
footnotes in reports filed with the SEC. Jack Ciesielski of R.G.
Associates in Baltimore, which researches accounting issues, came
up with the $10.4 billion figure by going through the filings.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger source of overstated profits _ corporate restructuring
charges _ is harder to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a big corporation that announces a $2 billion
restructuring charge to cover the cost of integrating a newly
acquired company and the cost of severance for laid-off workers.
The $2 billion is all charged against this year's earnings, making
them look bad, although the actual costs are spread out over two or
three years.
</P>
<P>
   But the $2 billion is intentionally overestimated; the actual
cost turns out to be $1.5 billion. And the company has a de facto
$500 million reserve that is fed gradually into quarterly earnings
reports, making net income seem to rise robustly.
</P>
<P>
   From news reports last year, Ciesielski's firm tracked 1,400
restructuring charges totaling $76 billion. ``I think that is a
light figure,'' he said. ``We probably missed quite a few.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And there are other ways to make profits seem bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate executives increasingly manipulate charges related to
research and development and to depreciation, the accounting device
that recognizes the gradual wearing out of machinery and other
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Or they stop the clock, as Walter P. Schuetze, chief accountant
of the SEC's enforcement division, noted in an acerbic speech last
December. He cited one company that had ``turned back its computer
clock that recorded and dated shipments so that out-of-period
shipments, and consequently revenue, would be recorded'' in the
just-ended quarter, fattening that quarter's profit.
</P>
<P>
   Such deeds do not just affect shareholders of the business. Some
well-known companies _ for example, Sunbeam, Sensormatic and Livent
Inc. _ have had to restate earnings in recent months, correcting
one or another accounting misstep. Such announcements have often
caused a company's stock to plunge, contributing to the market's
considerable volatility.
</P>
<P>
   There is a broader concern. The robust growth in corporate
profits in recent years has been billboard advertising for the
American market system, which has seemed more successful than the
less prosperous, and more regulated, European and Japanese models.
</P>
<P>
   Now the American billboard needs a warning label, one that using
Ciesielski's words might say: ``Earnings gaming is widespread.''

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Back in early February, an investing site on the
World Wide Web called Trading-places.net generated a flurry of
excitement among investors who followed the advice of its guru and
owner, Chris Rea. Known on the web as Merlin, Rea puts his picks
out to members, who then tend to pile into the stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Rea _ now under investigation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission for his site's relationship with a brokerage firm he has
recommended to customers _ definitely has pull. The shares he often
touts make impressive trading spikes. But when the buying stampede
slows, the stocks quickly drift down.
</P>
<P>
   Among the stocks Merlin touted the first week of February were
Bull &AMP; Bear Group, a mutual fund company; Imaginon, a money-losing
software concern, and three brokerage firms: J.B. Oxford Holdings,
Muriel Siebert &AMP; Co. and M.H. Meyerson &AMP; Co. They went up when he
waved his wand and dropped when he stopped.
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful that all the Merlin followers who piled into
these stocks were able to get out before they fell. But documents
now trickling in show that another cast of characters made big
money on the sudden popularity of these shares _ corporate
insiders.
</P>
<P>
   On the very day that Merlin was advising investors to plunge
into Bull &AMP; Bear Group, for example, five of its insiders were
selling stock. Insiders sold a total of 127,500 shares on Feb. 4 at
prices between $7.19 and $9.25, generating almost $1.1 million for
the sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a day's work _ especially considering that two
trading days later, the stock had fallen back to around $4. It
closed last week at $3.75.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders at M.H. Meyerson &AMP; Co. did even better. As investors
piled in from Feb. 3 to Feb. 5, the company's five top executives
were getting out. They sold 501,760 shares, generating $6.4
million. Martin H. Meyerson, the brokerage firm's chairman and
founder, sold 200,000 shares _ almost 8 percent of his holdings _
at prices between $8.99 and $15.88. He reaped almost $2.5 million.
M.H. Meyerson shares closed at $4 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And finally there were the insiders exiting Imaginon Inc., a
favorite that Merlin has touted more than once. On Feb. 5, as
Merlin was pushing the stock, an insider named Henry Fong sold $1.2
million in Imaginon shares at prices between $6 and $7.19 each. The
stock has since fallen to $4.875.
</P>
<P>
   None of the executives who sold their shares in February
returned phone calls Friday seeking comment. But Imaginon's
president, David Schwartz, who has complained publicly about the
manic price swings in his stock, said Fong told him that his sales
were for personal reasons and that their timing was coincidental to
the surge in the stock.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong, of course, with insiders taking profits
in a rising stock. But such sales may suggest that the people who
know a company best don't expect the shares to keep going up. Bob
Gabele, who tracks insider transactions for First Call in
Rockville, Md., put it simply: ``Investors who are rushing to buy
have to worry about who's heading for the door.''

   U.S. and allied forces tore deeper into the heart of the Serb
military machine Friday in a third day of air strikes across
Yugoslavia, as American warplanes shot down two Serb fighter jets
near a base of U.S. troops in neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, thousands of Serb troops backed with tanks
deepened their year-long campaign of terror, attacking villages and
ravaging homes amid unconfirmed reports of round-ups and summary
killings of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Across the region, anti-American violence swept as far away at
Greece, where an estimated 10,000 protesters marched on the U.S.
Embassy in Athens, hurling stones and bricks until they were
dispersed by riot police firing water cannons.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration found itself waging a
global campaign for public support for continuing the assault, even
as the Pentagon hunkered down for what could be a prolonged air war
on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin voiced outrage over the
escalating violence against ethnic Albanians, citing ''ominous''
reports of widening atrocities and warning that perpetrators would
be regarded as war criminals subject to trial and punishment once
the crisis ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are increasing reports of atrocities against Albanian
civilians in Kosovo,'' Rubin said. ``We are extremely alarmed by
these reports, and we are putting a great deal of resources and
effort into checking these out, as quickly as we can and as
thoroughly as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the reports the administration was looking into were
allegations by some refugees fleeing Kosovo that up to 20,000
ethnic Albanians had been put on a forced march by Serb troops.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Council spokesman David Leavy(CQ) said late
Friday that he could not confirm those reports, but he acknowledged
that they were among a raft of disturbing allegations emanating
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing on that,'' Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of reports of atrocities, that's exactly
why we're doing this,'' he said, referring to the NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Yugoslavia's Foreign Minister, Zivadin
Jovanovic, went on the CNN television network to decry the reports
of atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethnic Albanians (in the Serbian province of Kosovo) are
Yugoslav citizens,'' Jovanovic insisted. ``They enjoy equal rights,
equal opportunities, but terrorists have to be neutralized.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade claims that its military campaign in Kosovo has been
necessary to combat rebel groups of Kosovar Albanians pressing for
independence for the province of 2.2 million people, 90 percent of
whom are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin cited reports that Serb forces executed 20 ethnic
Albanians in the village of Goden on Thursday. The alleged killings
were reported by refugees from the region to the United Nations
High Commission on Refugees, which is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. officials would not confirm the killings, the
International Crisis Group, a private private humanitarian
organization in Washington, has monitored the situation. The
group's Balkans program coordinator Albert Cevallos reported the
following alleged atrocities:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On Friday, Albanian lawyer Bayram Keljmendi, who was
representing the Koha Ditore, one of the largest Albanian
newspapers, and his two sons allegedly were taken from their home
in the Kosovo provincial capital of Pristina, and executed by
Serbian troops. The three mens' bodies were reportedly seen about
one mile outside of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On Thursday, the warehouse for the Mother Theresa Society, one
of the largest local humanitarian organizations, was burned to the
ground near Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On Friday, the press agency for the separatist rebels, the
Kosovo Liberation Army, reported that 20 Albanians had been killed
in a mass execution in the town of Orahovac, and another 10 in the
town of Podujevo.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On Thursday, the warehouse for the Mother Theresa Society, one
of the largest local humanitarian organizations, was burned to the
ground near Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the starkest testimony to the terror has been the number
of ethnic Albanians -- 365,000 as of Friday -- who have fled their
homes, most with only those belongings they could carry, to escape
the onslaught of Serb troops and thugs.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the horror, NATO officials in Brussels reported Friday
that 300 hardened Serb criminals have been released in recent days
and added to the ranks of the rampaging patrols in Kosovo, a
reprise of a tactic Serbs unleashed to brutal effect in their 3
1/2-year war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said it would step up its satellite surveillance of
Kosovo by flying unmanned drone aircraft into the region to monitor
by low altitude camera what can no longer be witnessed firsthand in
a province where international monitors, journalists and aid
workers have been forced to flee.
</P>
<P>
   To date, NATO attacks have focused on Serb air defenses, early
warning radar sites, fuel and ammunition dumps, power stations and
command and control systems.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks began around 9 p.m. local time Friday in Yugoslavia,
with news reports of explosions in at least 11 suburbs ringing the
capital of Belgrade, where air sirens blared and a city-wide
blackout was imposed for a third straight night.
</P>
<P>
   While hitting at the headquarters and supply centers of the Serb
army, police and special forces believed responsible for the bulk
of the Kosovo oppression, the U.S. Air Force has refrained from
using its extensive capabilities for pursuing tanks and troops in
the fields and on the roads of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That could change in the days ahead, however, Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon told reporters in Washington, as the NATO strikes
continued to weaken Serb air defenses, reducing the dangers to NATO
pilots flying missions directly targeting Serb forces in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``As these strikes continue over the following days, we will, as
appropriate, increase the concentration and focus on targets within
Kosovo itself,'' said Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials insisted, however, that the Serbs' ongoing
attacks on civilians are an extension of the very Serb repression
that has prompted the NATO strikes and should not be regarded as
retaliation for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be somehow quite perverse to put the cart before the
horse and somehow conclude that it's NATO action which has given
President Milosevic a pretext to crack down,'' NATO spokesman Jamie
Shea told reporters at alliance headquarters in Brussels. ``He's
been cracking down without any pretext at all for the best part of
a year. We are intervening to stop that from happening, and to stop
it once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic is the president of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it vowed to ratchet up air attacks directly on the Serb
forces conducting the repression in Kosovo, though, the Pentagon
got a bone-rattling reminder of the perils of continued conflict in
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Yugoslav MiG-29 fighter jets managed to get within 25
miles of Tuzla, base for the 6,900 U.S. troops taking part in the
NATO peacekeeping operation in Bosnia, before being shot down by
two American F-15 fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb aircraft were spotted by a U.S. AWACS airplane flying
surveillance over the region, Bacon said. The AWACS alerted the
F-15 pilots, who were flying combat air patrols in the area and
quickly intercepted and destroyed the MiGs.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Friday, NATO patrols were searching for the Serb
pilots and the wreckage of the aircraft. Bacon said the MiGs'
mission remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts speculated, however, that Milosevic might have
hoped to slip past the NATO air defenses to stage a surprise attack
on the U.S. troops, stationed not far from where the MiGs were shot
down near the town of Teocak.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Mach 1, that's about 10 seconds from the Tuzla air base,''
said Balkans expert Bill Stuebner of the U.S. Institute for Peace,
a quasi-governmental think tank in Washington, D.C. ``Milosevic
must have decided to take a chance and send home body bags to the
United States to see how that would affect the dynamic here at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   His reference was to polls showing thin domestic support for
U.S.-led NATO strikes in Yugoslavia, a mission over which the
public is divided in a roughly even split.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to build public backing for his policy, President Clinton
planned to devote his Saturday radio address to the Kosovo crisis,
an issue he addressed the nation on when the air strikes began on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to reiterate his resolve to wage a long-term
air campaign against Serb military forces, unless Milosevic agrees
to an international peace plan for Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Like a growing number of young Asian
entrepreneurs, Nobuhiro Michishita saw a future for himself in
cyberspace but felt that he had to go to the United States to
pursue it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to develop a business model for the future, and
it is much easier to do it here than at home'' said Michishita, 38,
a computer scientist from Japan. ``Computer people in their 20s and
30s, they don't look to Japan but to Silicon Valley for ways to
work the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   In America, Michishita has become something he was unlikely to
be in Japan: a serial entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Operating out of the International Business Incubator, a joint
venture of San Jose State University and the San Jose city
government, he has given life to N&AMP;S Consulting, an Internet
consultancy that also has offices in Tokyo; Cyberspace Navigation,
which sells Japanese-made toys on the Web from a base in nearby Los
Altos, and other ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The incubator, a modest downtown high-rise, has become a magnet
for a dozen or so entrepreneurs from Asia who, like Michishita,
left home frustrated at the costs and obstacles in the way of new
ideas there.
</P>
<P>
   Michishita tried starting a business in Japan but lost patience
with delays and governmental paperwork. He hired an expediter to
help him navigate the bureaucracy, but his application for a
business license was rejected over technicalities.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in America. ``When I went to Los Altos City Hall to
incorporate, right away they gave me a paper and said,
`Congratulations and good luck,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, too, has business incubators meant to foster new
technology enterprises, but Michishita said the bureaucrats who run
them care more about edifices than entrepreneurs. ``An incubator in
Japan is basically a big building; they still are oriented around
the hardware,'' he said. ``There is no knowledge, no exchange of
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a decade ago, Japan and its East Asian neighbors were seen
as a technological juggernaut that would soon overtake the United
States, with powerful companies like Matsushita, Sony and Samsung
in the lead and young scientists like Michishita expected to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet has changed all that. Fleet-footed
entrepreneurs in America are now out in front while Asia's
corporate giants and the countries that bred them struggle to
adapt.
</P>
<P>
   Although use of the Internet is growing in Asia, the gap with
the United States remains wide. Japan, Asia's dominant economy, has
about 9.6 computers connected to the Internet for for every 1,000
people, half as many as in the United States, according to Jupiter
Communications, a consulting company that compiles Internet
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   In online commerce, Asia is even further behind, according to
the International Data Corp. In 2001, Asia is expected to account
for 17 percent of all Internet commerce, while the United States
will have more than 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Asian countries closed technological gaps by making
huge investments in research and development. But the Internet
poses a challenge not easily overcome with engineering and money,
according to Sung Kim, who came to San Jose from South Korea last
year to found Nextream, a software company.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we saw a technology from a U.S. company and
followed it,'' said Kim, 38, of his days at Samsung, his former
employer. ``Now it's not a matter so much of getting the
technology; it's the ideas about how to use it that matter. Take a
company like Yahoo. It's not really a technology, it's about an
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Nextream develops software to link mainframe computers to the
Internet and sells it mainly to Korean banks and other financial
institutions. But like Michishita, Kim said he had to leave a
stifling environment _ in his case, the world of South Korea's
giant conglomerates _ to embark on the venture.
</P>
<P>
   The top-down management style and emphasis on manufacturing at
Samsung led executives there to think of products as ideas
conceived by executives and then executed with precision by
engineers, Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   He and his fellow founders of Nextream's small Seoul-based
parent company, Cheong Ji, wanted instead to emulate the more
flexible and informal management style popular in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Mike Morishita, formerly with Nippon Telephone and Telegraph,
points to
</P>
<P>
   another problem: Many top Asian executives personally know
little about the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Andersen Consulting survey, only 13 percent of
Japanese top executives said they were ``comfortable'' or
``familiar'' with the Internet, compared with 46 percent of their
American counterparts. Nearly 3 in 10 Japanese executives said they
did not even have access to cyberspace, compared with just 1
percent of the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Morishita said, Nippon Telephone tends to treat the
Internet not as an opportunity but rather as a reason to increase
rates. In the United States, local calls to an Internet service
provider are typically free, but in Japan they are usually toll
calls, adding $100 a month to the phone bill of someone using the
Internet for an hour a day. High-speed lines for businesses also
cost much more in Japan than in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too expensive to do this business in Japan,'' said
Morishita, who now, at 32, has a successful computer consulting
business, MM Systems, in the Los Angeles suburb of Torrance. MM
Systems designs Web sites for a mix of Japanese companies including
Imperial Hotel, Nissin Foods and even Nippon Telephone, as well as
American companies like Earthlink Network, an Internet service
provider based in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest problem for Internet companies in Asia may be
the cultural adhesion that helped propel the region's economic
growth for three decades, according to Akira Tsurukame, a business
consultant in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan is a place where the ties between people are very strong
and people like to do business with people they know personally,''
he said. ``The Internet is about networking strangers to talk to
each other,'' which is a threat to the interlocking networks of
suppliers and distributors on which big Japanese companies depend.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be wrong to assume that Japan will stay that way
forever, he said. He and Michishita have started an organization
called Business Cafe to attract Japanese Internet entrepreneurs to
the San Jose incubator this year, with the goal of sending the new
cyberculture back to the home islands. Applications have come in
not just from young entrepreneurs but also from well-placed
executives at Mitsubishi Electric, Toshiba and Sony.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are feeling frustration with Japan now and
want to find a different way to make things work,'' Michishita
said. ``People see the value in coming to Silicon Valley.''

   U.S. and allied forces tore deeper into the heart of the Serb
military machine Friday in a third day of air strikes across
Yugoslavia, as American warplanes shot down two Serb fighter jets
near a base of U.S. troops in neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, thousands of Serb troops backed with tanks
deepened their year-long campaign of terror, attacking villages and
ravaging homes amid unconfirmed reports of round-ups and summary
killings of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Across the region, anti-American violence swept as far away at
Greece, where an estimated 10,000 protesters marched on the U.S.
Embassy in Athens, hurling stones and bricks until they were
dispersed by riot police firing water cannons.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration found itself waging a
global campaign for public support for continuing the assault, even
as the Pentagon hunkered down for what could be a prolonged air war
on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin voiced outrage over the
escalating violence against ethnic Albanians, citing ''ominous''
reports of widening atrocities and warning that perpetrators would
be regarded as war criminals subject to trial and punishment once
the crisis ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are increasing reports of atrocities against Albanian
civilians in Kosovo,'' Rubin said. ``We are extremely alarmed by
these reports, and we are putting a great deal of resources and
effort into checking these out, as quickly as we can and as
thoroughly as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the reports the administration was looking into were
allegations by some refugees fleeing Kosovo that up to 20,000
ethnic Albanians had been put on a forced march by Serb troops.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Council spokesman David Leavy(CQ) said late
Friday that he could not confirm those reports, but he acknowledged
that they were among a raft of disturbing allegations emanating
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing on that,'' Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of reports of atrocities, that's exactly
why we're doing this,'' he said, referring to the NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Yugoslavia's Foreign Minister, Zivadin
Jovanovic, went on the CNN television network to decry the reports
of atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethnic Albanians (in the Serbian province of Kosovo) are
Yugoslav citizens,'' Jovanovic insisted. ``They enjoy equal rights,
equal opportunities, but terrorists have to be neutralized.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade claims that its military campaign in Kosovo has been
necessary to combat rebel groups of Kosovar Albanians pressing for
independence for the province of 2.2 million people, 90 percent of
whom are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin cited reports that Serb forces executed 20 ethnic
Albanians in the village of Goden on Thursday. The alleged killings
were reported by refugees from the region to the United Nations
High Commission on Refugees, which is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. officials would not confirm the killings, the
International Crisis Group, a private private humanitarian
organization in Washington, has monitored the situation. The
group's Balkans program coordinator Albert Cevallos reported the
following alleged atrocities:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On Friday, Albanian lawyer Bayram Keljmendi, who was
representing the Koha Ditore, one of the largest Albanian
newspapers, and his two sons allegedly were taken from their home
in the Kosovo provincial capital of Pristina, and executed by
Serbian troops. The three mens' bodies were reportedly seen about
one mile outside of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On Thursday, the warehouse for the Mother Theresa Society, one
of the largest local humanitarian organizations, was burned to the
ground near Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On Friday, the press agency for the separatist rebels, the
Kosovo Liberation Army, reported that 20 Albanians had been killed
in a mass execution in the town of Orahovac, and another 10 in the
town of Podujevo.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On Thursday, the warehouse for the Mother Theresa Society, one
of the largest local humanitarian organizations, was burned to the
ground near Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the starkest testimony to the terror has been the number
of ethnic Albanians -- 365,000 as of Friday -- who have fled their
homes, most with only those belongings they could carry, to escape
the onslaught of Serb troops and thugs.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the horror, NATO officials in Brussels reported Friday
that 300 hardened Serb criminals have been released in recent days
and added to the ranks of the rampaging patrols in Kosovo, a
reprise of a tactic Serbs unleashed to brutal effect in their 3
1/2-year war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said it would step up its satellite surveillance of
Kosovo by flying unmanned drone aircraft into the region to monitor
by low altitude camera what can no longer be witnessed firsthand in
a province where international monitors, journalists and aid
workers have been forced to flee.
</P>
<P>
   To date, NATO attacks have focused on Serb air defenses, early
warning radar sites, fuel and ammunition dumps, power stations and
command and control systems.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks began around 9 p.m. local time Friday in Yugoslavia,
with news reports of explosions in at least 11 suburbs ringing the
capital of Belgrade, where air sirens blared and a city-wide
blackout was imposed for a third straight night.
</P>
<P>
   While hitting at the headquarters and supply centers of the Serb
army, police and special forces believed responsible for the bulk
of the Kosovo oppression, the U.S. Air Force has refrained from
using its extensive capabilities for pursuing tanks and troops in
the fields and on the roads of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That could change in the days ahead, however, Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon told reporters in Washington, as the NATO strikes
continued to weaken Serb air defenses, reducing the dangers to NATO
pilots flying missions directly targeting Serb forces in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``As these strikes continue over the following days, we will, as
appropriate, increase the concentration and focus on targets within
Kosovo itself,'' said Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials insisted, however, that the Serbs' ongoing
attacks on civilians are an extension of the very Serb repression
that has prompted the NATO strikes and should not be regarded as
retaliation for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be somehow quite perverse to put the cart before the
horse and somehow conclude that it's NATO action which has given
President Milosevic a pretext to crack down,'' NATO spokesman Jamie
Shea told reporters at alliance headquarters in Brussels. ``He's
been cracking down without any pretext at all for the best part of
a year. We are intervening to stop that from happening, and to stop
it once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic is the president of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it vowed to ratchet up air attacks directly on the Serb
forces conducting the repression in Kosovo, though, the Pentagon
got a bone-rattling reminder of the perils of continued conflict in
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Yugoslav MiG-29 fighter jets managed to get within 25
miles of Tuzla, base for the 6,900 U.S. troops taking part in the
NATO peacekeeping operation in Bosnia, before being shot down by
two American F-15 fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb aircraft were spotted by a U.S. AWACS airplane flying
surveillance over the region, Bacon said. The AWACS alerted the
F-15 pilots, who were flying combat air patrols in the area and
quickly intercepted and destroyed the MiGs.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Friday, NATO patrols were searching for the Serb
pilots and the wreckage of the aircraft. Bacon said the MiGs'
mission remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts speculated, however, that Milosevic might have
hoped to slip past the NATO air defenses to stage a surprise attack
on the U.S. troops, stationed not far from where the MiGs were shot
down near the town of Teocak.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Mach 1, that's about 10 seconds from the Tuzla air base,''
said Balkans expert Bill Stuebner of the U.S. Institute for Peace,
a quasi-governmental think tank in Washington, D.C. ``Milosevic
must have decided to take a chance and send home body bags to the
United States to see how that would affect the dynamic here at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   His reference was to polls showing thin domestic support for
U.S.-led NATO strikes in Yugoslavia, a mission over which the
public is divided in a roughly even split.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to build public backing for his policy, President Clinton
planned to devote his Saturday radio address to the Kosovo crisis,
an issue he addressed the nation on when the air strikes began on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to reiterate his resolve to wage a long-term
air campaign against Serb military forces, unless Milosevic agrees
to an international peace plan for Kosovo.

 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ American entrepreneurs have been buying tens of
thousands of vehicles cheaply at Canadian dealerships and reselling
them in the United States, making substantial profits and in the
process sidestepping U.S. fuel-economy rules.
</P>
<P>
   This cross-border commerce is booming because cars and trucks,
including those made in the United States, cost less in Canada
these days _ as much as $5,000 less for big sport utility vehicles
and large cars. The Canadian dollar's value has tumbled, dropping
nearly 9 percent against the U.S. dollar the last two years.
Automakers have been reluctant to raise Canadian prices to
compensate because the Canadian economy is weaker and incomes are
lower than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Imports of new and used vehicles from Canada have risen nearly
12-fold the last two years because of the price gap and are still
rising. Roughly 10,000 vehicles a month are entering the country
under a special program originally designed mainly to help
immigrants from Canada bring their cars here. Factories in the
United States are shipping thousands of vehicles to Canadian
dealers who put them on trucks back to the United States for resale
as new cars by dealers here.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian prices tend to be particularly low for large models,
notably full-size sport utility vehicles. Canadian taxes keep
gasoline prices about 20 percent higher than in the United States,
limiting demand for big gas guzzlers. Most of the vehicles being
brought south are large and built in the United States but are
exempt from federal rules aimed at improving the fuel economy of
the nation's fleet of family vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Average Americans cannot simply go to Canada, buy a cheap
vehicle and drive it back, because they would face weeks or months
of paperwork before crossing the border. The Transportation
Department issues licenses to businesses, known as registered
importers, to bring in vehicles and companies are lining up for
these licenses; the number of registered importers has risen to 144
from 80 the last 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   Of 74,413 vehicles brought into the United States last year, all
but 400 or so came from Canada. The reason is simple: cars and
trucks imported from anywhere else, including Mexico, require
thousands of dollars in modifications to meet U.S. safety and
environmental rules.
</P>
<P>
   But Canada has followed U.S. safety standards for years and
adopted U.S. vehicular pollution rules as of Sept. 1, 1997.
Registered importers usually just replace the Canadian speedometer
and odometer, which are calibrated in kilometers instead of miles.
</P>
<P>
   Most registered importers serve as middlemen between Canadian
and American dealers and do not have the staff to sell vehicles to
the general public. It is up to the American dealer whether to pass
on the savings to customers.
</P>
<P>
   The registered importers contend that they are helping consumers
by providing American car dealers with a way around the steep
markups that automakers now charge in the United States,
particularly on large vehicles. ``All we do is relocate vehicles to
someone who can help them,'' said Richard Izzo, the president of
Superior Auto Sales Inc., a registered importer in Hamburg, N.Y.,
near Buffalo, which ships cars as far south as Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Palczewski, a milk processing company executive in Orchard
Park, N.Y., and his daughter, Tracey, bought a new, Mexican-made
silver Volkswagen New Beetle from Canada for her in early January
rather than go on a four-month waiting list for a Beetle imported
directly from Mexico. ``It has been great,'' Palczewski said.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers and individuals have been trading cars across borders in
Europe for years to take advantage of currency shifts, and national
differences in car prices have become a big consumer issue there.
Here and in Europe, some automakers have tried to discourage the
trade.
</P>
<P>
   The registered importers are exempt from U.S. fuel-economy
regulations, which require that the average fuel economy for all of
the cars sold by each automaker must be at least 27.5 miles a
gallon. The average fuel economy for each automaker's sales of
sport utility vehicles, vans and pickup trucks must be at least
20.7 miles a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   A computer printout supplied by the Transportation Department of
virtually all the vehicles brought in last year shows that there
were very few small cars and fairly few small sport utilities,
pickups or minivans; the list is dominated by large, heavy vehicles
with poor fuel economy.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have not calculated the average fuel economy of
vehicles being brought in by the registered importers because no
law requires them to do so. By contrast, direct imports from
automakers' overseas factories total about two million vehicles
each year, and these are subject to fuel economy laws.
</P>
<P>
   Monthly shipments of registered imports are currently equal to a
little less than 1 percent of all vehicles sold in the United
States, too small a number to have a significant impact on the fuel
economy of any manufacturer. Still, even at the margin, from a
regulatory standpoint, the shipments are helpful to the automakers,
which are under severe pressure to meet the fuel-economy targets.
General Motors has been taking particularly drastic measures, like
cutting short the 1998 model year of the giant Chevrolet Suburban
after just five months of production to keep GM's corporate average
up.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Executives from GM, Ford Motor, DaimlerChrysler and several
foreign automakers say they absolutely do not have a policy of
avoiding fuel-economy rules by shipping big vehicles to Canada and
then letting them trickle back into the United States. Indeed, the
automakers have financial incentives to limit the cross-border
trade and are taking some steps to do so. Their profit margins are
smaller on the vehicles they sell at lower markups to Canadian
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   James Holden, DaimlerChrysler's executive vice president for
North American sales, pointed out that executives who deliberately
tried to subvert the Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules could
face criminal prosecution. ``We don't play games on CAFE, and I
don't believe that any other manufacturer would play that game,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   GM president Richard Wagoner said automakers preferred to sell
cars and trucks for higher prices in the United States. ``If
anything, the Canadians have to squeal to get their fair share,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's computers have been programmed to spot cases is which
Ford cars originally shipped to Canadian dealers were taken in for
warranty work at Ford's dealers in the United States. While Ford
pays for the warranty work, it also traces the serial number to
determine if the vehicle was sold across the border soon after it
was shipped to Canada. If it was, Ford identifies the Canadian
dealer who originally received the vehicle from the factory and
charges that dealer a fee equal to the dealer's estimated profit on
the vehicle's sale.
</P>
<P>
   Ford sells an Expedition XLT full-size sport utility vehicle
with four-wheel drive for $32,730 retail in the United States.
North of the border, Ford charges the Canadian equivalent of
$27,550.
</P>
<P>
   Some automakers, like Volkswagen, put no limits on the
cross-border shipments.
</P>
<P>
   Only one automaker, Honda Motor, has really crimped the
registered importers by limiting the availability of replacement
speedometers and odometers in recent months. Art Garner, a Honda
spokesman, said the automaker wanted to make sure dealers told
customers when they were buying a vehicle meant for the Canadian
market, which is difficult to determine once the speedometer and
odometer have been changed.
</P>
<P>
   Honda, one of the few automakers that does not have a problem
meeting the average fuel-economy rules, also has an unusually
stringent warranty policy. American Honda dealers who sell cars
purchased from Canadian dealers are required to pay for any
warranty work done on the cars anywhere in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Registered importers are furious at Honda, contending that it is
limiting American dealers' freedom to acquire vehicles at the
lowest possible cost. But the policy appears to have been
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Honda started enforcing the speedometer policy with its Odyssey
minivans, for which there are long waiting lists at its American
dealerships; only eight Odysseys were brought in from Canada by
registered importers last year, according to the Transportation
Department.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As NATO forces stepped up their missile assault
into the daylight hours, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia
maintained fierce resistance Friday both on the ground and in the
air. Two of his MiG-29 fighters were shot down on what NATO claimed
was a foray into neighboring Bosnia. The status of the pilots was
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The sweep by Serb troops through the ethnic Albanian villages of
Kosovo continued unabated, NATO said, despite the third straight
day of air assaults that NATO officials claimed were succeeding and
would remain unrelenting until Milosevic accepted peace.
</P>
<P>
   Unconfirmed reports of violence against civilians continued as
refugees from the ethnic Albanian majority of Kosovo, Serbia's
southernmost province, straggled across the border with Macedonia
with tales of increasing anarchy. There were also dramatic but
unconfirmed reports of thousands of Kosovo refugees being pushed
along a road with Serbian tanks at their back.
</P>
<P>
   In the airstrikes, a series of explosions rocked the outskirts
of Belgrade Friday night, with NATO officials saying the target
list was being broadened specifically to include bunker positions
of the Yugoslav military hierarchy in the Belgrade area as well as
army and police outposts in Kosovo. NATO officials said even more
severe assaults would follow.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton sought to appeal directly to the Serbian
people in a televised statement, beamed by satellite throughout the
region, in which he denounced Milosevic. ``He has diminished your
country's standing, exposed you to violence and instability, and
isolated you from the rest of Europe,'' Clinton declared in a
broadcast translated into Serbo-Croat. ``Right now he's forcing
your sons to keep fighting a senseless conflict that you did not
ask for and that he could have prevented.'' It was unclear how
widely the broadcast was viewed.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, the government has claimed ``minimal damage'' from
the NATO attacks in reporting at least a dozen people killed and
scores wounded. But Milosevic's U.N. representative, Vladislav
Jovanovic, claimed ``hundreds of civilians'' had been killed in the
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   The downing of the two MiGs inside Bosnia by two U.S. F-15C
fighters raised the question of whether Yugoslavia was attempting
to extend the conflict and involve neighboring nations.
Administration officials said the planes were shot down from a
four-plane group that violated Bosnian air space. They crossed the
western border of Serbia and were presumed to be heading
aggressively toward NATO peace-keeping ground troops in Bosnia. The
American interceptors were not from the NATO assault force but
rather part of the Bosnia peace-keeping patrols.
</P>
<P>
   The two losses, combined with earlier hits, means that by the
Pentagon's count Milosevic has already lost a third of his premier
air armada of 15 MiG-29s, highly rated Soviet fighter planes
designed for both air-to-air and air-to-ground combat. In a
subsequent incident, two MiG-21s crossed over Bosnia but retreated
before they could be intercepted, NATO said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an act of desperation,'' State Department spokesman
James Rubin said of the MiGs' incursion, characterizing it as
evidence of Milosevic's frustration at the NATO assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the Clinton administration issued a warning
to Milosevic that any evidence of atrocities in Kosovo would be
presented to war-crime investigators of the International Tribunal.
The tribunal has opened an investigation focusing on Milosevic's
role in the atrocity-ridden Balkan wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is extremely alarmed by reports of an
escalating pattern of Serbian attacks on Kosovar Albanian
civilians,'' Rubin said. ``We are using our national technical
means to observe events in Kosovo and are prepared to share that
information,'' he added, referring to satellite and aircraft
surveillance photo records that could eventually be consulted in
investigating specific allegations of atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   One NATO official said intelligence agents as well were on the
ground in Kosovo, trying to track Milosevic's troops as they routed
and attacked ethnic Albanian villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of even more concern,'' said NATO's Supreme Commander Gen.
Wesley Clark, ``Are the so-called paramilitary forces, including
gangs of hardened criminals which have in the past and are
apparently now being employed in ethnic cleansing operations
against the Kosovar Albanian population.''

</P>
<P>
   The State Department said the growing violence was exemplified
by such refugee reports _ not yet confirmed independently _ that
Serb forces executed 20 ethnic Albanians in the village of Goden
and were systematically targeting male civilians of fighting age.
</P>
<P>
   The third day of NATO's attack included the first daylight
strike, although the brunt of the assault came at night as sirens
once more braced the population of Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital.
In mid-afternoon, an American cruiser, the USS Philippine Sea,
fired two cruise missiles from the Adriatic. The missiles struck
what officials described as ``a target of opportunity'' _ military
aircraft spotted at an air base _ that had presented itself but was
not part of the day's plan. Explosions rocked the southwestern edge
of Belgrade shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   As dark fell over Yugoslavia, the main thrust of the attack
began. Air-launched cruise missiles fired from B-52s based in
England struck, followed by waves of fighters based in Italy,
including F-117 ``stealth'' fighters.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, Kosovo has been a sacred province in Serb
nationalist history, but 10 years ago, after Serbs slipped into the
minority and ethnic Albanians became the overwhelming majority,
Milosevic stripped the Kosovars of their autonomy. Last year, he
opened an aggressive military campaign against them as they sought
to regain self-rule. After agreeing under international pressure to
a peace plan last fall, the authoritarian Serb leader resumed his
ethnic cleansing attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The reports of atrocities put more pressure on NATO to broaden
its raids beyond air-defense and communications installations and
focus on the Yugoslav forces than have been attacking the ethnic
Albanians. Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said American and NATO
forces were ``gradually focusing'' their strikes on army and police
units in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Clark said the strikes were
methodically following a plan that emphasized air defenses, but
also included strikes at the army and police headquarters. NATO
released a list showing damage to army headquarters or barracks in
Danilovgrad in Montenegro, Kursumilja in Serbia and Urosevac,
Prizen and Pristina in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right on track with the plan,'' Clark said in the
interview. ``We're already attacking these headquarters, attacking
command centers.'' He said it was ``entirely predictable'' that the
Serbian campaign against villages would intensify with the NATO
assault.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Pleurat Sejeu, a spokesman for the Kosovo Liberation
Army, claimed that Serb forces were using warplanes against
villagers and had rounded up thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees
in the central Drenica region for a forced march toward the Kosovo
capital, Pristina. With human rights and foreign news workers
severely restricted in Serbia, there was no independent
confirmation of his claim.
</P>
<P>
   One senior NATO official conceded frustration at the Serb
paramilitary units accused of carrying out atrocities. ``We cannot
from the air do anything about these people,'' he said. ``But they
are protected by the Yugoslav armed forces and we can do something
about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the NATO assault claimed a diplomatic victory at
the United Nations when the Security Council rejected, 12-3, a
Russian resolution that the airstrikes be ended. China and Namibia
voted with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said that NATO officials
should be tried as war criminals. ``Those who have unleashed the
aggression against Yugoslavia must be prosecuted under criminal
law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Russia said it would send humanitarian aid to
Yugoslavia and no longer cooperate with the United States on the
Y2K problem. The cooperation primarily consists of Western advice
to the Russians on how to fix their computers and related missile
problems for the millennium. To punctuate the official anger, the
chief of Russia's military, Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, refused to pick
up the phone when he received a call from Gen. Henry Shelton, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   In Kiev, Ukrainian officials announced a Yugoslav peace
initiative. But American diplomats said it was a unilateral move
motivated by domestic political factors that is unlikely to come to
much.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgrade government has denounced the NATO raid as
``neo-Nazism,'' with Milosevic calling it an intrusion into an
internal civil war and a pretext to subvert the liberty of
Yugoslavia. In Belgrade, the government has claimed ``minimal
damage'' from the NATO attacks in reporting at least a dozen people
killed and scores wounded. But Milosevic's U.N. ambassador,
Vladislav Jovanovic, claimed ``hundreds of civilians'' had been
killed in the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb campaign against the ethnic Albanians has seen more
than 2,000 killed in the last year, with hundreds of thousands of
Kosovars driven from their homes, according to U.N. refugee
officials.
</P>
<P>
   In the administration's attempt to subvert Milosevic by
appealing directly to the Serbian people, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright also taped a broadcast, speaking in the
Serbo-Croatian language that she learned as a child when her father
was a diplomat in Belgrade. ``Americans do not hate Serbs,'' she
said. ``Like me, they remember that we were allies against
facism.''

SOME RUSSIANS SIGN UP TO AID SERBS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Vladimir Lokotsky likes American blue jeans, American
cigarettes, and American rock music. But Friday, he strode into the
makeshift recruiting center in central Moscow to sign up to fight
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Before NATO began bombing Serb forces in Yugoslavia, Lokotsky,
an unemployed sailor, had no reason to like, or even think much
about Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Now, Lokotsky says, he
is ready to die for him.
</P>
<P>
   Lokotsky is one of hundreds of young Russians who, encouraged by
communist and nationalist Russian politicians, have volunteered to
fight against NATO on the side of the Serbs. To hear these recruits
tell it, the American-led alliance's airstrikes pose a clear and
present threat to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stop the advance of NATO now,'' Lokotsky said as
patriotic music blared from a loudspeaker and young men in fatigues
carried stacks of new uniforms and boots past a poster that read,
``The Motherland is calling you!'' ``It's only thanks to the
Yugoslavs and Milosevic that NATO has not occupied Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia, mostly made up of Orthodox Christian Slavs like the
Serbs, has struck an increasingly hawkish pose as NATO's airstrikes
against Yugoslavia intensify.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Russia expelled NATO's Moscow representatives and
refused all contacts with alliance officials. Moscow called for a
world tribunal to charge the NATO leaders who planned the bombing.
And in an apparent display of military might, the Russian Navy sent
two of its most powerful warships to sea.
</P>
<P>
   The saber-rattling and rhetoric has been largely for show.
Russia, which will renew talks Sunday for a $4.8 billion loan from
the West with the International Monetary Fund, cannot afford to
match its aggressive words with action.
</P>
<P>
   The same cannot be said of ordinary Russians, angered that NATO
launched the airstrikes in defiance of Russia. Many people who a
week ago might have had little sympathy for Milosevic have reacted
to the bombing against Yugoslavia as if the airstrikes were aimed
at Russia. For the second day, crowds of young men, looking for an
outlet to vent their anger, have pelted the embassies of the United
States and other NATO countries with eggs and bottles. Hardline
politicians, sensing an opportunity to play on those emotions, have
set up the recruiting centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an Orthodox, a Slav,'' said Igor Gnusov, a professional
driver who had just signed up at a recruiting center run by Russian
ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky. ``I am doing this out
of patriotism. We have to defend Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhirinovsky's aides say they have collected more than 200
signatures in Moscow and 5,000 across Russia. While that claim is
impossible to verify, a steady stream of recruits marched into the
Moscow office, some of them veterans of the wars in Afghanistan or
Chechnya. Russia's Communists and several other anti-Western
parties have also started similar sign-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those questioned knew that Russia has fought alongside
Serbia over the past 150 years. Their common enemies, until now:
Ottoman Turkey, imperial Austria, and Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I am young, I love America. I love rock group Kiss,''
said Dima, a 30-year-old volunteer whose blue jeans and long hair
made him look a bit like Kiss guitarist Ace Frehley, without the
makeup. ``But when I turn 30, I change my mind. America force its
ideals on us. I'm tired of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Weary as he may be, Dima may never get to fight. For that to
happen, first the volunteers have to get permission to go to
Yugoslavia. Then there has to be something for them to do. Right
now, said Eduard Yanglayev, an aide to Zhirinovsky, the center is
looking for experienced pilots or anti-aircraft specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Critics dismissed the recruitment drive as an effort to derive
political capital by Zhirinovsky, the once-immensely popular
legislator whose national standing had fallen in polls to under the
5 percent needed by his party to win seats in parliament. Russian
leaders, meanwhile, considered ways to help Yugoslavia without
resorting to force or jeopardizing their chances for financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   A diplomatic effort was foiled Friday when the UN Security
Council overwhelmingly defeated a Russian resolution demanding an
immediate halt to the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Anatoly Kvashnin, head of the Russian General Staff,
declined to take a phone call from his American counterpart,
General Henry Shelton. Kvashnin said there was ``nothing to
discuss,'' Russian news agencies reported.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most powerful vessels in the Russian navy, the
nuclear-powered cruisers Admiral Kuznetsov and Petr Velikhy, sailed
from the Arctic port of Murmansk for what NTV television, quoting
Defense Ministry sources, called ``exercises.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this looks like a show of force,'' NTV anchorman
Mikhail Osokhin commented.
</P>
<P>
   Many politicians want to send Yugoslavia advance anti-aircraft
systems, but the Interfax news agency quoted a military expert as
saying it would be ``difficult'' to get shipments to the Serbs
through international blockades.
</P>
<P>
   Interfax quoted another source on the general staff as saying
Russia could provide Yugoslavia with Moscow's satellite
intelligence on NATO aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's parliament, which will hold an emergency session
Saturday to discuss responses to the NATO bombing, has already
decided to once again postpone ratifying the 1993 Start-II treaty
nuclear arms reduction. Legislators said they would propose
removing a Russian peacekeeping brigade in Bosnia from under the
command of a larger NATO peacekeeping force there.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the political forces,'' said centrist leader Vladimir
Ryzhkov, ``have consolidated'' on this issue.

YUGOSLAV JETS DOWNED AS SERBS CONTINUE ASSAULTS IN KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND LOUISE D. PALMER AND  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO planes Friday downed two Serb jets that made a
surprise incursion over Bosnia during an intensified third day of
bombardment that lasted through the night, while Yugoslavian forces
reportedly unleashed a new round of assaults on ethnic Albanian
civilians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The activity on both sides drew reaction from around the world
amid hints of the conflict's potential to widen. At least two NATO
nations stepped up their protests against the bombing, while US and
other Western officials insisted the airstrikes were crucial in
ending the Serbs' ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Albanians. Expressing
alarm over reports of new killings, President Clinton repeated his
conviction that ``only swift action can save peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But for a third day in a row, Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic showed no signs of capitulation. Indeed, despite NATO
reports of vast damage to the country's military infrastructure,
Serb jets went on the offensive, swooping down over Bosnia in a
possible attempt to fire on NATO peacekeeping forces stationed
there. US planes shot down two of the three intruding MiG-29s, but
officials interpreted the move as a sign that the fighting was not
about to end.
</P>
<P>
   The heightened skirmishing came as Clinton invoked the War
Powers Act, notifying Congress that troops were engaged in active
duty abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees poured across
the borders of Kosovo into Macedonia and Albania, according to
eyewitness reports, as violent protests against the bombings
continued to sweep the region. Civilian demonstrations in Bulgaria,
Macedonia, Athens, Toronto, and other cities were accompanied by
official objections in Greece, Italy, and Russia, where various
leaders said the bombings should stop.
</P>
<P>
   Russia issued the most vehement disapproval. Expelling NATO
officials from the country, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
said those who ordered the bombings were war criminals, and
demanded they stand trial. Russia also demanded that the United
Nations Security Council vote to halt the attacks. But in the
15-member council, only China and Namibia agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In Greece _ where 15,000 protesters chanted ``Clinton, fascist,
murderer'' during a march to the US Embassy _ officials also called
for an end to the attacks. In Italy, Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema
pleaded for the bombings to be as brief as possible, though he
conceded they were both ``necessary and inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright refused to acknowlege a
crack in NATO unity. Instead, in a message delivered in
Serbo-Croatian and beamed inside Yugoslavia, Albright urged
civilians to understand NATO's goals. She said she did not believe
the Serbs had been properly informed of the Rambouillet agreement
designed to end a year of ethnic strife in the Serbian province of
Kosovo. The Kosovar Albanians ultimately accepted the plan, but
Milosevic refused to sign, triggering the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tragically, Serb leaders rejected the agreement, renewed the
campaign of terror in Kosovo, and forced NATO to do what no one in
the alliance wanted to _ which is to begin airstrikes,'' Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton issued a similar message in the broadcast, saying, ``The
United States and our European allies have no quarrel with the
Serbian people.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said, ``The mission of the airstrikes is to demonstrate
the seriousness of NATO's purpose so that the Serbian leaders
understand the imperative of reversing course.''
</P>
<P>
   On the military front, Friday's offensive began at 8:20 a.m.
Eastern Standard Time with one Tomahawk missile, marking the first
daylight attack since airstrikes began Wednesday. The skirmish over
Bosnia took place at 11:35 a.m., when three MiG-29 planes were
picked up on radar by US Airborne Warning and Control System, or
AWACS, planes nearby, according to Defense Department spokesman
Kenneth H. Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   American F-15C fighter pilots shot down two of the Serb planes.
But despite earlier reports that the pilots of the two downed
MiG-29 jets had been taken into custody, Bacon said NATO officials
did not know their whereabouts. Nor, he said, could they be certain
of their motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, one reason could be to attack'' peacekeeping
``forces in Bosnia,'' he said. ``A second possibility is that they
were involved in some sort of a Serb scheme to shoot down one of
our planes . . . Obviously, if this was the scheme, it backfired
egregiously on the Yugoslavs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the intrusion constituted an ``attack'' and an
``escalation'' of the conflict. He also signaled a shift in
military priorities. In an attack the day before, officials said 20
percent of the targets were directly related to the Serb killing of
ethnic Albanians. By Friday, Bacon said Serb troops constituted 40
percent of the targets, meaning that enough infrastructure had been
damaged to allow pilots to turn their attention elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   After the midair battle, Bosnia's ambassador to the United
Nations, Muhamed Sacirbey, issued a protest, accusing the Serb
military of having ``crossed into the sovereign airspace of Bosnia
and Herzegovina with the intention of committing military strikes
against our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacirbey interpreted the intrusion into the Bosnian no-fly zone
_ where some 30,000 NATO peacekeeping troops have been stationed
since 1995 _ as an apparent ``attempt to broaden the war and
undermine the peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina.'' He quickly
requested an emergency Security Council meeting, saying it was
necessary to ``address this aggression into my country.''
</P>
<P>
   But rather than focus on the possibility that fighting was on
the verge of expanding throughout the region, attention in the
United States remained on the brutalities in the villages of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Serb police, along with other masked men, reportedly burned
villages and massacred civilians throughout western Kosovo, sending
the survivors fleeing for the borders. While NATO planes launched a
fresh wave of attacks Friday &UR;  &LR; night, sending missile-equipped B-52
bombers and F-117 stealth fighter jets with laser-guided munitions
back over Kosovo, the State Department issued a reaction to the
killings. Spokesman James Rubin said officials there were
``extremely alarmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry also expressed ``serious concern if there
is an escalation of the very thing we are trying to prevent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more concerned about what's happening on the ground in
Kosovo than whatever minimal resistance is being met in the air,''
Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, warned: ``Let's not
go wobbly here, as Margaret Thatcher used to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in it,'' McCain said in an interview. ``This is not
going to be a day at the beach.''

SERB MILITARY TAKES ADVANTAGE OF UNPREDICTABILITY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What began as a swift NATO bomb-dropping raid
appeared Friday to be evolving into a far more complicated game of
cat-and-mouse in the Yugoslavian skies, as the Serbian Air Force
continued to play to its greatest asset: unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts did not expect the Serbs to send more than
half of their best jets into the skies, only to be decimated by
NATO forces within the first 48 hours. On the other hand, officials
did assume Serbs would have by now launched their powerful
surface-to-air missiles, which so far have remained almost entirely
out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   And yet that is exactly the peculiar air war that has played
out, forcing analysts and officials to concentrate their
assessments of the situation, and alter their predictions of what
will come next.
</P>
<P>
   One treacherous possibility, according to experts and US defense
officials: Yugoslav forces are purposely hoarding their air-defense
missile systems, which could be wiped out by high-altitude planes
overhead if pilots spotted them being fired.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some analysts believe the Serbs are ratcheting
up their brutal assaults on Albanians in part to outrage NATO
forces. Because NATO has vowed not to send in ground troops, their
best remaining tool to fight the atrocities on the ground would be
low-flying planes such as the A-10 fighter _ known as the ``flying
bathtub'' for its durability _ which are designed to hit targets
such as tanks, but are also highly vulnerable to anti-aircraft
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs, according to defense analyst John Pike, may have stumbled
upon a strategy ``that would provoke NATO aircraft, that they could
then shoot down with all the SA-6s that they have been holding in
reserve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly the dilemma that is present today,'' said Pike
of the Federation of American Scientists. ``NATO is very far from
suppressing Serbian air defenses. But there's a reluctance to stand
by and see the Serbs kill more people this weekend than they've
killed in the last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said the renewed
killings were a ``major concern'' and may be the reason ``we are
hearing some murmurs about the fact that we have not sent in our
A-10 aircraft to take out some of the Serbian tanks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is driven by the fear of the surface-to-air missile
threat,'' McCain said. ``The reason we got in was to stop that
ethnic cleansing. We've got to keep our nerve.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Serbs are now at a greater disadvantage in the
air war, having lost half of their best planes in the last two
days.
</P>
<P>
   According to military analysts and officials, the Yugoslav
military started out in possession of some 12 or 15 MiG-29 fighter
jets, which are Soviet-made planes on par with jets used by the
United States and NATO. They have since lost five of those jets and
are left with a mostly outdated fleet of MiG-21s, as well as
several dozen smaller homemade planes and helicopters _ planes that
could still drop lightweight bombs, for example, on troops in
Bosnia, but would stand little chance of survival against an
American F-15.

RADIOACTIVE GARBAGE WELCOMED IN NEW MEXICO
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, N.M. _ A flatbed truck carrying six drums of
radioactive garbage rumbled through this remote mining city before
dawn Friday, heralding the long-delayed opening of the world's
first permanent nuclear waste dump.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the first shipment to the Waste Isolation Pilot
Plant set off a celebration among Carlsbad residents eager to make
a 240,000-year commitment. That is how long, give or take a few
millennia, until the plutonium on clothes, tools, sludge, and other
trash being buried in an ancient salt bed will deteriorate enough
to be almost free of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Protests and legal challenges, almost exclusively by out-of-town
groups, had postponed the opening of the $1.8 billion, federal
government-owned facility _ generally known by its acronym, WIPP _
since its 1988 completion. But with opponents' last-minute appeals
exhausted, the plant was declared open, thrilling local leaders and
most of Carlsbad's 25,000 residents, who see economic salvation and
hundreds of jobs in the carcinogenic import.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word nuclear scares the pants off people, and the word
waste doesn't enhance it any. But we think it's safe,'' said Tracy
Hill, executive director of the Carlsbad Chamber of Commerce. ``We
see this as a solution to a national challenge, and there's
opportunity in it for us, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, opponents continued to voice fears about using public
highways to transport radioactive byproducts of the US military and
research nuclear programs. They also doubt the reliability of the
plant, which will entomb the drums a half-mile below the cactus and
tumbleweeds that dot the region.
</P>
<P>
   As the specially designed truck bearing the wastes made its way
along a 356-mile route from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, it
was met with a mix of cheers by supporters and jeers by about 70
drum-beating, sign-carrying protesters. One man was arrested for
trying to block the truck's path with his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``WIPP is in the wrong place,'' said Betty Richards, who owns a
mobile home park in Carlsbad and is one of only three local
opponents. ``They say the salt beds are so stable because they're
so old, but they destabilized them by drilling into them. There are
cracks and fissures there that we believe will bring waste to the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really sad because the people here are going to be the
next generation of guinea pigs by the Department of Energy,''
Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   Though most trash will come from materials used in the
production of nuclear bomb and other defense-related activities,
Friday's shipment consisted of six 55-gallon drums of trash _ each
weighing up to 1,000 pounds _ generated while building deep-space
NASA probes.
</P>
<P>
   The drums made the trip inside three 10-feet-high,
thermos-shaped containers built to prevent the release of
radiation, even in an accident or emergency. Federal officials
anticipate more than 37,000 such shipments, consisting of 850,000
barrels of nuclear waste, will make their way to WIPP in the next
35 years.
</P>
<P>
   The truck's arrival just before 4 a.m. set off cheers from about
400 people who gathered at the heavily guarded facility, built on
an isolated site 26 miles from downtown Carlsbad. A blast from the
truck's horn was greeted by flag-waving, noisemakers, hugs,
back-slaps, and the burst of camera flashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've waited so long for this. I can't believe it finally made
it,'' said Pat Kilgore, a WIPP employee.
</P>
<P>
   A cordoned-off area for protesters was empty except for a dozen
WIPP supporters who were unable to gain credentials to enter the
gated compound.
</P>
<P>
   Work on the WIPP began in the mid-1970s, though the idea for the
dump dates to the mid-1950s, when scientists began worrying about
how to deal with the clothing, debris, equipment, and other
materials inevitably contaminated when working with radioactive
elements. Most of that waste _ growing steadily by the year _ has
been stored in above-ground repositories while awaiting burial at
the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Once at WIPP, the disposal process calls for workers to remove
the drums from their protective containers, then transport them via
elevator into the salt beds about 2,150 feet below ground. They are
destined for holding rooms 300 feet long, 33 feet wide, and 13 feet
high, the walls and ceilings glistening with salt crystals. Once
filled with drums, the entrances to the rooms will be sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Energy Department officials say, the salt will do the
work. Over seven to 10 years, the rooms will collapse. Over the
next 100 to 150 years, the salt will solidify, trapping the wastes.
WIPP planners expect to fill 56 such rooms in the salt bed, which
they say has remained remarkably stable since it was formed 225
million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread support for the WIPP can be traced in part to the
people here being used to thinking about time in epochal
increments. They also are uniquely able to recognize the value of
underground resources. The reason: A cornerstone of the city's
economy is tourism at nearby Carlsbad Caverns, the site of
magnificent underground passages and limestone cave formations that
began taking shape 500,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of the dump's opening, the city was dotted with
``Welcome WIPP'' and ``WIPP YES'' signs, and a local radio station
posted a simple message on its lawn that spoke for many here:
``Finally.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be wrong, however, to interpret Carlsbad's embrace of
the WIPP as evidence the community is immune to the
not-in-my-backyard syndrome. Recently, plans to build a mental
health facility in a residential neighborhood were abandoned
because of local opposition, said Mayor Gary Perkowski, who is also
an assistant principal at the middle school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks here like the WIPP, but they aren't ready for everything
that means economic development,'' Perkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   But the economic promise of the plant was a prime factor in its
acceptance. Westinghouse Co., the main government contractor, has
brought hundreds of jobs to the city and has also become a
cherished corporate citizen through hefty donations of money and
volunteer hours. Carlsbad also imagines itself becoming a global
destination for the study of nuclear waste disposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just nuclear waste that's coming in with it, it's
jobs and money,'' said Franklin Holt, a cashier at a gas station
near the caverns.
</P>
<P>
   The trash destined for the WIPP will come mainly from 10 major
defense-related nuclear production facilities scattered around the
country, as far east as Savannah, Ga., and as far north as Hanford,
Wash. A smaller amount will be sent from 14 other temporary
disposal sites, laboratories, nuclear reactors, and research
facilities. Several are from the Northeast, but none are from New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the material being taken to the Carlsbad dump is
contaminated with plutonium, but the trash will contain other
radioactive elements as well. Federal law prohibits concentrated,
high-level nuclear wastes and spent nuclear fuel from disposal in
the WIPP.
</P>
<P>
   The WIPP site will contain only government-generated nuclear
waste. It will not accept radioactive garbage or other wastes from
commercial nuclear power plants. There is no permanent resting
place for those wastes, which for now remain in temporary storage
facilities or repositories.

METHODIST MINISTER IS CONVICTED OF BREAKING CHURCH LAW BY BLESSING
GAY UNION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Neb.)   (rk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A United Methodist Church minister in Chicago was found guilty
Friday of breaking church law by having blessed the union of two
gay men, in an ecclesiastical trial that drew national attention to
an increasingly controversial issue among many Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   After deliberating more than three hours, a jury of Methodist
clergy members voted 10-3 to convict the minister, the Rev. Greg
Dell, 53, of violating the United Methodists' ``order and
discipline'' in having officiated at the ceremony, which took place
at his urban church last September. Methodist rules require nine
jurors for a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after announcing the vote, the jury began hearing
witnesses to decide a punishment. Penalties can be as severe as
loss of ministerial credentials.
</P>
<P>
   How to relate to gay churchgoers is a question that has deeply
roiled many American religious organizations, just as it has proven
highly contentious among many secular institutions, like the
military. Roman Catholics and Jewish rabbinic and synagogue
organizations have debated the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the controversies have been particularly intense within
major Protestant denominations, like the United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Much debate has turned on whether to allow noncelibate gay
members to serve in clerical positions. Three years ago, for
example, a retired Episcopal Church bishop was brought before an
ecclesiastical court, accused of having violated church doctrine
for having ordained a gay man as a deacon; the court dismissed the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   But within the United Methodist Church _ with 8.5 million
members, the nation's second-largest denomination after the
Southern Baptist Convention _ controversy over homosexuality has
included the issue of same-sex unions, particularly since the
denomination's top policy-making body, in 1996, placed a statement
in the Methodist rule book barring such ceremonies being held in
Methodist churches or performed by Methodist ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, whose trial was held in a church in suburban Downers
Grove, Ill., with a retired bishop as judge, was the second
Methodist minister brought to trial for having performed a
same-same union.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, the Rev. Jimmy Creech, of Omaha, Neb., was
narrowly acquitted after his lawyers argued that the rule-book
statement was purely advisory. But Creech's bishop did not
reappoint him to his pulpit. Five months later, the Methodists'
Judicial Council ruled that the statement was binding.
</P>
<P>
   Dell officiated at a service for two men, one of them a member
of his congregation in Chicago, a month after the council's ruling.
During his trial, he argued that his pastoral responsibilities, as
a minister to a congregation with many gay members, required that
he break the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Creech, a friend of Dell's since their student days together at
Duke University Divinity School, attended the trial. After the
verdict, Creech said ``the only thing Greg was guilty of'' was
``being a pastor to members of his church.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Rev. Jeanne G. Knepper, a spokeswoman for Affirmation, a
Methodist caucus supportive of gay members of the church, said in a
telephone interview, ``I really grieve for the position the church
has put itself in, when it feels called upon to take its very best
pastors to trial for doing ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   But a quite different perspective was offered by Paul Lewis, a
lay member of a Methodist church in Aurora, Ill., who testified for
the prosecution as the jury began hearing arguments in the penalty
phase late in the afternoon. Lewis said many church members had
been upset by Dell's conducting the same-sex union, and were
holding back on financial contributions and personal commitment to
the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a feeling among many that if the clergy don't have to
obey, Why should we?'' Lewis said. ``The damage to the fabric of
our church here is severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Dell nor the Rev. Stephen C. Williams, chief counsel for
the church's Northern Illinois Conference, the area which Dell
serves and which brought the charge against him, could be reached
for comment after the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   But about 70 supporters of Dell gathered in a park across the
street from the Downers Grove church, singing, holding hands and
praying. One woman, Caroline Presnell, a member of a Methodist
church in Evanston, Ill., that Dell once served, said an issue
confronting the denomination was ``whether the church is going to
be inclusive as Jesus taught us to be, or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The group dispersed after singing ``Amazing Grace.''

BODY OF 3RD MISSING WOMAN FOUND ALONG HIGHWAY LEADING TO YOSEMITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The sorrowful mystery of what happened to three
tourists who disappeared from Yosemite National Park was in large
part answered Friday when the authorities announced that a body
found along a highway leading to the park was that of the last
missing person.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday evening, the authorities said that the body found
halfway between where the three women were last seen six weeks ago
and where their charred rental car was found last week with two
bodies in the trunk was that of Julie Sund. On Monday, the
authorities had identified one of the bodies in the trunk as that
of Julie's mother, Carole Sund. The authorities now assume that the
other body found in the car, whose identity was close to being
positively identified through DNA tests, is that of the third
member of the trio, Silvina Pelosso, a family friend visiting from
Argentina. Results of DNA tests are expected next week.
</P>
<P>
   But big questions still remain in a case that has captured the
attention of much of the nation: Who killed these women, where and
why?
</P>
<P>
   The women's disappearance touched off the most intensive
missing-persons search in recent memory, involving six
law-enforcement agencies, and the women's fate has sparked fear
among residents of the small, quaint towns in the Sierra Nevada
foothills, where the bodies were found, that a killer or killers
are among them. But it has also created a deeper, wider fear,
especially among women, that no one is safe anywhere when an
innocent weekend adventure for three can result in such a horror
story.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday evening in Sonora, the Tuolumne
County seat, James Maddock, the FBI special agent in charge of the
case, said that investigators searching for suspects were still
following up on hundreds of tips that have been made to an FBI hot
line over the last week. He said the case was being designated ``a
major case'' so that the authorities could bring as many resources
as they needed to solve the crime. He refused to comment on whether
they were close to making an arrest, on how investigators had
located the third body, and on the cause of death for any of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Sund, who was 42, had taken her eldest daughter, Julie,
15, and Silvina, 16, who was visiting the family in Eureka, to
Yosemite for a holiday on Presidents' Day Weekend. They were last
seen alive, according to the authorities, on the night of Feb. 15,
when they left the restaurant adjacent to the Cedar Lodge in El
Portal, a remote outpost at the western entrance to the park.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, the only concrete clue as to what might have
happened to the women was Mrs. Sund's wallet, found intact off a
highway in Modesto, two hours from El Portal, four days after the
trio disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators had searched Modesto and the mines, ravines and
woods around El Portal, only to have a passerby stumble upon the
car three hours away, in Tuolumne County, at a spot local residents
use as a dumping ground for cars and large appliances. The find was
baffling, given its location, but the discovery of the third party
lends some logic to a possible murder scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Sund's body was found near the town of Moccasin, on the
fastest route from El Portal to Sierra Village, where the torched
shell of the rental car with two of the victims inside was found.
The killer or killers could have dumped the one victim before
arriving at the spot where the car was set on fire. The location
where the body was found is also about halfway between El Portal
and Modesto, where relatives of the women have been staying at a
Holiday Inn since Carole Sund's wallet was found there.
</P>
<P>
   Jens Sund, Mrs. Sund's husband, went into seclusion about two
weeks ago in Eureka, with the couple's three other children.
Francis and Carole Carrington, Mrs. Sund's parents, and Raquel and
Jose Pelosso, from Cordoba, Argentina, have remained in Modesto to
answer questions from the press and keep the case prominent until
it is solved, they say. ``Somebody knows the whole story and we
want it out,'' Carrington said Friday. ``It's hard to sit and wait
for the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carringtons are a prominent family of real estate developers
from Santa Rosa who are now mostly based in Eureka. At the time the
three disappeared, there was speculation that the women had been
kidnapped for ransom, given Mrs. Sund's family wealth. But no
ransom note was ever found, and the authorities concluded that the
women were victims of random foul play.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have said that they are poring over parole
records in the areas as part of a hunt for suspects. Two men _ one
a convicted sex offender and the other on parole after a domestic
violence conviction _ who had been working at the Houtz Family
Restaurant, where the women were last seen, have been in custody in
the Mariposa County jail on unrelated charges, at the request of
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   A third man, who has convictions for attempted murder and rape,
and who grew up near where the charred car was found and now lives
in Modesto, was arrested last week on charges that he shot an
officer who tried to stop him for a routine traffic violation.
Neighbors say that in recent days investigators have questioned
them about the man and the Sund-Pelosso case.
</P>
<P>
   Residents and business people in towns near where the burned car
was found say they spotted the three a day or even two after the
last confirmed sighting, but investigators say that many of the
sightings cannot possibly be true. They say a roll of film found
near the charred rental car showed that the last date the women
were sightseeing was Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   While the car and everything near it was burned, the roll of
film, found among other items strewn near the charred car, was
intact. The authorities kept most of the developed roll as
evidence, but on Monday they released seven snapshots to the
victims' families. They are pictures of one or two of them at a
time, obviously taken by the third, and they show them in jeans and
sweatshirts, ice skating, posing in front of a breathtaking
waterfall, hiking along a river. They are postcard photos, the kind
placed in albums to rekindle memories of a wonderful time.

KEVORKIAN FOUND GUILTY OF SECOND-DEGREE MURDER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ Dr. Jack Kevorkian, who challenged authority on
national television when he injected a seriously ill man with a
lethal dose of chemicals, was found guilty Friday of second-degree
murder.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which marks the first time a jury has convicted
the world's most famous assisted-suicide advocate, is seen as a
symbol of the shift against Kevorkian and the right-to-die
movement. But even prosecutors said the issues are far from
settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never my intent or desire to participate in the
martyrdom of Dr. Kevorkian,'' said Dave Gorcyca, Oakland County
prosecuting attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the issue of mercy killing and assisted suicide
will remain a complicated moral and legal, medical and ethical
issue upon which we may never unanimously agree, despite the guilty
verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian showed no expression when the guilty verdicts on
charges of second-degree murder and delivery of a controlled
substance were announced. The former count carries a maximum
sentence of life in prison, while the latter has a maximum term of
seven years. Prosecutors said they would probably seek a sentence
in accord with guidelines that call for a minimum of 10 to 25 years
for a second-degree murder conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian promised the judge, who waived his bond, that he would
not participate in any assisted suicides until his sentencing on
April 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have kept my word up until now,'' said the 70-year-old
retired pathologist. ``And I will keep it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, he quietly left the courtroom, evading journalists.
</P>
<P>
   But David Gorosh, Kevorkian's legal adviser, denounced the
decision to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unjust to try to equate an act of compassion with an act
of murder,'' he said. ``I will say this _ Dr. Kevorkian will be
lauded in history as a hero. This issue will be resolved in our
lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorosh said Kevorkian has filed an appeal and has vowed to take
the case to the Supreme Court if needed.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 17, Kevorkian videotaped himself injecting Thomas Youk,
52, with a lethal dose of a chemical. Kevorkian provided the tape
to CBS, which broadcast the video on its ``60 Minutes'' program.
Youk was suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, better known
as Lou Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   On the video, Kevorkian dared prosecutors to charge him with
murder: ``I've got to force them to act,'' Kevorkian said on the
show. ``They've got to charge me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian was charged with first-degree murder, which would have
carried a mandatory life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Convicting him means the jury believes he was guilty of one of
the most serious crimes on the law books,'' said Larry Dubin, a
University of Detroit law professor who has followed Kevorkian's
trials. But deciding on second-degree murder showed that jurors
felt a life sentence would have been too harsh, Dubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian says he has helped 130 people kill themselves since
1990 as part of his campaign to legalize physician-assisted
suicide. Four of those people were Massachusetts residents: Judith
Curren, 42, of Pembroke, in August 1996; Barbara Ann Collins, 65,
of Falmouth, in October 1996; Jeremy Allen, 52, of Cambridge, in
February 1998; and William Connaughton, 42, of West Roxbury, in
March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Four trials on charges of violating Michigan's assisted-suicide
laws ended in acquittal three times and a mistrial in the fourth
case. In those cases, Kevorkian did not inject people, but used a
``suicide machine'' that allowed them to trigger the flow of lethal
drugs themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Kevorkian has been a beloved and sympathetic figure
in Michigan. But this decision, said longtime observers of
Kevorkian, reflected a rising sentiment against mercy killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking a little more objectively at him,'' said
prosecutor John Skrzynski. In the past, Kevorkian tried to pit
compassion against the law, but this time the law won, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, he came on the scene very quietly, advertising
his suicide machine in The Detroit Free Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a polarizing force almost from the start,'' said Brian
Dickerson, a columnist for the Free Press. ``He was the antichrist
for some and a prophet, ahead of his time, for others.''
</P>
<P>
   Flora Holzheimer, Kevorkian's younger sister, said that
everywhere he goes, people stop him to request an autograph.
Sometimes they roll down the window beside the car and give him a
thumbs up, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a hero,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Observers said that in 1995 and 1996, around his third
acquittal, Kevorkian seemed to grow bolder. During that time, he
assisted with nearly a dozen suicides. The Curren case in Pembroke
was especially controversial, because a post motem showed she
suffered from obesity, but was not terminally ill. Even his
supporters began to question Kevorkian's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the weakening of his support became evident when
Michigan voters rejected a referendum to legalize assisted suicide
and voted to make it illegal to assist in a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think because the the voters overwhelmingly rejected it, one
could infer that the public sentiment changed from public opinion
polls, which said most people favored the right to
physician-assisted suicide,'' Dubin said.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment appears to be expressed nationwide. Only Oregon
allows assisted suicide, while the practice has been rejected or
blocked in about 20 states in recent years and voted down in
referendums in Washington and California.
</P>
<P>
   The Youk case ``is Kevorkian's swan song,'' said Arthur Caplan,
director or the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Bioethics
in Philadelphia and a critic of Kevorkian. While saying that
Kevorkian did bring the right-do-die movement into the public
consciousness, Caplan said, the doctor now is ``running on fumes _
the fumes of media notoriety.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, many question whether Kevorkian will follow through on his
threat to go on a hunger strike and kill himself if sentenced to
prison. ``That would be a tragedy,'' said Gorosh.
</P>
<P>
   Holzheimer said that starving definitely is a possibility, but
hoped it would never get to that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has said that he will be an example at any cost,''
Holzheimer said. ``It hurts the sister, but I respect every wish.''

ON PRO BASKETBALL: SHARING JUST ISN'T SPREWELL'S STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Latrell Sprewell was talking hoops Friday night, how
it feels to dribble down the court and launch a jumper on a whim.
This is called ``balling'' on the playground, and the term is best
reserved for those players who move at warp speed and have no
conscience when they miss two, three, four shots in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that's fun,'' Sprewell said. ``And that's when
basketball is fun, going up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I would like to be in a system that caters to that
style of play. At this point in my career, I'm not going to
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Van Gundy convinced his bosses two months ago that
Sprewell, for all his baggage, was worth the risk. But if Sprewell
cannot decelerate and show he wants to do more than just play, the
coach who went to bat for him _ at a time when everyone else in the
organization was worried sick over Sprewell's coach-choking image _
could be out of a job.
</P>
<P>
   That vortex known as Patrick Ewing and the Knicks' offense has
absorbed the talents of many gifted players, and it could be said
that Ewing and his teammates need to get their rears down the floor
if they want to play with Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   But privately, at least two of Sprewell's teammates wish he
would wait for them to cross midcourt sometimes before chucking the
ball. They like his aggressiveness, but they question whether he
can incorporate them into his offensive mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   Old habits die hard, even on the court.
</P>
<P>
   This is a player, after all, who ran the floor unabated at
Golden State, the All-Star who had a green light and responded to
every defensive challenge the only way he knew how: shoot and shoot
some more.
</P>
<P>
   He played for a team that was used to losing, so there is a part
of him that must be wondering what all this New York fuss is over.
In the Bay Area, 15-13 is a more-than-decent record. Kurt Thomas,
the new power forward, played the last two seasons for a dismal
Dallas franchise. Marcus Camby, the other key off-season
acquisition, toiled for terrible Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are 6-9 with Sprewell in the lineup. Before he was
suspended for choking P.J. Carlesimo in December 1997, the Warriors
were 1-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just one of those stats,'' he said. ``That doesn't
bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, it should. Attitude means so much in this league,
and if losing was tolerated where you came from, it often takes a
while to cleanse that line of thought from your mind.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it takes longer than a three-games-in-three-nights
season.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main culprits for the Knicks' losses has been the
lack of practice time. There is a reason Van Gundy has not lost a
first-round series in his career, though the Knicks were underdogs
in two of them. Given three or more days, his preparation is
unparalleled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hurt us offensively,'' he said before last night's
game against Phoenix. ``You're trying to teach guys to play without
the ball and go through other players instead of waiting for the
ball to be brought to them. You're trying to show them it can work
better this way instead of playing four separate games of one on
one.''
</P>
<P>
   People can say the Knicks are too predictable, and blame Ewing
for every playoff failure if they want a convenient scapegoat. They
can say that Allan Houston is too soft and that the club needs a
bona fide point guard.
</P>
<P>
   But Sprewell is the key to this club turning its fortunes

   U.S. and allied forces tore deeper into the heart of the Serb
military machine Friday in a third day of air strikes across
Yugoslavia, as American warplanes shot down two Serb fighter jets
near a base of U.S. troops in neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, thousands of Serb troops backed with tanks
deepened their year-long campaign of terror, attacking villages and
ravaging homes amid unconfirmed reports of round-ups and summary
killings of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Across the region, anti-American violence swept as far away at
Greece, where an estimated 10,000 protesters marched on the U.S.
Embassy in Athens, hurling stones and bricks until they were
dispersed by riot police firing water cannons.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration found itself waging a
global campaign for public support for continuing the assault, even
as the Pentagon hunkered down for what could be a prolonged air war
on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin voiced outrage over the
escalating violence against ethnic Albanians, citing ''ominous''
reports of widening atrocities and warning that perpetrators would
be regarded as war criminals subject to trial and punishment once
the crisis ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are increasing reports of atrocities against Albanian
civilians in Kosovo,'' Rubin said. ``We are extremely alarmed by
these reports, and we are putting a great deal of resources and
effort into checking these out, as quickly as we can and as
thoroughly as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the unconfirmed reports the administration was looking
into were allegations by large numbers of refugees fleeing Kosovo
that up to 20,000 ethnic Albanians had been put on a forced march
by Serb troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking into it as best we can through the various means
that we have,'' said National Security Council spokesman P.J.
Crowley. ``I don't think that we are in a position to confirm any
details, but we are definitely checking into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Yugoslavia's Foreign Minister, Zivadin
Jovanovic, went on the CNN television network to decry the reports
of atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethnic Albanians (in the Serbian province of Kosovo) are
Yugoslav citizens,'' Jovanovic insisted. ``They enjoy equal rights,
equal opportunities, but terrorists have to be neutralized.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade claims that its military campaign in Kosovo has been
necessary to combat rebel groups of Kosovar Albanians pressing for
independence for the province of 2.2 million people, 90 percent of
whom are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin cited reports that Serb forces executed 20 ethnic
Albanians in the village of Goden on Thursday. The alleged killings
were reported by refugees from the region to the United Nations
High Commission on Refugees, which is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. officials would not confirm the killings, the
International Crisis Group, a private private humanitarian
organization in Washington, has monitored the situation. The
group's Balkans program coordinator Albert Cevallos reported the
following alleged atrocities:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On Friday, Albanian lawyer Bayram Keljmendi, who was
representing the Koha Ditore, one of the largest Albanian
newspapers, and his two sons allegedly were taken from their home
in the Kosovo provincial capital of Pristina, and executed by
Serbian troops. The three mens' bodies were reportedly seen about
one mile outside of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On Thursday, the warehouse for the Mother Theresa Society, one
of the largest local humanitarian organizations, was burned to the
ground near Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On Friday, the press agency for the separatist rebels, the
Kosovo Liberation Army, reported that 20 Albanians had been killed
in a mass execution in the town of Orahovac, and another 10 in the
town of Podujevo.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On Thursday, the warehouse for the Mother Theresa Society, one
of the largest local humanitarian organizations, was burned to the
ground near Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the starkest testimony to the terror has been the number
of ethnic Albanians -- 365,000 as of Friday -- who have fled their
homes, most with only those belongings they could carry, to escape
the onslaught of Serb troops and thugs.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the horror, NATO officials in Brussels reported Friday
that 300 hardened Serb criminals have been released in recent days
and added to the ranks of the rampaging patrols in Kosovo, a
reprise of a tactic Serbs unleashed to brutal effect in their 3
1/2-year war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said it would step up its satellite surveillance of
Kosovo by flying unmanned drone aircraft into the region to monitor
by low altitude camera what can no longer be witnessed firsthand in
a province where international monitors, journalists and aid
workers have been forced to flee.
</P>
<P>
   To date, NATO attacks have focused on Serb air defenses, early
warning radar sites, fuel and ammunition dumps, power stations and
command and control systems.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks began around 9 p.m. local time Friday in Yugoslavia,
with news reports of explosions in at least 11 suburbs ringing the
capital of Belgrade, where air sirens blared and a city-wide
blackout was imposed for a third straight night.
</P>
<P>
   While hitting at the headquarters and supply centers of the Serb
army, police and special forces believed responsible for the bulk
of the Kosovo oppression, the U.S. Air Force has refrained from
using its extensive capabilities for pursuing tanks and troops in
the fields and on the roads of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That could change in the days ahead, however, Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon told reporters in Washington, as the NATO strikes
continued to weaken Serb air defenses, reducing the dangers to NATO
pilots flying missions directly targeting Serb forces in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``As these strikes continue over the following days, we will, as
appropriate, increase the concentration and focus on targets within
Kosovo itself,'' said Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials insisted, however, that the Serbs' ongoing
attacks on civilians are an extension of the very Serb repression
that has prompted the NATO strikes and should not be regarded as
retaliation for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be somehow quite perverse to put the cart before the
horse and somehow conclude that it's NATO action which has given
President Milosevic a pretext to crack down,'' NATO spokesman Jamie
Shea told reporters at alliance headquarters in Brussels. ``He's
been cracking down without any pretext at all for the best part of
a year. We are intervening to stop that from happening, and to stop
it once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic is the president of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it vowed to ratchet up air attacks directly on the Serb
forces conducting the repression in Kosovo, though, the Pentagon
got a bone-rattling reminder of the perils of continued conflict in
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Yugoslav MiG-29 fighter jets managed to get within 25
miles of Tuzla, base for the 6,900 U.S. troops taking part in the
NATO peacekeeping operation in Bosnia, before being shot down by
two American F-15 fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb aircraft were spotted by a U.S. AWACS airplane flying
surveillance over the region, Bacon said. The AWACS alerted the
F-15 pilots, who were flying combat air patrols in the area and
quickly intercepted and destroyed the MiGs.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Friday, NATO patrols were searching for the Serb
pilots and the wreckage of the aircraft. Bacon said the MiGs'
mission remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts speculated, however, that Milosevic might have
hoped to slip past the NATO air defenses to stage a surprise attack
on the U.S. troops, stationed not far from where the MiGs were shot
down near the town of Teocak.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Mach 1, that's about 10 seconds from the Tuzla air base,''
said Balkans expert Bill Stuebner of the U.S. Institute for Peace,
a quasi-governmental think tank in Washington, D.C. ``Milosevic
must have decided to take a chance and send home body bags to the
United States to see how that would affect the dynamic here at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   His reference was to polls showing thin domestic support for
U.S.-led NATO strikes in Yugoslavia, a mission over which the
public is divided in a roughly even split.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to build public backing for his policy, President Clinton
planned to devote his Saturday radio address to the Kosovo crisis,
an issue he addressed the nation on when the air strikes began on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to reiterate his resolve to wage a long-term
air campaign against Serb military forces, unless Milosevic agrees
to an international peace plan for Kosovo.

RENAULT'S `COST KILLER' FACES TOUGH MISSION: RESCUE NISSAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Japan, Germany, Belgium, Brazil, Lebanon)   (EDS: Skedded as RENAULT-GHOSN on early budget.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Here is the question confronting Carlos
Ghosn: can his team of 40 French executives rescue a loss-plagued
Japanese car company with 40,000 employees?
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn, an executive vice president at Renault SA who is known as
Le Cost Killer, is now leading the French car maker's plan to
invest $5 billion in Nissan Motor Co., Japan's No. 2 auto maker.
That arrangement is expected to be formally announced Saturday in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   No other Western executive has ever reached such a pivotal
position in one of Japan's corporate giants. Even few Japanese
executives have had to push through the breadth of change needed by
Nissan, which has at least $21.2 billion in debt, five straight
years of losses and a poorly selling array of boring-looking cars
and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Renault itself was once plagued by losses and inefficiency until
Ghosn reversed the trend. His game plan at Nissan will depend on an
ability to push through drastic changes in Nissan's dull designs,
its Byzantine purchasing system and its entire socio-economic chain
of suppliers and affiliated companies, which altogether employ
200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn, who is originally from Brazilian, is expected to become
what amounts to Nissan's chief operating officer under the
agreement that will give Renault a 35 percent stake in the company.
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with Renault's operations say Ghosn will lead a
group of 40 Renault executives who will try to make Nissan more
efficient and fuse the two companies' strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn, who turned 45 a few weeks ago, joined Renault at the end
of 1996 and oversaw a wrenching program to reduce costs, earning
him the nicknames Le Cost Killer the Parachutist.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was born in Brazil, Ghosn spent much of his youth in
Lebanon and then studied engineering and business at France's elite
universities. He then worked for nearly two decades at Michelin,
the French tire producer, and ended up running its North American
business. Renault's chairman, Louis Schweitzer, recruited Ghosn as
his second-in-command and put him charge of the cost-cutting
program.
</P>
<P>
   Though analysts say Ghosn hardly deserves sole credit, Renault
has enjoyed a spectacular turnaround since his arrival.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Renault's sales had stagnated, its costs were out
of control and its 1996 losses _ the first in 10 years _ were
nearly $1 billion. In 1998, helped by brutal cost-cutting and its
popular line of minivans, it earned more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer, a shy and outwardly colorless executive, already had
decided that painful cuts were necessary by the time he recruited
Ghosn. But it was the exuberant Ghosn who mapped out the details of
a plan to trim about $3.5 billion in annual costs by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The plan unleashed a political uproar in Belgium, where Renault
announced that it would shut one of its newer factories and lay off
2,700 workers. Belgian labor unions and political leaders angrily
charged that Renault, in which the French government owns 44
percent of the shares, had callously decided to inflict the
harshest pain on Belgian rather than French workers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the protests, Renault did close the plant. It also made
major changes in the way it purchased components, greatly reducing
the number of its suppliers and working more closely with the ones
that it kept. Like many other European and American car companies,
Renault also reorganized its production by building as many
different models as possible on a single platform, or skeleton of
common components.
</P>
<P>
   ``We announced a 20-billion-franc cost-cutting program and said
that 40 percent of that would be achieved in 1998,'' Ghosn said in
a recent interview. ``In fact, we achieved 48 percent of those
reductions by 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Renault's interest was disclosed this year, Renault's
share price has fallen by nearly a third to about $37. Much of
decline is from investor fears that Nissan will be nothing but a
black hole for money.
</P>
<P>
   It also remains unclear how much control Renault will have.
Though Renault will be able to name several members to Nissan's
board of directors and obtain a veto over major corporate
decisions, the companies have not explained how they will share
power.
</P>
<P>
   But Ghosn has made it clear where Renault sees the
opportunities. Nissan, he noted recently, has a weak purchasing
system in which the company relies heavily on components made
in-house rather than by independent suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   One market analyst who has worked with Renault noted that
Western companies now rely on outside suppliers for about 70
percent of their components. Nissan buys less than half from
outside suppliers. If Nissan adopted Renault's system, analysts say
it could shave the cost of parts by 3 or 4 percent, which would
translate to hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn is also focusing on simplifying Nissan's platform
strategy. As essentially the invisible underpinnings of a car, a
platform is a broad series of components that are common to several
models. Renault produces 2 million cars a year on seven different
platforms. Nissan, which has many more models, produces 2.8 million
cars on about 25 platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Renault executives also say they will bring some flare and
excitement to Nissan's staid line. Throughout its ups and downs,
Renault has often been clever and creative in designing appealing
new vehicles. Its most recent hit is the Scenic, Europe's first
minivan, but one that is more compact than American vans, yet
roomier than European hatchbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nissan has very boring cars, though they have some that are
fabulously well-engineered,'' said Simon Miller, an automobile
analyst at Credit Lyonnais in London. ``The one thing Renault has
proven is that it is good at coming up with cars that people want
to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that nobody knows whether Ghosn and his small
band of outsiders will be able to steer Nissan in a new direction.
</P>
<P>
   As logical as it might be to buy more parts from outside
suppliers, the essence of Japan's industrial system amounts to
tight corporate networks that link big manufacturers with their
suppliers. Companies routinely own big stakes in many suppliers,
which makes it difficult to cut them off.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the questions about resistance to change within
Nissan's own ranks. Ford Motor Company struggled for years after it
acquired a minority stake in Mazda. Nissan, Japan's biggest car
company after Toyota, is much bigger than Mazda and has played a
crucial role in Japan's industrial policy.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Renault, speaking on condition of anonymity,
insist the company's executives scrupulously analyzed the risks.
They have spent weeks poring over financial records in order to
fully understand Nissan's off-the-books liabilities through
affiliated companies.
</P>
<P>
   Renault also had to make its decision in the uncomfortable
spotlight created by DaimlerChrysler AG, Nissan's first choice,
when it walked away from a deal with Nissan on March 10.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, of Credit Lyonnais, said Nissan might prove more willing
to change than outsiders expect. ``Nissan is in trouble and they
know they're in trouble,'' he said. ``They're being offered a
lifeline, and they're being offered a partnership with a company
that has been successful in its own market and won't want to tread
too much into its own market.''

   ``At Mach 1, that's about 10 seconds from the Tuzla air base,''
said Balkans expert Bill Stuebner of the U.S. Institute for Peace,
a quasi-governmental think tank in Washington, D.C. ``Milosevic
must have decided to take a chance and send home body bags to the
United States to see how that would affect the dynamic here at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   His reference was to polls showing thin domestic support for
U.S.-led NATO strikes in Yugoslavia, a mission over which the
public is divided in a roughly even split.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to build public backing for his policy, President Clinton
planned to devote his Saturday radio address to the Kosovo crisis,
an issue he addressed the nation on when the air strikes began on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to reiterate his resolve to wage a long-term
air campaign against Serb military forces, unless Milosevic agrees
to an international peace plan for Kosovo.

GLAUS STARTING AT SHORT _ FOR NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ With both Dave Hollins and Troy Glaus playing
well enough to earn the starting job at third base, Anaheim Angels
manager Terry Collins found himself with a tough decision. But he
has found the answer: Both will play.
</P>
<P>
   Hollins will start at third and Glaus will move to shortstop _
at least for the next couple of days. Glaus started at short Friday
and made two plays without an error.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got good-enough hands, he's got a strong-enough arm,''
Collins said. ``We've got to position him as best we can according
to the defensive charts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do whatever it takes,'' Glaus said. ``Obviously,
it's not permanent with Gary (DiSarcina) coming back. But it just
takes a few grounders for me to feel comfortable there. I've played
there all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks tunes up: Singer Garth Brooks was in uniform with the San
Diego Padres on Friday at Tempe Diablo Stadium, and as he has all
spring, signed autographs for fans, spoke with reporters and called
everybody ``sir'' and ``ma'am.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks is hitting .067 (1 for 15) in 10 games, and has made one
error in left field. He faced the Angels' Mike Magnante in the top
of the eighth Friday with a runner on third and two out. On the
first pitch, Brooks fouled out to the first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't pitch him any different than anybody else,'' Magnante
said. ``I threw a fastball low and away, just like I did the batter
before with Ruben Rivera.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' agreement with the Padres called for him to play with
the team for only a week. In turn, he would donate all of his
salary to the Touch 'Em All Foundation, a collaboration among
major-league players, entertainers and corporate partners that
benefits children's charities.
</P>
<P>
   But Brooks has stuck with it all spring, and said playing for
one of the Padres' minor-league affiliates _ possibly the Single-A
Rancho Cucamonga Quakes _ is not out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question will be, am I there to sell tickets or to play
baseball?'' Brooks said. ``... If I play in the minors, I don't
want to take someone's spot who deserves to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said his biggest fear playing with the Padres this spring
was embarrassing himself. ``But if you worry about that, you might
as well stay in the house all day. Of course, at my house that's
not so bad.''

 &HT;    Florida probe finds no price-fixing by makers of matzo for
Passover
 &HT;    By David Sedore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It happens every spring.
</P>
<P>
   Passover comes, the price of kosher-for-Passover matzo soars in
South Florida compared with metro New York and other areas. Angry
consumers complain the fix is in.
</P>
<P>
   But an 18-month investigation by Florida Attorney General Bob
Butterworth into Passover matzo manufacturing, distributing and
retailing refutes the conspiracy theory. The report says a regional
price-fixing scheme doesn't make much sense because it would be
just as easy _ and more profitable _ to do it nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Passover matzo is the unleavened bread traditionally eaten at
the Jewish holiday to commemorate the deliverance of the ancient
Hebrews from slavery in Egypt. Seemingly every year, South Florida
grocers sell Passover matzo at prices two or three times the price
in other metropolitan areas with large Jewish populations.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, angry constituents contacted U.S. Rep. Robert
Wexler (D-Boca Raton), who in turn asked Butterworth to
investigate. The issue even spawned a lawsuit in Palm Beach County
Circuit Court that charged the two domestic matzo manufacturers,
Manischewitz Co. LLC and Aron Streit Inc., with collusion.
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth's report illustrated the problem this way: During
the 1997 Passover season, a 5-pound box of Manischewitz Passover
matzo sold for $11.99 at Publix supermarkets in South Florida but
sold for only $3.99 at the Ralph's grocery chain in Los Angeles.
Similar discrepancies occur ever year in New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But the difference, according to Butterworth, can be explained
by competition. Grocery stores in other areas use Passover matzo as
a loss leader, an item sold below cost to draw customers into the
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Still, South Florida grocers say they're not making money on the
item.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not charging more than what we pay,'' said Carmen
Millares, community affairs manager for the Miami division of
Publix. ``Actually, we're losing money.''
</P>
<P>
   Publix has Passover matzo on special, charging $9.99 for a
5-pound box.
</P>
<P>
   The conspiracy theory went nowhere in court either. In 1997,
Palm Beach County resident Sylvia Confino sued Manischewitz and
Aron Streit alleging they fixed Passover matzo prices.
</P>
<P>
   Less than four months after filing the suit, Confino withdrew
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They convinced us that it would be exceedingly difficult for
us to show there was a conspiracy,'' said Boca Raton attorney Paul
Geller, who represented Confino.
</P>
<P>
   Said Jeffrey Weissman, a Fort Lauderdale attorney who
represented Aron Streit: ``They brought it on a wing and a prayer,
and no facts. It's closed. As far as we're concerned, it wasn't
worth opening.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are skeptics out there who believe something is
amiss somewhere. West Palm Beach residents Harold and Shirley
Morgenstern are among them, pointing to an ad from a New Jersey
newspaper showing matzo and other Passover fare priced well below
what the same items sell for in South Florida stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see a couple of cents difference,'' Shirley
Morgenstern said. ``They have to make a profit in New Jersey just
as they do here. I really don't buy it.''

 &HT;    Ethics of dying a quandary for legislators, physicians
 &HT;    By Sanjay Bhatt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A 72-year-old man suffers a stroke
during coronary artery bypass surgery and goes into a coma. The
man's living will forbids the doctor from keeping him on life
support after a week, but his children want the doctor to do
``whatever it takes'' to restore his health.
</P>
<P>
   What should be done?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all going to die at some point,'' said Dr. David Cohen,
chief of the renal section at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center
in West Palm Beach. ``The question becomes how do we use medical
technology in the best way to keep people healthy, but not misuse
it so we prolong the process of dying and the suffering that goes
along with it?''
</P>
<P>
   Medical professionals, ethicists and now state legislators are
struggling to strike a balance.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed bills in the Florida Senate and House would protect
health care providers who follow patients' Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR)
orders from criminal prosecution and lawsuits and direct the state
to develop standard DNR forms valid in all health care settings.
The bills also would require more ethics training to med students
in end-of-life care.
</P>
<P>
   The bills' most controversial aspect, however, would remove the
requirement that two doctors classify a patient as terminally ill
before following the patient's wish to abandon life-prolonging
procedures. Patients could state in living wills that they want
life-prolonging measures stopped or withheld if they are both
mentally and physically incapacitated.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say few doctors agree on how to define a ``terminally
ill'' condition. Florida law defines it as a condition ``caused by
injury, disease or illness from which there is no reasonable
probability of recovery and which, without treatment, can be
expected to cause death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The practical consequence is a lot of people are treated
against their will because an institution can't muster up two
physicians who will agree the patient is terminally ill,'' said
Kenneth Goodman, director of the University of Miami's Forum for
Bioethics and Philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 doctors, nurses, hospice workers and lawyers discussed
the ethics of end-of-life care at a Friday conference in Fort
Lauderdale led by the forum and sponsored by South Florida
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   One opponent of the bills said removing the requirement for two
doctors' approval could have harmful effects on patients,
especially the poor, elderly and minorities in a cost-conscious
health care system.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some corridors, there's a financial incentive to deny
care,'' said Jim Towey, president of Aging with Dignity, a
nonprofit organization in Tallahassee. ``A lot of the elderly say
they don't want their lives extended, then they get in that setting
and change their mind.

GUARDS IN FOREFRONT OF UCONN-OHIO STATE CLASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Khalid El-Amin was sitting behind the
microphone, his head bobbing, his legs jiggling, all the energy he
infuses into the Connecticut offense seeping out with nowhere to
go. An hour later, his counterpart, Ohio State's Scoonie Penn, sat
in the same spot, leaning his head so low over the table his
shoulders practically disappeared, his voice low, no movement
wasted.
</P>
<P>
   They are the players that, with their magnificent skills but
vastly different personalities, have carried their teams to the
Final Four and the brink of a national championship. For Ohio State
and its coach, Jim O'Brien, being here is a wonderful surprise, a
shocking result in a season he had hoped would end with a bid to
the National Invitation Tournament. For Connecticut's Jim Calhoun,
this tournament is long-sought redemption and validation, for all
the years he has won while building Connecticut into a national
power, and all the years his ability to reach basketball's promised
land has been doubted.
</P>
<P>
   They will meet Saturday, in the first national semifinal. And
Calhoun is probably thrilled he drew the Buckeyes (27-8) in the
semifinal, because he has owned O'Brien of late, beating him in
their last 18 meetings. But it is unlikely that in all those games,
there has ever been a guard matchup quite as compelling as the one
anticipated Saturday, a face-off between two tandems with opposite
strengths, but who are integral to their teams' chances of
advancing to Monday's championship. If O'Brien had had a backcourt
at Boston College like the one he has now, he would have won more
than three games in 23 tries against Calhoun. If Calhoun had always
had backcourts as good as this one, this wouldn't be the first trip
to the Final Four for the Huskies (29-3).
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State's guards _ point guard Penn and shooting guard
Michael Redd _ make up perhaps the best backcourt in the nation.
They are the offensive bedrocks for the Buckeyes, the only players
who average in double figures _ Penn, 17.1 points and Redd, 19.7.
They have propelled fourth-seeded Ohio State on their remarkable
run through the tournament. They have provided more than half of
the Buckeyes' points in the tournament, and each has raised his
game in the last two weeks, with Redd averaging 21 points in the
four tournament games and the 5-foot-10-inch Penn, who is averaging
17.5 points, improving on defense and leading the team in
rebounding with 29 in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say they're the best backcourt we've faced all year,''
Connecticut's Ricky Moore said. ``No other backcourt does 70 to 75
percent of the scoring. Khalid and I can go out and prove that
we're one of the best backcourts in the country as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's backcourt is better known than the Buckeyes'
largely because of the outsized personality of point guard El-Amin.
The plump spark plug, despite being an erratic scorer, launches the
Huskies' locomotive of a transition game, leading the team with 56
steals.
</P>
<P>
   But the real strength of this backcourt is not offense. Moore,
the shooting guard, is perhaps the best defensive player in the
tournament. He has guarded the opposition's greatest threat all
season: he held Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves to 6 points on
2-of-15 shooting in December, and he will probably start against
Penn on Saturday. But if Redd, who will likely be guarded by
Richard Hamilton to start the game, gets hot early, Moore will
switch to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 27 years, I've never had anybody _ and I've had some great
defenders _ that could literally tear the head off a dragon, stop a
jump shooter,'' Calhoun said. ``He's played kids from 5-6 to 6-8.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Kevin Freeman said, ``I have as much confidence in him
as I have in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   This sort of backcourt duel was anticipated in the South
Regional final between Ohio State and St. John's. It never
materialized. Redd and Penn thoroughly outplayed Erick Barkley and
Bootsy Thornton, holding them to 21 points on 11-of-27 shooting,
while Redd and Penn scored 42 points on 15-of-30 shooting. That
sort of dominance is unlikely to be repeated here because neither
Barkley nor Thornton is the defensive stopper that Moore is. These
backcourts are more likely to cancel each other with high levels of
play, leaving the game to be decided by their respective front
courts, in which Connecticut would have the edge with the
all-American Richard Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfair to say that one or two players will dictate the
game,'' Connecticut center Jake Voskuhl said. ``It's a total team
effort. If you say the guards are shooting great, who is setting
the picks to get them open? If we set the picks and they don't hit
their shots, no one looks good.''
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   Duke center ELTON BRAND has fended off questions about whether
he will leave college for the National Basketball Association after
this season. But his teammates expect Brand to go. ``I have to be
honest with you, I don't think he'll be back,'' CHRIS BURGESS said.
``I wouldn't bet on him returning. If it were in his position, I'd
go, too.'' &QL;

CARDS SNATCH FREDRICKSON FROM LIONS  
 MILLER'S RETURN UNLIKELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Four days after linebacker Jamir Miller rejected
the Cardinals' final offer, the team outbid the Detroit Lions for
outside linebacker Rob Fredrickson and signed him to a four-year
contract on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The move likely ends Miller's chances of returning to the
Cardinals, who offered him a two-year, $6 million deal last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With Fredrickson signing an $8 million deal, which included
about a $2 million signing bonus, the contract will count about $2
million against next season's salary cap, leaving the Cardinals
with about $1.7 million available under the $57.3 million cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessarily over, but it diminishes the likelihood
that something will happen with Jamir,'' Cardinals Vice President
Bill Bidwill Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the Cardinals' first-round draft pick in 1994 and their
leading tackler last season, visited the Chicago Bears and New
England Patriots but didn't receive an offer from either team. The
Tennessee Titans also have shown interest in him.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's agent, Steve Baker, said he wasn't surprised the
Cardinals signed Fredrickson, 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Cardinals told us on Monday that if Jamir didn't
accept their offer at $6 million, Jamir realized they likely would
sign another player,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday afternoon, Fredrickson, a 6-foot-4, 240-pound
fifth-year pro, appeared headed back to the Lions.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals then stepped up and increased their offer, beating
the reported $1.9 million a year the Lions had offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little numb,'' said Fredrickson, a 1994 first-round pick
of the Los Angeles Raiders out of Michigan State. ``It did happen
so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled to be playing for the Cardinals. I felt I was
wanted here. They really embraced me. I didn't get that feeling
with the Lions.''
</P>
<P>
   Fredrickson's Phoenix-based agent, Eric Metz, said that ``from
the first day of free agency (Feb. 12), Rob wanted to be an Arizona
Cardinal.''
</P>
<P>
   Fredrickson won't necessarily replace Miller in the lineup. The
Cardinals could place him on the right side and move Patrick Sapp
to the starting left linebacker spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will still likely have to address our linebacker need in
the draft, but it takes a little bit of pressure off of us having
to do it quite as early in the draft,'' said Rod Graves, the
Cardinals assistant to the president who oversees pro and college
scouting. ``It gives us the luxury of adding another position or
two.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, who choose eighth and 21st overall in next
month's draft, could spend their two first-round picks on filling
needs at wide receiver and offensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers coach Glenn Pires said he has been impressed with
Fredrickson since he began studying him two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing he brings to the table is he's a very intelligent
player who is extremely versatile,'' Pires said. ``From a coverage
standpoint, he has a lot of ability. He makes good decisions when
he plays. He's a very instinctive guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fredrickson has started 67 games in five seasons, including all
16 games for the Lions last season. He is coming off his best
statistical year, finishing with 116 tackles, 2.5 sacks and one
interception.
</P>
<P>
   He played 98 percent of the Lions' plays last season, which is
unusual in this age of situational substitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes him so valuable,'' Metz said. ``Guys usually
play the run very well or the pass very well. Very few guys can do
both.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's also a guy who will play hurt. . . . He realizes that the
most important thing is durability.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Fredrickson, ``When you're getting paid a lot of money,
you're not getting paid to sit on the bench.'' &QL;

DUKE COACH RANKS AS BEST OF THIS TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - The ranks are full of slick-talking
contenders and white-haired wonders, climbers who have won in
backwater outposts and miracle-workers who have revived programs
pinned with a coroner's certificate.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no ambiguity at top. Mike Krzyzewski is simply the
best coach of his time. End of debate, beginning of a new era.
</P>
<P>
   He is a coach who built a dynasty in Dean Smith's back yard,
only to watch it crumble from a hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   A coach reduced to a shell of a man, frightened and frail,
wondering if his run was permanently over.
</P>
<P>
   A coach who looked in the mirror, re-evaluated the landscape of
college basketball, re-defined his own being.
</P>
<P>
   Architect of another budding powerhouse, in a time when they
shouldn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that is this program stems from him,'' Duke star
Trajan Langdon said.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to believe now that Duke is threatening to book-end the
decade with sheer domination, but sometime in 1994, after a
three-pointer from Arkansas' Scotty Thurman prevented a third
national championship, it all fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Valvano, one of his closest friends in the business, died of
cancer. Then came the aching in his back and the day his wife told
him he couldn't come home until he saw a doctor. Then the back
surgery and a foolhardy return to the office within a week. And,
finally, surrender. A return to the hospital, a diagnosis of
exhaustion, a mandate from the administration that he was done for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Under a gentleman named Pete Gaudet, Duke finished 13-18 that
season, 2-14 in the ACC. The pipeline of talent had burst, and the
program had diverted into the hands of strange company, players
like Eric Meek, Chris Collins, Steve Wojciechowski.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in short, a mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat a lot of nights together where he questioned whether he
would ever do this again, whether he could do this again, whether
it would be too hard for him, whether he would have what it takes
to ever do it again,'' his wife, Mickie, told ESPN last week. ``He
knew he'd be starting over.''
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski is nothing without his roots, a man who grew up on
the south side of Chicago, served his country, played under Bobby
Knight at West Point. An old-school sort who landed at Duke as an
unknown curiosity. But in his darkest hole, he changed.
</P>
<P>
   He hired a time manager to handle his schedule. He revamped his
coaching staff, employing three former players _ Johnny Dawkins,
Quin Snyder and David Henderson _ who could relate to kids in a new
age of recruiting. And he hit the road with a renewed purpose, to
restore the glory of Duke.
</P>
<P>
   He snagged Elton Brand from New York, plucked William Avery out
of Georgia, snagged Shane Battier from Michigan. And he pulled off
the impossible, landing Corey Maggette without the bait of a
starting job.
</P>
<P>
   Some professional scouts will tell you with a straight face that
Maggette would be the No. 1 pick in the upcoming draft. To convince
him is to convince the world, that Krzyzewski, above everyone else,
is the coach you want to play for.
</P>
<P>
   He took his team to the Great Alaska Shootout, Langdon's
hometown. He scheduled a game in Chicago so Maggette could perform
in his own backyard. And you wonder where the loyalty comes from?
</P>
<P>
   He took the best of Bobby Knight and left the worst behind.
Knight is a dinosaur, a man who refuses to change, which is why he
doesn't even rank among the top 20 coaches anymore. Knight caused a
stir after a victory over Northwestern this season when he
misinterpreted crowd chants of ``Who's Your Daddy,'' embarrassingly
ignorant to the lingo of youth.
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski has stayed current, and that's why he's here. A man
who matched John Wooden's 47 tournament victories last week and may
one day pass Wooden's record of 12 Final Four appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've enjoyed this whole year as much as I've enjoyed any
year,'' Krzyzewski said. ``Going through a few things, that's
helped me appreciate even more the journey that you go on with
these kids. I feel as good as I've ever felt about coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   You can forget the chatter about this Duke outfit ranking among
the best teams in history. There are 29 players in the NBA who
could've affected this tournament, and if you allocate them among
the top 10 programs, the face of college basketball changes
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   And since 1976, 18 teams have entered the tournament with one
loss or less. None of those teams ever cut down the nets, and
whether this tournament is remembered as the Duke Invitational
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't make it, believe me, we'll be very disappointed,''
Krzyzewski said. ``But we will have had a great experience, and
that's where I think I've been better as a coach. If you talk to
our kids, I would hope that you'd never feel they were under any
pressure. Rather, they've enjoyed what they do. And you have to
give them time to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, some things haven't changed. Krzyzewski, 52, is still tough
on the tongue and demanding of his players. He can still swear like
a sailor and drown you with numbers, none more staggering than
seven Final Four appearances in nine years, eight altogether. But
they only frame the story, and inside is a remarkable journey of a
coach who rolled with the times when so many resist. A man who
re-dedicated himself to a mission that has landed the Blue Devils
in the familiar garb of favorites.
</P>
<P>
   He walks with a limp now, slated for hip replacement surgery in
the off-season. But if all goes well, he will scale the ladder once
again, scissors in hand, trophy on its way.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he doesn't, the toughest climb is over. A man who went
up and down and back again. Right to the top of his profession. &QL;

IRL HAS A FUTURE, PIR OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In time, Tony George and Andrew Craig may decide one
sanctioning body is better than two. Then again, they may not.
</P>
<P>
   For now, George, who heads the Pep Boys Indy Racing League, and
Craig, the Championship Auto Racing Teams leader, appear content
with the status quo, even if the status quo means attendance woes
at some venues and poor television ratings at most.
</P>
<P>
   But that's OK, said Arie Luyendyk, a two-time Indianapolis 500
champion sitting out Sunday's IRL-sanctioned MCI WorldCom at
Phoenix International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, I think the IRL will be very successful with just
oval-type racing because Americans tend to love oval racing,'' said
Luyendyk, whose only on-track appearance this season will be at the
Indy 500. ``So quit comparing it to CART. Comparing the IRL with
CART is like comparing NASCAR to CART. It's a different ballgame,
two different series.
</P>
<P>
   ``So leave it alone. Take the IRL for what it is on its own. If
you just looked at what's been going on at the racetrack, it's
wheel to wheel racing.''
</P>
<P>
   No argument there.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, last season included several exciting IRL on-track
skirmishes.
</P>
<P>
   CART, too.
</P>
<P>
   But what also has transpired in the three years since the split
is fans appear to have become polarized.
</P>
<P>
   It seems fans either love CART or hate it.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto the IRL.
</P>
<P>
   The love-or-hate relationship has been especially noticeable at
PIR, where three previous IRL productions have been box-office
flops.
</P>
<P>
   Although CART crowds were dwindling at PIR before the break-up,
down to about 45,000 in its final season here in 1995, IRL
attendance has been abysmal.
</P>
<P>
   PIR refuses to release attendance figures, but it is believed
last year's attendance was a paltry 15,000.
</P>
<P>
   No problem.
</P>
<P>
   PIR officials repeatedly have stated their intent to remain an
IRL-affiliated track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that we've had growth every year since the
first IRL race here,'' PIR Vice President and General Manager Robin
Braig said. ``No matter what anyone says, we're making money on IRL
races and we think over time it's going to continue to grow and
grow. We're in this for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tony George said it would take several years to grow the
series, he wasn't lying about that. We knew it would take time. But
we, too, have the courage to grow our event as well as support the
IRL.''
</P>
<P>
   When told to take the IRL or leave it, however, some fans have
left it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to love to go to Phoenix and watch Indy-car races,''
said fan Patric McNulla of Edison, N.J. ``There used to be six of
us who'd meet in San Diego and drive over. But none of us go
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even watch the (Indy 500). And I won't buy any sponsor
product connected to the IRL. I felt like if I did, all I'd be
doing is perpetuating (the IRL). The whole thing is really
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Stupid, yes, Brad Edwards of Plainfield, Ind., agreed. But CART
is the guilty party, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony George did the right thing in forming the IRL to save
open-wheel racing,'' Edwards said. ``The drivers who busted their
guts on the bullrings of America were being shunned by CART.
</P>
<P>
   ``CART did absolutely nothing to enhance open-wheel reacing in
the 1980s. They let NASCAR run away with the fans and did nothing
to curtail this from happening. CART's egotistical owners could not
agree on anything that was for the betterment of the sport. All
they cared about was what was best for them.''
</P>
<P>
   All fan Ken Foust knows is that he's unhappy with the IRL
product.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRL is basically a glorified club racing league, led by
famous dirt racing heroes,'' said Foust, who splits time between
homes in Phoenix and Sacramento. ``The IRL is just not in the same
league as CART.''
</P>
<P>
   IRL car owner Dick Simon has been on both sides. A former CART
driver and team owner, Simon pledged his support with the IRL
following its creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRL is the best thing in the world,'' Simon said. ``The
media has tried to create this animosity and competitiveness
between the two series, saying we need to get back together, that
we're ruining racing. But that's not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``The TV ratings are getting better and the fan base is growing
rapidly. People talk about us losing New Hampshire (International
Speedway), but I remember when it was a CART race and they were
begging the crews to sit in the (grandstands).
</P>
<P>
   ``In time, everything will be rectified. We're two different
series. You've got a Formula One series in America called CART, and
you've got an Indianapolis-type racing series called the IRL.
</P>
<P>
   ``And with my $3.5 million budget, I can compete with anyone for
the front row in the (Indy 500).''
</P>
<P>
   But what has happened to the Indy 500? Has it lost some of its
luster, as some suggest?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year, yes,'' said Luyendyk, who won a second Indy
500 in 1997. ``But the second year it was a little less (tarnished)
and the third even less. As we go along, it will be all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, it always takes time to develop something. You
can't be great right out of the box. But if you look at the drivers
in the IRL, they're good drivers. They're just not known to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it used be that way in CART, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending Indy 500 champion Eddie Cheever Jr., a native
Phoenician now living in Orlando, has grown weary of the CART vs.
IRL subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's irrelevant,'' Cheever said. ``They (CART) have their
series and we have our series. All this animosity, let's just get
over it. It's done.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't be done, McNulla said, until the two sides reach a
mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's quit all the arguing and find a way to compromise,''
McNulla said. ``We need to bring the two together because I just
don't think there's room for both series.'' &QL;

DUKE WOMEN ELBOW THEIR WAY INTO CHAMPIONSHIP GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Ga., Ind., La.)  (mk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Duke, a bit player in women's college
basketball until recent seasons, continues its captivating run
through a tournament usually dominated by a select few powerhouse
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils advanced to Sunday's title game of the NCAA
tournament with a thorough 81-69 victory over Georgia Friday night
at the San Jose Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils will play the winner of Friday night's second
semifinal game between Purdue (32-1) and Louisiana Tech (30-2).
</P>
<P>
   Duke (29-6) won as it did when it upset three-time defending
national champion Tennessee in Monday's East Regional final _ with
the dependable inside play of 6-foot-6 center Michele VanGorp and
the scrappy play of guards Nicole Erickson, Georgia Schweitzer and
Peppi Browne.
</P>
<P>
   And Duke won with an infectious enthusiasm and a weaving,
pass-happy, team-oriented offense that involved every player on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils do not like to be called the underdogs of this
tournament; their coach, Gail Goestenkors, maintains that their
goal was a national championship all along. But Duke is at least
the wunderkind of the tourney and its best story, especially since
its men's team is the favorite to win the national title in St.
Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Duke controlled most of the first half and charged to a 13-point
lead early in the second. But Georgia's pressure defense allowed
the Lady Bulldogs (27-7) to cut Duke's lead to 6 points at the
midpoint of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The twins Coco and Kelly Miller each hit baskets, taking
advantage of the absence of VanGorp, who sat out for three minutes
with three fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Miller's two free throws cut Duke's lead to 60-54, but
Hilary Howard sank two free throws to rebuild Duke's 8-point edge.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams seemed fatigued as the game _ played at a frantic
pace from the opening tip _ wound into its final eight minutes. And
with that fatigue, contact between the players was more common,
something that played to Georgia's disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Duke shoots 77 percent from the free throw line as a team, with
a handful of its players making more than 80 percent of their foul
shots this season.
</P>
<P>
   When Schweitzer made two free throws with 7 minutes 38 seconds
left in the game, Duke's lead was once again in double figures,
64-54. VanGorp added two free throws to extend the lead to 12
points.
</P>
<P>
   On Georgia's next possession, Coco Miller went to the foul line
but missed the front end in a one-and-one situation. Erickson
followed with a driving layup, VanGorp then blocked a shot by
Tawana McDonald and Erickson hit a fallaway jumper as the shot
clock expired to give Duke a 70-55 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After a basket by McDonald, Erickson delivered another
staggering blow to any Georgia hopes of a comeback, hitting a
3-point shot from the corner. If that didn't wound Georgia's
morale, then a 3-pointer by Lauren Rice with 3:02 left must have,
as it gave Duke a 76-57 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, however, scored 10 unanswered points, cutting the Duke
lead to 76-67 with 1:22 to play, when a Duke turnover led to Kelly
Miller's layup. Erickson hit another 3-point basket with 47 seconds
left to protect the Blue Devils' lead.
</P>
<P>
   The furious pace of the first half initially suited Duke, which
sprinted to a 17-7 lead. But the Blue Devils' offense was mostly
perimeter shooting, which masked a bigger Duke problem _ its
inability to get the ball inside to VanGorp.
</P>
<P>
   VanGorp rarely touched the ball early in the game and faced a
double-team when she did. She took just two shots in the game's
first 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Duke was concerned that its star guards,
Schweitzer and Erickson, who are both 5-6, would have trouble
getting open looks at the basket against Georgia's twin guards,
Kelly and Coco Miller, who are both 5-10. But motion and a series
of screens in the backcourt repeatedly sprung both Schweitzer and
Erickson, who combined for 16 first-half points. Schweitzer's
3-point basket gave Duke a 10-point lead, but Georgia quickly
scrambled back.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs did so with the tenacious defense that has become
their trademark. Georgia held four previous tournament opponents to
an average of just 58 points and had an average victory margin of
16 points. Georgia's frontcourt tandem of Angie Ball and McDonald
kept VanGorp out of sync as Georgia rallied.
</P>
<P>
   Coco Miller hit a leaning jumper off a screen set by her sister
and Deana Nolan drove the baseline for two baskets. Ball and
McDonald added inside baskets as the Lady Bulldogs tied the game at
25-25.
</P>
<P>
   Then VanGorp suddenly found her game. VanGorp, the star of
Duke's upset victory over Tennessee in the East Regional final,
scored 8 of the Blue Devils' last 12 points as Duke took a 40-34
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   VanGorp's inside task was made easier by the penetration of
Erickson and Browne. Ball and McDonald had to leave VanGorp's side
to defend Browne, leaving VanGorp open near the basket for easy
putback points.
</P>
<P>
   The intermission did not cool VanGorp's hot hand, and she
started the second half with a 3-pointer from the corner. It was
only VanGorp's second 3-point shot of the season, and she added a
pull-up jumper on Duke's next possession.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia coach Andy Landers had feared that his team's aggressive
defense would send Duke players on a parade to the free throw line
and get his team into foul trouble. It did not happen in the first
half when Duke shot just five free throws. But in the second half,
Duke's backcourt quickness seemed to be wearing on Georgia.

`MAGIC VS. BIRD' A WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Every basketball fan knows that Larry Bird and Magic
Johnson saved the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Before they came along, the league had descended into a haze of
selfish play, declining ratings, drug rumors and half-empty arenas.
Their personal rivalry, along with that of the Boston Celtics and
the LA Lakers, changed all that.
</P>
<P>
   What's sometimes lost in the swirl of memories is the way the
two changed March Madness as well.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't remember the 1979 NCAA Championship, in which
Bird's undefeated Indiana State Sycamores met Magic's Michigan
State Spartans _ or even if you do _ tune in to Fox Sports Arizona
at noon Sunday for ``Magic vs. Bird: the Game That Changed the
Game.'' It's a detailed look not just at the final game, but at the
two teams' march toward it. Hosted by Chris Myers (still kind of
weird to see him on a network other than ESPN), the show includes
interviews with the two principals, of course, as well as with
teammates, coaches and broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magic vs. Bird'' isn't the best documentary you'll ever see,
but plenty of great clips make it well worth watching. The
producers have done an excellent job of providing footage of
seemingly everything anyone talks about.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Magic says he learned to handle the ball by
dribbling to the grocery store. He dribbled with one hand on the
way there; on the way back, he dribbled with the other hand while
carrying groceries. And sure enough, in a grainy home movie, we see
little Ervin balancing a full grocery bag while keeping his
dribble.
</P>
<P>
   In another segment, a teammate of Bird's describes a legendary
move in which a defender blanketed Bird in a corner. Bird took the
ball behind his head and passed it, with both hands going over the
defender's head.
</P>
<P>
   Except that he didn't. Bird didn't let go of the ball. The
defender leapt around, looking for the pass. Bird straightened up
and nailed a long-distance jumper. When the description ends, we
see it. And it is fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   Like any sports documentary, ``Magic vs. Bird'' suffers from an
overdose of seriousness; sometimes it seems as if the people being
interviewed are talking about the invasion of Normandy instead of
college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the game ``was'' important, at least in the sports
universe. It's rare when you can predict that any player will
become larger than the sport, but here were two of them in the same
game.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, the network that broadcast the NCAA Finals then, realized
this and hyped the game accordingly. A pre-``Today'' show Bryant
Gumbel introduced the coverage, promising a treat for ``those who
believe in Magic and those who appreciate the beauty of a rare
Bird.'' (It paid off _ this is still the highest-rated NCAA Finals
ever.) So thank the network for the endless March Madness
promotions we see on CBS today. Or blame it, depending on your
point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bird says he didn't even notice the televised build-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to play and win the game,'' he says. ``All that
outside stuff meant nothing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's fun to see and hear the old triumvirate of Dick Enberg,
Billy Packer and Al McGuire call the game. And it's always
entertaining to see the short shorts that players wore in the
pre-Jordan era.
</P>
<P>
   But it's downright inspirational to relive Bird and Magic's play
_ their teamwork, their passing, their incredible skill. As Enberg
says, it's almost as if they were NBA players competing in a
college game.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State won handily, a fact that obviously still pleases
Magic and bothers Bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``It breaks my heart,'' Bird says. ``It really does.''
</P>
<P>
   Magic understands, he says, and offers a clue to the secret of
their rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know these type of things,'' he says, ``because we're
winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Winners, as ``Magic vs. Bird'' shows, from a long way back. &QL;

DUKE COULD OVERRUN   SPARTANS' GAME PLAN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Michigan State has a plan. Reduce the
94-foot court to an 8-foot battle zone. Crowd the foul lanes at
both ends of the floor with elbows spread. Contain the Duke
sharpshooters and slow down the pace of the Final Four semifinal
game at Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   Like most plans, Michigan State's looks pretty good on paper.
The Spartans have outrebounded 35 of 37 opponents and, in four
tournament games, pulled down an average of 11 more offensive
rebounds than their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   They have demonstrated mental toughness by winning 33 games,
seven of them decided by eight points or fewer, four of them
masterpieces that went down to the wire and were won by a single
basket.
</P>
<P>
   Against Kentucky in the Midwest Regional final, Michigan State
did not panic after being down 13 points in the first half and
showed that its grit was marbled with poise.
</P>
<P>
   But Michigan State coach Tom Izzo acknowledges the difficulty in
making his strategy succeed. His team needs to execute it against a
Blue Devil team that has won 36 games by an average of 25.9 points
and boasts dominant players in point guard William Avery, center
Elton Brand and the all-America guard Trajan Langdon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a point guard like they do, they can
penetrate,'' Izzo said. ``When he does, he'll kick out to Langdon,
who will either shoot or pound it into Brand. Some said they
haven't rebounded well as a team. I look at them and see they're
not missing many shots, and getting a lot of steals. When you do
that, you don't have to get a lot of rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils shot 60 percent overall and 58 percent from the
3-point line while winning the East Regional final over Temple. But
Michigan State has plenty of bodies _ a nine-deep rotation _ to
chase Langdon and company on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Spartans' bench, led by its leading scorer,
Morris Peterson (13.5), has been outscored only once this year. The
Spartan substitutes understand how important their roles are if
they are to beat Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the potential to go on some runs during the game and
if we can weather those and hang tight and go on our runs, too, it
should play a big part in the game,'' said A.J. Granger, the
Spartans' 6-foot-9-inch forward.
</P>
<P>
   In Mateen Cleaves, Michigan State has a tenacious point guard to
challenge Avery. Cleaves perhaps is the key to forcing the game
inside on both ends of the floor, as well as dictating the pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that they're a great rebounding team,'' Duke
coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ``It's also obvious that they can
really move the ball up the court quickly to get early offense.
Those are two areas we have to be good in. If we don't, we lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves needs to play better and make wiser decisions than he
did in a 73-67 loss to Duke in December. Avery had 14 points, five
assists and one turnover, while Cleaves scored just nine points on
3-of-17 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to concentrate on doing a better job for my team,''
Cleaves said. ``I don't want shooting to dictate my game. This time
I have to do a better job running my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski has prepared his team for a slow, physical game. The
Spartans' Antonio Smith _ a 6-9, 250-pounder _ will try to minimize
the number of times Brand touches the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebounding is one of the keys to the game,'' Brand said.
``Check the stats: they have rebounded almost 50 percent of their
missed shots in the tournament. There's going to be a lot of
banging and wrestling.''
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski acknowledged that a tight game favors Michigan State.
While the Spartans have demonstrated the ability to win close
games, Krzyzewski's young team has played in only four games
decided by 8 points or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a huge advantage there and many other areas,''
Krzyzewski said. ``I expect it to be a close game. They're too
good. I think we're good. And so I would hope that when our kids
are in that position that we'll win.''
</P>
<P>
   Izzo and the Spartans just want a chance to win. It would mean
that the game plan put them in position to beat a team that Izzo
calls flawless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't lie to my guys,'' Izzo said. ``If Duke plays their `A'
game, I don't think many teams can beat them, including us. Our job
is to make sure they don't play their `A' game.'' &QL;

CBS-KING WORLD DEAL TALKS REPORTED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CBS has been in preliminary discussions to acquire King World
Productions, the syndicator of such hit shows as ``Oprah'' and
``Wheel of Fortune,'' executives close to the talks said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two companies have been talking for several weeks,
the discussions are still premature and could end any time. King
World's stock price hit a 52-week high of $31.3125 Friday in active
trading, before closing up $1 at $29.9375. Any deal is expected to
have a small premium because of King World's recent stock price
runup, said the executives.
</P>
<P>
   While some have suggested that Mel Karmazin, president and chief
executive of CBS, is willing to pay cash for the company _ King
World has a market value of $2.1 billion _ it has not been ruled
out that any deal could be a stock swap.
</P>
<P>
   A possible combination makes sense, analysts said. CBS and King
World have been successful partners with the new ``Hollywood
Squares,'' which is broadcast on CBS. But King World's other
brand-name shows, like ``Jeopardy'' and ``The Oprah Winfrey Show,''
are syndicated to ABC stations well into the next millennium. That
could prove troublesome for CBS or any buyer if the stars of those
shows, particularly Oprah Winfrey, decided to bolt once those
contracts had expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oprah can bolt at any time,'' said Harry DeMott, a broadcast
analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``I can't see her working
for Mel. She doesn't need to answer to anyone.'' Still, he added,
``If there is value there, Mel is the one to find it.''
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin could have his eye on King World's full coffers. The
company has almost $1 billion in cash on hand, and CBS could use
the money to buy a television station. CBS and King World would not
comment on the possible talks.
</P>
<P>
   King World was established in 1964 to syndicate films and
television programs to stations nationwide and is currently run by
the founder's sons: Roger King is chairman and Michael King is vice
chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The company originally specialized in reruns, but by the late
1970s it bought rights to distribute game shows like ``The Joker's
Wild'' and ``Tic Tac Dough.'' The company produced its first
in-house show, ``Inside Edition,'' in 1989.

COYOTES HIT JACKPOT  
 REICHEL DOES ALL THEY EXPECTED HIM TO DO _ AND THEN SOME

<P>
   PHOENIX - They thought about Adam Oates from the Washington
Capitals. They considered Theo Fleury from the Calgary Flames. They
were intrigued with Mark Recchi of the Montreal Canadiens. And they
almost zeroed in on his teammate, captain Vincent Damphousse.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came time to pull the trigger on a deal for a
second-line center, the Coyotes got the player they secretly
coveted the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been talking with the Islanders about Robert Reichel
for quite a while,'' General Manager Bobby Smith said. ``He's a
player we think is tremendously gifted. He's got the flair for the
power play that no other player on our team has, that no other
player since this team has been in Arizona has had. Hopefully, it
will mesh with us quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   It has. Smith made those comments less than an hour before
Reichel's debut with the Coyotes on Sunday against the Los Angeles
Kings. On Reichel's first shift, he took a shot that nearly fooled
goalie Jamie Storr and definitely fooled the goal judge, who
prematurely clicked on the red light.
</P>
<P>
   On his third shift, Reichel took a pass behind the net, faked,
and looking the other way, fed Keith Tkachuk right in front for a
1-0 lead. The play drew a rousing standing ovation from the crowd.
Later, Reichel brought them to their feet again, scoring a nifty
empty-net goal on a power play after the Kings pulled Storr for an
extra attacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to like having this guy around,'' Tkachuk
said. ``If he keeps making plays like those, we're going to be all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   He has. They are.
</P>
<P>
   Reichel, whose 60 points (22 goals, 38 assists) rank second on
the team behind Jeremy Roenick and 21st in the NHL, set up another
Tkachuk goal in his next game against Dallas. Then on Thursday, in
a 4-2 win over Washington, the native of Litvinov, Czecholslovakia,
scored twice on a night when he very well could have put in four or
five.
</P>
<P>
   He missed on a third-period penalty shot.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that's three goals and two assists in three games
entering tonight's match-up at 8 against the Calgary Flames at
America West Arena. With another win, the Coyotes (35-25-12) can
wrap up a four-game home stand at 3-1 and reach the 84-point
barrier, the most since they finished with 87 in 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes have 10 regular-season games remaining and have a
shot to threaten the franchise record for most points in a season _
96 in 1984-85 _ but would have to finish strong. If Reichel keeps
working his magic, centering a rejuvenated Greg Adams and Rick
Tocchet, anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very good here,'' said Reichel, 27, who needs one point
to reach the 500 milestone. ``They're giving me a chance to play
with good players and I'm trying my best. So far, things are going
my way, the team is winning and it's coming at a very good time
with the playoffs coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who traded 21-year-old wing Brad Isbister to the
Islanders for Reichel and an exchange of draft picks _ Phoenix also
swapped third-round choices and received a fourth-round pick from
an Islanders deal with Ottawa _ has always been impressed with
Reichel's offensive talents. He's on pace to finish with his best
NHL season since amassing 93 points for Calgary, recording his
second straight 40-goal season, six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch him out there and he can make the pass, find a guy,
find the seam that other guys can't,'' Smith said. ``He can find a
guy in the middle of the box, the other side of the box, take a
shot, find another guy open on the side of the net. He doesn't just
make the basic play.''
</P>
<P>
   Reichel gives the Coyotes and Coach Jim Schoenfeld a different
look they didn't have while trying an assortment of players on the
second line behind Tkachuk, Roenick and Dallas Drake. He creates
scoring chances on almost every shift and is deceptively quick.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an elite hockey player, and we knew exactly what we were
getting,'' Schoenfeld said. ``He's as good as advertised, and I
think he's shown everyone who was wondering what type of player he
is exactly what type he is. He's a great playmaker and has a
tremendous shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Reichel should kick-start the team's sagging power-play unit,
which ranks among th worst in the league. He also should take some
pressure off Roenick's shoulders, according to Tkachuk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be great for JR,'' Tkachuk said.
``Robert's going to push him, but also take a little bit of the
weight off JR. You need two good solid lines and we've got that
now. We've just got to get past the first round of the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   That's something the franchise hasn't accomplished in a dozen
years.

BECK-LEE BAT TLE SPARKS ILL WILL BETWEEN D-BACKS AND CUBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, ARIZ. - When the Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa hit two home
runs against the Diamondbacks on March 17 and bowed after each one,
a bit of bad blood might have oozed between the two clubs after
Arizona pitcher Todd Stottlemyre claimed Sosa was showing him up.
</P>
<P>
   But after what happened Friday when they met again at HoHoKam
Park in Mesa?
</P>
<P>
   Forget about it! The bad blood's not oozing any more: It's
flowing like a river.
</P>
<P>
   As a capacity crowd of 12,423 looked on, both benches and
bullpens emptied when Arizona right-hander Rich Batchelor plunked
Cubs second baseman Mickey Morandini in the back with a pitch.
Morandini moved toward the mound, jawing at Batchelor, and the
clubs exchanged shoves and expletives, but no punches. Diamondbacks
catcher Damian Miller claimed he was kicked in the stomach,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still had my chest protector on but I still felt the
spikes,'' Miller said. ``The guy hid behind two other guys
(teammates). Do I know who he is? Yeah, and he does, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The fuse was lit in the top of the sixth inning when the
Diamondbacks, who rocked Cubs starter Steve Trachsel for 15 runs on
11 hits over the first 2 1/3 innings, started using veteran closer
Rod Beck for target practice.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Steve Finley hit a homer off Beck, his second of
the game, and second baseman Hanley Frias hit a double. Then Beck,
who had not pitched in a game in three weeks due to a disc problem
in his back, hit Diamondacks first baseman Travis Lee on the back
of the right shoulder near the base of the neck. It appeared
initially that Lee had been hit in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, entering his second season, stared at the burly
right-hander before moving toward first base. He said Beck told him
the pitch was not intentional, but his veteran teammates and
Manager Buck Showalter believed otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in the (strike) zone the first few pitches and I took a
big cut at one,'' Lee said. ``Then I saw this one coming in on me
and I thought, `Holy crap.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One of the veteran Diamondbacks, outfielder Luis Gonzalez, slid
hard into Morandini as the Cubs completed a double play to end the
inning and the two exchanged words.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hit our guy, so I was just sliding hard. It was part of
the game,'' said Gonzalez, who played for the Cubs in 1995 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Batchelor pitch in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of got away from me,'' Batchelor said. ``When you let
the ball go and it starts to go in there (toward the hitter), you
have to think that it (batter charging the mound) might happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Order was restored and no one was ejected, but tempers simmered.
Sosa, who had hit his ninth homer of the spring, stepped to the
plate and hit a rocket off Batchelor's left leg, just below the
knee for a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Diamondbacks became livid when they saw Cubs third
baseman-catcher Tyler Houston standing on the top step of the
dugout, clapping as Arizona trainers tended to Batchelor. Finley
had to be restrained. Houston hit a home run later in the inning as
the Cubs scored seven runs, but Arizona held on for a 17-10
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Finley kept his emotions in check afterward, saying, ``That's
not something you want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Batchelor, whose leg was swollen slightly and was due to get a
precautionary X-ray when the team returned to Tucson, said he did
not see Houston, didn't doubt his teammates and said the move
``showed a lack of character. It was tasteless.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the pitch that hit Lee, Beck said, ``I wasn't trying to hit
him. I've got no reason to hit anybody in spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter wasn't buying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the experience he's had throwing on the side, throwing in
the bullpen, it's a little hard to fathom that he would let a pitch
get away like that,'' Showalter said. ``Anybody watching the game
who knows anything about the game knows it was intentional.''
</P>
<P>
   Morandini cautioned reporters: ``Don't interview me, because I
ain't saying nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have to.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Diamondbacks would remember Friday's events when
the clubs meet for the first time during the regular season at Bank
One Ballpark June 7-9, Gonzalez said, ``What do you think?'' &QL;

WILLIAMS DOES HIS POUNDING AT THE PLATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, ARIZ. -  &UR; Matt Williams didn't have to say it. The look on
his face spoke volumes.
</P>
<P>
   A swirl of emotion was rushing through his veins after the
Diamondbacks' 17-10 victory over the Chicago Cubs on Friday at
HoHoKam Park in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to enjoy his first big offensive effort at the plate
this spring, four hits in five trips with seven RBIs, including a
three-run homer, but it was lost amid events surrounding a
bench-clearing incident in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Right in the middle of it was Williams' former San Francisco
Giants teammate and friend, right-hander  &UR; Rod Beck, who hit Arizona
first baseman  &UR; Travis Lee in the shoulder with a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the next batter, hit a hard shot to third baseman
 &UR; Tyler
 &UR; Houston for a forceout. Then in the bottom of the sixth, Williams
was among those pouring onto the field when the Diamondbacks'  &UR; Rich
 &UR; Batchelor hit the Cubs'  &UR; Mickey Morandini.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any comment on that,'' Williams said, teeth
clenched.
</P>
<P>
   He did say that he is encouraged by the way he is starting to
swing the bat with the season opener a little more than a week
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made good contact all five times, even on the out,'' he
said. ``I'm trying to hit the ball hard.'' &QL; 
Short stops &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander  &UR; Gregg Olson threw 18 pitches without discomfort in
his right forearm and wrist during a minor-league intrasquad game
Friday in Tucson and likely will pitch in a similar-type game on
Sunday. Right-hander  &UR; Amaury Telemaco, who has been battling
shoulder tendinitis, also is expected to pitch in the same game on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Diamondbacks' scouts will gather Sunday and Monday
to discuss what they have seen in the Grapefruit and Cactus leagues
this spring and if there are any players that the club should
consider acquiring.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly lost in the offensive display by both clubs on Friday was
a hustling play by  &UR; Steve Finley in center field in the first
inning. With the Cubs'  &UR; Henry Rodriguez at first,  &UR; Scott Stahoviak
hit a ball off the fence in left-center. Finley got over to field
the carom, whirled and threw to the cutoff man to keep Rodriguez
from scoring, holding him at third. Houston then flew out to Finley
to end the inning. &QL;

EDITORIAL: DR. KEVORKIAN'S LUCK RUNS OUT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, March 27: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack Kevorkian sought to have a court of law determine
whether euthanasia, or ``mercy killing,'' is a crime. He got an
answer Friday when a jury convicted him of second-degree murder and
of delivering a controlled substance in the killing of Thomas Youk,
a man suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease. There was no dispute on
the facts. Kevorkian videotaped himself giving Youk a lethal
injection of drugs, and then had the tape broadcast on CBS's ``60
Minutes'' last November.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian had been acquitted of assisted suicide in several
previous cases where desperately ill people flipped a switch on a
``suicide machine'' built by the doctor. But in those cases he did
not directly inject the drugs. This is the first trial involving a
killing by his own hand. He was not allowed to present evidence
about Youk's suffering or his consent to die, since consent is not
a defense to murder. The jury did its duty in finding that the
killing fit the definition of murder. However, the jury did not
find the doctor guilty of first-degree murder, which carries a
mandatory life sentence. The second-degree murder verdict will
allow the judge to impose a sentence less than life.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian's reckless acts show why there need to be ways for
terminally ill patients to seek aggressive palliative care _ and
even assisted suicide in controlled and regulated circumstances. It
is a tragedy that patients like Youk have had to seek the services
of this odd character. But desperation drives them to him.
</P>
<P>
   Most advocates of physician-assisted suicide hold as a first
principle that the patient must be the one in full control. The
Oregon laws that have legalized assisted suicide, for example,
honor that principle. Kevorkian's mercy killing violates it.
Previous juries have let him off the hook for assisting in
suicides. But this jury drew the line at direct killing.

   U.S. and allied forces tore deeper into the heart of the Serb
military machine Friday in a third day of air strikes across
Yugoslavia, as American warplanes shot down two Serb fighter jets
near a base of U.S. troops in neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, thousands of Serb troops backed with tanks
deepened their year-long campaign of terror, attacking villages and
ravaging homes amid unconfirmed reports of round-ups and summary
killings of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Across the region, anti-American violence swept as far away at
Greece, where an estimated 10,000 protesters marched on the U.S.
Embassy in Athens, hurling stones and bricks until they were
dispersed by riot police firing water cannons.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration found itself waging a
global campaign for public support for continuing the assault, even
as the Pentagon hunkered down for what could be a prolonged air war
on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin voiced outrage over the
escalating violence against ethnic Albanians, citing ''ominous''
reports of widening atrocities and warning that perpetrators would
be regarded as war criminals subject to trial and punishment once
the crisis ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are increasing reports of atrocities against Albanian
civilians in Kosovo,'' Rubin said. ``We are extremely alarmed by
these reports, and we are putting a great deal of resources and
effort into checking these out, as quickly as we can and as
thoroughly as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the unconfirmed reports the administration was looking
into were allegations by large numbers of refugees fleeing Kosovo
that up to 20,000 ethnic Albanians had been put on a forced march
by Serb troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking into it as best we can through the various means
that we have,'' said National Security Council spokesman P.J.
Crowley. ``I don't think that we are in a position to confirm any
details, but we are definitely checking into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Yugoslavia's Foreign Minister, Zivadin
Jovanovic, went on the CNN television network to decry the reports
of atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethnic Albanians (in the Serbian province of Kosovo) are
Yugoslav citizens,'' Jovanovic insisted. ``They enjoy equal rights,
equal opportunities, but terrorists have to be neutralized.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade claims that its military campaign in Kosovo has been
necessary to combat rebel groups of Kosovar Albanians pressing for
independence for the province of 2.2 million people, 90 percent of
whom are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin cited reports that Serb forces executed 20 ethnic
Albanians in the village of Goden on Thursday. The alleged killings
were reported by refugees from the region to the United Nations
High Commission on Refugees, which is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate incident, Albanian human rights lawyer Bayram
Keljmendi and his two sons were allegedly taken from their home
early Friday in the Kosovo provincial capital of Pristina, beaten
in front of their family and taken off and executed by Serbian
troops, according to reports verified by the New York-based Lawyers
Committee for Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Keljmendi had represented the Koha Ditore, one of the largest
Albanian newspapers. The three men's bodies were found at a gas
station outside of Pristina, according to
</P>
<P>
   the Humanitarian Law Center, an independent human rights
monitoring organization
</P>
<P>
   in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, the press agency for the separatist rebels, the
Kosovo Liberation Army, reported that 20 Albanians had been killed
in a mass execution in the town of Orahovac, and another 10 in the
town of Podujevo. The reports could not be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The International Crisis Group, a private private humanitarian
organization in Washington that has closely monitored the Kosovo
crisis, reported that the warehouse for the Mother Theresa Society,
one of the largest local humanitarian organizations, was burned to
the ground near Pristina on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the starkest testimony to the terror has been the number
of ethnic Albanians -- 365,000 as of Friday -- who have fled their
homes, most with only those belongings they could carry, to escape
the onslaught of Serb troops and thugs.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the horror, NATO officials in Brussels reported Friday
that 300 hardened Serb criminals have been released in recent days
and added to the ranks of the rampaging patrols in Kosovo, a
reprise of a tactic Serbs unleashed to brutal effect in their 3
1/2-year war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said it would step up its satellite surveillance of
Kosovo by flying unmanned drone aircraft into the region to monitor
by low altitude camera what can no longer be witnessed firsthand in
a province where international monitors, journalists and aid
workers have been forced to flee.
</P>
<P>
   To date, NATO attacks have focused on Serb air defenses, early
warning radar sites, fuel and ammunition dumps, power stations and
command and control systems.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks began around 9 p.m. local time Friday in Yugoslavia,
with news reports of explosions in at least 11 suburbs ringing the
capital of Belgrade, where air sirens blared and a city-wide
blackout was imposed for a third straight night.
</P>
<P>
   While hitting at the headquarters and supply centers of the Serb
army, police and special forces believed responsible for the bulk
of the Kosovo oppression, the U.S. Air Force has refrained from
using its extensive capabilities for pursuing tanks and troops in
the fields and on the roads of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That could change in the days ahead, however, Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon told reporters in Washington, as the NATO strikes
continued to weaken Serb air defenses, reducing the dangers to NATO
pilots flying missions directly targeting Serb forces in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``As these strikes continue over the following days, we will, as
appropriate, increase the concentration and focus on targets within
Kosovo itself,'' said Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials insisted, however, that the Serbs' ongoing
attacks on civilians are an extension of the very Serb repression
that has prompted the NATO strikes and should not be regarded as
retaliation for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be somehow quite perverse to put the cart before the
horse and somehow conclude that it's NATO action which has given
President Milosevic a pretext to crack down,'' NATO spokesman Jamie
Shea told reporters at alliance headquarters in Brussels. ``He's
been cracking down without any pretext at all for the best part of
a year. We are intervening to stop that from happening, and to stop
it once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic is the president of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it vowed to ratchet up air attacks directly on the Serb
forces conducting the repression in Kosovo, though, the Pentagon
got a bone-rattling reminder of the perils of continued conflict in
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Yugoslav MiG-29 fighter jets managed to get within 25
miles of Tuzla, base for the 6,900 U.S. troops taking part in the
NATO peacekeeping operation in Bosnia, before being shot down by
two American F-15 fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb aircraft were spotted by a U.S. AWACS airplane flying
surveillance over the region, Bacon said. The AWACS alerted the
F-15 pilots, who were flying combat air patrols in the area and
quickly intercepted and destroyed the MiGs.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Friday, NATO patrols were searching for the Serb
pilots and the wreckage of the aircraft. Bacon said the MiGs'
mission remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts speculated, however, that Milosevic might have
hoped to slip past the NATO air defenses to stage a surprise attack
on the U.S. troops, stationed not far from where the MiGs were shot
down near the town of Teocak.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Mach 1, that's about 10 seconds from the Tuzla air base,''
said Balkans expert Bill Stuebner of the U.S. Institute for Peace,
a quasi-governmental think tank in Washington, D.C. ``Milosevic
must have decided to take a chance and send home body bags to the
United States to see how that would affect the dynamic here at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   His reference was to polls showing thin domestic support for
U.S.-led NATO strikes in Yugoslavia, a mission over which the
public is divided in a roughly even split.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to build public backing for his policy, President Clinton
planned to devote his Saturday radio address to the Kosovo crisis,
an issue he addressed the nation on when the air strikes began on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to reiterate his resolve to wage a long-term
air campaign against Serb military forces, unless Milosevic agrees
to an international peace plan for Kosovo.

EDITORIAL: SHOW US THE MONEY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, March 27: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the possible casualties of the furious budget bargaining
in Albany is Gov. George Pataki's request for $28 million in new
money to begin construction of the Hudson River Park along
Manhattan's West Side. The Republican-controlled Senate knocked the
appropriation out of its budget bill, in part because Pataki has
spent only $4 million of $20 million approved last year, leaving a
$16 million carryover. The Democrats in the Assembly approved $21
million of the $28 million request. When the governor and the
legislative leaders sit down to discuss differences, Pataki must
insist, at the very least, on the Assembly's more generous figure.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans argue that it makes no sense to tie up another
chunk of money in the park when there are more immediate needs.
They say they will relent if Pataki quickly produces a detailed
plan on how the money will be spent. That is an unrealistic
request. The governing board that will run the project _ and hence
has the authority to spend money _ was appointed only last month.
Even so, it is important to have the money on hand.
</P>
<P>
   The board inherits a solid general plan that calls for replacing
the rotting piers on Manhattan's West Side with an inviting mix of
open space and commercial development. The engineers cannot be
expected to finish the design work and let construction contracts
on the basis of political promises.
</P>
<P>
   The citizens' coalition supporting the park required 13 years to
develop a plan on which rival politicians and competing interest
groups could broadly agree, and another year on top of that to win
legislative approval. The political will is now in place to move
this project forward. The economy is robust.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is fully on board and has
pledged $100 million from his capital budget over the next four
years. The Legislature should deliver on its part of the deal.

DUKE RUNS TO TITLE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ The Duke women's basketball team looks like dough and
plays like money.
</P>
<P>
   Except for 6-foot-6 All-America Michele VanGorp, the Blue Devils
are as unathletic looking a national finalist as can be imagined.
Yet they not only humbled the Three Meeks in ousting three-time
defending NCAA champion Tennessee but by downing Georiga, 81-69,
Friday night at San Jose Arena are a step away from a title in
their first Final Four appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be athletic to be a great player,'' Duke
Coach Gail Goestenkors said. ``We're very smart. If someone has got
a weakness, we take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia weakness was an inability to cover both VanGorp
inside and the perimeter sharpshooters Nicole Erickson, Georgia
Schweitzer and Hilary Howard. VanGorp ran up 20 points while
Erickson had a game-high 22 as the Devils shot 56.3 percent from
3-point.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spread you offensively because they can,'' Georgia Coach
Andy Landers said. ``You find yourself yo-yoing from a very
talented post player to very talented shooters. It's almost as if
you choose your poison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of those players are pretty damn good players.''
</P>
<P>
   The best player for either side in the first half was Georgia
backup guard Deana Nolan, who eight points in 12 minutes exceeded
her season average by one. Her athleticism stabilized the Bulldogs,
down 17-7 after the opening 5:11 off a 12-2 Duke run.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan had two buckets in a 12-3 run that brought Georgia within
one, 20-19, just past the middle of the first half. The Bulldogs
scored eight straight points to lead, 27-25, for the first time
since a game-opening 3-pointer by Coco Miller.
</P>
<P>
   But VanGorp and Howard took control in the final 3:34 of the
first half and opening 1:29 of the second. They scored all but two
of Duke's points in a 16-5 run that turned a tie at 31 into the
beginning of a runaway, 47-36.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia (27-7) fought back within 60-54 with 9:10 remaining then
a pair of free throws each by Howard, Erickson and VanGorp put Duke
(29-6) safely ahead 66-54 and started a game-clinching 16-3 run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played with tremendous poise,'' Goestenkors said. ``We
played with confidence and also very relaxed, with a championship
mentality that we've showed all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia guard Coco and Kelly Miller combined for 31 points,
within range of the twins' season average of 37, but Kelly was
limited by Howard to 13, 20 fewer than she scored in the Mideast
Region final.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer initially covered Coco Miller until Erickson took
over the job, a switch that kept Georgia's transition game in
check.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to run when we score and take care of the ball,''
Goestenkors said.
</P>
<P>
   Young Georgia, with just one senior starter, exits its fifth
Final Four still seeking the brass ring. Duke, at least until later
today, is one step ahead of its powerhouse men in the school's
pursuit of the first ever sweep of NCAA titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know our limitations,'' said the 5-6 Howard, who had five
of her eight points in the late first/early second-half run and two
particularly pretty assists. ``We know we're undersized, that we're
not the quickest players or the most athletic on the court. Our
biggest thing is team.''

O'BRIEN HAS REVIVED BUCKEYES IN A HURRY  
 COACH SEEKS END TO CALHOUN JINX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Anticipation and preparation are part of
the reason Ohio State Coach Jim O'Brien and his three counterparts
are here at the Final Four. So not only was O'Brien ready for the
question he knew would come, he launched a pre-emptive strike
against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to share a funny story with you,'' he told the media on
Friday. ``I know somebody is going to ask about 18 straight losses
to Jim Calhoun. We might as well talk about it right this minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Might as well, Jim. Ever since Ohio State beat St. John's in the
South Region final last Saturday to set up a date with Connecticut
today at Tropicana Field in the opening national semifinal game, a
hot topic has been the 18 straight times Calhoun and UConn beat
O'Brien's Boston College teams between 1989 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, O'Brien said, the four coaches _ he, Calhoun, Duke's
Mike Krzyzewski and Michigan State's Tom Izzo _ were together the
night before. Calhoun, ``obviously a wonderful guy,'' according to
O'Brien, said to Krzyzewski, ``It's nice to see you,'' and he said
to Izzo, ``It's nice to see you,'' and what do you think he said to
O'Brien?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim, it's ``really'' nice to see you.''
</P>
<P>
   Rim shot, please.
</P>
<P>
   That was funny, but the truth is this: Boston College is old
news. O'Brien last coached there during the 1996-97 season, before
a bitter dispute with his alma mater's administration left him no
recourse but to leave. Ohio State was glad to take him.
</P>
<P>
   There are few reminders in O'Brien's office of his Boston
College days, one of them being a Big East Coach of the Year
trophy. It's a new team for O'Brien, a new chapter in his life.
Calhoun knows this, which is why he said of the streak, ``The
relevancy of it here is non-existent.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun's teams always seemed to be a little bit better than
O'Brien's. When Boston College was good, UConn was very good. When
Boston College was very good, UConn was great. This time, in this
setting, Calhoun's Huskies may be a tad better than O'Brien's
Buckeyes. Maybe not. Even if they are, the better team doesn't
always win.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it comes down to which team handles the moment the
best. There seems to be little O'Brien and his team can't handle.
This is a guy whose love for his wife, Christine, was the one, true
thing in his life, and then Christine died suddenly of a heart
attack in 1991, leaving O'Brien to raise two daughters by himself.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Erin, now 24, recently told a reporter, ``We all
sort of fumbled our way through it at first. We weren't the perfect
daughters, and he couldn't be the perfect father. . . . It could
have been terrible. It could have torn us apart. But Dad was
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   After rebuilding a family, how tough is it to rebuild a
basketball program?
</P>
<P>
   Under Randy Ayers, whose descent from national Coach of the Year
to former coach was shocking in its rapidity, Ohio State was 39-72
in the four seasons preceding O'Brien. Last season, O'Brien's
first, the Buckeyes were 8-22 and 1-15 in their conference, 11th in
the Big Ten. There might be a joke in that, but it wasn't very
funny back in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   But there was hope. O'Brien's power of persuasion had enticed a
kid named Michael Redd, from just down the street at Columbus West
High School, to stay in town. And O'Brien's ability to lead,
combined with fears of bad days ahead at Boston College, prompted a
tough, mature point guard named James ``Scoonie'' Penn to transfer
along with O'Brien to Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Redd, a 6-foot-6 sophomore guard who can shoot the
three-pointer, take it to the basket and create the shot of his
choice, led the Big Ten in scoring as a freshman last season, even
though, O'Brien said, ``We created a little bit of a monster with
Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaning?
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a real hard time scoring points a year ago, and Michael
got away with murder because he was allowed to take a lot of shots,
a lot of poor shots,'' said O'Brien, whose first college coaching
job was as an assistant at UConn in 1977. ``We talked to him about
the need for him to score a bundle of points.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, O'Brien said, ``It's all changed.''
</P>
<P>
   It's changed because of Penn, the Most Valuable Player of the
1997 Big East Tournament. Penn, whose original nickname, ``Uno''
(for No. 1 son), morphed into ``Scoonie,'' has lightened much of
Redd's scoring load and has set Redd up for better shots.
Meanwhile, Penn has proven to be a force of his own.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-10 junior, Penn can score and pass and basically do whatever
you'd like your point guard to do. He and Redd form perhaps college
basketball's most dynamic backcourt. Not to minimize the roles of
center Ken Johnson, forward Jason Singleton and the others, or what
O'Brien adds to the mix (Calhoun calls him ``as efficient an
offensive coach as anybody in America''), but it has primarily been
the Penn-Redd duo that has brought the Buckeyes to a very special
place.
</P>
<P>
   They have related especially well during the NCAA Tournament.
They have scored more than half of the Buckeyes' points.
</P>
<P>
   It sets up an interesting dilemma for Calhoun, whose Huskies
play exceptional defense partly because UConn guard Ricky Moore has
been known to effectively remove the opponent's best offensive
player from the game. Whom does the 6-2 Moore defend, Penn or Redd?
Logic dictates Penn, but what happens if Redd gets hot?
</P>
<P>
   ``If he covers me or if he covers Mike,'' Penn said, ``he's
gonna have to work.'' &QL;

SPARTANS NOT ALONE IN BELIEF THAT UPSET OVER DUKE IS POSSIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Michigan State lost to Duke by just six
points during the Great Eight Tournament in Chicago in December,
and the Spartans think they can pull off one of the greatest upsets
in college basketball history against the Blue Devils tonight in
the national semifinals at Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have much company, however. Duke is a prohibitive
favorite. But a firm believer in Michigan State's chances is Ohio
State Coach  &UR; Jim O'Brien, who lost to the Spartans, 76-71, in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Michigan State is a real good opponent for Duke,''
O'Brien said. ``The thing that makes them special is their
toughness. . . . I think you have to be a physically and mentally
tough team to be able to play a team like Duke.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien's players concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why people are wigging out,'' guard  &UR; Michael Redd
said. ``They're (Michigan State) a great team.  &UR; Mateen Cleaves is a
great leader.'' &QL; 
Rebounding &QL; 
Despite losing, Michigan State outrebounded Duke, 41-25.  &UR; Elton
Brand, the Blue Devils' 6-foot-8, 260-pound All-America sophomore
center, scored 12 points but grabbed just three rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that was because of the Spartans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've rebounded about 50 percent of their missed shots in
the tournament,'' Brand said. ``That's an outrageous stat. They're
just relentless on the boards.'' &QL; 
Playing footsy &QL; 
Duke's other All-American, senior guard  &UR; Trajan Langdon, doesn't
seem to have many worries. But he was more than a little concerned
when a strained left foot caused him to miss three games, including
the Blue Devils' NCAA Tournament opener against Florida A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very scared,'' he said. ``I didn't really know how to
react, how quick I would recover. . . . But I stayed positive and
did what the trainers and doctors told me to do. I'm fortunate to
be back here.'' &QL; 
Age differential &QL; 
Somebody asked Connecticut Coach  &UR; Jim Calhoun about his
conversations with his flaky sophomore point guard,  &UR; Khalid
El-Amin. Calhoun has said that talking with El-Amin was like
talking to a 35-year-old. But Calhoun wanted to clarify that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It varies between 35 and 15,'' Calhoun said. ``Fifteen we all
understand. . . . The 35, he just seems to have things in
perspective better than most people that I've ever been around.'' &QL;

 MINDING YOUR TRADING P's AND Q's   (Eds: This is a sidebar with INVEST-ELECTRONIC-NETWORKS)  
 (af)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As more investors flock to trade stocks on line, the
frustrations are likely to increase. While commissions are lower
than ever, poor executions of trades can make online investing
expensive indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some do's and don'ts for online trade:
</P>
<P>
   Under only one circumstance should you place a market order for
a NASDAQ stock online _ when you absolutely must get out.
</P>
<P>
   In wildly fluctuating NASDAQ stocks, such orders to buy or sell
the stock in question regardless of price are a good way to overpay
for a stock or receive too little when selling. Indeed, Kenneth
Pasternak, president of Knight/Trimark Group, parent of Knight
Securities, one of the nation's largest market-making firms, wants
to outlaw market orders. He thinks that too many investors buy
stocks with no regard to price.
</P>
<P>
   _ Instead, investors should use limit orders, which specify a
certain price to buy or sell shares.
</P>
<P>
   But what price? Market insiders say that you are unlikely to
have either buy or sell orders filled at the price on your trading
screen at any moment; the market simply moves too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Finn, former economist at both the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers,
advises traders to place limit orders at prices that are between
the currently quoted bid and the offered prices. That enhances the
odds that your order will be filled.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you think that you did not get the best price on a trade,
ask your broker for a record of trades that were executed at the
time you placed your order. This is called a ``time and sales,''
and it should reveal whether other orders were given priority over
yours. Or it could show that your trade was far afield of prices at
the time you placed it.
</P>
<P>
   Some brokers may not be willing to provide this information or
walk an investor through it. The NASD Regulation's Web site,
www.nasdr.com, has a complaint form you can fill out.
</P>
<P>
   Or you may want to pay for help.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Mazzeo, a former professional trader, has set up the
Electronic Traders Assistance Association, a for-profit
organization that will research five disputed trades for $200. The
association's Web site is www.etaa.com.

   U.S. and allied forces tore deeper into the heart of the Serb
military machine Friday in a third day of air strikes across
Yugoslavia, as American warplanes shot down two Serb fighter jets
near a base of U.S. troops in neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, thousands of Serb troops backed with tanks
deepened their year-long campaign of terror, attacking villages and
ravaging homes amid unconfirmed reports of round-ups and summary
killings of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Across the region, anti-American violence swept as far away at
Greece, where an estimated 10,000 protesters marched on the U.S.
Embassy in Athens, hurling stones and bricks until they were
dispersed by riot police firing water cannons.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration found itself waging a
global campaign for public support for continuing the assault, even
as the Pentagon hunkered down for what could be a prolonged air war
on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin voiced outrage over the
escalating violence against ethnic Albanians, citing ''ominous''
reports of widening atrocities and warning that perpetrators would
be regarded as war criminals subject to trial and punishment once
the crisis ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are increasing reports of atrocities against Albanian
civilians in Kosovo,'' Rubin said. ``We are extremely alarmed by
these reports, and we are putting a great deal of resources and
effort into checking these out, as quickly as we can and as
thoroughly as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the unconfirmed reports the administration was looking
into were allegations by large numbers of refugees fleeing Kosovo
that up to 20,000 ethnic Albanians had been put on a forced march
by Serb troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking into it as best we can through the various means
that we have,'' said National Security Council spokesman P.J.
Crowley. ``I don't think that we are in a position to confirm any
details, but we are definitely checking into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Yugoslavia's Foreign Minister, Zivadin
Jovanovic, went on the CNN television network to decry the reports
of atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethnic Albanians (in the Serbian province of Kosovo) are
Yugoslav citizens,'' Jovanovic insisted. ``They enjoy equal rights,
equal opportunities, but terrorists have to be neutralized.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade claims that its military campaign in Kosovo has been
necessary to combat rebel groups of Kosovar Albanians pressing for
independence for the province of 2.2 million people, 90 percent of
whom are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin cited reports that Serb forces executed 20 ethnic
Albanians in the village of Goden on Thursday. The alleged killings
were reported by refugees from the region to the United Nations
High Commission on Refugees, which is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate incident, Albanian human rights lawyer Bayram
Keljmendi and his two sons were allegedly taken from their home
early Friday in the Kosovo provincial capital of Pristina, beaten
in front of their family and taken off and executed by Serbian
troops, according to reports verified by the New York-based Lawyers
Committee for Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Keljmendi had represented the Koha Ditore, one of the largest
Albanian newspapers. The three men's bodies were found at a gas
station outside of Pristina, according to
</P>
<P>
   the Humanitarian Law Center, an independent human rights
monitoring organization
</P>
<P>
   in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, the press agency for the separatist rebels, the
Kosovo Liberation Army, reported that 20 Albanians had been killed
in a mass execution in the town of Orahovac, and another 10 in the
town of Podujevo. The reports could not be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The International Crisis Group, a private private humanitarian
organization in Washington that has closely monitored the Kosovo
crisis, reported that the warehouse for the Mother Theresa Society,
one of the largest local humanitarian organizations, was burned to
the ground near Pristina on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the starkest testimony to the terror has been the number
of ethnic Albanians -- 365,000 as of Friday -- who have fled their
homes, most with only those belongings they could carry, to escape
the onslaught of Serb troops and thugs.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the horror, NATO officials in Brussels reported Friday
that 300 hardened Serb criminals have been released in recent days
and added to the ranks of the rampaging patrols in Kosovo, a
reprise of a tactic Serbs unleashed to brutal effect in their 3
1/2-year war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said it would step up its satellite surveillance of
Kosovo by flying unmanned drone aircraft into the region to monitor
by low altitude camera what can no longer be witnessed firsthand in
a province where international monitors, journalists and aid
workers have been forced to flee.
</P>
<P>
   To date, NATO attacks have focused on Serb air defenses, early
warning radar sites, fuel and ammunition dumps, power stations and
command and control systems.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks began around 9 p.m. local time Friday in Yugoslavia,
with news reports of explosions in at least 11 suburbs ringing the
capital of Belgrade, where air sirens blared and a city-wide
blackout was imposed for a third straight night.
</P>
<P>
   While hitting at the headquarters and supply centers of the Serb
army, police and special forces believed responsible for the bulk
of the Kosovo oppression, the U.S. Air Force has refrained from
using its extensive capabilities for pursuing tanks and troops in
the fields and on the roads of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That could change in the days ahead, however, Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon told reporters in Washington, as the NATO strikes
continued to weaken Serb air defenses, reducing the dangers to NATO
pilots flying missions directly targeting Serb forces in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``As these strikes continue over the following days, we will, as
appropriate, increase the concentration and focus on targets within
Kosovo itself,'' said Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials insisted, however, that the Serbs' ongoing
attacks on civilians are an extension of the very Serb repression
that has prompted the NATO strikes and should not be regarded as
retaliation for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be somehow quite perverse to put the cart before the
horse and somehow conclude that it's NATO action which has given
President Milosevic a pretext to crack down,'' NATO spokesman Jamie
Shea told reporters at alliance headquarters in Brussels. ``He's
been cracking down without any pretext at all for the best part of
a year. We are intervening to stop that from happening, and to stop
it once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic is the president of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it vowed to ratchet up air attacks directly on the Serb
forces conducting the repression in Kosovo, though, the Pentagon
got a bone-rattling reminder of the perils of continued conflict in
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Yugoslav MiG-29 fighter jets managed to get within 25
miles of Tuzla, base for the 6,900 U.S. troops taking part in the
NATO peacekeeping operation in Bosnia, before being shot down by
two American F-15 fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb aircraft were spotted by a U.S. AWACS airplane flying
surveillance over the region, Bacon said. The AWACS alerted the
F-15 pilots, who were flying combat air patrols in the area and
quickly intercepted and destroyed the MiGs.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Friday, NATO patrols were searching for the Serb
pilots and the wreckage of the aircraft. Bacon said the MiGs'
mission remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts speculated, however, that Milosevic might have
hoped to slip past the NATO air defenses to stage a surprise attack
on the U.S. troops, stationed not far from where the MiGs were shot
down near the town of Teocak.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Mach 1, that's about 10 seconds from the Tuzla air base,''
said Balkans expert Bill Stuebner of the U.S. Institute for Peace,
a quasi-governmental think tank in Washington, D.C. ``Milosevic
must have decided to take a chance and send home body bags to the
United States to see how that would affect the dynamic here at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   His reference was to polls showing thin domestic support for
U.S.-led NATO strikes in Yugoslavia, a mission over which the
public is divided in a roughly even split.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to build public backing for his policy, President Clinton
planned to devote his Saturday radio address to the Kosovo crisis,
an issue he addressed the nation on when the air strikes began on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to reiterate his resolve to wage a long-term
air campaign against Serb military forces, unless Milosevic agrees
to an international peace plan for Kosovo.

EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK: IT'S GREAT BEISBOL, BUT DIPLOMACY LITE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TINA ROSENBERG   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fans of the Baltimore Orioles (79-83 last season) have learned
not to expect too much, and that is good advice for those looking
for political fallout from the Orioles' baseball game Sunday
against a Cuban all-star team in Havana. The Orioles are the latest
American athletes to be pressed into service as diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   But the game, part of a modest package of measures to expand
American contact with ordinary Cubans, is likely to give only a
slight boost to relations between Washington and Havana. Sports
diplomacy has produced dramatic breakthroughs only when the
governments using it were looking for one.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic was the 1971 initiative that came to be known
as pingpong diplomacy. After 20 years with no contacts between
China and the United States, Prime Minister Zhou Enlai invited the
U.S. table tennis team to visit China on its way home from the
world championships in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 players and three reporters who went to Beijing probably
represented more American visitors than had set foot in China since
1950. The Americans said afterward that their hosts, obviously
superior players, let them win many of the games. Three months
after the matches the national security adviser, Henry Kissinger,
made a secret visit to arrange President Nixon's triumphal trip the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly the low point of sports diplomacy came in 1987, when
Heinz Weifenbach, the owner of a cash-strapped ice hockey team in
the West German town of Iserlohn, made a deal with Moammar Gadhafi.
In exchange for the promise of $900,000 from the Libyan leader, the
Iserlohn players wore jerseys advertising the ``Green Book,'' a
compilation of Gadhafi's wisdom. The book was a best seller in
Libya, needless to say, but to Gadhafi's frustration had enjoyed
only limited readership elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's ice hockey federation and local politicians quickly
halted the arrangement, in part because the year before Libya had
orchestrated the bombing of a West Berlin nightclub frequented by
American soldiers, killing three people and injuring hundreds.
Although Weifenbach compared the sponsorship deal to Ping-Pong
diplomacy, it seems to have failed to improve German-Libyan
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there has been a spate of sports diplomacy lite. In
1991 North and South Korea, bitter enemies, fielded a joint table
tennis team at the world championships in Japan. Last year the
Stars and Stripes flew in Tehran as five American wrestlers
competed, to warm applause. A month before, Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami had proposed a program of cultural exchanges with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles' trip _ and a return engagement that the Cuban team
will play in Baltimore in May _ will most likely have a similarly
modest effect. Along with authorizing the baseball games, the
Clinton administration in January approved other cultural exchanges
and allowed Americans to increase the amount of money they can send
Cubans. But wary of alienating right-wing Cubans and their
supporters, the administration did not lift the economic embargo on
Cuba or approve the bipartisan commission many senators had backed
to re-examine Cuba policy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Orioles' trip will open the door to other
high-profile exchanges _ and, perhaps, to better baseball. George
Steinbrenner has been invited to Cuba to talk about a visit by the
Yankees.  &QL;

COLLEGE BASKETBALL HAS THE NBA BEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's edition of The Sporting Muse, which remains devilish
despite tremendous respect for guys named Mateen, Khalid and
Scoonie:
</P>
<P>
   Besides the money, and there will always be the money, what
separates and raises college basketball over the NBA is the
opportunity for guys like Scoonie Penn, all 5-10 of him, to
dominate.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I see NBA teams stuff a court with 3,000 pounds of
manhood and let the ponderous take over the game, my ardor for
college basketball grows stronger. The NBA is the league in
greatest need of an enema.
</P>
<P>
   College basketball just needs better PR, the kind it will
display to the nation today. It's perplexing that more hoop fans
don't favor the collegians. Maybe now with Michael Jordan gone,
fans will begin to drift back to the younger set.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. Today in St. Pete, Scoonie Penn (Ohio State), Mateen
Cleaves (Michigan State), the rotund Khalid El-Amin (UConn) and
William Avery (Duke) are the men most likely to be the key a NCAA
title, and that is said with all the respect in the world for their
bigger and better known teammates.
</P>
<P>
   UConn-Ohio State might turn out to be the best game of the
weekend, if only because it's the only one that won't include
odds-on favorite Duke. The Buckeyes passed a lot of stiff tests to
get here, and Penn will not be fazed in the slightest by El-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   The thought here is that UConn has yet to play its best game yet
in this tournament, and that it may be due. When Jim Calhoun's team
is on, its running game can obliterate any opponent, even one as
good as OSU.
</P>
<P>
   The other game has the potential to be the best of the
tournament, if Michigan State can stay with Duke and avoid any of
their patented 12-0 runs. When the two teams met earlier this year,
Duke jumped out to a 17-2 lead. Michigan State rallied but lost by
six, and Cleaves finished with an unmemorable 3-for-15 night.
</P>
<P>
   If the Spartans, who have exceptional depth and are solid
defensively, can avoid repeating both experiences, they can stay
with Duke and make it a game in the final five minutes. The one
thing Duke hasn't had to deal with this season is close games. ...
</P>
<P>
   In other words, UConn by 10 and Duke by two in a classic. ...
</P>
<P>
   Duke's William Avery has usually been the last point guard
mentioned in discussions of the four in St. Pete. The other points
are better known, and so are Avery's teammates.
</P>
<P>
   But Avery shot 49 percent this season, the best of the quartet,
and he averages 15 points a game and has a 2-to-1 ratio of assists
to turnovers. ...
</P>
<P>
   If Duke stumbles, the burden may fall on the relative youth of
the team. Six of the top eight players are freshmen or sophomores.
If Duke wins it all, then the burden falls on UCLA, which has the
same kind of youth but was cashiered in the first round. ...
</P>
<P>
   Billy Packer is an excellent basketball analyst. But he can
drive you crazy with some of his predilections.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he put together a 64-team dream tourney comprised
of 60 past NCAA champs and four at-large teams as part of an
advertising package in Sports Illustrated, and has played mythical
games between them in search of a Final Four and all-time national
champ.
</P>
<P>
   In getting to the round of 16 in the March 22 issue, he didn't
show too much cronyism to his beloved ACC. Only three of his Sweet
16 teams are from the ACC. But he somehow had the 1962 Cincinnati
team knocking off unbeaten UCLA teams (1964 and 1967) back-to-back.
</P>
<P>
   He also shows his age by heavily favoring older teams. Only four
teams in his Sweet 16 come from the 1980s or 1990s. ...
</P>
<P>
   Small world department: Duke's Trajan Langdon was a high school
classmate of pop singer Jewel. The fact they're both from Alaska
makes it a real, teeny, tiny world, too. ...
</P>
<P>
   San Diego State should consider itself lucky to get a coach as
good as Steve Fisher, who took three Michigan teams to the Final
Four. Now all Fisher has to do is find a new Fab Five somewhere
between Carlsbad and Otay Mesa. ...
</P>
<P>
   Would it be gloating to tell you I had Gonzaga in my office
draft pool? Only if I didn't tell you I also hads North Carolina
and UCLA. ...
</P>
<P>
   Know why the Dodgers gave Kevin Brown $107 million? Because they
factored in all the times Brown will have to relay Todd Hundley's
throws to second base.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball Prospectus 1999 projects Hundley will hit .246 this
season with 19 home runs and 50 RBI. Please note that Charles
Johnson, much-maligned last year as a hitter in the shadow of Mike
Piazza, hit .227 with 14 homers and 38 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The same magazine projects Johnson to hit .236 with 21 homers
and 58 RBI with the Orioles this season. As bad as the Mike Piazza
decision was, the Johnson-for-Hundley exchanges may be an all-time
stinker. ...
</P>
<P>
   I can't remember a pitcher whose decline was as predictable as
Hideo Nomo's, who was just waived by the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he was 13-6 for the Dodgers, with a 2.54 ERA and 236
K's and only 124 hits in 191 innings. But his ratios all started to
turn in the wrong direction a year later. The number of walks and
hits allowed per outing increased while his ERA ballooned. He ended
last year by averaging almost six walks every nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   His slider still has bite, but his fastball is now below average
and his control all over the map. That said, it wouldn't hurt the
Angels to scout him, since the A.L. hasn't seen that much of him.
Maybe he could fool them for another 150 innings. ...
</P>
<P>
   Let's see here, Major League Baseball makes its first trip to
Cuba in 40 years, and it includes the Baltimore Orioles' Albert
Belle as one of its ambassadors?
</P>
<P>
   If I'm Bill Clinton, I keep those nuclear firing codes real
close this weekend. ...

SPRAGUE WINS 4TH PIR POLE  
 RECORD LAP A SURPRISE TO TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Jack Sprague won another NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series
pole position Friday at Phoenix International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Ho-hum.
</P>
<P>
   For Sprague, it was his 13th career pole and fourth at PIR,
where he also has won three times.
</P>
<P>
   But for the life of Sprague, he can't figure out how he did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our practices were terrible,'' Sprague said. ``We're still
trying to find the balance with the new (GMAC Financial Services
Chevy Silverado) truck. We're just going through a learning
curve.''
</P>
<P>
   Some curve.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sprague crashed in the season-opener last week and
finished 22nd, he was a pole cat at PIR, setting a new 1-mile
qualifying record with a speed of 128.402 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Crawford, who earlier had snapped the qualifying mark with
a 128.105 mph lap, will start next to Sprague on the front row.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Sprague) cheated,'' Crawford mused.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Harvick, Greg Biffle and Ron Hornaday Jr. complete the top
five.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wallace, last week's winner, starts seventh in today's
Chevy Trucks 150.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague was as surprised as anyone to make it atop the
qualifying ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We struggled last week,' Sprague said. ``And we went through
three different setups here. I said, `Let's just change the whole
thing again (before the end of practice).'
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea we'd be this good. We changed the springs,
shocks, sway bar. I don't know what to say. It shouldn't have
happened, but he (crew chief Dennis Connor) hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what usually happens with champions, right? Sprague won
the series crown two years ago and twice has finished runner-up to
Hornaday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to pick, this would be my favorite racetrack,''
Sprague said. ``This is the place we won our first race.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprague has won 12 since that first truck victory, including two
at PIR when he started from the pole.
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack's been good here,'' Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Crawford hasn't won at PIR, he at least has put his
best foot forward in qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't let any grass grow underneath (the truck),'' Crawford
said. ``I drove it into the corners, and it worked really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Sprague, Harvick also was somewhat surprised with his
starting position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've actually been concentrating on our race setup,'' Harvick
said. ``This was just an added bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Although disappointed with a fourth-row start, Wallace made up
for it in NASCAR Winston West qualifying for today's NAPA Parts
100.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace outdueled Steve Portenga for the pole, unloading a
record fast lap clocked at 129.296 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Portenga checked in at 128.365 mph, which was slightly better
than Hornaday (128.100 mph).
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have taken some of my frustration out after the truck
qualifying,'' said Wallace, younger brother of Rusty Wallace. ``I
thought I had a pole truck there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been really focused on the truck, but we're going to run
four Winston West races, trying to prepare to run four (Winston)
Cup races later in the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock car, Wallace said, was purchased from Kranefuss-Haas
Racing, whose Winston Cup driver is John Andretti. Robert Yates
Racing prepared the motor.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Thompson of Phoenix, who finished sixth last season in the
NTB Trans-Am circuit, qualified a respectable 10th in his first
Winston West race. Thompson, 24, put The RoomStore Ford Taurus on
the outside of the fifth row with a speed of 127.348 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Burns of Phoenix starts in Row 14, and Billy Kann of Tempe
starts in the 15th row. &QL;

   HAVANA, Cuba _ When the Cuban hitters face Scott Erickson on
Sunday, it could seem like New York on an April night.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the temperature will be in the mid-80s and the
sun will be shining brightly when the Cuban all-star team plays the
Baltimore Orioles. If Erickson's sinker is working and running into
Cuba's right-handed hitters, ``ouch,'' or worse, could be the
byword of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans can blame it on the new wood bats they will be using
instead of the aluminum bats that have been used in Cuba since
1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is really a big change,'' said Tony Bernazard, a former
major league second baseman, who is in Havana as a representative
of the players association. ``Your hands, the way you grip the bat,
every swing you take, the ball will sting. It's like the first days
of spring training. Guys complain. You feel every pitch. It hurts.
With a sinkerball pitcher, it's even worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles would never have played this game with aluminum
bats, but as it happens the Cubans changed to wood two weeks ago
after the International Baseball Association mandated the change
beginning with this summer's Pan American Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be a problem for the national team; they've
got four months,'' Tony Castillo, the baseball commissioner for
Havana, said Friday, referring to the Pan Am competition. ``But
it's definitely an advantage for the Orioles.''
</P>
<P>
   Castillo echoed the view registered just the night before by a
waiter who identified himself as a fervent fan. ``I think it's
going to be hard for the Cubans, using wood bats,'' said Victor,
the waiter.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo talked about wood bats while visiting Ciudad Deportiva,
a sports training complex, where the Industriales team had just
finished working out for the start of its Cuban League championship
series against Santiago de Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take two or three months of continuous
practice,'' Castillo said. ``We've had 23 years that we've been
playing with aluminum bats. It's tough for the whole world.
Everyone has to change over.''
</P>
<P>
   But the whole world does not play the Orioles on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The batters don't like it, but the pitchers like it,''
Castillo said of the conversion to wood. ``The offensive production
has dropped a lot. There haven't been many long balls hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one home run had been hit in the 20 games that had been
played with wood bats. But yet another change could end the easy
life for pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Because aluminum bats produce harder-hit balls, thus putting
pitchers in jeopardy only 60 feet 6 inches from home plate, the
Cuban League used a ball that was not as hard as the balls the
major leagues use. They continued to use the locally made ball, La
Batos numero 2, when they switched to wood, but the Rawlings ball
used in the United States is to be the pelota of choice for the
championship series.
</P>
<P>
   Amateur teams around the world, including virtually all American
high schools and colleges, initially switched to aluminum as an
economy move decades ago. The bats didn't break, like wood, and
lasted far longer. But each new generation of metal bats turned out
to be more potent _ and dangerous. An increasing number of serious
injuries stemming from hard-hit balls prompted various
organizations, including the NCAA, to look at the bats and begin
placing limits on the type of alloys allowed or to change
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   When officials from the major leagues and the players
association came here two weeks ago, they brought the Cubans four
dozen wood bats, and they brought some more when they arrived
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The use of aluminum bats has made it difficult to judge Cubans
in relation to major league hitters. A batter can hit the ball off
the handle of an aluminum bat, and instead of breaking, as wood
often does, the bat sends the ball looping over the infield for a
single or along one of the foul lines for a double.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hit the ball with an aluminum bat and it goes,'' Bernazard
said. ``With wood bats, you have to hit the ball in the four or
five inches of the meat of the bat. With aluminum bats, you hit it
anywhere and you can get a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   With aluminum bats, too, he added, batters had a tendency to
develop longer swings. With wood, Cuban batters will have to cut
down those swings, getting the head of the bat through the hitting
zone faster.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever disadvantages might exist, though, the Cubans eagerly
looked forward to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will sort of test our level of play against the level of
play in the big leagues,'' Castillo said. ``A lot of time has
passed since a big league team came here to play.''

   CONCERN ABOUT DRUG ISSUES SENDS STOCK MARKET LOWER
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell as Merck and Warner-Lambert suffered setbacks on
profitable drugs. Oracle and other software companies traded on the
Nasdaq gained on speculation that investors overreacted to concern
about slowing sales in the personal computer industry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 14.15 points, to 9,822.24,
while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index dropped 7.19 points, to
1,282.80, with drug makers accounting for 18 percent of the loss.
The Nasdaq composite index declined 15.63 points, to 2,419.17.

<P>
   EUROPEAN UNION APPROVES A BUDGET
</P>
<P>
   The European Union agreed to cap its budget at $92 billion a
year through 2006, enabling three Central European countries _
Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary _ to join. The union also
advocated Palestinian statehood within the next year in more
forthright terms than it had previously used or than the United
States had ever backed, provoking a furious reaction from Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   LIMITS BACKED FOR DIABETES DRUG
</P>
<P>
   A panel of scientific experts recommended that the government
place stricter limits on the use of the diabetes drug Rezulin,
following reports of deaths and serious liver damage. The committee
urged that patients take the drug only when other therapies had
failed but declined to recommend that it be withdrawn from the
market.
</P>
<P>
   PRESIDENT OF TOYS `R' US DEPARTS
</P>
<P>
   Just a year after arriving at Toys ``R'' Us, Bruce W. Krysiak
has resigned as president and chief operating officer of the
beleaguered retailer. Analysts said that he had concluded either
that he would not be named chief executive as he wished, or that
the company's troubles were worse than he had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ASTHMA DRUG WINS FDA APPROVAL
</P>
<P>
   Sepracor received Food and Drug Administration approval to begin
marketing a new asthma-treatment drug that is a variation on the
best-selling asthma drug.
</P>
<P>
   PROFIT AT NESTLE TOPS EXPECTATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Nestle reported a 2.6 percent profit increase for 1998, to 4.29
billion Swiss francs ($2.92 billion). That beat forecasts, which
analysts had pared after a warning from the company. Demand for
products like Perrier mineral water and Alcon contact lens solution
in the United States and Western Europe outweighed slumping income
in Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   VIACOM GIVES CHIEFS STOCK OPTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Viacom gave its top three executives stock options together
valued at about $104 million last year. Sumner M. Redstone, who is
chairman of the media company, received options to buy four million
class B common shares, valued at $52 million, after adjusting for a
2-for-1 stock split scheduled for later this month. Two deputy
chairmen, Philippe P. Dauman and Thomas E. Dooley, each received
options for two million shares, valued at $26 million.

   BOND PRICES DECREASE SLIGHTLY
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices fell as Citigroup and other companies sold $3.8
billion of debt, sapping demand for government securities. The

<TEXT>
<P>
   Millions of Americans have rushed into the brave new world of
electronic stock trading. Armed with fast computers and
sophisticated software, they see themselves not only at the
market's epicenter but also on the same plain as professional
traders. For extra enticement, there are low commissions, sometimes
less than $10 a trade.
</P>
<P>
   What many investors may not realize is that their trades _
particularly in the sizzling Internet stocks with which online
traders are infatuated _ are not finding their way to the market
through traditional channels.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, much of that trading is being piped through new types
of electronic networks _ systems that, in theory, are ideal
marketplaces, where buyers and sellers can trade stocks without
paying a markup to the professional traders who have long served as
middlemen in the NASDAQ market.
</P>
<P>
   The new trading systems, called electronic communications
networks, or ECNs, are pitched as a way for investors to gain
instant access to the markets and to compete head to head with
professional traders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all their promise, the ECNs have distinct downsides.
They and the investors who use them _ including the growing numbers
of rapid-fire day traders _ are contributing to the wild
ricocheting of prices in Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, although commissions to trade online are indeed rock
bottom, there are hidden costs in using the networks. Prices on
these networks are inferior on 8 out of 10 stocks they trade,
according to the National Association of Securities Dealers. In
large part, that is because investors are trading only with other
investors who are using the same network, rather than ``meeting''
all other investors in the broader NASDAQ marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrations over poor prices or trades that were not executed
at all have led some experienced investors to wonder whether
something is amiss between the time orders are placed and the time
they show up on an ECN.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upside is that investors are getting that meeting
possibility,'' said Richard G. Ketchum, president of the NASD.
``The downside is that they are not getting any execution
guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   The networks now account for about 20 percent of trading in
NASDAQ stocks _ more than the volume on the American Stock Exchange
and all the nation's regional stock exchanges combined. But even
investors who are not using the networks have reason to be
concerned, as volatility jumps and total trading costs increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a period of disequilibrium right now,'' said Bruce
Weber, assistant professor of information systems at New York
University's Stern School of Business. ``Anybody that's trading a
NASDAQ stock these days has to work harder to find the best price
and ideal counterparties than they did maybe three or four years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   With the NASDAQ composite index up 10 percent so far this year,
the problems have been largely papered over by investor profits.
Not until a full-fledged market dive will investors find out
whether the fragmented marketplace created by the rise of the ECNs
will make it harder to sell _ or harder to sell at a good price.
Such difficulties could make jittery investors panic, turning a
trickle of selling into a flood and pulling down more established
stocks, too.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators opened the door wide to the new networks after they
found in the mid-1990s that traders in NASDAQ stocks were profiting
from artificially wide spreads _ the difference between the price
at which traders buy shares from sellers and the price at which
they will resell them to buyers.
</P>
<P>
   In the most important change, regulators forced NASDAQ traders
to display customers' orders that fell at prices within the spread.
They also encouraged the creation of new networks that would allow
investors to meet. Rather than taking a markup on trades, the
networks profit by charging a small fee for each transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the electronic networks operate today for institutional
investors. The oldest is Instinet, a unit of Reuters Group PLC. But
two fast-growing services cater to individual investors: Island, a
two-year-old network owned by Datek Holdings, a discount brokerage
firm in Iselin, N.J., and Archipelago, a Chicago company whose
owners include Goldman, Sachs and E(star)Trade Group. The 200,000
customers of Datek Online have trades funneled to Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``ECNs are one of the most dramatic forces reshaping the equity
markets,'' said David Cushing, director of research at ITG Inc., a
research and trading company that runs a trade-matching service for
institutional investors called ITG Posit. ``I think ECNs have a
very valuable role in improving the efficiency of the market. The
downside is, many of the benefits of ECNs have been co-opted by the
professional day trader. Some of the ways they are being used right
now are not in the market's best interest.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ECNs play a significant role in the increasing volatility in
many NASDAQ stocks. A growing number of day traders, who buy and
sell furiously all day long, hoping to capture tiny per-share
profits on large trades, execute their orders on the networks.
Their lemming-like behavior in stocks that are already moving has
made 15-point single-day swings common.
</P>
<P>
   Even the occasional trader who uses an ECN can add to
volatility. If a customer offers to buy shares at a price well
above the market _ something that happens increasingly, with so
many online traders eager to buy hot stocks at any price _ the
offer is flashed on other investors' screens, helping push the
market higher. At a brokerage firm, that order would probably be
executed at the lower price.
</P>
<P>
   The day traders and the price-is-no-object investors are
creating wild price swings in Internet stocks, which trade widely
on ECNs. According to ITG, daily swings in an index of Internet
stocks have been running at more than twice the rate of the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index. Such volatility increases
investors' anxieties and raises their costs by making it more
difficult to get in and out of positions.

HUNDLEY COMFORTABLE AND READY TO RUMBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Todd Hundley maintains his elbow is fine, but
even he said it took Friday's start behind the plate to ease his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time this spring, Hundley caught a game. And
though his stint lasted less than two innings before rain forced a
lengthy delay, his surgically repaired right elbow was tested.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest moment came in the top of the second when B.J.
Surhoff stole second on a 3-2, one-out pitch. The Orioles' Esteban
Beltre struck out, and stepped across the plate when Hundley was
throwing. It forced Hundley to whip his arm sideways.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I threw it, it was, `How much pain was going to come?'''
Hundley said. ``And no pain came. You let it fly and hope you don't
fall on your knees. Velocity-wise, I thought it was a good throw,
and it didn't hurt. That's the main thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, who was scheduled to play three innings, was elated to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I love to do and I haven't been able to do it for a
long time,'' said Hundley, who singled in his only at-bat. ``I'm
ecstatic. It's a good day in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley won't make the trip to Jupiter, Fla., today to face the
St. Louis Cardinals, but manager Davey Johnson said he plans to
catch Hundley again Sunday in a game televised in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in (before the game) and was all smiles,'' Johnson
said. ``I'm sure he's going to be a little bit sore. I'm not
thinking his arm is going to be sore, the rest of his body will be
sore.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he wants Hundley to make two or three more starts
before the Los Angeles Dodgers break camp after Wednesday's game.
Hundley said it will take a few more outings before he feels
comfortable, but wouldn't speculate on how often he would be able
to catch once the season began.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was equally hesitant to say how often Hundley could
catch once the season begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll see how aggressive I can be with him, and how he feels,''
Johnson said. ``I don't have any concerns about him throwing. It's
the swinging, and how aggressive he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliever impresses: Johnson said he saw enough of lefty reliever
Jeff Williams to take another look at him early next week. Williams
allowed two runs on one hit in three innings. He also struck out
five.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to go a fourth inning,'' Johnson said. ``I shut him
off so I could get one more peek at him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are looking for a lefty in the bullpen and dipped
into minor league camp to give the 26-year-old Williams a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Laker traded: The Dodgers traded minor-league catcher Tim Laker,
a Simi Valley High product, to the Pittsburgh Pirates for a player
to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Laker played with the Pirates for part of last
season. He also saw time with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, hitting
.345 with a homer and two RBI in 17 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   Laker was in major-league camp with the Dodgers until March 16,
when he was reassigned to minor-league camp. He batted .150 with
one RBI in 10 games this spring.
</P>
<P>
   An April 5 preview: Hundley's inclusion gave the lineup an
opening-night look. Eric Young led off, followed by Hundley, Gary
Sheffield, Devon White, Raul Mondesi, Eric Karros, Mark
Grudzielanek, Adrian Beltre (third base) and pitcher Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he also was toying with the idea of batting White
fourth in the lineup, and possibly flip-flopping Hundley with
Grudzielanek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Johnson said. ``I like the feel of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Though Johnson hasn't officially named a
starting rotation, he said it would remain consistent with the
Grapefruit League opener. That would mean Brown in the opener
followed by Chan Ho Park, Ismael Valdes, Carlos Perez and Darren
Dreifort. Since the Dodgers play 17 straight days to start the
season, nobody is scheduled to be bumped a day in the rotation....
Time appears to be running out for right-handed reliever Doug
Bochtler. The rain washed out another scheduled appearance.
Bochtler has made each of the past two road trips but hasn't
pitched. He last appeared in a game last Saturday against the
Orioles.... Though Brown's start got washed out after two innings,
he completed his work in the batting cage. He tossed three more
simulated innings, topping the 110-pitch count.

 UNDATED: of positions.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``People take pride in the fact that spreads in stocks have
narrowed, but intraday price changes are bigger than they've ever
been,'' said Andrew M. Brooks, vice president in charge of equity
trading at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore. ``I don't think we've ever
had an environment like that.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem posed by ECNs is the fragmentation of the
market for NASDAQ stocks. The NASDAQ has always been fragmented
because it has no central trading floor. The ECNs split up the
market even more. When fewer trades are posted in one place, it is
less likely that orders to buy and sell at the same price will find
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Colby, deputy director of the Securities and Exchange
Commission's division of market regulation, said that although the
changes after the NASDAQ investigation have helped investors,
``it's still a dispersed market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the volume is going on in one place, and you are at
another, you won't get executed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An investor can also wind up with an inferior price. Say a stock
is quoted on ECN. ``A'' at $10.25 (the ``bid'' price) and at
$10.3825 (the ``offered'' price), while ECN ``B'' has prices of
$10.25 bid, $10.3125 offered. An investor interested in buying the
shares at the prevailing price would pay more to trade on ``A.''
</P>
<P>
   Or say an investor has placed a limit order _ an order to buy
stock at a set price _ on an ECN. If there is no seller willing to
take the other side of the trade at that price, his order remains
unfilled.
</P>
<P>
   After it becomes evident that the trade cannot be matched at the
ECN, the investor, if he understands how NASDAQ trading works, can
cancel his order and route it to another system, or to a big market
maker like Merrill Lynch or Knight Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, this time lapse _ maybe just a few seconds _ can be
costly. The price the investor wanted to pay may be vastly
different from the new one. If the market price is much higher, the
order is not executed. If the market price has fallen
significantly, the order is executed _ but the investor pays more
for the stock.
</P>
<P>
   If ECNs were all linked into a central order book, that problem
would disappear. The NASD wants to knit the marketplace together
but has encountered resistance from some members. Until it does,
the greater the volume on an ECN, the more likely that a customer's
order will be matched quickly.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, clients of Island, which traded 813 million
shares for customers in January, are more apt to get their trades
matched in-house than are customers of Archipelago, whose volume
for the month was 90.5 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   But even on a populous ECN like Island, it is unlikely that an
investor will get the best price for his trade. According to a
study last year by the NASD, in 81 percent of all NASDAQ stocks
actively quoted, traditional market makers had better prices than
any ECN. In only 11 percent of the stocks did ECNs have superior
prices. In the remainder, both ECNs and traditional market makers
offered the best prices. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to costs, most investors focus only on their
brokerage commissions. But explicit costs like commissions make up
only 10 percent of an investor's total costs, according to Salomon
Smith Barney. Implicit costs _ such as what an investor pays for a
volatile stock or when trades are badly executed _ make up the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Noser of the Abel/Noser Corp. in New York, who tracks
trading costs, says that implicit factors _ including those driven
by the rise of ECNs _ are very high for popular Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take the trading costs of a Yahoo or Ebay or Excite,
they are astronomical,'' he said. ``It is very difficult and
expensive to try to execute orders in these stocks.'' According to
Abel/Noser, while the average cost of trading New York Stock
Exchange, American Stock Exchange and NASDAQ stocks is about 0.16
percent of the transaction amount, the average cost to trade Ebay
in the last six months of 1998 was roughly 0.4 percent; for Yahoo,
it was 0.22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ECNs, unlike market makers, charge other dealers to execute on
their networks, increasing costs.
</P>
<P>
   And these stocks may be costly to trade because the size of the
typical trade is small: 1,000 shares or less. When smaller orders
dominate trading, it is more likely that a single order will move
the price of the stock, increasing investors' costs.
</P>
<P>
   In February, more than three out of four trades in both
Amazon.com and Yahoo were for 1,000 shares or less. Almost 80
percent of Ebay's trades fell into this category. Dell, which has
been trading far longer than these young Internet enterprises, had
67 percent of its trades move in small orders last year, up from 31
percent in 1994. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There may be other reasons it is so costly to trade these stocks
online.
</P>
<P>
   A few experienced traders who say they have received bad
executions on stock trades at both Datek Online and Terra Nova
Trading, the brokerage firm affiliated with Archipelago, are
wondering whether people who work for these firms have been jumping
in to take better prices for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald D. Putnam, owner of Terra Nova and part-owner of
Archipelago, says none of his employees trade against customers'
orders. The practice, which is against securities regulations, was
rampant on the NASDAQ stock market before the SEC's crackdown in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Andresen, president of Island ECN, did not respond to a
reporter's questions.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for such improper trading at ECNs affiliated with
a brokerage firm _ like both Island and Archipelago _ remains a
concern of regulators. In a statement last fall, the SEC instructed
ECNs and their affiliates to set up procedures to prevent employees
from using confidential information in trading.

 UNDATED: in trading.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The temptation to trade ahead of a customer is greatest when
investors place market orders, meaning that they will buy or sell
at the prevailing price.
</P>
<P>
   A brokerage employee who receives a market order for 1,000
shares of Yahoo is supposed to complete the trade at the market
price within 30 seconds. But given the rapid price changes in these
stocks, the trader could easily complete the customer's trade at a
price fractionally higher than the market and take the lower price
for himself.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the investor's price is in the range, the brokerage
firm can argue that it gave its customer the ``market'' at the
time. Only a study of each transaction, second by second, would
reveal the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the NASD has stated that during fast or exceedingly
volatile markets, traders can be excused from this 30-second rule,
giving them even more flexibility. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the experienced investors to raise questions about the
quality of executions on some ECNs is Greg F. Mazzeo, who traded
over-the-counter stocks professionally for 15 years and now trades
for himself. In documents he has compiled meticulously, Mazzeo
points to numerous examples of market orders that he placed with
Datek Online and Island ECN that were not executed for minutes at a
time, or were executed at prices that to him were suspiciously off
the prevailing market levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not accusing them of front-running orders or holding
orders for their own benefit,'' he said. ``But the time it takes to
execute and the price of execution on market orders at times are
highly suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the seven months that he was trading through Datek, until
March, Mazzeo made numerous complaints to the firm. Datek's policy
is to rescind commission charges if a customer's ``marketable''
order is not executed within 90 seconds. Mazzeo said he paid no
commission on roughly a third of his orders.
</P>
<P>
   Using sophisticated software, Mazzeo can watch all the action in
a stock. And what he saw on one trade early this year troubled him.
On Jan. 15, Mazzeo put in an order to sell 500 shares of Network
Event Theatre, a small NASDAQ stock that rarely trades. The bid
price on the stock was $13.8125 when he placed his market order on
Datek Online.
</P>
<P>
   For minutes, no offers to buy were posted on the network. Then a
500-share lot traded, and the bid price began to fall. Still,
Mazzeo's shares were not sold until the bid fell to $13.4375.
</P>
<P>
   A computer glitch? An old order suddenly processed? Perhaps, but
with Mazzeo's market order in hand, the firm's traders could have
sold 500 shares that they did not yet own at $13.8125. Such a
``short'' sale in a thinly traded stock could easily have lowered
the bid price to $13.4375, at which time a trader could have bought
Mazzeo's 500 shares and covered his short position at a profit of
$187.50.
</P>
<P>
   Datek did not respond to written questions about these trades.
</P>
<P>
   While ECNs have contributed to rising stock prices, no one knows
for sure what their role will be in a market crash.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the NASDAQ market makers they hope to replace, ECNs do
not commit any capital to maintain orderly markets in the stocks
they trade. While most large, reputable market makers stand ready
to buy or sell 1,000 shares of the stocks they trade _ they are
required to handle 100-share trades _ ECNs do not.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, according to NASDAQ, the average block of stock
available at the best bid or offer on an electronic network last
year was only 340 shares. So an investor with more than 340 shares
to sell or buy may well have his offer only partly filled. By
comparison, the average block available from a market maker was
1,741 shares.
</P>
<P>
   What does all this mean? If the online traders' favorite stocks
start to fall from the sky, the people who trade on ECNs may not be
able to get out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to a point of uncertainty and no one is going to sit
out there and say they are a buyer during a market break,'' said
Ketchum of the NASD. ``If markets drop, ECNs have a harder time
providing liquidity.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, for ECNs, the resulting stampede for the exits
could make the 1987 crash look like a day at the beach.

 (ATTN: Mass. )ARTHUR RAYMOND, DC-3 MAKER, DIES AT 99   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur E. Raymond, whose career spanned the years between
biplanes and the first lunar landing but who was best known for
leading the team that designed the DC-3, one of commercial
aviation's most durable workhorses, died on Monday at St. John's
Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. He was two days short of his 100th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Emmons Raymond was a young engineer at the Douglas
Aircraft Co. in 1932 when Donald W. Douglas, the company's founder,
was asked to design a new passenger plane for Transcontinental and
Western Air Inc., later known as Trans World Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   TWA's transcontinental business was suffering because United
Airlines was flying twin-engine Boeing 247s across the country in
19.5 hours, nearly 8 hours faster than it took TWA's Ford
Trimotors.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, which had seen its military business decline, took up
the challenge, and Raymond flew to New York to help sell Charles
Lindbergh, then a consultant to TWA, on the idea of a new
twin-engine plane with an aluminum skin. Douglas named the airplane
the DC-1 for Douglas Commercial model No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the plane went into production, it was improved and
called the DC-2. The 14-passenger craft became an instant hit for
both Douglas and TWA, flying coast to coast in 18 hours with stops
in Chicago, Kansas City, Mo., and Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   But that success would pale compared with the success of the
DC-3. In 1934, Raymond was named chief engineer at Douglas and led
the team that built the successor to the DC-2, a wider version,
seating three passengers in each row, that was almost an entirely
new airplane. It was the first commercial plane to make money for
airlines without carrying mail and became one of the best-selling
airplanes of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the DC-3, he did almost everything,'' said his grandson,
Stephen Raymond. ``He knew every bolt and screw in that plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Within three years, Douglas was churning out one DC-3 every
three days and still could not keep up with demand. Nearly 11,000
of the airplanes were built between 1934 and 1945, and about 2,000
are still flying.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being durable, the DC-3 was known for being easy
to fly. Pilots boasted that the plane could fly itself. In addition
to carrying passengers, it played a crucial role as a cargo plane
in World War II and during the Cold War, helping ferry supplies in
the Berlin Airlift.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond went on to play a crucial role in designing the
four-engine DC-4, as well as the DC-6 and DC-7. The last plane he
helped develop at Douglas was the DC-8, the company's first to be
equipped with jet engines.
</P>
<P>
   Later he played a key role in the Apollo and Gemini missions as
a consultant to NASA and was one of the founders of the Rand Corp.,
the famous research center in Santa Monica, Calif. But Raymond
never became nearly as well known as the things he helped create.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though he got a lot of recognition from his peers during
his active career,'' said Don Hanson, who worked as a spokesman for
Douglas Aircraft for 34 years and knew Raymond, ``I think that
Raymond is still underappreciated for the contributions he made to
aeronautical design technology and for the contributions he made in
setting high standards for aviation.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Boston in 1899, Raymond moved to Pasadena, Calif., at
age 3. His earliest memories, said his grandson, were of the
opening of the Raymond Hotel, a luxury resort owned by his father
that catered to wealthy visitors like Andrew Carnegie and Theodore
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 15, Raymond went up in a dirigible owned by Roy
Knabenshue, a well-known aviator at the time, and flying became his
passion. He returned East to attend Harvard College and then
received a degree in the new discipline of aeronautical engineering
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   But Raymond rushed back to California before the graduation
ceremony to marry the former Dorothy Lee, his high school
sweetheart. They were together until her death in 1986. Their only
child, Stanley Walter Raymond, died in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Raymond married Mimi Hunt, who died in 1993. He is
survived by five grandsons.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to California in 1921, Raymond worked briefly
for his father at the hotel but soon quit to pursue his dream of
building airplanes. He had been working as a metal fitter at
Douglas for six weeks when Donald Douglas called MIT looking for an
engineer. One of Raymond's former professors told Douglas that he
already had a fine engineer working in his shop.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond's most triumphant year, 1934, when he was overseeing the
development of the DC-3, was also bittersweet. In the midst of the
Depression, his father was forced to close the Raymond Hotel and
soon died.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, Raymond helped managed the huge effort that
produced tens of thousands of aircraft for the war effort. After
the war ended, he proposed to military air officials that they
bring together figures from the government and industry to
investigate issues related to intercontinental warfare. The
organization became the Rand Corp., which later branched out into
the social sciences.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from Douglas in 1960, Raymond embarked on a new
adventure as a special consultant to James E. Webb, NASA's
administrator. Raymond, who was known for both his precision and
his integrity, was put in charge of supervising the outside
contractors on both the Gemini and Apollo space projects until
1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always known as the kind of person who spoke truth to
power,'' his grandson, Stephen, said. ``They depended on him to
unearth the things that were wrong from the spinmeisters who were
saying everything was dandy.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Raymond argued that the first supersonic transport was
not commercially viable. The government eventually abandoned the
project, leaving it to the Europeans and the Soviet Union to
develop a supersonic passenger plane.
</P>
<P>
   One of Raymond's proudest moments, his grandson said, was in
November 1991, when he received the National Air and Space Museum
Trophy for lifetime achievement. The reception in Washington, at
which he spoke, was held a stone's throw from where one of his
DC-3's hangs.

KWAN TUMBLES INTO FOURTH PLACE AFTER SHORT PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland _ The day after Aleksei Yagudin leaned over
and kissed the ice after flirting with perfection, Michelle Kwan
skidded across the ice after falling on her double axel.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two teen-agers who came here to defend their world
titles, Kwan figured to have the easier path to another gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   But while Yagudin has already won the men's event, Kwan's path
is now cluttered with skaters who performed better under pressure
than she did in the short program Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't on; I haven't been on all week,'' Kwan said.
``Usually I'm pretty solid and consistent, but I've been a little
shaky.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan, who has been suffering from a head cold, would end up
finishing a rather generous fourth in the short program and is
fourth overall after two phases of the three-phase women's event.
</P>
<P>
   Though she still has a chance to win her second consecutive
title, Kwan will need more than an excellent performance Saturday
in the free skate.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan will need help from Mariya Butyrskaya, the 26-year-old who
skated one of the cleanest and smoothest short programs of her
career Friday to move into first place.
</P>
<P>
   Butyrskaya's Russian teammate, Julia Soldatova, is in second.
Vanessa Gusmeroli of France is third. The encouraging news for
Kwan, who will skate last on Saturday, is that none of those three
has won a world or Olympic title, and Butyrskaya and Gusmeroli have
a history of letting nerves get the better of their potential.
</P>
<P>
   Butyrskaya can finish second in the free skate to Kwan and still
win her first world title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly can win the long,'' Kwan said. ``But now I don't
control my own destiny. It's hard to rely on other skaters to miss.
It's bad karma.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia is also in position to become the first country to win
all four events during one world championships.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Russian victories in the men's and the pairs, the
ice dancing team of Anjelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsyannikov won their
country's third gold medal here Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Krylova and Ovsyannikov, who have trained and lived in Newark,
Del., since 1994, won by the narrowest of margins over Marina
Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of France.
</P>
<P>
   The French free dance, set to music from the movie ``Man in the
Iron Mask,'' was more accessible and romantic than the Russians'
frenetic and relentlessly exuberant performance to the sound of
African drums.
</P>
<P>
   The judges scored it 5-4 in favor of the defending world
champions. Even if the French had won, Russia could have claimed
some credit, because Anissina was born and raised in Moscow. The
bronze medal went to the Canadians Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor
Kraatz, their fourth straight bronze at the worlds.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kwan's missed double axel was not the only cause for concern
during her performance. On her opening jump, she began listing as
she spun in the air but somehow managed to right herself in time to
land her triple lutz and then complete the combination with a
double toe loop.
</P>
<P>
   After her fall, Kwan briefly looked stiff and disoriented. She
ended up receiving marks ranging from 5.1 to 5.5 for technical
merit (a fall in the short program incurs a mandatory 0.4
deduction). Kwan still received her customarily high marks for
presentation: all 5.8s and 5.9s, but three of the nine judges
placed her fifth, one placed her sixth, another seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan conceded that she felt fortunate to be fourth. ``I'm very
disappointed in how I skated; I looked into the monitor and saw I
was fourth and didn't believe they held me up there,'' she said of
the judges.
</P>
<P>
   While Kwan was fourth and driven to tears, 13-year-old Sarah
Hughes of Great Neck, N.Y., was ninth and delighted. Though Hughes
still lacks the speed and polish of her elders, she landed all of
her required jumps Friday: a double axel, a difficult triple
lutz-double toe combination and a triple flip in her first event at
this level.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes also shrugged off the remarkable disparity in her scores,
with her technical marks ranging from 4.4 to 5.4 and her artistic
marks from 5.0 to 5.7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to skate my program and look like I belonged,''
she said.

TORRE VISITS CLUBHOUSE 8 DAYS AFTER CANCER SURGERY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)   By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Just eight days after undergoing surgery to remove
his cancerous prostate, manager Joe Torre showed up in the Yankees'
clubhouse Friday, assuring his players in a closed-door meeting
that he is on the way to a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought it was important for them to see that I'm
feeling fine, and it's just a matter of time, basically,'' Torre
said afterward, sitting in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher David Cone said it was comforting. ``It's quite
remarkable to see him in such good shape,'' Cone said, ``moving
around so well and in such good spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre, 58, said he planned to be with the team every day for the
rest of spring training, ``or at least two of every three days.''
</P>
<P>
   But he emphasized that he was in no rush to resume managing and
that he had no intention of establishing a timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to set something I can't live up to and then all
of a sudden the flag goes up, saying, `Uh-oh,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether he will be at the Yankees' home opener on April 9
against Detroit, he said: ``I may be visible, but I'm not going to
be directing the team. Don Zimmer's done enough of that during his
career, a lot longer than I have. That doesn't mean I'm going to
stay away.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre had surgery on March 18 in St. Louis and left the hospital
three days later. Torre's doctor, the noted urologist William
Catalona, suggested on Thursday that Torre meet with his team three
days earlier than planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just thought I needed a little more stimulation,'' Torre
said.
</P>
<P>
   The manager's biggest challenge now, he said, is to get his
strength back. ``That's the thing where the question comes in. Just
because of the surgery, your blood count goes down and you tend to
be a little anemic. That's the area where you have to keep an eye
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said that to regain his strength he would eat heartily and
take daily iron pills.
</P>
<P>
   Catalona had said after the surgery that Torre should expect to
resume managing the team in 6 to 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the day I'm fine,'' Torre said. ``Then it just sort
of tapers off. I can't wait to get out of bed; then all of a sudden
it disappears. I'm going to make sure that gets better. I'm not
going to be anxious in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   His first post-surgery baseball work took place by telephone
earlier in the week. He talked with outfielder Darryl Strawberry,
who is recovering from colon cancer surgery, about Strawberry's
chances of making the opening day roster. On Thursday Torre
participated via telephone in a two-hour discussion on Yankee
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to rely more on people who've seen these players
play,'' Torre said. ``But I'm still involved in making decisions.
Actually there's not very many decisions to be made. I'm sure you'd
like another utility man, but right now that guy isn't apparent.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said the only significant decisions left are whether the
opening day roster should include pitcher Andy Pettitte, who is
working his way back from left elbow tightness, and Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   Torre expects to be re-examined in about a month to make sure he
does not require any radiation or chemotherapy. But he is starting
to feel frisky again. He can tell that, he said, because he is
beginning to recapture the feeling that winning baseball games is
the most important thing in the world to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the initial shock, when you feel wonderful and find
out you're not, is tough to get over,'' he said. ``But now that the
surgery is behind me, my mental outlook is better.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte said the first thing he does daily when he wakes
up is to test his left elbow for tightness. ``It feels great,'' he
said Friday. ``I want to pitch, but they're not giving me any
answers.'' &QL;

   And Our Next Sports Car Will Be Called the Blue Devil &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Originally, G. Richard Wagoner Jr., president of General Motors,
was going to be the host of a reception Monday night at Cipriani
42nd Street, in advance of the New York Auto Show. But GM had a
change of heart after a restaurant workers' union ran a newspaper
ad urging a boycott of the Rainbow Room, another establishment run
by the Cipriani family, and saying, ``a lot of people think the
Ciprianis have hearts of stone.''
</P>
<P>
   The car maker promptly switched the site to Vanderbilt Hall of
Grand Central Terminal, but the change it highlighted in large
letters in its letter to the media was something else altogether.
</P>

   It seems that Wagoner was a member of Duke University's
basketball team in the 1970s and remains a fanatical follower of
the Blue Devils. He planned to attend Saturday night's matchup with
Michigan State and, whether Duke won or lost, to catch the national
college championship game Monday at 9:18 p.m. So, the revised
invitation reads, ``As an added attraction, we'll stick around
after the reception and invite you to join us for an NCAA Finals
party.'' &QL;

   Who says the workplace has to be about carpel tunnel syndrome?
``There are a lot of demented minds out there ready to have fun,''
said Matt Weinstein, the mastermind behind the fourth annual
International Fun at Work Day on April 1. Weinstein, founder of
Playfair Inc., a San Francisco consulting firm, has signed up
hundreds of companies, including Federal Express and AT&AMP;T, for the
event.

<P>
   Last year, the folks at A Business Conference Call, in Chaska,
Minn., dressed backwards and talked backwards (``Now lunch to going
am I''), while Sprint employees in 20 cities took snapshots of
themselves doing goofy things like sitting on a police car or
playing catch with a dog. This year, a guru in Madras, India, will
hold laughter seminars and employees at the Mutual Aid Association
in Nebraska will post photographs of their bare feet on bulletin
boards. ``It's treating people at work like you would treat your
family,'' Weinstein said, ``if you had fun with your family.''

   The rich and famous came out in force on Wednesday at the
International Asian Art Fair in Manhattan, but they were mostly
just looking. Veronica Hearst, wearing part of a diamond stomacher
with a big pearl drop, said her husband, Randolph Hearst, chairman
of the Hearst Corp., ``likes jade, and if I see something I like,
I'll surprise him.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll Petrie, widow of the retailing giant Milton Petrie,
focused on coloration. ``I love blue and white, and that's what I'm
looking for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Upon leaving, Winston Fowlkes, former treasurer at the old Time
Inc., said, ``I saw a couple of things that are under serious
consideration.'' His wife, Isabel, beamed.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, though. The event raised $400,000 for the Asia
Society. Besides, even royalty balked at the price tags. When the
Crown Princess of Greece, the former Marie-Chantal Miller, allowed
that ``there are some beautiful things here,'' her husband, Crown
Prince Pavlos, arched his eyebrows in regal alarm. ``Not yet,'' he
declared. ``We can't afford it.'' &QL;

   Bridging Boundaries in Israel &QL;

   With ethnic conflict rampant in the world, reconciliation is
suddenly big news in Israel. This month, Rana Raslan became the
first Arab Miss Israel, Abdel Rahman Zu'bi became the first Arab
appointed to the Israeli Supreme Court and an Arab member of
parliament said he would run for prime minister. It was the sort of
ethnic intermingling that a couple of New York money managers, one
Jewish, the other Arab-American, have promoted for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the events that raise the consciousness of the Jews
and Arabs of Israel,'' said Alan B. Slifka, founder of the Abraham
Fund, which recruits donors to ``adopt'' programs in Israel, from
theater groups to day-care centers, that bring the two communities
together. ``We can be viewed as a coexistence mutual fund.''
Slifka, the managing principal of Halcyon/Alan B. Slifka Management
Co., added that the fund has offered to sponsor a tour of the
United States by Ms. Raslan.
</P>
<P>
   James D. Awad, the founder of Awad Asset Management and a member
of the fund's board, says the grass-roots contacts it fosters are
the best hope for peace in the Mideast. The grandson of Arab
Christians who fled Syria, he says half his clients are Jewish, but
he also manages money for Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. &QL;

PERRY RETURNS TO FOOTBALL, MIGHT BE TROJAN AGAIN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former USC wide receiver Rod Perry has met with
coach Paul Hackett, and the Trojans are among several schools Perry
is considering transferring to from Cal State Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   Perry left USC last summer and enrolled at Cal State Fullerton
after he decided he would rather become a full-time baseball
player.
</P>
<P>
   But he quit the Titans baseball team three weeks ago after
experiencing a change of heart, and is taking at least five
football recruiting trips before making a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and his dad came in,'' Hackett said. ``I said, `I really
don't know you. I haven't seen you play. I'm not going to start
recruiting you, but I'm not going to close the door.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wanted to come here, we would find a scholarship for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry is visiting Penn State this weekend. He has already
visited Nevada-Las Vegas, which is coached by John Robinson, who
recruited Perry to USC.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he goes, Perry will be eligible immediately, because he
has not participated in a college football practice since 1997,
meaning he would fall under the NCAA's two-year no-participation
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Spring practice opens: The Trojans held their first official
practice at Howard Jones Field on Friday. Looking in midseason form
was wide receiver R. Jay Soward, who was AWOL from the program for
several weeks and considered applying for the NFL's supplemental
draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had fun. It was good to be back playing football and not
just running, running, running,'' Soward said. ``I just realized
how much I missed it.''

COMMENTARY: MILOSEVIC'S CAMPAIGN OF TERROR 
</HEADLINE>
  (changes spelling of Keljmendi to Kelmendi) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For three days now, on Slobodan Milosevic's orders,
Serbian policemen, soldiers and paramilitary thugs have been
spreading terror across Kosovo. They have burned and shelled
villages, driven thousands of ethnic Albanians from their homes and
carried out dozens of assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the terror campaign has not fully registered in the
outside world because Milosevic has expelled Western journalists
and cut off television links. But enough details have got through
to make clear that a human disaster is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   One example: On Thursday a respected source saw many thousands
of civilians making a forced march from the town of Qirez. Serbian
tanks were behind a column, a mile or more long, of men, women and
children. What happened to them is not known.
</P>
<P>
   A second example: At 1:10 a.m. on Thursday armed men in black
uniforms with Serbian police insignia broke into the Pristina home
of a leading Kosovo Albanian human rights lawyer, Bajram Kelmendi.
His wife said they shouted, ``You have five seconds to come out of
your rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   The policemen ransacked the house, beat Kelmendi and took him
and his two sons away. At daybreak Mrs. Kelmendi went to police
headquarters, where she was told to take her troubles to NATO and
the Kosovo Liberation Army. Friday Kelmendi and his sons were found
shot dead a few miles from Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   A third: Serbian police shot the elderly doorman at the last
Albanian-language newspaper in Kosovo, Koha Ditore, as they shut
the paper down. The publisher, Veton Surroi, went into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has targeted for kidnapping and assassination the top
Albanian editors, lawyers, doctors and educators. The idea is to
decapitate the leadership _ exactly what his killers set out to do
in Bosnia seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Milosevic terror campaign mocks one of the main purposes
given by President Clinton and others for the NATO operation. In
the president's words, that is ``to deter an even bloodier
offensive against innocent civilians in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   If we and our allies did not act, Clinton said, ``President
Milosevic would read our hesitation as a license to kill. There
would be many more massacres _ tens of thousands more refugees,
more victims crying out for revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has, rather, made the NATO operation a license to
kill. The massacres are occurring, and there are tens of thousands
of new refugees. That puts a heavy responsibility on Clinton. He
faces a humanitarian debacle. What should he do?
</P>
<P>
   First, he should support the NATO Supreme Commander, Gen. Wesley
Clark, in his desire to intensify the air attacks. The scale of the
operation so far has been nowhere near large enough to make
Milosevic believe we mean business _ much less to destroy his
military power.
</P>
<P>
   Second, NATO must begin using in Kosovo the aircraft that
operate against tanks and artillery: attack helicopters and A-10
Warthogs. They have been held back because they fly lower and
slower, and hence are more vulnerable to anti-aircraft weapons. But
not using them means giving a free hand to Milosevic in his Kosovo
terror campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the United States has compelling evidence of what
Milosevic is doing in Kosovo: high-resolution photographs from
satellites that show burning villages and shattered houses. We
should publish those pictures to counter Milosevic's tactic of
shutting out the world.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, NATO has to face the fact that more than air power may
be needed to save the people of Kosovo. Clinton and the Europeans
have said that no ground forces would go in unless Milosevic
agreed. But we are beyond that now. We have to think about a
protection force on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy, and it never was going to be. But caving in to
Slobodan Milosevic would be inestimably worse. He is using the
tactics of the Gestapo. His regime increasingly has the smell of
the first fascist state in post-Cold War Europe.
</P>
<P>
   What will NATO celebrate at its 50th anniversary party next
month if it has allowed Kosovo to become a graveyard? What will
become of the humanitarian ideal, of what Clinton called ``a moral
imperative''? One former diplomat said: ``If they don't get
serious, Kosovo will be the humanitarian Bay of Pigs.''

CALLS TO PROTEST DIALLO KILLING TAPPED INTO FRUSTRATIONS OVER NYC
POLICE
</HEADLINE>
  (also see NY-POLICE-INDICT)  
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The plan was simple, an old-fashioned civil
disobedience campaign to protest the Feb. 4 shooting death of
Amadou Diallo. But when the Rev. Al Sharpton counted his troops
early this month, he had only about 80 people willing to get
arrested for the cause.
</P>
<P>
   They were mostly professional protesters, fist shakers,
tried-and-true community advocates. Not exactly the stuff of
front-page headlines.
</P>
<P>
   But after the first week of protests outside Police Headquarters
in lower Manhattan, the Rev. Gary V. Simpson of Concord Baptist
Church in Brooklyn called his black, middle-class congregation to
arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting arrested,'' he said at a Sunday morning service.
``Who's going with me?'' More then 30 nurses, teachers, students
and retirees rose to their feet. ``I stood slowly, but I stood,''
said Makeba D'Abreu, 30, a divinity student who had never been
arrested before Wednesday. ``I was scared, but I had to do it. It
was all piling up. It was a pattern of police abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   After the second week of protests, Arthur Strimling signed on,
too, invited by his rabbi. For years, Strimling had viewed street
marches as relics of the 1960s. But he was outraged by Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's refusal to discuss concerns about the police
with moderate black politicians and others. ``This is the only way
to get him to listen,'' said Strimling, 57, a theater director from
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   And by this week, the third week of daily protests, it was clear
that what Sharpton started had become one of New York City's most
successful protest machines. The demonstrations, which sputtered to
a start with 12 arrests on March 9, swelled into one of the largest
and most diverse civil disobedience campaigns in recent years, with
police tallying 216 arrests Friday for a total of 1,009.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly why Sharpton's call ultimately appealed to
so many. Some marchers clearly came for the glory of it all, to
shake their fists for the television cameras and to ogle
celebrities like Susan Sarandon and Ossie Davis who were handcuffed
in Diallo's name.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews, more than a dozen protesters said Sharpton
had tapped into their frustrations with overly aggressive policing
and with a stubborn mayor, who refused to meet or talk with his
critics, including respected elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators also found comfort in the carefully
choreographed procedures, which allowed people to schedule arrests
and to experience little discomfort. (Protesters could even buy ice
cream and chocolate bars from vending machines while their arrests
were processed.)
</P>
<P>
   Workers could arrange to take time off and march with their
churches, unions and neighborhood groups. And the presence of
moderate black politicians and ministers helped persuade some white
people to put aside their distrust of Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, it was just one of those things going on in this
city, far away from my normal life,'' said Strimling, who lives in
Park Slope and was arrested on Wednesday. ``It was Sharpton and his
followers, and God knows, that's not my world. I'm a nice, white
middle-class guy. I don't get arrested. I have no love for
Sharpton.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton has said that the daily protests will continue until
the indictments against the officers in the Diallo shooting are
unsealed. But callers are still burning up the phone line at his
Harlem office. One woman called this week, trying to sign up for
next Friday.

VAN SEIZED FROM NYC OFFICER CHARGED WITH DRUNKEN DRIVING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An off-duty police officer backed his Chevrolet van
into a Queens liquor store, knocking down part of a wall and
prompting the first confiscation of a vehicle from an officer
accused of drunken driving, police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, James Schmidt, 41, was charged with driving while
intoxicated and his 1986 Chevrolet Suburban was impounded by the
police. The van struck a wall of Leiser's Liquor at the
intersection of Sanford Avenue and 162rd Street in Flushing about
11 p.m. Thursday, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got into his van, it moved backward and crashed into a wall
of a liquor store,'' said Mary DeBourbon, a spokeswoman for the
Queens District Attorney.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting the wall, the officer got out of the van and fell
down, cutting and bruising himself to the extent that he had to be
taken to New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens for treatment,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, who has been on the force since 1997, was suspended
after the incident. The police would not disclose the level of
alcohol in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   The van punched a hole about 10 feet high and 15 feet wide in a
side room, not the liquor store itself, which was closed.
</P>
<P>
   The police began confiscating cars from drivers with a blood
alcohol content greater than 0.10 percent in late February. Through
Thursday, 167 vehicles had been confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Madelyne Colon said the van taken from Schmidt was the
first vehicle confiscated from a police officer under the new laws.

AFTER RAIN, SERENA WILLIAMS POURS IT ON HINGIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. _ The juggernaut went for the jugular Friday
afternoon in the women's semifinals at the Lipton Championships.
Serena Williams, wielding her racquet like a graphite howitzer,
turned her sights on the world's top-ranked player, Martina Hingis,
and throttled her, 6-3, 7-6 (7-3).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never beaten the No. 1. player in the world before, so I
guess this is my biggest victory,'' said Williams, who will face
either her sister, Venus, the Lipton's defending champion, or the
five-time Lipton champion Steffi Graf in Sunday's final.
</P>
<P>
   The 16th-seeded Williams, invincible in 16 consecutive matches,
admitted to harboring a slight preference about the identity of her
final-round opponent. ``If I play Venus, it wouldn't really matter
who won or who lost; the trophy would definitely go to our house,''
said Williams, who is 0-2 against her older sister and 1-1 against
Graf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venus has always been in front, but I guess you could say
we're even now,'' said Williams, indubitably the world's most
confident 16th-ranked player. A final-round confrontation between
the Williams sisters would be the first time that two sisters
butted heads for a title since 19-year-old Maud Watson defeated her
26-year-old sibling, Lillian, in the 1884 Wimbledon final.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's rain-delayed, 1-hour 26-minute power play thrust the
17-year-old Williams into her third straight final. Not since
Hingis, 18, monopolized the scene in 1997 has a teenager wreaked
such sustained insurrection against the rest of her peers on the
WTA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who hasn't lost a match since the thorny third round
of the Australian Open to Sandrine Testud on Jan. 23, captured her
first career title by beating the Australian Open runner-up Amelie
Mauresmo in Paris on Feb. 28 and instantly followed that milestone
by overpowering Graf two weeks ago in the Evert Cup final at Indian
Wells, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's victory, her first demotion of Hingis in three
attempts, brought vindication for the two match points she wasted
against Hingis in their quarterfinal here last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how I felt when I won two, three tournaments in a row;
I was like, `OK, nobody's better than me,''' said Hingis, who saw
that feeling embodied in Williams belting and pelting balls at her
from across the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good time for her, not for me,'' said Hingis, whose
performance suffered from an irregular first serve that rarely hit
80 mph and an anemic second serve that floated over the net like
dandelion fluff and was routinely pounded into oblivion by
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the amply muscled Williams maintained a 100 mph
average on her own first serves and, after a jittery start where
she took 100 mph swipes at all of her ground strokes and turned
most of them to swashbuckling unforced errors, happily settled into
her role as dictator of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things didn't go the way I planned in the beginning,'' said
Williams, ``but I just told myself to fight. I've never given up in
my life. I just don't have that spirit in me. If it was, it's no
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis took a 4-0 lead in the first set, which began three hours
late and was momentarily suspended when sprinkles started falling
three games and nine minutes into what looked initially like a rout
for the Lipton's 1997 champion.
</P>
<P>
   But when Williams finally got her arsenal in order and held for
1-4 with a crafty backhand lob, the match did an about-face and
Hingis dropped eight straight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden I was behind 6-4, and then she was leading 2-0
quite quick: She was always a step faster than me,'' said Hingis,
who found her deficit so insulting that she poured on the precision
and nudged her way to a 5-2 lead in the second set. But closure
there eluded her. She squandered three opportunities to serve for
the second set, and on her second try was robbed of a set point at
5-4 by a non-call on an apparently out-of-bounds forehand return by
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis was angered more by her inability to close out the set on
the chances she had before and after that missed call to blame it
for her misfortunes: ``You definitely don't love it, but it
happens. I should have made it before, and I had another chance
after, big chances and I didn't use them,'' said Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   In the tie breaker, Williams powered her way to her first and
only match point with a backhand blast that glazed the sideline,
and then, at 6-3, snaked a down-the-line forehand past Hingis and
immediately raised both arms in the air to celebrate.
