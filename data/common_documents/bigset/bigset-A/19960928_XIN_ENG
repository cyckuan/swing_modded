<HEADLINE> Trade, Sustainable Development Center Launched in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A special forum was
inaugurated here today with an objective to open up the World
Trade Organization (WTO) to dialogue with non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) and to promote sustainable development within
the area of international trade.
</P>
<P>
The forum, called the International Center for Trade and
Sustainable Development, is designed to support the work of the
Northern and Southern NGOs by easing the access to information and
organizing meetings, seminars and working groups between NGOs or
with members of the international trade community.
</P>
<P>
The center is conducted by Ricardo Melendez Ortiz, Colombia's
former negotiator for the Uruguay Round multilateral trade
negotiations, and is comprised of two panels of experts who are
supposed to make recommendations concerning trade and development.
</P>
<P>
Members of the first panel include Renato Ruggiero, WTO
director general, and Rubens Ricupero, secretary general of the
U.N. Conference on Trade and Development. The second panel gathers
NGOs.
</P>
<P>
The initiative to set up the center comes from NGOs based in
Ecuador, India, Canada, and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
In a press release today, the center said the international
trade flows, totaling over 5 trillion U.S. dollars in 1995, hold
enormous potential to foster or to frustrate sustainable
development. Accompanying these unprecedented increases in world
trade is an increasing marginalization of people living in poverty
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"NGOs' effective participation is imperious for the
construction of an international trade system whose main objective
is the human being and not only the increasing of trade flows,"
the press release said.

<P>
HARARE, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries have
been advized to use modern technology to upgrade their education
systems so that they can participate in the globalization of
education as equals with other nations.
</P>
<P>
U. N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) Director for southern Africa Anderson Shankanga said
today in Bulawayo that technological means of learnings,
including use of television, radio and computers, could help
reduce costs and create uniformity in education delivery.
</P>
<P>
He was officially opening the Zimbabwe International Trade
Fair's education and training exhibition, Scholastica.
</P>
<P>
''Use of audio-lingual, audio-tutorial and audio-visual
methods will help turn around the present situation of education
characterized by ever rising costs, low access levels,
particularly in rural areas and low quality instructions,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
Shankanga said the Scholastica concept has a potential to
contribute to the enhancement of opportunities for children and
entire communities to have access to quality education and
training.
</P>
<P>
''its significance thus goes beyond simply being a trade
promotion event,'' he stressed.

<P>
HARARE, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe republic police
(ZRP) commissioner Augustine Chihuri today assured the nation of
the force's dedication to protect the economy against criminals,
despite being largely ill-equipped.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the police treated all crime as detrimental
to economic development.
</P>
<P>
''Traffic offenses, drug trafficking and any other crimes
including corrupt police details seeking bribes are tantamount to
sabotaging the economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that while police are doing well to combat
general crime they are not fully equipped to deal with commercial
crime because criminals are using sophisticated means.
</P>
<P>
''We are still lagging behind the offenders in sophisticated
commercial crime because we do not have the necessary technology
like computers,'' said Chihuri, adding that the government is
seeking donor assistance to upgrade its crime prevention and
detection system.

HARARE, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government is
preparing a code to prevent discrimination against people
carrying HIV virus, National AIDS Preventive Program Coordinator
Philip Moses said here today.
</P>
<P>
"There should be HIV/AIDS education and awareness in the
working places," said Moses, adding that discrimination would
reduce productivity in work places as most infected workers are
denied a chance to develop themselves through training, said
Moses.
</P>
<P>
"HIV infected workers should be treated the same way with
other employees and there should be no direct pre-employment
medical test for AIDS," he added.
</P>
<P>
An estimated one million people in the southern African
country are infected with HIV, among whom 200,000 have developed
AIDS and about 300 people die every week.

<HEADLINE> China Gives Priority to Building Large Hydropower Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- China will give priority to
developing large hydropower generating equipment, in a bid to meet
the country's demand for large generating sets with a total
capacity of five million kw by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to a source from the Ministry of Power Industry,
China also will develop large pumping and energy-conserving
generating units in the coming five years, which are designed to
serve the Three Gorges power project as well as other gigantic
projects.
</P>
<P>
The source said that China is planning to enhance its
production capacity of large hydropower generating equipment from
the current two million kw to five million kw by the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China will develop the capability to produce four
extra-large generating units, each with a capacity of 700,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
China has set the target of turning out an annual electricity
output of 1.4 trillion kwh and enhancing its installed power
generating capacity to 300 million kw by the end of the century,
and vigorous development of hydroelectric power will help the
country to meet the goal.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, China will first exploit the
hydroelectric power resources in the middle and upper reaches of
the Yellow River, and in the main artery and tributaries of the
Yangtze River, the Hongshui River, the Lancang River and the
Wujiang River.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Breakthrough In Reforming Culture And Arts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- China has made breakthroughs
in reforming its culture and arts sectors this year, and in doing
so has overcome age-old obstacles, an official from the Ministry
of Culture announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Tian Junli, deputy director of the Arts Department of the
ministry, revealed that China has merged its former state-run
artistic troupes, whose systems were based on the planned economy
and had not been reformed for dozens of years, into ten new
troupes.
</P>
<P>
These troupes have attracted leading artists to the country's
ballet, symphony orchestra, opera, Beijing Opera and theatre, and
will make more use of the market-oriented economic system to
maintain their operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The measure is set to protect the first-rate national troupes
by concentrating on our limited money and personnel," Tian said.
</P>
<P>
In order to be accepted into the troupes, more than 1,400
artists were required to undergo a series of examinations in early
September. About 120 had been unemployed as a result of poor
performances, or for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the examination system into the arts sector
is an indication that Chinese artists are preparing to sacrifice a
life of security and will become more competitive.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has adopted a series of measures to help those who
failed the exams and were left unemployeed.
</P>
<P>
A parallel reform will create different, stable channels to
accumulate more money to revive the arts sector. The state will
increase investment, and troupes are encouraged to make money by
providing more high-quality programs.
</P>
<P>
More enterprises have become patrons of artistic troupes. The
state will set forth regulations to encourage the trend, according
to Tian.
</P>
<P>
"The reforms are an indication that a great change has taken
place in the relationship between the state and the artists, as
well as between the troupes and the performers," Tian explained.
</P>
<P>
He added that through the reforms, the arts sector will operate
under a new mechanism that runs in accordance with a market
economy, meets the demands of cultural and ideological progress,
and follows the laws of art itself.
</P>
<P>
Such a powerful artistic reform has been rarely seen since the
founding of the Republic in 1949, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The reform of the state troupes will be followed by reforms in
other troupes around the country, Tian said, as state troupes
serve as models for local ones.
</P>
<P>
China's culture and arts reform was initiated several years ago
when the market economy was introduced. The first phase of the
reform in 1993 promoted high and traditional arts which were
overshadowed by popular songs and beauty contests, according to
Tian.
</P>
<P>
The current reform is not aimed at encouraging the arts to go
into the market in a any comprehensive way -- society and people's
interests must placed first, Tian said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- In a scalding attack,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today totally blamed
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) for inciting the current
Israeli-Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai and other senior military and security heads,
Netanyahu called on PNA leader Yasser Arafat to retore calm in
Palestinian self-rule areas and return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
He denied that no progress had been made in the peace
process, referring to the meetings with Arafat held by him and
other senior leaders, including Mordechai and Foreign Minister
David Levy.
</P>
<P>
"We are continuing toward peace, but in the last couple of
days, the whole structure of peace has been seriously undermined
by the Palestinians," He said.
</P>
<P>
He blasted the PNA for "cynically" manipulating the issue of
Israel's opening an archaeological underground tunnel under the
premises of the Temple Mount in East Jerusalem so as to incite the
Palestinians and the Arab world against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The recent clashes broke out after PNA leader Yasser Arafat
called for widespread protests against the opening of the tunnel,
which Palestinians denounced as a plot to undermine the Temple
Mount, the third holiest place for Moslems. Netanyahu said that
Israel never attempted to undermine the Moslem holy sites.
</P>
<P>
Quoting wounded Israeli soldiers, Netanyahu claimed that it
was the Palestinian police forces who started the shootings,
which have so far taken a death toll of about 70 on both two
sides. Earlier today, he visited the Israeli soldiers wounded in
the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the words by former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, the
first Arab leader to make peace with Israel, Netanyahu called for
"no more war."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu stressed that, while there are certain ups and
downs in the peace process because of frustrations, the peace
march should continue. He said he had spoken with Arafat twice
in the past days to discuss the situation, but he did not reveal
whether any agreement had been reached.
</P>
<P>
He called on Arafat to return to the negotiating table by
keeping their obligations in order to rescue the peace
process. "We must get things back on track. He (Arafat) must give
clear instructions to his security forces to cease the
attacks... He must stop incitement. He must personally intervene
to stop the incitement," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Arafat had great control over the territories,
but "the question is if he has the will (to stop the fighting)."
The participation of Palestinian policemen in the fighting has
aroused question about Arafat's control over his forces.
</P>
<P>
As the efforts from both sides are continuing to calm the
situation, Netanyahu did not rule out the possibility of holding
a tripartite summit with Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two days, bloody clashes have taken a death
toll of about 70 people and about 1,000 others were wounded,
threatening to jeopardize the peace process which is now under
grave danger.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian protesters, mostly stone-throwing teenagers,
bravely confronted well-armed Israeli policemen and border
troops, reminiscent of the scenes of the 1987-1993 intifada, or
Palestinian uprising.

<HEADLINE> hke Brazil Beats Cuba at World Women's Grand Prix Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Brazil edged Cuba 3-2 to win
the highly-charged opener of the World Women's Volleyball Grand
Prix finals here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other match, host China lost to Russia 15-5, 15-12
and 15-7.
</P>
<P>
Brazil opened the match by winning the first two sets 15-7,
15-9 as they disrupted the Cuban reception by powerful services
and forced their opponents into many spiking mistakes.
</P>
<P>
Cuba surged back strongly after strengthening their blocking
with substitute Zolia Barros and drawing the full attackin power
from Regla Torres and Regla Bell, making it 2-2 with 15-9 and 15-7.
</P>
<P>
Ana Sanglard had two blocking points, star setter Fernanda
Venturini added four by spiking to inspire Brazil to snatch the
tie-breaker 15-10, revenging their 3-0 loss at the last
preliminary leg at Taipei last week.
</P>
<P>
But some players from the two teams began to exchange punches
and verbal assaults when it should be the post-match hand-shaking
time.
</P>
<P>
Security personnel of the Shanghai Stadium had to intervene to
seperate the brawling parties. The post-match press conference was
also cancelled.
</P>
<P>
At an Olympic match at Atlanta, Cuban and Brazilian players
also fought on the way to their locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
"Something happened in the Olympics and today's match." said
Brazilian head coach Bernardo Renzende. "This is not good for the
sport."
</P>
<P>
He said the fifth-set victory was mainly thanks to the use of
double and triple blocking at the central part of the net, which
doused many Cuban scoring hopes.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which lost to China in the Olympic semi-final this
summer, dominated throughout Friday's match.
</P>
<P>
An apparently exhausted Chinese team fell easy victims to the
high-point firing power from Russia's ace spikers Elena Godina and
Evguenia Artamonova.
</P>
<P>
They were also unable to overcome the blocking of a high
"Russian Wall".
</P>
<P>
"I'am surprised that we played so poor today," said Chinese
coach Lang Ping, who brough off ace hitter Sun Yue in the opening
set for the first time in almost 13 internationals.
</P>
<P>
"After we lost to Russia in Hong Kong, we had analyzed the
match thoroughly and prepared well. Yes, we are tired but this
doesn't warrant today's loss. We also had problems with setters."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, China meets Brazil and Cuba faces Russia.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Criticizes Unfair Practices of North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Prime
Minister Mahathier Bin Mohamad today severely criticized the
Northern states for taking advantage of the globalization to
reduce their commitments.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the general debate of the 51st session of the U.N.
General Assembly, Mahathier said now that the concept of globalism
is so intimately linked with international trade, it is important
to critically examine the realities of the so-called "free trade."
</P>
<P>
The painfully long history of the Uruguay Round negotiations
"should have forewarned us" that the World Trade Organization,
although established as a rules-based multilateral organization to
regulate international trade, will become answerable only to the
world's wealthiest economic powers, he said.
</P>
<P>
"During the Uruguay Round, the developing countries discovered
that instead of negotiating international rules on trade in
manufactured goods, the rich countries of the North had widened
the agenda and pushed for liberalization in economic areas where
they clearly have an advantage, in particular the financial
services and investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Even though some countries of the South have benefited from
the liberalization of trade, and Malaysia is one of them, the GATT
agreement nevertheless harbors new threats to developing and newly
emerging economies," he added.
</P>
<P>
Not only have the poor countries of the South to struggle
uphill merely to meet the basic needs of their peoples, but they
are now bullied to adjusting their economic policies to meet their
new obligations under the GATT so that Northern-based corporations
can penetrate and capture their markets.
</P>
<P>
The attempt to link the environment and labor standards to
trade in manufactured goods is a clear attempt to deny developing
countries their meager competitive advantage, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The relationship between trade and labor standards emerged not
because of a concern for the well-being of workers in the poor
countries, but as protectionist moves aimed against growing and
competitively-priced imports from the South," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
When it comes to technology transfer, the Northern countries
take a fiercely anti-liberal stand, insisting that all WTO member
states compulsorily introduce a set of national laws to protect
intellectual property rights, which means legal protection of
their technological monopoly and curtailing the right of the
developing countries to have access to new technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that many poor countries are saddled with an
unsustainable level of debt -- the poor countries had to spend
more on debt servicing than on financing basic programs for
health care, education and humanitarian relief.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques
Chirac, Germany Chancellor Helmut Kohl and British Prime Minister
John Major today jointly made a "solemn" appeal to Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
to meet immediately.
</P>
<P>
A French presidential spokesperson said that the three leaders
told Netanyahu and Arafat in two separate letters that they
"strongly hope for an immediate resumption of negotiations at the
highest level" and "in accordance with the ways agreed upon by the
two sides."
</P>
<P>
"This negotiation should be the occasion to examine all the
subjects in suspense. It should also allow the complete
application of the signed agreements, and open the perspective of
signing an agreement on the final status of the Palestinian
territories," said the letters.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders stressed that this "appears to them the only
step to bring back a lasting calmness in the Palestinian
territories and to ensure the security of Israel."
</P>
<P>
They also called on both sides to show reason and take up their
responsibility for ending the conflicts which have been going on
for three days and have caused the death of some 80 people.
</P>
<P>
"We know that your attachment to the pursuit of the peace
process will guide you to do all you can to let wisdom and reason
prevail," said the three leaders in their letter to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"We count on your authority and your vision as a man of state
to let wisdom and peace prevail, in the interests of all the
peoples of the region," they said in their letter to Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> Traditional Family Declines in Britain: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The long-term decline of
traditional family of married couple with children and the growth
of lone-parent households have accelerated during recent years,
according to a report by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
The report, published Thursday in Population Trends, the
quarterly ONS journal, said that growth of individualism and
increasing exercise of choice about how people live is leading to
the acceptance of "a variety of norms" of household composition.
</P>
<P>
After adjusting for population size, the marriage rate is shown
to have more than halved since 1971 from 69 per 1,000 unmarried
people over 16 to 33.8 in 1994, the ONS said.
</P>
<P>
There was more than one divorce for every two marriages in
1994, 158,200 against 291,100, and the divorce rate of 13.4 per
1,000 married people compared to 5.9 in 1971.
</P>
<P>
While fewer people are marrying and staying married, more are
cohabiting or opting to live on their own. More parents are
raising children single-handedly, but more women, too, are
choosing to remain childless.
</P>
<P>
The report revealed that in 1986, 83 percent of families with
or without children were headed by married couples, but by 1994,
that figure had fallen to 71 percent.
</P>
<P>
Only 56 percent of men and women aged 18-49 were part of a
married couple in 1994, down from 62 percent in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Growing numbers of people live alone. More than a quarter of
all households are now one-person homes, representing more than 6
million people.
</P>
<P>
The average number of children in a family dropped from 2.0 in
1971 to 1.8 in 1994. Not enought children are being born to
replace the number dying and the population will start to fall
within 20 years, the report said.

ADDIS ABABA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Health
Minister Adem Ibrahim said today a study to improve the salary of
health professionals has been concluded and was welcomed by the
Civil Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Ethiopian News Agency, Adem said the existing
salaries of health workers in government-owned health
institutions are lower than they should be, adding that the bill
will soon be referred to the Council of Ministers for approval.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that more studies are being conducted to
boost the capacity of Ethiopia's under-equipped health
institutions through the installation of new equipment and
training of manpower.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the current trends of the desertion of
professionals in government-owned health institutions in favour
of better pays in privately-owned health institutions, Adem said
that it was up to the workers to choose where to work, and that
the government holds both sectors with equal esteem. enditem

<TEXT>

JERUSALEM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat has called on Israel to resume peace
talks between the two sides as the Israeli-Palestinian relations
sank to an unprecedented low level due to bloody conflicts in the
past three days, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the call while speaking to reporters after Friday
prayer in a Gaza mosque. He noted that peace process is the only
way to end bloodshed over the last three days.
</P>
<P>
At least eight people, including six Palestinians, were killed
and over 200 wounded in the third day of Israeli-Palestinian
bloodshed which spread to Jerusalem today.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman today telephoned Arafat, asking
him to do everything in his capacity to calm down the tensions.
</P>
<P>
Arafat stressed his commitment to the peace process and
promised not to allow peace to be halted, according to Weizman.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Sarid, leader of the left Meretz Party, called on
Arafat in Gaza today in a bid to mediate the relations
between the PA and Israel's Likud government.
</P>
<P>
Sarid, who was environment minister of the former Labor
government and one of the key negotiators with the PLO, said
that Arafat was making every effort to restore tranquility.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, just as Israel could not always control
situation in every location, Arafat has difficulty in ending
violence.

JERUSALEM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- At least eight people,
including six Palestinians, were killed and over 200 wounded in
the third day of Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed which spread
to Jerusalem today.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Stone-throwing Palestinian Moslems clashed with
Israeli security forces in the Temple Mount area just after the
noon prayers ended. At least two Palestinians were killed and
about 125 others wounded as Israeli policemen stormed the
Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, firing rubber bullets and tear gas to
disperse them.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said the live ammunitions were also used,
although Israeli government said that the security forces had
been given strict order not to use them.
</P>
<P>
About 20 Israeli policemen were also wounded by flying stones
and bottles. However, security forces managed to restore calm in
the area after about an hour of riots. Witnesses said that elder
Moslems turned back some youths who intended to march into the
central city area.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Arabs observed a partial strike today to show
solidarity with the Palestinian protesters. About dozens of
protester were detained by the police in demonstrations in
several communities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two Israeli border policemen were killed in
sproadic clashes in a comparatively calm day across the
Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the scene
of the worst bloodshed in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli soldiers were killed and 10 others wounded in the
West Bank town of Tulkarm, as Palestinian security forces opened
fire as the Israeli soldiers tried to ward off thousands of
Palestinian demonstrators. Israeli tanks have been sent to the
area to protect the safety of several Jewish settlements. One
Palestinian was reportedly killed.
</P>
<P>
One Israeli soldier was seriously wounded in riots in Jenin and
later sent to a hospital in Haifa. Two other Israeli soldiers were
wounded in clashes in Qalqilya and Jericho.
</P>
<P>
Fierce clashes erupted in Jericho, as three Palestinians were
killed and 25 others wounded in the conflict. Moreover, 40
Palestinians were wounded in Qalqilya; 12 in Ramallah, the place
of the first shot was fired; another 12 in Bethelem, 12 kilometers
south of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
No major casualties were reported in Gaza Strip today though
Palestinian protesters stoned Israeli positions near the Erez
Crossing point. Media reports said Palestinian police tried to
disperse the demonstrations in order to prevent further bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Israel has declared the Palestinian territories as closed
military zone to Israelis, while security forces have been
greatly beefed up along the green line.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his military
and security heads have ordered Israeli soldiers to take all
necessary means to protect Israeli civilians and themselves in
the territories.

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Int'l Economic Relations Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador
Wang Xuexian, on behalf of Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen, today urged establishment of a new type of international
economic relations of mutual benefit, complementarity and common
development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 20th annual meeting of foreign ministers from
the Group of 77, Wang said that the process of global integration
is accelerating, but the gap between the developed and developing
countries on the whole continues to widen.
</P>
<P>
The economic situation of Africa and the least developed
countries is especially grim and the trend of their being
marginalized is further growing, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Unfair and inequitable international economic relations
continue to exist with the decision-making power in the world
economic affairs still in the hands of a few developed countries,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Some developed countries are trying every possible means to
shirk their responsibilities and obligations in international
development cooperation, bringing such cooperation to a
standstill," he said.
</P>
<P>
The external economic environment continues to deteriorate, as
characterized by decreasing official development assistance and
growing trade protectionism, he said.
</P>
<P>
All this is seriously hampering or even offsetting the efforts
by developing countries for economic and social development, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the joint efforts of the Group of 77 today are all
the more necessary for the establishment of a new type of
international economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the Chinese government attaches great importance to
the positive role played by the Group of 77 in the multilateral
economic field. China is ready to further strengthen unity and
cooperation with the Group of 77 so as to meet the new challenges
ahead, he said.

<HEADLINE> UN Seeks 39.9 Mln Dlrs for Emergency Aid to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is
appealing for 39.9 million dollars to meet the most essential
needs of the vulnerable population of Iraq for the next three
months.
</P>
<P>
The program sets out the emergency requirements for assistance
until the oil-for-food formula is implemented, according to the
U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA).
</P>
<P>
The majority of the Iraqi population is believed to be living
below the poverty line. The cumulative effects of six-year economic
sanctions, hyper-inflation, unemployment and a 30-percent drop of
crop production this year have led to a disquieting level of
hardship.
</P>
<P>
Recent hostilities in the north have further exacerbated an
already dismal humanitarian situation throughout Iraq: an
estimated 200,000 people have been displaced, an additional 39,000
people have sought refuge in Iran, schools, hospitals, water and
sanitations systems have been looted and vaccine and medicines
rendered unusable.
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition is rampant and fewer than 50 percent of children
and women are receiving more than half their calorific needs, the
DHA reported.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Addis Ababa Glass
Factory plans to install modern machineries enabling it to
increase output by 33 percent, the factory's General Manager said
today.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of the factory Nigussie Erkuta said the
factory has purchased glass works and melting machineries at a
cost of about three million U.S.Dollars and the installation will
commence in November this year.
</P>
<P>
He said beginning February next year, the factory will start
producing glasses that are useful for bootling medicinal drugs
and marmalade, and new brands of beer glasses.
</P>
<P>
The capacity of the factory, he said, which used to produce
60,000 glasses a day, will be lifted to 80,000 with the
installation of the new machineries.
</P>
<P>
The increase of production of the factory will minimize the
country's foreign exchange expenditure on imported
glasses,Nigussie Erkuta noted.
</P>
<P>
The Addis Ababa Glass Factory gets 97 percent of the raw
materials it use from the local market. During the last fiscal
year, it produced 5,552 tons of glasses, 1,152 tons more than the
target it set, earning a profit of 590,000 U.S.Dollars.

<HEADLINE> AL Official Calls for Netanyahu's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Assistant Secretary General of the
Arab League (AL) for the Palestine Affairs Saeed Kamal asked today
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign and give the
reins of government to Israeli President Ezer Weizman.
</P>
<P>
"Such an action is necessary for stopping the bloodshed between
the Palestinians and the Israelis," the Egyptian Middle East News
Agency (MENA) quoted Kamal as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that the suggestion was aimed at avoiding any further
deterioration of the Middle East peace process which has been
stalled since Netanyahu took office in June.
</P>
<P>
The current clashes, triggered by Israel's opening of a
controversial tunnel in east Jerusalem Tuesday, constitute an
explosion of accumulated frustration caused by the policies,
maneuvers and procrastinations of Netanyahu's regime in dealing
with the peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
The AL is following up closely the developments of the
situation in the Palestinian territories and in contact with
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
He said he urged Netanyahu to step down before deciding any
move in line with the June Cairo Arab summit and Thursday's AL
emergency meeting on the Aqsa Mosque, Kamal pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The AL official affirmed that efforts were under way to hold an
tripartite summit meeting between President Hosni Mubarak,
Netanyahu and Arafat here.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Egypt's firm stance on establishing a "real, just
and comprehensive peace" in the region, guaranteeing peace and
security for all countries in the region including Israel and the
founding of a Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Chief Foresees Debt Relief Agreement Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- James Wolfensohn,
President of the World Bank Group indicated here today that the
international community was near agreement on a debt relief plan
for poor countries.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn told a press conference prior to the World
Bank-International Monetary Fund (IMF) joint annual meeting that he
expected the first cases to be dealt with by yearend.
</P>
<P>
"I think we're very close to reaching a positive and productive
agreement that will allow us to proceed immediately on specific
cases," he told the crowded press conference.
</P>
<P>
However, the World Bank chief also noted that details remain to
be worked out, and that the Paris Club of creditor nations have
not yet announced their specifics part of the debt relief plan.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and World Bank have called for the Paris Club to
forgive some 90 percent of loans, but Wolfensohn said it would be
less than that. "I don't know if it's 80 percent but it certainly
not going to be 90 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there appears to be consensus emerging in
the Paris Club to offer debt relief of up to 80 percent on a
case-by-case basis. It currently provides relief of up to 67
percent under so-called Naples terms.
</P>
<P>
The debt-reduction was a major issue during the World Bank-IMF
spring meeting in April and is likely on the top of agenda for the
joint annual meeting. To provide debt relief is not just from
Paris Club's creditor nations but also from the IMF and World Bank
these two largest multilateral financial institutions, whose loans
to poor countries have themselves become a problem.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks, Wolfensohn said the Bank had already committed
some 500 million U.S. dollars to the proposed concert effort and
he was prepared to recommend that a total 2 billion dollars be
pledged in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
The Paris Club has already indicated that it is willing to
improve debt relief to very poor countries provided the IMF and
World Bank themselves do their own share in helping them.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's plan to sell a part of its gold stock to help fund
its debt-reduction program and finance its existing enhanced
structural adjustment facility (ESAF) has stirred up controversy.
The sale of gold has been strongly opposed by Germany which wins
support from Italy and Switzerland. But IMF Managing Director
Michel Camdessus made clear during another press conference on
Thursday that while the program was a "done deal," the gold sales
would only be considered if funding by donor countries, the World
Bank and the Fund itself fell short.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Group of Seven rich nations agreed at a summit
held in Lyon, France, last June that debt relief should be
improved for the world's poorest nations, with the Paris Club, IMF
and World Bank all playing a role. G7 finance ministers from the
United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada
are expected to discuss the debt plan when they meet on Saturday.

CAIRO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat is sparing no efforts to mollify conditions in the
Palestinian lands and resume peace negotiations with Israel, an
Israeli opposition party representative said in Gaza today.
</P>
<P>
Yussi Sarid, the representative of Israel's opposition Meretz
Party, made the remarks after his meeting with Arafat in Gaza,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Sarid said the situation in Jerusalem's Al Aqsa Mosque was
tragic and that all parties concerned must work to stop fire.
</P>
<P>
Arafat thanked Sarid for his visit and stance vis-a-vis the
peace process, adding that he had a phone call with Israeli
President Ezer Weizman on the ongoing conditions and the
necessity of settling the groundwork for resuming negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Moslem worshipers fought Israeli police at one of Islam's
holiest shrines today in a fourth day of violence across the
Palestinian self-rule areas -- the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The violence was the latest to erupt in the wake of Israeli
hardline Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to open a
tunnel under the Al Aqsa Mosque compound.
</P>
<P>
Since the opening of the tunnel Tuesday, 56 Palestinians and
14 Israelis have died in the clashes.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Develop Test to Detect Mad Cow Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. researchers created
the first reliable test for mad cow disease and its human
counterpart, The Wall Street Journal reported the discovery that
could help prevent the spread of the deadly brain disorders.
</P>
<P>
It isn't known when commercial versions of the test, which was
developed by scientists at California Institute of Technology and
the National Institutes of Health, will be available, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the test which uses antibodies to detect the presence
of a characteristic protein found in the spinal fluid of those
with the diseases, is simple enough to be performed now by any
well-equipped public health laboratory, the paper quoted one
researcher as saying.
</P>
<P>
In humans, the experimental test could allow doctors to detect
the presence while patients are still alive of so-called
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which has symptoms similar to
Alzheimer's disease. Previously, the disease could only be
verified through a brain biopsy after death.
</P>
<P>
Scientists could also use the test in the future to see whether
cows or other animals with brain disorders actually have mad cow
disease, or just a noncontagious disorder with similar symptoms.
Currently, one-third of animals slaughtered because they are
suspected of having mad cow disease turn out not to have the
disease.
</P>
<P>
The paper also mentioned that the test is far from perfect.
</P>
<P>
For example, it can only detect the disease in animals or
humans that have developed symptoms, even though it is believed
that humans and animals may be infected for many years without any
signs.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the researchers are still verifying whether the test
works for different variants of mad cow disease, including a
particular English strain. They expect to have these results in
several months.

WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Challenging Republican
rival Bob Dole, U.S. President Bill Clinton is hoping to become
the first Democrat since Jimmy Carter to capture the Texas.
</P>
<P>
"We can win in the state of Texas!" The Associated Press quoted
Clinton as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Dole campaign said Clinton's record was a far cry from what
Texans wants.
</P>
<P>
"They say Texans like things big, but I don't think they'll
take a shine to Bill Clinton's big liberal, big spending, big
government ways," spokeswoman Christine Martin said.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Clinton lost Texas and its 32 electoral votes to
George Bush by 4 percentage points, with Texas businessman Ross
Perot drawing 22 percent of the vote. Perot siphoned more votes
from Bush than Clinton.
</P>

Clinton showed confidence about his prospects this time,
reminding supporters in Fort Worth: "Four years ago, I had a

<HEADLINE> U.S. tells Israel, Palestinians to End Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States warned
both Israel and the Palestinians on Friday that they must stop
violence as the fierce clashes between the Israelis and the
Palestinians entered into its third consecutive day, leading to
more than 50 killed and more than one hundred wounded.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is working very hard this morning, very
intensive, to try to convince the Israelis and Palestinians to
step back from the violence," State Department spokesman Nicholas
Burns said in New York.
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. officials were keeping up furious telephone
diplomacy with the region in an attempt to advise Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palistinian leader Yasser Arafat
back to peace negotiations table and put out the flame of
violence, ignited by the opening of a tunnel under the authority
of Netanyahu near Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of the holiest Islamic site
in Jerusalem. which Arafat said is a "big crime".
</P>
<P>
"Our message this morning to the populations in the West Bank,
In Gaza, in Jerusalem and in Israel is that the violence must
stop, that peace cannot be achieved in the street, it will not be
won in the street," said Burns who is accompanying Christopher
attending the U.N. General Assembly. "They have to turn their
attention, turn their historical enmities and arguments and issues
unresolved from the peace negotiations, back to the negotiating
table."
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who has been consulting with Middle East diplomats
on the fringes of the annual U.N. General Assembly and spoken
twice with Netanyahu, proposed to Israeli officials on Thursday
that the tunnel be closed so that tensions could be eased.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu initially rejected the idea, saying he would not
bend under violent pressure tactics from the Palestinians. But
pressures from all fronts have finally forced him to decide to
shut the tunnel down for the day for the Muslim and Jewish
religious holidays.
</P>
<P>
The United States welcomed the temporary closure of the tunnel
and Burns said: "We hope at least a temporary closing of the
tunnel might lessen the tensions that are so evident."
</P>
<P>
Burns said the U.S. aim was to convince the Israelis and the
Palestinians that a meeting must be arranged between Netanyahu and
Arafat "or between their advisers".
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Washington has offered Christopher's help
in brokering an end to the tunnel crisis, and the secretary of
state has suggested to Netanyahu that he travel to the region for
that purpose. But the Israeli leader rejected his suggestion,
telling him that he was not predisposed to meet with anyone
including Arafat until the violence stopped.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has yet to speak directly with any
leaders in the Middle East. His spokesman Mike McCurry said the
president would only get involved for "a specific purpose" and has
delegated the sensitive issue to Christopher.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no recommendation that he get directly involved
in the Middle East peace process," McCurry told reporters in Texas
where Clinton is on a campaign trip stop. "The president is
satisfied that we are advancing everything we can advance through
diplomatic channels."

briefed Ghali on the latest developments in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahaf held several meetings with foreign ministers of other
countries on the fringe of the U.N. General Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
The meetings dealt with the situation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller, al-Sahaf reaffirmed his country's
categorical refusal of the Turkish plans to establish a security
zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, however, discussed the creation of an oil
pipe line to convey the Iraqi oil through Turkish territories.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed Turkey's right to use Article 50 of the
U.N. Charter to contain the damages which Turkey is undergoing
due to the U.N.-imposed embargo on Iraq, INA added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed the embargo on Iraq following its August 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the world organization signed an agreement on May 20,
which will allow Iraq to sell 1 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil
every three months to buy food and medicine to reduce the
sufferings of its people.
</P>
<P>
After the Iraqi government sent troops to a Kurdish "safe
haven" in the north to intervene in Kurdish factional strife in
late August, U.N. Secretary General Ghali announced on September
1 he was delaying deployment of U.N. personnel to implement the
oil-for-food deal with Iraq.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Brazil scored a hard-fought
3-2 victory Saturday over China to remain unbeaten at the
four-team World Women's Volleyball Grand Prix finals.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, the third-placer at the Atlanta Olympics this summer,
battled two hours 20 minutes before winning 13-15, 15-11, 15-5,
15-17 and 15-9 over the Olympic runner-up.
</P>
<P>
In another marathon match Saturday, Olympic champion Cuba
rallied from a two-set down to outspike Russia 13-15, 8-15, 15-9,
15-6 and 17-15.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, who edged Cuba 3-2 in its first match Friday, raced to
a 5-0 lead in the first set but could not stop a strong Chinese
comeback that levelled the score at 6-6.
</P>
<P>
The two sides tied five times from 9-9 until 13-13 before Li
Yan and captain Lai Yawen each spiked one point to help China take
the set.
</P>
<P>
Leila Barros and Virna Dias scored most points as Brazil
rallied to take the second and third sets.
</P>
<P>
Under the vigorous vocal support from a 8,0000-strong home
crowd, China beefed up defense and performed well on service in a
close fifth set, where it was never behind.
</P>
<P>
After Barros's spike drew the score at 15-15, China's Wang
Ziling responded with a brisk smash and then Dias drove too long
to end the match 17-15.
</P>
<P>
In the tie-breaker, Brazil built a 10-5 lead and enver looked
back in the rest of the set. Barros sealed the Brazilian victory
with a cross-court smash.
</P>
<P>
Barros led the Brazilian scorers with 16 points, followed by
Dais's 12 and Ana Moser's 11.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we played the best match today," said Brazilian
coach Bernardo Rezende. "After all, I have a weaker line-up with
two players suspended and so many young players."
</P>
<P>
Brazilian players Ana Connerly and Ericleia Bodziar, along with
Cuban stars Relga Bell and Relga Torres, were suspened following
their punching each other after their Friday clash.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Lang Ping said, "We did try our best. But we
failed to grasp the good opportunity in the seocnd set. We still
need improvement on technics, especially on blocking. Our setter
also did not distribute the ball smartly."
</P>
<P>
Without Bell and Torres, Cuba relied heavily on new spiking
talents Ana Valle Fernandez and Mirka Francia, who respectively
had 13 and 12 points.
</P>
<P>
Cuba coach Antonio Perdomo appolozied for Friday's brawl.
</P>
<P>
He said Bell and Torres' suspension also had pyschological
effects on players, which accounted partly for the loss in the
first two sets.
</P>
<P>
Russian coach Nikolai Karpol said his team was poor both in
blocking and defense.
</P>
<P>
Brazil collected four points from two wins to lead the finals
standings, followed by Russia and Cuba who both had three points
from 1-1. Winless China was at bottome with two defeats.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the last day of the finals, China faces Cuba while
Russia meets Brazil.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban Militia
is introducing strict Islamic rule in the capital of Kabul,
banning women in public working places in particular, said a
report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban today announced on Radio Kabul that all the working
women should stay at home until further notice.
</P>
<P>
"If women step outside their homes, they should have their
faces totally covered," the Radio added.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban also asked women to wear "hejab", an Islamic code
of dress which covers the whole body, in public.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mullah Mohammad Rabbani, the head of the six-member
Taliban interim council in Kabul, said today that Islam recognizes
the right of education for women.
</P>
<P>
However, the fate of a large number of well-trained female
teachers, doctors and nurses in Kabul is still not clear so far.
</P>
<P>
The Radio also announced that drug-users and adulterers would
be stoned to death and all types of narcotics, heroin, and alcohol
were banned.
</P>
<P>
"People will get justice and there will be no crimes, no
plunder, no looting," Mullah Rabbani said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban declared that any government property in private
hands must be returned as soon as possible to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban took complete control of Kabul early Friday
morning, driving the troops loyal to President Burhanuddin Rabbani
out of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Now, the situation in Kabul was calm and public transport was
again running normally.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Rabbani's troops retreated to the north
and were regrouping at Charikar, about 65 kilometers north of
Kabul.
</P>
<P>
However, another unconfirmed report said that Charikar fell to
the Taliban today.

<HEADLINE> Delayed Implementation of Oil-for-Food Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September, 28 (Xinhua) -- Any delay in implementing
the oil-for-food memorandum of understanding between Iraq and the
United Nations will lead to further aggravation of the
humanitarian situation in Iraq, a U.N. official has warned.
</P>
<P>
The warning came in a press release made by United Nations
General Coordinator of the Humanitarian Programs Gualtebro
Folkebri and carried by the local daily Al-Gomhuria today.
</P>
<P>
Folkebri cited official reports compiled by the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization, as
well as other U.N. bodies to shed light on the deteriorating
health and nutrition conditions in Iraq due to the six-year-old
embargo on the country.
</P>
<P>
Political and economic sanctions have been imposed on Iraq by
the United Nations following the 1990-91 Gulf War to drive Iraqi
troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
About half of the hospitalized children suffer much from
malnutrition, and the rest suffer ordinary diseases that can not
be cured because of the acute medicine shortage, the U.N. official
said.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that the postponement of carrying out the
U.N.-Iraq oil-for-food deal will create a serious crisis in the
humanitarian situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum of understanding was signed between Iraq and the
U.N. Security Council this May which allows Iraq to sell in 90
days 1 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil to buy food and
medicine for its suffering people.
</P>
<P>
But the plan has not yet taken effect so far due to the
latest rounds of confrontation between Iraq and the U.S. early this
month.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., which fired dozens of cruise missiles at targets in
southern Iraq on September 3 and 4 after Baghdad sent troops to
help a Kurdish faction in the north, blocked the deal long
cherished by the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has, according to
Folkebri, exerted remarkable efforts to put the memorandum of
understanding in force and he is still seeking an early solution
to the "technical problems" that hamper the implementation.
</P>
<P>
Debates are under way at the U.N. headquarters in New York, on
ways and the time of implementing the oil-for-food formula and the
functions of the U.N. monitors as well as other technical issues,
Folkebri added.
</P>
<P>
The visiting U.N. general coordinator is inspecting the
situation in the northern Iraqi city of Irbil today. His agenda
was unknown.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly denounced Washington for creating obstacles
to the implementation of the deal and asked the U.N. chief to step
in and pave the way.

Thursday.
</P>

opposition leader and said that such meetings would help remove
misunderstandings and strengthen democracy.
</P>

reference to the Supreme Court last week regarding prime
minister's role in the appointment of judges, president's message
to the parliament on eliminating corruption and implementation of
the Supreme Court judgment on March 20 on the appointment of
judges.
</P>
<P>
Benazir said that the government agreed to the spirit of the
president's message to the parliament. As regards the Supreme
Court judgment, it was observed that the judgment was being
implemented.
</P>
<P>
They will meet again after the prime minister's visit to the
United States, the handout said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also had lunch with the president, the
handout added.
</P>
<P>
Recent rumors said the president and the prime minister have
developed differences between each other and the two leaders did
not have any official meeting for more than one month, which is
unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the two top leaders is expected to clear
such rumors.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Chen Ziying, vice-director of
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, met
today with a group of Hong Kong education workers, saying that the

of Education Workers, the 23-member group was in Beijing to attend
National Day celebrations.
</P>

Educational development policies to be designed by the
government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
will be based on the original educational system, which, including
student recruitment, will remain unchanged, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said this move demonstrates the "one country, two systems"
policy to be implemented in Hong Kong after 1997 is a long-term
one.
</P>
<P>
The central government has repeatedly stressed that no
provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions or government
departments can interfere in the affairs that the Hong Kong SAR
government administers on its own, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers
for its work to unite the education workers, protect their rights
and promote educational exchanges between China's inland areas and
Hong Kong, hoping people in the educational circles of Hong Kong
will contribute more to the smooth transition in Hong Kong.

<P>
Shanghai, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The piloting for vessels
sailing between Shanghai Port and Yangtze River will be changed in
line with international practice, Lin Yu, director of
Communications Ministry Maritime Safety Administration, announced
here today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has decided that the piloting will be conducted
during sailing of the vessels, instead of the previous practice of

</P>
<P>
The new system will go into effect on a trial basis between
October 1-17 and will begin officially on October 18.
</P>

Local navigational experts observed that the new rule will help
improve the traffic on the Yangtze River, as the new piloting
method will shorten travel time.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 19,000 ships were piloted by Shanghai Harbor Pilotage
Administration Station, and this year, the figure is expected to
surpass 20,000.

<HEADLINE> Chen Muhua on Women's Contribution to HK and Macao's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Women in China's inland
areas, Hong Kong and Macao should unite to ensure the prosperity
and stability of Hong Kong and Macao as well as the smooth
transition, said a senior Chinese official today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Chen Muhua, vice-chairwoman of the National People's Congress
Standing Committee and president of the All-China Women's
Federation, said at a women's meeting today that to resume the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao and realize the
reunification of the motherland is the goal of the Chinese people
generation after generation.
</P>
<P>
Under the framework of "one country, two systems" designed by
Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese government signed joint declarations
with Britain and Portugal on the issue of Hong Kong and Macao,
she added.
</P>
<P>
"To resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao
is significant both in the history of China and the world. It is
also a milestone in realizing the reunification of the
motherland," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Chen praised women in Hong Kong and Macao for their
contributions to the development of the two regions, under the
banner of patriotism.
</P>
<P>
She quoted Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who said that Hong
Kong's prosperity is mainly created by the Hong Kong people, while
being backed by the reform and opening up and economic development
in China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Such progress "also contains the wisdom and initiative of the
women in Hong Kong and Macao," she said.
</P>
<P>
Women in China's inland areas and their organizations have
always had great regard for women in Hong Kong and Macao, while
women in those two regions have followed closely the construction
and development of the motherland, and have contributed to the
promotion of economic and cultural exchanges between the inland
areas and Hong Kong and Macao, she said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said she believes that all people in Hong Kong and Macao
will have the power to create new wonders after the two regions
return to the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Some 40 Arrested for Illegal Dollar Trading in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Forty-one people were arrested
for illegal foreign exchange trading in the black market in
Iran's capital of Tehran, a press report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Abrar reported that the Law Enforcement
Forces arrested the dollar dealers in Tehran's financial center
located in the vicinity of Ferdowsi Avenue.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not specify what time these foreign
exchange dealers were arrested. But, it added that they were
surrendered to the judicial branch for incarceration or
punishment.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted an official from the Law Enforcement Forces
as saying that agents had arrested two passengers in east Tehran
when they were making preparation to travel to the north. The
passengers were in illegal possession of foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
In May last year, the Iranian money market was brought into a
great turmoil. Foreign hard currencies jumped so sharply that
they pushed up the prices of all commodities.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Iranian authorities have taken resolute
measures including capital punishment to deal with the profiteers
and other economic offenders.
</P>
<P>
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani ordered to clamp down on
illegal trading of foreign currencies throughout the country and
also on smuggling of goods.
</P>
<P>
Despite the capital punishment, the black markets still exist
in the Iranian capital and other cities because most of the
official money exchange centers have been closed.

MADRID, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Primo Nebiolo, the president
of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, is intending to
ban marathons which conflicted with IAAF-organized events.
</P>
<P>
Nebiolo Saturday said in Palma that from next year IAAF would
protect some events. "This is the last time there will be
competitions on the same day as an IAAF world championship," he
said before Sunday's World Half Marathon in Palma.
</P>
<P>
The announcement is likely to upset organizers of some
well-known independent city marathons.

Kenya's Paul Tergat, the holder of the world best for the half
marathon, will compete over the same distance in Luxembourg while
the Berlin Marathon has attracted the likes of Spain's Abel Anton
and Kenya's Sammy Lelei.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF road running commission and the Association of
International Marathons are due to meet in Dublin on October 10
but Saturday's announcement will increase the strain between the
bodies.

PHNOM PENH, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The National United Front
for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful and Unificative Cambodia
(FUNCIPEC) today voiced support of Noroudom Sirivudh's proposed
request of amnesty from King Noroudom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
FUNCIPEC's President Noroudom Ranariddh, who is also first
prime minister of the Cambodian government, told reporters
that if Sirivudh presents his written letter to the King to
request amnesty, FUNCIPEC will fully support him.
</P>
<P>
A plenary meeting of FUNCIPEC National Council has discussed
issues relating to exiled Sirivudh in France, who was former
deputy prime minister and foreign minister of the Royal
Government, said the president.
</P>
<P>
Sirivudh, former FUNCIPEC general secretary, left Cambodia for
exile in France on December 21, 1995, on charges of plotting to
assassinate Second Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with a local newspaper, Ranariddh said
that Sirivudh did not kill anybody, and is still a member of the
National Assembly, so his case is less complicated than that of
Ieng Sary, who gained amnesty from the King on September 14 this
year.

JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Under desperate pressure
from the U.S. for a summit to calm down tensions between Israelis
and Palestinians, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat have so far failed
to agree on a date and venue.
</P>
<P>
Israel is reportedly pushing for a bilateral meeting perhaps
this evening on the border between Gaza and Israel while
Palestinians are looking for a tripartite gathering in Cairo
under the auspices of President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters in Gaza this morning whether he would go to
cairo for the three-way summit, the Palestinian leader replied
that if Netanyahu goes to Cairo he will also go there. But
Israelis responded that is not the option. They want a bilateral
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Today there have been reports on sporadic incidents in the
Gaza Strip and West Bank including East Jerusalem. An Israeli
soldier was lightly injured in an stone-throwing incident at a
checkpoint leading to the Jewish settlement of Kfar Darom in the
Gaza Strip this morning.
</P>
<P>
Several thousands of Palestinian demonstrators attempting to
march toward Erez Checkpoint on the Gaza-Israeli border were
turned back by Palestinian police. Angry protesters were also
prevented from marching to Israeli army checkpoints in Ramallah
and Qalqilya, scenes of bloody confrontation in the past three
days.
</P>
<P>
In East Jerusalem minor clashes took place between
stone-throwers and Israeli police. Palestinian residents burned
tyres and hurled rocks at Jewish homes in Jewish
neighborhoods.

<HEADLINE> Momoh Complains About Confiscation of Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Former president Joseph
Momoh today reacted angrily to the government decision to seize
22 vehicles and 18 houses and farms from him.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Cross which reviewed the various findings of the
National Commission for Unity and Reconciliation, had recommended
that the properties belonging to Momoh be confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Momoh, who was ousted in 1992 in a military coup, said in a
telephone interview from neighboring Guinea, ''it is unfair for
anyone to conclude that all I had was illegally acquired.''
</P>
<P>
''There were many properties that i got through my own labor.
Why should the government take it all,'' he complained.
</P>
<P>
However, the reviewed commission said in a report, ''Momoh
maintained a standard of living above that which was
incommensurate with his past official emoluments.''
</P>
<P>
There was ''evidence of corruption, dishonesty and abuse of
office for private by him,'' the report charged.
</P>
<P>
''Momoh appeared to treat Sierra Leone as his personal freedom
and felt that he was at liberty to act as if its finances were at
his disposal no matter what contrary advice was tendered.''
</P>
<P>
The report singled out a Belgium based firm, Messrs Arzoni
which was given 295 million U.S. Dollars to supply uniforms to
the army and police in a contract signed by Momoh, in 1991. But
''no uniform was supplied,'' it charged.
</P>
<P>
Justice Cross, a Trinidadian jurist was appointed by the
Commonwealth secretariat in London to undertake a review of the
commission's report.
</P>
<P>
Observers today said the seizure of Momoh's properties is a
serious blow to Momoh's political ambition. He led the All
People's Congress (APC) government from 1986 until it was toppled
in 1992 when he fled to Guinea in self exile.

<HEADLINE> Law on Application of Scientific Achievements to Go Into Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- China's first law governing
the application of scientific and technological achievements will
go into effect on October 1.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, the central government will earmark
special funds to be used for the work, and state banks and
financial organizations will offer additional assistance to help
transfer the achievements into actual production, said Song Jian,
State Councillor and Minister of the State Science and Technology
Commission, who spoke today at a meeting on the implementation of
the new legislation.
</P>
<P>
Tax departments will also draft favorable policies to aid the
projects, Song said at the meeting, jointly sponsored by the
State Science and Technology Commission and the Education,
Science, Culture and Public Health Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
He said China plans to encourage the establishment of high-risk
funds for the application of scientific achievements, in an effort
to support the high-investment, high-risk and high-yield projects.
</P>
<P>
The law stipulates that a number of projects will be given
priority in terms of arrangements and obtaining state support, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
The state will assist projects that could substantially raise
the technical level for an industry, as well as those that could
be competitive in the international market, and others that could
add to the planned development of resources.
</P>
<P>
The energy-saving and prevention of environmental pollution
projects, high-yield and effective agricultural development
projects, and those for economic development in remote areas will
also have increased state support.
</P>
<P>
Each research institution will receive 20 percent of the income
from their units' transferring of scientific achievements,
according to the new law. In addition, the scientists who
supervise the research and workers who make contributions to the
projects will receive bonuses.
</P>
<P>
Anyone caught stealing or otherwise illegally obtaining
information about others' scientific achievements will be fined or
punished in the legal system, the law states.
</P>
<P>
The law was adopted by the Standing Committee of the NPC in
May.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Criticizes Israel For Touching Off Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Two Kuwaiti newspapers
today sharply criticized the Israeli government for touching off
violence and called on the Arab world to confront Israeli
attempts to torpedo the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
In its front page editorial, the Arabic daily Al-Qabas said
the Israelis were taking an opportunity to commit massacres of
the Palestinian people and confiscate more land in addition to
befouling the holiest shrine of Islam.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent clashes between the Palestinians and
Israeli troops in the Palestinian self-ruled areas and Jerusalem,
due to the Israeli opening of a tunnel near the Al Aqsa Mosque,
the paper said the Israeli measures were leading the peace process
to a dark tunnel.
</P>
<P>
It said: "we are sure that the international conscience, which
was shaken by the invasion of Lebanon, and massacres in
Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila, Lebanon, in 1982,
will activate in the face of the new Likud massacres."
</P>
<P>
Another Arabic daily Al-Seyasseh expressed hope that the
U.S. should bear the responsibility for stopping the practice of
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
It said, "Curbing Netanyahu now and dislodging him from acting
haphazardly and saving the Middle East peace process is the
U.S. responsibility."
</P>
<P>
The paper said U.S. President Bill Clinton should not delay
this responsibility even if he is occupied with other priorities.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is trying to escape from implementing the signed
agreements with the Palestinians, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Al-Qabas asserted the responsibility of saving the Middle East
peace process and securing it from Jewish fundamentalism lies on
the international community topped by the United States as a
co-sponsor of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel's decision Tuesday to open the archaeological tunnel
near the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem's Old City sparked fierce
clashes between the Palestinians and the Israelis, and the
three-day violence killed 70 Palestinians and Israelis and
wounded about 1,000 others.
</P>
<P>
The mosque is Muslim's third holiest shrine after Mecca and
Medina in Saudi Arabia. The Palestinians are afraid that the
reopening of the tunnel would damage the foundations of the holy
site.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Kuwaiti Minister of AWKAF and
Islamic Affairs Ali Fahad Al-Zumai and Foreign Minister Sabah
al-Ahmed al-Sabah had denounced the Israeli decision to open the
500-meter tunnel.
</P>
<P>
The deadlocked Middle East peace process, which started a new
chapter in 1991 when all frontline Arab states and Israel
gathered at the Madrid conference, came to a critical point after
Israel's right-wing Likud Party headed by Netanyahu came to power
in June this year.

"The central government has attached great importance to
closing the widening gap between the economically developed east
and the less developed central and western areas, by issuing its
industrial policy, and the locations of productivity to boost the
economies in the central and western parts," said Abul'ahat
Abdurixit, chairman of the Xinjiang regional government.
</P>
<P>
The chairman disclosed that the central government will invest
160 billion yuan to help Xinjiang's development in the coming five
years.
</P>
<P>
"The support of the central government and other provinces and
regions is a prerequisite for the economic development of the
region, which is advancing along the road of prosperity through
the joint efforts of the people of all ethnic groups," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tian Chengping, governor of Qinghai province, believes that the
central government's policy will not only help to narrow the gap
between the eastern part and the central and western parts, and
promote a coordinated economic development between regions, but
also "benefits the nation's long-term development strategy and its
lasting political stability."
</P>
<P>
China's central and western parts cover all the provinces and
regions except the economically developed 12 coastal provinces and
cities.
</P>
<P>
Included is northwest China's Xinjiang, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Gansu
and Qinghai, which cover 3.03 million square kilometers of areas,
about one third of the country's total, and have a combined
population of 86 million, accounting for only seven percent of the
national total.
</P>
<P>
Due to historic and natural conditions, northwest China still
has one eighth of its people living below the poverty line, with
its gross domestic product (GDP) increasing at an annual of 9.57
percent during the 1991-95 period, in comparison with 11.6 percent
of the GDP in the nation, and 16 percent in the east.
</P>
<P>
Making full use of the preferential policy measures of the
central government, northwest has pledged to put on a new look by
the end of this century by speeding up the development of natural

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Two organizations today
expressed concern over the repatriation order by the United Arab
Emirates on illegal foreign migrants to leave before late
September, and urged the UAE to halt deporting the Somalis.
</P>
<P>
In a separate statement by Dr. Ismail Center for Human Rights
and the Committee to Care the Rights for the Somali Refugees
Abroad, the two agencies called on the UAE to exclude Somalis
from the on going deportation activities on the illegal migrants.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Somalis have no proper authority which
would facilitate them to the necessary evacuating measures, and
that the reasons that forced the Somalis to flee were civil
strife and instability which still exist in the country.
</P>
<P>
UAE President sheik Sayid Bin Sultan was called on to offer a
temporary residence permit to the Somalis. "We are specially
worried about the fate of those who couldn't find the travel
expenses to move out," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The deportation order by the UAE will affect more than 10,000
Somali Nationals who have been involved mainly in business
activities. According to the UAE authorities, any foreigner who
doesn't leave before the end of this month could face long
detention.
</P>
<P>
The statement by the Human Rights groups came only a day after
the arrival of more than 370 Somali deportees from UAE. According
to a spokesman for the local airline companies, 140 of the
deportees arrived in Mogadishu yesterday, while the rest were
delivered to Hargeisa in SomaliLand, Bosaso, Borame and Erigavo.
</P>
<P>
"Many Somali families in the UAE cannot afford to get a one
way ticket because the price is 300 U.S. Dollars," said the
spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Government's Helping Hand For China's Northwest (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- An on-going drive to narrow
the east-west economic divide in China has won wide acclaim from
poverty-stricken regions.
</P>
<P>
A top-level strategy, backed by the country's top leaders, will
ensure that the less developed central and western areas will win
the lion's share of investment funds between now and the end of
the century.
</P>
<P>
The policy decision is a critical help for the country's
northwest region - spanning five provinces and autonomous
regions. In that area alone one eighth of families still live
below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
People in the less developed northwest, home to many ethnic
groups, are enthusiastic about the central government's policies
to favor their economic development, and have vowed to work even
harder to make them succeed.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is building 30 key capital
projects this year at a cost of over 12 billion yuan, with 5.76
billion yuan coming from the central government this year. It is
striving to become the country's largest market-oriented cotton
producer as well as a key production base for oil, natural
gas and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China's largest home for Islamic
people and an arid area, is diverting water from the Yellow River
to improve the lives of farmers and irrigate more fields.
</P>
<P>
And Qinghai, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces are focusing on
building energy facilities as well as telecommunications and
transport projects.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the Fourth Session of the Eighth National
People's Congress passed the policy measure in favor of developing
central and western areas, which includes the northwest.
</P>
<P>
The policy includes carrying out a central financial transfer
payment system in central and western parts of the country:
</P>
<P>
-- Giving priority to projects for developing natural resources
and infrastructure;
</P>
<P>
-- Encouraging Chinese and overseas investments to the central
and western areas, following a government decision to allocate 60
per cent of overseas funds and investment to these two less
developed areas;
</P>
<P>
-- Streamlining pricing system of resource products;
</P>
<P>
-- Guiding processing industries from developed coastal areas
to central and western areas where there is abundant raw
materials. This will mean moving factories inland; and
</P>
<P>
-- Asking economically developed areas in coastal areas to
support the less developed central and western parts and ethnic
minority regions.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Condemns Clashes in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Pretoria has condemned
the latest violent clashes between Palestine and Israel in the
occupied territories, saying the Middle East peace process must
be revived, ''the Citizen'' paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting the council of Arab
ambassadors to South Africa in Pretoria on Friday, Deputy Foreign
Minister Aziz Pahad said: ''we are extremely concerned about the
latest developments and South Africa will do everything possible
to see that what had been agreed to regarding the Middle East
peace accord was implemented.''
</P>
<P>
Pahad said the South African government would remain very
seized with this issue because trouble in the Middle East could
have repercussions for the whole African continent.
</P>
<P>
Pahad met the ambassadors at their request to discuss the
deteriorating situation in the Middle East and to find ways in
which South Africa could assist, said the report.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 people had been reportedly killed and over 700
wounded when violent clashes broke out between Palestinians and
Israeli soldiers in the Gaza strip, West Bank, Hebron and East
Jerusalem earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The violence was sparked by a decision of Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to open a new entrance in a
controversial archeological tunnel near Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa
Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam.
</P>
<P>
However, Pahad said South Africa on its own could at this
stage not do much more than express condemnation of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, consultations are taking place with the
Organization of African Unity on possible further action, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Pahad also expressed concern that a planned state visit by
President Nelson Mandela to the region at the beginning of
November, to promote peace among others, could be in jeopardy in
the light of the latest developments.

<HEADLINE> India Concerned Over Renewed Violence in Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- India today expressed grave
concern over the recent violence in the West Bank and Gaza caused
by Israel's opening of a tunnel beneath a mosque in East Jerusalem
and called for immediate measures to end the hostilities.
</P>
<P>
"We are horrified at the tragic loss of several innocent lives
and the large-scale injuries following violent clashes," said an
External Affairs Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
These developments served to emphasize the "moral, legal and
humanitarian imperatives" of the Middle East peace process. There
is also the necessity for building further on the agreements and
understandings already reached in order to move rapidly toward a
just, comprehensive and lasting settlement in the Middle East, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
There is an urgent need to create a climate which would enable
purposeful negotiations, based on a recognition of the underlying
causes of the conflict, he added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Warns Against Afghanistan Disintegration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran today warned against
disintegration of Afghanistan following the Taliban militant
students seized Kabul on Friday after fierce fighting with
government troops.
</P>
<P>
President Buranuddin Rabbani fled the Afghan capital to
Charikar, some 70 kilometers north of Kabul, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The English daily "Iran News" said that Afghanistan is faced
with disintegration, accusing Pakistan and Saudi Arabia of
supporting the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily "Akhbar" noted in its editorial that the
the Taliban, backed by Pakistan, has put Afghanistan on the
verge of an ethnic civil war and most probably disintegration.
</P>
<P>
It said that the warring factions would go back to their
ethnic affiliations and then the power struggle would turn into a
costly confrontation between the Peshtons, Uzbecks and Tajiks.
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to believe that the Taliban group would be able to
establish peace and security in Afghanistan," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that Pakistan did not share Iran's view and ignored
Iran's efforts toward the establishment of national
reconciliation, but it will not be able to make advances alone.
</P>
<P>
"Jumhuri Islami" said in its editorial "It is bitter but a
reality that the struggle of the competing factions has never
been able to establish a balance in Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily believed that the Taliban has grown as a
result of U.S. planning, Saudi financing and Pakistan's logistical
backing.
</P>
<P>
The editorials by the Iranian press show that the Iranians feel
uneasy as Kabul fell into the hands of the Taliban militant
students backed by Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian expert said:"it clearly indicates that Iran's
mediation efforts were not successful at least for the time
being."
</P>
<P>
Iran's special envoy and Deputy Foreign Minister Alaeddin
Boroujerdi had regularly shuttled between Tehran and Kabul in the
past few months. But the Iranian efforts to bring to power
Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostam, another major player in the Afghan
crisis, failed as the Taliban gained more strength.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has already
expressed concern over the fighting, saying "We have repeatedly
advised them that war is not the right way to solve their
problems but unfortunately they don't let go."
</P>
<P>
Today's English daily "Tehran Times" echoed the president,
saying "The history of Afghanistan has proven that bloodshed, war
and fratricide can not solve the crisis in that country. All
Afghan groups should take a lesson from their own history and
avoid resorting to arms to achieve their ends.
</P>
<P>
The daily also called on the United Nations to take a leading
role in Afghanistan in order to find a common position for all
sides concerned.

PARIS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After three days of Israeli-Palestinian confrontations which
have killed more than 70 people, Benjamin Netanyahu gave his first
political response Friday evening by remaining intransigent and
giving little hope of letting the peace process go out of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by a large team of ministers, army chiefs and
security chiefs, Netanyahu gave a message in the manner of a
declaration of war, saying that tanks and armored vehicles have
been deployed near Palestinian localities.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also accused Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat of
"cynically taking advantage of but one affair" -- the opening of a
tunnel near the Esplanade of Mosque Al Aqsa in Jerusalem. He also
accused Palestinian police of "violating the agreements" by
opening fires and said that "the return to calmness" was the
precondition for his meeting with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
-- The Afghan capital Kabul fell at dawn Friday to the Taliban
militias, who immediately imposed the Islamic Sharia law, executed
former president Najibullah, and set up a government.
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, Najibullah was dragged behind a jeep
before being hanged on a lamp post in central Kabul, drawing tens
of thousands of mobs to watch the scene.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations condemned the summary execution as a murder
and a violation of international law which protects the immunity
of U.N. offices.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Unemployment in France strongly deteriorated in August with
the total number of unemployed people reaching 3,085,100, or 12.6
percent of the workforce. Prime Minister Alain Juppe described
the new figures of unemployment as "frankly bad" and Minister of
Labor Jacques Barrot has expressed fear of a "general depression."

SINGAPORE, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Defense Tony Tan will pay a visit to the
United States from next Monday to Wednesday, the Ministry of
Defense said today.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the United States, Tan is scheduled to call
on Defense Secretary William Perry and other Pentagon officials.
He will also hold discussions with members of the Senate and the
House of Representatives, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Tan will also visit the Dallas Naval Air Station in Texas and
the Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, where the Singapore Air Force
is receiving training on the Chinook helicopter and F-16 fighter
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Singapore has been a strong supporter of U.S. military presence
in the Asia-Pacific region and was the first country to offer
facilities to the U.S. military when U.S. forces had to leave the
Clark and Subic bases in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Singapore signed a memorandum of understanding with
the United States to give the latter access to its military
facilities.
</P>
<P>
"Access to Singapore's facilities has enhanced the ability of
the U.S. military to deal quickly with contingency situations in
the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, the Korean Peninsula, and
Somalia," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It added that "Singapore's offer of facilities opened the way
for U.S. engagement in the region through access arrangements."

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A joint water
development project between South Africa and Swaziland, which
would cost 455 million U.S. Dollars over 10 years, has been
reaffirmed by Swazi government ministers.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held in Mbabane on Friday, South African Water
Affairs Minister Kader Asmal and his Swazi counterpart reverend
Muntu Dlamini agreed to proceed with the construction of two dams
on Komati River system, ''the Citizen'' paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed a treaty in 1992 for the joint water
project.
</P>
<P>
The strategy plans to construct the dams in the Komati River
basin spanning South Africa's Mpumalanga Province and northern
Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
A dam in South Africa is under construction and should be
completed by 1998, when the construction of Swaziland's Maquqa
Dam would begin.
</P>
<P>
Asmal told the newspaper that the plan is an example of the
existing cooperation between member states of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the project will improve water
supply to Swaziland, South Africa and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The project would allow for previously neglected small
commercial farmers in South Africa to receive properly irrigated
water.
</P>
<P>
Other benefits for the three countries include improved local
water supplies, sanitation, hydro-electric power and economic
opportunities for surrounding communities.

<HEADLINE> China Working Hard to Feed Growing Population (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- China has been trying hard
to increase food production for feeding its ever growing
population, which now stands at 1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
While paying greater attention to farming and pumping up more
money into agriculture, the central government has also raised
purchasing prices for grains several times in recent years to
protect farmers' enthusiasm in growing more grains.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, governors of all provinces and cities are made
responsible for ensuring the "rice bags" (grain supply) of their
respective areas.
</P>
<P>
China, which feeds 22 percent of the world population with
only seven percent of the world arable land, harvested a record
465 million tons of grain in 1995, or 388 kg per person.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the century, China's population is expected to
reach 1.3 billion, 100 million more than today's.
</P>
<P>
With an additional 100 million people to feed, the country
needs to harvest 490-500 million tons of grain a year to maintain
its current per capita grain supply. This means that each year
before the turn of the century, China has to reap an additional
nine million tons of grain.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the implementation of administrative measures to
ensure its agriculture a success, China has also tried other
measures to boost grain production.
</P>
<P>
One major measure has been to stabilize, or even increase, the
country's land under cultivation by imposing a tight control on new
industrial land use.
</P>
<P>
Many areas, in cooperation with state land
administrations, have designated large tracts of farmland as
"non-touchable" zones for any industries.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990-94, according to estimates, close to one percent
of the country's total national cultivated land was lost annually
to industries.

<P>
The government has also made efforts to reclaim available
wasteland and has mapped out plans for large-scale land
reclamation. Northeast China is expected to add half a million
hectares of farmland before the end of the century and northwest
China, 200,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
China has 33.3 million hectares of wasteland fit for
reclamation, according to Du Ying with the Development Research
Center Under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, China has encouraged the research of
agro-science and technology and the application of advanced
agro-techniques.
</P>
<P>
According to Du Ying, over the past five years, advances in
science and technology in China accounted for 30 percent of
increased yields of crops, while in developed countries, the
contribution of science and technology reaches 70-80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Lin Yifu, a professor with Beijing University, calls for
developing good strains to boost output. A recent three-year
survey conducted by Professor Lin shows that potential per-unit
yield of rice, or wheat or corn in China is double or triple the
current per-unit output figure.
</P>
<P>
"If good strains are guaranteed through national efforts,
per-unit yield of the major crops in our country can increase by
70-170 percent in 20 years, enough to double today's national
grain output," he says.
</P>
<P>
The result in applying the hybrid rice technology has supported
the view.
</P>
<P>
Since the wide application of the technology beginning from the
mid-1970s, hybrid rice has contributed an additional of 280
million tons of grain output, equivalent to China's total rice
output in the two years preceding the introduction of the
hybrid rice technology.
</P>
<P>
Professor Yuan Longping, father of the hybrid rice, has just
successfully bred a new hybrid rice, which he claims is able to
yield 30 percent more than his former brainchild.
</P>
<P>
"I believe China can feed itself by relying on advances in
science and technology," said Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, agro-technicians have also been working hard to work
out new kinds of quality animal feed which consumes less grain.
Last year the country produced 50 million tons of meat, or 41 kg
per person.

<HEADLINE> Army Strongman Wins Gambia Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Gambia's military strongman
Yahya Jammeh has won presidential elections held on Thursday to
end two years of army rule, a report from Gambian capital Banjul
said today.
</P>
<P>
With all 45 constituencies in the west African country
declared, Jammeh polled 204,315 votes or 55.54 percent, while his
strongest civilian challenger Ousainou Darboe received 131,673
votes or 35.80 percent, according to a final declaration on state
television by Electoral Commission Chairman Gabriel Roberts.
</P>
<P>
Two marginal civilian candidates -- Amath Bah of the National
Reconciliation Party and Sidia Jatta of the small People's
Democratic Organization for Independence and Socialism -- polled
21,178 votes or 5.7 percent and 10,637 votes or 2.9 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The election was marked by heavy turnout of 82 percent. Voting
day passed off peacefully but Darboe took refuge in the
Senegalese embassy in Banjul the same day along with some family
members and political associates.
</P>
<P>
Jammeh's win is bound to alarm others in west Africa faced
with a new political challenge: coup makers exploiting the
advantage of incumbency to legitimize their rule through the
ballot box.
</P>
<P>
Jammeh, 31, seized power in a 1994 coup, ousting elected
president Sir Dawda Jawara who had ruled the small country of one
million people from independence from Britain in 1965.
</P>
<P>
Jammeh resigned from the army in August to contest the
elections that he brought forward from 1998 under western
pressure. Western creditors froze aid and some put a temporary
ban on their nationals travelling to the tourist haven in West
Africa.

DAR ES SALAAM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The government of
tanzania has said it is not aware of the plans by Oganization of
African Unity (OAU) Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim, a
Tanzanian to contest the post of U.N. Secretary General.
</P>
<P>
The director of Information, Research and Policy in the
Foreign Ministry, Cyprian Majengo, told reporters here on Friday
that Tanzania still supports the African backing of Bourtros
Boutros-Ghali for a second term.
</P>
<P>
"All African countries agreed in Yaounde, Cameroun, to support
the candidature of Boutros-Ghali. How comes that Tanzania
reverses its stand in New York?" he wondered.
</P>
<P>
He said it has been a tradition by all African countries to
endorse only one name whenever there was a certain international
post to contest.
</P>
<P>
Majengo said if there was such a decision it sould have been
made much earlier to enable the country to prepare itself for the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Election of the U.N. secretary general is scheduled for
November 5.
</P>
<P>
The candidature of Boutros-Ghali is however opposed by the
United States which is pressing for a replacement by soneone who
should be "an administrator rather than a diplomat and
statesman," as the U.S. put it.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has warned that if Boutros-Ghali is re-elected, it is
prepared to use its veto.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Power Scheme to Take off Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR Es SALAAM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar urban
center's power rehabilitation project will take off next week.
</P>
<P>
Generalr Manager of the Zanzibar State Fuel and Power
Corporation (SFPC) Rashid Hamid told newsmen on Friday in the
Town of Zanzibar that the project would take 22 months and cover
the Zanzibar town and Pemba Island.
</P>
<P>
It is a project funded by the African Development Bank at a
cost of 5.5 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to Hamid, under the project, all underground cables
of high and low tensions in the Town of Zanzibar will be replaced
and three new transformer sub-stations will be built in the
seaside bustling town.
</P>
<P>
He said after completing the work in the Zanzibar town, the
project's main targets would focus on Pemba towns of Wete, Mkoani
and Chake Chake.
</P>
<P>
This is the second electricity project in Zanzibar. The first
one was the Zanzibar rural electrifications funded by Norway
through the Norwegian Agency for Development Corporation (NORAD).
</P>
<P>
Since the completion of the rural electrification project last
year, about 60 percent of rural areas in both islands of Unguja
and Pemba enjoyed total electricity services.
</P>
<P>
Unguja and Pemba electricity requirements amount to 15
megawatt. Zanzibar has been receiving electricity from the Kidatu
hydropower station in the Mainland via a marine cable since 1980.
</P>
<P>
However, the Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) has
been frequently complaining on Zanzibar's defaults on paying the
debt. Zanzibar so far owes TANESCO 2.5 billion Tanzania Shillings
(about 4.2 million U.S. Dollars) for the services.

renewal of violence.
</P>
<P>
Three Palestinian protesters were killed and more than 100

<HEADLINE> Privatization for Zambians, Minister Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is to
review the privatization program with a view to allowing more
Zambians to participate in purchasing parastatals, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Siamukayumbu Siamujaye, Minister of
Commerce, Trade and Industry, as saying that his ministry will
embark on a program to empower Zambians economically.
</P>
<P>
''You will realize that 75 percent of the companies that have
been privatized so far have been bought by Zambians, but we will
still widen the ownership base of our citizens,'' Siamujaye told
the general meeting of the Zambia Association of Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (ZACCI) that was held recently.
</P>
<P>
He said that his ministry is about to start re-examining the
privatization program in the country with an intention to widen
the capability of Zambians to purchase the companies to be
privatized.
</P>
<P>
Siamujaye noted that Zambians are unable to borrow money to
buy companies due to limited access to credit facilities.
</P>
<P>
ZACCI Chairman George Chabwera said at the same function that
the business community in Zambia is impressed with the rate at
which the government is progressing with the privatization of the
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM).
</P>
<P>
Chabwera urged the government to consider creating a fund to
help Zambians have access to credit and buy some of the companies
listed for privatization.
</P>
<P>
ZCCM is a state-own conglomerate which monopolizes the
country's copper industry and earns the country 80 percent of its
foreign exchange income. The government has begun to put it in
capital markets worldwide on sale in an effort to attract funds
to boost the country's copper industry.

<HEADLINE> Jerusalem Police Remain On High Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Jerusalem police remain on
high alert today amid intelligence warning about possible further
violence after Friday's bloody clashes that killed three and wounded
more than 100 others.
</P>
<P>
Israeli intelligence service received reports that Palestinian
protesters in east Jerusalem attempted to disrupt the peace on
Shabbat, the day of rest for the Jews. Thousands of policemen and
soldiers were deployed around the Old City area to guard against
renewal of violence.
</P>
<P>
Three Palestinian protesters were killed and more than 100
others wounded in Friday's bloody clashes between Muslim
worshipers and Israeli police in the Al-Aksa Mosque on the Temple
Mount. The police restored calm after about an hour of
confrontation by firing rubber bullets and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
On Friday evening, several incidents of stone-throwing in
Jerusalem were reported, but no major violence occurred. About 10
Palestinian youths were arrested at the Jaffa Gate to the Old
City, after they threw stones at police cars and other Israeli
vehicles. One policeman was slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
Violence spread to the holy city after two days of bloody
confrontation across the West Bank and Gaza. Nearly 70 people
have been killed and more than 1,000 others wounded so far.
</P>
<P>
The violence started on Wednesday when Palestinians held
demonstrations to protest Israel's opening of an archaeological
underground tunnel in the Old City, which the Muslims denounced
as a plot to undermine their holy places, the Al-Aksa Mosque and
Dome of Rock, the third holiest place for Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Israeli leaders blamed the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
for inciting the bloodshed, vowing that Israel would never bow to
any pressure of violence.
</P>
<P>
Hardline Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blasted PNA for
violating the signed peace agreements by inciting the violence,
and ruled out any Israeli concessions on the issue of the
tunnel. Meanwhile, he urged PNA President Yasser Arafat to control
the Palestinian security forces, who took part in the shootouts
with Israeli troops in the occupied territories, and return to
the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinians and Arabs are demanding that the
controversial tunnel be closed to quell the riots sparked by the
Israeli decision.
</P>
<P>
Efforts continued today to have both sides exercise restraint
and resume the peace process, which is now under grave
danger. The U.S. government is trying to arrange a summit between
Netanyahu and Arafat, which was regarded as the only effective
way to end the violence.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said that the
meeting would take place soon, but it would only be announced by
the concerned parties themselves. U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, a major peace monger between the two sides,
telephoned Netanyahu Friday evening to discuss the ways to rescue
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said the Netanyahu-Arafat meeting could possibly
take place tonight at the border crossing between Israel and Gaza
Strip. Israel Radio said that a tripartite summit meeting between
Netanyahu and Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was
also likely to be held in Cairo soon.

<HEADLINE> India Sees Sharp Decline in Steel Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Steel producers led by the
Steel Authority of India Limited ( SAIL) are facing a major glut
because of a slowdown in steel demand in the second quarter of
this year, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown has resulted in a growing inventory with primary
steel producers. Between April and August this year, the inventory
went up by 418,000 tons. The sales of 2.2 million tons of steel
between June and September this year represented a growth of
merely 1 percent over the previous year, far below the target of 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
During the April-September period of last year, sales jumped by
5 percent over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Bombay-based Lioyds Steel Company has cut down production
by 30,000 tons from its earlier target of 210,000 tons due to
slackening demand and poor price realization.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director Mukesh Gupta admitted that the problem of low
demand has forced his company to revise downward its production
target for the first half of the year, from 210,000 tons to
180,000 tons of hot rolled coils.
</P>
<P>
SAIL Chairman M. Nair blamed the situation on the fact that
most of the investment plans in major infrastructure and
industrial projects have either failed to get started or have been
reduced in scale.

<HEADLINE> Rao's Lawyers Advise Him Not to Appeal to Supreme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Former prime minister and
ex-president of the Congress Party P.V. Narasimha Rao's appearance
before court on Monday is a fait accompli as lawyers have advised
him not to seek any relief from the Supreme Court, Congress
sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Rao will be accompanied by a handful of the faithful in court
as the proposal mooted by loyalists to hold a massive rally in his
support did not find favor at the meeting of party general
secretaries Friday.
</P>
<P>
Congress new chief Sitaram Kesri, who presided over the
meeting, is reported to have said that a way would have to be
found to avoid contempt of the court and embarrassment to the
Gowda government. But at the same time, the party would have to
reflect the sentiments of Congressmen on the issue.
</P>
<P>
With this in view, Indian Youth Congress Chief M.S. Bitta will
be fielded to hold a public meeting.
</P>
<P>
Congress dissident leaders met Prime Minister Deve Gowda
earlier this week and urged the Central Bureau of Investigation (
cbi) to arrest Rao and put him into jail. They reportedly assured
Gowda that nothing would happen to his government if Rao is sent
to jail as the entire Congress Party is ready to join the
government.
</P>
<P>
Congress loyalists, however, have condemned the Gowda
government for its game plan to divide the Congress which is
supporting it from the outside.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi High Court rejected Rao's anticipatory bail plea
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Judge Ajit Bharihoke last Saturday summoned Rao to appear in
person before the court on Monday as co-accused in a 100,000 US
dollar cheating case.

KAMPALA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Vivek Satyendran, an Asian
businessman was gunned down by two robbers at Lubowa on the
Kampala-Entebbe highway, 10 kms south of here.
</P>
<P>
According to "the New Vision" paper today, the robbers
fled in the deceased's car, after grabbing about 15,000 U.S.
Dollars from the victim on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Satyendran was materials manager of Roofing Ltd, a
steel-making factory in Lubowa, the paper said. A number of
Indians have returned to Uganda since 1990s and they were driven
out of the country in the 1970s by former President Idi Amin.
</P>
<P>
He was shot twice in the head and the chest and the incident
occurred at around 1:30 p.m., said the paper.
</P>
<P>
A witness was quoted as saying that the robbers threw the victim's
body out of the car before driving away and the vehicle was later
found abandoned at Namasuba, a suburb of Entebbe on Entebbe-Kampala
road.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis:  Banharn's Dissolution Move Takes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa's abrupt decision Friday to dissolve the lower house
of parliament caught both coalition and opposition parties off
guard.
</P>
<P>
Even key executives from Banharn's own Chart Thai (Thai Nation)
Party were infuriated by his action.
</P>
<P>
The six coalition parties, including Chart Thai, would prefer
to stick to government rather than go to the polls, because their
chances of success and their inclusion in the new government would
then be uncertain.
</P>
<P>
Since last Saturday when Banharn announced, moments before a
no-confidence vote in parliament, that he would resign within
seven days in exchange for support from the other five coalition
parties, he had been avoiding meeting leaders of the five
coalition partners, leaving them alone to find a successor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile he was reiterating that he would not dissolve
parliament in the wake of the political deadlock over the
selection of a new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Within Banharn's Chart Thai Party, key figures had suggested
naming Pramarn Adireksarn, 83, advisory chairman of the party, as
the new prime minister. However, he could not win backing from
other coalition parties.
</P>
<P>
There had also been suggestions that opposition Chart Pattana
(National Development) party leader and former prime minister
Chatichai Choonhavan be made Banharn's successor.
</P>
<P>
But nor could Chatichai's nomination get the approval from the
five coalition parties, which believed that there were more
capable and suitable persons among themselves.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the five coalition parties -- New aspiration, Social
Action, Nam Thai (Thai Leadership), Prachakorn Thai (Thai Citizen)
and Muan Chon (Masses) -- had reportedly agreed on the nomination
of New Aspiration leader and Deputy Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh as Banharn's replacement.
</P>
<P>
Even Sanoh Thientong, secretary-general of Banharn's party and
minister of public health, supported Chavalit's nomination.
</P>
<P>
However, Banharn, as leader of the country's largest political
party, would not let the premiership go to other parties, let
alone to Chavalit, because it was Chavalit who had forced Banharn
to make the resignation pledge a week ago in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Banharn's dissolution decision is seen as a revenge on the
allies who ganged up against him prior to the no-confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
The move will in particular deprive Chavalit of the chances to
become a prime minister without a general election.
</P>
<P>
Banharn's daughter Kanchana, also an MP, said, "People who have
done bad to others cannot go to the top."
</P>
<P>
Explaining why he decided to dissolve the house Friday, Banharn
said the turmoil could have escalated if he allowed his coalition
to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
"If I leave the situation like it is, more problems will arise,
aggravating the lack of confidence in the political process,' he
added.

<HEADLINE> Security Tightened at Najibullah's Family House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Indian authorities have
further tightened security at the family house of Afghan former
president Mohammad Najibullah following his execution in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Security officers did not allow the media to meet the family in
Asiad village in south New Delhi, capital of India.
</P>
<P>
"The family members are in deep mourning and do not want to
meet anybody," said one of the security officers deployed outside
the government rest house where the Najibullah's family has been
staying since 1992.
</P>
<P>
India is also reported to have offered Najibullah political
asylum, but he could not leave Afghanistan due to consideration of
his safety in departure.
</P>
<P>
Najibullah was hanged by the Afghan student militia Taliban
when they seized Kabul, capital of Afghanistan on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Najibullah, 50, who had taken shelter at the UN office in Kabul
since April 1992 when guerrillas ousted his soviet-backed
government after a 14-year war, was dragged from the UN office to
the street and hanged from a lamp post in the heart of the city.
</P>
<P>
"The family of Mr. Najibullah was already under high risk
category and we had taken no risk in their security arrangements.
From today we asked them to be extra vigilant," the officer said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopes Taleban move toward reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States held out
hope today that the Taleban militia who took over Kabul would move
toward national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"Our hope ... is that the new authorities in Kabul will move
quickly to restore order and security and to form a representative
interim government that can begin the process of reconciliation
nationwide," State Department spokesman Glyn Davies said at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Davies also hinted at the possibility of establishing full
diplomatic ties between the two countries, saying Washington had
not ruled out recognizing the new regime and establishing
diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
"I just think it's really too early to pronounce ourselves on
questions like diplomatic relations yet," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that since the Taleban "appear to hold a majority of
the cards at this stage, our call on them is to use their new
position of authority to move to establish democratic institutions
and to move to a process of national reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
The Taleban militia appealed today for international
recognition of its government after its forces captured the
capital Kabul.
</P>
<P>
When asked about former President Najibullah and his brother
who were shot dead and hanged on a concrete traffic-control post,
Davies said, "The extra-judicial action taken against Najibullah
and his associates was a regrettable development."
</P>
<P>
The United States has not had an embassy in Kabul since the
former Soviet troops left in the late 1980s. But there have been
some low-level contacts with the Taleban, Davies said.

<HEADLINE> LPG Has Bright Marketing Future in Asia-Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The marketing of liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG) in the Asia Pacific region in the next century
will have great prospects due to the increasing awareness of
people on use of environmentally friendly energy, an Indonesian
company official said.
</P>
<P>
"The demand for LPG in the Asia Pacific region increased from
one million barrels per day in 1990 to 1.3 million in 1994, an
increase of 6.3 percent per year," chief executive of the
Indonesian state oil company (Pertamina) Faisal Abda'oe said at
the opening of the ninth world LPG forum in Bali, west Nusa
Tenggara province, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that by the end of this century the demand will
increase to 1.8 million barrels per day, Antara news agency today
quoted Abda'oe as saying.
</P>
<P>
About 54 percent of the 1994 demand was met by the region
itself, while the remaining 46 percent was supplied by the Middle
East with Saudi Arabia as the main supplier.
</P>
<P>
Import of the fuel is expected to increase by about 800 barrels
per day in the year 2000 with Japan and South Korea as the main
importing countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, Indonesia produces 3.1 million tons of LPG per
year, of which 80 percent are for export.

<HEADLINE> Sweden to Probe South Africa's Alleged Role in Palme Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior prosecutor
stressed the need today to send experts to South Africa to
investigate in the country's alleged role in the murder of Swedish
former Prime Minister Olof Palme.
</P>
<P>
Solveig Riberdahl, deputy attorney-general in charge of the
case, said the information about South Africa's alleged
involvement in Palme's murder 10 years ago was important, adding
that she had asked the foreign ministry to help get the
information South Africa has on the case.
</P>
<P>
Riberdahl also said Swedish police had started to review the
documents concerning the relations between the Palme case and
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported Thursday that Eugene de Kock, a former
South African police officer convicted of apartheid assassination,
implicated at a trial in Pretoria that South African security
services engaged in the 1986 assassination of Palme.
</P>
<P>
De Kock alleged that Craig Williamson, a notorious South
African agent, played a role in the murder code-named "Longreach"
operation.
</P>
<P>
Williamson was commander of a secret service whose task was to
eliminate political opponents of South Africa's apartheid regime.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Expressen and Aftonbladet said today that
when Palme, an outspoken opponent of apartheid on the
international arena, was murdered on February 28, 1986, Williamson
and several other South African agents were in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Palme was shot in the back in downtown Stockholm as he and his
wife walked home from a movie theater without bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
A suspect was tried for the crime in 1989, but the court
acquitted him, calling the evidence circumstantial. Since then few
leads have emerged.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the South African government had promised to probe
in De Kock's implication.

<HEADLINE> Kuala Lumpur Share Prices Weekly Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange second board, in the limelight for the past few months,
staged a sharp pull-back on Thursday, causing prices to stay lower
across the board in fairly active trading this week.
</P>
<P>
Apart from profit-taking activities, the sharp downtrend of the
second board index was mainly due to "in-house restriction"
imposed by certain stockbroking firms on their margins late
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Though the second board was due for correction, most investors
were caught by surprise when they were requested to put up 30
percent upfront money when buying such stocks.
</P>
<P>
Its phenomenal success over the last few months saw the index
rising from 300 points to more than 600 points. This week, it
touched an all-time high at 632.45.
</P>
<P>
However, it fell 4.97 points to 595.58 after hovering below the
600-point psychological level towards the end of the trading week.
</P>
<P>
At Friday's close, the Composite Index was up 1.78 points to
1,130.59, the broader Emas Index gained 0.25 of a point to 329.67
and the Industrial Index added 0.83 of a point to 2,149.24.
</P>
<P>
But buying interest on some speculative main-board stocks
following the US Federal Open Market Committee's decision to leave
interest rates unchanged at midweek, coupled with broad money
supply slowing down in August, helped limit the overall downslide.
</P>
<P>
On the broad money supply, an analyst said, "The lower growth
in all the three monetary aggregates M1, M2 and M3 for August
augurs well for the economy because it shows that the country's
inflation is under control."
</P>
<P>
Broad money supply or M3 moderated to RM3.2 billion or 1.1
percent against RM4.9 billion or 1.6 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, trading on the KLSE was rather slow in
reaction to the July trade figures which came on the back of two
months' trade surplus. However, most analysts said the July trade
figures were expected and should not be cause for great concern.
</P>
<P>
During the week, two new stocks -- insurance company Jerneh
Asia Bhd and chocolate confectionary manufacturer Apollo Food
Holdings Bhd -- were listed on the main board and second board,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
On the main board, turnover eased to 914.247 million shares
valued at RM6.681 billion from 991.812 million shares worth
RM7.255 billion previously.
</P>
<P>
Volume on the second board declined to 602.420 million shares
worth RM7.114 billion against 634.360 million shares valued at
RM7.249 billion the previous Friday.
</P>
<P>
Off-market deals plunged to 133.405 million units valued at
RM1.433 billion from 175.291 million shares worth RM1.788 billion.

<HEADLINE> Cuba to Reopen Havana Hotel Where Hemingway Lived </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Ambos Mundos Hotel, where
American writer Ernest Hemingway lived, will be reopened in
January 1997, according to Prensa Latina.
</P>
<P>
The six-story hotel with more than 50 rooms was built in the
1920's in an eclectic style, and its restoration was started in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Located in the oldest section of Old Havana, the hotel is near
the most attractive vistas of the city: the entrance to Havana Bay
and its old system of fortifications.
</P>
<P>
The floor structures for guest rooms and the room always
reserved for Hemingway on the fifth floor will be preserved. this
floor will keep its original pink arabesques, and it is expected
to be turned into an exhibition in order to pay homage to the
famous American novelist.
</P>
<P>
Relics of the tale-teller preserved in the island will be
exhibited in a transitory way. The original furniture -- an
ordinary wooden double bed, two small night tables, a writing
table and two chairs -- was so deteriorated that it was unusable.
</P>
<P>
Hemingway had lived in Havana for 22 years since he first
arrived here in April 1928. During that time, he always returned
to the hotel.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
general prosecutorship filed new charges against jailed drug lord
Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, presenting evidence of his injection of
drug money into the 1994 election campaigns, local press said
today.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez Orejuela, considered as one of the heads of the Cali
drug trafficking cartel, was detained on August 6, 1995 and is
kept in the La Picota prison.
</P>
<P>
The drug kingpin will be charged with prevarications in public
and private documents and bribery, according to judicial sources.
</P>
<P>
Local press quoted general prosecutorship sources as saying
today that the evidence shows there was an organization
transferring drug money to President Ernesto Samper's election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
According to the documents, about 3.2 million U.S. dollars from
drug trafficking entered Samper's campaign, which is considered as
illicit enrichment to benefit third parties.
</P>
<P>
But Samper, who won election in 1994, has denied the charges
that he used drug money to finance his campaign and vowed to serve
out his four-year term.

<HEADLINE> Flowers Sent By Telegram in Vogue During Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Sending greetings and flowers
by telegram is becoming a favorite way for Beijing residents to
express their good wishes to friends and relatives no matter how
far away they may be, according to a report in today's "China
Daily".
</P>
<P>
The service, which started two years ago, has been in
particularly high demand during the past week thanks to the
approach of the Mid-Autumn Festival, which fell yesterday, and
National Day coming on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday morning, the Beijing Telegraph and Telephone Service
(BTTS) Hall in downtown Beijing was crowded with people sending
telegrams.
</P>
<P>
According to the BTTS, although greetings telegrams, which
usually cost no more than five yuan each, are much cheaper than
more populous flower telegrams. Wednesday afternoon saw sales of
30 flower telegrams. Fewer than 30 greetings were telegrammed
during the whole day.
</P>
<P>
Thursday morning again witnessed a fever for flower telegrams,
with nearly 40 of them sent.
</P>
<P>
Flower telegrams are divided into four categories- 20 yuan
(2.41 US dollars) for one flower, 50 yuan for one small bunch of
flowers, 80 yuan for a medium-sized bunch of lowers and 120 yuan
for a large bunch of flowers.
</P>
<P>
The 80-yuan flower telegrams were in highest demand, said an
assistant.
</P>
<P>
"Because we cannot enjoy the traditional festival together
under the full moon, I want may brother to have a happy festival
and to understand that I miss him," said Ms Xing, an employee from
the Beijing Bureau of Posts and Telecommunications. She spent 50
yuan telegraming flowers to her brother in Harbin, Heilongjiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
The holiday season is also a booming time for phone
service. The Beijing Long-Distance Telephone Bureau said private
calls usually dominate long-distance phone service at those
times.

STOCKHOLM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Sweden has strongly

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Taliban Change Afghan Scenario by Capturing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan scenario has
been totally changed by the Taliban Militia who captured the
capital city of Kabul Friday and vowed to establish pure Islamic
rule in the country.
</P>
<P>
This is the biggest victory gained by the student militia --
who regard all other warring factions as criminals -- since its
mysterious emergence at the end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's offensive earlier this week was so strong that
the coalition troops loyal to President Burhanuddin Rabbani and
Premier Gulbuddin Hekmatyar managed to defend Kabul for only three
days.
</P>
<P>
Observers here attributed the Taliban's victory to their higher
morale, upgraded military equipment, and flexible strategies and
tactics.
</P>
<P>
The inexperienced Taliban forces had advanced into the
southwestern part of Kabul in February, 1995, but was routed by
Rabbani's troops and fled to southern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban launched a major offensive on Kabul again in
October, 1995, but was stopped just five km south of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
After an 11-month standoff between the two sides south of
Kabul, the Taliban major striking forces recently overran three
eastern provinces which were relatively weak in defence, cutting
off a major transportation line to Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces reached the eastern suburbs of Kabul on
Tuesday and unleashed waves of attacks on the outer defence lines
of the government troops.
</P>
<P>
The three-day battle for the city left hundreds of people
killed or injured, and the main streets were littered with
destroyed tanks.
</P>
<P>
The defeated government troops, thousands of Kabul residents,
and dozens of foreigners had retreated before the Taliban seized
the whole capital.
</P>
<P>
The first thing the Taliban did after entering Kabul was to
kill Mohammad Najibullah, former President of the Soviet-backed
regime, whose body was hanging from a traffic-control post near
the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban has accused Najibullah of killing many Afghan
nationals during his rule in the country from 1986 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
The surprising killing was strongly condemned by the UN which
had granted Najibullah protection in a UN office in Kabul for over
four years.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban tried to ensure the safety of Kabul
residents and the foreigners who had not left the city, and
allowed a 30-truck UN relief convoy to enter Kabul last night.
</P>
<P>
A six-member Taliban interim council was also set up hours
after the fall of Kabul to serve as the interim government.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Kabul was relatively calm but the factional
fighting in the country is far from over as troops loyal to
Rabbani and Hekmatyar were not totally routed.
</P>
<P>
They took away heavy weapons and shifted aircraft to safer
areas before pulling out of the capital, and blew up their stocks
of ammunition which could not be carried away.
</P>
<P>
Some Rabbani's officials abroad termed the retreat as a special
strategy to avoid huge civilian casualties, and they disclosed
that a counter-attack will be launched in the future.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the capture of Kabul by the Taliban has so far
failed to win much international support.
</P>
<P>
The US government has called on the Taliban to work with other
Afghan groups to form a government in Kabul, and deplored the
execution of Najubullah.
</P>
<P>
Russia has voiced alarm at the Taliban's capture of Kabul,
saying that the takeover would worsen the existing crisis in the
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani Friday expressed
concern over the escalation of fighting in Afghanistan and termed
the situation as a disaster.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has decided to send a delegation
immediately to establish contact with the new regime in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believed that the prevailing situation in
Afghanistan is in the favor of the Taliban which have controlled
two-thirds of the Afghan territory and four of the five big cities
including the capital.
</P>
<P>
However, the long-running Afghan crisis is unlikely to be over
in the near future as the country's recent histroy has proved that
fighting is not the way to solve the Afghan problem.

<HEADLINE> 1949-79 Chinese Artworks at Auction (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua Correspondent Zhou Xiaoxue) --
Some 120 Chinese artworks made during the politically motivated
period of 1949-79 are to be auctioned next month.
</P>
<P>
As a pioneering art sale for China by the China Guardian
Auction Company, the auction features artworks ranging from
celebrated Chinese watercolors and oil paintings to twentieth
century engravings.
</P>
<P>
The artworks reflect the social life and important historical
events of a politically sensational period, which endowed them
with a special value, says Chen Lucheng, a famous art critic from
the People's Fine Arts Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
Visitors unfamiliar to that period might be astonished at
seeing a poster to welcome the former Zambian President Kenneth
Kaunda with the words "Down with US imperialism! Down with Soviet
Revisionism!", or the head of the late Chairman Mao Zedong in a
design of a shining sun with the title "Chairman Mao is the red
sun in the heart of the revolutionary people of the world".
</P>
<P>
Though the works are full of political input, that does not
mean that they are artistically inferior, he said, adding that the
artists were devoted to their themes when they painted these works.
</P>
<P>
Now art of that thirty year period has become a "hot" topic
both for academics and collectors. Yet not many books on the art
of the period have been published so far, partly because only a
few of such artworks have survived since the so-called "Cultural
Revolution" (1966-1976).

<P>
"The collection is a material resource for those who are
interested in the study of the arts from that time", says Kou Qin,
deputy manager of the China Guardian Auction, who has prepared the
sale.
</P>
<P>
The first painting offered in the collection depicts a prelude
to the founding of the New China in 1949: the liberation of
Nanjing, where the Kuomintang central government was located.
</P>
<P>
A rare work in oils by Wu Zuoren, the former president of the
Central College of Fine Arts of China, the painting depicts a
scene of that time in Beijing instead of Nanjing. In front of the
Dongdan Pailou (decorated archway), which was dismantled in the
1950s, a boy is seen selling newspaper extras with the story of
the liberation in Nanjing, while people gather to read the latest
news.
</P>
<P>
The history of New China unfolds with the paintings. In 1950,
the people's Liberation Army attacked and occupied Hainan
Island. In the early 1950s, the People's Voluntary Army of China
went to the Korean battlefields.
</P>
<P>
Painters were assigned to rural areas to gain first-hand
experience during the Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives
period. "Spring comes back with red flowers and green fields" is
the title of one of their works.
</P>
<P>
The depiction of a furnace at the back of a welfare house of a
rural people's commune is a reminder of the "going all out for
smelting iron and steel" movement, when people across the country
were mobilized to smelt their iron pots to make steel.

From the late 1960s, learning from the "selected works of Mao
Zedong" became a fashion in the country, as shown in a picture of
a group of farmers learning the selected works of Mao Zedong
during a break from work in the fields, inscribed with the
characters: "to learn whenever there is time".
</P>
<P>
Pictures illustrating Mao's poems were also very popular.
</P>
<P>
But it was a hard time for many senior artists.
</P>
<P>
Feng Zikai, one of China's most famous modern cartoonists, had
to repaint a cartoon series which he had originally executed 30
years before. The copies were used as a proof of his "guilt"
because they depicted Kuomintang soldiers as heroes in the
Anti-Japanese War of 1937-45.
</P>
<P>
The early 1970s was also a time when only eight modern
revolutionary operas could be performed on the stage, as a poster
about the so-called "model opera" shows.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Mao's call that the rural area was "a vast world
where much can be accomplished", a generation of youth went to
distant rural lands, as is depicted in the picture named "Beijing
girl learning to ride a horse", which has the Mongolian grasslands
as the background.
</P>
<P>
Classrooms had been moved to open fields; workers' propaganda
teams played a leading role in factories; and class struggle a
major factor in daily life.
</P>
<P>
With the end of the "Cultural Revolution", diversity revived in
China's art circles. "A legend of the white snake", painted in
1979, is a first decorative design of that time.
</P>
<P>
The legend tells of a snake spirit falling in love with a young
man, but they failed to protect their marriage from destruction by
a monk. The legend is reported to have been one of Mao's
favorities.

During the 30 years, Mao's hometown of Shaoshan in central
China's Henan Province, became a frequent subject for the art
world.
</P>
<P>
Three pictures of Shaoshan, by famous individual painters, are
featured in the collection.
</P>
<P>
The landscape of Shaoshan seen in the earliest, by Li Xiongcai,
looks more natural compared to the last, by Li Keran, which has
been described as a holy land. The intermediate painting of
Shaoshan is by Fu Baoshi, whose works have been among the most
popular at recent auctions.
</P>
<P>
In addition to traditional watercolors and oil paintings, the
collection includes engravings that are reflective of the period.
</P>
<P>
Most eye-catching in the collection could be a portrait of
Chairman Mao wearing a Red Guard arm band, titled "Following
Chairman Mao to Advance Against Stormy Waves" or it might be a
portrait of Fidel Castro, "Hero Above the Caribbean Sea".
</P>
<P>
Here the Cuban Communist leader is seen with his head held high
above cliffs, a hint of his solid-rock will and determination to
survive. The item is appraised at 10,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
"That does not mean that the piece worth only that much, " says
Kou Qin, the Guardian vice-manager. "It is very hard to give the
collection a price because none of its kind has been put into
market before, " he says.
</P>
<P>
Kou revealed that the whole collection is estimated at 10
million yuan. "But only after the auction can we have an idea of
what their true value will be," he added.

<HEADLINE> Food Convoy Arrives in Afghan Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A 30-truck convoy of food
arrived in the Afghan capital of Kabul overnight from the north
while another food convoy was on the way, reports from Kabul said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the Taliban religious student militia, who overran
Kabul on Friday, have said they will allow the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to run an aid convoy to help
feed the city's citizens.
</P>
<P>
ICRC delegation chief Michel Ducraux met with a Taliban militia
leader Friday and won approval in principle for sending a convoy
of 35 trucks to distribute food on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
About a quarter of the city's population of more than one
million depend on humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
The three-day battle for Kabul has left several hundred people
killed or injured and hospitals were overflowing, according to the
ICRC sources.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC also wants to reopen its air link with Kabul, which
was suspended Thursday due to the heavy fighting.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have seized Bagram airbase 50 km north of the
capital, the only operational airport for Kabul for about a year.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban promised to reopen Kabul International
Airport, which has been closed for almost a year because of the
Taliban siege of Kabul since last October.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- An Italian charged
with drug trafficking and detained for eight months in a prison in
Santafe de Bogota will be extradited Saturday to his country, said
judicial authorities today.
</P>
<P>

ago.
</P>
<P>
The Italian will stand trial at the Court of Florence on

More than 500 bank accounts belonging to the main drug cartels
in several countries were frozen and some 20 drug trafficking
kingpins were captured during the operation.

BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua)-- As China is engaged in its
modernization drive, publishers are encouraged to serve the 1.2
billion people's mental appetite with healthy, appealing and
nourishing dishes of spiritual produce.
</P>
<P>
The momentum has led to a thriving publishing industry the
country has never seen. Producing the "food for thought" now are
563 publishing houses across the country, against 75 in 1976. In
addition, there are 300 audio-visual and 30 electronic publishing
houses.
</P>
<P>
The best demonstration of the industry's prosperity is a book
exhibition held in Beijing in mid-July, representing the
achievements China has made during the past 47 years, particularly
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, the biggest of its kind since the founding of
New China in 1949, involved 540 publishing houses and 143
audio-visual publishers.
</P>
<P>
Some 60,000 books of 38,000 titles, 9,276 copies of
periodicals, 3,100 kinds of audio-visual and 180 electronic
publications were put on display during the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
As these exhibits were carefully selected by publishers as
their best products, bookworms were more than pleases. They
thronged about the exhibition hall and elbowed their way from one
booth to another, hoping to find something to their liking.
</P>
<P>
The five-day exhibition attracted 130,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Press and Publication Administration of China
(PPA) showed some 31.68 billion copies of books were distributed
with a business turnover of 62.62 billion yuan in sales during the
1991-1995 period, up 105.7 percent and 222 percent respectively
from the previous five-year period.
</P>
<P>
These publications are on a variety of subjects, ranging from
political works, literature and history to gardening and
cuisine. Science and technology accounted for 30.7 percent of the
key books recommended by PPA in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The publications are mainly distributed by the State-run Xinhua
chain of bookstores and a swelling number of private book stalls.

<HEADLINE> Thriving Industry in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Readers wanted a better dish for their spiritual life,
especially when their material lives had already been much
improved thanks to the country's economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, every Chinese, on average, spent 12 yuan on books. It
represented hardly one percent of their expenditure, nevertheless
it was an increase of 84.6 percent over 1980.
</P>
<P>
To cater to this need, the country's publishing industry, still
regarded as an important education medium and required to produce
books that should conform to the socialist directions and meet the
demand of the socialist market economy, began to shift its focus
in 1990 from producing output to product quality.
</P>
<P>
The industry began to work on the increase of varieties instead
of copies of books, setting a target of two percent annual growth
rate for varieties for the 1991-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
According to PPA, publishing houses nationwide have registered
an average annual growth of 7.3 percent in varieties of books,
while the number of printing copies have stayed around 6.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese publishing industry is also targeting the overseas
market. Chinese publications are represented each year at nine
major international book fairs.
</P>
<P>
China has established copyright protection relations with more
than 100 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to set up Chinese bookstores in all the major
countries of the world before the end of the century," said Zhou
Hongli, general manager of the China Foreign Trade Corporation of
Publishing, the country's key channel for exporting Chinese
publications.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are 30 book exporters in China that sell more
than five million copies of books in about 40,000 categories
annually, and the sale grows by 15 to 20 percent every year on
average.
</P>
<P>
But the buyers, however, are mainly university libraries,
research institutes and book dealers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese bookstores to be set up in foreign countries will
serve the need of a large reader's group, in addition to the
academic circles.
</P>
<P>
"We are working hard to enable more and more foreigners to
share the Chinese food for thought," Zhou said.

<HEADLINE> Cubans, Brazilians Suspended at Courtside Brawl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Both Cuba and Brazil had two
team members each suspended for courtside fightings after their
encounter Friday night at the Women's World Volleyball Grand Prix
Grand Final in Shanghai, China.
</P>
<P>
The suspended were Cuban Regla Torres and Regla Bell, and
Brazilian Ericleia "Filo" Bodziak and Ana Flavia Sanglard.
</P>
<P>
In the round-robin Grand Final, Brazil defeated world and
Olympic champion Cuba 15-7, 15-9, 9-15, 7-15 and 15-10 to revenge
their semifinal loss in the Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
At match end, Sanglard, Brazilian team captain, was taunting
the Cubans face to face at the net in a replay of their Atlanta
Olympic altercation, with her focus against Cuban Torres.
</P>
<P>
The Cubans responded with shouts and challenges and Bell also
had words to say to Sanglard.
</P>
<P>
Coaches and fellow teammates from both sides rushed to restrain
both players and successfully separated the two.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the banter was flared up anew by Brazilian Bodziak, and
Torres charged Sanglard by striking her around the head and
shoulders and Bell followed suit, going straight for Bodziak
chasing her around the court.
</P>
<P>
After minutes of confusion, order was retained and both teams
were escorted to their respective locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
"This type of behavior can never be tolerated in any form by
the FIVB, we are very disappointed at the conduct of both teams,
appropriate actions will be taken," said FIVB president Ruben
Acosta who was in attendance at the match.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with FIVB regulations, all four players will be
disqualified from competition for the remainder of the tournament,
and will not be allowed to sit on the team bench, they will also
be subject to further fines and sanctions by the FIVB, said the
Control Committees presided over by Tatsuro Uzuki from Japan.

<HEADLINE> New Continental Bridge, "Silk Road" of Today (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On September 11, 1995, China and Kazakstan signed in Beijing an
agreement to use the Port of Lianyungang for loading, unloading
and transport of transit goods destined for Kazakstan.
</P>
<P>
Last January, China, Kazakstan, the Republic of Korea, Japan,
Poland and Estonia, reached agreements on ways of increasing cargo
transport volumes through the new continental bridge, use of ports
in the countries, and the establishment of representatives'
offices.
</P>
<P>
Companies of the United States, the Republic of Korea, Japan
and Hong Kong are already using the "bridge" to transport goods
from Lianyungang to central Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
In early May of this year, 400 officials and experts from 36
countries and regions and 15 international organizations, gathered
in Beijing to discuss how to use the "bridge" to boost economic
development in Asia and Europe in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The meeting concluded that the "bridge" will provide a new
opportunity for Asian-European cooperation in seeking development.
</P>
<P>
However, participants agreed, many problems have to be resolved
to get the "bridge" fully commissioned: infrastructure facilities
in different countries need to be improved, customs procedures
coordinated and tariffs unified.
</P>
<P>
The meeting adopted a declaration, pledging "special attention"
to the setting up of "permanent mechanisms" to coordinate the
efforts of the concerned countries, regions and international
organizations for the development of the "bridge".

<HEADLINE> New Continental Bridge, "Silk Road of Today" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A modern-day "Silk Road" -
the new Asia-Euro continental rail link - has made it possible to
journey from Europe to China in just three weeks.
</P>
<P>
It is in stark contrast to the 13th century when it took six
years for Italian traveller Marco Polo to complete his historic
trek across a similar route.
</P>
<P>
The new continental bridge runs between both ends of the modern
"silk road", -- Lianyungang of China and Rotterdam in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The route is formed from a network of railways servicing China,
Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan,
Russia, Poland, Germany and the Netherlands. When fully
commissioned, it will benefit some 40 countries in Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The China-Central Asia section of the "bridge" officially went
into service on November 23, 1995.
</P>
<P>
This followed two years' trial operation of the section, during
which China invested 1.3 billion yuan in operational costs.
</P>
<P>
The trial operation was successful. In 1995, 3,136 standard
containers were shipped from Lianyungang to different central
Asian destinations, and the figure will jump to 10,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
According to China's development plan for the next 15 years,
the country is shifting its development efforts to its
under-developed central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
And it so happens that the section of the "bridge" in China,
4,131 kilometers in length, passes right through these regions,
with Lianyungang as their nearest outlet to the sea.
</P>
<P>
The railway runs through what is often referred to as China's
"gold belt". In areas within 100 km of the railway are found 63.2
percent of China's known coal reserves, 40 percent of oil, 50
percent of natural gas, and 30-77 percent of nickel, aluminum,
copper and gold.
</P>
<P>
It is a key reason why China has been most enthusiastic in
developing the new continental bridge, especially in its central
and western regions.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Parliament Ratifies Accords Normalizing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Both houses of the Yugoslav
parliament ratified on Friday an agreement on normalization of
relations with Croatia and economic accords with Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The parliament's upper house ratified at its first autumn
session earlier in the day an agreement on the normalization of
relations with Croatia signed here on August 23 and an agreement
on economic cooperation with Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the session, Deputy Foreign Minister Radoslav
Bulajic said the agreement on mutual recognition between
Yugoslavia and Croatia was a crucial step in the normalization of
Yugoslavia's relations with the former Yugoslav republics, which
was a major commitment of the country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement provides for the framework of our long-term
relations and cooperation based on an equal footing, mutual
respect and mutual interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ratification of the agreement will further contribute to
Yugoslavia as a constructive and peace-oriented factor in the
region and Europe as well as to its full reintegration into the
international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
Only by implementing the agreement consistently and fully can
Yugoslavia and Croatia confirm their firm commitment to the
development of stable and good-neighbourly relations and
cooperation in keeping with the U.N. charter, Bulajic said.
</P>
<P>
The laws on the ratification of economic agreements with
Macedonia confirm agreements on trade cooperation, protection of
investments, avoidance of double taxation in the case of income
and property, customs cooperation and cooperation in road, railway
and air transport, Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia and Macedonia normalized their relations in April of
this year, which paved the way for bilateral relations and
cooperation with the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the parliament's lower house at its first fall
session also ratified the agreements, according to Tanjug report.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on normalization of relations with Croatia was
adopted with 71 votes for, three votes against and no abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Milan Gajevic, who heads Montenegro's ruling Democratic Party
of Socialists, said that ratification had set aside the effects of
war with neighboring Croatia, created conditions for resolving the
Serb question in Eastern Slavonia, removed the outer wall of
sanctions against Yugoslavia and enabled the setting of
preconditions for regular state and economic cooperation with the
former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
Milomir Minic, the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia's whip,
described the agreement as "in the profound interest of our
country and peoples, having the support of the widest Yugoslav
public."
</P>
<P>
By ratifying the agreement, said Minic at the lower house
session, "We have confirmed our determination to settle all
disputes in peace, through political negotiations."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The 10th Sino-U.S. Joint
Committee on Commerce and Trade (JCCT) ended its two-day meeting
here today with both sides calling it a success and an impetus to
the expansion of bilateral trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the final plenary session of the meeting with
smiles, both Wu Yi, head of the economic and trade delegation of
the Chinese government and Minister of Foreign Economic Relations
and Trade, and her U.S. counterpart Michey Kantor held a joint
press conference to announce their achievement in the past
two-days.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the press conference, Wu said the meeting, which
was proceeded in a "friendly and pragmatic" manner, achieved a
success.
</P>
<P>
She said the three working groups of the committee achieved
good results with seven aviation projects and 14 electronic
projects set for next year.
</P>
<P>
She said the meeting will push bilateral economic and trade
cooperation a great step forward.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that both sides expressed a common aspiration that
joint effort should be made to further the Sino-U.S. economic and
trade relationship.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides realized that the economic and trade relationship
is an important part of the Sino-U.S. relations as a whole, and is
also a foundation of the relations," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The development of bilateral economic and trade cooperation
not only is in the interests of the people of the two countries,
but also benefits to the stability and peace in the world," she
added.
</P>
<P>
She said that it is unfair to exclude China, the 11th biggest
trading country in the world, from the World Trade Organization
(WTO).
</P>
<P>
She said that China is willing to pay the "admission fee" to
the WTO, but the fee must be consistent with the level of China's
economic development.
</P>
<P>
She said that as a developing country, China is willing to join
the WTO on the basis of balanced rights and obligations.
</P>
<P>
She said that she is happy to learn that the U.S. Government
would actively support China's access to WTO, and would take a
flexible and practical approach on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Kantor said the meeting was "very successful" and both sides
had a "constructive dialogue" on expanding commercial relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. side also convey a strong message of the
need of comprehensive improvement of China's trade and investment
regimes.
</P>
<P>
He said that the meeting was another step in the on-going
process to improve U.S. relations with China.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is confident that the continued engagement with
China will provide solid footing for better relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Kantor also announced that the U.S. Import and Export Bank
approved this morning financing supporting the sale of more than
495 million U.S. dollars of Boeing and McDonnell aircraft to
China.

<HEADLINE> Request to Recount Bosnian Election Results Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, September 27 (Xinhua) - Bosnia's Provisional
Election Commission (PEC) on Friday refused to take a vote
recounting, thus paying the way for final certification of the
September 14 election results.
</P>
<P>
"The Provisional Election Commission is of the unanimous
opinion that an additional physical recount of all ballots...is
neither a practical nor a necessary response to the concerns
raised," a PEC statement said.
</P>
<P>
The election commission was established by the Organization of
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and chaired by American
diplomat Robert Frowick, who has final say if it fails to reach
consensus.
</P>
<P>
A vote recounting was called for by the International Crisis
Group, a self-declared election monitor, which claimed that more
ballots were cast than actual voters, raising concerns of election
fraud.
</P>
<P>
The request was also upheld by an appeals sub-commission under
PEC.
</P>
<P>
According to the preliminary final results of the elections,
the ruling parties of Bosnia's three ethnic groups will dominate
the various institutions to be established and incumbent president
Alija Izetbegovic, a Muslim, will be chairman of the new Bosnian
presidency.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Close Controversial Tunnel in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel was urged at an
open Security Council meeting on Friday to close a controversial
tunnel in Jerusalem, that has sparked three-day violence.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-six people have been killed and more than 1,000 wounded
in the Israeli-occupied territories since Israel open a new
entrance to an archaeological tunnel near Jerusalem's al-Aqsa
mosque, Islam's third-holiest shrine.
</P>
<P>
Farouk Kaddoumi, observer for Palestine, said that the actions
appeared to be designed by the current Israeli government as a
warning to Arab countries and that if the Israeli actions
continued, then the peace process was in mortal peril.
</P>
<P>
"The council must act by demanding the end of Israeli
provocation and closure of the tunnel in East Jerusalem," he said.
"The Council should send a fact-finding mission and then take
action."
</P>
<P>
Chinese Permanent Representative to the U.N. Qin Huasun urged
all sides to exercise restraint and abide by the agreements
reached between Palestine and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the Israeli actions has evidently damaged peace
and stability of the region, Ambassador Qin urged relevant sides
to take immediate measures to stop the conflicts and prevent
further bloodsheding incidents from happening.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has always been supporting the Middle East
peace process and maintaining that the Middle East problem should
be solved on the basis of relevant U.N. resolutions and under the
principle of "land for peace".
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov criticized Israel for
stalling on the Middle East peace process and said the latest
crisis was a "direct result of reckless activity."
</P>
<P>
"Russian urges strongly all the interested parties to show
maximum restraint and to avoid action that would worsen the
situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain and France are also critical of Israeli actions.
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind called for a moratorium
on opening the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said the Middle East
was "in danger of seeing its death-knell if the international
community does not act quickly and firmly."
</P>
<P>
Nearly 50 countries are listed as speakers in the open meeting,
with almost all participants criticizing the Israeli actions and
calling upon it to close the tunnel.

<HEADLINE> AL Concerns over Israeli-Palestinian Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Cairo-based Arab League
(AL) is greatly concerned over the deteriorating situation in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip following the fierce clashes between
Israeli troops and Palestinians in the past three days.
</P>
<P>
The AL is closely following up the latest developments "on the
Palestinian arena" following Israel's digging of a tunnel under
the premises of Al-Aqsa mosque, according to Al's Assistant
Secretary General for Palestinian Affairs Sa'eed Kamal.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted the AL official as
saying that daily coordination is underway with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to identify the steps Arab countries can take in
this connection in accordance with the Arab summit resolutions and
Thursday's statement released at the end of AL's emergency meeting
on the issue of Al-Aqsa mosque.
</P>
<P>
Kamal said that the ongoing incidents in the Palestinian
territories were caused by the Israel's hardline policies on the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Kamal said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should
resign and hand over power to President Ezer Weizman in order to
avoid further bloodshed. He said this was not an intervention in
Israeli's internal affairs rather than a move aimed at
forestalling further deterioration of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
At least eight people, including six Palestinians, were killed
and over 200 wounded in the third day of Israeli-Palestinian
bloodshed which spread to Jerusalem today.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Stone-throwing Palestinian Moslems clashed with
Israeli security forces in the Temple Mount area just after the
noon prayers ended. At least two Palestinians were killed and
about 125 others wounded as Israeli policemen stormed the
Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, firing rubber bullets and tear gas to
disperse them.
</P>
<P>
Live ammunitions were reportedly used, although Israeli
government said that the security forces had been given strict
order not to use them.
</P>
<P>
About 20 Israeli policemen were also wounded by flying stones
and bottles. However, security forces managed to restore calm in
the area after about an hour of riots. Witnesses said that elder
Moslems turned back some youths who intended to march into the
central city area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two Israeli border policemen were killed in
sporadic clashes in a comparatively calm day across the
Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Two
Israeli soldiers were killed and 10 others wounded in the West
Bank town of Tulkarm, as Palestinian security forces opened fire
as the Israeli soldiers tried to ward off thousands of Palestinian
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Israeli tanks have been sent to the area to protect the safety
of several Jewish settlements. One Palestinian was reportedly
killed.
</P>
<P>
Fierce clashes erupted in Jericho, as three Palestinians were
killed and 25 others wounded in the conflict. Moreover, 40
Palestinians were wounded in Qalqilya; 12 in Ramallah, the place
of the first shot was fired; another 12 in Bethlehem, 12 kilometers
south of Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador on Sanctions and UN Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Sanctions should not
be used as the chief tool for settlement of international
disputes, because they caused serious difficulties for third
states, especially developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese representative to the United Nations Wang Xuexian
reiterated the position of the Chinese government on sanctions,
while addressing the Sixth Committee (Legal) here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the application of sanctions could hardly avoid
adverse effects on third states, which would cause serious
difficulties to the economies of affected countries, especially
those of the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"We therefore maintain that in implementing sanctions imposed
by the Council, it is imperative that the right of third states
confronted with special economic problems to consult the Security
Council with regard to a solution to those problems be assured,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and the relevant states should make their priority the
choice of the most direct and prompt methods for assisting third
states affected by the implementation of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador also suggested assistance and
compensation be provided for the development of affected states
through preferential cooperative projects, such as credit plans,
under the U.N. economic and social development plans or the
arrangement between U.N. and and the relevant countries.
</P>
<P>
On the forms of settlement of international disputes, the
Chinese representative said that the U.N. system lacks the
corresponding mechanisms in response to the ways and means to be
used.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that advanced warning and settlement services
provided to parties involved in disputes by agencies similar to
the dispute settlement service are likely to reduce other actions
the U.N. is compelled to take, including sanction," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador also made suggestions on the revision of
the U.N. Charter, the improvement of the work efficiency and
financial arrangement of the international organization.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Israeli-Palestinian conflict Poses Danger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Information Minister
Safwat el-Sherif said here today that current confrontations
between Israeli troops and Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip pose a threat to the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government maintains that all Palestinian-Israeli
peace accords should be immediately implemented, which is the only
way to achieve stability, Sherif was quoted by Egypt's Middle
East News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He spoke of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's warnings that
the situation might explode in case no progress is achieved in the
peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
At least eight people, including six Palestinians were killed
and over 200 wounded in the third day of Israeli-Palestinian
bloodshed which spread to Jerusalem today.
</P>
<P>
Sherif said Egypt is making top-level contacts immediately
after the recent clashes that erupted in Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
The information minister said that Mubarak had contacts with
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The contacts were meant to exchange viewpoints on measures to
sidestep the present crisis, which was triggered by Netanyahu'
decision to open a tunnel under the compound in Jerusalem's
Al-Aqsa mosque, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sherif said that these contacts are expected to bear fruit in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak Thursday called for closing the tunnel and
taking practical steps in the peace negotiations between Israel
and the Palestinians.
