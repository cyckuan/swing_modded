<HEADLINE> China Tightens Control over Overseas Listing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The State Council, China's highest
governing body, released a circular today urging central and local
governments to tighten control over Chinese companies which issue
stocks overseas or are listed at overseas securities exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Chinese companies which are registered overseas, controlled by
Chinese assets and listed at overseas securities exchanges should
be supervised by local securities supervision organizations while
issuing stocks overseas.
</P>
<P>
Stock controllers of the Chinese assets must then report the
issuing to the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).
</P>
<P>
Chinese companies registered overseas can issue stocks abroad
or be listed at overseas securities exchanges provided they have
their assets inside China for more than three years, otherwise
they cannot. If necessary, their issuing must be examined by the
CSRC and approved by the Securities Commission under the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
As for overseas listing of the assets which are collected from
businesses inside China and transferred to overseas unlisted or
listed Chinese companies, Chinese stock controllers must notify
provincial governments or certain departments of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Those violating the regulations will meet tough penalties,
according to the circular.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Education Urged in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Minister of Health Katele
Kalumba here today urged companies in the country to introduce
AIDS education at work places so as to reduce the loss of skilled
manpower through the scourge.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made at the opening of the Hiv/AIDS symposium for
truckers.
</P>
<P>
A speech read on his behalf at the function said the Truckers
Association should join in the fight against AIDS by changing its
members' sexual behaviors.
</P>
<P>
At the same function, Gary Davis, UNDP Resident Representative to
Zambia, said that the AIDS pandemic would be a major setback on the
future development of the country if people do not change their
lifestyle. He urged people in the productive sector such as the
industry to maintain their morals so that they can continue
contributing to national development.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government has invested a lot in people who are
currently in the industry and this would all go waste if they
continue dying of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The Truckers Association Chairman, Chaples Madongo, said that the
number of AIDS cases in the country has continued to rise even with
the availability of condoms. enditem

<HEADLINE> Japan and England Score Big Wins in World Youth Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 20 (Xinhua) -- England whitewashed the
United Arab Emirates 5-0 on Friday to sail into the last 16 at the
world youth soccer championships with one game to play.
</P>
<P>
It joined defending champions Argentina, Mexico and Spain in
the knock-out round of the 24-nation under-20 tournament.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Murphy scored a hat-trick, two in the first half and one
in the second, as England won the group F game at Johor Baru.
</P>
<P>
Michael Owen scored the fourth in the 51st before UAE's
subsitute goalkeeper Ali Yarees netted an own-goal eight minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
England surged to the top of the group with six points after
main rivals Mexico were held to a surprising 1-1 draw by Cote
d'Ivoire in another group F game Friday.
</P>
<P>
In group E at Kangar, Argentina survived a scare before downing
spirited Canada 2-1 through a 65th minute penalty converted by
Roman Riquelme.
</P>
<P>
Bernardo Romeo gave Argentina the lead in the 32nd minute, but
Jason Bent levelled the score a minute before half-time as Canada
thwarted their fancied rivals during a fast-paced encounter.

Also in the group, Australia edged Hungary 1-0 on a last-minute
header goal from subsitute Daniel Allsopp, who came in the 82nd
min.
</P>

who won two games.
</P>
<P>
In another lopsided game, Japan drubbed Costa Rica 6-2 in Group

<P>
Spain maintained their unbeaten run in the same group with a
2-1 win over Paraguay, who were left with a solitary point.

ISLAMABAD, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Foreign Secretary

between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is premature to say anything before time, we are trying our

Kashmir issue during the talks, Haider said that "the two sides
are in the process of identifying all the issues which will come
under discussion."

<HEADLINE> Mandela Urges to Solve Refugee Problem in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela has called for serious commitment to solve the refugee
problem in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In a message to mark Africa Refugee Day today, Mandela described
the refugee problem as a serious threat to regional and continental
peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The refugee crisis, involving at least six million people, cannot
be treated in isolation from the economic, political and social causes
which give rise to it, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said finding solution to the crisis is closely linked to
achieving peace, upholding the rule of law, democracy and a human
rights culture.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, also the current chairman of the 12-nation Southern
African Development Community, attributes the fact that Southern
Africa stopped to be a major refugee-producing region a few yeas ago
to political settlements and smooth democratic transitions that have
taken place in the region.
</P>
<P>
The South African leaders say an integrated approach is required
to tackle the diverse issues confronting Africa and the rest of the
world today. enditem

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Launches Anti-Drugs War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government has
launched a campaign against drugs to counter a rise in drug abuse
among young Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
"The Cypriot government, recognizing the seriousness of the
drug problem, having assessed all social, psychological, economic
and cultural factors involved in drug use and having studied all
international declarations and agreements, decided to adopt a
national policy against drugs," Health Minister Christos Solomis
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Solomis made the remark at a press conference to mark the
International Day Against Drugs that falls on June 26.
</P>
<P>
The health minister noted the rise in drug abuse is most
prevalent in people between the ages of 16 and 35, while new
drug substances have found their way to the island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
However, Solomis stressed that drug addiction cases in Cyprus
are at what he called an enviable level in comparison with that
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Only four deaths were reported so far in Cyprus as a result of
the drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
According to the Minister, the national drug policy includes
the foundation and operation of an anti-drug policy center, the
establishment of special training programs, therapy and
rehabilitation of drug addicts and financial support for the
drug policy from the public and private sectors.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: More Political Issues for Denver Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DENVER, Colorado, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from the Group of
Seven industrialized nations and Russia are kicking off their
three-day summit by a grand dinner tonight hosted by U.S.
President Bill Clinton with more political issues on agenda than
it used to.
</P>
<P>
The summit is different from previous ones in two counts:
Russia's first full participation in the envent and no prominent
economic crisis around the world for the leaders to resolve.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who arrived here on Thursday
night, will participate all the events, both in political and
economic sectors, for the first time since Moscow was invited to
attend the summit in 1991.
</P>
<P>
But, the economic debates over interest rates and currency
values that have occupied leaders' attention for the past 22
summits will last one hour on Saturday afternoon without Yeltsin
present.
</P>
<P>
A draft final communique for the summit prepared for the past
four months by the eight countries is still under discussion by
the ministers and senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here say that the communique, which is due to be made
public on Sunday, is already clear on key goals.
</P>
<P>
Foremost is integrating Russia in the Western system, they say,
adding that the G-7 countries agreed to take several concrete
steps, such as letting Russia into the Paris Club and the World
Trade Organization (WTO) as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
However, Chief Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers
told local media that Clinton probably will not propose that
Russia become a full member of the G-7, changing the name to the
Group of Eight.
</P>
<P>
In the document, the leaders agree that open trade, fiscal
austerity and stable currencies is the best way to solve social
problems.
</P>
<P>
The economic talks will examine high unemployment in Europe and
how to resolve the problem of an aging population.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also generally agree on increasingly sophisticated
cooperative strategies for confronting an array of global problems
such as drug smuggling, nuclear safety and outbreaks of killer
infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
Despite consensus on many issues, leaders have sharp
differences to resolve during the summit.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which has a territorial dispute with Russia, is opposed
to a future full participation of Russia, arguing that Russia
needs to complete a lot of reforms in financial and other economic
areas.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. seeks to reward Moscow on acquiescing the expansion of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) by giving a strong
support to Russia's full participation.
</P>
<P>
For Russia, it seeks a phased integration into the system of
decision-making by the leading industrialized powers on most
important political, social-economic and monetary-financial
problems.
</P>
<P>
It insisted that Japan should not bring bilateral issues into
the multi-lateral process of the summit. Future full membership of
Russia in the group is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
As host, Clinton will push U.S. interests on several fronts. He
wants to rally support for the cleaning up in Chernobyl, Ukraine
after the 1986 nuclear reactor explosion. Clinton is expected to
ask for at least 300 million U.S. dollars from G-7 members.
</P>
<P>
But some European leaders are reluctant to pay more for the
project.
</P>
<P>
Other differences are likely to come from Europe as European
leaders walked into the summit amid doubts about Europe's
unification plans.
</P>
<P>
With their deficits higher than the three percent required for
joining European Monetary Union, France and Italy are concerned
about the fiscal criteria for the membership. Britain balks at
plans for military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Other political issues high on the agenda are Bosnia and Middle
East peace process. But analysts here say that there maybe no
concrete actions for pushing the process except some proposals or
sheer statements.

<HEADLINE> Outlook for World Wheat Trade in 1997/98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- World trade in wheat in 1997/98 is
forecast to expand by some 2 million tons, to 93.2 million tons,
International Grains Council (IGC) announced at its annual
conference which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
Global import needs are projected to rise further in 1997/98,
although recently improved supply prospects in India and China are
likely to limit the scope for any substantial increase in world
trade in 1997/98.
</P>
<P>
The growth in trade will result from rising consumption,
especially in Asia, and reduced crop prospects, particularly in
Northern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Trade in feed wheat, which expanded at a smaller than
anticipated rate in 1996/97, mainly because of higher than
forecast prices, is unlikely to rise further, unless significant
amounts of weather-damaged wheat become available.
</P>
<P>
Combined wheat output in the five major exporters (Argentina,
Australia, Canada, E.C, U.S.A.) is forecast to decline in 1997,
with some able to draw from accumulated stocks in order to
maintain aggregate export availabilities.
</P>
<P>
In view of the recent improvement in production prospects in
most of these countries, combined shipments in the year ending
June 1998 are projected to be the same as in the current year, at
87.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Canada, in particular, will be able to use its larger 1996/97
carry-over to expand exports, forecast to increase by some 3
million tons, to 20 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The United States, expected to produce about the same amount as
in 1996, has seen only a modest recovery in stocks, but should be
in a position to increase its exports by some 1 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Exports by the European Community, estimated to harvest a crop
slightly below the previous year's, are likely to be broadly
unchanged from the 1996/97 figure of 16 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Big-Leaf Mahogany to Open to Controlled Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The 10th Conference of the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) today listed
big-leaf mahogany species on Appendix Three which allows
lightly-controlled trade.
</P>
<P>
The compromise position was made at the last minute overturning an
earlier decision by the parties which rejected a proposal by Bolivia
and the United States to list the big-leaf mahogany on CITES'
Appendix Two, which allows strictly-controlled trade.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., the largest consumer of mahogany timber, said listing
the species would curb uncontrolled felling of the species threatened
to cause commericial extinction of the mahogany.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia, also a timber producer, said its proposal would enhance
cooperation between consuming and producing countries in conservation
programs.
</P>
<P>
However, Brazil, one of the range states, strongly contested
against the proposal saying this was coming just after it had
implemented its own measures to control indiscriminate harvesting of
the species.
</P>
<P>
During the plenary session today, Brazil and the U.S. finally
agreed to list the highly valued tree on Appendix Three, under which
mahogany trade would be controlled through the use of CITES export
certificates. enditem

<HEADLINE> Greece Welcomes U.S. Statement over Imia Islets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government today hailed
the U.S. statement over the Imia islets as "quite Significant."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon Thursday verified the
existence of an official navigational map issued by the U.S.
federal cartographical service showing the Imia islets as Greek
territory.
</P>
<P>
While welcoming Bacon's such statement, Greek Government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas also complained that since 1996, when
Turkey for the first time questioned the sovereignty of the Imia
islets, Washington had issued maps designating the islets also by
its Turkish name.
</P>
<P>
Imia, an uninhabited island with the area of 450 square
meters, is only 3.8 miles off the coast of Turkey in the Aegean
sea and 11 nautical miles from the Greek island of Kalimons.
</P>
<P>
Greece has insisted that the sovereignty of the island can not
be called into question while Turkey declared that the island
falls within the administrative limits of the Turkish province of
Mugla.
</P>
<P>
In early 1996, Greece and Turkey almost came to war over the
disputed island.

<HEADLINE> China Notifies UN on Treaties Applying to HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Qin
Huasun today sent a note to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
two annexes covering 214 international treaties that will apply to
Hong Kong from July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Qin, Permanent Representative of China to UN, said in his note
that in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration signed
on 19 December 1984, China will resume the exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong with effect from July 1, 1997. Hong Kong will
become a special administrative region, which will enjoy a high
degree of autonomy except in foreign and defense affairs, from
July 1.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the
Basic Law of Hong Kong, the international treaties, to which China
is a party, will apply to Hong Kong from July 1; the international
treaties, to which China is not a party but which are implemented
in Hong Kong, may continue to be implemented in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region from July 1.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time that the Chinese representative sent
notifications to the UN Secretary General on international
treaties that will apply to Hong Kong from July 1. Chinese
ambassador Wang Xuexian sent notifications to the UN Chief on June
6 and June 10 on 24 and 16 international treaties respectively
that will apply to Hong Kong from July 1.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin said that the 127 treaties listed in Annex I to
the note, to which China is a party, will be applied to Hong Kong
with effect from July 1 as they are applied to Hong Kong before
July 1; or they fall within the category of foreign affairs or
defense or, owing to their nature and provisions, must apply to
the entire territory of a state; or they are not applied to Hong
Kong before July 1 but with respect to which it has been decided
to apply them to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region with
the effect from that date.
</P>
<P>
The 127 international treaties in Annex I covers political,
diplomatic affairs and defense, narcotic drugs, international
crime, private international law, customs, marine pollution,
science and technology, civil aviation, merchant shipping,
investment, intellectual property, nature conservation, postal,
labor, human rights, international organization and trade.
</P>
<P>
The 87 treaties listed in Annex II to the note, to which China
is not yet a party and which apply to Hong Kong before July 1,
will continue to apply to the the Hong kong Special Administrative
Region from July 1.
</P>
<P>
The Annex II includes treaties on international crime, private
international law, customs, marine pollution, science and
technology, civil aviation, merchant shipping, trade, health,
property right, nature conservation, transport,
telecommunications, human rights, labor and international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"The provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights as applied to Hong Kong shall remain in
force beginning from July 1, 1997," Qin stressed in his note.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has already carried out separately the
formalities required for the application of the treaties listed in
the aforesaid Annexes, including all the related amendments,
protocols, reservations and declarations, to the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region with effect from July 1, he said.
</P>
<P>
"With respect to any other treaty not listed in the Annexes to
this note, to which the People's Republic of China is or will
become a party, in the event that it is decided to apply such
treaty to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the
Government of the People's Republic of China will carry out
separately the formalities for such application," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"For the avoidance of doubt, no separate formalities will need
to be carried out by the Government of the People's Republic of
China with respect to treaties which fall within the category of
foreign affairs or defense or which, owing to their nature and
provisions, must apply to the entire territory of a state," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador also asked UN Secretary-General to place
the note and the Annexes to it formally on record and bring it to
the attention of the other members of the United Nations and the
specialized agencies of the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's Militia Fight Koroma's Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Fighting between Sierra Leone's
military junta army and its traditional hunters known as Kamajors
has intensified since it broke out a few days ago, according to
reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The Kamajors stood up to oppose the military junta of Major Johnny
Paul Koroma who has overthrown the civilian government and ousted
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in a coup on May 25.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, fighting started at about 9:30 Thursday
morning (9:30 am GMT) when the army attacked the Kamajors in the main
street of Kenema, eastern Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
This was believed to be counter attack against the Kamajors'
assault on Wednesday on army bases in Kenema and Pujehun, southeastern
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general of the ruling Armed Forces Revolutionary
Council, Col. Abdulkarim Sise, reportedly alleged that Kabbah, Sierra
Leone's Ambassador to the United Nations James Jonah and Nigeria's
Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi had armed the Kamajors to fight the
junta.
</P>
<P>
He said considerable arms and ammunition, including food rations,
had been given to the Kamajors, while mercenaries had been hired from
Liberia to fight the army.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the west African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG has
vowed to restore the toppled civilian government. It is in the course
of military buildup for intervention when talks over the step-down of
Koroma fail.
</P>
<P>
Facing ECOMOG's imminent military intervention, the junta has
launched a series of diplomatic moves. A special envoy was in New York
on Wednesday to explain the situation in Sierra Leone to the United
Nations secretary-general and Security Council in a bid to seek their
support for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the special envoy is yet to be known. But it is
reported that a 14-man delegation sent by Sierra Leone's military
junta to Gambia and Guinea received a cold shoulder. Gambian
President Yahya Jammeh even refused to meet the delegation on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Koroma's emissaries to Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire
also got the message from leaders of the countries that the coup
makers should step down and the ousted civilian government should be
restored.

<TEXT>
<P>
DENVER, Colorado, June 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin are to meet here today
hours before the summit of leading industrialized nations opens.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will discuss European security issues, arms
control and Russia's integration into the global economy. The
meeting will be the third between them this year.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Yeltsin would continue their dialogue on the
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the
implementation of START 2 nuclear reduction agreement.
</P>
<P>
During their summit in Helsinki in March, Clinton promised
Yeltsin to help Russia to join the World Trade Organization (WTO)
and the Paris Club in order to soften Russia's opposition against
NATO's expansion.
</P>
<P>
But there is no concrete movement towards the goal so far.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials here say that Clinton will try to gain support
from other G-7 countries to help Moscow to join the international
institutions.
</P>
<P>
"We're making progress with Russia, but it has not yet
formulated its market access offers," U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky told reporters when referring to Russia's
joining in WTO.
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, we would like Russia to be able to move quickly, but
the substance is not there yet," she added.

<HEADLINE> CITES Conference Hailed as a Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The 10-day conference of the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)
ended in Harare this afternoon with delegates hailing it as a
success.
</P>
<P>
The conference considered 75 proposals on various species of fauna
and flora and made more than 60 resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The agenda of the conference was dominated by debates on
elephants, bears, whales, the southern white rhino and mahogany
species.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing ceremony, CITES Secretary-General Izgrev
Topkov said, ''we have laid in hare the foundation for an integrated
approach to development and conservation.''
</P>
<P>
He said the historic decision by the parties to downlist elephants
from the endangered species' list signalled a growing realisation by
the parties that sustainable use was necessary for conservation of
species.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Nambia and Botswana won their bid, amid firm opposition
from some western parties and non-governmental organisations, to
renew ivory trade on experimental basis in 1999 under strictly
monitored conditions.
</P>
<P>
Specified quotas from the three countries would be sold only to
Japan under the conditions set by the cites.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Environment Program Deputy Executive Director Rueben Olembo
said at the closing session it was important to realise that there
were no winners or losers at the cites.
</P>
<P>
''If we were to single out winners and losers, we must seek the
answer from the species, the ecosystems and habitants affected by our
actions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that effective mechanisms would be put in place by all
parties to implement resolutions of the conference.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the conference and Zimbabwe's Ambassador to the U.N.
Tichaona Jokonya described the conference as an overwhelming success.
</P>
<P>
He said the trends at the 10-day event had clearly pointed to an
increasing acceptance by parties of the legitimacy of sustainable
utilisation of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
The next CITES conference will be held in Indonesia in 1999.

<HEADLINE> All People Should be Involved for Earth Summit Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- All people should be
involved to achieve sustainable development and meet other goals
set at the Earth Summit five years ago, according to the
Worldwatch Institute.
</P>
<P>
The Worldwatch experts reported here today that so far
governments had fallen short of the goals agreed to by more than
100 world leaders in 1992 at the historic Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, human numbers had grown by 450 million, over
100,000 species of plants and animals had been lost, and annual
emissions for carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, the leading green
house gas, had climbed to all-time highes, the Worldwatch experts
noted.
</P>
<P>
Failure to achieve the Rio agenda could be seen in weak
implementation of the conventions on climate change and biological
diversity, and the lack of financing for various initiatives to
promote sustainable development, the Worldwatch experts said.
</P>
<P>
The budgets of the UN Development Program and Environment
Program had stagnated since Rio, and the Global Environmental
Facility, the major financial institution set up to support the
Rio agenda, had a 1996 budget of just 315 million dollars,
slightly below the 1992 budget of 322 million dollars, and less
than one-sixth the annual R &AMP; D budget of the Microsoft
Corporation, the Worldwatch experts added.
</P>
<P>
If the economy was to be put on a sustainable footing in the
twenty-first century, it was unlikely to be the result of a
top-down, centralized plan; the answer was more likely to lie in an
eclectic mix of international agreements, sensible government
policies, efficient use of private resources and bold initiatives
by grassroots organizations and local governments, the Worldwatch
experts said.

House will compile a report on the board's recommendations for

<P>
"Because of America's volatile history involving race, we
believe it is critical to the future of our country to foster an
honest and straightforward dialogue among the races," said Waters,
who was backed by 20 caucus members at a news conference. "America
must confront and deal with the attitudes and beliefs that one
individual or individuals are superior to another."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls for Solutions to African Refugee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata today called on African
people and their leaders as well as the international community
to work together to find solutions to the African refugee
problems.
</P>
<P>
She made the appeal in a statement available here today to
mark the Africa Refugee Day, which falls on June 20.
</P>
<P>
She said "let us work together, only then can the underlying
problems be addressed and future conflict be prevented."
</P>
<P>
She called on African people and their leaders to preserve the
institution of asylum and to continue to offer refugees a truly
safe haven as long as they cannot return home in peace.
</P>
<P>
"Africa has a tradition of hospitality and generosity of which
we are all proud. Don't let this tradition slip away, even when
you are trying to cope with your own problems," she said.
</P>
<P>
Ogata also urged the international community to increase its
assistance to countries receiving refugees, saying that "the
burden must be shared."
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's Africa Refugee Day -- "together in
the search of solutions" -- should turn 1997 into a year of
repatriation in peace and dignity in as many parts of Africa as
possible, she noted.
</P>
<P>
Ogata hoped for an end to the terrible suffering in the Great
Lakes region, peace to take root in countries such as Angola,
Liberia and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Of the about 13 million refugees throughout the world, 5.6
million are Africans, constituting 42 percent of the total.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Motherland Party Leader Assigned to Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel today appointed Mesut Yilmaz, leader of the main
opposition Motherland Party (ANAP) to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the press center of the presidential
palace said that Demirel gave the mandate to Yilmaz to form the
55th government following his consultations with political party
leaders of the country.
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that Demirel asked Yilmaz, head of
the second largest party in Turkey after the Welfare Party (RP),
to form the government in a bid to eliminate the increasing
tension in the country.
</P>
<P>
Following his 45-minute-long meeting with Demirel, Yilmaz told
reporters that he will try to form the government in the
swiftest and quickest way.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said that the nomination by Demirel is in compliance
with the democratic practice and the Turkish constitution.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, when the cabinet formed by the first
party resigns, the mandate for forming a new government should be
given to the second largest one.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish constitution also requires a designated prime
minister to form a new government within 45 days.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz is expected to hold talks with some social democratic
parties such as Republic People's Party (CHP), Democratic Left
Party (DSP), some DYP defectors and independent deputies in a bid
to drum up support for a broad-based new government.
</P>
<P>
If the new government failed to win a vote of confidance in the
parliament, then the mandate will naturally go to the DYP
Chairwoman Ciller, as her party is the third largest in the
550-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
In that case, the political dilemma will remain as it was when
RP leader Erbakan was forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Necmettin Erbakan, first Islamist prime minister
of Turkey, presented his resignation to Demirel and asked him to
appoint center-right True Path Party (DYP) leader Tansu Ciller to
form the new coalition government with the RP and with the support
of the Grand Unity Party (BBP).
</P>
<P>
Erbakan resigned because of the pressure from the military which
accused him of encouraging Islamic fundamentalist groups, posing
a serious threat to Turkey's secular system enshrined in its
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Repeatedly voicing their grave concern over the expansion of
fundamentalism in Turkey, the General Staff of the Turkish Armed
Forces has been exerting pressure on the RP-DYP coalition
government, resulting even in a military coup rumor in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
At a National Security Council meeting in February, generals
led by Chief of General Staff Ismail Hakki Karadayi, demanded the
coalition government to take tougher measures against the
fast-increasing fundamentalist influence in this secular republic
but they were frustrated with the reluctance of Erbakan to curb
the Islamic radicals.
</P>
<P>
The ANAP and the DYP formed a minority coalition government in
March 1996 following the elections. But they proved to be rivals
rather than partners as the ANAP did not help stop parliament
motions against Ciller over alleged irregularities at the
Electricity Distributing Company (TEDAS), concerning corruption
allegations during the sale of state-owned shares of Turkey's
leading automobile plant TOFAS and for an inquiry into Ciller's
assets.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the ANAP-DYP coalition government collapsed on
June 6, 1996 after it lasted only for three months, clearing the
way for the coalition government of RP and DYP.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say the appointment of Yilmaz by the president
is just the outcome the military wanted though the president acted
according to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The move outraged the RP and the DYP which claimed that the
designation is against the democratic rules and accused the
president of staging a coup.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister resigned and a new one selected, but the
politicians are still in a quagmire which is not easy for them to
get out.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Leader Vows to Press for NATO Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Prime Minister Victor
Ciorbea said today his country will keep on pressing for the entry
into NATO until a summit next month in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to act until the time of the Madrid meeting to
have a very wise decision taken there. This is our duty toward our
own people and toward those who support us," he told reporters
before his meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
He added that he was convinced his country would eventually
become a part of the alliance even if it was not invited at the
July 8-9 Madrid summit.
</P>
<P>
The United States said last week that it favored only Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic to become the new members in the
first round of invitation to the alliance.
</P>
<P>
"We have been saddened by the (U.S.) decision," Ciorbea said.
"At the same time, obviously we are very interested to develop a
strategic partnership between our two countries."
</P>
<P>
Cohen indicated that the United States did not say "no" to
Romania's entry into NATO last week, just said "not yet." He said
he must make it "perfectly clear."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Begins Survey on Number of Languages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A survey to ascertain the actual
number of languages in Nigeria has been kicked off in a bid to
facilitate their development, the Nigerian Educational Research
and Development Council (NERDC) said today.
</P>
<P>
The number of languages in the country is currently put at 250
and 300, but it might be incorrect, according to NERDC Executive
Secretary Uduogie Ivowi.
</P>
<P>
As part of efforts to make the speaking and writing of the
languages easy, the council has developed orthographies for 42
Nigerian languages and published manuals on them.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing orthographies for another set of six languages,"
Ivowi said, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
According to him, NERDC has established a data base of
Nigerian languages and dialects with information on the
population of speakers and users as well as their geographic
spread.
</P>
<P>
The scholar is in favor of teaching school children in the
mother tongue, saying that it would spur better comprehension and
understanding, especially of technology comprehension.

<HEADLINE> Leaders of G7, Russia to Open Summit in Denver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DENVER, Colorado, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the seven
Western industrialized countries and Russia open their summit
meeting here today to discuss the major economic and political
issues.
</P>
<P>
The summit is hosted by U.S. President Bill Clinton and
attended by leaders from France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada,
Japan and the president of the European Council.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin also will attend the annual
summit from the beginning for the first time rather than being
relegated to a subsidiary role of joining the summit after the G7
economic agenda is completed.
</P>
<P>
Major economic issues on the agenda of the 23rd summit are
globalization, macro-economy in the U.S. and Europe, promoting
economic development in Africa, integrating Russia into the global
economy, reducing the threats to the global financial market and
the retiring baby boomer in the next century.
</P>
<P>
The summit opens at a time when the U.S. economy is on a modest
but stable expansion while some European nations including Germany
are in great difficulties with high unemployment and huge
government deficits.
</P>
<P>
In a scene-setting speech here Thursday, Clinton urged the G7
industrialized nations to follow the U.S. example and strengthen
the economies by abandoning "old ideas" and cutting the deficits.
The G7 leaders will have something to agree upon on the
macro-economical issues.
</P>
<P>
But there is also something to be at odds between the Western
industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has said that Japan
wanted assurances from G7 leaders that Russia would be kept out of
key meetings on financial and macro-economic matters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the question of how to bring about growth and
stability in Africa will be featured during the summit and the
U.S. and France will express their different prescriptions on the
issue.

<HEADLINE> Donors Conference for Bosnia Canceled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A late-June international
conference to assist Bosnia has been canceled due to the failure
of the country to reach an agreement with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
A statement released today by the World Bank and the European
Commission, which has organized the June 24-25 conference, said
that the participants had been informed "that the donors
conference has been canceled because, in the eyes of the donor
community, there has not yet been sufficient progress towards an
IMF agreement."
</P>
<P>
"As of this date, the donors conference has not been
rescheduled but should the recent rapid progress continue..., it
could take place in Brussels before mid-July," said Donato
Chiarini, head of the EC office in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The IMF agreement is just one of the preconditions set by the
international community for convening the donors conference which
aims to raise reconstruction funds of 1.4 billion dollars for
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Under heavy pressure from the international community, the
Bosnian parties have recently met most of the requirements such as
an agreement with the World Bank and the adoption of a package of
basic economic laws.
</P>
<P>
An IMF agreement is essential to boost the donors' confidence
in the economic future of Bosnia and a prerequisite to successful
negotiations with the Paris and London clubs of official and
commercial creditors on debt reduction and rescheduling, the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Meteorological Satellite Sends Back First Cloud Picture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Meteorological
Satellite Ground Station received a clearly visible cloud picture
from a newly-launched meteorological satellite at 13:30 Beijing
time today.
</P>
<P>
This is the first cloud chart sent back to the Earth by Fengyun
2, a meteorological satellite launched on June 10 and successfully
stationed over the equator at 105 degrees east longitude a week
later.
</P>
<P>
The chart is believed to be another important achievement
Chinese scientists have scored so far with the Fengyun 2. The
successful processing of the picture proved that the multi-channel
scanning radiator, and instruction and data receiving station of
Fengyun 2 were operating normally.
</P>
<P>
The picture was received by the National Meteorological Bureau
and a team from the China Aerospace Corporation (CAC) during an
orbital test.
</P>
<P>
The scanning radiator of Fengyun 2 can view one third of
the Earth from a height of 35,800 kilometers, and can produce a
cloud picture every 30 minutes, allowing it to monitor weather
changes as they occur.
</P>
<P>
Fengyun 2 is the first meteorological satellite developed by
China that is in synchronous orbit with the earth. Covering about
100 million square kilometers of earth surface with China at the
center, Fengyun 2 can provide meteorological information such as
cloud pictures, temperatures, and wind movements over China and
its neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> MP: Israeli Cabinet Crisis Deepens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (Parliament) member
Abdul-Wahab al-Darawsha said today the Israeli cabinet is going
through an aggravated crisis.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Cairo-based Voice of Arab radio, Darawsha,
who leads the Arab Democratic Party, said the recent resignation
of a Likud minister risks withdrawal of the Russian immigrants'
Yisrael Be'aliya Party and the centrist Third Way from the ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Finance Minister Dan Meridor resigned Wednesday after
an overnight seven-hour cabinet meeting on currency reforms,
saying that he had lost confidence in Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The crisis in the Israeli coalition has deepened, as two
ministers boycotted cabinet meeting Friday and the oppositions
are trying to secure a vote of no confidence in the Netanyahu
government.
</P>
<P>
Darawsha described the current crisis as "the negative
consequences of the policies" followed by Netanyahu on the
political and economic levels.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu's line of action vis-a-vis the Arab-Israeli
peace process raises stakes of more damage to the Israeli
ruling coalition," said the Israeli legislator.
</P>
<P>
But he ruled out the possibility that the Likud government may
not survive the no-confidence vote to be held at the Knesset next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition must win 61 votes in the 120-seat parliament to
bring down the government. Yisrael Be'aliya holds seven of the
coalition's 66 seats in the parliament, and the Third Way has four.
</P>
<P>
According to an opinion poll broadcast on Israel's Channel 2,
up to 61 percent of Israelis have no confidence in
Netanyahu. While another poll, conducted by an Israeli daily, said
51 percent support early elections in their country.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 no-confidence motions have been defeated since the
Likud government took office last year.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' House President Cautious Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' House of Representatives
President Spyros Kyprianou has expressed reservations about the
the forthcoming U.N.-sponsored direct talks between leaders of the
Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus, Cyprus News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou was quoted as saying that it is unrealistic to expect
Turkey to abandon its "expansionist policy" in Cyprus with "simple
advices."
</P>
<P>
"We have many reservations and fears about the talks
scheduled to begin on July 9 in New York," he said in an interview
with New York "Aktina FM" Greek Radio Friday.
</P>
<P>
Despite these, he noted, "we unanimously agree that (Cypriot)
President Clerides should attend direct talks and with good will
to make every effort so that progress on the protracted Cyprus
problem is achieved."
</P>
<P>
The House President noted that the U.S. and the European Union
(EU), both having close ties with Turkey, have "great
responsibility" in influencing Turkey in a correct way.
</P>
<P>
Both Clerides and the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash have
accepted the U.N. invitations to attend the face-to-face talks
designed to help break the stalemate in the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops had occupied the northern
third in the wake of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash had two informal meetings in Nicosia
under the U.N. auspices, in October 1994, which ended in a
deadlock. They have not met ever since.

<HEADLINE> A Forward Movement in Pak-India Talks: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 21 (Xinhua) -- There has been a "forward
movement" in the current round of foreign secretary-level talks
here between Pakistan and India, a Pakistani Foreign Ministry
spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, there has been a forward movement in today's
talks," the spokesman told a press briefing here. The present
round of India-Pakistan talks began yesterday and is scheduled to
conclude on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It was decided in today's session that each side will set down
its proposals in the form of working papers," the spokesman said.
"The two sides will work on those proposals tomorrow in an effort
to produce an agreed document."
</P>
<P>
The discussions were held in a "friendly atmosphere" and the
ideas of the two sides on various issues have now been
crystallized, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Indian Foreign Secretary Salman Haider, who
is leading the Indian delegation to the talks, called on
Pakistan's President Farooq Leghari and Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif.
</P>
<P>
At the meetings, both Leghari and Sharif emphasized the need to
work for the resolution of all outstanding issues between Pakistan
and India.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Nemtsov: Russian-Chinese Cooperation Has Great </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia will consolidate the results
of visit of Chinese President Jiang Zemin to Moscow with concrete
accords, Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov told
Chinese reporters Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Chinese journalists based here, Nemtsov
said that he leaves for Beijing Monday to prepare for the visit of
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
"I am a little excited, thinking about the visit to Beijing,"
Nemtsov said, "because it is my first visit to China. I knew long
ago that Chinese people are brave, industrious and honest."
</P>
<P>
During the visit of the Russian Premier to China, according to
Nemtsov, he is expected to sign with Chinese officials a package
of agreements, concerning, among others, energy, electric power,
traffic and trade.
</P>
<P>
Nemtrov believed that the projects, such as extracting and
providing for China national gas from Irkutsk region and oil from
East Siberia, as well as building a national gas pipeline passed
through Mongolia and China to East Asia, have a great significance
to economic development for both countries and the East Asian
region.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Russia and China should actively enlarge their
exchanging fields of industry and investment.
</P>
<P>
Some leaders, bankers and bosses of large companies from the
Russian border areas will also go to Beijing with him, Nemtsov
said.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov said that Russia exceeds other countries in economic
cooperation with China, for the two countries have more than 4,000
kilometres of common border, and there are plentiful resources in
the Far East area of Russia, and the two countries have
traditional relations of friendship.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Russian "East policy", Nemtrov said that
Russia sees the world as a multipolar and denies the right of some
big powers to govern the world. It is equally important for Russia
to cooperate with East, West and South, he added.

<HEADLINE> People across China Celebrate Hong Kong's Return Coming in 10 Days. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- It's just 10 days till Hong Kong
returns to the motherland, which means 10 days full of
celebrations and activities for Chinese people of all ages and
walks of life.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 college students from a dozen of Beijing-based
universities wrote heart-felt words on a 100-meter banner as a
gesture of goodwill for the return of Hong Kong to the motherland
on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The students, from Northern China Jiaotong University, People's
University of China, and the Central University for Nationalities,
will give performances on the evening of June 30 at Tiananmen
Square.
</P>
<P>
In another academic-related event associated with Hong Kong's
return, a seminar on the Treaty of Nanking was held today in
Nanjing, the capital city of east China's Jiangsu Province. Nearly
100 historians and experts discussed the impact of the Treaty of
Nanking -- the first unequal treaty signed in Chinese modern
history -- under which Hong Kong was ceded to Britain.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed that Hong Kong's return was the result
of the successful practice of Deng Xiaoping's theory of "one
country, two systems." They also proposed that the 1,000-plus
out-of-date treaties signed in Chinese modern history should be
studied, and a new area of research should be developed to cover
the Opium War (1840-1842) and the nation's modern history.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, 100 workers who are skillful at calligraphy wrote
the Chinese character for "return" 100 times in different styles
on a 97-meter white scroll. The scroll will be stored by Shanghai
Museum as a momento of Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Fifty well-known Shanghai-based artists and calligraphers
together painted a picture on a scroll with 1,997 centimeters in
length and 66 centimeters in width today.
</P>
<P>
And Hong Kong's neighboring city of Shenzhen held an exhibition
on the flood relations between people of Shenzhen and Hong
Kong. Some 5,000-6,000-year-old cultural relics as well as
pictures illustrating the economic ties between the two places
were on display.
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan Hsu Lai Tai, President of the Provisional Legislative
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, viewed the
exhibition.

<HEADLINE> Projects Underway to Improve Tie Between Shenzhen, HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, the only city with land
links to Hong Kong, is making greater efforts to ensure a smoother
flow of people and goods between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
A number of projects are underway for the purpose, including
restructuring of the city's traffic-ways.
</P>
<P>
Since Shenzhen was named a special economic zone (SEZ) in 1980,
it has invested two billion yuan to build up two land ports, seven
sea ports and an airport, and expand two other land ports.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 63.21 million people entered and departed from local
ports in Shenzhen, accounting for 45 percent of the country's
total. And 8.53 million vehicles came into and out of the ports,
according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has served as a bridge between Hong Kong and inland
areas; 80 percent of the container-trucks going to and departing
from Shenzhen's ports are working for the Zhujiang River Delta
area and inland provinces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 60 percent of foreign trade goods in Shenzhen come
to or from inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming return of Hong Kong will make the economic ties
between the two places even closer, which in turn will accelerate
the transport volume between the two areas.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates by local experts, by the year 2000, the
land traffic volume between Hong Kong and Shenzhen is expected to
reach 68,000-70,000 vehicles per day, more than double the present
32,000 vehicles daily.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong returns to the motherland, Hong Kong and
Shenzhen are expected to work together on traffic-improvement
projects, including construction of a large highway bridge across
Shenzhen Bay to link up expressways on the two sides and the
building of a new waterway.

toward the event, saying they keep "silence towards this
U.S. move."
</P>
<P>
He also criticized some others for according a warm and
friendly welcome to the U.S. defense secretary William Cohen right
after the adoption of the bill.
</P>
<P>
Cohen paid a five-day visit to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain,
the United Arab Emirates and Oman in mid-June, during which he
said Iran is still the threat to the regional security.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani called on the mayors of Islamic countries to voice
their strong protest against the U.S. Congress' move so that the
Israelis would not have the impression that Muslim community has
become indifferent towards this issue.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is revered among all Mulims as the site from which
Prophet of Islam, Muhammad, ascended to heaven.
</P>
<P>
More than 180 officials from 46 Islamic countries are
attending the three-day OICC gathering in Tehran to discuss city
planning, urban problems, environment protection and host of other
issues.

<HEADLINE> Israel Rockets Guerrilla Base in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes carried out at
noon today an air raid at a suspected guerrilla base in south
Lebanon, in an apparent retaliation for an attack on Israeli
occupation forces in the so-called "security zone" in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that the Israeli warplanes launched the
strike at 12:15 a.m. (0945 GMT) in Iglim Al-Toffah, a ridge some
65 kilometers southeast of Beirut which is often used by Muslim
guerrillas as a springboard to attack the Israeli self-carved
buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
The 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone" was declared by
Israel in 1985 in a pretext to protect northern Israel from
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Israel fighter-bombers fired two air-to-surface missiles
on the hill of Tellat Mlita in the area, the security sources
added, noting that no casualties were caused.
</P>
<P>
The air raid followed, and was followed by, artillery
bombardments at the heights and reconnaissance flights of Israeli
warplanes over the area, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Radio of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia
confirmed that the Israeli position of Bir Kalab deeply inside
the border strip had been attacked by guerrillas, but denied any
casualties.
</P>
<P>
In another development, six Irish soldiers of the U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which is engaged in a peacekeeping
mission in south Lebanon, were wounded this morning as a result
of a mine explosion in the area of Beit Yahoun.
</P>
<P>
The six have been hospitalized in a field of the
multi-national forces in the south Lebanese border town of
Naqoura, and UNIFIl's spokesman Timor Goksel said that two soldiers
were in serious state while the four others were slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
Goksel said that the soldiers were wounded when patrolling a
road in Beit Yahoun inside the Israeli-occupied enclave "after
the UNIFIL was informed by the Israeli side that the road was
free of mines."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. force, comprising contingents from Fiji, Finland,
France, Ghana, Ireland, Italy, Nepal, Norway and Poland, was set
up in 1978 following the first Israeli incursion into the country.
</P>
<P>
Since the UNIFIL's installation, some 200 peacekeepers have
died and more wounded in various incidents on the last active
battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict.

<HEADLINE> Nearly Half Overseas Filipino Workers in Vulnerable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 45 percent of overseas
Filipino workers are in "vulnerable occupations," employed either
as domestic helpers or non-professional entertainers, the head of
a House committee said today.
</P>
<P>
Dante Liban, chairman of the House of Representatives Special
Committee on Overseas Filipino Workers, said women account for 95
percent of these vulnerable workers.
</P>
<P>
"Women also comprise the bulk of the estimated 1.8 million
undocumented, illegal overseas workers," Liban added.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Departments of Foreign Affairs and the Department
of Labor and Employment to focus their documentation and
protection efforts on these workers.
</P>
<P>
"Because they can easily be replaced, these unskilled workers
are far more susceptible to abuses by their employers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Liban said about 60 percent of the overseas Filipino workers in
vulnerable jobs are employed as housemaids while the rest are
working as entertainers.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has a total of six million overseas workers in
at least 100 countries and regions. They helped the country build
its economy by remitting 750 million U.S. dollars back last year.
</P>
<P>
However, cases of abuses against them have been increasing in
the past few years. It was reported that every day two overseas
Filipino workers died of abuses or in accidents last year.
</P>
<P>
At present, dozens of overseas Filipino workers are crying for
help in jails. How to help them while maintaining good relations
with these countries has become a headache for the Philippine
government.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Philippines almost severed its diplomatic
relations with Singapore over the hanging of a Filipino maid in
the city state.

<P>
MOGADISHU, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Heavy clashes took place Friday
between the Marehan and Majerten clansmen outside the port town
of Kismaio, 500 km south of Mogadishu, in which eight people killed
and 15 others injured.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the field radios said, the fighting broke out
after the Majerten fighters launched an attack on the villages
formerly controlled by the Marehans and their allied militiamen
from the Habar Gidirs of Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
After a bitter fighting, the Majerten fighters took over the
two villages while the dislodged forces of Marehan clan retreated,
awaiting a chance to counterattack.
</P>
<P>
However, a militia commander from Hussein Aidid's forces has
denied that their aim is to capture the town of Kismaio, saying
their intention is to establish a strong defensive operation so
as to prevent further militia occupation in the territories under
their control by the Majerten clan.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40 people have died and more than 75 others were
wounded since the armed clashes began between the Marehan
and Majerten militiamen over the control of port town of
Kismaio a week ago ago.
</P>
<P>
The Majerten militiamen are loyal to the son-in-law of
Somalia's late dictator General Mohamed, said Hirsi Morgan.

<HEADLINE> Italy Favors Dialogue on Human Rights: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government favors
dialogue and opposes confrontation on the issue of human rights,
Deputy Foreign Minister Patrizia Toia told a Chinese human rights
delegation today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation of the Human Rights Society of China is led by
Zhu Muzhi, who himself is president of the Human Rights Studies
Group. The mission is on the third leg of a four-nation European
tour of Norway, Sweden, Italy and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Toia said that in the field of human rights, the Italian
government is a partner of dialogue and cooperation of China.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said he appreciated the Italian government's stance on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
It is quite normal that the East and the West have different
views on the issue of human rights just as on many other issues,
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The best way is to resolve the differences, he noted, is to
recognize them, find common ground through dialogue and increase
understanding and clear up misunderstanding through cooperation,
and finally reach consensus.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government stands for equal dialogue and
friendly cooperation on the human rights issue and opposes
deliberate confrontation and the imposition of ideas on others.
</P>
<P>
Like other issues, the issue of human rights could be
ultimately resolved so long as all countries engage in sincere
dialogue and cooperation, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Zhu and his delegation held talks with
vice-president of the Chamber of Deputies, Clemente Mastella, and
other Italian officials.
</P>
<P>
The two sides exchanged views on human rights, ethnic
minorities and relations between central and local authorities.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Stresses Need for Water and Soil Conservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun stressed
during a recent inspection tour in northwest China that the area
must conserve water and soil resources and improve agricultural
production conditions.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also a member of Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the trip from June 16 to
21, mainly in Yulin Prefecture and the city of Yan'an in Shaanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
Yulin is located in a transit area between the Muus Desert and
the Loess Plateau, where there was formerly little vegetation and
local villages and farmland were threated by shifting sand.
</P>
<P>
Jiang was pleased to see that vegetation coverage in Yulin was
raised from the 1.8 percent in the early 1950s to 38.9 percent at
the end of last year. And there are 165 large tracts of woods and
four windbreak tree belts with a total length of 1,500 km.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the situation in early 1950s, the shifting rate
of sand dunes has diminished sharply, and the mud flowing into the
Yellow River has been reduced from 530 million tons to 190 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
In Yan'an, a city made famous during China's revolution, 78.4
percent of its area suffers from water and soil losses. By the end
of last year, 62 percent of the area was put under control. The
local ecological environment has been improved markedly and local
people's income raised to great extent.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier praised the local people for their efforts to
improve ecological environment and promote the local economy by
means of comprehensive development.
</P>
<P>
He urged local officials to aid the farmers by stabilizing the
central government's land contract policies.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Coup-makers Call for ECOWAS Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierra Leone
has called for a meeting of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) to discuss intervention in the country's
political affairs.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today said the announcement, broadcast
through the Sierra Leonean National Radio, did not state when the
request was made or if there had been a response from the
regional organization.
</P>
<P>
The news was noted to coincide with the three-hour meeting on
Friday between a Ghanaian delegation and Major Johnny Paul
Koroma, leader of the country's ruling Armed Forces Revolutionary
Council (AFRC), in the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Koroma was formally sworn in as head of state on Tuesday
despite international condemnation of the coup on May 25 that
overthrew the elected civilian government led by ousted President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper "This Day" reported today that the talks
was part of a series of discussions initiated by west African
leaders to press the military junta to hand over power to
Kabbah's government.
</P>
<P>
The talks was held as fighting was reported to be going on in
Kenema, eastern Sierra Leone, between soldiers loyal to AFRC and
the Kamajors, traditional hunters loyal to Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a Kamajor spokesman as saying the Kamajors,
which had not retreated as the military demanded, were advancing
steadily toward Freetown after successfully pushing back the
military government troops.
</P>
<P>
The local militia, the Kamajors, reportedly to have put about
6,000 men on the battle front for the operation since Thursday
morning, vowed to march to Freetown and oust the military
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said the AFRC secretary-general, Abdul
Susey, recommended on Friday the inclusion of Kabbah in round
table discussion in the search for a lasting solution to the
crisis in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Koroma has promised to establish a broad-based government made
up of all parties concerned in an election in due time, despite
growing international pressure to get him step down.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG is enhancing its
military buildup for an intervention in case negotiations for a
peaceful settlement of the Sierra Leonean crisis fail.

ISLAMABAD, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said today there should be meaningful progress in the

<P>
"The progress should be uniform on a broad spectrum of Indo-Pak

began yesterday.

There should be meaningful progress in the talks, Sharif said.

According to a press release, Sharif also called for "reduction
of Indian forces and improvement of the human rights situation" in
the India-controlled Kashmir.

He emphasized that the mutual spirit of the Summit of the South

last month should be maintained to resolve all the outstanding
issues between India and Pakistan.

Salman Haider, while conveying greetings of Indian Prime
Minister Inder Kumar Gujral to Sharif, said Gujral had instructed
him to assure Sharif that India "wanted to open a new chapter in
the relations between the two countries."
</P>

India was aware of Pakistan's "concerns and pre-occupations
which they would try to address with sincerity and honesty," said

previous low level of 4,625 rupees (130.28 US dollars) per ten
gram quoted on June 13.

<HEADLINE> HK Provisional Legislature Holds 12th Meeting in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) concluded its 12th and last plenary meeting here today
before Hong Kong's handover to China.
</P>
<P>
As of July 1, with the meeting venue shifted to Hong Kong, the
HK lawmakers will be relieved of shuttling between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
HKSAR Secretary of Justice Elsie Leung Oi-sie, on behalf of the
Chief Executive's Office, made an Introduction to Hong Kong
Reunification Bill which provides for the confirmation of
legislation approved by the PLC and the continuity of the legal
system and the civil service.
</P>
<P>
One of its major functions was to confirm the validity of the
bills which have been passed by the body before July 1, Leung
said.
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt about the validity of the laws passed prior
to the handover, but the confirmation process on July 1 will serve
as an added assurance, she told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The bill also endorses the appointment of judges of the Court
of Final Appeal and the Chief Judge of the High Court, and
provides for the continuity of legal proceedings, criminal justice
system and administration of justice by stipulating that actions
launched before July 1 will remain valid after the date.
</P>
<P>
Another key part of the bill is to deal with the interpretation
on and after July 1 of laws previously in force in Hong Kong, for
the continuation of those laws and for the confirmation of certain
laws.
</P>
<P>
Leung invited PLC members to give their views for amendments to
the draft bill, which had been published on June 18 by the Chief
Executive's Office.
</P>
<P>
The Office will include the views in the blue bill to be
formally presented to the PLC on July 1 so that it can go through
all three readings in the early hours of the day, she said.
</P>
<P>
The four bills won unanimous support at today's plenary meeting
when they were read for the third time, bringing to 13 the total
number of bills passed before the handover.
</P>
<P>
They are the Immigration (Amendment)(No.3) Bill 1997, the Hong
Kong Court of Final Appeal (Amendment) Bill 1997, the Judicial
Service Commission (Amendment) Bill 1997 and the Oaths and
Declarations (Amendment) Bill 1997.
</P>
<P>
The first three were tabled by the Chief Executive's Office for
first and second readings on June 7 while the fourth one was
tabled on June 14.
</P>
<P>
The Immigration (Amendment) Bill seeks to provide for the
status of a permanent resident together with the right of abode in
the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, there are six categories of permanent residents
who have the right of abode in the HKSAR, as stipulated by Article
24 of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Other major parts of the bill include: to provide for the
circumstances in which the right of abode may be lost and the
right to land in Hong Kong after the loss of such right, to
provide for the transitional arrangements for those who are not of
Chinese nationality but are permanent residents of Hong Kong
before July 1, and to provide for the definitions (or their
amendments) of certain expressions.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal (Amendment) Bill seeks to
amend the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance, enacted in
1995, by including the provision of Article 90 of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The Article provides that the Chief Justice of the Court of
Final Appeal and the Chief Judge of the High Court of the HKSAR
shall be Chinese citizens who are permanent residents of the
Region with no right of abode in any foreign country.
</P>
<P>
The Judicial Service Commission (Amendment) Bill ensures the
smooth appointment of the first group of judges of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
At the HKSAR government inauguration and swearing-in ceremony
on July 1, permanent Judges of the Court of Final Appeal and
Judges of the High Court will take their oaths immediately after
the Chief Executive, principal officials, members of the Executive
Council and members of the PLC, according to a decision made by
the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Legally speaking, members of the Judicial Officers
Recommendation Commission (JORC), an independent body formed under
the Basic Law to make recommendations to the Chief Executive on
the appointments of judges, should have taken their oaths before
making such recommendations.
</P>
<P>
However, this arrangement is impossible on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, the amendment bill includes a
transitional provision to ensure that the recommendations made by
the JORC can not be challenged simply because its members have not
taken their oaths prior to making the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
The Oaths and Declarations (Amendment) Bill aims to implement
through local legislation the provision in Article 104 of the
Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Under the article, when assuming office, the Chief Executive,
principal officials, members of the Executive Council, members of
the PLC and judges and other members of the HKSAR judiciary must
swear to uphold the Basic Law and swear allegiance to the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The bill repeals the colonial oaths and formulated appropriate
oaths in accordance with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
After the full sitting, a subcommittee was formed to scrutinize
the draft Reunification Bill, with Ambrose Lau as the chairman.
Members of the subcommittee met this afternoon with
representatives of the Chief Executive's Office.
</P>
<P>
At lunch time, the PLC Working Group on Administrative Matters
met to review the preliminary designs of the logo of the PLC.

<P>
SEOUL, June 21 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to promote high-tech
manpowers, the South Korean government plans to send 30 officials
to Silicon Valley, the center of U.S. venture businesses, over the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the promotion of information-oriented venture
companies to help foster economic competitiveness has emerged as a
national priority, government officials themselves have to obtain
firsthand knowledge in order to formulate future policies," said
an official of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, the ministry has decided to send a group of
30 officials including those from other agencies to Silicon Valley
until the year 2000, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The government will also set up an educational program at the San
Francisco-based high-tech industrial center to foster South Korean
entrepreneurs and would-be start-ups.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ministry plans to operate advisor groups to
help invigorate the nation's venture firms both at home and in
Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
By linking up with prestigious universities from around the
region, the ministry will provide a training program for high-tech
start-ups and some 1,500 South Korean businessmen and technology
experts between now and the year 2002.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Light Up to Celebrate July I Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The decorative lights and neon
signs of Hong Kong's famous waterfront skyline will be illuminated
on the night of July 1 to celebrate Hong Kong's return to China,
the Better Hong Kong Foundation (BHKF) announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Chief Executive of the BHKF
Leonie Ki said this will be the biggest laser display in Hong
Kong's history in a dazzling segment of the "Hong Kong 97
Spectacular."
</P>
<P>
She said: "We appreciate your interest in the spectacular,
which will provide the people of Hong Kong with an indelible
memory of our first day of Hong Kong's return to China."
</P>
<P>
The spectacular is the largest ever to be produced entirely on
water, she said, adding that "City of Light -- the laser and light
show, one of five major segments in the spectacular, would pay
tribute to Hong Kong's dynamic cosmopolitan atmosphere and modern
technology."
</P>
<P>
Ki, also Executive Director of the spectacular, said the
spectacular is an hour-long program made up of five major segments
including "Pearl of the Orient," "Sea of Life," "City of Light,"
Unity" and "Celebration."
</P>
<P>
She said the BHKF had received commitments from over 80 percent
of the building owners on both shores of the Victoria Harbor to
participate in the planned July 1 show, noting that the
unforgettable impact will remind everyone of the vitality and
confidence the Hong Kong people have in their future.
</P>
<P>
At the same news conference, Matthew Joscelyne, production
coordinator of "City of Light," confirmed that "it will be the
biggest laser and light show that has ever been staged in Hong
Kong and will be a key element in the Hong Kong 97 Spectacular,
which is the largest show ever to be mounted on water."
</P>
<P>
"City of Light" will be one of the most striking effects of the
evening's program, he said, adding that "we will use six projects,
including two special multi-colored lasers in five locations on
both waterfronts and in the harbor itself, to project hundreds of
laser of laser beams of light," and "use almost 28
computer-controlled searchlights to dazzle viewers in 'City of
Light,' which has been choreographed to music specially written
for the occasion."
</P>
<P>
Joscelyne said the producers, Hong Kong's property industry,
New World Telephone and Hongkong Electric and China Light and
Power, have all worked together to design one of the largest
lighting special effects ever mounted anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
"They will be cued to dim out the outdoor lights and neon signs
in approximately 150 commercial buildings from the Macao Ferry
Terminal, to North point and the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront, just
after the 'Hong Kong 97 Spectacular' begins at 21:00," he said.
</P>
<P>
After the "Sea of Life," an illuminated flotilla of decorated
barges, completes its parades around the harbor and the Karaoke
session -- "Million Singing With One Voice," the "City of Light"
sequence begins, according to Joscelyne. Lasers will burst out
from the "Pearl of the Orient" and radiate toward the darkened
city, he added.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that symbolizing Hong Kong's return to the
motherland, the decorative signs and neon lights of the waterfront
buildings of this vibrant city will be dimmed out and switched on,
and the world will witness a vibrant and breathtaking city "come
alive and enter a new era."
</P>
<P>
This spectacular only is one of series of local people's
celebrations for Hong Kong's historical return to China.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Maintains Good Public Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Current public security in Hong
Kong is good, with the crime rate plunging 16 percent in the first
five months of this year, local police said.
</P>
<P>
"Compared with other densely-populated cities, Hong Kong
remains one of the most secure places in the world," Commissioner
of Police Eddie Hui Ki-on told Xinhua in an exclusive interview.
</P>
<P>
He said that last year the overall number of crimes plummeted
by 14 percent from 1995 and the crime rate by 16.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
"There were only 1,253 crimes for every 100,000 people, the
lowest figure over the past 15 years," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the police force achieved a case-solving
rate of 51.5 percent, one of the highest figures in the world.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Hong Kong society is stable and this has
created favorable conditions for the smooth return of Hong Kong to
the motherland," he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Official on Lifting of Ivory Trade Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The lifting of the ban on ivory
trade does not threaten the survival of the African elephant,
said Kenyan Wildlife Service Director David Western.
</P>
<P>
David Western said that although Kenya lost in the hotly
contested lifting of the ivory trade ban, it's happy that
international monitoring for illegal poaching continues to be in
force, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan official made the remarks Friday on his arrival
from Harare, Zimbabwe, where he had attended the U.N. Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The rules are very stringent. The nations can only dispose of
their stockpiles after a 21-month moratorium," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana won a proposal to sell their
ivory conditionally at the Harare meeting where Kenya and the
United States were probably the only nations opposed to the
trade.
</P>
<P>
However,"there was very strong African support for the
downlisting. And there was great deal of groundwork," said
Western.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's fear is that the resumption in trade threatens to
precipitate the wanton poaching that almost wiped out Africa's
elephant and rhino populations in the 1970s and 1980s until the
ban was imposed in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The decision at the CITES meeting was not exactly what kenya
wanted but also "definitely not what the southern African nations
proposed... it was a compromise," he said.
</P>
<P>
African nations are likely to meet in Nairobi in the next two
months to review the Harare decision.

<HEADLINE> Uganda: Egypt's Nile Water Quota Unchallenged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has cleared up doubts that some Nile basin countries are acting to
limit the flow of the river to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Arabic Al Ahram newspaper published
today, Museveni hailed cooperative relations between Egypt and his
country and said he seeks to tighten the ties.
</P>
<P>
Ruling out the possibility of reducing Cairo's share of Nile
River water, he said that Uganda has plenty of water as it hosts
the spring of the river.
</P>
<P>
"We receives more water than Egypt so there are no attempts to
diminish water reaching Egypt," he added.
</P>
<P>
As Ethiopia is considering building four dams along the Blue
Nile in addition to other water utilization works of other Nile
basin states, suspicions arise that Egypt's quota of water will be
lowered.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan president described the situation as just
"misunderstanding." He added that his country depends on the
rainfall for irrigation and the Nile water represents just a
reserve.
</P>
<P>
"All such fears are not correct," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Egyptian government also denied any contact
between Cairo and any Nile basin state to rearrange the water
share.
</P>
<P>
The only agreement in place on the Nile dates back to 1959,
under which Egypt has access to 55.5 billion cubic meters, or 99
percent, of its sweet water resources.
</P>
<P>
The Nile basin is home to Egypt, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda,
Rwanda, Eritrea, Burundi, Kenya, Zaire and Ethiopia.

toward this event.
</P>

former president said. "China's achievements in its modernization
drive is encouraging, and its reform in the past decade and more
has played an important role in the industrial, financial and
economic growth of Hong Kong."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Provisional Legislature Almost Fulfills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Lawmakers for the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) have fulfilled the bulk of
their pre-handover tasks as they wrapped up a series of 12
meetings in this southern Chinese city today.
</P>
<P>
The 60-member Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) ended its
last plenary meeting here today, passing the third reading of four
more bills. So far the interim legislature has endorsed 13 bills,
which are believed to be indispensable to the establishment of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Exactly six months have elapsed since December 21, 1996, when
the interim body was elected by a 400-strong Selection Committee,
which was also responsible for the selection of the first Chief
Executive of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
"The PLC was not a best option, but it was the best option
under the circumstances," said Rita Fan, president of the interim
body. The situation was that the "through train", namely, all the
60 legislators of the 1995 Legislative Council to remain in
session after July 1, 1997, was derailed by the unilateral action
taken by the British side. To avoid the legal vacuum after July 1,
it is necessary to form a tentative legislative body.
</P>
<P>
In respect for the British rule of Hong Kong before July 1,
1997, the PLC has held all its 12 plenary meetings in Shenzhen,
the Chinese city bordering Hong Kong, over the past six months.
</P>
<P>
The interim legislature had its president elected on January
25, 1997, and then set up two ad hoc groups -- one on rules of
procedure and the other on administrative matters, and based its
Secretariat in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Starting from early April, the PLC passed 13 bills, which are
vital to the smooth operation of the HKSAR government after July
1, 1997. Four bills were passed in the third reading today,
including the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal (Amendment) Bill
1997, the Judicial Service Commission (Amendment) Bill 1997, the
Immigration (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 1997 and the Oaths and
Declarations (Amendment) Bill 1997.
</P>
<P>
Nine other bills had already been endorsed at previous plenary
meetings of the PLC, including Holidays (1997 and 1998) Bill,
Regional Council (Amendment) Bill 1997, Urban Council (Amendment)
Bill 1997, District Boards (Amendment) Bill 1997, the Legislative
Council Commission (Amendment) Bill 1997, National Flag and
National Emblem Bill, Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Bill,
Public Order (Amendment) Bill 1997, and Societies (Amendment) Bill
1997.
</P>
<P>
The legislation approved by the PLC needs to be ratified on
July 1, and then submitted to the Chief Executive for consent
before they become laws.
</P>
<P>
The PLC also passed three motions in respective support of the
Transitional Budget between 1997 and 1998, the appointment of
Andrew IL Kwok-nang as the Chief Justice of the HKSAR Court of
Final Appeal (CFA), and the appointment of three permanent judges
of the CFA and the Chief Judge of the HKSAR High Court.
</P>
<P>
A blue bill, Hong Kong Reunification Bill 1997, is expected to
be gazetted and passed in all its three readings on July 1 to
ratify the 13 bills approved by the PLC.
</P>
<P>
A draft on the Reunification Bill 1997 has been published by
the HKSAR Chief Executive's Office. Apart from ratification of
legislation approved by the PLC, the draft bill also endorses the
appointment of the Chief Justice and judges of the HKSAR CFA and
the Chief Judge of the High Court.
</P>
<P>
It also refers to various transition-related subjects, such as
the interpretation and continuation of the laws already in force
in Hong Kong, the continuity of legal proceedings and the public
service, and the transfer of government assets and liabilities.
</P>
<P>
Elsie Leung Oi-sie, Secretary of Justice of the HKSAR, today
presented to the PLC a consultation paper, hoping to collect views
for amendment of the draft bill. A subcommittee under the PLC was
set up today to discuss the draft bill.
</P>
<P>
To introduce the draft bill to the PLC members at this moment is
to ensure the smooth passage of the Reunification Bill in the
small hours of July 1, 1997, according to the Secretary of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
After July 1, the PLC is expected to enact a law on the
election of the first HKSAR Legislative Council, which should be
established no later than June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The term of the PLC will not extend beyond June 30, 1998. PLC
President Rita Fan said: "When the first Legislative Council is
formed, the PLC will have fulfilled its historical task."

<HEADLINE> E.Africa to Form Zero-Tariff Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, JUNE 21 (Xinhua) -- Three East African countries
planned to form a regional zero-tariff market in three years,
Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Francis Muthaura, Chief Executive of the
East African Co-operation Secretariat, as saying on Friday that
Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania were aiming at the zero-tariff market
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to the East African Development Strategy 1997-2000
paper adopted at a recent regional summit, the three countries
will establish a single market and investment area in the region
within the shortest time possible.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the priority of the strategy paper was the
development of the regional economic infrastructure like
transport, communications and energy.
</P>
<P>
Muthaura disclosed that his secretariat had already identified
some regional designated roads and rail projects and was seeking
financial support from outside.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that these projects would facilitate the free

<HEADLINE> Investments up by 15 Percent in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Investments in the Philippines went
up by 15 percent to 271.1 billion pesos (10.3 billion U.S.
dollars) in the first five months this year, Philippine News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Trade Undersecretary Melito Salazar as saying
the figure was the total amount approved by the country's Board of
Investments, the Philippine Economic Zone Authority, the Subic Bay
Metropolitan Authority and the Clark Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
However, Salazar did not explain how much foreign investments
were included in the total amount. Local economists estimated that
foreign direct investments declined due to the tumble of the
country's stock market in the second quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
Salazar said the Board of Investments led all the agencies with
an investment of 6.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Subic and Clark, two economic zones turned from former U.S.
bases, also witnessed huge inflow of capital, with investments
reaching 240 million dollars and 51 million dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Salazar said the improving investment is an indication the
country is attracting much-needed capital to finance industrial
development and enhance the sustained economic growth.

<HEADLINE> S.African Official Appeals for End to Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- South African Home Affairs
Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi Friday urged the government to take
immediate steps to stop the flood of illegal immigrants and
remove those already in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Pretoria on Friday,
Buthelezi warned that failure to curb illegal immigrants would
impoverish South Africa. If all illegal aliens were removed, the
country's unemployment problem would be closer to a solution, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said the Aliens Control Act might be amended soon to
enact heavy penalties on people employing illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that around 2.5 to 4.1 million aliens are now
in South Africa, with some claiming the actual number as more
than eight million.
</P>
<P>
However, some cabinet members have reportedly suggested
illegal immigrants from neighboring states be treated leniently
as these countries supported the struggle against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
According to Buthelezi, the South African government's
decision last year to grant permanent residence to some citizens
of Southern African Development Community members had resulted in
200,000 applications.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 percent of the applications had so far been
approved, Buthelezi added.

<HEADLINE> Preparations for Forming HKSAR Government Well Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- On February 20 this year, the
State Council, based on the nomination by Tung Chee Hwa, first
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR), formally appointed 23 leading officials of the first
HKSAR government.
</P>
<P>
These officials will assume office on July 1 after Hong Kong
returns to China and the HKSAR is established.
</P>
<P>
Among the incumbent leading officials of the British Hong Kong
government, except one foreign citizen and one who is going to
retire soon, all have been appointed as leading officials of the
HKSAR government and will retain their current posts.
</P>
<P>
This has reflected the sincerity and resolution of the central
government to implement the HKSAR Basic Law and to maintain the
stability of the civil service in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Article 100 of the Basic Law stipulates that "public servants
serving in all Hong Kong government departments, including the
police department, before the establishment of the HKSAR, may all
remain in employment and retain their seniority with pay,
allowances, benefits and conditions of service no less favorable
than before."
</P>
<P>
According to this stipulation, after the founding of the HKSAR,
all its leading officials, including secretary and vice-secretary
of all departments, commissioner of the Independent Commission
Against Corruption, director of Audit, commissioner of Police,
director of Immigration and commissioner of Customs and Excise,
should be nominated by the SAR Chief Executive and appointed by
the Central People's Government.
</P>
<P>
Great efforts were made by Tung Chee Hwa in the course of
forming the first HKSAR government.
</P>
<P>
After being appointed last December by the central government
as the first Chief Executive of the HKSAR, Tung held a series of
meetings with more than 20 senior officials of the Hong Kong
government, and completed the nomination within two months.
</P>
<P>
The first senior official he met with was Anson Chan, Chief
Secretary of the Hong Kong government.
</P>
<P>
On the early morning of December 28 last year, Tung and Chan
had a breakfast meeting which lasted for about two hours. They
discussed a whole range of issues, including the stability and
transition of the civil service, assistance from the Hong Kong
government for the SAR Chief Executive, the Provisional
Legislative Council, and some other questions drawing attention of
the public.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the two walked out with smiling faces to
meet the reporters. Both described the meeting as "very useful and
constructive".
</P>
<P>
Tung told the reporters that the 180,000 civil servants are an
important foundation for Hong Kong's success, and that it was very
important to maintain the morale of the civil service and ensure
its smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that all the civil servants are of one mind, and are
working hard for Hong Kong's future," he said, "We all hope that
the return of Hong Kong will be smooth and successful."
</P>
<P>
He revealed that Chan had accepted his invitation to stay in
the government after the establishment of the SAR. "I am very
delighted," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the following one month, Tung held meetings with 21 other
senior officials of the Hong Kong government.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, each of which lasted more than an hour,
Tung heard reports on the work of various departments, and
exchanged views with the officials on a series of policy-oriented
issues.
</P>
<P>
The issues include Hong Kong's finance, securities, trade,
public security, environmental planning, land supply,
transportation and their prospects.
</P>
<P>
Most of these senior public servants expressed the intention of
serving the SAR government, and none of them expressed worries
about whether they would retain their current posts.
</P>
<P>
As a result of painstaking efforts, on January 24 this year,
Tung announced the nimblest of the members of the first Executive
Council of the HKSAR, the top advisory body for the HKSAR Chief
Executive.
</P>
<P>
Later, he also submitted the namelist of the HKSAR leading
officials to the central government.
</P>
<P>
With the formation of the Executive Council and the appointment
of the SAR leading officials by the central authorities, the power
framework of the HKSAR has taken shape.

<HEADLINE> HK Provisional Legislature Passes Four Bills in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Four bills were adopted today by
the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) which held its 12th plenary meeting
in this South China city.
</P>
<P>
They are the Immigration (Amendment)(No.3) Bill 1997, the Hong
Kong Court of Final Appeal (Amendment) Bill 1997, the Judicial
Service Commission (Amendment) Bill 1997 and the Oaths and
Declarations (Amendment) Bill 1997.
</P>
<P>
The first three bills were tabled by the Chief Executive's
Office for first and second readings on June 7 while the fourth
was tabled on June 14.
</P>
<P>
The four bills, along with nine other bills which had passed
the third reading at the PLC's previous meetings, still have to go
through a confirmation process and gain the Chief Executive's
consent in the early hours of July 1 to become laws.
</P>
<P>
The Immigration (Amendment) Bill seeks to provide for the
status of a permanent resident together with the right of abode in
the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, there are six categories of permanent residents
who have the right of abode in the HKSAR, as stipulated by Article
24 of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Other major parts of the bill include: to provide for the
circumstances in which the right of abode may be lost and the
right to land in Hong Kong after the loss of such right, to
provide for the transitional arrangements for those who are not of
Chinese nationality but are permanent residents of Hong Kong
before July 1, and to provide for the definitions (or their
amendments) of certain expressions.
</P>
<P>
An early legislation on the right of abode which practically
affects everyone in the HKSAR could allay people's concern, HKSAR
Secretary of Justice Elsie Leung Oi-sie told lawmakers when
presenting the bill on June 7.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal (Amendment) Bill seeks to
amend the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance, enacted in
1995, by including the provision of Article 90 of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The Article provides that the Chief Justice of the Court of
Final Appeal and the Chief Judge of the High Court of the HKSAR
shall be Chinese citizens who are permanent residents of the
Region with no right of abode in any foreign country.
</P>
<P>
The Judicial Service Commission (Amendment) Bill ensures the
smooth appointment of the first group of judges of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
At the HKSAR government inauguration and swearing-in ceremony
on July 1, permanent Judges of the Court of Final Appeal and
Judges of the High Court will take their oaths immediately after
the Chief Executive, principal officials, members of the Executive
Council and members of the PLC, according to a decision made by
the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Legally speaking, members of the Judicial Officers
Recommendation Commission (JORC), an independent body formed under
the Basic Law to make recommendations to the Chief Executive on
the appointments of judges, should have taken their oaths before
making such recommendations.
</P>
<P>
However, this arrangement is impossible on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, the amendment bill includes a
transitional provision to ensure that the recommendations made by
the JORC can not be challenged simply because its members have not
taken their oaths prior to making the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
The Oaths and Declarations (Amendment) Bill aims to implement
through local legislation the provision in Article 104 of the
Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Under the article, when assuming office, the Chief Executive,
principal officials, members of the Executive Council, members of
the PLC and judges and other members of the HKSAR judiciary must
swear to uphold the Basic Law and swear allegiance to the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The bill repeals the colonial oaths and formulated appropriate
oaths in accordance with the Basic Law.

LUSAKA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- All stakeholders in Zambia
including the private sector and the environmental council of
Zambia are urged to involve actively in fighting against the
larger grain borer in the Southern Province of the country.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Songowayo Zyambo, Chairman of the

</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the ZNFU has been distributing the chemical,
adding with an appeal to other institutions to help in
distributing Acetellic Super which also works on other pests
before a maize crisis befalls the nation.
</P>
<P>
The larger grain borer attacks maize in storage by turning it
into powder. The pest has been found in a number of districts in
the southern province.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of crude
palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week mixed.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals market ended the week strong with June South
higher at 1,222.50 ringgit (about 489 U.S. dollars) against 1,220
ringgit (about 488 U.S. dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
However, players on the market were bewildered with the release
of bearish production and stocks figures by private crop
forecaster Ivan Wong who anticipated production to slip one
percent to 783,000 tons but stocks are expected to grow to 770,000
tons from the May figures of 711,841 tons released by Palm Oil
Registration and Licensing Authority (PORLA) and exports to slow
down to 615,000 tons from 662,606 tons.
</P>
<P>
The market was also affected by the release of lower exports
figures by a cargo surveyor, Societe Generale de Surveillance
(SGS), for the first 20 days in June at 369,000 tons from 384,000
tons for May 1-20.
</P>
<P>
The market is expected to trend lower in quiet trading next
week as players were worried with the anticipated bearish market
in the intermediate term, market sources said.
</P>
<P>
During the week, the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) was traded
in tight range as gains were capped by losses of three-month tin
on the London Metal Exchange (LME) throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
The market ended the week three Sen lower to 13.83 ringgit
(about 5.532 U.S. dollars) per kg with an accumulated turnover for
the week rising to 487 tons from 480 tons last week.
</P>
<P>
The local metal market is expected to trend sideways in
volatile trading next week, a dealer said, adding any uptrend is
expected to be aided by the LME.
</P>
<P>
On the Malaysian rubber market this week, it was badly hit in
tandem with softer regional markets.
</P>
<P>
July RSS One lost six Sen to 276 Sen (about 110.4 U.S. cents)
per kg from 282 Sen (about 112.8 U.S. cents), while SMR 20 slipped
five Sen to 253.5 Sen (about 101.4 U.S. cents) per kg from 258.5
Sen (about 103.4 U. S. cents) last week.
</P>
<P>
The International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) daily
market price indicator for June 19 stood at 205.37
Malaysian/Singapore cents (Sen) per kg from 207.30 cents (Sen) per
kg on June 18.
</P>
<P>
Five day moving average was at 208.62 cents (Sen) compared with
209.81 cents (Sen).
</P>
<P>
Players are expected to sell their positions next week as they
are frustrated on the current rubber prices, as well as to avoid
further losses as buyers are waiting for lower prices, dealers
said, adding "with no demand, the market plunged further."

<HEADLINE> Former US Chamber of Commerce Chairman Calls for Permanent MFN to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- China should be granted permanent
most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status by the United States, said
James McGregor, former chairman of the US Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here Friday with Xinhua, he added that the
disputes and misunderstandings between the two countries should
not affect China's permanent MFN.
</P>
<P>
McGregor, who is Vice-President (China) of Dow Jones &AMP; Company,
Inc., pointed out that MFN is normal trading rights, and "we
should focus on disputes and misunderstandings between the two
countries in a much clearer way with one issue at a time, instead
of throwing every dispute together under MFN."
</P>
<P>
McGregor called the annual debate over China's MFN a "useless
debate," and stressed this debate has hindered long-term
cooperative plans between business people of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
US policy-makers should be aware that China and some other
developing countries need time to develop, McGregor said, adding
"the progress in China should be measured against what it used to
be, not compared to a fully developed country."
</P>
<P>
US President Bill Clinton announced the decision last May to
extend China's MFN for another year. And the US House Ways and
Means Committee has recently voted in support of Clinton's
decision.
</P>
<P>
McGregor, who has lived in China for 10 years, expressed the
hope that more US congressmen would come to visit China and see
it for themselves. "There is a big gap between their view on China
and the real situation there," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, in the last 12 months, about 20 percent of
the US congress members visited China.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Warn of Clashes in Nablus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians have warned of the
likelihood of serious clashes in the West Bank town of Nablus
today if Israeli forces try to prevent a planned protest gathering
in the city, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The gathering has been called by the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) and opposition groups to protest last week's
United States' decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security forces have informed their Israeli
counterpart that "they could not guarantee their own ability" to
prevent Palestinian demonstrators from entering the
Israeli-controlled Joseph Tomb area in the city.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals in Nablus have reportedly been put on an emergency
stand-by footing, as the Israeli army has been alerted in the
readiness for any possible clashes with the Palestinian
protesters.
</P>
<P>
Violent confrontations erupted in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip following last week's U.S. Congress resolution recognizing
Jerusalem as Israel's undivided capital.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives also voted to set aside 100
million U.S. dollars for moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from
Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, who see East Jerusalem as the capital of
their future state, sharply criticized the resolution, which they
said would hurt the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. congressional resolution about Jerusalem was also
taken by Palestinians as implicit U.S. support for Israel's stand
to create facts on the ground prior to the final status
negotiations which will settle the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio today quoted Israeli army Central Command Uzi
Dayan as saying that eight Israeli soldiers were lightly injured
in the week of violent confrontations with Palestinian protesters
in the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at least 150 Palestinians were wounded, some of
them seriously, by rubber bullets and tear gas fired by the
Israeli soldiers to disperse the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Dayan, who described the situation as tense, added that the
Israeli security forces were prepared to deal with the
possibility that the violent confrontations could spread.
</P>
<P>
He also accused the Palestinian police of not acting to prevent
the Palestinian protesters from reaching the line of the Jewish
community in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Israel security forces blamed the PNA for
"encouraging" the current clashes between the two sides, but the
Palestinians categorically denied the allegation.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's tourism industry has
witnessed a phenomenal growth over the past 40 years, said Donald
Tsang, financial secretary.
</P>
<P>
At Hong Kong Tourist Association's 40 Years of Wonders -- Time
Capsule Launching Ceremony held here today, he said, "Apart from
being one of the most popular and competitive cities in the world
for doing business, Hong Kong is now the most popular tourist
destination in the region and one of the most popular tourist
destinations in the world."

<P>
Hong Kong ranks 8th world-wide in terms of total tourism
receipts and tourism is now the biggest foreign exchange earner
among its services industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
For this year, Hong Kong expects the number of overseas
visitors to surge to a record high of over 12 million, which is
about twice the size of Hong Kong's population, he said.

period of robust growth in tourism, and Hong Kong will continue to
be a place where "Wonders Never Cease".

KATHMANDU, June 21 (Xinhua) -- External and internal stability
in Nepal's economy has promoted investment and economic activities
in the country in the first 10 months of the current fiscal year
ending July 14, Nepal Rastra Bank said.
</P>
<P>
In a press released on Nepal's macroeconomic situation, Nepal
Rastra Bank, the country's central bank, said that while inflation
has dropped considerably this year, the growth rate of government
resources has exceeded that of the expenditure, resulting in a
significant reduction in the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the government account has recorded a cash surplus
amounting to 130 million rupees (about 2.3 million U.S. dollars)
this year as against the overdraft of 1.71 billion rupees (about
29 million U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange reserve level with the banking sector has
been sufficient to cover the current import requirement of six
months, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Total exports this year rose by 14.7 percent compared with 9.9
percent last year. Imports surged by 27.9 percent compared with
22.9 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the country's total foreign trade registered a
rise of 25.2 percent to 97.82 billion rupees (about 1.7 billion
U.S. dollars) this year as against a 20 percent increase to 78.15
billion rupees (about 1.4 billion U.S. dollars) during the same
10-month period last year.

<HEADLINE> India's Investment Outflow Norms Eased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has eased
the norms governing Indian corporates' investment abroad to make
better use of its increasing foreign exchange reserves, a
government official said today.
</P>
<P>
India's foreign exchange reserves have touched the 28.5 billion
us dollar mark and the government has been urged to put the
foreign exchange earnings to productive use.
</P>
<P>
Under the new regulation, authorized dealers (ADs) could invest
in overseas joint ventures and wholly-owned subsidiaries abroad up
to a maximum of 15 million US dollars. The ADs can make these
investments abroad from balances in exchange earners foreign
currency (EEFC) accounts without referring to the Reserve Bank of
India (RBI).
</P>
<P>
"Such investments would be permitted without reference to the
norms and guidelines in the existing policy on investments
overseas," said a Finance Ministry news release.
</P>
<P>
Presently, the RBI allows overseas investments up to 4 million
US dollars based on the export track record of a corporate house.
It has also been stipulated that the investable funds should not
cross 25 percent of the export earnings, accrued in a block of
three years.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the government in its new policy has also allowed
the corporates to invest 50 percent of funds raised through global
depository receipts (GDRs) in joint ventures and subsidiaries
abroad. Such investments will also not be subjected to the
obligation of making equal inward remittances over five years to
neutralize the impact.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a special interministerial committee headed by the
Commerce Secretary will consider investments by Indian corporates
with amounts exceeding 15 million US dollars abroad. The funds
over and above 15 million could be either funded through balances
in EEFC accounts or GDRs. Investments with a sizable GDRs AND EEFC
component will be given priority by the special committee.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization of outward investments by Indian companies
is also indicative of the government's policy to gradually move
towards full convertibility of the rupee.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The following is the gist of
some handover-related commentaries carried by the local press
today.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao today carries a commentary to stress the important
role of Hong Kong's civil servants.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that the 180,000 civil servants constitute
a high-quality and efficient contingent which is a treasure and
the mainstay for future Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It says that from July 1 on, the 180,000 civil servants are
expected to continue their work for the government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and they will face a
new task and new situation after the handover.
</P>
<P>
The civil servants should not worry about their future, the
commentary says, noting that the Basic Law guarantees the
stability of the civil service.
</P>
<P>
It calls on the civil servants to unite under the Basic Law and
to resist the dissension sowed by those with ulterior motives.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that Hong Kong people have full confidence
in the civil servants who are expected to contribute to the
implementation of the "One Country, Two Systems" principle and to
Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po in its editorial today notes the upward trend on the
Hong Kong stock market with the Hang Seng Index surging 647 points
to 15,154 and the turnover reaching 26.5 billion HK dollars
Friday.
</P>
<P>
It says that the records set at the Hong Kong stock market show
overseas funds are flowing into Hong Kong's stock market and one
of the factors is related to Hong Kong's imminent return to China.
</P>
<P>
It cites a report issued by the Standard &AMP; Poor, a well-known
risk and credit rating agency, which expressed its optimism about
Hong Kong's economic and credit strength after Hong Kong's
handover.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that with the closer tie between Hong Kong and
the mainland after the handover, Hong Kong's economy will see
further increase.

<HEADLINE> "One Country, Two Systems" Policy is Wise: Russian Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The policy of "one country, two
systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and "a high
degree of autonomy" formulated by Chinese leaders is a wise one,
according to a senior Russian diplomat.
</P>
<P>
In his office in the Sun Hung Kai Center building near the
Victoria Harbor, Consul-General Kirill Ivanov told Xinhua that
this policy constitutes an important guarantee for maintaining
prosperity of Hong Kong after its return to China.
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining a stable and prosperous Hong Kong is not only in
the interest of China, but also conducive to the stability and
development of the Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that after its return to China, Hong
Kong will play the role as a bridge in Russian-Chinese economic
and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia is ready to continue to increase its
"presence" in Hong Kong and use Hong Kong as a "bridge" for
promoting economic and trade cooperation with China's inland areas
and other countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Consulate-General in Hong Kong was opened in 1994.
Ivanov came here in July 1994 as the first post-Soviet
consul-general. His previous posts were all in Asia, working in
Beijing in the 1960s, and in Singapore and Malaysia in the
following decade.
</P>
<P>
One of his first official activities was to preside over the
establishment of the Russian Trade Association in Hong Kong, which
is dedicated to developing Hong Kong-Russian ties in trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The establishment of the Russian Consulate-General
demonstrates our confidence in Hong Kong's stability and
prosperity after its return to China, as well as in the role Hong
Kong will play in the future."
</P>
<P>
In the past three year, he said, Russian-Hong Kong trade volume
has increased three times, surging from about 400 million U.S.
dollars in 1994 to more than 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1996.
More and more Russian artists, musicians and sportsmen come to
visit Hong Kong, while an increasing number of Hong Kong people
travel to Russia for business and tourism.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia has always regarded Hong Kong as an
international financial, trade, shipping, tourism and information
center.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Consulate-General serves to promote economic and
trade ties between Russia and Hong Kong, and between Russia and
China and the whole of the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Russia is rich in natural resources, has advanced technology
and is a market with enormous potential, he said, adding that Hong
Kong has sufficient funds, a flexible production capacity and rich
managerial expertise.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Hong Kong business community
will invest in Russia's resource-rich Siberia and Far East region.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Russian and Chinese leaders have decided
to forge a strategic cooperation partnership oriented with the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
The two countries enjoy enormous potential in economic, trade
and technological cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been carrying out large-scale economic and trade
cooperation with the northern part of China, but has not done so
with developed provinces in south China.
</P>
<P>
With its special geographic location and unique advantages,
Hong Kong can play the role as a bridge in economic and trade
cooperation between Russia and various provinces in south China,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that cooperation will be very fruitful if China's
inland areas provide land and labor, Russia supplies raw materials
and technology, and Hong Kong provides funds and managerial
expertise.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves $174 Mln Stand-by Credit for Uruguay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) today approved a 21-month stand-by credit for Uruguay
equivalent to some 174 million U.S. dollars, in support of the
government's 1997-98 economic program.
</P>
<P>
But the government of Uruguay does not intend to make drawings
under the stand-by credit, and will treat it as precautionary.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay's 1997-98 economic program seeks to reduce inflation to
single-digit levels by the end of 1998 in an environment of
sustained output and employment growth and to achieve a viable
external position. The program aims at real GDP growth of at least
3 percent in 1997 and 3 percent in 1998, a reduction in the rate
of inflation to 14-17 percent by the end of this year, and a
further strengthening of the international reserve position.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay joined the IMF in March 1946. Its quota in the IMF is
about 314 million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF credit
currently totals about 3 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Wants to Set up Advanced Wood-Based Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Local entrepreneurs should form
partnerships with foreign counterparts to set up advanced
wood-based enterprises to boost wood-based value-added exports,
the New Light of Myanmar today quoted a senior government official
as saying.
</P>
<P>
At an inspection tour to wood-based factories on Friday,
Myanmar Minister for Forestry Lieutenant-General Chit Swe said
that extended production of wood-based, value-added goods in
Myanmar will lead to termination of log exports, especially teak.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is the main teak log exporter in the world.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed the need to strive to set up furniture
and value-added goods enterprises to manufacture more
international class furniture and value-added goods.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar private companies have exported various types of
parquet, door frames and furniture to Spain, Japan, Singapore,
Thailand, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official data, the export of forest
products in the 1996-97 fiscal year increased to about 212.7
million US dollars, representing 24.4 percent of the country's
total export, as compared with over 188 million dollars,
representing 19 percent of the total export in the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Consultation Paper on Reunification Bill Presented To Provisional Legislature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A consultation paper on
Reunification Bill 1997 was today presented to the Provisional
Legislative Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) here in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
The Reunification Bill, to be gazetted and passed through all
its three readings on July 1, 1997, aims to ratify all bills
passed by the interim legislature before June 30 and to deal with
various transition-related matters.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Justice Leung Oi-sie presented to the 60-member
PLC a consultation document, entitled "Introduction to Hong Kong
Reunification Bill 1997". A draft bill was published by the HKSAR
Chief Executive's Office on June 18.
</P>
<P>
Leung said that the Chief Executive's Office will collect views
for amendments of the draft bill so that a blue bill can be
gazetted and passed through all its three readings on July 1.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the 12th PLC's plenary meeting today, the
Secretary of Justice said: "Legislative step is required to
complete the law-making process for the ordinances which have been
passed by the PLC prior to July 1, 1997 and to deal with various
transition-related matters."
</P>
<P>
Upon the establishment of the HKSAR, the laws that have been
passed shall be ratified, reported to the Chief Executive for
signature, proclaimed for implementation so as to complete the
legislative procedure, according to Leung.
</P>
<P>
She stressed: "There is no doubt about the validity of the laws
passed prior to July 1, 1997. However, to make assurances doubly
sure, confirmation of the laws on July 1 will remove any doubt as
to the validity of these laws."
</P>
<P>
Besides, the draft bill endorses the appointment of the Chief
Justice and Judges of the Court of Final Appeal, and the Chief
Judge of the High Court.
</P>
<P>
It also refers to the interpretation and continuation of the
laws already in force in Hong Kong, the continuity of legal
proceedings and in the public service, the transfer of government
assets and liabilities, and the confirmation of the Appropriation
Bill.
</P>
<P>
Leung said that to introduce the draft bill to the PLC at this
moment is to ensure the smooth passage of the Reunification Bill
in the small hours of July 1, 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
He firmly believes the return of Hong Kong to the motherland
will surely help increase the cooperation and exchanges in
education between Hong Kong and the interior area.
Wong holds that teachers are the educational workers at the
frontline, and their attainment and integrity will have an impact
on their students and, therefore, more work should be done to
raise the teachers' competence, enhance their advanced training
and raise their status. Meanwhile, close attention should be paid
to the role of school masters. He said that education of a school
can be run well only with the help of an able and creative school
head.
</P>
<P>
His in-depth understanding of Hong Kong's education system leads
to his belief that Hong Kong now has a contingent of dedicated and
well-disciplined teachers whose relationship with the school
leadership is very close.
Hong Kong has long introduced a nine-year free, compulsory
education, and people have been provided with greater access to
college education. At present, 15 schools are added each year to
cope with the growth in the number of students. Wong pledged his
efforts in running the schools better still, so as to bring up and
train more talents for Hong Kong's future development.
Furthermore, he attached importance to advanced training. Noting
that the present era is one for the continuous growth of
information and science and technology, he said that the
government of the Hong Kong SAR will work out matro-strategic
plans in this regard so that employees will have more advanced
training and retraining to increase their competence.

According to the Commission on Elections, only 25 percent of
the 40 million qualified voters registered on June 14 and 15, the
first two days of a four-day registration of voters.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors Urge Stabilizing Thai Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Foreign chambers of commerce in
Thailand have urged the new Thai finance minister, Thanong Bidaya,
to make stabilizing the baht his first priority, a move which
could pave the way for a reduction of interest rates.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the six-party coalition government to focus on
the country's economic problems, not internal squabbling, to
restore foreign investor confidence in the economy.
</P>
<P>
They made their urges on Friday at a meeting with Commerce
Minister Narongchai Akrasanee, who resigned on Thursday but was
re-appointed to the same portfolio on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mark Israelsen, president of the American Chamber of Commerce,
said that recent political turmoil involving ministers in charge
of economic matters, has discouraged foreign investors from
further investing in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the new finance minister ensure the baht
stability.
</P>
<P>
Thanong, president of the Military Bank, was appointed on
Friday to replace Amnuay Viravan, who resigned on Thursday under
pressure of coalition government parties.
</P>
<P>
Requesting the new finance minister to stick to existing
measures, Israelsen said soon after the pressure on the baht
eases, it should be possible to lower interest rates to boost the
weak economy.
</P>
<P>
Investors are wailing for the new finance minister to make a
policy statement, Israelsen said.
</P>
<P>
He added that investors believe in the long-term economic
fundamentals of Thailand but the government needs to demonstrate
an ability to tackle economic problems with sound policies.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar held earlier this week, some economic analysts
believed that the baht is 10 percent over-valued.
</P>
<P>
Currently the baht is pegged to a basket of currencies
dominated by the U.S. dollar with around 80 percent. The fixed
exchange rate regime has been vulnerable to foreign speculators'
attacks, in particular, since this year.
</P>
<P>
Nimit Nontapunthawat, senior vice president of the Bangkok Bank
Research Department, said the baht should be allowed to move more
to better cope with the country's financial liberalization policy.
</P>
<P>
Supat Julaanatatham, a lecturer at the Economics Faculty of
Thammasat University, said the fixed exchange rate mechanism will
push interest rates up in order to defend the baht from
speculative attacks.
</P>
<P>
This year, the baht has come under periodic attacks from
foreign speculators looking for profits.
</P>
<P>
Supat noted that economic recovery is still far away as long as
interest rates remain high in defense of the baht.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's interest rates are currently the highest in the
region.

<HEADLINE> United Nations Adopts Agenda for Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The General Assembly of the
United Nations today adopted, without a vote, the Agenda for
Development.
</P>
<P>
The Agenda, which was formulated over more than four years,
provides a comprehensive definition of development and synthesizes
the results of various United Nations conferences.
</P>
<P>
It attempts to cover all the development activities of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
It states that development is a multi-dimensional undertaking
to achieve a higher quality of life for all people. Economic
development, social development and environmental protection are
interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
Sustained economic growth is essential to the economic and
social development of all countries, particularly developing ones,
says the Agenda.
</P>
<P>
It would enable countries to improve the living standards of
their people by eradicating poverty, hunger, and by providing
adequate shelter and preserving the environment's integrity.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the adoption of the Agenda, Assembly President
Razali Ismail said it was a tangible effort to address issues
associated with development from a common and collective
perspective of the United Nations, which had a unique opportunity
to act now to make the Agenda operational.
</P>
<P>
It was within the power of member states of the U.N. and the
rest of the global community to ensure its success, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative to the U.N. Wang
Xuexian hailed the adoption of the Agenda as a significant event
in the U.N. system.
</P>
<P>
One of its purpose was to help reverse the unhealthy trend of
placing more emphasis on peace and security to the detriment of
development issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Agenda's adoption did not mean that goals had been
achieved, but was a first step towards achieving it, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The bigger task before the international community was to
effectively implement the Agenda in an integrated and
comprehensive way, instead of a selective implementation
based on the interpretation of a few countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Wang urged the major developed states to show goodwill and
honor their commitments by making the Agenda more than a mere
scrap of paper.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Representative Daudi N. Mwakawago, who spoke on
behalf of the Group of 77, echoed Wang's remarks.
The balance between peace and development was being lost, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the developed countries to have the political will to
support development efforts of the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Brazil, India, Russia, the United States and
18 other countries also spoke at the meeting today.

<HEADLINE> Prospects Bright for Australia-HK Economic Cooperation: Australian Businessman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- "For us, what happens on June 30
is going to be the same as what happens on July 1, and our
business will be done the same way," said Alfred Chown, chairman
of the Australian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong while
commenting on the upcoming return of Hong Kong to China.
</P>
<P>
With more than 1,100 members, the Australian Chamber of
Commerce is the second largest foreign chamber in Hong Kong, next
to the American chamber.
</P>
<P>
"Australian business in Hong Kong is very strong, and Hong Kong
is the largest outpost of Australian business outside Australia,"
Chown noted.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are over 700 Australian businesses registered
in Hong Kong, and the number of Australians in Hong Kong is close
to 30,000. Last year, the total volume of Hong Kong-Australian
trade reached 3.9 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Describing the resumption of exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong by the Chinese government as a major event worth grand
celebrations, Chown noted that the international business
community is very happy with the smooth development of the Hong
Kong handover and transition.
</P>
<P>
"After July 1, I believe that the relationship between
Australia and Hong Kong will go on well, and the prospects for
their economic cooperation and trade are quite good," he said.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that there is a wide scope for economic
cooperation and trade between Australia, Hong Kong and the
interior area of China, and sectors like food, construction
materials, cosmetics, communications, medicine, information and
service could produce great business opportunities for the
Australians.
</P>
<P>
"After the handover, the chamber will continue what it is
doing now, trying to facilitate trade between Hong Kong,
Australia and China's interior area, and helping businessmen and
traders from Australia to come here to do business," he said.
</P>
<P>
The chamber will also try to share information, introduce
people to each other, and lobby the government for policies that
benefit the Sino-Australian relationship, he added.
</P>
<P>
Looking forward to the future of Hong Kong, Chown said that the
return to China will give Hong Kong "a lot of room for growth".
But while maintaining a high degree of autonomy, Hong Kong must
further integrate its economy with that of the Chinese interior
area if it wants to seek greater prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"From the economic perspective, Hong Kong's return to China is
like a fantastic star joining a very good football team," he said.
"If the star and the team work very well together, with the skills
of the star and the talents of the other players, they can walk on
to be a very very strong team."
</P>
<P>
Like many other Australian businessmen, Chown, who started to
serve as chairman of the Australian chamber in 1995, owned
businesses in both Hong Kong and the interior area.
</P>
<P>
Chown expressed strong appreciation for the "one country, two
systems" principle the Chinese government adopted for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very good policy and, so long as it is carried out
in full, Hong Kong will have a great and fantastic future," Chown
said.

<HEADLINE> Leaders of G7, Russia Open Summit in Denver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Denver, Colorado, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the seven
Western industrialized countries and Russia opened their summit
meeting here today to discuss the major economic and political
issues.
</P>
<P>
Hosted by U.S. President Bill Clinton, the summit was attended
by leaders from France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and
the president of The European Council.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin was also present at the opening
reception of the annual summit and will participate in the meeting
from the beginning for the first time rather than being relegated
to a subsidiary role of joining the summit after G7 economic
agenda is completed.
</P>
<P>
Major economic issues on the agenda of the 23rd summit are
globalization, macro-economy in the U.S. and Europe, promoting
economic development in Africa, integrating Russia into the global
economy, reducing the threats to the global financial market and
the retiring baby boomer in the next century.
</P>
<P>
The summit opened at a time when the U.S. economy is on a
modest but stable expansion while some European nations including
Germany are in difficulties with high unemployment and huge
government deficit.
</P>
<P>
In a scene-setting speech here on Thursday, Clinton urged G7
industrailized nations to follow the U.S. example and strengthen
the economies by abandoning "old ideas" and cutting the
deficit. The G7 leaders will have something to agree upon on the
macro-economical issues.
</P>
<P>
There are also matters at odds between the leaders of seven
Western industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has said that Japan
wanted assurances from G7 leaders that Russia would be kept out of
key meeting on financial and macro-economic matters.
</P>
<P>
The question of how to bring about growth and stability in
Africa will be featured during the summit and the U.S. and France
will express their different prescriptions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The three-day summit meeting will end on June 22 after issuing
a long-prepared communique. The summit is also a good chance for
the leaders of the eight countries to meet for talks on the issues
concerning to both sides.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Reshaping State-Owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province has decided to create a two-billion-yuan fund to write
off the bad debts of local state economy, in a recent move to
optimize the assets structure of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is one of the several key industrial bases of China,
and local large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises account
for one tenth of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
However, many local state-owned enterprises have been losing
money since the country launched its market economy campaign.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that the Liaoning provincial government
will take measures to support the ailing state-owned enterprises
to upgrade their technology, introduce overseas investment, and
list themselves on the stock market in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a total of 200,000 workers will be laid off from the
state sector.
</P>
<P>
The province will raise funds for pension insurance, and nearly
96 percent of workers in the state-owned enterprises will be
insured against unemployment risks.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the average assets and liability ratio of the
state-owned enterprises will be lowered by three to five
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> American Motor Voters Didn't Motor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- About 3.4 million Americans
signed up to vote by making use of a law enabling them to register
by mail or while renewing a driver's license.
</P>
<P>
But these so called "motor voters" didn't motor to the polls.
</P>
<P>
Turnout for last year's presidential election dropped despite a
record-high registration, said a Federal Election Commission (FEC)
study.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 73 percent of those old enough to vote were registered
and only 49 percent cast ballots, the FEC said. Four years
earlier, the comparable figures were 71 percent registered with 55
percent voting.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, supporters said, the national motor voter law
passed in 1993 was effective.
</P>
<P>
The law requires most states to let people register at the
local driver's license bureau, when applying for welfare or
disability benefits, and by mail.
</P>
<P>
The change seems to give neither Democratic or Republican
candidates an edge, although the number of people registered as
independents or third-party voters has risen.
</P>
<P>
For President Bill Clinton's second election, the 49 percent
turnout of citizens old enough to vote was the lowest since Calvin
Coolidge was chosen in 1924.
</P>
<P>
The number of registered voters increased by 9.2 million from
1992. The FEC attributed a little over one-third of the increase
to the new law. Most of the rest came from population growth.
</P>
<P>
Forty-four states and the District of Columbia are covered by
the National Voter Registration Act.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Improving the ecology in China's
Heilongjiang province in the past several years has helped
increase the province's grain output, with a yearly average
increase of 10.5 percent in the past seven years, 7 percent more
than the country's average in that time.
</P>
<P>
The province accounted for 19 percent of China's grain output
increase, making it the largest grain producing base in China.
</P>
<P>
It has 130 million mu (8.66 million hectare) of arable land but
used to suffer badly from soil erosion and declining soil
fertility because of over-use.
</P>
<P>
But in the 1990s, an ecological improvement drive was begun,
resulting in 858 model ecological agriculture zones, farm shelter
belts, and a reduction in the pollutants on farmland. Average
grain output in Baiquan county had dropped significantly because
of soil erosion and the worsening environment, but now the grain
production has doubled, after 133,000 hectare of eroded land was
put under control and 72,000 hectare forested.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 2 million hectares of eroded land has been
put under control, and provincial forest coverage has gone from
37.5 percent in 1990 to 41.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Novotna Facing Fixture Overload </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Wimbledon star Jana Novotna was
facing the prospect of six matches in two days on the eve of
Wimbledon as rain forced the pre-Wimbldon WTA event into extra
time on Friday.
</P>
<P>
After rain for the second day running, a Sunday finish is now
planned provided progress can be made with the quarter-finals and
two semi-finals on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
If not, the organizers said they are ready to ditch the 278,000
pound (about 430,000 dollars) event rather than take it indoors at
the nearby David Lloyd Tennis Centre.
</P>
<P>
Czech Republic ace Novotna was just three points from the
semi-final when the rain returned as she led Japan's Ai Sugiyami
6-2, 6-5.
</P>
<P>
Now the 1993 Wimbledon singles finalist must pick up the action
again in search of a last-four clash with either Nathalie Tauziat
or Natasha Zvereva.
</P>
<P>
But she is also involved in the doubles as one half of the
second-seeded team with American Mary Joe Fernandez and they have
also only reached the quarter-finals of that event.
</P>
<P>
The singles top seed and title holder Monica Seles, trailing
5-7, 2-2 to Holland's Brenda Schultz-McCarthy, hopes to retrieve
that deficit and set up a clash with either Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario of Spain or Romania's Irina Spirlea.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- UN agencies warmly congratulated
China for its success in promoting baby-friendly activities,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) and
the World Health Organization (WHO), who had just completed a
12-day inspection of baby-friendly initiatives in China, said in
Beijing yesterday that they were deeply impressed by what they saw
during the assessment.
</P>
<P>
They took detours and made unplanned visits to units and
individuals to get closer to the truth.
</P>
<P>
"With the overwhelming success shown in the Baby Friendly
Hospital Initiative, China is well on its way to showing the rest
of the world that developments in the social sector can and will
keep pace with economic development," said Reshab Mathema, Unicef
representative to China and also head of the international
assessment team.
</P>
<P>
The experts said in the places they visited, there is superb
evidence of the commitment of government, the health system and
many other sectors of society to assuring systematic support to
mothers and babies.
</P>
<P>
The experts also suggested China should consider developing
guidelines for systematic inspection and supervision of marketing
of formula milk. They urged the department of education to
integrate baby-friendly basics into the teaching curriculum from
pre-school to preservice and postgraduate education and training.
</P>
<P>
China launched the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative in
response to a call from Unicef and WHO in 1992. Since then, 6,312
baby-friendly hospitals and health centers have been set up,
making up 42 percent of the world's total.

<HEADLINE> Russia Sees Clear Path to Paris Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DENVER, Colorado, June 20 (Xinhua) -- All the obstacles facing
Russia's entry into the Paris Club have been removed, said a
Russian spokesman here today.
</P>
<P>
"All questions have been solved on Russia's entry into the Paris
Club as a creditor nation," said Sergi Yastrzhembsky, spokesman
for Russian President Boris Yeltsin. He was speaking after a
meeting between United States President Bill Clinton and Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
During their summit in Helsinki in March, Clinton promised
Yeltsin to help Russia join the Paris Club this year.
</P>
<P>
Before their meeting today, Clinton told reporters that Russia
will be "a partner with the other members in trying to help
promote the global economic growth by relieving the burden of the
debt on developing questions."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Clinton discussed European security issues, arms
control and Russia's integration into the global economy during
their meeting today, hours before the opening of the Summit of
Eight in Denver.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told Clinton that he would not go to Madrid to attend
the special summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), which will focus on the alliance's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky told reporters that Clinton expressed his
"complete understanding" about the motives of Yeltsin's decision
of not going to Madrid.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the decision demonstrates that Russia continues to
oppose the NATO's expansion," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
But he added that Russia will be represented at the summit in
Madrid.
</P>
<P>
On arms control, the spokesman said there was no progress.
Negotiations on amending the Conventional Forces Treaty in Europe
were "difficult" and could not be completed before the Madrid
summit, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky added that the talks on the treaty should be
"viewed together with the Russia-NATO Founding Act."

<HEADLINE> Ronaldo Signs Contract with Inter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian striker Ronaldo ended
months of speculation over his future by signing a five-year
contract with Italian club Internazionale on Friday.
</P>
<P>
But Barcelona insisted that Ronaldo still belonged to them,
maintaining that the Spanish Football Federation had not yet
authorised the transfer.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo's agent Alexandre Martins announced the signing in
Santa Cruz, where Ronaldo is playing for Brazil at the Copa
America tournament.
</P>
<P>
Martins said the financial details of the deal would be
announced by the club in Italy.
</P>
<P>
The deal was announced shortly after Ronaldo's lawyer in Spain
said he had paid the four billion pesetas ($27.5 million)
necessary to release the player from his contract with Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
Although the payment technically makes Ronaldo a free agent, a
FIFA circular has decreed that only Spanish clubs are allowed to
sign him without negotiating with Barcelona.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Ricans Criticize US New Act on Puerto Rico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A bill of the United States
on Puerto Rico's status was widely criticized by the Puerto Ricans
at the Special Committee on Decolonization here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bill, known as the Puerto Rico political status act, would
provide for a plebiscite on the political status of Puerto Rico to
be held some time before December 31, 1998, in which the people
would choose between statehood, sovereignty or continuing the
current status of a self-governing commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
A petitioner from the Committee Puerto Rico '98 said the bill
excluded 2.8 million Puerto Ricans living in the United States and
others around the world from voting in the plebiscite, while
foreign-born United States citizens who lived or temporarily
resided in Puerto Rico would be permitted to vote.
</P>
<P>
Iris B. Alfonso, of the United States-based National Congress
for Puerto Rican Rights, said, "We are a colony of the United
States and a territory which, to this day, has not exercised its
right to self-determination. The United States has not complied
with the procedures outlined in the 1960 General Assembly
Declaration on Decolonization."
</P>
<P>
Caros Vizcarrondo Irizarry, of the Puerto Rican Autonomy
Commission, said the U.S. bill called for a status plebiscite
which was a violation of international law and rejected the
legitimacy of the present commonwealth status of the island.
</P>
<P>
Several petitioners said the United Nations should supervise
any plebiscite on the political future of Puerto Rico. Other
petitioners said any dispute over Puerto Rico's status should be
determined by the International Court of Justice.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Promises to Detarget Missiles From Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DENVER, Colorado, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin today promised Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
that Russia will detarget its missiles from Japan for better
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made the promise during a meeting with Hashimoto here
early today before leaders of the G-7 members and Russia open
their three-day summit.
</P>
<P>
"The president told the prime minister that there are former
Soviet missiles still targeted at Japan and that time has come to
take Japan off the targets," a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said that Japan needs to know more
details about the promise.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed to a new plan proposed by Japan to
expand its investment in Russia. Yeltsin promised to improve his
country's environment for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
"Japan wants to normalize relations with Russia fully," the
Japanese spokesman said, adding, "It will take some time to
conclude this issue."
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto told Yeltsin that Russia strengthened its relations
with Western European countries in the West, and "in the East,
Russia can cooperate with Japan," according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which has a territorial dispute with Russia, opposes
Moscow's full participation in the G-7 summit meetings, which are
divided into political and economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said Thursday that he would seek assurances from
other G-7 leaders that Russia would continue to be excluded from
the group's meetings on financial and macro-economic matters.
Russia was not yet ready to join the G-7, and it will probably
take some time for "full integration of Russia into the
international financial system," said a Japanese spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who is excluded from the one-hour-long financial
meeting Saturday during the summit, came to Denver with a hope
that the G-7 will turn into a club of G-8.
</P>
<P>
The G-7, which was initiated in 1975, comprises France, Japan,
the U.S., Britain, Canada, Italy and Germany.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A special session of the
United Nations General Assembly will be convened here next week to
reactivate and intensify international cooperation, mobilize
stronger political will and invigorate a genuine new global
partnership towards achieving sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The UN Department of Public Information reported today that
over 50 heads of state and government, 80 ministers and other
senior government officials will face those challenges during the
19th special session to review and appraise implementation of
Agenda 21 -- the program of action adopted by the UN Conference on
Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The five-day session, also known as "Earth Summit+5," will also
consider for adoption of a three-part document as its proposed
outcome and a political statement which is still to be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
From the perspective of the developing countries, member states
at the special session should renew their commitments to
eradicating poverty, as well as to making new and additional
resources available for implementing Agenda 21.
</P>
<P>
Other priorities are energy and freshwater issues and the
question of transfer of environmentally sound technology to the
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Agenda 21, consisting of a preamble and 40 chapters, addresses
such issues as combating poverty, changing consumption and
production patterns, protecting the atmosphere, combating
deforestation, meeting agricultural needs, sustaining biological
diversity, safeguarding ocean resources, managing hazardous wastes
and ways of obtaining financial resources required to tackle those
problems.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, has published guidelines to
facilitate a smooth and orderly changeover to the use of the euro
in company accounts.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines, prepared by the commission' services in close
cooperation with EU member states and the accounting profession,
aim to help national accounting standard setting authorities and
people compiling and using accounts throughout the EU to prepare
for the drawing up of financial statements in euros.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines confirm that the introduction of the euro will
not require any additional EU accounting legislation or amendment
of existing accounting directives.
</P>
<P>
"These guidelines give practical and comprehensive advice to
standard setters and those that draw up and use company accounts,"
said EU Single Market Commissioner Mario Monti, "and so help them
to ensure a smooth changeover to euro."
</P>
<P>
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, EU commissioner for economic, monetary
and financial affairs, said that these guidelines "fit into the
Commission's overall strategy for EMU preparations."

16 and 17, confirmed the legal framework for the introduction of
the euro, which is scheduled to be launched on January 1, 1999.

<HEADLINE> US Deficit Through May Down 40 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. federal budget deficit
went down 40 percent so far in fiscal 1997 compared with a year
ago, a report from the U.S. Treasury Department said today.
</P>
<P>
The department noted the budget deficit through May totaled
65.4 billion dollars, down from 108.4 billion dollars during the
first eight months of fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
After hitting a record 290.4 billion dollars in fiscal 1992,
the federal deficit steadily declined through last year. The
Clinton administration has forecast a 125.6 billion dollar deficit
in the year ending September 30, still up from 107.4 billion
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the Congressional Budget Office and many private
economists project the imbalance will decline even more this fiscal
year, in part because of the strong economy. Actually, tax receipts
resulting from income and profit gains helped produce the largest
monthly surplus ever in April.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government and congressional leaders have agreed to
balance the federal budget by 2002. The total national debt
currently stands at 5.2 trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the treasury has received 1 trillion dollars
in revenues, compared to 939.2 billion dollars during the first
eight months of fiscal 1996. Spending has totaled 1.1 trillion
dollars, up from 1 trillion dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department said the deficit in May totaled 48.5
billion dollars, down from 53.1 billion dollars a year earlier.
Receipts were 94.5 billion dollars, up from 90.1 billion dollars
in May 1996. Spending totaled 143 billion dollars, down from 143.2
billion dollars last May.
</P>
<P>
The biggest spending categories in May were Social Security,
35.1 billion dollars; Health and Human Services Department
programs, 31.5 billion dollars; interest on the national debt,
27.5 billion dollars; and the military, 25.2 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Against Other Currencies Mostly Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar ended mostly
higher today, helped by a U.S.-Japanese deregulation monitoring
pact.
</P>
<P>
Currency traders interpreted the eased tension as evidence that
the United States won't pressure Japan to raise the yen's value in
order to narrow the widening Japanese trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar settled at 114.81 yen, up from 113.98
yen Thursday and its highest closing level of the week. The dollar
cost 1.7275 marks, up from from 1.7237. The pound cost 1.6559 U.S.
dollars, up from 1.6488 U.S. dollars and the strongest since
January 21.
</P>
<P>
The pound also is viewed as a safe-haven alternative to the
uncertainties surrounding the planned introduction of Europe's
single currency in January 1999. Britain isn't expected to
participate initially in the currency program.
</P>
<P>
Other late-dollar rates in New York compared with late Thursday:
1.4404 Swiss francs, up from 1.4383; 5.8235 French francs, up from
5.8130; 1,688.60 Italian lire, up from 1,686.10; 1.3912 Canadian
