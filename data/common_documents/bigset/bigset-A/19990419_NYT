 By NEIL HOHLFELD  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ Wayne Gretzky wanted Sunday to be a celebration of his
phenomenal 20-year career in the NHL. He wanted cheers, not tears,
as the theme for his final game.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Easier said than done, even for The Great One. In the end, try
as everyone might, it was impossible to hold back the emotions at
Madison Square Garden. Even Gretzky couldn't keep things in check
when the realization hit that he was skating off the ice for the
last time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were tears of joy,'' Gretzky said. ``Up until then, I
was savoring it. I got emotional a couple times at the end there.
You know, it's going to kill me not to play, but time does
something to you and I know it's time.''
</P>
<P>
   After Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr scored in overtime to beat the
New York Rangers 2-1, Gretzky's time was up. It seemed as if a
cold, hard truth suddenly hovered over the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Gretzky was no more. After two decades of rewriting
record books, defining grace and dignity in a rough-and-tumble
sport and putting hockey on the map in the United States, Gretzky
was history.
</P>
<P>
   As he took a brief spin around the ice after the game, tears
started to well up in his eyes. He attempted to choke them back
during an impromptu team photo at center ice. When his two young
sons were brought onto the ice from their front-row seats to join
the photo, emotion overcame Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky twice retreated to the Rangers' dressing room before
coming back for additional trips around the ice. By the end, he was
more composed, smiling broadly, waving to fans and touching the
hands of several youngsters through openings in the glass.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers were tossed onto the ice, and Gretzky picked up a rose.
Tears and roses are not normally associated with hockey, but this
was an extraordinary finish to a career that will have no equal in
the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been pretty welled up with emotion for the last three,
four days,'' said Mark Messier, Gretzky's teammate on the Edmonton
Oilers during the glory days of the 1980s. ``I fought back the
tears a lot today. He was a great player, a great teammate. Just
reflecting on the last 20 years and seeing Wayne and the whole
thing, it has been pretty sad to see it all come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, 38, finished his final season as the Rangers' leading
scorer, but he had only nine goals and 53 assists. It was the first
time in his career he did not reach double figures in goals. In
1985-86 with Edmonton, Gretzky had 215 points on 52 goals and 163
assists. In 1981-82 at the age of 21, he scored 92 goals for the
Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always too soon when you see a great player retire,''
said former Pittsburgh star Mario Lemieux, who retired two years
ago and attended Sunday's game. ``You want them to keep playing and
playing until they're 40, 45 years old. But there comes a time when
you realize you're not the player you were years ago. It's
frustrating for a great athlete to come to that realization, but it
happens to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, Gretzky assisted on the Rangers' lone goal Sunday by
Brian Leetch. Gretzky finished his career with 894 goals and 1,963
assists. That's 2,857 points in 1,487 games _ nearly two points per
game over 20 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   To put things in perspective, Gretzky finished his career with
more assists than any other player in NHL history has points.
Gordie Howe, Gretzky's hero when he grew up in Brantford, Ontario,
is second with 1,850 points.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky had a chance to score the winning goal in his final game
late in the third period, but his quick shot from the right side
was turned away by Penguins goaltender Tom Barrasso.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have been sweet, but he made a good save,'' Gretzky
said. ``With 30 seconds left (in regulation), during that timeout
John (Muckler, the Rangers' coach) called me over and said his
daughter had a baby today in Edmonton. He told me that I was going
to get the game-winner on the day his grandson was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe when I was younger, I might have got that game-winner
for him. But I didn't get it today, and that's another sign that
it's time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jagr is nursing a groin injury and was not going to play in the
season finale in order to rest for the playoffs. When Jagr learned
Gretzky was retiring, he wanted to be part of the historic
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr, who won the NHL scoring crown for the second straight
season, ended Gretzky's career with his 44th goal of the season at
1:22 of overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was fitting that the best young player in the game
scored the goal in overtime,'' Gretzky said. ``Everyone always
talks about passing torches and all that stuff, well, he caught it.
I was happy for Jaromir.''
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake, this was Gretzky's day. He arrived at the
rink with his father, Walter, to complete a cycle that began 33
years ago when Gretzky, at age 5, played in an atom league against
10-year-olds. By the time Gretzky was 10 in 1972, he scored 378
goals with 120 assists in 69 games.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky tells the story that his father once kiddingly told
Wayne's mother to hang up two sheets on the front window instead of
buying drapes because Wayne needed a pair of skates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always tell people that I get all the glory and accolades,
but he deserves it, not me,'' Gretzky said. ``He was a blue-collar
guy who worked 8 to 5 every day and never made more than $35,000.
But everything he had, he gave to his family. Walking in with him
today brought back some special memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the historic arena in midtown Manhattan nearly three
hours before the game, fans lined up to buy commemorative programs
for $10. Others stood in line to pay $5 to have a photograph taken
with a cardboard cutout of Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   There were T-shirts celebrating Gretzky's final game selling for
$20. Gretzky sweaters were going for $160. People were begging to
buy extra tickets to the game; others were quietly trying to sell
them for upward of $500.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sort of hucksterism and hoopla Gretzky wanted to
avoid. He did not want the final stage of his career to dissolve
into a season-long farewell tour.
</P>
<P>
   He politely turned down NHL commissioner Gary Bettman's idea he
should return for the 1999-2000 season, a move that would have
ensured packed arenas throughout the league and increased TV
ratings. Instead, the end came quickly and with as little fanfare
as possible. Gretzky announced his retirement Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The less time to draw attention to himself, it seemed. That, in
a nutshell, was Gretzky's way throughout his career. Before the
game, Bettman announced Gretzky's famous No. 99 would not be worn
by any player in the NHL. As if anyone would have the nerve to wear
that number.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take off that sweater, your jersey, after today's
game you will be the last player in the NHL to ever wear 99,''
Bettman said. ``You have always been and will always be The Great
One, and there will never be another.''
</P>
<P>
   A full hour after the game, Gretzky was still wearing his
uniform while answering questions in a news conference. He was
asked if he was avoiding taking it off for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally I would have changed, but they said you guys (media)
were all waiting, so I came right over,'' Gretzky said. ``Probably
subconsciously I don't want to take it off, though. I'm not going
to put it on ever again. It's hard. I have to be honest, I don't
want to take it off. I haven't wavered one bit since making up my
mind, but that doesn't make this any easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky said that early in his pro career, his father told him
to savor each and every moment on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enjoy every shift,'' Walter Gretzky told his son, ``because
each one brings you closer to your last one.''
</P>
<P>
   The last shift came Sunday, punctuated by the kind of passion
and emotion Gretzky gave to hockey for 20 seasons.

REAL QUIET DISAPPOINTS, BUT KRONE DELIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 MILE-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ Real Quiet disappointed some of his fans
Sunday at Lone Star Park, but Julie Krone made up for it.
</P>
<P>
   Krone, making what she says is her final appearance as a jockey,
won with her first three of five farewell mounts before a crowd of
21,124 adoring fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of everyone here, the day turned out to be a wonderful
experience,'' Krone said. ``I didn't think I would be choked up or
feel that nostalgic about it, but I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The 4-foot-10 dynamo was cheered at every turn, even when she
took a cake in the face courtesy of fellow riders after winning the
third race named the Julie Krone Classic in her honor. Her only
regret shows her competitive side; that she didn't also win with
her final two mounts. She was third on Allen's Oop in the $250,000
Texas Mile, and second on Desert Demon in the $300,000 Lone Star
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   But Real Quiet didn't win the Texas Mile, either. He finished
second to defending race champion Littlebitlively after a stretch
duel.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd contributed to record betting. Local wagering on Lone
Star's 11-race program was $1,723,177, which eclipsed the old
record of $1,692,090 set on the same day in the track's first
season of 1997, when Skip Away turned out for the Texas Mile.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away finished third in that race, and Real Quiet's defeat
Sunday made it 0-for-2 for Eclipse Award-winning racehorses at Lone
Star.
</P>
<P>
   With his trademark move around the second turn, Real Quiet took
Gary Stevens past pacesetting Littlebitlively to a half-length lead
entering the stretch of the Texas Mile. Many watchers, no doubt,
were convinced the 2-5 favorite, who came within a nose of sweeping
the 1997 Triple Crown, had the situation under control.
</P>
<P>
   But Littlebitlively had coasted through slow early fractions _
including a half-mile in 47.26 seconds _ and was full of energy
when Real Quiet rolled alongside. Just like last year, when
Littlebitlively was passed in the stretch by Anet, the tenacious
5-year-old battled back along the rail under Carlos Gonzalez and
claimed a neck victory in the state's first graded stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tough little horse, so I knew there was going to be a
battle,'' said Stevens, riding Real Quiet for the first time. ``He
had a lot of horse coming down the stretch, and so did I.''
</P>
<P>
   Littlebitlively and Real Quiet hit the wire 13/4 lengths ahead
of Allen's Oop in 1:35.65, with a swift final quarter-mile in 24.39
seconds. Local star Mocha Express was a well-beaten fourth in the
eight-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   It was Texas Mile deja vu. A year ago, Gonzalez also was aboard
Littlebitlively, owned by John Franks of Shreveport and trained by
Bobby Barnett. And for the second consecutive time, his
photo-finish victim was a 4-year-old racehorse trained by Bob
Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting on my nerves, that Barnett guy,'' joked Baffert,
who has a mixed history in the Texas Mile. Before losing the past
two in heartbreakers, he saddled Isitingood to defeat Skip Away in
the race's inaugural running.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett also trains Precocity, who upset Real Quiet last month
in the New Orleans Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy it every time I beat him,'' Barnett said of Baffert,
``but it's a friendly competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert knew Littlebitlively would be difficult to beat, and
said he was pleased with Real Quiet's effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran hard, he ran good,'' Baffert said. ``(Littlebitlively)
is a very good horse, an underrated horse. When I saw the pace, I
said `Uh-oh.' At least he showed some guts and kept trying to get
past that horse in the stretch. You want to win 'em all, but you
get beat.''
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent start, Littlebitlively finished second to
Behrens in the Oaklawn Handicap on April 3. Barnett said he is
considering sending him to Baltimore to join Precocity in the May 8
Pimlico Special.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet also is being pointed for the Pimlico Special,
Baffert said, so another rematch with nemesis Barnett could be in
the works.

SUNS SWEEP SEASON SERIES AS SONICS STUMBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A game official approached Sonics coach Paul Westphal
early Sunday and requested a starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal refused.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed about coaching for the first time in the building
where he was axed three years ago, Westphal recoiled his emotions.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until after the Sonics stumbled down the stretch of
Sunday's 99-93 loss to the Phoenix Suns that Westphal dropped his
shield. Unfortunately for Westphal, his Sonics were not as guarded
as long.
</P>
<P>
   In what was essentially the umpteenth must-win game this week,
the Sonics battled the Suns for 3{ quarters. But it didn't take a
genius to figure out why Westphal screamed: ``Don't foul. Just let
it end,'' with eight seconds left in the game. At that point,
winning was as hopeless as the final six minutes were for the
Sonics at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 85-84, the Sonics committed four straight turnovers
without scoring a field goal. They were beaten to loose balls and
outworked for rebounds. That stretch was enough to allow Phoenix
(21-20) to end with a 14-9 run and beat the Sonics (19-21) for the
third time this season and a first-ever sweep of their
regular-season series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't finish the game,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was the Sonics' second straight after Friday's
30-point loss at home to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to get on a roll for a month, the Sonics are floundering
toward the finish line. It is possible a playoff berth might not be
waiting at the end of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics fell 1{ games behind the Suns, who own the seventh
seed and the tie-breaker edge in the Western Conference playoff
race. The Sonics are clinging to the No. 8 spot, just one game up
on Sacramento and Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both like 20-20,'' forward Vin Baker said of Phoenix.
``I don't think it means much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' record tumbled two games below .500 for the first
time this season. The team has 10 games left.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Sonics did not earn a playoff berth was the
1989-90 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a huge game,'' Westphal said. ``If we win enough
games, we can still make the playoffs. If we make the playoffs and
heal up some of the places where we've been hurting this year, then
we can win some playoff games. But we have to find a way to put
together a run. We've been sputtering all season, but we're not
going to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal continued his course in patchwork, using yet another
starting lineup in an attempt to match the Suns' height and
offensive firepower. Only seven players saw time for the Sonics,
and it was a strange rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Baker started at center in place of Olden Polynice. The boldest
move, though, was starting Don MacLean at power forward. MacLean
had missed 33 games this season. However, he held his own against
the Suns' Tom Gugliotta, who led all scorers with 27 points and 12
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean, who had scored a total of 21 points this season, had 16
Sunday in 36 minutes. Gary Payton led the Sonics with 21 points and
11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were playing their fourth game in five days. They
finish off a grueling week tonight against the Houston Rockets at
the Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   Neither lineups nor fatigue was a major factor. Phoenix edged
the Sonics in rebounding, 41-40. Critical, though, was that the
Suns collected 20 offensive boards and beat the Sonics on the glass
14-9 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our chance,'' said forward Detlef Schrempf, who
finished with 20 points and 10 rebounds. ``We knocked the ball
loose and didn't come up with it. And we didn't get rebounds. It's
the same old story.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix had beaten the Sonics just five days earlier at
KeyArena, when Seattle collected a record NBA-low 19 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Sonics tied the game twice in the fourth before
unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got all of the big rebounds,'' Westphal said of the Suns.
``We were in control of the boards most of the game. Then, they got
the ones they needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what happened to the Sonics, Schrempf shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. Not yet. We just haven't executed,'' he said.
``That's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   And it could get worse.

HUARD'S FUTURE IN TALENTED HANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The gray skies cleared, revealing snow-capped
mountains set against a gorgeous blue horizon. It was exactly the
kind of day everyone promised Mike Holmgren happens in Seattle, the
kind of weather for which there is every reason to believe
everything is going to be all right.
</P>
<P>
   Brock Huard's NFL fate was sealed last Thursday, under nearly
blissful conditions.
</P>
<P>
   That was the day Seahawks coaches, coordinators and the
franchise's new, impressive leader decided to take a trip across
Lake Washington to the University of Washington. It was time for
the Seahawks to complete their detailed investigation of the
prototypical NFL quarterback whose stock was in the Dumpster.
</P>
<P>
   Was this lefty slinger really the shell-shocked, gun-shy,
off-balance, back-footed thrower his detractors had pegged him? Or
was this Huard a solid pro pick whose potential could be realized
with time, patience and persistence under one of the NFL's master
motivators and cultivators of quarterbacks?
</P>
<P>
   When Holmgren used a third-round pick to take Huard in this
weekend's NFL draft, the answer was obvious. All of Huard's
so-called flaws have been deemed correctable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a project, but some projects are a risk. Brock is not a
risk,'' Seahawks offensive coordinator Mike Sherman said Sunday.
``For Mike to choose him in the third round means there is a
legitimate amount of expectation that this will be successful, for
both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brock put himself in a position to come in and be competitive.
... This is a good learning experience for Brock, and when it comes
to quarterbacks, or anyone, Mike Holmgren knows what buttons to
push.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it did not hurt that the day the new Seahawks
leadership posse headed west to Montlake for Huard's last-look
workout, Seattle looked like God's country.
</P>
<P>
   And on that day, one very devout Christian young man who had
worn the weight of the world on his shoulders was helped toward an
instructive revelation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, he's a talented guy,'' Holmgren said about the
newest quarterback he will add to his heady class list that already
has included Joe Montana, Steve Young and Steve Bono in San
Francisco and Brett Favre, Ty Detmer and Mark Brunell in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He now just has (to deal with) pressure. The pressure we have
to be careful of is the pressure he will put on himself,'' Holmgren
said. ``I believe he has done that, to his detriment. I sense that
he has put that (on himself.) It's almost like he couldn't make a
mistake. Heck, it's still a game. They are not robots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Bono was a classic. He over-analyzed everything. No one
can compute that much information and act upon it. So just have a
couple things and then cut it loose. Throw it. Run. Do whatever,
but don't paralyze yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Things are starting to turn out all right for Huard, who
deserves this chance and who must feel, just like first-round
Seahawks pick Lamar King said Sunday, that coming to Seattle means
playing for one of the best coaches in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren admits that no matter how high up the food chain he
ascends, he is first and foremost still a lover of quarterbacks _
developing them by giving them the techniques, formations, reads,
confidence, instructions and green light to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren puts a premium on this particular talent of his. He
sees Huard as another gem he can help polish, as long as Huard is
willing to ingest the instruction on West Coast offense and let the
pro game come to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our workout the other day, he really had a fine workout.
But you know, one ball sailed a little bit on him, and he went (and
got really flustered and upset)'' Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Goodness gracious.' I drove over the bridge, and if
you remember that day, it was fabulous. So I'm seeing the sun on
the lake and the mountains and I'm standing there on the practice
field and I told Brock: `Hey, look around. Look at this. You're
doing fine.' But I think he wants it so bad, one of my jobs is
going to be to get him just to back off and look at it and enjoy
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first NFL draft as both head coach and team vice
president, Holmgren was determined to have fun, stockpile players
at positions where depth was lacking, make an impact on his new
team's talent pool.
</P>
<P>
   For all the hype and paralysis by over-analysis that accompanies
the NFL draft _ a non-event that somehow blusters itself to World
Wrestling Federation proportion _ Holmgren did manage to show as
much about himself.
</P>
<P>
   By picking Huard, Holmgren is giving him the opportunity to
re-invent himself right here at home.
</P>
<P>
   By picking Huard, Holmgren has all but made a commitment to
helping him prove all those critics and naysayers were too hard on
the kid.
</P>
<P>
   Huard may have been born to be a quarterback. He may have been
raised to be a quarterback. He may have dreamed of being an NFL
quarterback. But it is Holmgren who can push him to that final,
ultimate destination.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, Huard may be better off than guys named Kerry
Collins or Ryan Leaf, Tim Couch or Akili Smith.

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Christian Fittipaldi has played second
fiddle to Newman-Haas teammate Michael Andretti for too long.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight week, Fittipaldi beat his much more
heralded teammate to the finish line, taking fifth place in
Sunday's 25th annual Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. Andretti
placed seventh.
</P>
<P>
   It's Fittipaldi's best finish on the street course -- the first
time in four tries that he has been around at the finish.
</P>
<P>
   But the Brazilian, who finished third last weekend in Motegi,
Japan was still an unhappy driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disappointed,'' said Fittipaldi, who is sixth in the
points standings after the first three of 20 races. ``We're still
troubled by the set-up for street circuit and road courses. We
can't contend for the points title if this continues. We need to do
more homework. We came to this race expecting more.''
</P>
<P>
   After a promising start, including two seconds in the
Indianapolis 500, it's been a long road to get near the top for the
nephew of former CART champion Emerson Fittipaldi. Long Beach has
certainly been a road block on the way.
</P>
<P>
   He has qualified 12th or better in each of his four races along
Shoreline Drive. He was involved in crashes in 1996 and '98 and
fell two laps short of finishing in '95 because of mechanical
failure. He did not race the event in '97 because of a broken right
tibia and fibula, caused by a horrific crash at Surfer's Paradise,
Australia, that sidelined him for seven races. He has yet to win a
CART race, but has two second-place finishes and four thirds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race was good in only that I finally finished,''
Fittipaldi said. ``I'm disappointed because I could have finished
in the top three if our car had been set up better in qualifying.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Fittipaldi, who qualified 11th, gradually moved up in
the field, managing to avoid trouble ahead of him and stay near the
top with nearly flawless pit stops.
</P>
<P>
   Fittipaldi never really was in position to challenge the
leaders, even after the final re-start on Lap 81. Between him and
fourth-place Adrian Fernandez was P.J. Jones, who was running a lap
down.

of the cigarette billboard stands as a major victory, a choking-off
of an advertising medium that tobacco producers dominated for
nearly 20 years. But it also marks another change, one in this
country's visual landscape. For decades, outdoor tobacco signs were
the canvas used by some of the advertising industry's most-talented
designers and photographers. And the work they produced, ranging
from the quaint to the ingenious to the garish, have served not
only as urban meeting places and reference points for lost

SEAHAWKS FOLLOW WELL-MADE PLAN, FILL MOST NEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Add another handle to Mike Holmgren's
ever-expanding list of job titles _ the man with the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks executive vice president of football
operations/general manager and head coach waded into the first NFL
draft in which he had total control with an aggressive agenda
Saturday morning and emerged Sunday afternoon with a smile and
seven almost handpicked players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, Mike was in control,'' defensive coordinator
Fritz Shurmur said. ``He had a plan. He exhibited his ability to be
able to take his resources and use them and come up with the best
conclusions for the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Holmgren had turned five draft picks into
seven players and filled all but one of the team's needs entering
the two-day event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun. It was exciting,'' said Holmgren, who was hired in
January to control the Seahawks' football operation after seven
seasons as coach of the Green Bay Packers. ``If you look at the
players we did get in the draft, you see that we addressed some
needs as well as got some real fine players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming out it,'' he added, ``I am very, very pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-day efforts of Holmgren and his draft team might not
yield an opening-day starter but did stock an already solid roster
with more depth, talent and versatility _ defensive end Lamar King,
quarterback Brock Huard and wide receiver Karsten Bailey in
Saturday's first three rounds; defensive end Antonio Cochran,
tackle Floyd Wedderburn, kick returner Charlie Rogers and
cornerback Steve Johnson in Sunday's final four rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren added three picks by trading down twice in the first
round and still got the player he would have selected at No. 17 _
King, a 297-pounder who could challenge for a starting job and at
the very least be used in a rotation at defensive end or/and
tackle.
</P>
<P>
   The extra picks the Seahawks got from the New England Patriots
and Dallas Cowboys for moving down five spots in the first round
where used to grab Bailey in the third round and to trade up in the
sixth round to select Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren was not alone in the ``war room'' and shared credit for
all this wheeling, dealing and stealing with vice president of
football operations Randy Mueller, director of player personnel
John Dorsey, his assistant coaches and the team's scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about the whole process and how we came out of the
draft,'' Holmgren said. ``It was a real team effort.''
</P>
<P>
   But the point man was Holmgren, who cut his drafting teeth under
Bill Walsh as an assistant coach with the San Francisco 49ers and
honed those skills while working with Packers general manager Ron
Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there were any doubts Holmgren could pull off a
successful draft in his first attempt, Shurmer offered, ``Of course
not. No. One of the things that everybody recognizes is that he has
had a great command of offensive football and what it takes to
coach the football team. But there was never any doubt in our minds
about his ability to judge and select talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren showed he also is a team player by going for a
defensive player in the first round when there were tempting
alternatives on the offensive side.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an indication of the fact that he is the head coach of
the whole football team and has an interest in all of it,'' said
Shurmur, unable to hold back a smile.
</P>
<P>
   An indication that Holmgren also is a bit of perfectionist came
in the amount of time he spent dwelling on the one player that got
away _ a pass-catching tight end. He had hoped to draft either
North Alabama's Bobby Collins, who went to Buffalo in the fourth
round, or Michigan's Jerame Truman, who was taken by Pittsburgh in
the fifth round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like body punches when they were taken,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren didn't recoil, however, he struck back, using a
fifth-round pick to fill a need by taking the best punt returner in
the draft, Rogers, and giving up two picks in the sixth round to
make sure he got the cornerback he wanted, Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   No tight ends, but players who should help that Seahawks end the
league's longest playoff drought at 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than that,'' Holmgren said of not getting a tight end,
``it kind of fell together.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as planned.

ABDUL CASTS A SPELL AS ONE SHARP KID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're interviewing the state's best speller, you might as
well ask him to tackle some tough words.
</P>
<P>
   Some might think the request a bit rude, putting him on the spot
like that. But to his credit, Abdul Kahsai showed none of the
reluctance of a doctor at a cocktail party who balks at listening
to someone drone on about an ingrown toenail. The 12-year-old
seventh-grader at Taylor Junior High School in Mesa jumped right in
and clicked off ``pestiferous'' (CQ) and ``diagenesis'' (CQ)
without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, since he won the state spelling bee April 10, this was
nothing that all his classmates haven't been asking of him every
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just ask Abdul,'' Andy Flambouras, one of Abdul's teachers,
said. ``He's our built-in dictionary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my job,'' Abdul said with justifiable pride and a grin.
``I'm the state spelling-bee champion.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a good sport, Abdul. Monstrously hard-working and
competitive as all get-out, but a good sport nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say he's perfect. He faltered a bit on
``chrysanthemum'' and ``meprobamate'' (CQ) in our impromptu session
(blame the dubious pronunciations of his inquisitor). But if his
work habits hold true, he won't misspell them again.
</P>
<P>
   TOUGH DAD, SADISTIC JOE
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Abdul lost at the district level. Missed
``etiquette.'' Still pains him, you can tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so disappointed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So much so that he has studied lists of words every day since
the middle of December. Not just looked them over, studied them,
all 150 words per page.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was to miss just one word, my dad would make me go back
and study the whole page'' again, Abdul said last week in
Flambouras' classroom. ``The second (miss), he made me look up the
definitions. The third time, he made me write a sentence with (the
word) in it.''
</P>
<P>
   There weren't many third times. Or, for that matter, seconds.
Just ask Joe Halcomb. The 13-year-old Joe, Abdul's self-described
spelling coach, tagged along with Abdul for an interview and
revealed his methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I helped him by reading the words, and he spelled them out,''
Joe explained. Sounds simple. Deceptively so. Joe also had a
punishment worked out: Every time Abdul missed a word, he owed Joe
10 push-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ONLY ONE PROBLEM
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't missed any yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Joe's career as a sadistic and demanding coach is getting
off to a slow start. On the bright side, all the work is helping
Joe, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm starting to get used to all these big words,'' he
said. &QL; 
ABDUL GOES TO WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his study habits, Abdul buzzed through ``nyctalopia,''
``lobscouse''and ``prosateur'' (CQ) in the state bee.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's getting ready for the national bee in Washington, D.C.,
in June. He and Joe will continue their work. Meanwhile, Abdul
answered the question I've always had about good spellers: Does he
see the word in his mind and just spell what he sees? Or does he go
by spelling rules?
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to sound it out phonetically,'' he said. ``Then it comes
out into my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   As you can see, Abdul is adept at answering dumb questions. He
should be. He's been on television and been interviewed by
newspapers. He's even had a scheduled appearance on a local morning
show rescheduled at the last minute _ by now, he's an old pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``People I never knew before come up to me and say, `Hey, you're
the spelling-bee man,' '' Abdul said. Does that include girls?
</P>
<P>
   Huge blush.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's getting a little bit too personal there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. But his embarrassment pointed out what a normal, cool _
if extremely smart _ kid Abdul is. He likes basketball, swimming,
rap, hip-hop, video games _ all the things 12-year-olds do.
</P>
<P>
   Since there is no market for professional spellers, Abdul
already has started thinking about career plans. He wants to be a
basketball player. And if that doesn't work out?
</P>
<P>
   ``A journalist.''
</P>
<P>
   Told you he was smart. &QL;

   Elie sinks game-winner, Rockets' spirits

   Spurs erase 23-point deficit to slam division rivals

SAN ANTONIO _ Mario Elie blew a bitter kiss and pounded his chest,
screaming at the Rockets' bench with everything he had to be heard
over the Alamodome roar. He lifted his jersey to expose his heart,
as if sure it beat hard enough to show through the skin.
</P>
<P>
   He need not have bothered. The heart of a castoff is clearly
still beating.
</P>
<P>
   Elie more than beat the Rockets on Sunday, nailing a no-doubt 3
with one-tenth of a second left for an 86-83 Spurs win. He punished
the Rockets for letting him go and the insult he carried with him
to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   He scored the Spurs' last 10 points, and still stinging from
Charles Barkley's comments last week that Elie was concerned last
season only with a new contract, he angrily exacted his revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just heart,'' Elie said before Spurs officials pulled him
to the locker room, against his wishes, when he was asked about his
feelings about the Rockets. ``I was showing them my heart. It takes
heart to take a shot like that. It will be good to talk trash this
summer knowing we got them 3-0 in the regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had little to say about Elie's vendetta. But they
knew him well enough to know how he felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure,'' Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon said, ``this made
his whole season.''
</P>
<P>
   For them, the Rockets said it was as crushing a defeat as they
have felt all season, surpassing even the 15-point fourth-quarter
collapse in Utah. This time, they blew a 23-point lead in the first
half but recovered and led by three with two minutes left, and by
two with 52 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   And since rededicating themselves Monday in Minnesota, they had
more at stake in San Antonio than even Sunday's chance to move into
a tie with the Spurs for the third seed in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since ,'' Barkley said, unable or
unwilling to capture his emotions. ``I feel disappointed right now.
I'm just disappointed, because we played well. To end on this note
is disappointing. We really wanted this game. I can't even express
how I feel. I feel sad. We really wanted to win this game.''
</P>
<P>
   That was clear from the outset when the notoriously
slow-starting Rockets rushed to a 31-13 lead after the first
quarter. They blew all of that by the time two minutes were gone in
the second half. But they also recovered from the Spurs' comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon struggled most of the night, making eight of 26 shots.
Scottie Pippen, after his 31-point outburst Thursday, took five
shots, finishing with six points.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Rockets down 70-66 with 10 minutes left, Olajuwon
scored eight of his 18 points in a span of six minutes, his hook in
the lane tying the game at 78 with 3:16 left. When Bryce Drew
pulled up on a fast break for a 3, the Rockets led by three with
2:42 left.
</P>
<P>
   But that only seemed to cue Elie, in such situations so many
times, to take over. He had scored the Spurs' previous points on a
fast-break dunk after Pippen slipped and lost the ball. With 1:42
left, he answered Drew's 3 with one of his own, drifting uncovered
to the corner to take a pass from Avery Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a couple of mistakes letting them get that 3-pointer
with a three-point lead,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
``We left a guy in the corner on a pick-and-roll. We never do that.
We definitely never do that with a 3-point lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley (23 points) regained the Rockets' lead, making two free
throws with 52 seconds left. But on an inbounds play under the
basket, Elie set a pick for David Robinson, then slipped to the
basket for a layup, tying the score with 44.1 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs left the Rockets enough time for two possessions. The
Rockets found Pippen wide-open in the corner for a 3 that touched
every part of the rim and possibly some of the net before popping
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just came out,'' Pippen said. ``I had a good look at the
shot. I didn't want to throw up any to get a two-for-one. At that
stage, we needed to come down and make a defensive stop. We didn't.
We allowed a guy to set up at the 3.''
</P>
<P>
   They allowed the wrong guy. With his 7-of-8 shooting game, Elie
has shot 77.3 percent against the Rockets this season and has made
nine of 10 3s. He was covered for all but the last split second.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson used a Robinson pick to head down the lane, drawing
Olajuwon off Robinson. Johnson's pass to Robinson pulled Drew off
Elie. And Elie set up his game-winner as coolly as if playing in
the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Robinson at 17 feet wide-open,'' Drew said. ``My
reaction was with five seconds left to run over there. I was sure
he'd shoot it. When he passed, I knew my man was wide-open. My
heart stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   But Elie's heart beat hard enough for both, until he all but
pulled it from his chest to show off to the team he believed had
left it broken. By the time his celebration began, the Rockets knew
the feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we feel now,'' Barkley said, ``I don't want to ever
feel again.''

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Astros manager Larry Dierker couldn't help but wonder lately if his
team would ever come from behind with one of those late big innings
that became a trademark last season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Finally,'' Dierker said Sunday after the Astros rallied with a
six-run eighth to defeat the St. Louis Cardinals 8-4 at the
Astrodome. ``I kept looking at the scoreboard, day after day, and
all of these teams were scoring four, five and six runs in an
inning against us. For a team that's supposed to do it a little
more often, we hadn't done it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   After producing 48 come-from-behind victories _ 27 in their
final at-bat _ last season, the Astros entered Sunday's eighth
inning an uncharacteristic 0-6 when trailing after seven. They had
not scored more than three runs in an inning all season.
</P>
<P>
   Releasing two weeks' worth of frustration, the Astros sent 11
batters to the plate during the decisive inning that turned a
two-run deficit into a four-run cushion. Carl Everett began the
rally with a solo home run and later in the inning had an RBI
single as the Astros escaped Mark McGwire's fifth home run of the
season and salvaged one victory in the three-game series against
their National League Central rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a turning point for us to get those runners in,''
said Everett, who was 3-for-4 and has hit safely in 11 of 12 games
this season. ``Everybody chipped in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' eight runs and 16 hits off four St. Louis pitchers
were season highs. But they waited until they were down to six outs
to get things going. Cardinals relievers Lance Painter (0-1) and
Scott Radinsky were victimized for most of the damage, each
allowing three runs in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were going to have another 13-hit, three-run
outburst,'' first baseman Jeff Bagwell said. ``We were kind of
disappointed the last few days. We had been outhitting the
Cardinals every time, and they end up beating us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros outhit the Cardinals in the previous two games of the
series only to lose 5-3 and 8-5. The Cards used a five-run fourth
inning Friday and a seven-run eighth on Saturday to seal the
Astros' fate.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different story Sunday. Everett connected on the first
pitch from Painter in the eighth for his second home run of the
season, and the Astros tied the game at 4 when Alex Diaz doubled
and scored on a single by Tony Eusebio.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell, who was 4-for-4 with three RBIs, drove in the
go-ahead run with a bases-loaded sacrifice fly to center field.
Bagwell chipped in a two-run single off Radinsky, and Everett
followed with his second hit of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of expectations are on this offense, and rightfully
so,'' Bagwell said. ``It seemed like we scored eight runs a lot
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Astros scored eight or more runs 35 times last
season. Before Sunday, however, they had been held to half that or
worse in seven of 11 games this season, five of those losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros took a 1-0 lead early on when Craig Biggio and Bell
doubled to start the bottom of the first. St. Louis tied the game
in the second when Astros starter Mike Hampton allowed four
straight hits, including a run-scoring double by Shawon Dunston.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who received a no-decision, got some much-needed help
from his defense to get out of the inning with only one run
allowed. Diaz, a replacement for Richard Hidalgo in left field,
took Dunston's double off the wall and relayed the ball to
shortstop Tim Bogar, who threw out Fernando Tatis at the plate
after Eric Davis had scored. J.D. Drew then singled up the middle,
but Everett gunned down Dunston at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton allowed four runs and eight hits in seven innings,
walking four and striking out five.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who entered the series finale with one hit in his
previous nine at-bats, gave the Cardinals a 2-1 lead with a solo
home run to left off Hampton in the fourth. With five homers in 11
games, McGwire is ahead of the pace he set en route to a record 70
last year. He didn't hit No. 5 until the Cardinals' 13th game in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pitched me pretty darn good,'' said McGwire, who went
2-for-12 in the series. ``The only pitch I really saw was the one I
got the home run on.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Astros pulled even at 2, St. Louis went back in front
4-2 in the seventh on Placido Polanco's two-run single off Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Powell (1-0), who gave up four runs in a third of an inning
a night earlier, pitched a scoreless eighth inning with two
strikeouts to pick up the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get thrown from the horse, the first thing you have
to do is get back on it,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wagner finished, striking out two of the four hitters he
faced in the ninth. In five innings this season, Wagner has eight
strikeouts.

MONTOYA RIGHT ON TARGET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Someone needs to stop Chip Ganassi before
he gets on a plane headed home to Indianapolis and ask the
Target/Ganassi Racing owner if he could please give the Long Beach
streets back to the city. There are hard-working, tax-paying
citizens who need them to get to work this morning.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Ganassi doesn't need the streets anymore, at least
not until next April. His 1999 work schedule at the Beach ended
Sunday at about 3 p.m. in what has become Team Target's home away
from home _ the winner's circle of the Grand Prix of Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who saw Jimmy Vasser win in 1996 and Alex Zanardi speed
his way to back-to-back victories the past two seasons can't be
surprised about Target's fourth consecutive triumph on the streets
of Long Beach. Until you consider the latest Long Beach winner,
Juan Montoya, is a 23-year-old rookie who until Sunday had a CART
FedEx Championship resume of two races and came from a European
Formula 3000 series that rarely runs on temporary street courses.
</P>
<P>
   The only team to dominate Long Beach in similar fashion was
Galles-Kraco, which won five consecutive races with Al Unser Jr.
(1988-91) and Danny Sullivan (1992).
</P>
<P>
   So what allowed Team Target to coax Montoya to victory, even
though the Long Beach course was different than the previous three
years?
</P>
<P>
   ``California water,'' Ganassi said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Herta, who traded champagne sprays with Montoya and
runner-up Dario Franchitti, had a different answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's something they do here in particular,''
said Herta, a Valencia native who drives the No.8 Shell car for
Team Rahal. ``They do a good job everywhere. They have a lot of
money, they have a great package, they have a lot of good people,
they have great drivers and they execute races. I mean, they are
the benchmark now and they continue to be the one we are trying to
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The only one who appeared quick enough to beat Montoya on Sunday
was pole sitter Tony Kanaan, and his day ended on the 45th lap when
he slid his McDonald's Drive Thru car into the tire barrier at the
inside of turn 6. Montoya, who shadowed Kanaan for several laps,
directed his red-yellow-and-white No.4 Reynard-Honda into the lead
and dominated the remainder of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya's lead grew as large as 11.175 seconds over Franchitti
before a yellow flag on the 78th of 85 laps came out when Cristiano
da Matta hit the same tire barriers that claimed Kanaan. But
Montoya was too good, holding off Franchitti by 2.805 seconds to
take his first checkered flag. He averaged 87.915 miles per hour on
the 11-turn, 1.824-mile street circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the top five consisted of Herta, Patrick
Racing's Adrian Fernandez and Newman-Haas driver Christian
Fittipaldi.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya's victory in only his third Champ Car race marks the
second-quickest win for a rookie driver in an open-wheel series.
Nigel Mansell set the standard in Australia when he won his first
CART event, but that came after he established himself as a Formula
One champion before coming to the United States. Zanardi was second
on the list after winning in his ninth start of his 1996 rookie
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is my best win,'' said Montoya, who was the
European 3000 champion and four-time race winner last season.
``This weekend, we put it all together. Now we're just going to try
to keep on winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya sang a different tune after a 10th-place effort in the
season- pener in Miami and a frustrating weekend in Japan. Montoya
was fined $5,000 and put on probation by CART officials after a
Japan qualifying incident with Michael Andretti, and the Colombian
rookie saw a promising race end the next day when he ran out of
fuel while trying to get past eventual winner Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, in Homestead, I don't think we gave him a good
car,'' Ganassi said. ``We had some mechanical failure. We had some
mechanical/mental failure from the team in (Japan). I think we let
him down in the first couple of races.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a difficult final qualifying run, the same can't be
said for this weekend. Montoya was second in the first qualifying
session and had a perfect car during the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for us to get back to our
no-mechanical-failure ways,'' said Ganassi, whose team is trying to
become the first to win four consecutive points titles. ``I think,
obviously, we have high expectations as a team. I'd like to think
we have a pretty good group of guys that are engineering the car
and screwing it together.''
</P>
<P>
   In Montoya, they also have a pretty good guy joining Vasser _
who finished a disappointing 10th on Sunday _ on Team Target.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever was going to steer (Zanardi's former car) as we all
know had big shoes to fill,'' said Ganassi of his two-time CART
champion driver, who electrified the series with his charisma on
and off the track. ``All of these guys are fast at this level; to
win you have to have someone mentally tough. I knew (Montoya) had
the talent. What I didn't know was if he had the mental toughness
to put those (early season) incidents behind him. You don't see
that much from a guy his age.''
</P>
<P>
   Another youngster, Kanaan, was sitting on the pole for the first
time as a CART driver. He lost that lead quickly when Herta,
starting on the inside of the second row, turned up the power as
the green flag dropped and beat the front row of Kanaan and
Franchitti to the first turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about that start for Bryan?'' said Team Rahal owner and
former CART champion Bobby Rahal. ``That was a great move.''
</P>
<P>
   Herta's only lead of the day lasted one lap before Kanaan dipped
under the Shell car for the lead at the end of the back
straightaway. For the next 44 laps it was Kanaan on the lead, but
that ended when he got caught in the marbles on Turn 6 and crashed
into the tire barriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake,'' Kanaan said. ``The track was breaking up
and I just ran off line a little bit and lost it. Sometimes you
learn the hard way.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya happily accepted the lead, but he also showed a touch of
compassion for his competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too bad what happened to Tony,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Montoya, who was trailing by a scant 0.783 seconds at the
time, had a plan against Kanaan even if the No.44 car didn't find
the tire barrier. That plan?
</P>
<P>
   ``Overtake him,'' Montoya said.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya, who qualified fifth, had overtaken Herta on the 22nd
lap and got past Franchitti on the restart following a 27th lap
collision that knocked Tarso Marques out of the race and Scott
Pruett and Helio Castro-Neves down a lap. Once Kanaan exited, it
was Franchitti trying to catch Montoya, but with each lap it became
evident that the Team Kool Green driver would have to settle for
second place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave it everything I had today, but we just didn't have the
car to challenge for the win,'' said Franchitti. ``That's unusual
because we normally have the best car on the street circuits. We
were lacking a little bit, but the guys from Team Kool Green gave
me great stops and kept me in the hunt all day. On the track,
however, we just weren't fast enough today.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchitti, who is the circuit's best street-course operator,
had enough to claim a fourth consecutive top-two finish on a
temporary street course.

PIECE OF JEROME, ARIZ., HISTORY FOR SALE _ GHOSTS AND ALL

   JEROME, Ariz. _ Like a fortress atop Cleopatra Hill, this relic
mining-company hospital sat empty for 45 years before it was
brought back to life in 1996 as the Jerome Grand Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But the hotel's owners pulled the plug in January and the 1926
landmark is back on life support, awaiting an April 30 auction that
could lure a new owner and another revival.
</P>
<P>
   Potential buyers will have to consider the viability of the
hotel, which was in business just 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Although hundreds of tourists visit Jerome's historic hillside
galleries, cafes and taverns each day, most of them are gone by
sundown, winding their way down the ``Hogback'' on the highway to
Clarkdale.
</P>
<P>
   The five-story hotel is perched above the main business
district, nearly a mile above sea level and accessible only by
steep and narrow Hill Street.
</P>
<P>
   Occupancy at the Jerome Grand averaged about 50 percent, and the
restaurant and lounge drew people from all over the Verde Valley
and Sedona. Rates for the hotel's 20 rooms ranged from $70 to $170
per night.
</P>
<P>
   The Altherr family, which bought the presumably haunted property
in 1994, was much better at converting it into a hotel than it was
at running a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was burning us out managing it,'' Larry Altherr said.
</P>
<P>
   Auctioneer John Weaver of Southwest Real Estate Auctioneers said
bidding for the one-of-a-kind property probably will start around
$2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Altherr said Phelps Dodge was asking $670,000 for the property
in 1994, and his family invested about $1 million in improvements.
</P>
<P>
   When they took over the place, Altherr and his brother, Bob,
tinkered like mad scientists with the electrical control panel to
restart the 70-year-old Otis elevator, which has an accordion door.
They also fired up the original Kewannee steam boiler and switched
the lights on for the first time in 44 years.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a sight when the hospital on the hill beamed with
light, Larry Altherr said.
</P>
<P>
   A tour reveals that the hospital-turned-hotel has survived the
ravages of time with remarkable grace, save for some leaky windows
and drainpipes. Two-thirds of the 32 rooms have been restored.
</P>
<P>
   The Altherrs, Phoenix natives with a background in construction
and restoration, maintained the architectural integrity of the
Spanish mission-style building while transforming it from its
institutional roots into an interesting historic inn.
</P>
<P>
   Some townsfolk say there was friction between the town and the
Altherrs, particularly over some excavation on the property.
</P>
<P>
   But Mayor Jay Kinsella said the hotel was an asset to Jerome and
he'd like to see another owner have a go at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's all lit up at night, it's absolutely beautiful,''
Kinsella said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Verde Mining Co. hospital was built during Jerome's
lucrative mining era, when the population soared to 15,000. The
30,000-square-foot hospital was a modern marvel, with one of the
state's first self-service elevators. Phelps Dodge bought United
Verde in 1935 and operated the hospital until 1950, three years
before the company shut the mines. Phelps Dodge maintained the
hospital in working order until 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome, 110 miles north of Phoenix on the steep slope of Mingus
Mountain, dwindled to a ghost of its billion-dollar boomtown past,
when miners blew their pay in casinos, bars and bawdy houses.
</P>
<P>
   The population dwindled to a few hundred before a renaissance
began in the 1960s. Jerome, celebrating its centennial this year,
now has about 475 residents.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's haunted reputation mushroomed from its long
dormancy and tales of mysterious deaths and ghosts. Jerome, after
all, is a ghost town.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their initiation, fraternity pledges from Northern
Arizona University sometimes were forced to sneak into the old
hospital and spend the night, Kinsella says.
</P>
<P>
   A science-fiction cable television program called ``Insights''
brought up a crew and a clairvoyant to explore the hospital's
mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Among the deaths at the United Verde Hospital was a terminally
ill mining company superintendent who shot himself, a caretaker who
hanged himself and a hospital maintenance man, Claude Harvey, who
was found dead at the bottom of the elevator shaft in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   An inquest was inconclusive, but Altherr said he believes that
Harvey simply had a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   He has seen some mysterious things _ doors swinging open
inexplicably and the old call lights for the nurses going on when
nobody was around to activate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a deal with the ghost,'' Altherr said, half-seriously.
``I said, `You don't pay rent and you don't hold a paintbrush;
don't bother me and I won't bother you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Not all memories of the United Verde Hospital are so dark.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Schrader was born there in 1929. Her father, John Oscar
Mullen, was school superintendent in Jerome for 40 years and she
lived in the town until 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the hospital a couple of times,'' she recalled. ``At
about age 6, they thought I had appendicitis, but it turned out I
probably just ate too many peanut butter cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, she hit an iron pole in a sledding accident
and woke up in the hospital. Her left side was paralyzed for about
six months.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader, now a Tucson real estate broker, has fond memories of
Jerome, recalling all the recreational facilities and services
provided by the mining company.
</P>
<P>
   She returned in 1997 for her 50th high school reunion and stayed
at the Jerome Grand Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The room was lovely,'' Schrader said. ``The building was
really sad before these people took it over. They have done wonders
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   James Byrkit, a retired NAU professor and author, also began
life in the United Verde Hospital, at dawn on June 16, 1931.
</P>
<P>
   The building holds some vivid memories for him, although he has
not seen the Jerome Grand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember having my tonsils out at age 10 and I was scared to
death when they were putting me under with the ether,'' Byrkit
said. ``They told me it wouldn't hurt. I was in horrible pain when
I woke up, so I thought they had lied to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrkit, a historian who wrote ``Forging the Copper Collar,'' an
unflattering look at the power wielded by mining companies in early
Arizona, recalls ambulances racing up the hill to the hospital
after a miner accidentally set off a dynamite charge or the mine
shaft hoists gave way.
</P>
<P>
   The surgical suite where the injured miners were treated by
longtime Jerome surgeon A.C. Carlson remains intact in the Jerome
Grand. Lighted by a skylight and a bank of windows looking down on
the town, the pale-blue tiled operating room originally was
targeted for a new life as a large hotel suite, Altherr said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's dispensary has been transformed into the Grand
View Lounge, which includes a player-piano nickelodeon that
nowadays costs a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Solariums at the end of the hospital wings have been kept as
sitting rooms for guests. A room that old blueprints call the
``Violet Ray Room'' now is a guest room.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital, now on the National Register of Historic Places,
was designed by Lescher &AMP; Mahoney, a prominent Phoenix
architectural firm.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth hospital built in Jerome. Underground
cave-ins, a common scourge of the town's buildings, weakened the
foundation of previous hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, the auctioneer, said the hotel is a hard property to
market, but the right buyer could step in and capitalize on the
Altherrs' efforts.
</P>
<P>
   He called it a chance for someone to own a piece of Arizona
history, ghosts and all. &QL;

FOR GRETZKY, A GREAT FAREWELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Only a once-in-a-millennium star could outgrow a
nickname like ``The Great One.''
</P>
<P>
   Hockey will spawn more great players. But Sunday at Madison
Square Garden, it bid bittersweet farewell to retiring Wayne
Gretzky _ ``The Greatest One.''
</P>
<P>
   After 20 seasons of hogging every award, inventing new ways to
put the puck in the net and spreading the gospel of hockey from
frigid Ontario to sunny Miami, Gretzky dished out one last,
glorious assist and called it a career after the New York Rangers'
2-1 overtime loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins before 18,200 raucous
spectators who came for one last glimpse of the most successful
person to wear skates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to kill me not to play, but mentally and physically
I'm really ready to retire,'' said Gretzky, who faked a slap shot
that knocked goalie Tom
</P>
<P>
   Barrasso off his feet before sliding a gorgeous assist to Brian
Leetch for a 1-1 tie and his last NHL point late in the second
period. ``I don't want to take this sweater off, because I know
I'll never put it on again.''
</P>
<P>
   After making the NHL his personal Wayne's World, the league's
human power play was ushered out with a ceremony that felt more
like a royal abdication. With 99 bottles of tears on the walls of
the Garden and an adoring national television audience watching,
Gretzky endured an emotional day in which he received telephone
calls from President Clinton and Michael Jordan, then was showered
with a rink full of going-away presents including Bryan Adams
slipping in an impromptu ``We will miss you Wayne'' into O, Canada!
(''I don't think those words will stick,'' Gretzky said), a
limited-edition baseball glove chair (like the one in Yankees owner
George Steinbrenner's office), numerous standing ovations, a
75-inch TV, a new black Mercedes-Benz (''Of course I'm keeping it,
I earned it,'' he said, joking) and _ best of all _ surprise visits
from stars such as Mark O'Meara, Christopher Reeve, Mark Messier
and Mario Lemieux.
</P>
<P>
   Coach John Muckler ``called a timeout with 30 seconds left and
told me I had to get the game-winner,'' said Gretzky, who used 40
sticks and wore three sweaters during the game. ``When I was
younger I might have gotten it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalpers asked $1,000 for ice-level seats for the finale,
highlighted by the most famous 99 this side of Nena's 99 Luft
Balloons and Tony Dorsett's record run getting the most
recognizable uniform number in sports history retired. Everywhere.
Forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the ultimate honor,'' said Gretzky, who came out of the
postgame locker room for two tear-filled encores in which players
slammed sticks on the ice and fans covered the surface with hats
and bouquets of flowers to Tina Turner's Simply the Best.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing the NHL is headed toward longer, colder winters
without Gretzky's ballet- dancer magic in a mosh pit full of
billy-club toting rogues, everyone from Hall of Fame legend Gordie
Howe to Gretzky's wife, Janet, and even Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien tried to talk him out of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so talented he could get by on one skate,'' Howe said.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky can still sneak a puck through the five hole during rush
hour at Grand Central Station and still do for hockey what Elvis
did for rock 'n' roll, but the 38-year-old said he's retiring based
on an undeniable ``gut feeling.'' With the rebuilding Rangers
(33-38-11) years from another Stanley Cup run and his production
noticeably slipping (9 goals this season compared with 92 in
'81-82), Gretzky is allowing himself to feel downright human. Three
months after Jordan quit basketball and maybe months before John
Elway walks away from football, he is tossing the keys to younger,
faster stars such as Paul Kariya, Mike Modano, Eric Lindros and
Jaromir Jagr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go out like Michael, but it's not a perfect
world,'' he said. ``They talk about passing torches, and maybe
today it was fitting that Jaromir scored that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   But losing his finale hardly put a damper on the career of a
player who long ago became hockey's been-there, done-that poster
boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He single-handedly changed our sport,'' said Lemieux, who wore
No. 66 because it was Gretzky's 99 upside down. ``I mean, what else
is there for him to do? If anyone accomplishes half of what he did,
it'll be a great career.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are unfathomable: 4 Stanley Cups, 10 scoring titles,
9 MVP awards, 61 records, 894 goals, 1,963 assists and 2,857 points
in 1,487 games.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Gretzky has more assists than any player has
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to even comprehend,'' Detroit Red Wings coach
Scotty Bowman said. ``It's like he hit .400 with 70 homers every
year for 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   As impressive and unreachable as Gretzky's numbers are, they
only tell a face-off's portion of the story about a star who played
a different style of game and who _ like Jordan, Muhammad Ali and
Babe Ruth _ transcended his sport.
</P>
<P>
   Even with his Ichabod Crane physique (6-foot, 175 pounds),
average skating speed and ho-hum slap-shot velocity, Gretzky became
the game's most feared offensive player with supreme intuition.
More Larry Bird than Jordan, more Tony Gwynn than Mark McGwire and
more Barry Sanders than Jim Brown, Gretzky injected finesse and
grace into a macho sport ruled by blood and fists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so much more intelligent,'' said his former Edmonton
Oilers coach, Glen Sather. ``While they were using all this energy
trying to rattle his teeth, he was just skating away, circling,
analyzing things.'' Cosell behind the microphone and Roger Staubach
simply behind, ]
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky was most comfortable and dangerous behind the net, which
was often called his ``office.'' He perched there and dangled the
puck as if by a string, his twinkling blue eyes seemingly seeing
the kaleidoscope of swirling patterns in slow motion.
</P>
<P>
   He often made passes off the boards, once pulled off a
give-and-go to himself off the side of the net, and scored the
winning goal in Game 7 of the '93 Western Conference Finals by
purposely flicking the puck off the skate of Toronto defenseman
Dave Ellett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years after he's retired he'll still be the best passer
in the game,'' former goalie and Rangers broadcaster John Davidson
said. ``Nobody on this planet is even close.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky always had (super)natural talent, from the time he took
No. 99 in honor of his idol Howe (No. 9) and proceeded to earn the
``Great One'' moniker from a reporter who watched him score 378
points in 82 games as a 10-year-old for the Soo Greyhounds in
Brantford, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   But it's off the ice where Gretzky has grown larger than legend,
promoting hockey more than even Jordan helped basketball. Like the
entrance of Bird and Magic Johnson for the NBA or Alan Ameche's
overtime touchdown plunge for the NFL, Gretzky's move to Los
Angeles is considered the NHL's launching pad.
</P>
<P>
   ``He carried hockey not only by playing it the best but by also
selling it the best,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said, noting that
the optimism Gretzky generated sprouted franchises in warm-weather
cities such as San Jose, Phoenix and Dallas. ``Think of all the
jobs he created and people's lives he's touched just by being Wayne
Gretzky.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gretzky, shrugging: ``I'm not bigger than the game of
hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   There are countless sports fans, however _ those who can't
recite one rule but nod at the mention of Gretzky's name _ who
disagree. nn

FREE-AGENT SIGNEES, DRAFT MAKE FOR HAPPY COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Teams around the league are looking back today
and surveying what they accomplished in the 1999 NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys' retrospective, however, entails more than
just the two-day draft.
</P>
<P>
   The restocking of their franchise began in earnest earlier last
week with the signing of free-agent center Mark Stepnoski and
receiver Raghib Ismail and continued with the signing of linebacker
Quentin Coryatt on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   To the Cowboys, those additions were more important in getting
ready for the 1999 season than what they did in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   However, when adding the seven draft picks, led by top pick
Ebenezer Ekuban, a pass-rushing defensive end, the Cowboys believe
they've improved their team as much, if not more, than any team in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   And their satisfaction comes despite the uncertainty surrounding
All-Pro defensive tackle Leon Lett, who according to a source, has
violated the league's substance-abuse policy and faces an
indefinite ban from the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``No team in the NFL did what we did in the last week,'' Cowboys
coach Chan Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said there is no doubt in his mind
that the Cowboys are a better team than the one that ended the 1998
campaign with a playoff loss to the Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   And he said it's a result of the free-agent moves and the draft
combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about personnel,'' Jones said. ``You have to improve
through free agency. That's how you get to the Super Bowl. You
don't get to the Super Bowl with just good drafts. I am not
satisfied. But I am pretty pleased with how far we have come. We
will have better personnel going into training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys believe they had a good draft, which they credit to
the free-agent moves. Jones said the additions of Stepnoski, Ismail
and Coryatt filled their most pressing needs for starters at
center, wide receiver and linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   It allowed them to stick with their philosophy of picking the
best athletes available in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   After taking West Virginia offensive tackle Solomon Page and
Texas A&AMP;M linebacker Dat Nguyen in the second and third rounds
Saturday, they made five more picks Sunday. Receiver Wane McGarity
of Texas and defensive end Peppi Zellner were taken in the fourth
round.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Martay Jenkins of Nebraska-Omaha was picked in the
sixth round and tight end Mike Lucky of Arizona and guard Kelvin
Garmon of Baylor and Haltom High School were taken in the seventh
round.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey was also pleased that, while they stuck to their
best-athlete philosophy, they were able to fill needs at several
key positions _ linebacker, defensive end and wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also wanted a defensive tackle, but refused to reach
for one who was not rated high when it was their turn to pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stuck to the board, but when it was even, we took the
position where we had a need,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   While Garmon, who is still recovering from a broken leg, is
questionable for training camp, the Cowboys believe the rest of the
their picks have a chance to contribute next season. Ekuban will
play immediately. Nguyen and McGarity have the potential to make
immediate impacts, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason the Cowboys believe they are better is because
they will be faster, as speed was the recurring theme with their
moves in the draft and free agency.
</P>
<P>
   The first six picks are considered to be exceptionally fast for
their position, especially Zellner, who ran a 4.5, the fastest time
in the 40-yard dash of any defensive end at the NFL combine. And
Ismail's speed is without question.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, however, said the main thing he likes is that they are
great football players, first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to get faster every year,'' Gailey said. ``At
the same time, we want great football players. We want football
players that can run. We believe that's what we got.'' nn

MORGAN'S STRONG START IS A BIG LIFT FOR RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Mike Morgan, ex-employee of 10 major-league
teams, is discovering a simple truth about life with the Texas
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Give it time, just a little bit of time, and the Rangers'
offense will usually deliver substantial run support. Perhaps not
every time. Perhaps not against Roger Clemens or David Wells, and
there might be a day when they get shut down by some journeyman
slop artist.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the time, Juan Gonzalez &AMP; Co. somehow find a way to
score runs. All they ask is for their pitcher to hold off the
opposition for a few innings. They're not asking for a no-hitter,
just a couple of measly innings so they have time to pummel the
typical hapless, faceless American League pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   When Morgan did that yesterday, the Rangers responded with some
early offense of their own and went on to defeat the Oakland
Athletics, 6-2, at Network Associates Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morgan threw great,'' Gonzalez said. ``When a guy pitches like
that, it makes all of us more comfortable. When you're down five or
six runs early, it puts more pressure on everybody. This is what we
need.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan started off with three scoreless innings and gave up just
one run through six. By the time the Athletics scored in the fourth
on Jason Giambi's home run, the Rangers had already built up a 5-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates said three scoreless innings from a pitcher
to start a game, ``changes the whole attitude of the ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three shutout innings is the bottom line, but not even being
in trouble, facing only nine, 10 or 11 batters. It gives the whole
ballclub a lift. I don't think you can measure it.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the numbers are pretty clear when you break down the
Rangers 7-6 record.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are 7-0 when they score first, and an opponent has
yet to come from behind to beat them.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers opponents have scored in the first inning in six games
this year. The Rangers have lost all six.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have to go out and hit no matter what the pitcher
does,'' second baseman Mark McLemore said. ``The first couple of
games in here we didn't swing the bats well. I think everybody had
in mind today to get a good pitch to hit and be more aggressive,
and we did that for the most part.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan faltered in the seventh, giving up a leadoff double to
Matt Stairs and a run-scoring single to Ben Grieve. That made it
6-2, and Oates quickly got him out of there, turning the game over
to Jeff Zimmerman and John Wetteland
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the kind of pitcher that comes out going hard, one pitch
at a time and one hitter at a time,'' Morgan said. ``I'm usually
pretty good the first time through an order, and I'm usually good
for five or six innings. After that it's when I seem to labor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers can handle that from a pitcher. It's getting behind
early that's been driving them crazy. But by pitching well early,
Morgan has won both his starts and is off to a 3-0 start (one
victory in relief) for the first time since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things I've seen since spring training is good movement on
all his pitches and throwing all his pitches for strikes when he
wants to,'' Oates said. ``He stays down, going up only when he
wants to, and he changes speeds. From what I've seen, he's doing
all the things he needs to do to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important on that list is not letting the other team get
the jump on the Rangers' offense.
</P>

said. ``All that goes hand in hand. You do that consistently and
you're going to have a successful season.'' nn

PALMEIRO SAYS HIS TIMING IS COMING BACK

<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Rafael Palmeiro, showing signs of overcoming
his lost spring training, went 4-for-4 Sunday with a sacrifice fly
in his five plate appearances. He has six hits in his past eight
at-bats, including a home run on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm now just feeling that my timing is getting there,''
Palmeiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, who had two knee surgeries in two months and also has
a tight hamstring muscle, showed a little speed when he doubled in
the seventh, his second of the season. He had two line drives off
the right-field wall in the three-game series with the Seattle
Mariners and had to settle for singles both times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it speed, but the knee feels better,''
Palmeiro said. ``But the hamstring is bothering me a little bit. I
just want to be normal. I want to feel good again so I can run hard
and not hurt my team.''
OQUIST, PHILLIPS EXIT EARLY
</P>
<P>
   Two Oakland starters made premature exits from Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitcher Mike Oquist was knocked out of the game in the
third inning when he took a line drive off the left wrist. Rusty
Greer hit the ball, a smash that went for an infield hit.
</P>
<P>
   Oquist was taken to a local hospital for X-rays, that showed no
fractures. He's expected to make his next start.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Tony Phillips was ejected in the sixth inning by
home plate umpire Dan Morrison for arguing balls and strikes.
Phillips had just struck out for the second time in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was between me and the umpire and nobody else's
business,'' Phillips said. ``I'm good for three or four times a
year and that was No. 1. I wasn't doing the team any good, anyway,
two strikeouts and a ground out.''
ZEILE SPARKLES
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Todd Zeile bailed out starting pitcher Mike Morgan
with two nice defensive plays early.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics had a runner at second with two out in the second
when Zeile backhanded Miguel Tejada's bouncer deep behind the bag
and made a strong throw to first to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile also came through in the third after Morgan started the
inning by walking Eric Chavez. A.J. Hinch followed with a sharp
grounder toward the left side hole and Zeile made a diving stop to
his left, taking away a hit and getting a force at second on
Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big play, getting to that ground ball,'' manager
Johnny Oates said. ``Anytime you make plays like that, the pitching
gets a little better.'' BRONX BROWNOUT
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers open up a two-game series with the New York Yankees
tomorrow night at Yankee Stadium, a place that has not been
friendly to the Rangers in the past. The Rangers are 51-102 in New
York since 1972, their worst record in any city in the American
League. A look at the Rangers record in each city: City W-L Pct.
Oakland 93-91 .505 Cleveland 77-76 .502 Seattle 72-72 .500

<P>
   _ Designated hitter Mike Simms, on the disabled list with a
partially torn Achilles tendon, played in his first game with the
Triple-A Oklahoma Redhawks Sunday and had a two-run single and a
walk in four plate appearances. The Rangers are hoping Simms can be
activated when they return to The Ballpark in Arlington next
Monday.

SUNS SWEEP SEASON SERIES AS SONICS STUMBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A game official approached Sonics coach Paul Westphal
early Sunday and requested a starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal refused.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed about coaching for the first time in the building
where he was axed three years ago, Westphal recoiled his emotions.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until after the Sonics stumbled down the stretch of
Sunday's 99-93 loss to the Phoenix Suns that Westphal dropped his
shield. Unfortunately for Westphal, his Sonics were not as guarded
as long.
</P>
<P>
   In what was essentially the umpteenth must-win game this week,
the Sonics battled the Suns for 3{ quarters. But it didn't take a
genius to figure out why Westphal screamed: ``Don't foul. Just let
it end,'' with eight seconds left in the game. At that point,
winning was as hopeless as the final six minutes were for the
Sonics at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 85-84, the Sonics committed four straight turnovers
without scoring a field goal. They were beaten to loose balls and
outworked for rebounds. That stretch was enough to allow Phoenix
(21-20) to end with a 14-9 run and beat the Sonics (19-21) for the
third time this season and a first-ever sweep of their
regular-season series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't finish the game,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was the Sonics' second straight after Friday's
30-point loss at home to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to get on a roll for a month, the Sonics are floundering
toward the finish line. It is possible a playoff berth might not be
waiting at the end of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics fell 1{ games behind the Suns, who own the seventh
seed and the tie-breaker edge in the Western Conference playoff
race. The Sonics are clinging to the No. 8 spot, just one game up
on Sacramento and Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both like 20-20,'' forward Vin Baker said of Phoenix.
``I don't think it means much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' record tumbled two games below .500 for the first
time this season. The team has 10 games left.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Sonics did not earn a playoff berth was the
1989-90 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a huge game,'' Westphal said. ``If we win enough
games, we can still make the playoffs. If we make the playoffs and
heal up some of the places where we've been hurting this year, then
we can win some playoff games. But we have to find a way to put
together a run. We've been sputtering all season, but we're not
going to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal continued his course in patchwork, using yet another
starting lineup in an attempt to match the Suns' height and
offensive firepower. Only seven players saw time for the Sonics,
and it was a strange rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Baker started at center in place of Olden Polynice. The boldest
move, though, was starting Don MacLean at power forward. MacLean
had missed 33 games this season. However, he held his own against
the Suns' Tom Gugliotta, who led all scorers with 27 points and 12
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean, who had scored a total of 21 points this season, had 16
Sunday in 36 minutes. Gary Payton led the Sonics with 21 points and
11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were playing their fourth game in five days. They
finish off a grueling week tonight against the Houston Rockets at
the Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   Neither lineups nor fatigue was a major factor. Phoenix edged
the Sonics in rebounding, 41-40. Critical, though, was that the
Suns collected 20 offensive boards and beat the Sonics on the glass
14-9 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our chance,'' said forward Detlef Schrempf, who
finished with 20 points and 10 rebounds. ``We knocked the ball
loose and didn't come up with it. And we didn't get rebounds. It's
the same old story.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix had beaten the Sonics just five days earlier at
KeyArena, when Seattle collected a record NBA-low 19 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Sonics tied the game twice in the fourth before
unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got all of the big rebounds,'' Westphal said of the Suns.
``We were in control of the boards most of the game. Then, they got
the ones they needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what happened to the Sonics, Schrempf shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. Not yet. We just haven't executed,'' he said.
``That's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   And it could get worse.

STARS DEFENSE STEPS UP TO THE FRONT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Jennings Trophy was added to the Stars' trophy case
Sunday night, and the accomplishment was not without some
significance both for the past and the future.
</P>
<P>
   In holding down the potent Colorado Avalanche in a 2-1 loss at
McNichols Arena in the season finale, the Stars not only locked up
the honor of the fewest goals against (168) in the NHL during the
1998-99 season, they also made a statement about their defense and
the depth of their goaltending.
</P>
<P>
   With Derian Hatcher (suspended), Richard Matvichuk (groin) and
Shawn Chambers (healthy scratch) out of the lineup, the Stars
relied on a patchwork defense and received steady results. Darryl
Sydor played 28 minutes, 53 seconds and helped replace the physical
presence of Hatcher and Matvichuk. Sergei Zubov logged 30:25 of ice
time. Doug Lidster was good for 17:53 and Craig Ludwig played
16:44.
</P>
<P>
   Rookies Petr Buzek and Brad Lukowich were limited to 13 minutes
or less, but Chambers and Matvichuk should be ready for the playoff
opener on Wednesday, meaning the Stars still have strong defensive
depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked what I saw; we're playing hard back there,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``Obviously, you can't just replace
Hatcher and Matvichuk, but we've done a good job of playing through
adversity back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Manny Fernandez took the loss in net, but stopped 27 shots and
basically matched All-Star Patrick Roy save-for-save. That
performance is a gentle reminder the Stars have one more name to
consider in their goalie shuffle this summer. The team will be able
to protect either Ed Belfour or Roman Turek in the expansion draft,
and the Atlanta Thrashers will get dibs on either of those goalies,
if one isn't traded beforehand. But with Fernandez, 24, and Marty
Turco, 23, in the system, the Stars should still have a solid
goaltending pair next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manny is proving himself a good goalie,'' said Hitchcock, who
has worked with Fernandez for the past five seasons. ``He's matured
as an individual, he's lost some of the edginess that was a
problem. He's a good goalie.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, who will be a restricted free agent this summer, said
he would like to stay in the Stars' system, but that he has to
start looking for any chance to move into the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to stay with the Stars, I think they'll be a good
team for years to come,'' he said. ``But at the same time, five
years is enough. I have to start watching out for myself.''
JENNINGS TALK
</P>
<P>
   The Jennings award is given to the NHL team that allows the
fewest goals in the regular season, and the Stars had made the
award a priority throughout the season. They missed the award by
one goal last season, finishing behind the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   While the award will bear the name of Belfour (for the fourth
time in his career) and Turek, it's actually something that is
earned by the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of work and a lot of sacrifice and not a whole
lot of nights off,'' Hitchcock said. ``It's about consistent team
defense and that's something we've tried to build around.'' OLD
FRIENDS
</P>
<P>
   Stars winger Brett Hull wore No. 99 on the back of his helmet as
a tribute to his friend Wayne Gretzky, who was playing the final
game of his Hall-of-Fame career in New York.
</P>
<P>
   While Hull said he enjoyed fond memories with Gretzky, he added
that ``the most bitter moment'' of his career came in 1996 when the
St. Louis Blues acquired Gretzky in a trade with the Los Angeles
Kings and then decided not to sign him as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was ridiculous, embarrassing,'' Hull said. ``You don't
treat the greatest player in the game that way. I'll never forget
that.'' NOTABLES
</P>
<P>
   _ The Stars posted the most victories in franchise history (51)
_ tied for the 19th most in NHL history.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Stars posted the most points (114) in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hull led the NHL in game-winning goals with 11 and tied a
franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grant Marshall was the only Stars player to play in all 82
games.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Stars had the best home record (29-8-4) in the NHL and the
second-best road record (22-11-8).
</P>
<P>
   _ Avalanche goalie Patrick Roy posted a career best
goals-against average of 2.29.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avalanche winger Milan Hejduk finished as the NHL rookie
scoring leader with 48 points. HATCHER FALLOUT
</P>
<P>
   People in Phoenix are upset by the ``lightness'' of Derian
Hatcher's seven-game suspension. Hatcher was fined $90,731 or two
games worth of $3.7 million salary. That's because NHL players are
officially paid only during the regular season, and the remainder
of Hatcher's five suspended games come in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   However, Phoenix television analyst Jim Johnson, a former
Hatcher teammate on the Stars, said Hatcher should pay the $317,558
fine he would have received had all seven games been during the
regular season. THREE STARS
</P>
<P>
   1. Patrick Roy, Avalanche: Had 30 saves against some great
scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   2. Theo Fleury, Avalanche: Gets game-winner with 12.7 seconds
remaining and assists on first goal.
</P>
<P>
   3. Manny Fernandez, Stars: He deserved a better fate. In his
last two NHL games, he's stopped 59 of 62 shots. X-FACTOR:
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' crippled defense was facing an Avalanche team that
was at full strength and featured three of the top seven scorers in
the NHL. The Stars are proving they have the depth to survive in
the playoffs.

HUARD'S FUTURE IN TALENTED HANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The gray skies cleared, revealing snow-capped
mountains set against a gorgeous blue horizon. It was exactly the
kind of day everyone promised Mike Holmgren happens in Seattle, the
kind of weather for which there is every reason to believe
everything is going to be all right.
</P>
<P>
   Brock Huard's NFL fate was sealed last Thursday, under nearly
blissful conditions.
</P>
<P>
   That was the day Seahawks coaches, coordinators and the
franchise's new, impressive leader decided to take a trip across
Lake Washington to the University of Washington. It was time for
the Seahawks to complete their detailed investigation of the
prototypical NFL quarterback whose stock was in the Dumpster.
</P>
<P>
   Was this lefty slinger really the shell-shocked, gun-shy,
off-balance, back-footed thrower his detractors had pegged him? Or
was this Huard a solid pro pick whose potential could be realized
with time, patience and persistence under one of the NFL's master
motivators and cultivators of quarterbacks?
</P>
<P>
   When Holmgren used a third-round pick to take Huard in this
weekend's NFL draft, the answer was obvious. All of Huard's
so-called flaws have been deemed correctable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a project, but some projects are a risk. Brock is not a
risk,'' Seahawks offensive coordinator Mike Sherman said Sunday.
``For Mike to choose him in the third round means there is a
legitimate amount of expectation that this will be successful, for
both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brock put himself in a position to come in and be competitive.
... This is a good learning experience for Brock, and when it comes
to quarterbacks, or anyone, Mike Holmgren knows what buttons to
push.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it did not hurt that the day the new Seahawks
leadership posse headed west to Montlake for Huard's last-look
workout, Seattle looked like God's country.
</P>
<P>
   And on that day, one very devout Christian young man who had
worn the weight of the world on his shoulders was helped toward an
instructive revelation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, he's a talented guy,'' Holmgren said about the
newest quarterback he will add to his heady class list that already
has included Joe Montana, Steve Young and Steve Bono in San
Francisco and Brett Favre, Ty Detmer and Mark Brunell in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He now just has (to deal with) pressure. The pressure we have
to be careful of is the pressure he will put on himself,'' Holmgren
said. ``I believe he has done that, to his detriment. I sense that
he has put that (on himself.) It's almost like he couldn't make a
mistake. Heck, it's still a game. They are not robots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Bono was a classic. He over-analyzed everything. No one
can compute that much information and act upon it. So just have a
couple things and then cut it loose. Throw it. Run. Do whatever,
but don't paralyze yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Things are starting to turn out all right for Huard, who
deserves this chance and who must feel, just like first-round
Seahawks pick Lamar King said Sunday, that coming to Seattle means
playing for one of the best coaches in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren admits that no matter how high up the food chain he
ascends, he is first and foremost still a lover of quarterbacks _
developing them by giving them the techniques, formations, reads,
confidence, instructions and green light to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren puts a premium on this particular talent of his. He
sees Huard as another gem he can help polish, as long as Huard is
willing to ingest the instruction on West Coast offense and let the
pro game come to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our workout the other day, he really had a fine workout.
But you know, one ball sailed a little bit on him, and he went (and
got really flustered and upset)'' Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Goodness gracious.' I drove over the bridge, and if
you remember that day, it was fabulous. So I'm seeing the sun on
the lake and the mountains and I'm standing there on the practice
field and I told Brock: `Hey, look around. Look at this. You're
doing fine.' But I think he wants it so bad, one of my jobs is
going to be to get him just to back off and look at it and enjoy
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first NFL draft as both head coach and team vice
president, Holmgren was determined to have fun, stockpile players
at positions where depth was lacking, make an impact on his new
team's talent pool.
</P>
<P>
   For all the hype and paralysis by over-analysis that accompanies
the NFL draft _ a non-event that somehow blusters itself to World
Wrestling Federation proportion _ Holmgren did manage to show as
much about himself.
</P>
<P>
   By picking Huard, Holmgren is giving him the opportunity to
re-invent himself right here at home.
</P>
<P>
   By picking Huard, Holmgren has all but made a commitment to
helping him prove all those critics and naysayers were too hard on
the kid.
</P>
<P>
   Huard may have been born to be a quarterback. He may have been
raised to be a quarterback. He may have dreamed of being an NFL
quarterback. But it is Holmgren who can push him to that final,
ultimate destination.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, Huard may be better off than guys named Kerry
Collins or Ryan Leaf, Tim Couch or Akili Smith.

SEAHAWKS FOLLOW WELL-MADE PLAN, FILL MOST NEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Add another handle to Mike Holmgren's
ever-expanding list of job titles _ the man with the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks executive vice president of football
operations/general manager and head coach waded into the first NFL
draft in which he had total control with an aggressive agenda
Saturday morning and emerged Sunday afternoon with a smile and
seven almost handpicked players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, Mike was in control,'' defensive coordinator
Fritz Shurmur said. ``He had a plan. He exhibited his ability to be
able to take his resources and use them and come up with the best
conclusions for the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Holmgren had turned five draft picks into
seven players and filled all but one of the team's needs entering
the two-day event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun. It was exciting,'' said Holmgren, who was hired in
January to control the Seahawks' football operation after seven
seasons as coach of the Green Bay Packers. ``If you look at the
players we did get in the draft, you see that we addressed some
needs as well as got some real fine players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming out it,'' he added, ``I am very, very pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-day efforts of Holmgren and his draft team might not
yield an opening-day starter but did stock an already solid roster
with more depth, talent and versatility _ defensive end Lamar King,
quarterback Brock Huard and wide receiver Karsten Bailey in
Saturday's first three rounds; defensive end Antonio Cochran,
tackle Floyd Wedderburn, kick returner Charlie Rogers and
cornerback Steve Johnson in Sunday's final four rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren added three picks by trading down twice in the first
round and still got the player he would have selected at No. 17 _
King, a 297-pounder who could challenge for a starting job and at
the very least be used in a rotation at defensive end or/and
tackle.
</P>
<P>
   The extra picks the Seahawks got from the New England Patriots
and Dallas Cowboys for moving down five spots in the first round
where used to grab Bailey in the third round and to trade up in the
sixth round to select Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren was not alone in the ``war room'' and shared credit for
all this wheeling, dealing and stealing with vice president of
football operations Randy Mueller, director of player personnel
John Dorsey, his assistant coaches and the team's scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about the whole process and how we came out of the
draft,'' Holmgren said. ``It was a real team effort.''
</P>
<P>
   But the point man was Holmgren, who cut his drafting teeth under
Bill Walsh as an assistant coach with the San Francisco 49ers and
honed those skills while working with Packers general manager Ron
Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there were any doubts Holmgren could pull off a
successful draft in his first attempt, Shurmer offered, ``Of course
not. No. One of the things that everybody recognizes is that he has
had a great command of offensive football and what it takes to
coach the football team. But there was never any doubt in our minds
about his ability to judge and select talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren showed he also is a team player by going for a
defensive player in the first round when there were tempting
alternatives on the offensive side.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an indication of the fact that he is the head coach of
the whole football team and has an interest in all of it,'' said
Shurmur, unable to hold back a smile.
</P>
<P>
   An indication that Holmgren also is a bit of perfectionist came
in the amount of time he spent dwelling on the one player that got
away _ a pass-catching tight end. He had hoped to draft either
North Alabama's Bobby Collins, who went to Buffalo in the fourth
round, or Michigan's Jerame Truman, who was taken by Pittsburgh in
the fifth round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like body punches when they were taken,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren didn't recoil, however, he struck back, using a
fifth-round pick to fill a need by taking the best punt returner in
the draft, Rogers, and giving up two picks in the sixth round to
make sure he got the cornerback he wanted, Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   No tight ends, but players who should help that Seahawks end the
league's longest playoff drought at 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than that,'' Holmgren said of not getting a tight end,
``it kind of fell together.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as planned.

ARIZONA LAWMAKERS MAY LAUGH TO KEEP FROM CRYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ (SECOND OF THREE PARTS) The jokes have been making the
rounds all morning in the Arizona House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   They involve Rep. Kathleen Dunbar, R-Tucson, who moderate
legislators believe agreed to cave in to conservative leaders on a
crucial vote on the state budget. Dunbar, an animal rights
activist, has been pushing her own legislation against animal
cruelty and domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Susan Gerard, leader of the moderate ``Mushroom
Coalition,'' repeats one of the jokes to a group of fellow
legislators: ``Did you hear that leadership is threatening Dunbar?
They say they've gone to the animal shelters and they'll be killing
one animal every hour until she gives in.''
</P>
<P>
   The group chuckles and another adds: ``I heard the Mushrooms
have kidnapped her dog. They told her she'll never see her dog
alive again if she caves in.''
</P>
<P>
   More laughter. For a moment, the jokes seem to reflect the
legislators' own brand of cruelty toward a freshman who dared
abandon the moderate coalition. But Gerard explains the jokes are a
cover. The stress is so great that lawmakers are alleviating their
anxiety with humor. The situation, she confesses, really isn't
funny at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arizona Republic'' followed Gerard from April 5-9 during a
crucial week in this year's legislative session, filled with the
tension of an impending budget deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday _ deals and rumors in the hallways''.``''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the morning, rumors are making the rounds. A Mushroom
is already questioning the loyalty of Rep. Tom Horne, R-Paradise
Valley, and is reporting back to Gerard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horne says he's solid. He says he's still on,'' she tells some
fellow lawmakers. ``But he says he's heard some other people were
going to double-cross him.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Everyone thinks he knows who is on the verge of changing
positions in the battle over the budget. But in the end, Gerard
says, it may be impossible to know who is jumping sides. By the
time members vote on the issue, she says the budget is bound to be
radically different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they confess,'' Gerard says, ``we can never know for
sure. And who's going to do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Gerard sighs heavily. The chime summoning legislators back to
work has sounded again.
</P>
<P>
   A House page dashes down the hallway, rounding up stragglers.
Dressed in the blue jacket and slacks that distinguish these House
gofers, a lanky, blond page politely knocks on doors and tells the
lawmakers it's time to go.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the morning, they duck in and out of a private lobby
that connects to the floor. There's news that leadership is
softening on funds for education. Gerard roams the floor and pays a
few visits to the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she settles in at her desk. But this day's session
already is about to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a really short session,'' she says as she steps into
the hallway. ``Leadership must be anxious to work more people over
today.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no time to worry about it, though. Fourth-graders from
Lookout Mountain are visiting the House today and Gerard must
address them.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for them in the House Gallery, Rep. Roberta Voss,
R-Glendale, storms in, plops herself down on a step and reveals:
``They've called me into their office. What's our story?''
</P>
<P>
   Gerard responds: ``I don't know, but I'm sticking with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, everyone seems to be restless and on edge.
</P>
<P>
   But the children visiting the Legislature don't notice a
thing. &UR; They giggle and whisper as they climb the stairs, enter the
gallery &UR; and peer onto the vacant floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess nothing is going on today,'' a parent tells her
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Just then Minority House Leader John Loredo whips past.
Some &UR; freshman Democrats are in crisis and he's trying to hold
them &UR; together.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're hearing rumors about the budget and I'm trying to
keep &UR; them from joining the leadership,'' Loredo explains. ``If I
can do that, &UR; it gives the Mushrooms more bargaining power. The
moderate Republicans, more or less, want the same thing we do.''
</P>
<P>
   After addressing the schoolchildren, Gerard is eager to get the
scoop. &UR; She persuades fellow Mushrooms Reps. Carolyn Allen and
Lou-Ann Preble to get away for lunch today. At Tom's Tavern, a
favorite hangout for lawmakers, they share the latest intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   All have heard various reports that leadership could be
softening on money for schools. Grilled by House leaders earlier,
Horne confirms the news when they arrive back in the Legislature
for their Republican caucus meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Ushering Gerard into a first-floor hallway, Horne produces a
legal pad and shows her the numbers. Leadership, he says excitedly,
is offering some money for schools but nothing for cities or
community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to know if this will pass. What do you think?''
Horne asks.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard is pleased with the funds for education. But she's still
concerned about financing for the cities and community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Oblivious to the development, Republican lawmakers sit in
caucus &UR; and listen to the bills on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In caucus, legislative analysts read bills and discuss what each
would do. Sitting around a conference table, the lawmakers
ask &UR; questions. Chairs line the walls, and advocates from various
industries &UR; fill them.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with cell phones, pagers and notebooks, the lobbyists
keep &UR; elaborate records on the bills and amendments. At times, some
rush out of &UR; the room to call their employers with the news. When
the caucus is finished, the lawmakers wait again for the session to
adjourn. But there's news that a vote could take place on
the &UR; budget.
</P>
<P>
   About 10:22 that night, the chime sounds and the weary
lawmakers &UR; trudge back onto the floor. If leadership &UR; decides to hear
the budget tonight, &UR; the session could last until dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard crosses her fingers. Sighs of relief go out when the
session is adjourned a minute later. Tired but heartened, coalition
members have won the battle today. Each day they hold off
leadership gives them hope that leadership could make concessions. &QL; 
Tuesday: The chamber and the midnight hour. &QL;

CLIPPERS CAN'T STOP VAN EXEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The homestretch of an NBA season can produce more
dog days than the Iditarod. But Sunday's expected flea market
turned into a surprisingly crisp struggle between the Clippers and
Denver Nuggets, who followed the lead of alpha dog Nick Van Exel
and trotted off with a 103-101 victory in front of 9,450 at the
Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a well-played game throughout,'' said
Clippers coach Chris Ford, in a declaration that _ in these parts _
could be answered with a lightning bolt. But Ford wasn't woofin';
his 7-33 team was guilty of seven of the game's measly 15
turnovers. In review, there was scoring, an occasional outbreak of
defense, Indiana farm-boy free-throw shooting (Denver made its
first 26 and finished 27 of 29), not to mention a fair share of
game-ending ethos and pathos.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just happened to make the last shot,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   The closing nail in question was driven home with 5.5 seconds
left by Van Exel on a 21-footer over the sticky defense of Troy
Hudson. That pushed the ex-Laker's point total to a game-high 34,
inspired a howl of vindication from a substantial pack of diehard
Lakers/Van Exel fans and claimed victory for the worst road team
since ``Thelma and Louise.'' The 13-29 Nuggets now are 2-20 outside
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always love playing here (Sports Arena), because it has such
a college atmosphere,'' said Van Exel, who had 41 points in a
recent losing return to the Forum recently. His late heroics
included a stunning 20-footer from the left baseline that gave
Denver a 101-99 lead with 36.5 to play. ``There are always a lot of
young kids here yelling and screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   And a few Clippers pups swearing in private.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good player and he had it cooking at the end,'' said
Hudson, the Clippers' understudy at point guard. ``Whenever you
play a player like that, you've got to bring your `A' game.''
</P>
<P>
   Clippers power forward Maurice Taylor earned his letter by
scoring a career-high 26 points, the last pair coming on a slick
drive and left-handed flip to tie the score at 101 with 27.3 on the
clock. Taylor also bothered Antonio McDyess enough to make the
Nuggets star miss 9 of 16 field-goal attempts. McDyess finished
with 18 points and 10 rebounds. Center Danny Fortson, a 6-foot-7,
270-pounder who moves like an impatient avalanche, had 20 and 14.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Douglas had 14 points for the Clippers, who were treated
to robust bench contributions from Lorenzen Wright (14 rebounds,
nine points), Lamond Murray (14 points, six rebounds) and Rodney
Rogers (13 points).
</P>
<P>
   But when all the barking was over, the Clippers _ who led by
nine points on three second-quarter occasions and seemingly had
this game on a leash _ were bitten by another `L.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have won this game,'' said Douglas, as a matter of
record.
</P>
<P>
   But in a 7-33 season, that quote is a sign of improvement.

THIS WEEK'S TOO BUSY TO GET ANY REAL WORK DONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN SIDENER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's proclaim today (MONDAY) Try-to-Get-Some-Real &QL; 
-Work-Done Day.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, it needs to be adopted, proclaimed or otherwise
sponsored to fit in with the rest of the week. From bringing
daughters to work to honoring secretaries, almost every day this
week has been monikered for some cause. And Thursday has two.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday is Telework Greater Phoenix Day, which means we all
should be home wearing bathrobes as we type and handle the phones.
Razor stubble is mandatory for men. Makeup is banned for women.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are you've seen those studies saying telecommuting
increases productivity. Well, here's a little-known fact: All that
research was underwritten by America Online, the Golf Channel and
the Association of American Doctors Advocating Frequent Napping.
</P>
<P>
   So forget about getting anything done Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday is Professional Secretaries Day. Prepare for a long
line when you stop at the florist on your way to work. You'll get
to your desk an hour and a half late, barely in time to get a lunch
reservation. So write off 2{ hours for lunch. By the time you get
back to the office, you'll barely have time to answer Tuesday's
e-mail. And of course, none of the Phoenix area's secretaries will
do a lick of work, further slowing our economic engine. The only
things staving off recession will be the record earnings reported
by florists and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday is Take Our Daughters to Work Day. Bring little Suzy to
work. Spend the morning introducing her to your co-workers, showing
her the water cooler and bathroom. Show her your computer and watch
her delete that spreadsheet you've been building for the past seven
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who have only sons or dogs will watch and know
you're not getting anything done. Out of resentment, we'll surf the
Internet and make long-distance calls to friends in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   And if Take Our Daughters to Work Day isn't enough to send half
our businesses filing for Chapter 7, Thursday is also Earth Day. We
can't throw away any of the day's junk mail. We'll have to find
someplace to recycle it. Can't drive, either; that would waste gas.
We'll be walking around town with junk mail in one hand and an
empty diet soda can in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, as always, is Casual Day. So far, it doesn't have any
other name. Maybe it'll end up as Bosses' Revenge Day. Or
Nobody-Goes-Home-Until-We're-Caught-Up Day.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull's office said there are no plans to proclaim
Friday as anything special. Similarly, a spokesman for Phoenix
Mayor Skip Rimsza said the mayor is not scheduled to rename Friday.
But whether or not any work gets done, Friday will have a special
description for the city's employees, spokesman Scott Phelps said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friday will be payday,'' Phelps said. ``You can't beat
that.'' &QL;

ANGELS BRAWL WITH MARINERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Ken Griffey Jr. didn't give the Angels the finger _ he
gave them the pointed-bat instead before an old-fashioned
middle-of-April brawl broke out Sunday at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over _ after three Angels and Griffey were tattooed
by pitches _ the Mariners defeated the Angels for the second
consecutive night 8-5 in front of 37,465 to take two of the three
in the weekend series.
</P>
<P>
   The melee started in the third inning when Griffey was hit in
the back with a two-out, bases-empty fastball from Angels starter
Steve Sparks. As Griffey walked to first, he pointed his bat toward
the Angels dugout _ as if to signal this was far from over. Edgar
Martinez followed with a double to right and Jay Buhner knocked a
two-run homer to give Seattle a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was the Mariners turn to plunk.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus led off the fourth inning with a solo homer to
left-center off Seattle starter Brett Hinchliffe. The next pitch,
Hinchliffe nailed Todd Greene on the left elbow. Green charged
Hinchliffe as if he were trying out for the NFL draft, and both
dugouts and bullpens met at the mound to settle matters for the
next 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Because Greene charged the mound so quickly, it took some time
for his teammates to help him.
</P>
<P>
   ``With those screens they put up (by the dugout as the result of
Mo Vaughn's injury opening day) all my players had to run around it
to get me some help,'' Greene said. ``But I got there pretty
fast....''
</P>
<P>
   Greene didn't think Hinchliffe's throw was the result of
Griffey's taunting an inning earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw what he (Griffey) did, but if they wanted to retaliate
for hitting Junior, they would have done it that same inning,''
Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Greene and Hinchliffe were both tossed along
with Angels pitcher Tim Belcher, who had no idea why he was
ejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about it,'' said Belcher. ``I didn't get
an explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins and Griffey had a few words during
the altercation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's between him and I. I told him it was a nice day at the
park,'' Collins said sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   Greene said ever since Glaus and Orlando Palmeiro were hit by
Seattle starter Jamie Moyer on Friday, tensions have been tight.
</P>
<P>
   After Glaus smacked that homer and he was hit by Hinchliffe,
Greene said he had no choice but to test his right cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to hit people, you got to understand we're
going to hit you back,'' said Greene. ``I don't know what he
(Hinchliffe) was thinking, but in my opinion it was on purpose and
you have to let them know enough is enough. Whether it serves a
purpose or not, I don't know, but I'm not going to take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like Troy tried to pimp that home run. He ran around
the bases like you're supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   With a 5-3 lead, Seattle struck again in the fifth. Martinez hit
his second double of the night to score Griffey from second. The
Mariners added another run before the inning was over to take a 7-3
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro was hit with a curveball to lead off the fifth inning
for the Angels. Randy Velarde followed with a double down the
left-field line to score Palmeiro; Valerde reaching third on the
play at the plate. Darin Erstad walked (runners on the corners),
then Tim Salmon singled to center, scoring Velarde, cutting
Seattle's lead to 7-5, but that was as close as the Angels would
come.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Claude (1-1) picked up the victory for Seattle. Sparks (0-3)
suffered the loss for the Angels.

CARDS GET HIGH MARKS FOR DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Warts and all, the Cardinals' seven second-day
draft picks offer intrigue, not because they are established stars
but because the team's brass believes they can overachieve and
become productive pros.
</P>
<P>
   That's not just the company line. National draft analysts concur
that the Cardinals followed one of their best drafts ever in 1998
with another. Everyone from Mel Kiper, Jr. to Marty Schottenheimer
was quick to offer praise for the manner in which the team got
high-quality players on Saturday and addressed needs in lower
rounds on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For that to be borne out, though, the Cardinals need some of
those players selected in rounds four through seven on Sunday, who
do not have what Coach Vince Tobin calls ``the measurables you'd
like,'' to make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a lot of role players,'' said Bob Ferguson, Cardinals
vice president of player personnel. ``We got guys who love to play
the game, character guys, who will be part of the 45-man roster on
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the intriguing players is sixth-round pick Jacoby
Rhinehart, a cornerback from Southern Methodist who will challenge
1997 third-round pick Ty Howard for a roster spot. Rhinehart was
the Mustangs' most versatile player. He also returned punts, caught
passes and ran reverses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt strongly about his athletic ability,'' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though at 5 feet 10 he is an inch taller than Howard,
Rhinehart still is not as big or as fast as the defensive backs
drafted Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kept showing up on him was that he can really turn his
hips and that he has great catch-up speed,'' Tobin said. ``He
intrigues us as a corner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, after drafting help at wide receiver, offensive
left tackle, and linebacker in the opening three rounds Saturday,
on Sunday added fullback Joel Makovicka of Nebraska in the fourth.
They've tried for three years to land a big back who can play.
Makovicka, at 234 pounds, can move a pile. But at 5 feet 10 he is
about three inches short and a step behind the big-time prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he can be a special player for us,'' Tobin said. ``He
can block. He has excellent hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Makovicka acknowledged that concerns over his receiving ability
knocked him down in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people thought I would go on the first day, and when
I didn't, it was kind of frustrating,'' Makovicka said. ``I have a
lot of confidence in my abilities and I come from a program where I
take pride in my blocking. I think the biggest thing I had to show
the scouts was that I could catch. I feel I can come in and do
whatever it takes, whether it's special teams, carrying the
football, or catching it.''
</P>
<P>
   He will be challenged by sixth-round pick Dennis McKinley (6-1,
241), of Mississippi State. McKinley is the perfect size for a pro
fullback, but has limited skills. He is primarily a blocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fullback who can move a linebacker out of a hole,''
Tobin said. ``We've been looking for a back like that for some
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, the Cardinals added depth at safety in the fifth
round with Paris Johnson of Miami (Ohio), who at 6-2, 208 would
have projected higher absent the knee injury that limited him to
five games last season; offensive guard Yusuf Scott of Arizona,
another fifth-round pick, who has battled weight problems but says
he now is down to 320; sixth-round pick Melvin Bradley, who at 6-1,
269 will be moved to middle linebacker because he is too small to
play defensive end in the NFL as he did at Arkansas; and
seventh-round pick Chris Greisen, a contender for the No. 3
quarterback spot after rebounding from a major knee injury in high
school to lead Northwest Missouri State to a 15-0 mark and the NCAA
Division II title.
</P>
<P>
   With this draft, the Cardinals believe they have created
competition along the offensive line, added run-stopping ability to
the defense, and addressed most specific position needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly like to have people think you did the right
thing,'' Tobin said of the national accolades that began pouring in
from national draft analysts. ``We felt like we got some people who
will help the football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to the middle and lower rounds you take players
you think can be really good football players. Whether they've got
all the measurables you'd like is probably doubtful. But we think
they can be productive players.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said the Cardinals' selections were the product of ``a
lot of changes'' in the way the club approached the draft. He said
the Cardinals make do with an undersized scouting department,
getting away with it because Rod Graves, the new assistant to the
president, has reorganized and computerized the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been big,'' Ferguson said. ``We got more thorough
reports on players. Also, we now know more about what Vince likes
as a coach. He's not afraid to sacrifice talent for character.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had evaluations on more than 700 players. They got
11 of the 253 drafted.

D-BACKS' OFFENSE HAS BEEN A BIG HIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Pitching, pitching and more pitching.
</P>
<P>
   That was supposed to be the cure-all for expansionitis, the
boost the Diamondbacks needed to become a competitive club in 1999
and perhaps even challenge for a wild-card playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   While the remodeled pitching staff has shown flashes of
potential in the early going, it has been the hitters carrying the
load.
</P>
<P>
   They did so again on Sunday in a 12-3 victory over the San
Francisco Giants at Bank One Ballpark, ripping two more home runs
and adding four doubles to score in double figures for the second
time in three games and third in 13.
</P>
<P>
   After four losses to start the season, Arizona has won six of
nine, including five of seven at home. They have home series
victories over two National League West Division opponents, the
Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one guy doing it. We all complement each other
well. We all feel that we can help,'' said second baseman Jay Bell,
who produced an RBI double in a seven-run seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Gilkey hit a three-run, pinch-hit homer in that inning
and left fielder Luis Gonzalez added a two-run shot to give Arizona
a major league-leading 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``Success breeds confidence and we enjoy pulling for each
other,'' Bell said. ``That makes it easier to go out and compete.
We like what we've got here. We've played three good teams the last
two weeks (Giants, Dodgers and Atlanta Braves), and hopefully, we
can play like we have been.''
</P>
<P>
   When Giants shortstop Rich Aurilia ripped a three-run homer off
right-hander Armando Reynoso in the second inning, his third of the
series, it appeared the outcome would be a similar to Saturday,
when the Giants scored early and often on the way to an 8-5
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Bell took Reynoso aside and told him, ``You've had a bad inning.
So what? Just make your pitches and we'll score you some runs.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before the Diamondbacks backed up Bell's words.
</P>
<P>
   They scored four times in the third off right-hander Russ Ortiz,
on a bases-loaded walk to Travis Lee and a bases-loaded double off
the right-field fence by ex-Giant Matt Williams. It missed being a
grand slam by a couple of feet.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is off to one of the best starts of his career. He is
hitting .322 with three homers, 10 RBIs and five doubles. He has
gone to the opposite field, to right, on many of his hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take what I'm given,'' he said. ``There's not a whole lot of
pitches I've seen that have been driveable. There's no sense trying
to pull an outside pitch. I've tried it and it doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't think he hit the double that well, but it got the job
done.
</P>
<P>
   Damian Miller, catching his ninth straight game due to an injury
to Kelly Stinnett, got the job done with two outs in the sixth
inning. After fouling off several pitches from Ortiz on a 3-2
count, he lined a single just over the head of third baseman
Charlie Hayes and into left field to score Gonzalez with an
insurance run to make it 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may have been the biggest at-bat of the game,''
Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks scored seven times in the seventh to break the
game open against relievers Rich Rodriguez, Julian Tavarez and
Felix Rodriguez, a former Diamondback.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley started it with a single and Bell drove him in with
a double down the left-field line. Lee hit an opposite-field single
and Williams scored Bell with a high chopper to third. Gonzalez hit
his fifth home run of the season for two more runs and tied Bell
for the club lead with five homers.
</P>
<P>
   Tavarez walked Tony Batista and gave up a double to David
Dellucci. Felix Rodriguez came on to retire Miller on a pop-up and
then gave Gilkey a fastball right down the middle that Gilkey hit
into the left-field stands for his fourth homer of the season. &QL;

TALE OF 2 SUNS: GLORY, HEART ACHE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - One sat at one end of the court.
</P>
<P>
   The other sat at the other end until halftime when he rose from
his chair, smoothed his necktie and walked nervously to center
court.
</P>
<P>
   For two men, this was a special day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have many emotions and thoughts,'' one said. But he wasn't
about to share them. Paul Westphal's deepest feelings remain a
secret: ``I've never spilled my guts.''
</P>
<P>
   The other had so much he wanted to say that he didn't know where
to start. Tom Chambers gazed at the smiling faces around him. When
he began speaking from the heart, he had to pause several times and
take deep breaths to gather himself. When he felt the tears
quicken, he quickly made a joke.
</P>
<P>
   They are more than acquaintances. Westphal and Chambers are
long-time friends. They played against each other. They employed
the same agent. In 1988, when the Suns were looking over a list of
free agents, Westphal _ then a Suns assistant coach _ said, ``What
about Tom Chambers?''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers and Kevin Johnson resurrected the Phoenix Suns.
Westphal coached them both in 1993 when the team reached the NBA
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, they sat on either side of the scorer's table, worlds
apart. This was the first time Westphal had been in America West
Arena for a Suns game since the club fired him three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He downplayed the significance of his return. He said his
emotions were irrelevant because they ``had nothing to do with the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   But anyone who knows Westphal's competitive nature knows how
badly he wanted to win.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Colangelo was in the house. So was Cotton Fitzsimmons. So
were Kevin Johnson and Danny Ainge. Paul coached Ainge, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety minutes before tipoff, public-address announcer Jeff Munn
went to the visitors' locker room. He informed the Sonics coach
that Ainge would not identify his starting lineup until game time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that how it is?'' Westphal said. A smile touched his lips.
``Then tell him I'm not announcing mine either.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal respects Ainge as a coach. He loved him as a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always had a smile on his face,'' Paul said. ``He always
had ideas. And he wasn't afraid to take the big shot, that's for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The room Westphal occupied was small and spartan compared with
his old office down the hall. Ainge's office has a desk. A clock. A
TV. It had to feel strange returning to this building and all the
memories it holds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different,'' Westphal said, foreclosing questions about his
feelings, and the past.
</P>
<P>
   But Westphal is part of the arena and the Suns. He always will
be. The former Sun is a member of the team's new ``Ring of Honor.''
Other honorees are Alvan Adams, Walter Davis, Connie Hawkins and
Dick Van Arsdale. Chambers joined that select company of former
Suns during a halftime ceremony. Their youthful faces now appear on
the facing of the upper deck.
</P>
<P>
   Like Westphal, Chambers didn't leave here the way he wanted.
Chambers no longer was the star of the team in his last season in
Phoenix. Charles Barkley was. After the '93 Finals, Chambers didn't
attend the downtown parade honoring the Western Conference
champions.
</P>
<P>
   But six years later, he stood at center court, a different man,
a happier man, a changed man.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means more to Tom than the night he scored 60 points
against the Sonics,'' Fitzsimmons said.
</P>
<P>
   How much did this day mean?
</P>
<P>
   Westphal played Gary Payton 48 minutes. That's how badly he
wanted to win. Chambers turned his shining eyes to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm truly blessed . . . life is beautiful . . . thanks so very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   His smile spoke of the priceless joy of hearing it again, the
cheers, one more time.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns won Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``No fouls, Dale,'' the Sonics coach called out to Dale Ellis as
the seconds ticked off the clock. ``Let it end.''
</P>
<P>
   When it did, Westphal walked the length of the court and
congratulated Chambers. ``This is his day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics packed. Westphal got on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers walked to a white pickup truck. The one with Utah
plates that read, ``HAZ BEN.'' &QL;

SUNS MAKE MOST OF 2ND CHANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It was a momentous day at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   They placed former Suns star Tom Chambers in the Ring of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   Former Suns Coach Paul Westphal made his first return to the
building as coach of the Seattle Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   And the Suns won their third game in a row, beating the Sonics,
99-93, behind a 27-point, 12-rebound performance from forward Tom
Gugliotta, the guy who wears Chambers' No. 24 now.
</P>
<P>
   OK, in most seasons, three-game winning streaks are routine. But
nothing has been routine about this season or the Suns. Now,
however, that's just what the club is getting into. The result is a
7-3 record in April.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Suns a 1{-game lead over the Sonics and
pulled them closer to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the Western
Conference playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think guys are finally settling into their roles,'' said
forward Clifford Robinson, who scored 23 points, grabbed seven
rebounds and made a handful of crucial shots. ``I know it took
awhile, but guys are feeling comfortable now doing what they're
supposed to be doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of us all accepting those roles, whether
it's coming off the bench, defending, scoring. Right now is the
time to make a move, and that's a big part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics are moving just as quickly in the opposite direction
and are not adjusting to their roles.
</P>
<P>
   After learning just before tip-off that Don MacLean would start,
Seattle center Olden Polynice was unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal might have had some second thoughts after MacLean
dropped off Gugliotta with 1:10 to play, giving the Phoenix forward
a wide-open shot from 18 feet that Gugliotta hit for a 94-89 Suns
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm supposed to hit those, and I finally did,'' Gugliotta
said.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal said he went with MacLean because he's trying to win
games, not worry about the feelings of individual players at this
point in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the way he feels about it, fine,'' Polynice said.
``But show some respect, don't tell me about it a minute before I
go on the court. I've been in this league 14 years. I deserve
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be noted that it's what Polynice has done in those 14
years that dictates the level of respect he deserves. But none of
that matters to the Suns, who would love nothing more than to watch
the Sonics slip. Phoenix swept the season series, 3-0, against
their old nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   The difference was rebounding, particularly in the second half.
The Suns had 15 offensive rebounds and 17 second-chance points in
the second half. Danny Manning had six offensive rebounds.
Gugliotta, Robinson and center Joe Kleine each had four.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny Manning's tip-ins were really big,'' Suns Coach Danny
Ainge said. ``He had six offensive rebounds, and those were huge
because we couldn't make any shots from the outside. Those
second-chance points we got were big.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Jason Kidd, who is having the best shooting season of his
career, made only 4 of 16 shots. Rex Chapman hit 4 of 10, although
he was 2 of 3 from three-point range and hit a big one with 3:26 to
go that gave the Suns a four-point cushion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't throw it in the ocean,'' Kidd said. ``That's just
how it is sometimes. You have to just keep taking those shots. I
got good looks. Some were short, some were long.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kidd said the club's front line bailed out the guards with
the offensive rebounds, and he cited Manning's one-hand,
rebound-and-shoot basket as the third-quarter buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a huge tip-in because they had some momentum going,''
Kidd said. ``I thought that shot took a lot of the wind out of
their sails.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics had trimmed a seven-point deficit to a point before
Manning's tip-in.
</P>
<P>
   With a three-game streak, a game coming up Tuesday night in
Dallas and two games down the road with Minnesota, Kidd said the
Suns might as well shoot for more than just the Timberwolves. With
the Los Angeles Lakers seemingly self-destructing, why not go for
No. 5?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can win seven or eight in a row, we might finish higher
(than sixth),'' Kidd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think six is reachable,'' Robinson said. ``As for
fifth, I don't know. We would have to put together a helluva
finish.''

AYALA STARTS LIFE OUTSIDE CELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seventeen years ago, he was a future star. This week, he'll be
an ex-con.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tony Ayala, perhaps the most promising fighter of the early
1980s, will be released Tuesday from Bayside State Prison in
Leesburg, N.J., after serving 16 years of a 35-year sentence for
rape.
</P>
<P>
   Now 36, Ayala hopes to recover all the promise he had when he
was 20. Then, he was an unbeaten junior middleweight (22-0, 19 KOs)
whose ferocity fascinated fans and frightened foes. But his
greatest weapon inside the ropes could not be controlled outside of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 19, I was a junkie and a drunk, I was out of
control,'' Ayala told the Associated Press. ``Did I deserve to go
to prison? Damn right. Did I deserve to go to prison for 16 years?
That's another matter. The last 10 years were a waste of time and
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, a San Antonio native, was convicted on a charge of raping
a neighbor in Paterson, N.J. At the time, he was on probation for
beating a woman in the restroom of a San Antonio drive-in theater
and for breaking into a San Antonio home.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the past 16 years thinking about all he lost. And,
through it all, fans have not forgotten him. There's a lingering
fascination with Ayala, who was nicknamed El Torito. It's happened
to other fighters. Unfulfilled talent and long-term trouble always
manages to create a peculiar, almost mythological aura in this
crazy, conflicted business.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters have noticed.  &UR; Don Elbaum is selling Ayala's return to
the ring. Ayala's adviser is  &UR; Brian Raditz, a psychologist who
treated him during his first 4{ years in prison. His father,  &UR; Tony
Sr., will train his son.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years of prison food and not a single round of sparring
can't have helped. Elbaum says he wants to see whether any of
Ayala's skills are left in a bout against a nobody this summer in
San Antonio. Then, he would hope to put Ayala in against a faded
 &UR; Hector Camacho or an ever-aging  &UR; Roberto Duran.
</P>
<P>
   The dream is  &UR; Oscar De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   In a jailhouse interview, Ayala told ``Sport'' magazine that he
spent time in his cell daydreaming about standing over a fallen,
bloodied De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Could it happen? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Ayala has a tougher opponent in himself, anyway. He has
to learn how to live outside of those prison walls.
</P>
<P>
   Mayday, maybe &QL; 
If schedules, faxes and negotiations are any indication,  &UR; Michael
 &UR; Carbajal will be very busy next month.
</P>
<P>
   America Presents has him fighting his second comeback bout on
May 8 on a Telemundo-televised card from Miami. A contract has him
on a Telemundo card on May 15, also in Miami. A third possibility
is a bout on May 5 at Tucson. He figures to fight on one of those
three dates.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the possibilities indicate that there's still some
interest in the Phoenix fighter, who has not signed a long-term
deal with any of the major promoters. &QL; 
Briefly . . .  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carbajal stablemate  &UR; Ahmed Santos (25-2-4, 13 KOs) won a vacant
North American Boxing Federation title Friday with a unanimous
decision over Detroit super-lightweight  &UR; Patrick Thorns (20-3-1, 15
KOs) at Shreveport, La. The victory promises to put Santos among
the World Boxing Council's top 10.
</P>
<P>
   He's back:  &UR; Fidel Hernandez (15-2, 12 KOs), a promising junior
middleweight from Carbajal's gym, returned to the ring for the
first time in about a year with a second-round knockout Friday
night of  &UR; Ricky
 &UR; Walters (5-5), also at Shreveport.
</P>
<P>
   And  &UR; George Foreman summed it up when he described  &UR; Dennis
 &UR; Rodman-wannabe  &UR; Naseem Hamed 10 days ago in a victory over  &UR; Paul
Ingle by saying: ``I like what he did right there. He did something
stupid, and that's what he does best.'' &QL;

A LONG DAY AT LONG BEACH  
 MONTOYA'S LEAD KILLED SUSPENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Juan Montoya was too good, which is too
bad.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad because Montoya's dominance Sunday made the Toyota Grand
Prix of Long Beach too long and too boring.
</P>
<P>
   In one snoozer of a 25th anniversary race, Montoya led the final
40 laps and became the quickest Championship Auto Racing Teams
rookie to win since Nigel Mansell won his debut in the 1993 season
opener.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was a grand moment for Montoya and the Target/Chip
Ganassi Racing team, it almost was too unbearable to watch.
</P>
<P>
   In the final 37 laps in an 85-lap race held over a twisting
11-turn, 1.824-mile temporary street circuit, there were no _
repeat, no _ position changes among the top five finishing drivers,
and only four involving the sixth through 10th finishers.
</P>
<P>
   Yuck.
</P>
<P>
   But for Montoya and Ganassi, it might as well have been
Christmas, and they might as well have been kids again the way they
were high-fiving each other during a jubilant post-race victory
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in something so big,'' said Montoya, who led
by as many as 11.175 seconds before settling for a non-threatening
2.805-second victory over Dario Franchitti. ``It feels real good.''
</P>
<P>
   Good for Ganassi, too, and no wonder.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ganassi's fourth straight win at Long Beach, including
Jimmy Vasser's win in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Zanardi won the past two here, but when he chose to leave
this season for Formula One, it left Ganassi with a huge void to
fill.
</P>
<P>
   Ganassi chose to fill it with Montoya, last year's European
Formula 3000 champion.
</P>
<P>
   Smart move.
</P>
<P>
   Following respectable finishes of 10th and 13th in the season's
first two oval races, Montoya delivered a five-star performance on
the circuit's first road-course test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he (Montoya) had the talent for the kind of drive he
had today,'' a beaming Ganassi said afterwards. ``What I didn't
know is would he have the mental toughness to put (last week)
behind him. You don't usually see that in a young guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Japan, Montoya was fined $5,000 and put on
probation for a crash he caused involving Michael Andretti.
</P>
<P>
   For Montoya, the incident might as well have happened 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just decided to go out and race,'' Montoya said.
</P>
<P>
   And race he did.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Prix's first 45 laps, however, belonged to Bryan Herta
and pole-sitter Tony Kanaan.
</P>
<P>
   Herta, who started third and finished third, passed both Kanaan
and Franchitti on Lap 1 to take the lead in front of a crowd of
more than 90,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Kanaan immediately struck back, taking the lead just past
the start of Lap 2. And Kanaan remained on the point until disaster
struck on Lap 46.
</P>
<P>
   Kanaan slid off-course and slammed nose first into a protective
tire barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake,'' Kanaan said. ``The track was breaking up,
and I just drove off-line a little bit and lost it. Sometimes you
learn the hard way.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart goes out to (Kanaan),'' Ganassi said. ``He was doing
a heck of a job, and I don't know if we had enough for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya, too, was uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great car,'' Montoya said. ``We were at a pretty even
pace, and it would have been hard to overtake him.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchitti tried to overtake Montoya, but it was fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Even after rookie Christiano da Matta produced the last of five
caution flags on Lap 77 by smashing into the same tire barrier that
engulfed Kanaan, Franchitti still had nothing to throw at Montoya
when the race resumed on Lap 82.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing but false hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave it everything I had,'' Franchitti said. ``I just didn't
have the car to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there were concerns a reconfiguration of the course
layout might prove disastrous for over-zealous drivers attempting
to make side-by-side moves in the narrower portions of the layout,
most everyone behaved beautifully, and there were no serious
accidents.

<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ If &UR; Paul Tracy thought Sunday was a rough
day, wait until a few days from now.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy and wife &UR; Liisa are scheduled to appear on shock-jock
 &UR; Howard Stern's radio show later this week.
</P>
<P>
   As for Sunday, Tracy was forced out of the Toyota Grand Prix of
Long Beach on Lap 48 after he and  &UR; Michael Andretti made contact on
pit road.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I was leaving the pit lane, someone pulled out in front of
me, and I got hit,'' Tracy said. ``It broke the rear suspension.
It's a shame. We were quicker than everyone down the straightaways,
but it's so hard to pass here, and I just couldn't get by
anyone.'' &QL; 
Numbers game &QL; 
Rookie  &UR; Juan Montoya won in only his third career start.
</P>
<P>
   It took  &UR; Alex Zanardi nine races before he won, and  &UR; Jacques
Villeneuve 14. &UR; 
 &UR; Andre Ribeiro won in his 15th start, and  &UR; Gil de Ferran made it
into the victory lane in start No. 17. &QL; 
Short day &QL; 
Pole-sitter  &UR; Chris Neville of Scottsdale never made it past Lap 1
in the BFGoodrich Trans-Am race.
</P>
<P>
   Neville spun in the treacherous first corner and wasn't able to
continue, finishing 24th in a 25-car field.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Paul Gentilozzi won by 2.707 seconds over  &UR; John Miller. &QL; 
Aloha &QL; 
Here's the latest on the inaugural Hawaiian Super Prix, a $10
million Championship Auto Racing Teams non-points race scheduled
Nov. 13 on the island of Oahu at Barbers Point Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-hour event consists of two 60-minute heats. Sixteen
drivers will earn points each lap depending on where they are in
the running order. For example, the leader of each lap receives 16
points, followed by 15 for second place, 14 for third, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Points are tabulated after the first heat, which will determine
the starting lineup for the second heat.
</P>
<P>
   No points will be awarded in the second heat. The overall winner
will be determined by the driver crossing the finish line first.
</P>
<P>
   The champion receives $5 million, and the remaining $5 million
goes to the next 15 finishers. The pole-sitter gets $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The event will be shown on Showtime Pay-Per-View at a cost of
$19.95. Starting time is 6 p.m. Eastern time.
</P>
<P>
   Pit stops &QL; 
The last driver to win at Long Beach from the pole position was  &UR; Al
Unser &UR; Jr., who won in 1990. It's only been done five times in the
25-year history of the race.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Greg Moore finished eighth, but he retained a six-point lead in
the drivers standings over  &UR; Adrian Fernandez. Montoya moved from
ninth to seventh and trails by 16 points. &QL;

KJ WON'T PLAY THIS SEASON  
 ALSO DOUBTFUL ABOUT NEXT YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Kevin Johnson returned to an NBA playing floor on
Sunday, but not as a player. He was there to honor the past.
</P>
<P>
   The future will have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   After a ceremony honoring a former teammate, Tom Chambers, KJ
said he wouldn't sign with a playoff team. The former Suns guard
also expressed doubts about next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to play this season,'' KJ said after Chambers'
name was added to a ring of honor at halftime of a 99-93, Suns'
victory over the Seattle at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   About next season, KJ said: ``I don't think I'm going to play,
but I'm not going to rule it out until after the summer. I'll
evaluate it then.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Dennis Rodman, KJ is still eligible to join a roster.
Rodman is ineligible. The Los Angeles Lakers cut him Thursday, long
after an NBA-imposed deadline.
</P>
<P>
   A free agent released after midnight, March 18 is prohibited
from signing with another team. The rule is intended to prevent
teams out of the playoffs from helping contenders in exchange for
some sort of under-the-table compensation.
</P>
<P>
   KJ, 33, looked as fit as he had in any of his 11 seasons with
the Suns. Could he play if he had a sudden change of heart?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' said the former playmaker, who is the franchise's
all-time leader in assists. ``My body's better than it's ever been.
I can walk up stairs and it doesn't hurt. I feel great.''
</P>
<P>
   KJ said he was approached by teams before and after the season
began in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told everybody no,'' he said. ``Every team called _ the
Lakers right off the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   He said loyalty to the Suns makes it difficult for him to play
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to put on another uniform,'' he said. ``Iknew
that all along. I knew when I stepped down from here that it would
be almost impossible for me to play anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are remote that he would ever put on a Suns' uniform
again. He and management agreed last spring to go separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   In their first season without KJ, the Suns have struggled. With
only nine games left in regular-season, they are only one game
above .500. KJ has watched from afar.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could I not?'' said KJ, who continues to work with
underprivileged kids. ``This team was such a big part of my life
for so long. There are a lot different players and pieces. But it's
happening. They'll be all right.
</P>
<P>
   KJ, who was accompanied by former Philadelphia 76ers great and
current Orlando executive Julius Erving, said ``I miss teammates I
miss the fans. This has been my life since I was 13-14 years old.
You know, 20 years. There's nothing like NBA basketball. That was a
great period. I appreciate what I had.'' &QL;

CHAMBERS ASCENDS TO RING OF HONOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Suns unveiled their new Ring of Honor in America
West Arena's upper deck of the south end, and inducted forward  &UR; Tom
Chambers on Sunday at halftime of the Suns' 99-93 defeat of the
Seattle Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Suns President  &UR; Jerry Colangelo also gave Chambers a new
Chevrolet pickup, a horse and a custom saddle.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers joins  &UR; Connie Hawkins, Dick Van Arsdale, Alvan Adams,
Paul Westphal and &UR; Walter Davis on the ring. Westphal was in
attendance, as coach of the Sonics, and got the loudest ovation
from the crowd when the previous honorees were introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans were really nice, and I appreciated that,'' said
Westphal, who gave the crowd a wave during the ovation as he
conducted a timeout. ``I hope I acknowledged (them) satisfactorily.
I have a lot of great memories here.''
</P>
<P>
   The only previous honoree who was not in attendance was Hawkins,
who is with an NBA contingent that is visiting American troops
stationed in Bosnia, Croatia and other areas of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he'd rather be here,'' Chambers quipped. &QL; 
Where's the volume? &QL; 
Suns Coach  &UR; Danny Ainge seemed mystified by the muted response from
announced sellout crowd at America West. The noise level was no
greater than the Suns used to get during some exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a lot of excitement,'' he said. ``It wasn't even
close to as loud as it was when we were up in Seattle, and they've
got about the same record we do and they're struggling right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys realize we had a slow start, and we deserved to get
booed earlier in the year. But they're playing well right now, and
these are big games. Let's get some volume.'' &QL; 
Olympic sample &QL; 
Never mind the pressure of hitting a game-winning shot.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jason Kidd and  &UR; Tom Gugliotta learned what real pressure is.
After the game, they were asked by U.S. Olympic officials to
provide a urine sample for a mandatory drug test that all players
who will compete at the Olympic qualifying tournament in Puerto
Rico this summer must take.
</P>
<P>
   After a 2-hour, 20-minute basketball game, both were a little
dehydrated.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after the game, Gugliotta and Kidd were still guzzling
bottled water and dipping their toes in the team's hot tub. Results
were pending. &QL; 
Selected short subjects &QL; 
The Suns moved above the .500 mark for the first time since March
24. And they improved to one game over .500 on their home court for
the first time since Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   The club swept Seattle in three games. It's the first time in
franchise history Phoenix has swept the Sonics, but there will be
an asterisk because of the shortened season.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's  &UR; Don MacLean had scored only 21 points all season. He
had 16 against the Suns, but also surrendered a wide-open shot to
Gugliotta late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns have not allowed an opponent to score 100 points in 14
consecutive games, a franchise record.

BOOK LOVERS SEEK TO FILL SHELVES OF INDIAN RESERVATION'S LIBRARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BETTY BEARD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GILA RIVER COMMUNITY, Ariz. _ One January day, journalist Claude
Jackson was in the Gila River Indian Community's only public
library and decided to look for his favorite author.
</P>
<P>
   A 26-year-old Pima Indian, reporter for the ``Gila River Indian
Newspaper'' and English literature graduate of Arizona State
University, Jackson likes to read a few passages in his spare time
from the Bard of Avon.
</P>
<P>
   To his dismay, the Sacaton library's only William Shakespeare
offering was a copy of ``King Lear''.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare isn't the only thing the Ira Hayes Memorial Library
is missing. It's missing most of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The library's only globe shows the Soviet Union, which crumbled
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``World Book'' encyclopedias are from 1988, the big dictionary
is the 1986 version of ``Webster's Third New International,'' and
the Funk &AMP; Wagnall's ``New'' ``Encyclopedia of Science'' is dated
1986.
</P>
<P>
   Some reference books are ancient, such as the yellowed but
charming ``Little'' ``Journeys'' series of biographies from 1928.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no new atlases. I'm afraid to look at them to see how
old they are,'' said librarian Elaine Stephens, a former school
librarian who began working at Ira Hayes in August.
</P>
<P>
   The Hayes library, founded in 1985 by the Sun Lakes Kiwanis
Club, is the only public library in the sprawling 620-square-mile
Gila River Indian Community. Many patrons drive 30 minutes to check
out a book.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 2,500 to 3,000 books are old, Stephens said. The
library is especially short on books about Native American culture,
arts and crafts, space travel and modern fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Kids ask for the popular Goosebump books or other scary stories,
but the library has none. Adults ask for Tony Hillerman mysteries,
but there are only three.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its shortcomings, Stephens said, the library has
survived in the poor Native American community south of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens credits former librarian Eleanor Pasqual Whittier, now
in her late 60s, with the library's tenacity. ``She had no
training. She wanted to keep the library open and learned on the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Whittier, who has retired, couldn't be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``The library is kind of a forgotten entity. We're getting new
people, but a lot of them are the old faithful. . . . There's still
people who don't know about the library,'' Stephens said.
</P>
<P>
   Like any other library, the Ira Hayes Library loses books to
borrowers who never return them. Stephens finally began listing
their names in the ``Gila'' ``River Indian Newspaper,'' but said it
hasn't done any good.
</P>
<P>
   But just when things seem bleak, something happens to cheer her
up. One day a little girl with an overdue book explained that her
uncle's dog had chewed it up. She offered to pay for it and brought
in a penny bank full of coins. Stephens only had the heart to
charge her $2.
</P>
<P>
   She also gets reference questions about the Pima and Maricopa
Indians who live on the community. Her oddest query was ``What did
your tribe do for Christmas before they became Christians?''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the community has casino revenue, the library is slowly
improving. It has three new Dell computers, although they have yet
to be hooked up, because the phone lines need to be upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling money has also increased book-buying power, with the
library's book budget at $3,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   There's even talk of building a library to replace this one,
housed in a 1920s former Bureau of Indian Affairs office, a blue
schoolhouse with plastic glass windows and a touch-and-go
air-conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Jackson is spearheading a library book drive,
one he began with $40 from his wallet to buy a copy of the
``Complete Works of William'' ``Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson then contacted a former teacher, Laura Tohe, a Navajo
poet and assistant English professor at ASU, and asked for a list
of suggested Native American children's books to someday buy.
</P>
<P>
   Tohe was sympathetic without ever having visited the library.
After all, she grew up on a Navajo reservation and eventually
became a writer and poet and earned a Ph.D. in English.
</P>
<P>
   She contacted other Native American writers, and within weeks,
the library received about 40 books, mostly from Native American
writers. Donors included an African-American woman who remembered
dismal segregated libraries from her childhood, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Tohe also contacted a Barnes &AMP; Noble Booksellers store in
Ahwatukee Foothills and persuaded the store to collect books for
the library. The store is offering a 20 percent discount for any
book bought into the store for the library through April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It totally caught me off guard. All I wanted to do was donate
one book,'' said Jackson, who grew up in Phoenix and is just
beginning to learn about the reservation and his cultural history.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the donations, the library still has no copy of Dee
Brown's ``Bury My'' ``Heart at Wounded Knee,'' the 1971 classic
told from a Native American perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Native Americans) are much more interested in their
culture than the ordinary person,'' she said. Pimas come in often
to ask what houses looked like in the old days, what people ate or
how they dressed. ``Stories written by old-timers are impossible to
keep on the shelves,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The library is named after the late Ira Hayes, a Pima who became
famous after his picture was taken with four other Marines and a
Navy corpsman raising the flag at Iwo Jima in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Photographer Joe Rosenthal won a Pulitzer Prize for the World
War II photo and Hayes became a reluctant hero. He died in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the challenges, Stephens said, she's wanted this job a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started I knew it was not going to be easy. I told
myself, `I want to make this the best library I can and let people
know it's here.' I want it to be for the people, where they can be
comfortable and where it reflects their different interests.''
</P>
<P>
   She wants others to share her main passion in life: ``Books are
my life, although some people say they're a poor substitute for
life.'' &QL;  Betty

ROENICK EXHIBITS TOUGHNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS AND BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Coyotes center  &UR; Jeremy Roenick said the simultaneous
slash that broke his thumb and hit by Dallas defenseman &UR; Derian
Hatcher that broke his jaw in three places and resulted in a
probable loss of eight teeth happened so fast Wednesday that it was
a blur.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I did was feel my jaw and wiggled my hand a
little,'' Roenick said. ``Everything happened so fast, I got
slashed (by  &UR; Craig Ludwig) and hit, and I didn't know whether to go
to the bench and cry, or go to the referee and say, `Look at my
jaw,' and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Lost amid the confusion was the fact that Roenick did return to
the game and played a shift on a five-on-three power play and
tossed a perfect pass to
 &UR; Keith Tkachuk for a shot at a wide-open net, but the puck hopped
over Tkachuk's stick on the terrible ice surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out there and got hit a little bit and my whole jaw
jiggled, so I thought something must really be wrong, so I went
back to the bench,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes Coach &UR; Jim Schoenfeld said Roenick's to return to the ice
``with his lips flapping all over the place'' is why nobody should
ever question his toughness, competitiveness or fortitude.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick, who attended final regular-season game against Dallas
after undergoing 5{ hours of surgery to repair his jaw on Thursday,
said Saturday was his most painful day since the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been the toughest so far,'' said Roenick, who has been
given a supply of bean and potato soups by his favorite local
restaurant. ``With all the drugs and Novocain, it was a little
easier to get through yesterday. When I woke up today, I was sore
and I was hurting, but I still looked forward to coming to the
game.'' &QL; 
What's going on? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He played a key role in helping the New York Rangers win the
Stanley Cup in 1994, but after the Coyotes rescued him from the
minor leagues late this season, right wing  &UR; Brian Noonan has mostly
sat as a healthy scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Acquired while the team was ravaged with injuries to its
forwards, there has been little room for ice time now that the club
is mostly injury-free. Does he expect his role to change in the
playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, sometimes I have feelings since I've
been here that I really don't know what's going on,'' said Noonan,
who has 275 points in 629 career NHL games. ``The guys who have
been here all year are going to get their chance to play, but
sometimes, just sitting around, you wonder what their plans are for
you.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been frustrating, but I've got to stay positive. I want
to be playing, but I'm not the type of guy who's going to barge
into the room and demand to play. At the same time, that doesn't
mean I'm content with just sitting out. I'd like to play, I feel I
can help, but I'm just going to have to wait my return and see how
things unfold.''
</P>
<P>
   Noonan's experience could be his greatest asset. But it likely
will take an injury for Schoenfeld to use him in the upcoming
playoff series against the St. Louis Blues, which begins with Games
1 and 2 Thursday and Saturday at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld threw Noonan a bone on Saturday, letting him suit up
for the Coyotes' regular-season finale. &QL; 
Ending the drought &QL; 
It took 31 games and more than seven months, but winger  &UR; Stephen
Leach finally scored his first goal of the season with a
third-period shot Saturday that helped the Coyotes defeat the
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good,'' Leach said. ``Certainly, it's tough when you
keep looking at the stat sheets and you've got a big goose egg
there. It was good to get it off. Hopefully, I can pop one in here
and there, and I think the third- and fourth-line guys, hopefully,
can do that throughout the playoffs. That's an important part of a
team's success.''
</P>
<P>
   Leach began the season with Ottawa, was waived, and the Coyotes
signed him as a free agent on Dec. 3.

2 PLAYERS SAVOR RARE STARTS

<P>
   PHOENIX - Given baseball players' competitive nature, it is
doubtful they will ask the manager for a breather. So the manager
often walks a fine line in determining when that should occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to get to know the guys enough to get a sense
for when it's good for them,'' Diamondbacks Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, a change is as much of a benefit for the player being
put into the lineup as it is for the man being removed. A good
example of that came Saturday, when  &UR; Dante Powell replaced  &UR; Steve
Finley in center field, and Sunday, when  &UR; David Dellucci spelled
 &UR; Tony Womack in right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Steve to take advantage of it because you never know,
it may not happen again for a while,'' said Showalter, who had
Finley back in the lineup Sunday and batting leadoff. ``You know,
though, that these guys will need a day off at some point and you
need the other guys to stay fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dellucci, who made his first start of the season on Sunday:
``Nothing has changed. I want to try to do the same thing I did
during the spring: put the ball in play and play solid defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Dellucci had a double in four trips to the plate, walked once
and scored two runs. &QL; 
Stinnett sits 1 more &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Catcher  &UR; Kelly Stinnett was ready to resume his duties behind
the plate Sunday, but there still was uncertainty about his running
because of a bruised left quadriceps. Showalter was cautious and
decided to not start him until the tonight's first game of a
three-game series against the Philadelphia Phillies at Bank One
Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long recovery period, but he's at the point where
he needs to be,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Stinnett has been participating in pre-game defensive drills in
full gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do those drills until you're blue in the face but
they're only beneficial to a point,'' Showalter said. ``It's like a
pitcher throwing on the side. It's a different level of play in a
game situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Stinnett admitted he isn't quite 100 percent to run full speed,
but he could get behind the plate. Was he anxious, or was it better
to rest one more day?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit of both,'' Stinnett said.  &UR; ``Damian
( &UR; Miller, the second Arizona catcher) has done a good job (he has
started each of the nine games since Stinnett's injury), but he
needs a breather, too.'' &QL; 
Where's Barry? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a .647 average (11 for 17), two home runs and nine walks
against Diamondbacks right-hander  &UR; Armando Reynoso, it seemed
strange that Giants left fielder  &UR; Barry Bonds would not be in the
lineup on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There was a reason. Bonds was out because soreness in his left
arm prevented him from getting off a strong throw or getting the
proper extension on his swing. &QL;

TRADE EARNS REDSKINS TOP GRADE

<TEXT>
<P>
   New Orleans Saints Coach Mike Ditka showed up in dreadlocks
Sunday and then promised teams would dread playing against Texas
running back Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to the Super Bowl,'' Ditka said. ``We got the
final piece of the puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   Saints fans better enjoy Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner who
wears his hair in dreadlocks. He cost them the rest of this year's
draft and two high picks next year in a trade with Washington,
which is why they get a grade of B, for bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the NFL think Ditka has lost in his mind in making the
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Williams isn't one of them, but he acknowledged that he thought
Ditka was ``crazy'' for wearing the dreadlocks wig.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm jealous,'' Williams said. ``It's longer than mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the rest of the draft grades:
</P>
<P>
   NFC East
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Redskins _ Champ Bailey with the seventh pick overall? It's one
of the all-time steals. Three No. 1 picks next year is unheard of.
Grade: A+.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cardinals _ Here's what ``Sports Illustrated's'' Peter King
wrote about their draft: ``I think you can't underestimate what a
good job Arizona did in the first round. To get two starting
players _ Ohio State wide receiver David Boston and tackle L.J.
Shelton _ in one draft is rare. Grade: A-.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cowboys _ They had to find a replacement for Leon Lett, and
North Carolina's Ebenezer Ekuban has a chance to be the guy. Grade:
B.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Eagles _ Former option quarterbacks shouldn't be taken second
overall. It's understandable that Eagles fans booed. Grade: C+.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Giants _ Second-round pick Joe Montgomery was just a part-time
starter and damaged goods. Grade: D+.
</P>
<P>
   NFC Central
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bears _ They wanted UCLA quarterback Cade McNown and got him
and five extra picks. Brilliance and Bears haven't been mentioned
in the same sentence in years. Grade: A.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lions _ Getting Southern California middle linebacker Chris
Claiborne ninth overall was a gift from the heavens. Grade: A-.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Buccaneers _ Lining up Louisiana State defensive tackle Anthony
McFarland next to Warren Sapp will be scary for offenses. Grade:
B+.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Packers _ Filled pressing needs in the secondary by saturating
the position. Grade: B.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Vikings _ How do you draft a player (Michigan State's Dimitrius
Underwood) in the first round who didn't play last year because of
discipline reasons? Grade: C-.
</P>
<P>
   NFC West
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rams _ The Rams might not have a quarterback, but they have
weapons in North Carolina State wide receiver Torry Holt and
running back Marshall Faulk, acquired from Indianapolis. Grade: A.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Falcons _ They ruined a good draft by trading away next year's
No. 1. Grade: B.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Saints _ Never before has a team had only one pick in a draft.
They could have gone fishing Sunday. Grade: B.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Panthers _ They sat out the first round but rebounded nicely
with Georgia offensive tackle Chris Terry. Grade: C+.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 49ers _ Bill Walsh said he would take a quarterback and didn't.
That wasn't genius-like. Grade: C.
</P>
<P>
   AFC East
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bills _ As always, they made few draft mistakes and filled
needs, especially at cornerback with Ohio State's Antoine
Wingfield. Grade: B+.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dolphins _ How many running backs can play at the same time?
Grade: B.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Patriots _ They wanted Miami running back Edgerrin James and
settled for LSU's Kevin Faulk in the second round. Grade: B-.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Colts _ James might turn out to be a good player, but he wasn't
worth the third pick in the draft. Rebounded nicely in later
rounds. Grade: B-.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jets _ Only the diehard Jets fans can get excited about getting
guards. Grade: C-.
</P>
<P>
   AFC Central &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Browns _ They didn't fill a need at running back but addressed
all others, and most picks were solid. They got first-round value
in getting Syracuse wide receiver Kevin Johnson. Grade: A-.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jaguars _ Defensive help is on its way, but it might not be
enough to catch Denver. Grade: B+.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ravens _ They fell in love with University of Arizona players,
and rightfully so. Chris McAlister will upgrade their secondary
tremendously. Grade: B.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Steelers _ Wide receiver Troy Edwards was a stretch at 13, but
he filled their top need. Grade: B-.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bengals _ Akili Smith might be the best of the quarterbacks
taken at the top of the draft. Reached for players later. Grade:
B-.
</P>
<P>
   AFC West
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Seahawks _ Mike Holmgren did his best Jimmy Johnson imitation
by trading down, and it worked. Love the pick of Washington
quarterback Brock Huard in the third round. Grade: A-.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chiefs _ To get the best offensive tackle in the draft with the
14th pick is more than just luck. Grade: A-.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Broncos _ What does a team that has almost everything need?
Depth, and the Broncos got it. Solid but not flashy. Grade: B-.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Raiders _ They must be trying to stockpile offensive tackles.
Grade: C.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chargers _ School of choice goes from South Carolina State to
South Dakota State. Grade: C-.

GERMAINE NOT SURPRISED AT BEING DRAFTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After years of ``people telling me no,'' someone finally said
``yes'' to Joe Germaine.
</P>
<P>
   That someone was St. Louis Coach Dick Vermeil, who called the
former Mesa Mountain View High School standout at home Sunday and
told him he was about to be drafted by the Rams. The 6-1, 200-pound
quarterback from Ohio State was the sixth pick in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, it's not mind-boggling,'' Germaine
said. ``I've dreamed about being an NFL quarterback ever since I
started playing Pop Warner. I've played the scenario over and over
in my mind. I guess I just expected it.''
</P>
<P>
   Also drafted Sunday were Arizona offensive linemen Edwin
Mulitalo, who went to Baltimore in the fourth round, and Yusuf
Scott, who was selected by the Cardinals in the fifth. Wildcats
tight end Mike Lucky went to Dallas in the seventh round.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State was shut out on the second day of the draft after
two players _ center Grey Ruegamer and fullback Jeff Paulk _ were
taken Saturday. The Sun Devils had 13 players selected in the two
previous seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Several area players signed free-agent contracts, including ASU
wide receivers Kenny Mitchell (Washington Redskins) and Lenzie
Jackson (Jacksonville Jaguars) and Arizona tight end Paul Shields
(Baltimore Ravens).
</P>
<P>
   Germaine finds himself in an encouraging scenario in St. Louis,
which signed 28-year-old Trent Green to a contract in the
off-season. Although Green is the man of the moment, he is not
perceived to be the Rams' quarterback of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Germaine is used to the underdog role. After playing on a
run-oriented offense in high school, he wasn't exactly bombarded
with Division I scholarship offers, he said. ASU liked him, but as
a defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback was his love, so he opted to play at Scottsdale
Community College before accepting a scholarship at Ohio State,
where he platooned much of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fortunate with the success I've had,'' Germaine
said. ``I guess I've just been determined. A lot of people have
told me `no' during my career.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing from Vermeil, Germaine headed to a Valley mall to
buy as many Rams hats as he could find for his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could only track down three,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mulitalo, who spent two years on a Mormon mission before playing
his junior and senior seasons at Arizona, goes to a Baltimore team
that lost two offensive linemen _ Wally Williams and Orlando Brown
_ to free agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons had several needs to address, including fullback,
which is good news for Paulk. Atlanta's starter, Bob Christian,
went down with a knee injury on Dec. 13 and is still not fully
healed.
</P>
<P>
   Paulk wasn't expecting to get drafted on Saturday, so he was
surprised when the phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden (Coach) Dan Reeves calls me up, and it took me
a while to even realize what was going on,'' Paulk said. ``He said,
`Can you play special teams, son?' and I said, `Whatever you need.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Paulk, a standout at Tempe Corona del Sol, made the most of his
ability to block at ASU. He has played a key role in the success of
the Sun Devils' running game during the last few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stay at ASU was great,'' he said. ``Coming up out of high
school, I never thought I'd be in this position.''

SCOTT GOES HOG WILD AFTER SELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Please keep this a secret, but Arizona offensive
guard Yusuf Scott celebrated being picked in the fifth round by the
Cardinals by feasting on barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell Coach (Vince) Tobin, but I've got a lot of ribs in
my sink,'' Scott said from Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin heard the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's lean meat,'' Tobin said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who has battled a weight problem, was in a partying mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' he said of being picked by the Cardinals. ``My
fiancee (UA point guard Lisa Griffith) loves it. The Cardinals were
my No. 1 team. I wanted to be close to my fiancee and family, and
you can't beat the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who turned pro after his junior season, is so excited
about joining the Cardinals that he plans to come to the team's
Tempe training facility today.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would gain weight if the coaches asked him to or shed
a few pounds if requested. He weighed 330 pounds last season and
now weighs 320.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they need me to gain weight, I can easily go to
McDonald's,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ferguson, vice president-player personnel, described Scott
as ``Nate Newtonish,'' referring to the longtime Dallas Cowboys
offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, he'll be that good, not that fat,'' Ferguson said,
smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Scott not only was one of the Wildcats' most popular players, he
also was one of the most effective. He was voted the Pac-10's best
lineman in a vote by opposing defensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just powerful,'' Ferguson said. ``On the highlight film,
you see him chasing an Oregon linebacker down the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like drafting tackles and making them into guards. He's an
exception. He's a guard. But I like what he brings. I like his
size. I like his attitude and temperament.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott took pride in making so many crushing, pancake blocks, he
ate pancakes for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tough guy,'' Cardinals offensive line coach George
Warhop said. ``He finishes everything. I saw the tape of the Iowa
game. He got on a linebacker and took him out of the picture frame
and off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Warhop plans on using Scott at both the right and left guard
spots, where he will back up Lester Holmes and Chris Dishman,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason Scott still was available in the fifth round was
because of his disappointing performance at the NFL's scouting
combine in February in Indianapolis. He was bothered by a pulled
Achilles' tendon and a sore left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   UA Coach Dick Tomey said Scott, like many big guys, might always
battle his weight, but that ``the thing I admire about him the most
is his work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cardinals asked about his personality,'' Tomey said. ``He
has a very outgoing personality. He's very affable and
enthusiastic. He's a joy to coach and be around.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott is looking forward to being around Cardinals quarterback
Jake Plummer, formerly a rival at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a winner, regardless if he's a Sun Devil,'' Scott said.
``He gets in offensive linemen's faces. If he sees a wide receiver
isn't open, he lowers his shoulder pads and gets those yards on his
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I'm going to do when I see him is go up to him
and shake his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott said he also planned to have a friendly bet with Plummer
on next year's UA-ASU game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll bet dinner, and I'm going to (remind) him I can eat,''
he said.

NEW QB FAMILIAR WITH TOBIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 and LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Rookie quarterback  &UR; Chris Greisen doesn't need
any biographical information on Cardinals Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a legend (around here),'' said Greisen, a seventh-round
draft pick from Northwest Missouri State. ``You say the Tobin name,
and everyone knows him and his brother (former NFL executive
Bill).''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Tobins played for Maryville High School, home
of the Spoofhounds. Maryville also is the site of Northwest
Missouri State.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, who grew up in nearby Burlington Junction, Mo., has a
charity golf tournament each summer in Maryville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years ago, Northwest Missouri was 0-11,'' Tobin said of
the Division II school. ``They were 15-1 in 1997. They were 16-0
this year and won the national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Division II national championship game, Greisen,
pronounced ``Gry-zun,'' threw five touchdown passes, including a
74-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   Yet because he played at a small school, he wasn't expected to
be drafted. In fact, Baltimore, Cincinnati and San Francisco called
him during the draft and asked him about signing as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the Cardinals drafted him was a year ago, they hoped
to sign Colorado State's  &UR; Moses Moreno as a free agent and bypassed
him in the seventh round. The Chicago Bears then drafted Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   Greisen has an excellent chance of making the Cardinals. They
have only three quarterbacks on their roster and will carry three
all season.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to face some competition for the No. 3 job after
the team signs a rookie free agent at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my strength is my ability to make plays, kind of like
 &UR; Jake
 &UR; Plummer, and just being smart out there,'' said Greisen, 6 feet 2,
223 pounds, who was a Division I recruit in high school out of
Sturgeon Bay, Wisc., until he suffered a knee injury his senior
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a knack for the game, just instinctive things.
A weakness might be speed, but quarterbacks really don't need great
overall speed.'' &QL; 
Popular analyst
</P>
<P>
   While the national analysts were gushing over the Cardinals'
picks, none was more astute than a neophyte to the business.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive back  &UR; Corey Chavous, a rookie last season, was crisp
and sharp in his assessment of the team's draft during a two-day
draft stint on a national radio show.
</P>
<P>
   He was so impressive in his national broadcasting debut, ESPN
also asked him to evaluate the draft during their telecast.
</P>
<P>
   Chavous, a draftnik who has a videotape library on 400 players,
told ESPN that cornerback  &UR; Jacoby Rhinehart, a sixth-round pick
from Southern Methodist, was the ``Senior Bowl South Team Most
Valuable Player'' and had ``15 pass break-ups last season.''
</P>
<P>
   But he really opened some eyes when he proclaimed Arizona
cornerback

BOOK LOVERS SEEK TO FILL SHELVES OF INDIAN RESERVATION'S LIBRARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BETTY BEARD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GILA RIVER COMMUNITY, Ariz. _ One January day, journalist Claude
Jackson was in the Gila River Indian Community's only public
library and decided to look for his favorite author.
</P>
<P>
   A 26-year-old Pima Indian, reporter for the ``Gila River Indian
Newspaper'' and English literature graduate of Arizona State
University, Jackson likes to read a few passages in his spare time
from the Bard of Avon.
</P>
<P>
   To his dismay, the Sacaton library's only William Shakespeare
offering was a copy of ``King Lear''.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare isn't the only thing the Ira Hayes Memorial Library
is missing. It's missing most of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The library's only globe shows the Soviet Union, which crumbled
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``World Book'' encyclopedias are from 1988, the big dictionary
is the 1986 version of ``Webster's Third New International,'' and
the Funk &AMP; Wagnall's ``New'' ``Encyclopedia of Science'' is dated
1986.
</P>
<P>
   Some reference books are ancient, such as the yellowed but
charming ``Little'' ``Journeys'' series of biographies from 1928.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no new atlases. I'm afraid to look at them to see how
old they are,'' said librarian Elaine Stephens, a former school
librarian who began working at Ira Hayes in August.
</P>
<P>
   The Hayes library, founded in 1985 by the Sun Lakes Kiwanis
Club, is the only public library in the sprawling 620-square-mile
Gila River Indian Community. Many patrons drive 30 minutes to check
out a book.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 2,500 to 3,000 books are old, Stephens said. The
library is especially short on books about Native American culture,
arts and crafts, space travel and modern fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Kids ask for the popular Goosebump books or other scary stories,
but the library has none. Adults ask for Tony Hillerman mysteries,
but there are only three.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its shortcomings, Stephens said, the library has
survived in the poor Native American community south of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens credits former librarian Eleanor Pasqual Whittier, now
in her late 60s, with the library's tenacity. ``She had no
training. She wanted to keep the library open and learned on the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Whittier, who has retired, couldn't be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``The library is kind of a forgotten entity. We're getting new
people, but a lot of them are the old faithful. . . . There's still
people who don't know about the library,'' Stephens said.
</P>
<P>
   Like any other library, the Ira Hayes Library loses books to
borrowers who never return them. Stephens finally began listing
their names in the ``Gila'' ``River Indian Newspaper,'' but said it
hasn't done any good.
</P>
<P>
   But just when things seem bleak, something happens to cheer her
up. One day a little girl with an overdue book explained that her
uncle's dog had chewed it up. She offered to pay for it and brought
in a penny bank full of coins. Stephens only had the heart to
charge her $2.
</P>
<P>
   She also gets reference questions about the Pima and Maricopa
Indians who live on the community. Her oddest query was ``What did
your tribe do for Christmas before they became Christians?''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the community has casino revenue, the library is slowly
improving. It has three new Dell computers, although they have yet
to be hooked up, because the phone lines need to be upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling money has also increased book-buying power, with the
library's book budget at $3,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   There's even talk of building a library to replace this one,
housed in a 1920s former Bureau of Indian Affairs office, a blue
schoolhouse with plastic glass windows and a touch-and-go
air-conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Jackson is spearheading a library book drive,
one he began with $40 from his wallet to buy a copy of the
``Complete Works of William'' ``Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson then contacted a former teacher, Laura Tohe, a Navajo
poet and assistant English professor at ASU, and asked for a list
of suggested Native American children's books to someday buy.
</P>
<P>
   Tohe was sympathetic without ever having visited the library.
After all, she grew up on a Navajo reservation and eventually
became a writer and poet and earned a Ph.D. in English.
</P>
<P>
   She contacted other Native American writers, and within weeks,
the library received about 40 books, mostly from Native American
writers. Donors included an African-American woman who remembered
dismal segregated libraries from her childhood, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Tohe also contacted a Barnes &AMP; Noble Booksellers store in
Ahwatukee Foothills and persuaded the store to collect books for
the library. The store is offering a 20 percent discount for any
book bought into the store for the library through April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It totally caught me off guard. All I wanted to do was donate
one book,'' said Jackson, who grew up in Phoenix and is just
beginning to learn about the reservation and his cultural history.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the donations, the library still has no copy of Dee
Brown's ``Bury My'' ``Heart at Wounded Knee,'' the 1971 classic
told from a Native American perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Native Americans) are much more interested in their
culture than the ordinary person,'' she said. Pimas come in often
to ask what houses looked like in the old days, what people ate or
how they dressed. ``Stories written by old-timers are impossible to
keep on the shelves,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The library is named after the late Ira Hayes, a Pima who became
famous after his picture was taken with four other Marines and a
Navy corpsman raising the flag at Iwo Jima in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Photographer Joe Rosenthal won a Pulitzer Prize for the World
War II photo and Hayes became a reluctant hero. He died in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the challenges, Stephens said, she's wanted this job a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started I knew it was not going to be easy. I told
myself, `I want to make this the best library I can and let people
know it's here.' I want it to be for the people, where they can be
comfortable and where it reflects their different interests.''
</P>
<P>
   She wants others to share her main passion in life: ``Books are
my life, although some people say they're a poor substitute for
life.'' &QL;  Betty

ABDUL CASTS A SPELL AS ONE SHARP KID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're interviewing the state's best speller, you might as
well ask him to tackle some tough words.
</P>
<P>
   Some might think the request a bit rude, putting him on the spot
like that. But to his credit, Abdul Kahsai showed none of the
reluctance of a doctor at a cocktail party who balks at listening
to someone drone on about an ingrown toenail. The 12-year-old
seventh-grader at Taylor Junior High School in Mesa jumped right in
and clicked off ``pestiferous'' (CQ) and ``diagenesis'' (CQ)
without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, since he won the state spelling bee April 10, this was
nothing that all his classmates haven't been asking of him every
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just ask Abdul,'' Andy Flambouras, one of Abdul's teachers,
said. ``He's our built-in dictionary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my job,'' Abdul said with justifiable pride and a grin.
``I'm the state spelling-bee champion.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a good sport, Abdul. Monstrously hard-working and
competitive as all get-out, but a good sport nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say he's perfect. He faltered a bit on
``chrysanthemum'' and ``meprobamate'' (CQ) in our impromptu session
(blame the dubious pronunciations of his inquisitor). But if his
work habits hold true, he won't misspell them again.
</P>
<P>
   TOUGH DAD, SADISTIC JOE
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Abdul lost at the district level. Missed
``etiquette.'' Still pains him, you can tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so disappointed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So much so that he has studied lists of words every day since
the middle of December. Not just looked them over, studied them,
all 150 words per page.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was to miss just one word, my dad would make me go back
and study the whole page'' again, Abdul said last week in
Flambouras' classroom. ``The second (miss), he made me look up the
definitions. The third time, he made me write a sentence with (the
word) in it.''
</P>
<P>
   There weren't many third times. Or, for that matter, seconds.
Just ask Joe Halcomb. The 13-year-old Joe, Abdul's self-described
spelling coach, tagged along with Abdul for an interview and
revealed his methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I helped him by reading the words, and he spelled them out,''
Joe explained. Sounds simple. Deceptively so. Joe also had a
punishment worked out: Every time Abdul missed a word, he owed Joe
10 push-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ONLY ONE PROBLEM
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't missed any yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Joe's career as a sadistic and demanding coach is getting
off to a slow start. On the bright side, all the work is helping
Joe, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm starting to get used to all these big words,'' he
said. &QL; 
ABDUL GOES TO WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his study habits, Abdul buzzed through ``nyctalopia,''
``lobscouse''and ``prosateur'' (CQ) in the state bee.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's getting ready for the national bee in Washington, D.C.,
in June. He and Joe will continue their work. Meanwhile, Abdul
answered the question I've always had about good spellers: Does he
see the word in his mind and just spell what he sees? Or does he go
by spelling rules?
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to sound it out phonetically,'' he said. ``Then it comes
out into my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   As you can see, Abdul is adept at answering dumb questions. He
should be. He's been on television and been interviewed by
newspapers. He's even had a scheduled appearance on a local morning
show rescheduled at the last minute _ by now, he's an old pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``People I never knew before come up to me and say, `Hey, you're
the spelling-bee man,' '' Abdul said. Does that include girls?
</P>
<P>
   Huge blush.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's getting a little bit too personal there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. But his embarrassment pointed out what a normal, cool _
if extremely smart _ kid Abdul is. He likes basketball, swimming,
rap, hip-hop, video games _ all the things 12-year-olds do.
</P>
<P>
   Since there is no market for professional spellers, Abdul
already has started thinking about career plans. He wants to be a
basketball player. And if that doesn't work out?
</P>
<P>
   ``A journalist.''
</P>
<P>
   Told you he was smart. &QL;

   JEROME, Ariz. _ Like a fortress atop Cleopatra Hill, this relic
mining-company hospital sat empty for 45 years before it was
brought back to life in 1996 as the Jerome Grand Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But the hotel's owners pulled the plug in January and the 1926
landmark is back on life support, awaiting an April 30 auction that
could lure a new owner and another revival.
</P>
<P>
   Potential buyers will have to consider the viability of the
hotel, which was in business just 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Although hundreds of tourists visit Jerome's historic hillside
galleries, cafes and taverns each day, most of them are gone by
sundown, winding their way down the ``Hogback'' on the highway to
Clarkdale.
</P>
<P>
   The five-story hotel is perched above the main business
district, nearly a mile above sea level and accessible only by
steep and narrow Hill Street.
</P>
<P>
   Occupancy at the Jerome Grand averaged about 50 percent, and the
restaurant and lounge drew people from all over the Verde Valley
and Sedona. Rates for the hotel's 20 rooms ranged from $70 to $170
per night.
</P>
<P>
   The Altherr family, which bought the presumably haunted property
in 1994, was much better at converting it into a hotel than it was
at running a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was burning us out managing it,'' Larry Altherr said.
</P>
<P>
   Auctioneer John Weaver of Southwest Real Estate Auctioneers said
bidding for the one-of-a-kind property probably will start around
$2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Altherr said Phelps Dodge was asking $670,000 for the property
in 1994, and his family invested about $1 million in improvements.
</P>
<P>
   When they took over the place, Altherr and his brother, Bob,
tinkered like mad scientists with the electrical control panel to
restart the 70-year-old Otis elevator, which has an accordion door.
They also fired up the original Kewannee steam boiler and switched
the lights on for the first time in 44 years.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a sight when the hospital on the hill beamed with
light, Larry Altherr said.
</P>
<P>
   A tour reveals that the hospital-turned-hotel has survived the
ravages of time with remarkable grace, save for some leaky windows
and drainpipes. Two-thirds of the 32 rooms have been restored.
</P>
<P>
   The Altherrs, Phoenix natives with a background in construction
and restoration, maintained the architectural integrity of the
Spanish mission-style building while transforming it from its
institutional roots into an interesting historic inn.
</P>
<P>
   Some townsfolk say there was friction between the town and the
Altherrs, particularly over some excavation on the property.
</P>
<P>
   But Mayor Jay Kinsella said the hotel was an asset to Jerome and
he'd like to see another owner have a go at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's all lit up at night, it's absolutely beautiful,''
Kinsella said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Verde Mining Co. hospital was built during Jerome's
lucrative mining era, when the population soared to 15,000. The
30,000-square-foot hospital was a modern marvel, with one of the
state's first self-service elevators. Phelps Dodge bought United
Verde in 1935 and operated the hospital until 1950, three years
before the company shut the mines. Phelps Dodge maintained the
hospital in working order until 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome, 110 miles north of Phoenix on the steep slope of Mingus
Mountain, dwindled to a ghost of its billion-dollar boomtown past,
when miners blew their pay in casinos, bars and bawdy houses.
</P>
<P>
   The population dwindled to a few hundred before a renaissance
began in the 1960s. Jerome, celebrating its centennial this year,
now has about 475 residents.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's haunted reputation mushroomed from its long
dormancy and tales of mysterious deaths and ghosts. Jerome, after
all, is a ghost town.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their initiation, fraternity pledges from Northern
Arizona University sometimes were forced to sneak into the old
hospital and spend the night, Kinsella says.
</P>
<P>
   A science-fiction cable television program called ``Insights''
brought up a crew and a clairvoyant to explore the hospital's
mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Among the deaths at the United Verde Hospital was a terminally
ill mining company superintendent who shot himself, a caretaker who
hanged himself and a hospital maintenance man, Claude Harvey, who
was found dead at the bottom of the elevator shaft in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   An inquest was inconclusive, but Altherr said he believes that
Harvey simply had a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   He has seen some mysterious things _ doors swinging open
inexplicably and the old call lights for the nurses going on when
nobody was around to activate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a deal with the ghost,'' Altherr said, half-seriously.
``I said, `You don't pay rent and you don't hold a paintbrush;
don't bother me and I won't bother you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Not all memories of the United Verde Hospital are so dark.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Schrader was born there in 1929. Her father, John Oscar
Mullen, was school superintendent in Jerome for 40 years and she
lived in the town until 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the hospital a couple of times,'' she recalled. ``At
about age 6, they thought I had appendicitis, but it turned out I
probably just ate too many peanut butter cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, she hit an iron pole in a sledding accident
and woke up in the hospital. Her left side was paralyzed for about
six months.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader, now a Tucson real estate broker, has fond memories of
Jerome, recalling all the recreational facilities and services
provided by the mining company.
</P>
<P>
   She returned in 1997 for her 50th high school reunion and stayed
at the Jerome Grand Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The room was lovely,'' Schrader said. ``The building was
really sad before these people took it over. They have done wonders
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   James Byrkit, a retired NAU professor and author, also began
life in the United Verde Hospital, at dawn on June 16, 1931.
</P>
<P>
   The building holds some vivid memories for him, although he has
not seen the Jerome Grand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember having my tonsils out at age 10 and I was scared to
death when they were putting me under with the ether,'' Byrkit
said. ``They told me it wouldn't hurt. I was in horrible pain when
I woke up, so I thought they had lied to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrkit, a historian who wrote ``Forging the Copper Collar,'' an
unflattering look at the power wielded by mining companies in early
Arizona, recalls ambulances racing up the hill to the hospital
after a miner accidentally set off a dynamite charge or the mine
shaft hoists gave way.
</P>
<P>
   The surgical suite where the injured miners were treated by
longtime Jerome surgeon A.C. Carlson remains intact in the Jerome
Grand. Lighted by a skylight and a bank of windows looking down on
the town, the pale-blue tiled operating room originally was
targeted for a new life as a large hotel suite, Altherr said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's dispensary has been transformed into the Grand
View Lounge, which includes a player-piano nickelodeon that
nowadays costs a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Solariums at the end of the hospital wings have been kept as
sitting rooms for guests. A room that old blueprints call the
``Violet Ray Room'' now is a guest room.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital, now on the National Register of Historic Places,
was designed by Lescher &AMP; Mahoney, a prominent Phoenix
architectural firm.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth hospital built in Jerome. Underground
cave-ins, a common scourge of the town's buildings, weakened the
foundation of previous hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, the auctioneer, said the hotel is a hard property to
market, but the right buyer could step in and capitalize on the
Altherrs' efforts.
</P>
<P>
   He called it a chance for someone to own a piece of Arizona
history, ghosts and all. &QL;

ARIZONA LAWMAKERS MAY LAUGH TO KEEP FROM CRYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ (SECOND OF THREE PARTS) The jokes have been making the
rounds all morning in the Arizona House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   They involve Rep. Kathleen Dunbar, R-Tucson, who moderate
legislators believe agreed to cave in to conservative leaders on a
crucial vote on the state budget. Dunbar, an animal rights
activist, has been pushing her own legislation against animal
cruelty and domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Susan Gerard, leader of the moderate ``Mushroom
Coalition,'' repeats one of the jokes to a group of fellow
legislators: ``Did you hear that leadership is threatening Dunbar?
They say they've gone to the animal shelters and they'll be killing
one animal every hour until she gives in.''
</P>
<P>
   The group chuckles and another adds: ``I heard the Mushrooms
have kidnapped her dog. They told her she'll never see her dog
alive again if she caves in.''
</P>
<P>
   More laughter. For a moment, the jokes seem to reflect the
legislators' own brand of cruelty toward a freshman who dared
abandon the moderate coalition. But Gerard explains the jokes are a
cover. The stress is so great that lawmakers are alleviating their
anxiety with humor. The situation, she confesses, really isn't
funny at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arizona Republic'' followed Gerard from April 5-9 during a
crucial week in this year's legislative session, filled with the
tension of an impending budget deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday _ deals and rumors in the hallways''.``''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the morning, rumors are making the rounds. A Mushroom
is already questioning the loyalty of Rep. Tom Horne, R-Paradise
Valley, and is reporting back to Gerard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horne says he's solid. He says he's still on,'' she tells some
fellow lawmakers. ``But he says he's heard some other people were
going to double-cross him.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Everyone thinks he knows who is on the verge of changing
positions in the battle over the budget. But in the end, Gerard
says, it may be impossible to know who is jumping sides. By the
time members vote on the issue, she says the budget is bound to be
radically different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they confess,'' Gerard says, ``we can never know for
sure. And who's going to do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Gerard sighs heavily. The chime summoning legislators back to
work has sounded again.
</P>
<P>
   A House page dashes down the hallway, rounding up stragglers.
Dressed in the blue jacket and slacks that distinguish these House
gofers, a lanky, blond page politely knocks on doors and tells the
lawmakers it's time to go.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the morning, they duck in and out of a private lobby
that connects to the floor. There's news that leadership is
softening on funds for education. Gerard roams the floor and pays a
few visits to the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she settles in at her desk. But this day's session
already is about to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a really short session,'' she says as she steps into
the hallway. ``Leadership must be anxious to work more people over
today.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no time to worry about it, though. Fourth-graders from
Lookout Mountain are visiting the House today and Gerard must
address them.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for them in the House Gallery, Rep. Roberta Voss,
R-Glendale, storms in, plops herself down on a step and reveals:
``They've called me into their office. What's our story?''
</P>
<P>
   Gerard responds: ``I don't know, but I'm sticking with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, everyone seems to be restless and on edge.
</P>
<P>
   But the children visiting the Legislature don't notice a
thing. &UR; They giggle and whisper as they climb the stairs, enter the
gallery &UR; and peer onto the vacant floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess nothing is going on today,'' a parent tells her
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Just then Minority House Leader John Loredo whips past.
Some &UR; freshman Democrats are in crisis and he's trying to hold
them &UR; together.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're hearing rumors about the budget and I'm trying to
keep &UR; them from joining the leadership,'' Loredo explains. ``If I
can do that, &UR; it gives the Mushrooms more bargaining power. The
moderate Republicans, more or less, want the same thing we do.''
</P>
<P>
   After addressing the schoolchildren, Gerard is eager to get the
scoop. &UR; She persuades fellow Mushrooms Reps. Carolyn Allen and
Lou-Ann Preble to get away for lunch today. At Tom's Tavern, a
favorite hangout for lawmakers, they share the latest intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   All have heard various reports that leadership could be
softening on money for schools. Grilled by House leaders earlier,
Horne confirms the news when they arrive back in the Legislature
for their Republican caucus meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Ushering Gerard into a first-floor hallway, Horne produces a
legal pad and shows her the numbers. Leadership, he says excitedly,
is offering some money for schools but nothing for cities or
community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to know if this will pass. What do you think?''
Horne asks.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard is pleased with the funds for education. But she's still
concerned about financing for the cities and community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Oblivious to the development, Republican lawmakers sit in
caucus &UR; and listen to the bills on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In caucus, legislative analysts read bills and discuss what each
would do. Sitting around a conference table, the lawmakers
ask &UR; questions. Chairs line the walls, and advocates from various
industries &UR; fill them.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with cell phones, pagers and notebooks, the lobbyists
keep &UR; elaborate records on the bills and amendments. At times, some
rush out of &UR; the room to call their employers with the news. When
the caucus is finished, the lawmakers wait again for the session to
adjourn. But there's news that a vote could take place on
the &UR; budget.
</P>
<P>
   About 10:22 that night, the chime sounds and the weary
lawmakers &UR; trudge back onto the floor. If leadership &UR; decides to hear
the budget tonight, &UR; the session could last until dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard crosses her fingers. Sighs of relief go out when the
session is adjourned a minute later. Tired but heartened, coalition
members have won the battle today. Each day they hold off
leadership gives them hope that leadership could make concessions. &QL; 
Tuesday: The chamber and the midnight hour. &QL;

THIS WEEK'S TOO BUSY TO GET ANY REAL WORK DONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN SIDENER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's proclaim today (MONDAY) Try-to-Get-Some-Real &QL; 
-Work-Done Day.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, it needs to be adopted, proclaimed or otherwise
sponsored to fit in with the rest of the week. From bringing
daughters to work to honoring secretaries, almost every day this
week has been monikered for some cause. And Thursday has two.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday is Telework Greater Phoenix Day, which means we all
should be home wearing bathrobes as we type and handle the phones.
Razor stubble is mandatory for men. Makeup is banned for women.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are you've seen those studies saying telecommuting
increases productivity. Well, here's a little-known fact: All that
research was underwritten by America Online, the Golf Channel and
the Association of American Doctors Advocating Frequent Napping.
</P>
<P>
   So forget about getting anything done Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday is Professional Secretaries Day. Prepare for a long
line when you stop at the florist on your way to work. You'll get
to your desk an hour and a half late, barely in time to get a lunch
reservation. So write off 2{ hours for lunch. By the time you get
back to the office, you'll barely have time to answer Tuesday's
e-mail. And of course, none of the Phoenix area's secretaries will
do a lick of work, further slowing our economic engine. The only
things staving off recession will be the record earnings reported
by florists and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday is Take Our Daughters to Work Day. Bring little Suzy to
work. Spend the morning introducing her to your co-workers, showing
her the water cooler and bathroom. Show her your computer and watch
her delete that spreadsheet you've been building for the past seven
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who have only sons or dogs will watch and know
you're not getting anything done. Out of resentment, we'll surf the
Internet and make long-distance calls to friends in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   And if Take Our Daughters to Work Day isn't enough to send half
our businesses filing for Chapter 7, Thursday is also Earth Day. We
can't throw away any of the day's junk mail. We'll have to find
someplace to recycle it. Can't drive, either; that would waste gas.
We'll be walking around town with junk mail in one hand and an
empty diet soda can in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, as always, is Casual Day. So far, it doesn't have any
other name. Maybe it'll end up as Bosses' Revenge Day. Or
Nobody-Goes-Home-Until-We're-Caught-Up Day.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull's office said there are no plans to proclaim
Friday as anything special. Similarly, a spokesman for Phoenix
Mayor Skip Rimsza said the mayor is not scheduled to rename Friday.
But whether or not any work gets done, Friday will have a special
description for the city's employees, spokesman Scott Phelps said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friday will be payday,'' Phelps said. ``You can't beat
that.'' &QL;

 M's ESCAPE BRAWL WITH WIN OVER ANGELS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Brett Hinchliffe had never started a major
league game before Sunday night. He'd never been bitten on a
ballfield before Sunday night, either.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what happened to the Mariners' right-hander in the
finale of a rollicking three-game series with the Angels. Not only
did someone chomp his calf, he also got a bone bruise when someone
stomped on his left hand.
</P>
<P>
   Hinchliffe was ejected in the fourth inning of Sunday night's
8-5 Mariners win when he drilled Todd Greene after allowing a home
run to Troy Glaus. Greene charged the mound with fists flying, and
both benches and bullpens emptied.
</P>
<P>
   The melee, in a nationally televised game whose highlights
delighted the clubhouse afterward, was the culmination of an
intense weekend that began with a near-brawl Friday after M's
pitcher Jamie Moyer hit two batters in a 9-5 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junior was hit because of what happened the other night,''
said Mariners manager Lou Piniella. ``We understand that. It's good
to see Brett protect the hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. did not charge or curse when he was hit on the
backside by a fastball from knuckleballer Steve Sparks in the third
inning. Instead, Griffey calmly and deliberately pointed his bat
toward the Anaheim dugout. Call it the tremor before the quake,
because a rumble was coming.
</P>
<P>
   It arrived when Hinchliffe hit Greene _ accidentally, he
insisted _ and suddenly had a 5-foot-10, 208-pound former catcher
charging his 6-foot-5, 190-pound frame. Greene, who homered Friday
and Saturday, did something he didn't do often this weekend: swung
and missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quick on my toes,'' Hinchliffe said. ``I'm not going to
get caught. He was coming at me and I was ready, and then he
stopped. He tried to get in a couple of haymakers, and I slipped
out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinchliffe said Greene had been crushing pitches low and away
this weekend, but he retired him in the first inning when he jammed
him with a fastball. Hinchliffe said he was only trying to come in
there again ... but acknowledged this weekend's tensions had to
come out sometime.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of guys were hit the first day, and again the third
day,'' Hinchliffe said. ``It was good to get it out of the way. If
he hadn't charged, they were probably just going to hit another
guy. It might have started too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinchliffe said he was surprised he got ejected, since umpires
did not issue a warning even after Griffey pointed his bat. Of that
gesture, Griffey said, ``It doesn't matter. It's over and done
with. Just leave it like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim manager Terry Collins was similarly evasive about what
he told Griffey on the field during the brawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him it's a beautiful day and a nice crowd,'' Collins
said. ``I told him I didn't want him to get hurt on the bottom of
that pile.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Sparks said he wasn't trying to hit Griffey,
claiming he threw him the same kind of cut fastball he retired him
on in the first inning. Piniella noted one good thing about the six
hit-by-pitches over Friday and Sunday's games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hitters that were hit were hit in the middle area,''
Piniella said. ``There was no head-hunting or anything else. We
don't advocate that, for sure. ... (But) our pitchers protect our
hitters. Every club in baseball does the same. Our pitchers know
what they have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   So did the Mariners' hitters Sunday night. Griffey was hit with
two outs and the bases empty in a 2-2 game. Edgar Martinez followed
with a run-scoring double down the right-field line, and Jay Buhner
homered one batter later to give the M's a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to get the best of that inning, because
obviously you don't want your main guy to get hit,'' Martinez said.
``This team gets pretty pumped up after something like that
happens. It's great to see that work to our advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez pulled a double in the fifth inning to score Griffey
again, and Butch Huskey accounted for the rest of the offense with
a run-scoring single and solo homer. Ken Cloude (1-1), Jose
Paniagua and Jose Mesa worked 41/3 scoreless relief innings to
secure the Mariners' second victory in a row _ and the series win
over Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels were runners-up to Seattle in 1995 and '97, the teams
had a post-game scrap this spring training, their third base
coaches went at it Friday night and Piniella had to be restrained
from charging a fan that same evening.
</P>
<P>
   So is it over now?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is over in my mind,'' Greene said, ``but no one in this
clubhouse is going to run away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over right now, because we're not playing them anymore,''
said Mariners first baseman David Segui. ``I would assume it is. I
think.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels visit Seattle for a three-game series June 22-24.

   BOSTON _ The 103d Boston Marathon begins Monday at high noon by
the village green in Hopkinton and winds its way through eight
cities and towns to the finish line on Boylston Street in the Back
Bay. This is the final Boston of the 1900s, the world's oldest
continuing marathon enters its third century next year, and all is
right with the race.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since John Hancock Mutual Life began pouring its millions
into the coffers 14 years ago, the race was revitalized on the
international stage, and after a weekend that saw Rotterdam and
London pass quietly into the history books, Boston takes center
stage on this Patriots Day. Hancock's investment is $1.2 million,
plus staff, and extras to the cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
   With Abdelkader El Mouaziz of Morocco winning Sunday's men's
race in London in 2 hours 7 minutes 57 seconds and Japhet Kosgei of
Kenya taking Rotterdam in 2:07:11, and Tegla Loroupe of Kenya
claiming the women's race in Rotterdam in 2:22:50 and Joyce
Chepchumba of Kenya winning London in a course-record 2:23:22,
times are on the table, and now it is in the hands of Boston
defenders Moses Tanui of Kenya and Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Dave D'Alessandro, the president and CEO of John Hancock who
stepped to the fore to provide the major sponsorship, sees the
congested weekend in the proper light. ``London and Rotterdam
always hurt us,'' said D'Alessandro. ``Yet we're in a cycle now
where there are a lot of emerging names. I think we're in a cycle
now where it's really interesting. I think we're about to see new
stars as we prepare for the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   The dominant presence of the Kenyans is recognized every year on
the eve of Boston, and there are eight elite runners in the field
out of the African nation led by defender and two-time winner Tanui
and two-time New York City Marathon champion John Kagwe. In a Globe
poll of media members, Tanui received six votes to win and Kagwe
five. Joseph Chebet, who was second in Boston and New York last
year by three seconds, received three votes and Sammy Korir two.
Vanderlei Lima of Brazil earned the remaining first-place vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kenyans as a team are the strongest in the world,'' said
D'Alessandro, ``and the Northern Europeans can't decide whether or
not they want to run against them. The problem is that the Kenyans
tend to be unpredictably strong; some runners' fear is they don't
want to run in a pack against the Kenyans. It is difficult for a
single runner to come here and run against the deeper teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty lonely when you're running against eight strong
Kenyans. I'm not going to run against eight or 10 guys from the
same country, all of whom are capable of perhaps winning or
finishing in the top three. They're going to strategically try to
break me. They worry about each other later. They say, `Let's break
this guy now.' Teams will run together, and the Kenyans will run
and worry about beating each other later.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've also built up a strong relationship with this
marathon. I would not be in favor of trying to load up a race. The
BAA has been great at this. They haven't tried through prize and
appearance money to balance the race. They haven't said, `This is
an American race.' They've said, `Here's the prize money. You guys
decide.' This may be one of the best events in that respect. It
does have a down side, when you have only deep teams from countries
that are hard to run against.''
</P>
<P>
   The prohibitive favorite in the women's race is Olympic gold
medalist and two-time defender Roba, who received 14 of 17 votes in
the Globe poll. Interestingly, Lynn Jennings received two. ``I
picked Bill Rodgers to win in 1975 when nobody heard of him,'' said
running guru Tommy Leonard, who was on the Jennings bandwagon.
``She doesn't enter a race if she doesn't think she'll win,'' was
someone else's opinion. She won three World Cross-Country
Championships, a race former Boston record-holder Rob de Castella
once said is the toughest race in the world to win.
</P>
<P>
   Roba and Loroupe have been dominant forces in women's
marathoning, but they will have competed on different continents by
the time Monday's race is history in Beantown. The backdrop is that
Tanui and Roba are both trying to win three Bostons. Clarence DeMar
(7), Bill Rodgers (4), and Gerard Cote (4) are the only ones to
have won four times or more. Will Tanui win three? ``Why not
four?'' he responds.

WAYNE'S WHIRL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wayne Gretzky bundled up his passion and his points
here Sunday, his legendary run complete after 20 years, 894 goals,
and 1,963 assists, and waved goodbye to Broadway, the Blueshirts,
and a lifetime as hockey's most prolific and best-known performer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to a good friend of mine today that this is not a
passing on,'' said Gretzky in the moments that followed the
Rangers' 2-1 overtime loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins at Madison
Square Garden. ``It's a moving on. It's a great game to watch, to
play, and it's going to kill me not to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``But time does something to you _ and it's time.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Bell Canada lineman, who already was being called
The Kid prior to joining the NHL in 1979, Gretzky fittingly picked
up an assist in his 1,487th game. The assist was always his
signature, and he helped set up a Brian Leetch goal to make it 1-1
with 29.9 seconds to go in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   For the 2,857th time, for the last time, the best known hockey
name in the world was entered on the scoresheet. Gretzky would be
sitting on the bench when Jaromir Jagr's game-winner, 1:22 into
overtime, went in the net, and at 5:57 p.m. Gretzky's career came
to an end before a hushed sellout crowd of 18,200.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky played 22 shifts for a total of 22 minutes, 30 seconds,
including two shifts late in the third period when everyone not
dressed in Penguin gold-and-white looked for the Great One to end
it with a goal, which would have been akin to Ted Williams exiting
with his home run swat in 1960. But it was not to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could have been (Michael) Jordan, hitting the last
shot to win a championship,'' said Gretzky, who became accustomed
to heroics and the thrill of victory in his heyday, winning four
Stanley Cups with the Oilers in the '80s. ``But that wasn't going
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   To provide the perfect segue, it was Jagr, who became the game's
greatest current player even before the post-Gretzky era began, who
ultimately buried the winner. Collecting the puck down low near the
right post, he magically played with it before sweeping his
backhander past Rangers goalie Mike Richter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fitting,'' said Gretzky, who made a point of hugging Jagr for
an extra second or two after the game. ``Everyone thinks about
catching that last pass to win the game . . . and that's what I
told him, `You caught it.' He said he didn't mean to do that and I
told him, `That's what I used to say.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For farewells, the three-hour-plus show just south of Broadway's
famous playhouses was a smooth, touching tribute to the 38-year-old
Gretzky. It did not rank among the emotional, pathos-evoking,
almost painful farewells of Bob Cousy or Lou Gehrig.
</P>
<P>
   Who could forget the Cooz, family at his side on the Garden
parquet floor, making his tearful farewell speech. And Gehrig's
adieu at Yankee Stadium, his words, ``Today, I consider myself the
luckiest man on the face of the earth,'' echoing through the Bronx
Canyon, his career, and soon his life, shortened by amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky was more emotional Friday when he stood before a large
media gathering inside MSG's Paramount Room and officially
announced his retirement. He said then that he had hit the wall, he
had the urge for goin', and Sunday he hoped would be a rite of
celebration, more in context of a wedding than a funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good cry before I left home,'' said Gretzky,
reflecting on how he felt Friday. ``It's hard to get up and tell
the world you're leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony did hold its surprises, the most poignant of which
was NHL commissioner Gary Bettman announcing before faceoff that
Gretzky's No. 99 never would be worn in the league again. It was
not raised to the MSG rafters _ that ceremony will come another
time _ but Bettman's mandate made it clear that no NHLer would
skate in Gretzky's shadow or his sweater.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will miss you,'' said Bettman, ``and there will never be
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky also received a black S500 four-door Mercedes sedan from
the Rangers, wheeled to center ice with his father Walter Gretzky
in the passenger seat. The senior Gretzky, now 60 years old,
reminisced with reporters outside the Rangers dressing room before
the game. He talked of his son's first skates, hand-me-downs he
received at age three, and the day the greatest scorer that ever
would be took his first skate on the Don River in Brantford.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Gretzky's son was small, frail, and he gave his father no
reason early on to think the family name would become synonymous
throughout the world with the game of ice hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has said to me, `Sometimes I have to pinch myself, this
whole thing is like a dream,' '' said Walter Gretzky, echoing his
son's words to him over the last two decades. ``Even he says that,
so you can imagine how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, father asked son about the prospect of
retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he said to me, `Well, dad, you have to understand,' ''
said Walter, `` `every year I go to training camp, and the guys are
bigger, stronger, faster . . . and I am getting older.' I don't
think he ever wanted to get to the point where someone said to him,
`Wayne, we think you should retire.' He wouldn't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was not so old that he had lost his effectiveness.
Gretzky's assist in his final game gave him 62 points in 70 games
for the season. It pales in comparison to the four 200-plus point
seasons he had with the speedy, talented Oilers in the '80s, but it
still made him a valuable commodity in today's clogged-up,
slowed-down NHL. The Rangers were hoping he would return and told
him last week that they'd pick up the $5 million option on his
contract. By the time they made their decision, however, Gretzky
already had made the emotional commitment to walk away while he was
still an effective, even if lesser, performer.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at the interview room after the loss, the game
finished for more than hour, Gretzky was still in full uniform. The
dark blue Ranger sweater was drenched across the chest. He still
wore his padded pants. There hadn't been time, he said, to talk
with teammates, friends, and family and shower before his final
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``And probably, subconsciously, I don't want to take it off,''
said Gretzky, who also wore the sweater of the Oilers, Kings, and
Blues in his NHL career. ``I mean, I'm not going to put it on ever
again. It's hard. To be honest with you, I don't want to take it
off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Garden crowd was treated to an afternoon more of melancholy
and memories. Mario Lemieux, whom Gretzky acknowledged as the
greatest player he ever played against, flew in from Pittsburgh.
Old pal Mark Messier, still adored by the Rangers crowd for leading
the Blueshirts to their first Cup in 54 years in 1994, made the
trip from Vancouver. Paul Coffey made it. Ulf Samuelsson, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were close when (Samuelsson) played here,'' said Gretzky.
``I didn't know he was coming. That threw me over the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Within three minutes after the game ended, Gretzky was at center
ice with his fellow Rangers, posing for a final team picture. He
disappeared down the runway at 6 p.m., only to return three minutes
later for the first of two curtain calls. He looked awkward at
times, as if not knowing what to do, where to go, how to express
himself, the ice surface for once in his career strange, uncharted
territory.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up a bouquet of flowers tossed to the ice. He picked
up baseball caps. Near the Zamboni entrance, he spotted Christopher
Reeve, the actor confined to a wheelchair from a horseback riding
accident, and gave him a hug.
</P>
<P>
   He left the ice for good at 6:13 p.m., his face alternately
smiling and stoic, offering a last, emphatic goodbye with a wave of
his arms. There wouldn't be a third curtain call. He was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not only mentally ready,'' he said, ``but I'm physically
ready to retire. I'm ready.''

BRUINS DROP TO SIXTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Greensboro, N.C., doesn't exactly come to mind
when discussing hockey hotbeds. Not in the way that, let's say,
Toronto does.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bruins president/general manager Harry Sinden said that in
terms of hockey interest, the cities ``are from one extreme to the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   But Greensboro is just where the Bruins are heading, as their
opponents for their best-of-seven, first-round series are the
Carolina Hurricanes. Games 1 and 2 are Thursday and Saturday at the
Greensboro Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of Sunday's 3-1 loss to the Flyers, which was a
snoozer of epic proportions, the Bruins finished in sixth place in
the Eastern Conference and will be matched against the third-seeded
Hurricanes, who finished with a worse record than Boston (34-30-18
versus the locals' 39-30-13) but earned their seed by winning the
Southeast Division.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Bruins won or tied Sunday, they would have faced the
Maple Leafs, against whom they went 3-1-1 in the regular season.
Boston tied the season series with Carolina, 2-2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got some winners on that team who have won before,''
said coach Pat Burns. ``We didn't exactly walk away with all kinds
of success against them. We'll be a good match for them, and
they'll be a good match for us. It'll be an interesting series. It
will be a long one.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the undermanned Bruins, who looked as if they were
suffering from an emotional hangover after their 2-1 win over
Buffalo Saturday, played even with the Flyers for one period. At
the 3:44 mark of the first, with the Flyers on the power play,
right wing Mark Grieg dished a feed to left wing John LeClair, who
tried to tip a shot past Rob Tallas. The goalie made the stop, but
LeClair put the rebound on his backhand and flipped it in for the
1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins came right back, with Sergei Samsonov tallying his
25th goal of the year on the team's first shot of the game.
Samsonov took a pass from Ken Belanger, skated through the left
circle, and beat goalie John Vanbiesbrouck with a backhander inside
the left post at 4:54.
</P>
<P>
   Boston had six shots in the first period and just five in the
final 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia took the lead for good at the 15:30 mark, just six
seconds into another power play. With Mattias Timander off for
tripping, defenseman Eric Desjardins teed up a slapper from the
right point through traffic that beat the screened Tallas.
</P>
<P>
   In the dull second period, which slowed to an absolute crawl,
Rob Brind'Amour made it a two-goal lead with his 24th of the season
at 13:08.
</P>
<P>
   In the scheme of things, Sunday's game was one worth forgetting
_ quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were missing a lot of elements,'' said Burns. ``All my
penalty killers weren't there today. Not that I fault Robbie
Tallas, but Byron Dafoe is a big part of our penalty killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could sit here and talk all we want, but the game today,
good luck to the Flyers. It wasn't very good; it was awful. We had
two games in two days. The last two weeks, I've liked. You can't
count today. I didn't like nothing today. I just liked when I heard
the last buzzer.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Burns was pleased with how the season ended. ``At the
start of the year, if I said we would've played the Flyers for
fifth place today, you probably would've laughed at me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Sunday was hard on anyone, it was Tallas, who for the second
time in recent weeks was in net when his team was going through a
letdown. The last time was April 8, one night after the Bruins had
clinched a playoff spot against Florida; they then fell flat
against Tampa Bay in a 3-0 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Sunday, however, Tallas and his teammates were in a very
positive frame of mind. ``We had a great game (Saturday) night at
home, we had a few injuries and a few guys sitting out, and that's
the way it's going to happen sometimes,'' said Tallas. ``We've been
together for 81 games, and if you look around the league, you want
to get it done and get into the playoffs. Now we have a new goal.''

DOYLE TOPS FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
 SENIORS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. _ Always, he felt he had to prove
himself. He knew he could play, but ``everywhere I've gone people
have dismissed me as a guy probably not very good.''
</P>
<P>
   So Allen Doyle did Sunday what he always has done _ let them
chuckle at his golf swing as he knocked down the pins. Only this
time he did it in a most spectacular fashion at a most special
event. The one-time hockey player at Catholic Memorial and Norwich
University shot a closing 8-under-par 64 to come from four shots
back and win the 60th PGA Seniors' Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle finished at 14-under 274, blistering PGA National's
Champions Course with nine birdies and one eagle. It was his second
win of the year, a 22-putt final round, the lowest close in tourney
history, a win worth $315,000, and left many stunned. When told
that his playing partner, New Englander Dana Quigley, had called it
``one of the greatest rounds of golf I have ever seen,'' Doyle
shook his head, almost in disbelief. ``Me, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He had started the day four shots behind Vicente Fernandez and
Bruce Fleisher but gave little thought to what it would take to
win. But he certainly was confident enough to let that homemade
swing do its thing. Doyle grew up in Norwood, learned the game as a
caddie at Spring Valley CC in Sharon, and would practice his swing
during cold winter days in a cellar with a low ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the backswing is low and the follow-through quick, though
``in my mind it isn't as fast as it looks.'' What was fast was his
move up the leaderboard in this oldest major in professional senior
golf.
</P>
<P>
   He made a birdie from 4 feet on the first hole, then drained a
45-footer on No. 2 to go to 8-under. ``That's when I was thinking
that it might be my day,'' said Doyle.
</P>
<P>
   Two holes later, Doyle gave back both shots, making his only
double-bogey of the tournament. ``That's when I thought I was
playing for a good paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
   He was, though the price soared when Doyle made birdies at five,
seven, and nine to make the turn in 33 to get to 9-under, then
shaved two more shots off par with a chip-in eagle from 80-90 feet
at the par-5 10th. Though he gave one back at the 11th, Doyle ran
off birdies at the next three holes to get to 13-under. ``That's
when I got the feeling I was a little blessed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention applying some pressure to the guys behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' said Fernandez, ``I was looking at the leaderboard, so
I knew what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't quite know the worst of it, however, because the lead
groups were heading into what they call ``The Bear Trap,'' the
final four holes of this grueling course that was re-designed by
Jack Nicklaus 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the par-3 15th, a mere 164 yards that is all carry over
water, Doyle made his three, then drove it perfectly at the
toughest hole on the course, the 428-yard par-4 16th. He was one
shot out of the lead and facing a 4-iron shot from 193 yards. ``But
I don't carry a 4-iron,'' said Doyle, ``so I hit 3. I aimed it 25
feet left of the pin.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle cut it beautifully and it held into the wind, the ball
coming to rest a mere foot from the pin. ``If it was 4 or 5 feet,''
he said, ``I don't know if I could have made it. But I can make 'em
from a foot.''
</P>
<P>
   It put him in a tie for the lead, but only momentarily. As he
went to mark his ball on the green at the par-3 17th, Doyle heard
the crowd react. Looking up at the scoreboard, Fernandez's score
went from 14-under to 12. The Bear Trap had bit him with a
double-bogey at 15. ``He played a great round,'' said Fernandez,
who shot 70_276 to finish alone in second, ``but I helped him a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher shot 73 to finish in a tie for third with Jose Maria
Canizares (72) at 279. Quigley got it to 10-under through 14, but
saw his chances sink with a shot in the water at 15, too. He
finished 70_280, tied for fifth with Bruce Summerhays (70).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, pars at 17 and 18 brought Doyle home to an ovation.
The championship hardware sat just off the 18th green as Doyle went
through formalities no one could have predicted for this man who
figured he would be an amateur forever.
</P>
<P>
   There had been temptations to turn pro, but he felt he was too
old. That's when he was in his 30s and fresh off a military stint
in Korea. ``You don't play much golf in the DMZ,'' he said. So he
racked up a bunch of amateur championships in Georgia, played some
Walker Cups, left the textile business, and made a decent living
with a driving range.
</P>
<P>
   When it become apparent that the Senior PGA Tour was for real,
Doyle gave in to temptation. He was 47 when he turned pro in 1995
and the road since has been one test after another, from Nike Tour
to PGA Tour to this, his first full season as a 50-year-old
professional golfer.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle was told his name would go on a trophy alongside those of
Sam Snead, Arnold Palmer, Nicklaus, and Gary Player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can believe all of this,'' said Doyle, ``but I do have to
pinch myself.''

RED SOX OFFENSE FAILS AGAIN

 SOX-DEVIL RAYS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It could be worse. Just ask Don Zimmer, provisional
caretaker of the supposedly greater-than-ever New York Yankees, who
have lost four straight to match their longest losing streak of
1998. Zim's knee may not be all that needs reconstructive surgery
after George Steinbrenner gives him the obligatory earful.
</P>
<P>
   But to a constituency that seldom sees beyond that insular world
bounded by Lansdowne Street, Van Ness, and Yawkey Way, the big
picture is usually eclipsed by whatever daily calamities have been
visited upon the Olde Towne Team.
</P>
<P>
   And for the 27,589 present at thawing Fenway Park for Sunday's
5-1 loss to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, their third loss against just
two wins in their first homestand, there were no more pressing
concerns than the condition of Tom Gordon's elbow, the lack of
muscle shown by the Red Sox offense, and the worrisome start of
rookie right fielder Trot Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was placed on the 15-day disabled list even before
undergoing a magnetic resonance imaging exam Sunday at UMass
Medical Center in Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   How bad is it? The Red Sox claimed they were still awaiting word
after the game; for now, it's still being called a strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flash has been pointing up at the Lord all this time,''
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said. ``Maybe it's time for the Lord to
point down to him. No sense worrying about it until we get the
results.''
</P>
<P>
   The results have been just as slow in coming for the Sox
offense, which couldn't take advantage of Nomar Garciaparra
reaching base on all four of his plate appearances Sunday with a
double, single, and two walks.
</P>
<P>
   Canton's Bobby Witt limited the Sox to a run on four hits in six
innings, then turned the game over to a bullpen that allowed just
Jason Varitek's eighth-inning single the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Any time the Sox did stir, the Devil Rays answered with a
silencing play afield. Tampa Bay rookie left fielder Danny Clyburn,
who should have a closetful of Gold Gloves based on his play
against the Sox, made two diving catches to take hits away from
Jeff Frye, and second baseman Miguel Cairo spun a rally-killing
double play in the seventh, spearing Jose Offerman's grounder up
the middle with a backhanded stab, then flipping the ball with his
glove to shortstop Kevin Stocker.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Sox rank last in the American League in home runs
with six, the Devil Rays Sunday hit three home runs, including the
third in three games here by designated villain Jose Canseco, who
has as many home runs as his former team.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco's sixth-inning home run Sunday off Sox starter Pat Rapp,
who struck out seven and gave up just four hits in seven innings,
was another one of those
boo-me-any-louder-and-I'm-hitting-the-next-one-into-the-river jobs,
just like the previous two. It landed among the cars in the back
row of the parking lot beyond the Green Monster, hard by the
railroad tracks next to the Mass. Pike.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco has scorched Sox general manager Dan Duquette many times
in the past, but didn't swing when lobbed a fat pitch about what he
thought about having as many home runs as the Sox nearly two weeks
into the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I think about it?'' said Canseco, who hasn't lost his
sense of humor, mugging and waving to the kiddies on Kids' Opening
Day Saturday even as the boos rained down. ``I don't think about
it. What am I supposed to think about it?''
</P>
<P>
   Witt wasn't biting at the idea that the 1999 Sox lineup poses
fewer threats than its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not at all,'' Witt said. ``They've got guys over there
that can play baseball. They know how to play it and they know how
to win. Granted Mo's gone, but Nomar's back and there's (John)
Valentin and (Mike) Stanley. I don't ever take a team lightly.
They've got just as good a team as anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, that idea seems a stretch as it applies to Nixon,
who has no hits in nine at-bats on the homestand, was 0 for 4 with
two strikeouts Sunday, and overall is 2 for 25 with an .080
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times I find myself aggressive, right where I want to be,''
said Nixon, whom Valentin engaged in a very visible heart-to-heart
chat in the clubhouse after the game. ``Other times I find myself
being passive, I don't know why. It's like I'm trying to read the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the home fans are offering their customary support
when one of their own is struggling. Canseco was the only person
who heard more boos than Nixon. ``That's really going to make it
easier,'' Frye said, shaking his head. ``Booing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon took the defiant approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what the fans do,'' Nixon said. ``I play for the
team. I play for the fans, too, and the organization, but if
they're going to say something derogatory, that just shows their
class.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, manager Jimy Williams has yet to invite the fans to fill
out his lineup card.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing him,'' Williams said of Nixon. ``If I thought
there was any type of situation involved, watching a player, I'd do
something. But watching him, he's still having good at-bats, he
feels good about himself in the batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he's a player. Things can happen in one at-bat, one
game. Things can change very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   It was still 3-1 in the ninth when Devil Rays third baseman
Bobby Smith dropped a fly ball into the right-field seats, just
inside the Pesky Pole, off pitcher-for-the-day Brian Rose, called
up just for the afternoon from Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a job to do,'' Rose said. ``A 3 to 1 game, I'm trying to
get them back in the dugout. I was praying, hoping that it would
come down, but the ball kept carrying. That home run was like
taking the air out of a balloon.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing to do but sleep fast for this morning's matinee, when
the Sox face Devil Rays ace Rolando Arrojo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get any easier (Monday),'' Frye said. ``Eleven
o'clock start, against that guy. Nothing to do but just keep
swinging.''

PEERS LEFT COLD BY PATRIOTS' DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ No dean's list for New England this year.
</P>
<P>
   For the third year in a row the Patriots' draft got mixed
reviews from a panel of their peers interviewed Sunday night when
the draft was over.
</P>
<P>
   Four general managers and a coach participated, with the
agreement that they remain anonymous. Two were from the AFC, three
from the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   They all were asked to talk about the players the Patriots took,
and what grade they would give them overall.
</P>
<P>
   AFC general manager: ``Damien Woody is a very good pick. With
the right coaching, he could be a heck of a player. Whether he will
or not remains to be seen, because he didn't play with a lot of
intensity at Boston College last year. He seemed indifferent about
playing. But he has talent. We had him and Andy Katzenmoyer rated
between 20 and 30 on our board, or just about where they went. Both
should be good players. Katzenmoyer has to play a little smarter
than he's been playing. He doesn't make a lot of good decisions
when you watch him play on tape. Kevin Faulk was a good pick. I
like their top three guys. Faulk can make some plays in space. He's
not a full-time back. The rest of the guys they picked are just
guys. We wouldn't have drafted the last two guys they took (Michael
Bishop and Sean Morey); they weren't on our board. They already
have four safeties (Lawyer Milloy, Willie Clay, Chris Carter, Larry
Whigham) _ why would they draft two more?'' Grade: B.
</P>
<P>
   AFC coach: ``We had Woody rated between 25 and 35. He was the
best center in the draft. We would not have taken Katzenmoyer. In
our opinion, what you see is what you get. We looked at his film
for three years, and he is the same player he was as a freshman. It
makes you believe this is how good he is going to be. He had a
tremendous workout, an all-time workout, and that brought him back
in the eyes of some teams. But those kinds of workouts can be
dangerous. Faulk got taken where he should have. He's a Dave
Meggett kind of player. We like Tony George, but we think he will
be a backup player in this league, and not a starter. There is no
way we would have drafted Derrick Fletcher. The man is totally out
of shape. He will be a coach's nightmare. We thought about taking
Marcus Washington late; he was a seventh-round pick on our board.
And we would not have drafted either of the last two guys.'' Grade:
C.
</P>
<P>
   NFC GM No. 1: ``To end up with what they got, starting out with
11 picks and two in the first round, is terrible. We had Woody a
second-round pick, and we didn't see any reason why they traded up
to get him. The Giants weren't going to draft him. We just didn't
like the way Woody played his senior year. Katzenmoyer, same way, a
boom-or-bust guy. A year ago the kid would have been a Top 10 pick,
but after last season he is very questionable. We liked Faulk. He's
a spot player, 10 to 12 carries a game, some kick returns. He can
help them. We didn't like any of the players they drafted after
that. Tony George rated just about where they drafted him. Michael
Bishop is worth taking a shot at, but he has very low test scores.
With the number of picks they had, they just should have done
more.'' Grade: C minus.
</P>
<P>
   NFC GM No. 2: ``We liked Woody a lot. They got him right about
where we thought he might go, 18 to 22. He's big, fast, good feet,
and very athletic. We didn't understand the Katzenmoyer pick. Don't
they have enough linebackers already? We didn't like him because he
gets knocked off his feet too much. Faulk is good, but not great. I
call him a system runner. He just gets what is there, no more. We
like Fletcher, but he's a project. He had tremendous size and moves
well. He is a guy with a lot of upside, but right now he is just
too heavy and he has no motor. He doesn't give it to you two plays
in a row. We like Tony George. Overall, I like their top four guys
and think they can help them.'' Grade: B.
</P>
<P>
   NFC GM No. 3: ``Woody is a talent, but he'll never be a great
player unless he learns to play harder and stay in shape. He was
not in shape when our team worked him out. Katzenmoyer is a real
gamble. He has size, speed, and can hit, but he is green as grass.
Faulk's not a feature back, not your No. 1 guy. He can be effective
as a third-down guy or in the kick return game. Of the rest of the
guys they drafted, the only one we had some interest in was Marcus
Washington, because he has a lot of athletic ability, but so far he
has been an underachiever. On the whole, they should have done
better with so many picks, but the top three guys they drafted
should be able to help them.'' Grade: B.
</P>
<P>
   Their consensus was that the Patriots blew three picks trading
up to get Woody and Faulk when they didn't have to.
</P>
<P>
   Woody should be a very good player. Katzenmoyer has great
physical skills but seems to be getting worse instead of better.
Faulk can be an effective part-time player. The safeties, George
and Washington, are backup players; and Fletcher, Bishop, and Morey
have very little chance of being solid players in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   To set the record straight, the Patriots did talk to other teams
about including Terry Glenn in a trade if it could have brought
them Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   What the Patriots tried to do was to fill in the holes left by
the injury to Robert Edwards and the free agency defections of
center Dave Wohlabaugh and linebacker Todd Collins. The drafting of
two safeties seems to indicate that they are ready to get rid of
ones they have.

FANS HOPE NIXON GETS GOING SOON 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-NIXON-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's happening much too soon for Red Sox outfielder
Trot Nixon. Only 11 games into the season, the same fans who
cheered him on Opening Day at Fenway Park last week were on his
case Sunday . . . big time.
</P>
<P>
   It is a message that Nixon must grasp quickly if he is to
survive in Boston. The fans are responding in part to a sudden dip
in the Red Sox' fortunes _ three losses in the last four starts
against the White Sox and Devil Rays. They are directing catcalls
his way, a strong reminder that his 0-for-9 slump on the homestand
has not gone unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   But No. 7 will be in right field Monday despite an .080 batting
average, because the Sox have a lot invested in him. There are no
plans to back away from the commitment first made to him in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his minor league career, Nixon has been an aggressive
competitor. The Red Sox are counting on Nixon's growth as a hitter
much like they counted on that of a young John Valentin or Nomar
Garciaparra. His stats have not been great, but they've been very
good, and who knows what could happen down the road?
</P>
<P>
   This is the next level, however. Nixon earned his shot by
batting .310 in 135 games at Pawtucket last year. He played 18
games in spring training and came north as the regular right
fielder. He was determined to do better. So don't think something
like a little early slump is going to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to help the team win,'' he told a crowd of reporters
Sunday. ``Sometimes I try too hard when I go to the plate. But
that's just me. Perfection is what I want.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said in the past that this could be my downfall, but it's
hard to change something when you've been doing it since you were
15-16 years old. I don't know if it's healthy or not. But it's a
motivator.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's luck hasn't been very good thus far this season. He has
lost four or five possible hits when he batted balls right at
people. He has struck out eight times in seven games, not good from
a man expected to help hold up the bottom half of the order. That
part of the order hasn't done well collectively, with center
fielder Darren Lewis benched Sunday (.167) as well as Donnie Sadler
(.174). All three contributed to the strong Sox hitting this
spring. Somebody has to step up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with Trot,'' said hitting coach Jim
Rice. ``He's just got to go out and get some hits. A lot of guys
are not hitting. You just can't say Trot. This is Trot's first
year. He has to learn a little bit more about pitchers and about
himself. That's going to come. It's a little more work, but we're
not worried about that. What we have to do is build up his
confidence. If we didn't think he could do it, he wouldn't be here
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon doesn't think a lot of those fans who yelled insults. His
game preparation is excellent and he works hard on his offensive
and defensive skills. ``I don't care what the fans do,'' he said.
``I play for the team. I play for the fans, too, and the
organization, but if they're going to say something derogatory,
that just shows their class.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon says he often has agonized about his slow starts, and
things usually work themselves out. It helps that he is surrounded
by veterans like Valentin, who spoke to him privately after the
game for 15 minutes before the press got to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably try too hard during the game to make things
happen,'' said Nixon. ``It's always been mental, and I know you
can't afford to mentally defeat yourself. I don't feel like I'm
doing anything wrong at the plate. I just try to be perfect and see
every ball instead of just going out and attacking the ball. No
matter what happens, I've just got to keep going.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is funny. It can be going good, and then all of a
sudden you just crumble. It's a long season at times. But I try to
remain constant in that I go out and work just as hard the next
day. I want to prove I belong here. I'm going to keep working. I'm
not going to give up. I've been down these roads before. Somehow,
someway, it all turns around.''
</P>
<P>
   Sox manager Jimy Williams reserves the last word on Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think his numbers so far reflect how he's hit the
ball,'' Williams said. ``If you look at his last at-bat, he took
some good swings against a very good pitcher. Some good rips. To
me, the kid's a player. He is ready. Maybe it hasn't happened
enough for those people who write and who have microphones. I like
the kid a lot. I look at the person. I look at the man.''

GALDERISI WEIGHS VALUE OF LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ After a month of MLS games, the Revolution
have not yet lost in regulation time. But a victory over the
Columbus Crew Saturday might not have been as beneficial as the 0-0
regulation time result and shootout loss.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that was Giuseppe Galderisi's assessment after his
second match as unofficial assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't lose, and we were playing against a good team,''
Galderisi said. ``But maybe it would have been better if we had
lost because we played a bad first half. If we played a bad game
but won in the shootout, how can I be happy?
</P>
<P>
   ``In six months, 1 point more or 1 point less is not going to
change anything. We have to finish ahead of two teams and we will
be in the playoffs. And for that, we need to play better.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Revolution never have had a winning record since
being founded in 1996, even adding in the successes in shootouts.
The team has earned 102 points in 100 games, second lowest per-game
average in MLS. The team's official records of 15-17, 15-17, and
11-21 have been deceptive, especially since the core of the defense
was stripped away with the loss of Francis Okaroh to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Player-coach Walter Zenga and Galderisi have been attempting to
restore the team's confidence, as well as its defensive
organization. Though the Revolution have earned only 3 points from
four games, they have outscored the opposition, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   And this is one of the toughest stretches of the year for the
Revolution, since they will meet D.C. United for the second time in
two weeks Saturday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Galderisi's status remains unclear as contract
negotiations continue. The Revolution likely will get their money's
worth from Galderisi, no matter the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in this team, but we need time, we need to work,''
Galderisi said. ``It's going to take more than two hours a day. We
might need to train six hours a day. And if we need to, we will
work in the night, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to work on everything, physical, tactical, technical.
Mostly, it is mental. The mind is the most important thing, not the
legs. The littlest things can affect the confidence. One little
thing can totally change the mentality of the team. And this is
what the team needs to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no goals scored in the Columbus game, only the fifth
time that both teams have failed to score in the Revolution's
history. But there were several crisis points to provide drama.
Zenga's extraordinary goalkeeping kept the Revolution in contention
in the first half. Then, midfielder Edwin Gorter volatilely
confronted Galderisi after being substituted early in the second
half, one of the few outward signs of potential discord on the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gorter was sparking midfield play, the Revolution seemed
more comfortable without him. They were less threatening
offensively but more compact defensively, raising questions about
the direction and dynamics of the team. Things could be further
complicated by the expected return of Imad Baba (groin) this week
and John Harkes (knee ligament) for the visit of Colorado May 1,
when the Revolution are expected to attract the millionth fan for a
regular-season match; their home attendance is 987,265 after a
crowd of 14,732 for Columbus.

WALKER LOST IN CELTICS' WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rick Pitino is busy adding favorite wins to his
list. Friday night's comeback over Miami was one. Sunday's had to
be another (even though he may have lost captain Antoine Walker for
the season with an ankle sprain).
</P>
<P>
   With two starters (Kenny Anderson, Ron Mercer) out and a third
(Walker) gone after 5 1/2 minutes, the Celtics still hung on for a
wire-to-wire, 101-98 victory over the Wizards before 14,964 at the
MCI Center. The Celtics came close to reprising Miami's el foldo
Friday, looking more and more like Harold Lloyd hanging onto the
clock hands as Washington closed within a point. But a last-gasp
Wizards possession yielded only a Chris Whitney no-hoper.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said he was ``remarkably shocked and pleasantly
surprised'' by the outcome. It was Boston's sixth win in eight
games and second over the Wizards in 11 days. But it also was
costly. The team's leading scorer sprained his left ankle after
making a layup and won't be back anytime soon. Monday's game at the
FleetCenter against Indiana will mark the first time he has missed
a game in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Making up for the MIAs were rookie Paul Pierce, who matched his
season high of 26 points, and Walter McCarty, who had 16 points and
eight rebounds in his first feel-good game of the year. Four other
Celtics were in double figures including Vitaly Potapenko, who made
two big free throws down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   However, Potapenko was the only Celtic who did make freebies and
that almost cost them the game. Comfortably ahead throughout by as
many as 17 and by 10 with 2:12 to go, the Celtics almost ``donated
one to charity,'' as Robert Parish would say. The Wizards cut a
91-81 Boston lead to 99-98 with 12.6 seconds left thanks to four
missed free throws and some last-minute heroics by Mitch Richmond
(13 points in the fourth) and Whitney (a parabolic trey).
</P>
<P>
   McCarty then was fouled and missed both. ``They felt good,
especially the second one,'' he said. The rebound was knocked out
of bounds and the ball was awarded to Washington. Rod Strickland
(12 assists) tried to penetrate, but was cut off. He got the ball
to Whitney, whose off-balance bomb barely grazed the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to make something happen,'' said Strickland.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was surprised Boston won given the manpower
situation, Strickland said, ``We don't have any manpower either.''
Washington was without Juwan Howard (ankle) and Terry Davis (shin
bruise). Its best center all year has been 53-year-old general
manager Wes Unseld.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce was sensational in taking over the offense in the first
half, scoring 19 points. He also had five steals. But he was held
to just four shots and two hoops in the second half. The Celtics,
who shot out to a 26-9 lead in the first 10 minutes, led by 10 at
each of the first three checkpoints and by 14 after a McCarty layup
with 8:05 left.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty, Greg Minor (13 points), Potapenko (15), and Dana Barros
(11) alternated keeping the team afloat as every Wizard thrust was
met by a countering Celtics parry until the last two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to keep it interesting,'' Barros said.
</P>
<P>
   They did do that. The fourth quarter took 51 minutes to play
because of all the free throws (34) and timeouts (four by each
team). The Celtics thought they had things in hand, but should have
known better.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing an opposing coach likes to see less than
Strickland with the ball, time running out, and the game on the
line. The Hoop God smiled on the Celtics again, however.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino will take the win. He's not so sure how many more of
these finishes he can take.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Since the day she sailed her way into this city's heart
by finishing a sparkling second in the 1990 Boston Marathon, her US
debut after leaving East Germany, marathoning brought Uta Pippig
little but joy and success. Even the setbacks _ the worst being
forced to drop out of the 1996 Olympics with a leg injury _ seemed
temporary, a brief chop on life's ocean that soon would calm again
as Pippig resumed her voyage toward immortality in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   After all, how could anything swamp an athlete who earned her
third straight Boston Marathon victory, as she did at the 100th
running in 1996, by coming from nowhere in the last miles while
suffering from stomach cramps and relentless diarrhea?
</P>
<P>
   Then, last October, the 33-year-old Pippig was suspended by the
German athletic federation for failing a routine out-of-competition
drug test. Unable to compete during the suspension and facing a
two-year ban if found guilty, Pippig suddenly finds herself looking
for a lifeline to save her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't wish any person on earth this,'' said Pippig last
fall, shortly after the suspension. ``I know I didn't do anything.
It's hard. It's just not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pippig's forced exile from the roads hasn't kept the
longtime Boston favorite out of town this weekend. On Saturday,
looking fit and relaxed, she smiled for photos at the Boston
Athletic Association's annual breakfast for past champions. Monday,
as she did last year while taking what she thought would be a short
break from marathoning, she will be doing television commentary for
Channel 4.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her uncertain situation, Pippig said recently that she
was looking forward to race day. ``I can't miss it, you know,'' she
said. ``It's too special.'' The same goes for the city: ``You
should go where you feel supported.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she sighed, ``I wish I could run.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pippig's contract with Nike expired in December and
has not been renewed. (``Given that she's not racing and not able
to actually compete, there is no reason to sit down and discuss a
contract at this point,'' said Dave Mingey, a company spokesman,
who nonetheless added, ``We of course stand by Uta until her appeal
process has been exhausted.'') She is paying her own legal fees,
and already has lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in appearance
fees and likely prize money.
</P>
<P>
   And, there is no immediate end in sight. Six months after the
suspension was handed down, the commission in Germany that is
investigating her case still has not set a hearing date. If found
guilty, the three-time Boston champion and two-time Olympian could
be banned from competition for up to two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very often asking my people what is going on,'' said
Helmut Digel, president of the German federation, the Deutscher
Leichtathletik Verband, ``because this situation is for both
parties not a good one. It is very important the period of
suspension shouldn't last too long.''
</P>
<P>
   The delays may be due to questions about both science and
procedure. As in the nearly three-year-old Mary Slaney case, it is
unclear whether the test is even valid in women. (Slaney was
cleared by a USA Track &AMP; Field panel of a similar doping violation,
and filed a lawsuit last Tuesday against the United States Olympic
Committee and the International Amateur Athletic Federation,
charging negligence in handling the case.) In Pippig's case,
matters have been complicated by an unexplained switch in her two
urine samples.
</P>
<P>
   For years, rumors have swirled inside the running community
about Pippig's high training mileage and rapid recovery after
races; a training routine some fellow runners in Boulder, where she
now lives, viewed as excessively private; and her East German
background. But until last fall, Pippig never had failed any of the
dozens of drug tests in her career. (She does acknowledge that,
while still living in East Germany in 1984, she briefly took ``some
kind of drug'' that her trainer told her was vitamins, but stopped
within a few weeks after her parents, both physicians, investigated
and told her to stop.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's kind of a sad thing,'' Pippig said of the
accusations. ``But I feel sorry for them. People who say this can
be jealous.''
</P>
<P>
   The test Pippig did fail, which showed an abnormal ratio of
testosterone to epitestosterone in her urine, is by no means
universally trusted. The accepted ratio of testosterone, the male
sex hormone, to epitestosterone, an inactive metabolite that is
used as a marker, is 6 to 1; anything above that is considered to
indicate the possible use of testosterone as a
performance-enhancing anabolic steroid. But because the test cannot
distinguish naturally produced testosterone from ingested
testosterone, even a high ratio is no guarantee an athlete has
taken testosterone or androstenedione, the latter used by Mark
McGwire and legal in baseball but banned by the IAAF.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a ratio up to 10 to 1 still is considered to
be in a gray area. According to Pippig, not only was her ratio 9.2
to 1, but the abnormality was not due to high testosterone but
rather to low epitestosterone, perhaps resulting from a number of
conditions specific to gender and health issues that she has been
battling since her epic run in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm skeptical about the validity of the test, especially in
women,'' said Dr. Robert Barbieri, chief of obstetrics and
gynecology at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who has sent a letter
to the German federation on Pippig's behalf. ``This test has been
most widely used in male athletes, and then it's been applied to
females kind of by analogy. In my mind, when we finally work out
the details we will abandon it as a test for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in question, Barbieri believes, are the effects on
the t/e ratio of oral contraceptives _ which Pippig was taking at
the time _ and medical conditions involving the bowel, through
which the hormones are cycled. Pippig was hospitalized for tests
after the episode during the 1996 Marathon, and said that
intestinal problems, including diarrhea, and a severe hormone
imbalance persisted even up to the time of the drug test last
April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious I had a lot of problems with my intestinal tract
during the last years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Pippig's case, questions of procedure also have arisen. When
urine is collected for testing, samples are placed in two bottles,
marked ``A'' and ``B,'' and then placed into containers also marked
``A'' and ``B.'' After her test last April 23, said Pippig, she
placed the correct bottles into the matching containers herself,
and then she, her coach and companion Dieter Hogen, and the test
controller all signed to confirm the protocol was done correctly.
But when the ``A'' container was opened April 29 in a German
laboratory, said Pippig, the ``B'' sample was found inside,
leaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federation said, `It must have been you,' '' said Pippig.
``But . . . when a controller comes you do everything very clear
and slow. Six eyes who look to the same bottle, the same container,
the same paper . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no mistake in our home,'' insisted Hogen.
</P>
<P>
   And none by the federation, insisted Digel. ``We got the
information that the test was positive, and that is why we made our
decision to suspend,'' he said. ``We are not responsible for the
collection of the sample, not responsible for the containers, not
responsible for the transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   If mistakes were made in the lab, Digel said, it is the lab's
responsibility, not the federation's.
</P>
<P>
   Where does this leave Pippig?
</P>
<P>
   ``If this (the reversal of the samples and the subsequent
testing of them in the wrong order, according to international
rules) is fact, it would be very hard to prosecute this case,''
said Dr. Gary I. Wadler, an associate professor of medicine at New
York University School of Medicine and lead author of the textbook
``Drugs and the Athlete.'' ``If all these things can be proved,
case closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the case is not yet closed, and so at noon Monday Pippig
will be on TV rather than the starting line. Still, she remains
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence shows I'm not guilty,'' she said. ``I will run
again. Nothing will change for me.''

IN CHESS GAME, PATRIOTS MAKE NICE BISHOP MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Drew Bledsoe isn't in danger of losing his
starting job in the immediate future, but the Patriots drafted
young quarterback Michael Bishop Sunday. He runs, he's mobile, and
he's the second black quarterback ever drafted by the franchise.
(Jay Walker was the first).
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Heisman Trophy runner-up Bishop, a
6-foot-1-inch, 200-pounder, in the seventh round highlighted the
Patriots' second day of the NFL draft. New England, which was
without a fourth-round pick, selected Baylor offensive lineman
Derrick Fletcher in the fifth round, Colorado defensive back Marcus
Washington in the sixth, and Bishop and Brown receiver Sean Morey
in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why a Heisman runner-up would slip to the final round,
Bishop said, ``I'm not concerned about what other people think
about that. There are a lot of great players taken in the later
rounds, and I appreciate the chance to do it for the Patriots.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, who runs a 4.71 40-yard dash, will not have an offense
designed to take advantage of his skills, but coach Pete Carroll
said if the team has to use him, he will bring unique talents to
the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a chance to bring a change of pace to our quarterback
game,'' said Carroll. ``If you've watched Kansas State games you
can see the great offense they built around him and all of the
things he can do. He has tremendous arm strength, he can run, and
he can scramble and use the whole field.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said he would not use Bishop as the Pittsburgh Steelers
used Kordell Stewart early in his career as a third-down
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't use him like that, but when he has the chance to play
he'll bring some unique aspects to our game,'' said Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, one of several black quarterbacks drafted, including
Donovan McNabb No. 2 overall and Akili Smith No. 3, said, ``You
look at the whole college level and it means a lot to get the
opportunity to show the nation and the world how many great black
college quarterbacks there are.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop said he thinks he had the versatility to catch passes,
play safety, or run with the ball, but the Patriots don't have
those plans for him. They want him to spend this season learning
the system.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher, 6-6 1/2, 374 pounds, is considered a physical wonder.
He runs a 5.25 40, which makes him one of the quickest offensive
linemen in college football. He may have lasted until the fifth
round because there is some question about his consistency and
effort.
</P>
<P>
   There's also some question as to whether he's a guard or a
tackle. He played both at Baylor, last year seeing all of his
action at tackle, but the Patriots are looking at him as a guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has big upside,'' said Carroll. Fletcher is a former
defensive lineman who was a part-time nose tackle in his first two
years until moving to offense his junior year.
</P>
<P>
   The problem? Fletcher has some trouble controlling his weight.
He said his ideal playing weight is 340 or less, but when asked his
current weight he said he weighed 370.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weight is not a problem,'' insisted the physical education and
health major. ``I know I can shed the weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher says he's an excellent run blocker and believes his
main attributes are ``power and quickness. I think I'm a smart
player. I analyze and think a lot to help myself and my
teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher said he was at first apprehensive about his move to
offense two years ago, but is now glad he made the switch. He said
a coaching change at Baylor led to the change.
</P>
<P>
   At the scouting combine in Indianapolis, Fletcher was very
impressive with his 40 times. But on his second attempt he pulled a
hamstring. Fletcher said he's just about recovered and is now able
to run.
</P>
<P>
   With No. 1 pick Damien Woody, a center, the Patriots may be
pushing veterans Todd Rucci and Zefross Moss, who have big
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, the 180th player taken, played cornerback and free
safety at Colorado and it appears as if he'll be a free safety.
That gives the Patriots two young free safety types; they also
drafted Florida's Tony George, and that may not bode well for
incumbent backup Chris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, a shade under 6-2 and 220 pounds, started two games
at corner and seven at free safety. He has decent speed, and is an
aggressive player who can bump at the line of scrimmage, but it
doesn't appear he'll challenge Steve Israel, Chris Canty, or
Tebucky Jones for playing time.
</P>
<P>
   He is in a decent position, however, since Willie Clay is in the
final year of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see an opportunty for myself no matter where I was drafted
because I think I'm a pretty good player,'' said Washington, who
once roomed with Patriots linebacker Ron Merkerson with the
Buffaloes. ``I'm not a one-dimensional player. I can go out there
and play anywhere in the secondary. I love to play. Anywhere I
would have ended up, I see an opportunity for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington said he didn't have any contact with the Patriots
after the combine, ``but I had a great meeting with Coach Carroll
at the combine and I can't wait to wear the red, white and blue. I
can't wait to see Mr. Bledsoe again. His younger brother (Adam)
plays at Colorado. He and I are pretty good friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have liked Morey for the past couple of years. He
worked out for New England two weeks ago and Carroll came away with
the feeling he'd like to have him around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings an obvious attitude about the game,'' said Carroll.
``He has a real knack for adjusting back on balls. We'll use him on
special teams and then see what he can do as he learns the
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Morey, who originally wanted to go to Boston College, said ``I'm
going to do whatever it takes to do the things the Patriots want me
to do. I've worked with the same speed coach (Mike Morris) they
have, so I understand some of the things they emphasize.''
</P>
<P>
   Morey said he dreamed of a chance to play for the Patriots, but
he didn't know whether he'd be drafted or signed after the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was confident to get an opportunity to play,'' he said. ``I
knew I had a chance to be drafted and I knew I'd get a chance
either way. I have a lot of goals and aspirations for this game and
this is the start of it.''

SAMUEL, AZUMAH BEAR UP WELL 
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-NEW ENGLAND-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ When the NFL draft entered its second and
final day on Sunday, Mark Hatley, the director of pro personnel for
the Chicago Bears, said it was his team's intention to stock its
roster with the best athletes available.
</P>
<P>
   By the fifth round, Hatley adhered to that
best-athlete-available theory when the Bears landed two of the best
the Atlantic 10 Conference had to offer: University of
Massachusetts linebacker Khari Samuel, who was selected with the
144th pick, and University of New Hampshire running back Jerry
Azumah, who was taken three picks later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, it definitely is,'' said Samuel, who was a
defensive ringleader of the Minutemen's national championship team
last season. ``But it's good, too. A couple of small-school guys
are going to be up there watching each other's back. I feel good
about that also. He grew up in Worcester and I grew up in
Framingham; we're two Massachusetts guys, so it's going to be a
good situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Massachusetts native son, Marc Megna of Fall River,
became the third A-10 player selected when he was taken in the
sixth round by the New York Jets with the 183d pick. Megna was a
linebacker at Richmond. Rounding out the New England selections was
Sean Morey of Brown, who won't be going very far to try his hand
professionally, because the Patriots drafted him in the seventh
round (see Patriots' story, Page D13).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited about it (being selected), because it's been
a dream of mine ever since high school to be able to play
professional football,'' said Megna, who was overlooked in high
school and received only one scholarship offer. Last season the
6-foot-3-inch, 255-pounder was recognized as Defensive Player of
the Year. ``Coach (Jim) Reid was the only one who gave me a chance,
and I'm so grateful that he did,'' said Megna. ``Now I'll have a
chance to play for a Bill Parcells, who's one of the most
respected, if not the most respected, coach in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   To Azumah, a 5-10, 198-pounder who rushed for 2,282 yards and 22
TDs last season to win the Walter Payton Award as the nation's best
Division 1-AA player, it was ironic he wound up with the Bears,
where Payton began and ended his Hall of Fame career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a little coincidence, but to me it's a nice
fit,'' said Azumah, who wowed scouts at the NFL combine with his
speed and 43-inch vertical leap. ``I'm just glad I'll be getting
the opportunity. I'm just kind of speechless right now. I just want
to take full advantage of it and whatever happens happens, so
hopefully good things will happen. I'm not sure exactly where they
want me to play yet.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some speculation that, because of Azumah's
athleticism, he might be a better pro prospect at cornerback. And
while he was not totally opposed to the idea, he did indicate,
``I've never played the position before, so I'm inexperienced at
that. At (New Hampshire), I never ran backwards a day in my life,
so it's going to be something new, but I'm sure I'll adjust if they
need me to.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had talked to the Bears about the possibility of
playing running back, Azumah said, ``I haven't talked to them
specifically about that. Today was a day where we talked about
flight reservations and things like that, because we'll be coming
in this weekend. I'm not exactly sure what's going to happen, but
I'll find out when I get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty sure they'll give me that chance (to run the
football),'' he added. ``It's what I did best in college.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the 6-2, 242-pound Samuel? His strongest suit in college
was his toughness and his ability to play from sideline to
sideline, which has been a hallmark of the Bears' long and
illustrious line of linebackers. ``Definitely, and that's another
reason why I like the situation,'' he said. ``I'm proud to be able
to go there and to experience that. I'm really, really excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it will help to have a familiar face in Azumah. Asked
if he had any messages for the New Hampshire star, Samuel laughed
and said, ``See you in Chicago.''

PATRIOTS' PROBLEMS MULTIPLY 
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-AFC EAST-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Throughout an interminably long offseason,
nothing good happened to the New England Patriots. While the Miami
Dolphins, New York Jets, and Indianapolis Colts kept improving with
free agent signings, the best the Patriots could do was stand pat.
Unfortunately, they couldn't even manage that for long.
</P>
<P>
   Fate and finances entered into the AFC East equation and New
England lost center Dave Wohlabaugh to the expansion Browns and
punter Tom Tupa to the hated Jets, and, in the cruelest blow,
running back Robert Edwards went involuntarily into civilian life
with a likely career-ending knee injury only a month after
completing a rookie year in which he rushed for more than 1,000
yards.
</P>
<P>
   With everyone else in the hyper-competitive AFC East improving
one way or another, New England's hydra-headed braintrust of Pete
Carroll, Bobby Grier, Andy Wasynczuk, and Bob Kraft couldn't wait
for Draft Day to come because, with two first-round choices and 11
picks overall, it was at last a chance to do SOMETHING.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two days, they succeeded in that. Unfortunately
for them, so did the Colts, Dolphins, Bills, and maybe even the
Jets, which leaves New England improved but facing a divisional
landscape greatly altered in an uphill way since the end of last
season. Here is a look at how all five teams fared:
</P>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Nobody in the division has improved more, but
that figured because the Colts had the furthest to go. Yet general
manager Bill Polian took a major gamble the week of the draft by
unloading three-time Pro Bowl running back Marshall Faulk and then
bypassing Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams in favor of Miami's
Edgerrin James.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk was coming off the best year of his career, rushing for
1,319 yards and catching 88 passes for another 908, but he created
bad blood with Polian by claiming late last season to have found a
contractual loophole that would make him a free agent if he
finished among the league's top five rushers.
</P>
<P>
   Polian disputed that and got his legendary dander up. Although
it became a moot point when Faulk fell 13 yards short, when he
continued to talk of renegotiating with two years left on his
contract, Polian traded him. Then he shocked the draft world by
taking James, who was rated on par with Williams by many but
started only 17 college games while Williams rushed for more than
6,200 yards at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Polian liked James's pass-catching skills and believed he was a
better fit for the Colts' offensive approach than the power-running
Williams, who had averaged seven fumbles a year at Texas. If James
fills Faulk's shoes, this was a bold move. If Faulk shines in St.
Louis and Williams becomes the next Earl Campbell in New Orleans,
Polian never will live it down.
</P>
<P>
   After taking James, Polian continued the rebuilding of one of
the worst defenses in football, grabbing tackling machine
linebacker Mike Peterson on the second round. Every scout who went
to Florida to watch Jevon Kearse came away noticing Peterson made
more plays even though he is only 224 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Guard prospect Brandon Burlsworth followed, and he could compete
for a starting job this season. After that third-round selection,
the draft becomes a crapshoot, but the landing of Peterson in
particular adds help and production where Indianapolis needed it
most. Added to free agents Chad Bratzke (defensive end with 11
sacks for the Giants last season), Shawn King (defensive end),
Cornelius Bennett (linebacker), and Chad Cota (safety), it means an
entirely revamped defensive look for the Colts, and they needed
one.
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Jimmy Johnson wanted one thing out of this draft and he
got it: a power running game.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins artfully traded down twice to get out of the first
round and still landed three of the draft's top half-dozen backs,
getting James Johnson and Syracuse fullback Rob Konrad at the top
of the second round and Cecil Collins in the fifth plus a total of
1,600 pounds of new offensive firepower.
</P>
<P>
   First they grabbed Johnson, a back the Patriots coveted, then
the 251-pound Konrad, the top-rated fullback, and finally the
troubled but vastly talented Collins, who could become a superstar
or a car wreck. All can catch the ball out of the backfield, and
any one could solve a major problem in Miami. A year ago, the
Dolphins were the worst short-yardage team in football, and that
caught up with them several times in close games. Johnson had to do
something about it and he did, adding three big runners with
potential and 300-pound No. 3 pick Grey Ruegamer.
</P>
<P>
   When you add that tonnage to Johnson's offseason acquisitions,
you get a lot of suet. Johnson previously signed 330-pound free
agent guard Kevin Gogan, 240-pound fullback Roosevelt Potts,
234-pound back Tyrone Wheatley, and 250-pound tight end Hunter
Goodwin. Add another 1,600 pounds on draft day and it's a load. If
Johnson and Konrad are more successful in short yardage than Karim
Abdul-Jabbar and John Avery, the Dolphins have the look of a
contender. If Collins pans out, they're more dangerous than that.
</P>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ Like New England, the Bills had to wait until the
draft to add anything of note, and when their time came they got
exactly the player they wanted in Ohio State cornerback Antoine
Winfield.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the other stars on the Buckeyes, Winfield was the
team's MVP and the winner of the Jim Thorpe Award as the nation's
No. 1 collegiate defensive back. Champ Bailey and Chris McAlister
were both rated ahead of Winfield by pro scouts because Winfield is
only 5 feet 9 inches, but the Bills like shorter, quicker defensive
backs and they got one who not only can cover but willingly knocks
your block off in run support.
</P>
<P>
   General manager John Butler then might have gotten one of the
best bargains in the draft in Tennessee wide receiver Peerless
Price on the second round. With Quinn Early gone and Andre Reed
beginning to age, Price will have an opportunity to step in and
contribute and he may have the skill and hands to do it. Some
scouts questioned him because he often seems off balance, but he
made his biggest plays in Tennessee's biggest games.
</P>
<P>
   After that, things slowed down in Buffalo, but the Bills didn't
need much to improve. Winfield shores up a weakness in the
secondary and Price gives them depth where only Reed and Eric
Moulds were productive. Add to that the fact Buffalo has the best
quarterback situation in the division with Doug Flutie and Rob
Johnson, and the Bills seem as sound as a year ago. If Price pays
off, they'll be more than that.
</P>
<P>
   NY JETS _ The Jets finally finished paying off the ransom for
Bill Parcells, which meant they had no No. 1 pick and not much
chance to improve themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that, Parcells was very active in free agency, adding
eight-time Pro Bowl safety Steve Atwater, solid run-stuffing
linebacker Roman Phifer, punter Tom Tupa, and 280-pound tight end
Eric Green. Green's bulk gives the Jets another tackle on the
field, for all intents and purposes, and Parcells tried to add to
that by drafting guard prospects Randy Thomas and David Loverne
with second- and third-round choices. Thomas is more of a finesse
player than Parcells would like, but at 300-plus pounds he won't be
for long.
</P>
<P>
   If Thomas or Loverne start at guard, Parcells will have done all
he could with a draft that left him few options but to watch for
too long.
</P>
<P>
   NEW ENGLAND _ Stymied by salary cap problems and bad luck, the
Patriots couldn't do much to help themselves until this weekend and
they succeeded, even though they couldn't swing a trade to get
James or Williams.
</P>
<P>
   They managed first to replace departed center Dave Wohlabaugh
with the one guy scouts say is capable of stepping in and starting
at center this year, Boston College's Damien Woody. They traded up
three spots to do it, and whether that was necessary or not is moot
because they didn't want all 11 picks anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Woody has to play immediately for this to really pay off, and
New England is counting on that. If he does, the Patriots move
Heath Irwin to right guard, Max Lane to right tackle, and improve a
line that looked like a weak link after Wohlabaugh left.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of tiny LSU runner Kevin Faulk on the second round
gives them a third-down back who has shown he can catch the ball,
which is important in Ernie Zampese's offense. Whether he is an
every-down back who can replace Edwards is questionable, but New
England signed veteran backup Lamont Warren Saturday as insurance
and likely will sign another veteran in June, after teams release
players for salary cap relief.
</P>
<P>
   Florida safety Tony George, a third-round pick, was another
``just in case'' kind of move. He has played both corner and safety
but is projected as the latter and will be groomed to possibly
replace veteran Willie Clay, who will be a free agent at the end of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   New England may have gotten lucky or may have made a huge
blunder with the final Parcells Pick, however, taking Ohio State
linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer with the No. 28 pick. If Katzenmoyer
plays the way he did his first two years at OSU, he'll be a major
addition. If he plays the way he did last year, he won't play much.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are banking on the former, believing Katzenmoyer's
production was affected by the off-field controversy over his
questionable academic performance and a change in the way he was
asked to attack the line of scrimmage. He was considered a top-10
pick just a year ago and still has the size, speed, and strength to
justify those opinions. All he has to do is play up to his physical
gifts and he'll start at weak-side linebacker next to Ted Johnson,
which is why this pick was made.
</P>
<P>
   With Todd Collins gone, New England kept insisting Tedy Bruschi
could step in full-time even though he showed when he had to last
year he couldn't hold up. He is an undersized role player who can
be productive in the right situation. The right situation is not
playing every down. Enter Katzenmoyer.
</P>
<P>
   If Woody and Katzenmoyer start and Faulk plays effectively
enough to keep Edwards's name out of the papers while he's in
street clothes, this will have been the draft Grier was hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   Of the five teams, Indianapolis took the biggest Draft Day
gamble, the Jets did the least, Buffalo improved, and Miami found a
new set of widebodies with which to try and create a running game
Jimmy Johnson can be proud of. But the team that may have done the
most was the Patriots. Whether it was enough to counter all the
other moves by their division rivals is a matter to be decided on
another day.

 U.S. APPAREL COMPANIES STARTING TO CUT DOWN ON ABUSES  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Prodded by controversy over exploitation in the
foreign factories that make much of America's clothes and shoes,
major corporations and universities have turned the tables by
pushing for sweatshop reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Nike and Reebok, long the targets of criticism, are now raising
their foreign wages, improving working conditions and defending
human-rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of universities nationwide have jumped on the bandwagon,
reacting to a growing student protest movement by taking steps to
bar labor abuses in the manufacture of clothes that bear college
logos.
</P>
<P>
   The moves have boosted a new White House-sponsored alliance, the
Fair Labor Association, which its backers say is the only feasible
way to raise standards in the complex factory networks that now
form the core of global free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not surprisingly, all these changes have produced yet
more controversy. Some anti-sweatshop activists call them cynical
attempts to prevent real reform, while many corporations view them
as liberal meddling in the boardroom. But either way, the
initiatives may have a lasting effect on the U.S. public debate
over foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the changes have come in a rush, including the
following:
</P>
<P>
   --Wages. Nike and Reebok have raised wages and benefits in their
Indonesian footwear factories, which employ a total of more than
100,000 workers, making base compensation 43 percent higher than
the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   --Working conditions. Nike is cooperating with independent
monitors to end health and safety problems at its 37 shoe factories
in Vietnam and other nations. Dara O'Rourke, a Berkeley expert who
embarrassed Nike in 1997 with a highly publicized expose of one of
its Vietnam factories, revisited the plant and issued a report last
month March  &LR; verifying major improvements.
</P>
<P>
   --Human rights. Reebok and Nike have taken unprecedented steps
to defend labor rights activists who have long been their
adversaries. In January, Reebok sent a letter to Indonesian
President B.J. Habibie urging the release of imprisoned labor
leader Dita Sari. Last month, Nike publicly repudiated a top
executive, Vice President Joseph Ha, after he criticized Vietnam
labor activists _ criticism that in previous years would have been
considered routine.
</P>
<P>
   --Fair Labor Association. Fifty-six universities, including the
seven Ivy League schools, the University of Southern California,
Santa Clara University and California State University at
Sacramento, have joined the FLA, a White House-sponsored alliance
of human rights groups and corporations such as Nike, Reebok, Liz
Claiborne and Phillips-Van Heusen that is setting up an elaborate,
worldwide factory monitoring system to try to eliminate sweatshop
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   --Youth initiative. Nike, Mattel, the World Bank and the
Baltimore-based International Youth Foundation have founded the
Global Alliance for Workers and Communities, a vaguely defined, $10
million project to ``enhance the lives'' of young workers in
clothing, toy and athletic footwear factories in Indonesia,
Thailand, China and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime critics say these steps leave much to be desired. For
example, the Indonesia wage raises by Nike and Reebok put total
minimum compensation at only 20 U.S. cents an hour, less than what
is needed to support a family and well below the 27 cents per hour
that Nike paid until Indonesia's currency devaluations and economic
crisis began two years ago. But the moves are a good start, the
critics say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that industry leaders are taking these new steps, as
insufficient as they are, is because so much public pressure has
been put on them,'' said Medea Benjamin, co-director of Global
Exchange, a San Francisco group that has spearheaded a nationwide
campaign against Nike in recent years. ``It's a sign of real
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The FLA was formed in November after three years of organizing
and arm-twisting by the Clinton administration. Its rules for
member companies' foreign factories include the freedom to organize
unions and bans on child labor, forced or prison labor, and
physical abuse by supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   By 2001, after its monitoring system has been operating for a
year, participating companies will be able to use the FLA logo on
their labels and in their advertising, helping portray the firms as
cutting-edge, ethical corporate citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Ethics-minded consumers, in turn, will be able to look for the
FLA logo while shopping to guarantee that what they buy is free of
moral stigma.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FLA isn't perfect, but it's a move in the right direction,
and the important thing is that it's on the ground and it exists,''
said Maria Eitel, a Nike vice president who is in charge of the
company's reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Eitel applauded the 56 universities' decisions to join the FLA.
In fact, Nike had pressured the universities to join the FLA, which
the company apparently sees as a means of helping its bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Nike and Reebok saw their profits fall 37 percent and
65 percent, respectively. Company executives blame the drop mainly
on the overall slump in U.S. athletic footwear sales, which fell an
estimated 9 percent, but also on negative publicity from the
sweatshop controversy. Company executives now hope the FLA logo
will improve their products' image and boost sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Footwear and apparel are incredibly competitive industries,
but strengthening the FLA and making it viable will help us, too,''
Eitel said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the FLA's emphasis on foreign exploitation, sweatshops
remain alive and well in the United States. They were prevalent in
the U.S. garment and footwear industry until around World War II,
when pressure from social reformers, union organizing and new
federal wage-and-hour laws caused dramatic improvements in working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But by the 1990s, increasing competition brought by free trade
created a new system of contractors and subcontractors at home and
abroad _ mainly in Mexico and Southeast Asia _ that undermined
wages and working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The apparel industry, with annual U.S. retail sales of $70
billion, and the footwear industry, with $36 billion, now make only
45 percent and 7 percent, respectively, of their products in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, U.S. Department of Labor inspections of garment
contractors found violations of wage-and-hours laws at 61 percent
of factories in Los Angeles and at 63 percent of factories in New
York, the nation's two largest garment centers. (In the Bay Area,
however, where local garment firms have cooperated with federal
regulators, the rate of violations was only 13 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the apparel and footwear industries may be too
complicated and politically powerful to be fully reformed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are powerful, intractable economic forces at work in the
sweatshop issue,'' said John Dunlop, a Harvard professor who was
secretary of labor under President Gerald Ford. ``If we can't
eradicate sweatshops and child labor at home, how do you think
we're going to do it for Indonesia or Bangladesh?''
</P>
<P>
   In Sacramento, some lawmakers are trying to reform California's
own sweatshops. A major labor-law reform bill, sponsored by
Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, would make garment
manufacturers and retailers with their own fashion labels jointly
liable for labor violations at their contractors' factories.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is backed by labor unions and by Latino and
Asian-American organizations. But it is opposed by the apparel
industry and by major retail stores, which are big campaign donors
to Republicans and Democrats alike.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation was vetoed in 1990 by Governor George
Deukmejian and in 1992 and 1994 by Governor Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Ilse Metchek, executive director of the California Fashion
Association, an industry group in Los Angeles, warned that this
year's bill would cause garment manufacturers to move to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this bill passes, it would drive the industry out of the
state,'' she said. ``It would create unlimited civil liability for
real and imagined labor violations. It would be a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill cleared a key hurdle April 7 winning approval by the
Assembly Committee on Labor and Employment on a 6-to-2, party-line
vote, with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed. It now goes
to the Assembly Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Activists say the overall reform process will be long and
complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweatshops were eradicated once in the United States through
decades of organizing and passing legislation,'' Benjamin said.
``It will take a protracted struggle _ a global one this time _ to
eradicate this new wave of sweatshops.''

 7 WIN TOP ENVIRONMENTAL PRIZE
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By GLEN MARTIN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ A Burmese activist who publicized human
rights abuses and rain forest destruction in Southeast Asia and a
Newfoundland commercial fisherman who campaigned against the
overexploitation of global fisheries are among the seven recipients
of the 1999 Goldman Environmental Prize, the world's most
prestigious environmental award.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the winners _ collectively representing six continents _
will receive $125,000, with the exception of two co-recipients from
Australia, who will share a prize.
</P>
<P>
   The prize is awarded annually by the Goldman Environmental
Foundation, a San Francisco organization devoted to grassroots
environmental activism.
</P>
<P>
   The award was established in 1989 by philanthropists Richard and
Rhoda Goldman. Winners are selected from anonymous nominations
submitted by 21 environmental organizations and a confidential
panel of consultants representing 50 countries.
</P>
<P>
   One of the winners is Ka Hsaw Wa, 28, a member of Burma's
minority Karen community who has spent several years hiding in the
rain forests of Burma and Thailand documenting human rights abuses
and environmental destruction reportedly conducted by members of
Burma's military junta.
</P>
<P>
   Ka Hsaw Wa _ meaning White Elephant in Burmese _ is a nom de
guerre for the prizewinner, adopted because he fears reprisals from
government authorities if he uses his real name.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested and tortured for three days by soldiers in 1988
when he joined massive student protests against military rule in
Burma. The demonstrations ended in a bloody crackdown, and Ka Hsaw
Wa fled to the forests near the Thai border.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has led an incognito existence, reporting on the
plight of indigenous people who say they have suffered abuses
ranging from expulsion to murder of family members by soldiers in
the employ of logging and petroleum companies. He said
international corporations are decimating Burma's pristine forests
and abundant wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terribly sad,'' he said. ``We've found tigers that have
either been shot by the soldiers or killed by land mines.''
</P>
<P>
   He will provide testimony next year in a U.S. District Court
case charging Unocal and other companies with human rights and
environmental abuses in a gas pipeline construction project
traversing Thailand and Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian commercial fisherman Bernard Martin, 45, won a prize
for founding an organization of family fishers opposing large
``factory'' trawlers.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a fourth-generation fisherman, predicted the collapse of
the Grand Banks cod fishery several years before it occurred in
1992, a situation widely blamed on ``strip mining'' of the sea
floor by huge trawlers of the international fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Martin has been travelling the world advising other
communities on fisheries conservation.
</P>
<P>
   He is also working on programs designed to reduce the threat of
``ghost nets'' _ lost or abandoned gill nets that float the seas,
entangling and killing marine creatures indiscriminately.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said Canadian cod stocks are slowly recovering thanks to
tough regulations, but that other species are now subjected to
excessive pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is still allowing the overfishing of capelin, a
small fish popular in Japan but critical as a food source to a wide
variety of commercial and sport fish, including cod and Atlantic
salmon,'' he said. ``The problem isn't the small, inshore line or
seine fleets _ it's the huge deep-sea trawlers. They're a
scourge.''
</P>
<P>
   The other winners are:
</P>
<P>
   _Jacqui Katona, 33, and Yvonne Margarula, 41, two Australian
aboriginal women who have led a fight against the mining of a huge
uranium deposit surrounded by Kakadu National Park, the country's
largest park and a United Nations-designated World Heritage Site.
The mine is located on lands owned for millennia by the Mirrar
aboriginal people.
</P>
<P>
   Katona said the battle against the mine has been tough, but that
it has galvanized the country's aborigines and environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say to fight on, win or lose,'' she said. ``It's about
our heritage and our integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   _Samuel Nguiffo, a Cameroon lawyer who is fighting in his
country's courts to stop the liquidation of the world's
second-largest contiguous rain forest and the slaughter of
chimpanzees and other rare wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Nguiffo travels Cameroon's forests to keep indigenous tribes
apprised of their rights, and he is trying to obtain guarantees
from the Cameroon government that a planned oil pipeline from Chad
won't result in increased logging, social dislocation and marine
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to understand that many of the trees that are
targeted by loggers are terribly important to villagers for food,
building materials and even as sacred sites,'' he said. ``Their
traditional value essentially supersedes their commercial value.''
</P>
<P>
   _Jorge Varela, a Honduran conservationist who is successfully
fighting destructive shrimp farming practices in Honduras' Gulf of
Fonseca.
</P>
<P>
   Once one of the richest fishing grounds in Central America, the
Gulf has lost much of its biodiversity because shrimp farmers have
stripped it of mangrove forests, which serve as nurseries for a
wide array of species.
</P>
<P>
   Varela formed a conservation group that successfully pressured
the Honduran government to institute a moratorium on new shrimp
farms, form an oversight agency for the industry and establish fish
and wildlife refuges on some of the Gulf's lagoons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a worldwide problem,'' he said. ``Industrial shrimp
are cheap to buy, but they come at tremendous environmental cost.
The real price is too much to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   _Michal Kravcik, a Slovakian hydrologist who successfully fought
a government plan to build a large dam on the Upper Torysa River to
provide drinking water for East Slovakia's cities. The dam would
have forced the evacuation of four villages.
</P>
<P>
   Kravcik gained widespread grassroots support by promoting an
alternative plan that relied on ``microbasins'' and a series of
weirs and small dams. As a result of local opposition, the
government cancelled plans for the Torysa River dam in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now working on a sustainable development program for 24
villages,'' said Kravcik. ``We have a new prime minister who is
sympathetic to us. The main problem is turning around some of the
old bureaucrats who are still in place.''  &LR;

villages,'' said Kravcik. ``We have a new prime minister who is
sympathetic to us. The main problem is turning around some of the
old bureaucrats who are still in place.''  &LR;

 HOSPITALS SAY THEY CAN BEAT THE MILLENNIUM BUG  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Despite some frightful warnings from Y2K
watchdogs, hospitals and other health services nationwide claim
they will be ready for nearly anything their computers might throw
at them January 1.
<P>
   Nobody can predict just what will happen when the calendar rolls
over to 2000. Archaic bits of date-deficient software often are
deeply embedded in computer systems, raising fears of cascading
shutdowns even if there's no outward sign of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The fears were not helped by a recent congressional review of
Y2K preparedness, which found that the health industry was woefully
behind in the race to search out and neutralize Y2K bugs.
Investigators plan  &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
c,12p2  &LR; to take a fresh look next month.
</P>
<P>
   But Fred Brown, chairman of the American Hospital Association,
offered assurances that the critical systems _ those that could
directly affect patient care _ will be bug-free in time.
</P>
<P>
   After a nationwide survey of hospitals last month, the trade
group concluded that only a tiny  &LR; fraction of mostly smaller
hospitals feared any serious Y2K meltdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Even if something does happen, all hospitals already are
required to have elaborate contingency plans, including backup
power generators, for any emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything to do with patient care certainly will be ready,''
Brown said. ``I'd be very comfortable being a patient on January
1.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals alone will have spent at least $8.2 billion on the Y2K
problem by the end of the year, according to the trade association.
In California, about $820 million is being spent to identify and
fix suspect computer systems and devices.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Permanente, the Oakland-based HMO giant that provides
health care to about one in three Northern Californians, has about
1,000 employees, contractors and consultants working on Y2K
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Crews have had to deal with 139,000 pieces of medical equipment.
Some 4,200 had date-related coding problems and were either patched
with up-to-date software or junked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, everything is on track'' to be finished by year's
end, Kaiser spokesman Tom Debley said.
</P>
<P>
   Industrywide, most experts see little cause for alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of dates are simply used for
record-keeping,'' said Allen Falcon, president of a Boston-based
technology consulting firm, Horizon Information Group, which has
produced a Y2K guide for small businesses. ``Pacemakers stopping,
microwave ovens exploding, elevators skyrocketing to the top of the
shaft _ these things just aren't going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such reassurances, no one offers any absolute
guarantees. And some analysts insist that patients are not yet safe
from malfunctioning microchips.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Ackerman, executive director of Rx2000 Solutions Institute,
a nonprofit research organization based in Minneapolis, said
medical devices seem to have fewer Y2K problems than expected even
six months ago, but questions remain about drug manufacturing and
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a lot of risk out there,'' he said. ``I think
there will be some patients hurt by Y2K problems. Even if it's only
one computer chip in 1,000, or one in 10,000, or even one in
100,000,'' someone will be affected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, devices that are Y2K compliant could malfunction
when networked with other devices, particularly if they use
different technical strategies for handling dates.
</P>
<P>
   Some problems may take months or even years to reveal &LR; 
themselves. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  And not every hospital can afford to test every device in
every conceivable situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are thousands of computer chips in every hospital,''
said Lori Aldrete, senior vice president at the California
Healthcare Association, a group of hospitals and health-care
networks. ``Even if a vendor tells you a particular model is Y2K
compliant, without testing each piece of equipment you really don't
know for sure. So it's been a huge job.''
</P>
<P>
   The much-feared millennium bug stems from software set up to
record dates in two-digit format only, such as ``76'' for the year
1976. Unless fixed, such programs can't distinguish 2000 from 1900.
</P>
<P>
   The list of imagined consequences reads like an excerpt from a
disaster-movie script: Cancer patients blasted with the wrong
dosage of radiation. Surgeons unable to rely on diagnostic
scanners. Ambulances sent to the wrong address.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts say most such scenarios seem fanciful. ``There's
a lot of hype,'' said Dr. Vincent Riccardi, president of American
Medical Consumers Inc., a nonprofit health-advisory organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear to me that all these concerns are &LR; 
legitimate.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  If problems do occur, they are likely to be more annoying than
life-threatening, many experts say. A hospital elevator's automated
control system may shut down because it wrongly concludes that
service is 1,000 or so years overdue. Or, someone's medical bill
may be delayed or contain an error.
</P>
<P>
   Still, observers like Ackerman point to serious potential &LR; 
problems. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   , some involving interactions among different devices and &LR; 
computer systems. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   , often not from the same manufacturer. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Machines with more serious repercussions are being examined
for possible glitches, including bedside monitors that feed
information to nurses' stations; MRI units hooked to laser imagers;
terminals for ordering drugs that are drug-ordering &LR; 
terminals &LR; wired into central pharmacies; and hospital laboratory
computers that receive test results from outside labs.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller facilities tend to be the least prepared, hampered by &LR; 
tight budgets and less experienced in-house computer staff. But &LR; 
they also have the advantage of less technology-intensive &LR; 
operations _ and thus fewer things that can go wrong. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Tiny Surprise Valley Community Hospital in Modoc County, for &LR; 
example, does no high-tech diagnostic scanning, does no &LR;  surgeries
under general anesthesia and sends out most blood and &LR;  tissue
samples for analysis. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty much no-frills,'' said hospital administrator &LR; 
Joyce Gysin, adding that her staff tested all the hospital's own &LR; 
lab equipment and found no sign of any Y2K bugs lurking. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Suppliers, which stand to be liable should any preventable
problems occur, have shouldered much of the Y2K testing burden.
</P>
<P>
   Medtronic Inc., one of the nation's biggest medical-technology
companies, began checking its products in 1997 and found seven
product lines with Y2K-related problems that had to be fixed. as
well as software that would fix them. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  But  &LR; The most serious, according to Medtronic Y2K overseer
Mike Bars-ness, was a monitor that couldn't upload data properly if
it were running during the transition from December 31 to January
1. None of the errors were deemed critical to the safe operation of
any devices.
</P>
<P>
   Fear may turn out to be one of the biggest dangers _ and one
that can't be readily fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Y2K sites are warning of widespread breakdowns in
transportation and communications networks that hospitals rely on
to get drug shipments.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies, meanwhile, are warning customers not to hoard
drugs, which they say could pose a bigger threat to the medical
supply system than computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman disputes this reasoning. Not all dangers have been
addressed: There are ``many points of potential failure'' in the
system, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the risks, the state Office of Emergency Services, the Red
Cross and other agencies are advising consumers to make hard copies
of their medical records and prepare for the possibility that
prescriptions won't get refilled for a time after New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   The issue will be debated _ and worked on _ for months to come.
The Veterans Administration, for example, sent formal requests for
Y2K-compliance details to 1,600 suppliers, posting the replies and
other materials on the Internet. Many of the devices with
compliance problems are still being fixed, but readiness is
expected by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The workload is achievable,'' said Leonard Bourget, the VA
system's Y2K project manager.
</P>
<P>
   After repeated rounds of surveys, fixes and follow-ups, FDA
officials say they, too, are confident that Y2K malfunctions won't
wreak havoc.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of medical devices turned up with problems,
including some older electrocardiogram machines and other equipment
that printed out incorrect dates.
</P>
<P>
   The most critical technology _ such as pacemakers and other
implanted devices _ should function properly regardless of the
date, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   `'The defibrillator may show a wrong date,'' Falcon said. ``So
what? It will still bring the patient back to life. It will just
say that it brought him back in a different century.''

 A MOVEMENT AT NATION'S SCHOOLS TO FIGHT SWEATSHOPS  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In recent months, a powerful anti-sweatshop
student movement has emerged on campuses across the nation and in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Sit-ins, teach-ins, demonstrations and mock fashion shows have
become common, pressing administrators to crack down on the
companies that are licensed to provide foreign-made sports
uniforms, T-shirts, mugs, banners and other merchandise sold with
the colleges' logos.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is big business _ $2.5 billion in annual college
merchandise sales nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every student has some kind of UC clothing, but we have little
idea under what conditions these items are made,'' said Smriti
Rana, a student activist at the University of California at
Berkeley. ``The college shirts and hats that we wear with pride
shouldn't be manufactured in demeaning and abusive conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure also has come from Congress and the California
Legislature, which have approved resolutions sponsored by Rep.
George Miller, D-Calif., and State Senate President John Burton,
D-San Francisco, calling on all universities to bar sweatshop labor
in the manufacture of their licensed products.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the University of California enacted a preliminary
code of labor rights for its licensees. And since mid-March, 56
universities _ including three in California _ have joined the Fair
Labor Association, a new, White House-sponsored coalition of
corporations and human-rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens more universities are expected to join the FLA in the
coming weeks. The American Council on Education, which represents
nearly all the nation's 1,800 colleges and universities, is urging
all its members to join.
</P>
<P>
   However, many student activists say that the FLA's code of
conduct and monitoring system are unacceptably weak and that
colleges should not rush to join.
</P>
<P>
   On UC campuses, a coalition of students and faculty is demanding
that the university cancel its expected decision to join the FLA.
Instead, they say UC should strengthen its own code of conduct _
for example, by requiring all licensees to publicly disclose the
locations of their factories _ and should set up its own
organization to visit factories suspected of violations.
</P>
<P>
   In a March 25 letter to the coalition, UC Senior Vice President
Wayne Kennedy warned that although some of the students' demands
are ``eminently fair,'' they risk becoming ``an empty gesture
because of the virtual, if not literal, impossibility of
enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   FLA leaders predict that a compromise will be reached under
which UC and other schools use the FLA monitoring system to enforce
strengthened versions of the universities' own codes.

 SIMPLE WAY TO CLEAN UP REFUGEE CAMPS' MESS  &HT;     By MICHAEL TAYLOR 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ The Clinton administration is urging the United
Nations agency coordinating refugee relief in the Balkans to adopt
a Bay Area engineer's plan to ease the ``horrendous'' sanitation
problems in the refugee camps by issuing inexpensive five-gallon
plastic buckets to the nearly half a million Kosovars now huddled
in Macedonia and Albania.
<P>
   The buckets, which are normally used by supermarkets to hold
bulk food items, have tightly sealable lids and might cost from 60
cents to $1 each, depending on the supplier. About 1,000 of them
could be stacked on a pallet that is deliverable by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   At the camps, refugees would use the buckets in the privacy of
their own family compounds or circles, then eventually dump the
contents at a central disposal area where lengths of plastic pipe
lying in a ditch are hooked up to a deep pit.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; x  &LR;  The bucket proposal was developed by Berkeley engineer and
inventor Bill Wattenburg, who over the past 20 years has come up
with such varied ideas as a helicopter-towed blanket of chains and
harrow blades for exploding acres of postwar mine fields, and using
surplus railroad flatcars for makeshift bridges over washed-out
roads.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; uncx  &LR;  ``When you have these masses of refugees in these camps,
you can't control sanitation,'' Wattenburg said last week. ``But
give them each a five-gallon bucket and it would help a great
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is right now, the refugees _ about 129,000 in Macedonia
and 339,000 in Albania _ are living in abject squalor, according to
those who have just returned from the camps. There are few toilets,
and people stand in lines for hours or simply relieve themselves in
the fields or in the buildings where they are housed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just two days ago, I visited three sites and it was just
horrendous,'' said Maha Muna, deputy director of the Women's
Commission for Refugee Women and Children. ``One place, in the town
of Korce (Albania), there was a stadium where 900 refugees were
sleeping on a basketball floor. They had one bathroom with two
toilets and the system had backed up. On the floor was an
accumulation of excrement and children and women were wading into
that area, trying to get water from a sink.''
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Albassan, refugees were sleeping on cement floors
of a warehouse that had no sanitation facilities. Muna said nearby
Albanian families were inviting refugees into their homes to take
showers and use the facilities.
</P>
<P>
   At this warehouse, Muna said, children are dehydrated, many have
diarrhea and they are ``sleeping in cold, humid conditions. A lack
of sanitation is compounding all these problems and if there isn't
much more relief, we will have an overflow of infectious
diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   Wattenburg forwarded his idea to the White House within the past
two weeks, and it went from there to the National Security Council
to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration official who declined to be identified
said the Wattenburg proposal ``sounds very straightforward. You
take these buckets to the camps and each one becomes a family's
private latrine. It all makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, Army Colonel Jay Erb said, ``It's a great idea.
It's certainly better than anything I have at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Erb, who is one of the Pentagon officers working on the refugee
problem, said armed forces and international relief organizations
that are helping the refugees have already installed portable
toilets and latrines, ``but we still have a sanitation problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So even if we build latrines, I like this (bucket) idea as an
option.''
</P>
<P>
   Erb said the Wattenburg proposal was forwarded, through
channels, to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva. The
commissioner's agency is the one that coordinates the huge relief
efforts being mounted worldwide for the Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
   b Judith Kumin, the commissioner's spokeswoman, said from Geneva
that she had not yet seen the proposal and therefore could not
comment on it.

THE DOVES OF YESTERYEAR FLY OFF TO A DIFFERENT WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 (jt)  
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Think of NATO's 50th anniversary summit
meeting as the first war council of the Cold War's anti-warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders who had reputations for avoiding the draft or
demonstrating against nuclear missiles will gather at the end of
this week in a building named for Ronald Reagan and vow to continue
doing things many of them vowed in the 1960s never to do.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Kosovo is a liberal's kind of war. Bombs away in the
fight against inhumanity, say President Clinton, Prime Minister
Tony Blair of Britain, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany and
the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Their stated goal is to force one of the world's last Communist
dictators to stop terrible outrages against the ethnic Albanian
population of Kosovo, the worst crimes against humanity in Europe
since Hitler, and let the refugees return under international
protection.
</P>
<P>
   This is a war aim acceptable to all but dyed-in-the-wool
pacifists. But the political landscape of this war is also more
complicated than that. Not all Cold War doves were pacifists by any
means, and Kosovo has revealed shifts in the geopolitical strategic
ground on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   In France, political followers of Gen. Charles de Gaulle, who
kicked NATO headquarters out of France in 1966 because he thought
the alliance was an instrument of American domination, are now
letting the American Supreme Allied Commander, Gen. Wesley Clark,
have all the Mirage-2000 and Super Etendard warplanes he asks for.
The French hate the actions of Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan
Milosevic, as much as the Americans do.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, Social Democrats and Green Party pacifists, who
earned their left-wing credentials opposing the deployment of
American nuclear missiles to Europe in the 1980s, are now sending
Luftwaffe Tornado fighter-bombers to the Balkans. It is democratic
Germany's first combat action abroad, and it was unthinkable only a
few years ago in a country still struggling with the legacy of its
actions in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, Prime Minister Massimo d'Alema, who protested Italy's
support for the Persian Gulf War in 1991, has made the entire
country into one giant aircraft carrier for the daily blitz across
the Adriatic.
</P>
<P>
   And in America, President Clinton is being challenged to be even
more hawkish by an unlikely coalition. It is made up of
conservative Republicans who thought American political leaders
stabbed the military in the back during the Vietnam War, and many
liberal Democrats who opposed that war altogether. Together, in the
name of the refugees, they are asking a former draft avoider to do
what Lyndon Johnson tried 35 years ago: Send in ground troops to do
what air power alone can't do, and win the war.
</P>
<P>
   All these ironies have rich and complex overtones.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton may be wary of being pushed down the slippery
slope of a ground war in Kosovo partly because some of the loudest
advocates of a stronger policy are the same political opponents who
tried to bring him down with impeachment earlier this year _ and
because he is aware of how destructive the Vietnam War proved to be
for Johnson's domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some of the loudest advocates of staying out
of Kosovo are conservative Republican Cold War hawks like Pat
Buchanan. In the Washington Post last week, he wrote that ``America
must retrench and rearm,'' and not go ``marching into the Big
Muddy,'' a phrase last heard on the lips of Pete Seeger in the days
when anti-Vietnam demonstrators tried to levitate the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have opposed the Kosovo involvement from the start
include former Vice President Dan Quayle. On the other hand,
Elizabeth Dole visited refugee Albanians in Macedonia last week,
declaring, ``This is genocide'' and ``This is a war we must win.'`
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials expect Clinton to tread carefully through the
ground-force minefield at the three-day summit, which opens on
Friday in Washington. And many of his European partners will be
doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who voted against German defense
budgets in the early 1980s because of the American missile plans,
is now called ``the war chancellor'' by his Social Democratic
Party's left wing.
</P>
<P>
   But he has also put forward a detailed peace plan worked out by
another erstwhile peace movement activist, Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer, to bring Russia and the United Nations into the search for
a diplomatic settlement. The plan would suspend NATO bombing, 24
hours at a time, if Milosevic starts withdrawing forces from Kosovo
and lets the refugees go back.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder also got his European Union partners to offer to put
Kosovo under European protection in an eventual settlement, showing
that for all their solidarity, the European allies believe NATO
alone cannot impose a lasting solution in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's new generation of leaders are bombing Kosovo more
for moral reasons than for the classic Realpolitik aim of
preserving NATO's credibility in an unstable environment. Allied
leaders may endorse such a broad aim at their meeting, but their
greatest concern in Kosovo is bringing an end to the ordeal of the
refugees.

<P>
   In the modern world, it seems, democracies go to war only for
moral war aims, but morality, like truth, can easily become the
first casualty. Incidents like the NATO bombing of a bridge last
week that accidentally killed Serb civilians on a train, or like
the mistakenly dropped bomb that killed Albanian refugees traveling
in a a convoy of vehicles, can test public support for the bombing,
and Clark is acutely aware of the danger. He has repeatedly
stressed that the allies are not trying to make war on civilians,
Serbs or Albanians. But innocent victims of the bombing are
inevitable the longer and more intense the air campaign becomes.
</P>
<P>
   Such jingoism as the allies muster depends mainly on having a
diabolic adversary. France's Gaullist president, Jacques Chirac, is
as hard as Clark on ``Milosevic,'' who doesn't even rate a ``Mr.''
from the French leader any more. ``The spirit of Munich,
isolationism and compromising have never brought anything but
misfortune,'' Chirac told the French last week in his third
television address on Kosovo, sounding for all the world like
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   The French Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, like Chirac
a military veteran, pacified left-wing critics of the bombing,
including some within his own government, by saying that France was
not just slavishly following the American lead on Kosovo but
prosecuting the war in its own national and European interest.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most vehement of the allies are the British. Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook, whose left-wing pacifist activities in the
1980s made American officials worry when Prime Minister Tony Blair
named him to the post, has become one of Albright's closest
friends.
</P>
<P>
   And Blair sounds positively Churchillian, in vehemence if not in
eloquence: ``There is not going to be a halt to the NATO action
until the demands that we have set out, which are entirely
reasonable, humane, civilized demands, are met in full,'' he said
last week. ``And the determination of the whole of not just Europe
but, I think, of the vast majority of people in the international
community to see this thing through is absolute.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are two things that all these European left-centrists
agree on. One is that sending ground troops into Kosovo, even in a
peacekeeping force, is not going to happen unless the United
Nations gives the alliance an explicit mandate to do so. That means
Russian acquiescence to an operation that probably would not be
feasible until a lot more bombing has taken its toll on the Serb
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the present circumstances, the potential loss of life among
our service men and women, to say nothing of civilians, would be
considerable,'' Blair told Parliament last week.
</P>
<P>
   And the other is that Europe cannot forever go on depending on
the United States to deal with recurrent European crises like
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   So Clinton will probably be confronted in Washington with strong
calls by the allies, led by France and Britain, for the creation of
a strong and independent European defense pillar within the
alliance. Blair and Chirac agreed last year that Europe should have
an autonomous defense capability to ensure the stability of its own
back yard.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sea change for Britain, which in the past has seemed
to the French to be a NATO sycophant.
</P>
<P>
   Life is full of surprises these days, even in the alliance. ``I
never dreamed I would be spending my 51st birthday at a NATO
foreign ministers' conference,'' Fischer mused last Monday. But
there he was, and who ever would have thought it?

THE DOVES OF YESTERYEAR FLY OFF TO A DIFFERENT WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 (jt)  
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Think of NATO's 50th anniversary summit
meeting as the first war council of the Cold War's anti-warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders who had reputations for avoiding the draft or
demonstrating against nuclear missiles will gather at the end of
this week in a building named for Ronald Reagan and vow to continue
doing things many of them vowed in the 1960s never to do.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Kosovo is a liberal's kind of war. Bombs away in the
fight against inhumanity, say President Clinton, Prime Minister
Tony Blair of Britain, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany and
the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Their stated goal is to force one of the world's last Communist
dictators to stop terrible outrages against the ethnic Albanian
population of Kosovo, the worst crimes against humanity in Europe
since Hitler, and let the refugees return under international
protection.
</P>
<P>
   This is a war aim acceptable to all but dyed-in-the-wool
pacifists. But the political landscape of this war is also more
complicated than that. Not all Cold War doves were pacifists by any
means, and Kosovo has revealed shifts in the geopolitical strategic
ground on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   In France, political followers of Gen. Charles de Gaulle, who
kicked NATO headquarters out of France in 1966 because he thought
the alliance was an instrument of American domination, are now
letting the American Supreme Allied Commander, Gen. Wesley Clark,
have all the Mirage-2000 and Super Etendard warplanes he asks for.
The French hate the actions of Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan
Milosevic, as much as the Americans do.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, Social Democrats and Green Party pacifists, who
earned their left-wing credentials opposing the deployment of
American nuclear missiles to Europe in the 1980s, are now sending
Luftwaffe Tornado fighter-bombers to the Balkans. It is democratic
Germany's first combat action abroad, and it was unthinkable only a
few years ago in a country still struggling with the legacy of its
actions in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, Prime Minister Massimo d'Alema, who protested Italy's
support for the Persian Gulf War in 1991, has made the entire
country into one giant aircraft carrier for the daily blitz across
the Adriatic.
</P>
<P>
   And in America, President Clinton is being challenged to be even
more hawkish by an unlikely coalition. It is made up of
conservative Republicans who thought American political leaders
stabbed the military in the back during the Vietnam War, and many
liberal Democrats who opposed that war altogether. Together, in the
name of the refugees, they are asking a former draft avoider to do
what Lyndon Johnson tried 35 years ago: Send in ground troops to do
what air power alone can't do, and win the war.
</P>
<P>
   All these ironies have rich and complex overtones.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton may be wary of being pushed down the slippery
slope of a ground war in Kosovo partly because some of the loudest
advocates of a stronger policy are the same political opponents who
tried to bring him down with impeachment earlier this year _ and
because he is aware of how destructive the Vietnam War proved to be
for Johnson's domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some of the loudest advocates of staying out
of Kosovo are conservative Republican Cold War hawks like Pat
Buchanan. In the Washington Post last week, he wrote that ``America
must retrench and rearm,'' and not go ``marching into the Big
Muddy,'' a phrase last heard on the lips of Pete Seeger in the days
when anti-Vietnam demonstrators tried to levitate the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have opposed the Kosovo involvement from the start
include former Vice President Dan Quayle. On the other hand,
Elizabeth Dole visited refugee Albanians in Macedonia last week,
declaring, ``This is genocide'' and ``This is a war we must win.'`
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials expect Clinton to tread carefully through the
ground-force minefield at the three-day summit, which opens on
Friday in Washington. And many of his European partners will be
doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who voted against German defense
budgets in the early 1980s because of the American missile plans,
is now called ``the war chancellor'' by his Social Democratic
Party's left wing.
</P>
<P>
   But he has also put forward a detailed peace plan worked out by
another erstwhile peace movement activist, Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer, to bring Russia and the United Nations into the search for
a diplomatic settlement. The plan would suspend NATO bombing, 24
hours at a time, if Milosevic starts withdrawing forces from Kosovo
and lets the refugees go back.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder also got his European Union partners to offer to put
Kosovo under European protection in an eventual settlement, showing
that for all their solidarity, the European allies believe NATO
alone cannot impose a lasting solution in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's new generation of leaders are bombing Kosovo more
for moral reasons than for the classic Realpolitik aim of
preserving NATO's credibility in an unstable environment. Allied
leaders may endorse such a broad aim at their meeting, but their
greatest concern in Kosovo is bringing an end to the ordeal of the
refugees.

<P>
   In the modern world, it seems, democracies go to war only for
moral war aims, but morality, like truth, can easily become the
first casualty. Incidents like the NATO bombing of a bridge last
week that accidentally killed Serb civilians on a train, or like
the mistakenly dropped bomb that killed Albanian refugees traveling
in a a convoy of vehicles, can test public support for the bombing,
and Clark is acutely aware of the danger. He has repeatedly

WALK THIS WAY, OR HOW THE JAPANESE KEPT IN STEP 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   TOKYO _ Almost any reference book on Japanese history includes
the dates of the most obscure shogun or emperor. But then there are
the more basic historical puzzles, such as _ how did the Japanese
walk?
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars here argue that from ancient times until perhaps
150 years ago, virtually all Japanese learned to walk in a special
style called the namba, in which the right arm and leg swing
forward at the same time, and then the left arm and leg swing
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Try it: these days it seems counter-intuitive. Almost everybody
in the world now walks the opposite way, with the right leg and
left arm moving forward at the same time, and vice-versa.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in Japan, if these scholars are right, the namba at one time
was almost universal. In fact people often did not swing their arms
much at all, but at a minimum their right shoulder moved with the
right leg and left shoulder with the left leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, Japanese were deliberately educated in how they
should walk,'' said Masaichi Nomura, a leading cultural
anthropologist at the National Museum of Ethnology in Osaka. ``They
were shown by their parents how to walk in the home, in a tatami
room. But now in modern Japan, there's no walking education at all.
People walk any way they want to.''
</P>
<P>
   If Nomura and other scholars who have written about the namba
are correct and it was common in olden times, then the training of
young people in a particular walking style underscores the
regimentation of life in ancient Japan. Conversely, the decline of
the walk reflects the way society has opened up in the 19th and
20th centuries to a greater pluralism of ideas, values and even
ways of walking.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the research on namba walking _ in scholarly works
written only in Japanese _ has attracted little attention abroad or
even here in Japan. Most scholars who have studied the issue appear
to agree with Nomura, but because there is little discussion about
the theories, it is difficult to know how credible the idea of the
namba is. There is some evidence, but it seems skimpy.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient histories do not address the subject, and there is
little evidence that Chinese or other visitors saw anything
different about how the Japanese walked. So scholars have conducted
research in part by studying old paintings or woodblock prints.
Sure enough, the pictures seem to show most Japanese moving their
right shoulders or arms forward with their right legs, or left
shoulders and arms with the left leg.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars have noted that more ritualized kinds of movement _ in
noh opera, kabuki theater, folk dancing or kendo _ usually involve
the right leg moving with the right arm, or the left leg with the
left arm. Namba itself is a kabuki term referring to this kind of
synchronism between arms and legs.
</P>
<P>
   Past efforts by some Japanese to emphasize their uniqueness have
fallen into disfavor. People now laugh at the government's old
suggestions that the Japanese could not eat much foreign beef
because of the special nature of Japanese intestines, or that they
could not import foreign skis because of the unique nature of
Japanese snow. Perhaps to avoid falling into the uniqueness trap,
the scholars say that the namba was not exclusively Japanese and
that there is some evidence that at times Mongols and Turks and
other peoples also walked in this way.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, the scholars argue, a bit of the namba has survived
in the way the Japanese walk: they say that many Japanese bend
their knees slightly and swing their arms less when walking than
Westerners do, and that the Japanese are more likely to step flatly
or forward on their toes, while Americans and Europeans step on to
their heels first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find the theory very interesting and original,'' said Ryugo
Matsui, a cultural anthropologist at Surugadai University near
Tokyo. ``I personally feel that even now, some Japanese walk with
little swing of their hands, different from Westerners.''
</P>
<P>
   Ancient Japanese apparently taught not only their children to
walk in this way but also their horses. For traditional events like
yabusame, or archery from horseback, horses were trained to walk
first with their right legs and then with their left legs _ an
equine version of the namba. The trainers used poles to keep the
right legs moving together and the left legs together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horses were trained to run this way in order to prevent
wild up-and-down movements, which would make archery from horseback
very difficult,'' said Shigekatsu Motoyoshi, president of the
Japanese Society of Equine Science. Pacers in American harness
racing are also trained to run in this manner.
</P>
<P>
   One might think that teaching kids (let alone horses) to walk
with their arms and legs in synchronism is the ultimate example of
Japanese protocol and conformity. But Nomura says that the opposite
is true of Japan today.
</P>
<P>
   Westerners generally have the same walking style, Nomura said,
while the Japanese display much greater variation: some swinging
their arms, others keeping their arms at their sides; some stepping
onto their toes, other onto their heels, some stepping high and
others shuffling. The namba lives in some Japanese, he said, but
its greatest legacy is what might be called Japan's pede-diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's Japanese walk in a very individualist style,'' he
said. ``Westerners tend to walk all in the same way, while there's
much greater variety, much greater variation, among Japanese
walkers.''

   WASHINGTON _ I flew on a B-52 raid once. The enormous plane took
off from Guam, refueled over the Philippines, dropped its bombs on
North Vietnam through a dense overcast, turned around, refueled
again and landed safely back on Guam. In 16 or 18 hours, we sighted
no enemy. All we saw was sky and clouds, and the whole mission felt
antiseptic and unreal compared with the nasty, muddy, often lethal
reality that the foot soldiers faced.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Kosovo, if war is the right word, is a lot like that.
</P>
<P>
   This is a war in which one side _ the United States and its NATO
allies _ has set out as a matter of policy to hold itself
harm-free. So far it has worked, though a pilot could be killed or
captured at any moment. One American pilot was shot down, but he
escaped. Three hapless American soldiers wandered too close to the
border and fell into enemy hands; they were roughed up a bit, but
as far as Washington knows, they are in reasonably good shape.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical year, more than 200 American servicemen are killed
in accidents of one kind or another, which is roughly four a week.
In almost four weeks of war in Kosovo, not a single American has
died. No body bags have been unloaded at Dover Air Force Base in
Delaware, and no Americans have been dragged through the streets of
an enemy capital, as in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness. But meanwhile, substantial numbers of Serbians
have died, including a fair number of civilians. An unknown number
of ethnic Albanian refugees _ the very ``innocent civilians'' that
President Clinton said the operation was designed to help _ were
killed Wednesday by allied bombs. Inevitably, military forces are
intermixed with the civil population. No bomb, no missile and no
pilot is smart enough to avoid hitting both on occasion. No
electronic system can eliminate human fallibility.
</P>
<P>
   The point here is not that the attacks should stop. The point is
that baby boomer warfare does not work. Bill Clinton and Tony Blair
were born too late to experience World War II, however indirectly,
and they have grown up in an age mesmerized by technology.
Impressed by their ability to kill from afar, with almost no risk
of retaliation against those firing the weapons, Clinton has
launched cruise missiles at Afghanistan, Sudan, Iraq and Serbia in
the last six months alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Limited actions beget limited results,'' said Sen. John McCain
of Arizona, a Navy pilot in Vietnam who is seeking the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not only ruled out using ground troops; he has told
the world (including Slobodan Milosevic) that he has done so, which
is rather like a pitcher announcing that he intends to throw
nothing but curve balls. Until recently, NATO has used mostly
fast-flying (and, in the case of the refugee column, high-flying)
jet aircraft, making accidents more likely. This is not the kind of
work for which high-performance planes are ideally suited.
</P>
<P>
   The slower-flying A-10 Warthogs that were designed for close-in
ground-support and tactical bombing have only recently come into
action, and Apache helicopters have not been used yet. They might
have been able to avoid the mistakes that killed most of the
civilians. But they would also have been more vulnerable to ground
fire.
</P>
<P>
   No president wants to expose his forces to heedless casualties.
No general, either, not even George S. Patton, who assured Third
Army troops on the eve of D-Day that only 2 percent of them would
die in a major battle, because they would never be committed to
Verdun-style trench warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. But minimizing one's own casualties while slugging
it out with an enemy on the ground, trying to maximize his losses
in pursuit of a clearly attainable if costly objective, represents
one kind of morality. It is another thing altogether to expose
innocents to death to preserve a strategy of self-protection that
may never work and will take a lot longer to work, if it ever does,
than one that exposes some of our troops to danger.
</P>
<P>
   Again, when hundreds of thousands of refugees were forced into
the woods without food, water or shelter, NATO briefly considered
low- or high-altitude air drops. The idea was abandoned as too
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Civilian officials at NATO headquarters acknowledged that they
were skittish about losing cargo planes, too, given the
capabilities of Serbian air defenses that remain intact. And Maj.
Gen. Charles Wald, the vice director of strategic planning at the
Pentagon, added that ``airdrops are very, very dangerous, and there
is no indication at all that Milosevic would allow us to fly
airdrops in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   If allied troops were involved, instead of refugees, the
airdrops would never have been questioned. During the Battle of the
Bulge in World War II, American pilots flew through murderous flak
to drop supplies and ammunition to the beleaguered garrison at
Bastogne. French pilots did much the same thing during the siege of
Dienbienphu in the first Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   The essential nature of combat is the fear that you may die
before you can kill your enemy. Isn't that what gives scale and
meaning to an essentially savage act? And doesn't removing the
element of sacrifice through push-button warfare somehow corrupt
even the most nobly motivated war?

ON KILLING FROM BEYOND HARM'S WAY

   WASHINGTON _ I flew on a B-52 raid once. The enormous plane took
off from Guam, refueled over the Philippines, dropped its bombs on
North Vietnam through a dense overcast, turned around, refueled
again and landed safely back on Guam. In 16 or 18 hours, we sighted
no enemy. All we saw was sky and clouds, and the whole mission felt
antiseptic and unreal compared with the nasty, muddy, often lethal
reality that the foot soldiers faced.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Kosovo, if war is the right word, is a lot like that.
</P>
<P>
   This is a war in which one side _ the United States and its NATO
allies _ has set out as a matter of policy to hold itself
harm-free. So far it has worked, though a pilot could be killed or
captured at any moment. One American pilot was shot down, but he
escaped. Three hapless American soldiers wandered too close to the
border and fell into enemy hands; they were roughed up a bit, but
as far as Washington knows, they are in reasonably good shape.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical year, more than 200 American servicemen are killed
in accidents of one kind or another, which is roughly four a week.
In almost four weeks of war in Kosovo, not a single American has
died. No body bags have been unloaded at Dover Air Force Base in
Delaware, and no Americans have been dragged through the streets of
an enemy capital, as in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness. But meanwhile, substantial numbers of Serbians
have died, including a fair number of civilians. An unknown number
of ethnic Albanian refugees _ the very ``innocent civilians'' that
President Clinton said the operation was designed to help _ were
killed Wednesday by allied bombs. Inevitably, military forces are
intermixed with the civil population. No bomb, no missile and no
pilot is smart enough to avoid hitting both on occasion. No
electronic system can eliminate human fallibility.
</P>
<P>
   The point here is not that the attacks should stop. The point is
that baby boomer warfare does not work. Bill Clinton and Tony Blair

HOW GLOBALISM RUINED AN ASIAN SUCCESS STORY

   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ His children were weeping, and his wife
looked shell-shocked. But as the guards led him away to serve a
six-year prison sentence last week, Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister, Anwar Ibrahim, seemed to be prepping himself for the next
round of a boxing match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold fast to the struggle,'' Anwar said in a fiery statement
just after he was found guilty of corruption. ``Love Malaysia. And
if we do love Malaysia, then the fight against injustice must be
invigorated.''
</P>
<P>
   While Anwar, 51, vows he will lead a campaign to unseat
Malaysia's strong-willed leader, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad,
it is not clear he can be much of an insurgent from behind bars. If
Malaysia recovers from the ravages of the Asian economic crisis,
the 73-year-old Mahathir seems likely to survive the most serious
threat to his 18-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the downfall of Anwar shows how outside economic forces
can sunder the political culture of even a well-governed country.
Before the Asian crisis devastated Malaysia's economy, Anwar and
Mahathir rarely disagreed. Now, the two men are locked in a feud so
bitter that Anwar likens his former mentor to Hitler, while
Mahathir accuses his protege of being a sodomist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic crisis unfolded into a political crisis, with
changes in regimes throughout the region,'' said K.S. Jomo, a
political economist at the University of Malaya. ``That scared
Mahathir, and it emboldened Anwar.''
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, believes her husband had
become too much of a threat to Mahathir. ``It was a foregone
conclusion that he was going to be found guilty,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, Mahathir and Anwar were inseparable, united in
a drive to turn this former British colony into Exhibit A of the
Asian miracle. With foreign money pouring in, Malaysia became a
wonderland of development. American companies built factories to
take advantage of the cheap work force, and the living standard
rose.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir and Anwar flexed their muscles in different ways. The
prime minister built the world's tallest skyscrapers in Kuala
Lumpur, while Anwar cultivated an image as a new-style Asian
leader. In his book, ``The Asian Renaissance,'' he tried to square
Asian values with Western capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   But last year Malaysia got caught in the riptide of globalism,
and the strain drove both men to extreme positions. Mahathir argued
that Malaysia should shield itself against the predations of
foreign currency speculators by erecting barriers around its
markets. Anwar favored the International Monetary Fund's castor-oil
remedy of open markets and high interest rates. He said the prime
minister was just trying to protect his cronies.
</P>
<P>
   Just when Mahathir seemed to be on the ropes, he lashed back _
imposing controls on Malaysia's currency markets and sacking his
deputy. Three weeks later, Anwar was arrested and charged with
corruption and sex crimes.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to cast the feud between Mahathir and Anwar in
Manichean terms. Anwar's trial had all the appearances of a
railroading. And Dr. Mahathir has won few friends outside Malaysia
with his inflammatory remarks about the influence of the financier
George Soros and Jewish currency speculators.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in The New York Times on Thursday, written from
prison, Anwar accused Mahathir of being ``a has-been leader who had
descended to cruelty in desperate bid to cling to power.''
</P>
<P>
   But such a portrayal is simplistic. Political analysts here said
Mahathir mixes populist, anti-Western rhetoric with a sophisticated
understanding of the global economy. Even critics credit him for
fashioning a harmonious country out of a combustible mixture of
Malays, ethnic Chinese and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Anwar is no helpless victim. Analysts describe him as
a skilled and even ruthless politician who did not hesitate to hand
out his share of plum government contracts to solidify his power
base. Anwar has honed his image overseas, through a network of
Western-style spin doctors.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Anwar's downfall is yet more evidence that global
capitalism can be a powerful destabilizing force. It set off
poisonous animosities in two leaders who shared a common vision of
Malaysia's future. And the resulting power struggle left this
once-peaceful and prosperous country sadly diminished.

CLINTON FOREIGN POLICY: ATTENTION TO KOSOVO, INATTENTION TO CHINA

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In their new book ``Preventative Defense,'' former
Defense Secretary William Perry and a former Pentagon colleague,
Ashton Carter, argue that 10 years into the post-Cold War,
Washington forgets that some nations matter a lot more than others.
</P>
<P>
   There is a short ``A list'' of nations that could some day pose
a threat to ``the survival or way of life of Americans'' _ a Russia
that goes the way of Weimar Germany, or a China that becomes a
hostile superpower.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is a well-stocked ``B list'' of ``imminent threats to
U.S. interests,'' including the fractious Persian Gulf states and
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   And finally comes the ``C list,'' which the authors say is
composed of ``the Kosovos, Bosnias, Somalias, Rwandas and Haitis''
_ all urgent, but places where American interests are usually hard
to define.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, it sounds reasonable and orderly. But the C list looms
vivid on live TV, making it all-consuming for Washington while far
less dramatic A list problems are put on the back burner.
</P>
<P>
   And that appears to be exactly what happened over the last 10
days as China's savvy prime minister, Zhu Rongji, drove up to the
White House ready to resolve one of the most complex issues in
Sino-American relations _ a huge trade deal that is really about
China's influence in the world and America's influence on China.
Problem was, he arrived at a moment when a president who has
pressed ``engagement'' with China was elsewhere engaged.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a weeklong White House fumble that left the
Chinese angry, the president embarrassed, the business community
enraged and Congress confused. In the end, Zhu left the United
States with a hastily telephoned assurance from Clinton that China
would get into the World Trade Organization this year, with
American blessing, if China kept its promises and gave a bit more.
But the whole messy handling of China's premier reformer left some
administration officials wondering whether this White House can
bomb Belgrade and negotiate with Beijing at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a classic case of distraction,'' one White House
official conceded late last week, trying to explain why the White
House had to issue three separate joint statements with Zhu in five
days.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, the man bringing market reforms to China even as millions
wander the countryside unemployed, decided earlier this year that
China was either going to get globalized fast or get lost in the
race. ``Either we look like Singapore or we look like Russia,'' one
of his aides commented recently. ``And that's not a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   So Zhu offered market-opening concessions in agriculture,
telecommunications, banking, insurance and other industries that go
far beyond what most American officials thought possible. And the
morning of his arrival here, Clinton made the strongest case yet
for ushering China into the World Trade Organization, arguing it
would not only mean billions for American firms, but that it would
bring the rule of law to China. And, breaking new ground, he argued
that an economically weak China was far more dangerous to America
than a strong China.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, though, Clinton walked away from the deal, at least
for the time being. China had not given enough, his aides argued.
He was worried, his advisers say, that the Democratic left, backed
by the unions, would kill off any deal once they allied with
conservatives saying there should be no deal with a China that
steals nuclear secrets and represses dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical middle that you need to support a deal like this
is shrinking,'' said Commerce Secretary William Daley, explaining
why the White House needed what he called ``a bulletproof deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But in trade, nothing's bulletproof. American textile makers
will never like a deal that lets China expand its presence in the
American market. Nor will steel makers, or steel unions. Many in
Congress argue that China has no intention of fulfilling its
market-opening promises. But the vast majority of big businesses
say that if Clinton doesn't sign soon, the huge gains made in many
areas will be eaten away as soon as Zhu returns to Beijing and
faces bureaucrats screaming: ``You gave away what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes this such a critical moment,'' said Edward
S. Steinfeld, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology who has studied China's state-owned enterprises. ``This
agreement puts tremendous pressure on China to change its
industrial structure, and to some degree its politics. It will be
painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the question is, how can you say that you want a
market-based China, enmeshed in a global legal system, and walk
away from this?''

Chinese angry, the president embarrassed, the business community
enraged and Congress confused. In the end, Zhu left the United
States with a hastily telephoned assurance from Clinton that China
would get into the World Trade Organization this year, with
American blessing, if China kept its promises and gave a bit more.
But the whole messy handling of China's premier reformer left some
administration officials wondering whether this White House can
bomb Belgrade and negotiate with Beijing at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a classic case of distraction,'' one White House
official conceded late last week, trying to explain why the White
House had to issue three separate joint statements with Zhu in five
days.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, the man bringing market reforms to China even as millions
wander the countryside unemployed, decided earlier this year that
China was either going to get globalized fast or get lost in the
race. ``Either we look like Singapore or we look like Russia,'' one
of his aides commented recently. ``And that's not a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   So Zhu offered market-opening concessions in agriculture,
telecommunications, banking, insurance and other industries that go
far beyond what most American officials thought possible. And the
morning of his arrival here, Clinton made the strongest case yet
for ushering China into the World Trade Organization, arguing it
would not only mean billions for American firms, but that it would
bring the rule of law to China. And, breaking new ground, he argued
that an economically weak China was far more dangerous to America
than a strong China.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, though, Clinton walked away from the deal, at least
for the time being. China had not given enough, his aides argued.
He was worried, his advisers say, that the Democratic left, backed
by the unions, would kill off any deal once they allied with
conservatives saying there should be no deal with a China that
steals nuclear secrets and represses dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical middle that you need to support a deal like this
is shrinking,'' said Commerce Secretary William Daley, explaining
why the White House needed what he called ``a bulletproof deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But in trade, nothing's bulletproof. American textile makers
will never like a deal that lets China expand its presence in the
American market. Nor will steel makers, or steel unions. Many in
Congress argue that China has no intention of fulfilling its
market-opening promises. But the vast majority of big businesses
say that if Clinton doesn't sign soon, the huge gains made in many
areas will be eaten away as soon as Zhu returns to Beijing and
faces bureaucrats screaming: ``You gave away what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes this such a critical moment,'' said Edward
S. Steinfeld, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology who has studied China's state-owned enterprises. ``This
agreement puts tremendous pressure on China to change its
industrial structure, and to some degree its politics. It will be
painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the question is, how can you say that you want a
market-based China, enmeshed in a global legal system, and walk
away from this?''
</P>

   UNITED NATIONS _ At the century's last session of the Commission
on Human Rights, Secretary-General Kofi Annan of the United Nations
unveiled a doctrine with profound implications for international
relations in the new millennium. The airstrikes against Yugoslavia,
he said on April 7, showed that the world would no longer permit
nations intent on committing genocide to ``hide'' behind the U.N.
charter, which has traditionally safeguarded national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The protection of human rights, he said, must ``take precedence
over concerns of state sovereignty.'' ``As long as I am
secretary-general,'' said Annan, the United Nations ``will always
place human beings at the center of everything we do.'' This was
not the secretary general acting alone. He was, he acknowledged,
only embracing an ``evolving'' international norm. He also
acknowledged that using force to protect human rights poses
``fundamental challenges'' to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, an erosion of sovereignty when it conflicts with human
rights standards is reflected in many events of the last decade:
the creation of international tribunals to try individuals accused
of crimes against humanity in Yugoslavia and Rwanda; Spain's effort
to extradite the former Chilean leader, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, from
Britain for trial on charges of crimes against humanity, and the
impending trial of two Libyans before a Scottish court in the
Netherlands over charges that they bombed an American jetliner over
Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent, analysts agree, Annan's own stance is a
reaction to his own searing experience as the head of peacekeeping
in Rwanda, when more than half a million people were slaughtered as
the Security Council withdrew U.N. forces.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that Annan has merely blessed a ``given'' of the
political climate today: the growing importance of human rights to
the United Nations and many of its 185 members. This was most
evident in the Security Council's overwhelming rejection two weeks
ago of a resolution condemning NATO's airstrikes as illegal on
grounds that the Security Council had not authorized them. Only
Namibia joined Russia and China, the co-sponsors of the motion, in
arguing that Serbia's treatment of its Albanian minority was
essentially an internal matter.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's doctrine, predictably, has won praise from the
burgeoning human rights community. But others argue that though
well-intentioned, it is naive, dangerous and likely to increase
tensions and paralysis within the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   And at least one close adviser to Annan worries that intervening
to save white Europeans (albeit Muslims) in Kosovo, after having
ignored even worse massacres in Rwanda and elsewhere, leaves the
United Nations open to charges of selective morality and double
standards. Others argue that in a world with some 40 million
refugees and displaced people, Annan's stance risks stretching U.N.
resources to unbearable limits.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert S. Okun, a former American diplomat and U.N. adviser on
narcotics, warns that going to war to protect people is also
perilous. ``The use of force,'' he warns, ``is a very blunt
instrument on behalf of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others worry that respect for sovereignty has often been a
barrier to the expansion of internal conflicts, and has served as a
rallying point for collective action against aggressors.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches and articles last year, Annan addressed some of
these worries even as he signaled his growing anxiety about the
violations of rights occurring in Kosovo. Nation-states are not
going to disappear, he wrote in the journal ``Humanitarian
Intervention.'' Respect for the ``fundamental sovereignty,
territorial integrity, and political independence of states'' will
remain a ``cornerstone of the international system.'' Nevertheless,
he said last summer in Rome, the principle of sovereignty cannot
provide ``excuses for the inexcusable.'' The U.N. charter, he
reminded people in England last June, ``was issued in the name of
`the peoples,' not the governments, of the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Even China, said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human
Rights Watch, has not uniformly blocked humanitarian intervention
by the United Nations. For instance, it did not object to the
creation of ``no-fly zones'' in Iraq to protect the Kurdish
minority in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south against
Saddam Hussein's furious repression. The grosser the oppression
(or, more to the point, the less directly it resembled China's own
actions in Tibet) the greater Beijing's willingness to tolerate
humanitarian intervention. ``So even for China the door is not
completely shut,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   There is, as well, a link between the idea of stopping
atrocities and preserving the general peace, another key goal for
the United Nations. Roth argues that failure to respond to brutal
internal repression often emboldens a would-be aggressors. ``Our
failure to punish Iraq for its brutal repression of, and use of
chemical use of chemical weapons against, the Kurds in 1988 led
Saddam to conclude he could get away with invading Kuwait,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The resort to force, of course, need not be the first or
preferred means of intervention. Patiently applied, targeted
economic sanctions against Libya eventually prompted Moammar
Gadhafi, the Libyan leader, to surrender the two men charged with
bringing down Pan Am 103 over Scotland. On the other hand, almost a
decade of harsh sanctions against Iraq have failed to persuade
Saddam Hussein to disclose information about his quest for
unconventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military intervention in Kosovo reflects to some extent
the lessons of Iraq,'' said one senior diplomat, ``and of Rwanda.''
</P>
<P>
   The case for humanitarian intervention in Kosovo was persuasive
for both Europe and the United States for different reasons, one
senior diplomat asserted. America, an ``idea'' nation whose
national identity derives more from a ``value-driven agenda'' than
from traditional bonding notions of blood, religion or soil, has
long been an aggressive promoter of human rights. Also at stake for
America is NATO's very purpose and effectiveness as an alliance.
</P>
<P>
   And for Europe, the question of appearing indifferent to
repression and brutality was especially evocative. Even Germany,
which since World War II has resisted the use of force to solve
political problems, did not want to end the century by appearing
cold toward an echo of the atrocities it caused 60 years ago.
Paraphrasing Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of Germany, the
diplomat said the decision for Germany was between ``no more wars''
and ``no more Auschwitzes.'' It, like the rest of NATO, chose to go
to war this time.

<P>
   Medical science, focused on curing the ills of the body, has
often treated the mind like an annoying younger brother: a presence
to be ignored whenever possible, humored when unavoidable and used
as a scapegoat when the need arises.
</P>
<P>
   What modern medicine, until recently, has not done, in any
systematic fashion, is to view mental and physical process as
inextricably entwined. Though most paid homage to the importance of
treating the ``whole patient,'' medical scientists by and large
have remained faithful to Descartes' conception of mind-body
dualism, dutifully dividing the psychiatric from the physical. They
accepted that patients often respond emotionally to physical
disease. But doctors have largely disdained the possibility that
emotional state _ be it anxiety, anger or optimism _ might itself
alter the course of a physical illness, or that treating
psychological distress might improve physical health.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, it has become increasingly clear that to take
a strictly Cartesian view is problematic. For one thing, such a
view does not make room for the growing number of studies appearing
in mainstream medical journals that demonstrate the impact of
psychology on physiology. Most recently, researchers reported last
week in the Journal of the American Medical Association that
writing about traumatic experiences measurably improved the health
of some patients with chronic asthma or rheumatoid arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Of 70 patients in the study who spent 20 minutes on each of
three consecutive days writing about ``the most stressful
experience they had ever undergone,'' 47.1 percent showed
significant improvement on objective measures of disease severity
four months later, compared to 24.3 percent who improved in a
control group. The findings will have to be replicated by other
researchers, and many questions were left unanswered: How could a
simple writing exercise have such a substantial impact on patients'
health four months later? What factors make it more likely that an
individual patient will benefit from such a treatment?
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is difficult not to conclude, as Dr. David Spiegel,
associate chairman of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at
Stanford University, did in an editorial accompanying the study,
that ``the authors have provided evidence that medical treatment is
more effective when standard pharmacological intervention is
combined with the management of emotional distress.'' In this study
and others, he noted, ``it is not simply mind over matter, but it
is clear that mind matters.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1989 article in the British journal Lancet Spiegel and his
colleagues reported longer survival rates for breast cancer
survivors who took part in support groups emphasizing emotional
expression and active coping skills. Other researchers have
reported comparable findings for melanoma and lymphoma patients,
though three studies failed to find that psychosocial support
lengthened survival for cancer patients. A 1988 study by a team led
by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn found that meditation, a stress-reduction
technique, increased rates of improvement in psoriasis patients who
were also receiving standard medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Equally intriguing are studies that tackle the mind-body
equation by finding links between severe stress and illnesses. A
large study published last year found that people who suffered
abuse in childhood, had a parent who was alcoholic, an addict or a
battered woman, or endured other stressful situations, were two to
four times more likely to suffer serious illnesses like heart
disease, emphysema, and stroke than other adults. The frequency of
disorders, the researchers reported, increased with the number of
``adverse childhood experiences'' a person had been exposed to.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists have found that veterans with post-traumatic
stress disorder also were more likely to suffer from a variety of
severe maladies, including heart disease and diseases of the
respiratory, digestive and musculoskeletal system than were
veterans without the stress disorder. An artificial division
between conditions that belong to ``psychiatry'' and those that
belong to ``medicine'' is ``nonsense,'' said Dr. Matthew Friedman,
executive director of the National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder, ``because stress is something that happens to the brain.
It's not something in the ether that happens to the mind. Stress is
very real. It has lots of medical effects. It also has
psychological effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuroscientists, who are slowly unraveling the complex
interrelationship of genetics, chemistry and cellular function in
the brain, seem considerably more comfortable jettisoning the
dualism of Descartes than many clinicians in routine medical
specialities. With the help of new tools, including PET and MRI
scanning, gene knockouts and other technologies, they are revealing
the brain as much more plastic than was once thought. Brain
chemistry and structure, studies have shown, may be altered by
``psychological'' experiences, including learning and stress.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a much more integrated view of human functioning.
``We now realize that the brain is a lot more involved in governing
many different functions in the body,'' says Dr. Bruce McEwen,
director of the laboratory of endocrinology at Rockefeller
University and an expert on stress. ``Appetite, sleep, food intake,
emotions, health-promoting and self-destructive behaviors _ all
these things are both controlled by and in turn influence the
brain.''

 &UR; UNDATED: the brain &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   McEwen's work offers clues to how stressful experience might
eventually translate into physical illness, and how treatments that
reduce stress might prove beneficial to health. Just as blood
pressure and heart rate adjust when a person moves from a lying to
a standing position, the body's approach to stress is
``allostatic.'' That is, it strives to preserve stability through
change, making adjustments in regulatory systems _ heart rate,
hormone levels, metabolism, immune system _ in response to both the
external and internal environment.
</P>
<P>
   How strong and how long-lasting a person's response to stress is
depends on a variety of factors, including genetics, overall health
and how the person perceives the stress. And stress can be helpful
as well as harmful: Acute stress can enhance immune responses. But
McEwen and his colleagues have demonstrated that if stress
accumulates over weeks or months, the body's stress system can
become stuck in a partially ``on'' mode, causing damage and
disrupting normal responses. Prolonged stress, the work of McEwen
and other researchers has shown, can permanently damage nerve cells
in an area of the brain called the hippocampus, lead to
abnormalities in glucose metabolism and immune function, and are
associated with post-traumatic stress disorder.
</P>
<P>
   If scientists are discovering such strong evidence of
reciprocity between body and mind, why is there still resistance?
The answer has as much to do with sociology and politics as it does
with knowledge. While the public seems to have softened its
dualistic view _ Americans made 629 million visits to alternative
medicine practitioners in 1997, more visits than to all primary
care physicians _ many doctors remain distrustful of treatments
that purport to achieve physical results through psychological
means.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, caution is appropriate. False hope does no one
good, and exaggeration and distortion of the benefits of
alternative therapies are common: There is virtually no evidence
that mental state can cause serious disease _ that ``repressed''
people are more likely to get cancer, for instance. Nor is there
any science to support the assertion that psychological techniques
can cure, as opposed to modifying a person's response to, illness.
``If someone tells you that you can cure your cancer by imaging it
in your head, don't believe them,'' Spiegel said, ``but if they
tell you that it might help you cope with the disease once you've
got it, and that it might have some effect on disease course, as
well as quality of life, that might well be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Dr. Joshua Smyth, lead author of last week's asthma
and rheumatoid arthritis study, cautioned that, ``The worst
possible thing would be if people heard about this study and
concluded that if they keep a journal their asthma will go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some adjustments to Descartes' wall seem inevitable. And
the refusal to accept any influence of mind on body appears, at
this juncture, more the product of stubbornness than sense. For the
diehard reductionist, said Dr. David Hufford, professor of
humanities and behavioral science at Penn State College of
medicine, ``anything more ideational or symbolic is seen as coarse,
crude, naive and ultimately mistaken _ even if it gets some
practical effects.''

   Of 70 patients in the study who spent 20 minutes on each of
three consecutive days writing about ``the most stressful
experience they had ever undergone,'' 47.1 percent showed
significant improvement on objective measures of disease severity
four months later, compared to 24.3 percent who improved in a
control group. The findings will have to be replicated by other
researchers, and many questions were left unanswered: How could a
simple writing exercise have such a substantial impact on patients'
health four months later? What factors make it more likely that an
individual patient will benefit from such a treatment?
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is difficult not to conclude, as Dr. David Spiegel,
associate chairman of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at
Stanford University, did in an editorial accompanying the study,
that ``the authors have provided evidence that medical treatment is
more effective when standard pharmacological intervention is
combined with the management of emotional distress.'' In this study
and others, he noted, ``it is not simply mind over matter, but it
is clear that mind matters.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1989 article in the British journal Lancet Spiegel and his
colleagues reported longer survival rates for breast cancer
survivors who took part in support groups emphasizing emotional
expression and active coping skills. Other researchers have
reported comparable findings for melanoma and lymphoma patients,
though three studies failed to find that psychosocial support
lengthened survival for cancer patients. A 1988 study by a team led
by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn found that meditation, a stress-reduction
technique, increased rates of improvement in psoriasis patients who
were also receiving standard medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Equally intriguing are studies that tackle the mind-body
equation by finding links between severe stress and illnesses. A
large study published last year found that people who suffered
abuse in childhood, had a parent who was alcoholic, an addict or a
battered woman, or endured other stressful situations, were two to
four times more likely to suffer serious illnesses like heart
disease, emphysema, and stroke than other adults. The frequency of
disorders, the researchers reported, increased with the number of
``adverse childhood experiences'' a person had been exposed to.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists have found that veterans with post-traumatic
stress disorder also were more likely to suffer from a variety of
severe maladies, including heart disease and diseases of the
respiratory, digestive and musculoskeletal system than were
veterans without the stress disorder. An artificial division
between conditions that belong to ``psychiatry'' and those that
belong to ``medicine'' is ``nonsense,'' said Dr. Matthew Friedman,
executive director of the National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder, ``because stress is something that happens to the brain.
It's not something in the ether that happens to the mind. Stress is
very real. It has lots of medical effects. It also has
psychological effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuroscientists, who are slowly unraveling the complex
interrelationship of genetics, chemistry and cellular function in
the brain, seem considerably more comfortable jettisoning the
dualism of Descartes than many clinicians in routine medical
specialities. With the help of new tools, including PET and MRI
scanning, gene knockouts and other technologies, they are revealing
the brain as much more plastic than was once thought. Brain
chemistry and structure, studies have shown, may be altered by
``psychological'' experiences, including learning and stress.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a much more integrated view of human functioning.
``We now realize that the brain is a lot more involved in governing
many different functions in the body,'' says Dr. Bruce McEwen,
director of the laboratory of endocrinology at Rockefeller
University and an expert on stress. ``Appetite, sleep, food intake,
emotions, health-promoting and self-destructive behaviors _ all
these things are both controlled by and in turn influence the
brain.''

 &UR; BC-R-2NDTAKE-HEALTH-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: the brain &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   McEwen's work offers clues to how stressful experience might
eventually translate into physical illness, and how treatments that
reduce stress might prove beneficial to health. Just as blood
pressure and heart rate adjust when a person moves from a lying to
a standing position, the body's approach to stress is
``allostatic.'' That is, it strives to preserve stability through
change, making adjustments in regulatory systems _ heart rate,
hormone levels, metabolism, immune system _ in response to both the
external and internal environment.
</P>
<P>
   How strong and how long-lasting a person's response to stress is
depends on a variety of factors, including genetics, overall health
and how the person perceives the stress. And stress can be helpful
as well as harmful: Acute stress can enhance immune responses. But
McEwen and his colleagues have demonstrated that if stress
accumulates over weeks or months, the body's stress system can
become stuck in a partially ``on'' mode, causing damage and
disrupting normal responses. Prolonged stress, the work of McEwen
and other researchers has shown, can permanently damage nerve cells
in an area of the brain called the hippocampus, lead to
abnormalities in glucose metabolism and immune function, and are
associated with post-traumatic stress disorder.
</P>
<P>
   If scientists are discovering such strong evidence of
reciprocity between body and mind, why is there still resistance?
The answer has as much to do with sociology and politics as it does
with knowledge. While the public seems to have softened its
dualistic view _ Americans made 629 million visits to alternative
medicine practitioners in 1997, more visits than to all primary
care physicians _ many doctors remain distrustful of treatments
that purport to achieve physical results through psychological
means.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, caution is appropriate. False hope does no one
good, and exaggeration and distortion of the benefits of
alternative therapies are common: There is virtually no evidence
that mental state can cause serious disease _ that ``repressed''
people are more likely to get cancer, for instance. Nor is there
any science to support the assertion that psychological techniques
can cure, as opposed to modifying a person's response to, illness.
``If someone tells you that you can cure your cancer by imaging it
in your head, don't believe them,'' Spiegel said, ``but if they
tell you that it might help you cope with the disease once you've
got it, and that it might have some effect on disease course, as
well as quality of life, that might well be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Dr. Joshua Smyth, lead author of last week's asthma
and rheumatoid arthritis study, cautioned that, ``The worst
possible thing would be if people heard about this study and
concluded that if they keep a journal their asthma will go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some adjustments to Descartes' wall seem inevitable. And
the refusal to accept any influence of mind on body appears, at
this juncture, more the product of stubbornness than sense. For the
diehard reductionist, said Dr. David Hufford, professor of
humanities and behavioral science at Penn State College of
medicine, ``anything more ideational or symbolic is seen as coarse,
crude, naive and ultimately mistaken _ even if it gets some
practical effects.''

 &HT;    BellSouth buys stake in Qwest
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BellSouth Corp. today announced plans to pay $3.5 billion for 10
percent of Qwest Communications, one of the nation's more ambitious
providers of high-speed data and long-distance services.
</P>
<P>
   The move, BellSouth's first acquisition in more than five years,
is aimed at improving BellSouth's readiness for global competition
in an industry in which big players have been teaming up to provide
ever greater muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sign that we want to enhance our great growth,'' F.
Duane Ackerman, BellSouth chairman and chief executive, said today
in a CNN interview. ``For us, it's about data, electronic commerce,
Web hosting, Internet telephony. It's also about an alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Although BellSouth officials have long shrugged off the notion
that they were under pressure to act, rivals have been getting
bigger and adding a range of services. Despite BellSouth's $23
billion a year in revenues and record profits, the company has gone
from the nation's largest regional phone company to the second
smallest. Meanwhile, BellSouth was starting to look like a muscular
boxer whose arms were just too short. The lion's share of BellSouth
revenues was still coming from its dominance of local service in
its nine-state region. While BellSouth stayed on the sidelines,
other regional Bells were bulking up.
</P>
<P>
   SBC purchased Pacific Telesis and Ameritech. Bell Atlantic has
swallowed Nynex and has a deal to buy GTE. Meanwhile, long-distance
rival AT&AMP;T has bought business provider Teleport and is making a
long-term bid for consumers by acquiring Tele-Communications Inc.,
a huge cable company. WorldCom bought MCI and a host of other
companies, putting much of its focus on high-speed services.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation is in the air: News about BellSouth and Qwest came
as European markets were roiled by word that two telecommunications
giants _ the national phone companies of Germany and Italy _ were
in merger talks.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Denver-based Qwest, in the works for several
months, gives BellSouth access to 18,500 miles of high-speed lines,
as well as LCI, which sells long-distance services. BellSouth,
which has still not won federal approval to offer long-distance
service, is limited to a 10 percent ownership of a long-distance
company.
</P>
<P>
   But the investment in Qwest gives BellSouth access to the
company's resources and offers a route to national long-distance,
as soon as BellSouth is permitted into that market. At the same
time, it gives Qwest a local service presence that it has lacked.
BellSouth is paying $94.50 a share for its stake in Qwest stock,
which closed Friday at $82 a share.

FINALLY A LITTLE GOOD PRESS FOR THE LOWLY SNAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because I'm behind on nearly everything in my life, I've only
recently caught up with the January issue of ``Animal Behaviour''
and the disclosure therein that snakes are smarter than we
thought. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No, I'm not dumber than you thought because I misspelled
``Behavior.'' ``Behaviour'' is the way the magazine spells it. And
no wonder. It's published in London. The English are always tossing
extra u's into various words. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they've got us Americans doing it, too. Just look at
the word various. What good is the u in there? Why, no good at all.
But just try spelling it varios(CQ) and see what happens. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I don't mean to be writing about the behavior of English
persons here. If I cared about that I'd read ``People Behaviour,''
just as, if I wanted to know about turnips, I'd read ``Vegetable
Behaviour,'' and so on. Rather, I mean to write about snakes, which
are definitely animals. Certainly the snake that used to live in my
house was. His name was Monty Python. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One day Monty escaped from the flimsy home his teen-age keeper
had constructed for him. I didn't sleep well for a week or more
until Monty's quite-dead remains were discovered in eternal rest
until the clothes dryer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which seemed pretty stupid to me. Why would you escape a nice
house where you got regular food only to wind up dead and probably
pretty hungry under a large home appliance? Well, unless you were a
dumb snake. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's why I'm a little skeptical about this ``Animal
Behaviour'' report on a study done by David Holtzman, a
neuroscientist at the University of Rochester, a fine New York
state institution I once attended part-time. I suppose had I known
it was the kind of school that countenanced snake handlers, I might
have made another choice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Holtzman studied 24 corn snakes _ which no doubt some of
you know better by their scientific name, ``Elaphe guttata
guttata,'' or by their other nickname, red rat snake. He and his
fellow snake scholars determined that these slithering things are
pretty bright, in a relative way of speaking. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Snakes,'' he says, ``exhibit spatial learning that rivals the
learning abilities of birds and rodents.'' I guess that's meant to
be a compliment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the things Holtzman did was to challenge the snakes to
escape from a black plastic tub about the size of a child's wading
pool. When my children were little it sometimes took them no longer
than 11 nanoseconds to escape from such a pool if one of them
realized the other one was doing something, well, indiscreet in the
pool. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The snakes, however, were slower. At first it took them 700
seconds to find the correct escape hole. But they worked that down
to about 400 seconds on the fourth day of testing, and some got out
in less than 30 seconds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Holtzman says he and his team found, to everyone's
surprise, that snakes use vision to locate places, not just ``the
chemical cues picked up by flicking their tongues out, as many
snake biologists assume.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rochester snake experimenters say all of this may help them
figure out how to offer new therapies for people with brain damage,
and maybe that's right. But my guess is they do this for the same
reason an Indianapolis 500 driver zooms around the track at 205 mph
_ because it's cool. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Snakes haven't had good press since one of them conned Eve into
eating the forbidden fruit. People instinctively dislike snakes. So
what could be cooler than to be able to tell people that your
professional career is dedicated to teaching snakes how to escape?
Well, unless it's to tell people you work for a magazine that
misspells its name. &QL;
</P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A funereal contrast in athletes
 &HT;    (For release April 21, 1999. Moving on commentary and sports
wires.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The weather was cool by Miami standards, overcast and
generally depressing. My wife was holed up in the front bedroom,
battling a strep throat and not wanting any company. It was just me
and the TV set.
</P>
<P>
   Following the repetitive litany of those Sunday morning talking
head programs in which every expert on the Kosovo situation seems
to be saying the right thing until the next expert comes on the
screen and says something different, there was the choice of old
movies, infomercials or sports.
</P>
<P>
   The great hockey player Wayne Gretzky was retiring Sunday, and
it was the second day of the professional football draft. With both
on TV, it was an opportunity to surf between them.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast became remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   As Gretzky skated around the ice to appreciative cheers in New
York City's Madison Square Garden, just several floors below _ the
same building, mind you _ the National Football League was dividing
up the last hundred or so prospects for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky epitomizes everything we want in a sports hero: talent,
modesty, family, gratefulness. He's a person I wish I could say is
the embodiment of an all-American hero, but he's Canadian; he's an
all-Canadian hero. How fortunate for Canada!
</P>
<P>
   When the network broke for a commercial, I switched over to the
draft just in time to see the Miami Dolphins select a running back
who has been kicked off teams at two colleges, has failed three
drug tests, has recently pleaded guilty to two counts of
unauthorized entry and two counts of simple assault, has five years
of suspended jail time, is on four years' probation, requires
weekly drug testing and periodic counseling, must make good on a
$2,500 debt owed to a battered women's shelter, is not allowed to
have any contact with his victims and is banned from walking onto
the Louisiana State University campus.
</P>
<P>
   So who would you rather have baby-sitting your kids, Wayne
Gretzky or Cecil Collins, a.k.a. Cecil the Diesel?
</P>
<P>
   The two represent the polar caps of the sports world.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, of course, never needed another chance; he didn't flub
the first one. But men like Collins and Darryl Strawberry _ another
sad sports story of last week _ constantly are being awarded an
opportunity to fall astray again, and be paid handsomely as well.
</P>
<P>
   I kept pushing the remote. There was Gretzky with his wife and
kids, his old teammates, the greats he played against _ all
admiring each other, the fans holding up signs thanking the great
athlete for his 20 years of professional hockey.
</P>
<P>
   And there was Jimmy Johnson, the coach of the Miami Dolphins,
defending his selection of Collins _ saying he had great football
potential and should have another chance. When the draft shifted to
the studio analysts, an interesting question was put to Marty
Schottenheimer, a former quality NFL coach: ``Should a football
coach be responsible for the conduct of his players both on and off
the field?''
</P>
<P>
   After hedging a bit, Schottenheimer agreed that the coach does
share a significant degree of responsibility. Last year, Johnson
brought another bad seed into the Dolphins camp, a running back
(and woman abuser) named Lawrence Phillips, who had unceremoniously
been booted from another NFL team for his failings both as a player
and a human being. Johnson gave Phillips another chance; he blew it
in a bar near Fort Lauderdale, another woman roughed up.
</P>
<P>
   He's now playing in the European league; someone gave him
another chance again. I'm all for giving a guy another chance, but
how many is ``another''?
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the afternoon, I stayed with Gretzky as he
played his final game. Often, my eyes turned misty when I thought
of what he has brought to the troubled world of sport and how we
will _ and should _ cherish this humble, great athlete.
</P>
<P>
   And then I thought of Collins; but just for a second, because
compared to Gretzky, that's all he was worth.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Serbs' feigned outrage at civilian casualties
sickens
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If real people weren't really being killed, the eruption of Serb
outrage at NATO's mistaken bombing of a caravan of fleeing Kosovars
could be amusing.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a government _ and increasingly, sad to say, a
population as well _ pretending for world consumption to be
distressed at NATO's accidental killing of the very people Serbia
itself is energetically and very, very purposely brutalizing.
</P>
<P>
   Even the fatalism embedded in the old saw that the first victim
of war is truth is strained by a whopper like that one. Yet make no
mistake: Serbia is scoring PR points with its phony indignation,
not least by its manipulation of the television images _ and by the
confidence it can have that most TV reporters are incapable of
modulating their reports with even a little perspective.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a year now _ and vigorously for going on a month _
the Serbian military and paramilitary have been been murdering
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. They have been burning down civilians'
homes. They have been leveling whole towns. They have forced well
more than half a million utterly unoffending noncombatants _ women,
children, the sick, the aged _ into dreary, often deathly marches
to forced exile. They rape. They steal the deportees' meager funds.
</P>
<P>
   Of none of this, of course, have the Serbs permitted any news
coverage. We know about the horrors second-hand, from the testimony
of the surviving victims. We have no images, except as we
reluctantly imagine them ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   But with NATO's misfire, Serbian authorities quickly hustled
reporters and camera crews to the site. The result was long
minutes, gratifying to Serbia, of gruesome pictures of the
grotesquely killed, the horribly wounded. And some reporters
furthered Slobodan Milosevic's game by treating NATO's early-on
confusion over just what had happened as if that were a cover-up
scandal in the making.
</P>
<P>
   To anyone who has been paying the slightest attention, it has
been clear that NATO has been going to extraordinary lengths to
minimize civilian casualties, even in culpable Serbia itself. The
caution has been inhibiting, especially in Kosovo, where NATO
planes have often held their fire rather than risk hitting the
civilians and nonmilitary facilities the Serbs use for cover.
</P>
<P>
   But as President Clinton, forced by the circumstances to
emphasize the obvious, said, this is war and in war, at best an
untidy business, even the greatest care can't prevent the
inevitable unintended damage and casualties. Many of the weapons
NATO is using may look like video games, but where they land there
is havoc and death that do not disappear when the game is over. The
weapons, and the crews, are good. They are not perfect.
</P>
<P>
   The air cover that Serbia is flying for its atrocity on the
ground is a propaganda war pressed on television, the scenes
stage-managed by what Serbia will allow to be shown (itself as
victim) and what it will not let be seen (itself as victimizer).
Television images are Serbia's air-to-ground missiles.

   INVESTORS: INTERVIEW WITH WARREN BUFFETT Warren Buffett, one of
the world's most successful investors, shares some of his secrets
in this interview. Above all, he says, he pays no attention to the
ups and downs of the stock market but focuses instead on individual
companies with good business concepts and sound management.
Buffett, whose investment firm Berkshire Hathaway controls cash
resources of $15 billion, also explains his latest venture : a
time-sharing arrangement through which firms or wealthy individuals
can have ready access to company jets, without the expense of
buying one. From Der Spiegel. 1,000 words. (English translation
available.) 3. DEALING WITH THE BOMB IN SOUTH ASIA Nuclear tests by
India and Pakistan last May were a double set-back : for security
on the subcontinent and worldwide non-proliferation efforts. U.S.
attempts to forge warmer relations with both countries were also
casualties of the blasts. The tests could spark a chain of
withdrawals from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, undermining
the international consensus against the spread of nuclear arms.
Cold War brinkmanship is no model for diplomacy. For their sake as
well as the world's, India and Pakistan need to stabilize their
nuclear rivalry at the lowest possible level, ban further tests and
embrace frequent, high-level bilateral talks to ease tensions. By
Strobe Talbott. From Foreign Affairs magazine. 4,000 words. 4. FROM

 &HT;    MOST MEDICARE PATIENTS DON'T GET NECESSARY PREVENTIVE CARE
 &HT;    Repeating a story first moved Friday in advance in (w)
Washington and (a) general news categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most elderly Americans do not receive important
preventive health care services paid for by Medicare, according to
a report issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care 1999 also found wide
variations in the levels of Medicare services provided from one
geographic region to another.
</P>
<P>
   The report looked primarily at the impact of Medicare's
fee-for-service program on the 27.7 million elderly enrolled in
1996. It generally did not count those enrolled in Medicare managed
care plans or the nearly 4 million disabled in the Medicare
program, which covers about 38 million Americans. And it did not
analyze the reasons behind the findings.
</P>
<P>
   The report looked at medical resources -- such as the number of
hospital beds, doctors and nurses -- as well as medical conditions
and the range of care provided to patients.
</P>
<P>
   One area where better quality can be achieved -- and Medicare
patients' health improved -- is in preventive services. The report
found fewer than one out of three women aged 65 to 69 received a
mammogram during 1995-96, and in some parts of the country the
ratio was one out of eight women.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than one out of eight Medicare beneficiaries received a
colorectal examination for cancer and fewer than half were given an
eye examination to detect the onslaught of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors recommend that the elderly receive a pneumonia
vaccination at least every 10 years, meaning 10 percent of the
elderly should receive the shot each year. The study found that
only 4.3 percent of beneficiaries were vaccinated in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be striving for close to 100 percent use of these
specific preventive services considering what we know about
prevention and detection,'' said Dr. John E. Wennberg, director of
the Center for the Evaluative Clinical Sciences at Dartmouth
Medical School and the Atlas' principal investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jonathan T. Lord, chief operating officer at the American
Hospital Association, said ``physicians and other providers should
see these data as an opportunity to make improvements and to work
together with their patients to make sure everyone is receiving
what are often life-saving preventive services.''
</P>
<P>
   The AHA subsidiary Health Forum publishes the Atlas, which
showed residents of some areas were 10 times more likely to undergo
certain surgical procedures than people elsewhere with the same
illness. For example, surgery to remove the prostate was nearly 10
times more likely in Baton Rouge, La., than in Binghamton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Such differences do not reflect illness rates, the study
concluded. ``Variations in the rates of the use of these procedures
reflect variations in practice style and in how physicians diagnose
and treat common clinical conditions,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   End-of-life treatment patterns also varied widely. In some
places, such as Miami, Fla., more than one-third of the Medicare
patients saw 10 or more doctors during their last six months of
life. In Bloomington, Ill., 1.3 percent of patients saw 10 or more
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital and medical resources also varied nationwide -- and so
did costs.
</P>
<P>
   In nine regions of the country, there were more than 4.5
hospital beds per 1,000 residents -- Minot, N.D., was highest with
5.1 -- while 11 regions had 1.7 or fewer beds per 1,000, with
Everett, Wash., lowest at 1.4.
</P>
<P>
   How much Medicare spent in each region also varied. While the
national average was $4,993 per patient, costs ranged from $9,033
in McAllen, Texas, to $3,074 in Lynchburg, Va.

KEEPING UP WITH THE JONES: CATHERINE ZETA-JONES IS MAKING STARDOM
WORK THE SECOND TIME AROUND

 Includes a color slide of Catherine Zeta-Jones in a scene from
``Entrapment.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Five years after she completed a fairly traditional 15 minutes
of fame and saw herself consigned to washed-up status, Catherine
Zeta-Jones doesn't look like a has-been.
 &HT;    Relaxed and apparently confident for an interview at Los
Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel, Zeta-Jones looks stunning and every
inch a movie star. Dressed in a black skirt and white shirt, she
flashes amber eyes accentuated by dark, smoky liner, her full lips
a deep, ruby red.
 &HT;    But she doesn't mind admitting that her second spin on fame's
merry-go-round _ this time in America instead of England _ has her
a little edgy.
 &HT;    ``I have to admit that I'm a bit nervous,'' she says.
 &HT;    The results should be in soon. Last summer's ``The Mask of
Zorro'' paid her way onto the Hollywood hot list, and two films in
the next four months should tell whether she has what it takes to
stay there: the jewel-thief movie ``Entrapment,'' which opens on
April 30, and Dreamworks' highly anticipated ``The Haunting,'' a
ghost story co-starring Liam Neeson that will open July 23.
 &HT;    If everything clicks, she'll have a chance to find out if the
American version of stardom is any better than the British version.
 &HT;    ``Oh, it can't be worse than the first time when I was famous,''
the 29-year-old Zeta-Jones says, rolling her eyes.
 &HT;    That came via stage success and a British television series,
``The Darling Buds of May.'' For a while there, Zeta-Jones was as
hot as anyone barely out of her teens could be _ though not as hot
as she may become, if her big-screen career takes off.
 &HT;    ``She is positioned to be a major movie star in the
old-fashioned sense of the word,'' says Anthony Hopkins, who played
her long-lost father in ``The Mask of Zorro.'' ``I think Catherine
is a return to old-fashioned movie-goddess time, which we've been
lacking for years.''
 &HT;    She's appearing opposite an old-fashion movie god, Sean Connery,
in ``Entrapment,'' which casts them as rival art thieves who team
up in business and, of course, in romance.
 &HT;    Her pairing with the 69-year-old Connery has provoked some
controversy, but Zeta-Jones simply shrugs.
 &HT;    ``I've heard a lot of, `Oh, it's the older-man/younger-woman
thing again,''' she says. ``But it's really more business partners,
which I think is interesting. I'm high tech and he comes from the
old school of thieving.''
 &HT;    Besides, Zeta-Jones wasn't in any position to argue with the
casting, since it was Connery _ in his capacity as producer _ who
went to bat for her in the part.
 &HT;    Twentieth Century Fox wanted a bigger name for the role, but
Connery remembered Zeta-Jones from the little-seen action film
``The Phantom'' (1996) and invited her to Rome for a reading.
 &HT;    ``I was so nervous,'' Zeta-Jones admits. ``But I always get
nervous before I shoot or go on stage. I just have stage fright all
the time, which I think is great. I'm sure if I lost that I'd
completely fall apart. I think my nerves are my edge.''
 &HT;    Meeting Connery put her at ease, she says.
 &HT;    ``He was exactly the way I imagined him,'' the actress recalls.
``That was great, because you have such high expectations of icons
and, if you meet them and they're a pain in the a--, it's so
upsetting.''
 &HT;    Zeta-Jones got the part, and the box-office numbers for
``Zorro'' soothed the studio heads. She was quickly off to sets in
such exotic locales as Malaysia, Hong Kong and Scotland _ quite a
tour for the native of Swansea, Wales, a small fishing town where
she grew up with a seamstress mother and candy-factory-manager
father.
 &HT;    ``People get so confused and think the family is British,'' she
says. ``We're really black Welsh. I'm Tom Jones kind of Welsh.''
 &HT;    Swansea did have something of an artistic tradition _ its gifts
to the world include Dylan Thomas and Anthony Hopkins _ and she
began acting as a child with the Dylan Thomas Theater Group.
 &HT;    ``Afterward, I fell for those big publicity stunts where someone
would put up a poster to find a kid for a play in London,'' she
recalls.
 &HT;    Most kids who responded never even got an audition. But at age
11 she got the lead in ``Annie,'' and soon found herself a child
star in London. ``Bugsy Malone'' and ``The Pajama Game'' led to the
now-teen-age Zeta-Jones winning an understudy role in ``42nd
Street'' and moving up to the lead, which she played for two years.
 &HT;    ``I loved doing the musical. That was my dream,'' Zeta-Jones
says. ``As a young girl, I never, never, never saw myself as a
movie star. I always wanted to be a theater actress.''
 &HT;    But ``42nd Street's'' eight performances a week left her
exhausted, and she decided to look into straight acting. At 19,
Zeta-Jones was cast in ``The Darling Buds of May,'' the story of a
decadent 1950s family, and she awoke to find herself a teen idol,
the object of affection for 23 million fans.
 &HT;    ``There was puppy fat all over my face _ I wasn't that pretty,''
she says, still bemused by it. ``My life changed drastically. The
press attention I got was unbelievable _ every time I had a coffee
with someone, he became the new love of my life, we were
immediately talking marriage and children. I was dating royalty and
sheiks.
 &HT;    ``It became ridiculous. I was only 20.''
 &HT;    The capper came when four paparazzi cars converged on
Zeta-Jones' car as she emerged from a studio parking lot.
Panicking, she hit the gas and swung onto a side street.
 &HT;    ``I was looking in the mirror to see if they were still behind
me,'' the actress recalls, ``when suddenly a lamp post came up.''
 &HT;    The next thing she heard was grinding metal and the sound of
shattering glass falling into her lap. The photographers approached
the car only to snap a few pictures, then drove away without
bothering even to check if she was hurt.
 &HT;    ``It was so intimidating that I wanted to quit show business,''
she recalls.
 &HT;    Instead, she moved to Malibu, Calif., and started over, sleeping
in a pal's closet while trying to launch an American career.
Meanwhile, one London tabloid wrote: ``Poor Catherine Zeta-Jones is
a has-been at age 24.''
 &HT;    ``I was sleeping in my friend's closet, but it still bothered me
that I was suddenly labeled a failure back home,'' she says, still
nettled. ``I recall the word `loser' being used.''
 &HT;    ``The Phantom'' didn't do much for her career. Nor did ``The
Titanic,'' a 1997 CBS miniseries that beat James Cameron's epic
film on the calendar but nowhere else.
 &HT;    ``The Mask of Zorro'' was another story, offering romantic
scenes with Antonio Banderas, touching ones with Hopkins and even a
major sword-fighting sequence.
 &HT;    ``I trained so hard with the sword,'' she recalls. ``In the end,
one arm was toned and my non-fighting arm was so flabby. I also got
to ride horses and learn Spanish _ it was a fabulous experience.''
 &HT;    Ditto her love scenes with Connery, who dazzled her with his
technical skill.
 &HT;    ``He held my face and my chin just in the right position, so my
profile would look really fabulous,'' she says. ``Sean held my back
just right, so I would arch in this sexy way. He was fabulous and
very sexy.''
 &HT;    She giggles.
 &HT;    ``It made me glad I didn't quit acting.''

   Not Ricky Schroder? The adorable tyke from ``The Champ'' (1979)
and the 1980s sitcom ``Silver Spoons?''
</P>
<P>
   No, definitely not Ricky. Right from his first entrance as
Detective Danny Sorenson, Schroder vividly brought to life a cop
who was young, but old enough to have demons of his own. No
adorable tykes need apply.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate stamp of approval came from ``Mr. NYPD Blue''
himself, Emmy Award winner Dennis Franz, who plays Detective Andy
Sipowicz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis told me today, `Rick, it's finally done. You're part of
the show _ the transition worked,''' Schroder says. ``That was cool
for him to say that to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The series' ratings have actually risen since his arrival, which
Schroder writes off to people's curiosity about impending disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation level for me to fail was so great,'' he says,
``that when I didn't fail, it was a bigger deal than it would've
been if there hadn't been any expectations for me.''
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, relaxing over a French-dip brisket sandwich at a
West Los Angeles deli, Schroder has no complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know sometimes, when you have a dream, it comes true and
it's not as good as you imagined?'' he says. ``This one's as
good.''
</P>
<P>
   The most disorienting aspect of the show, the actor says, may be
that he had to begin by filming disconnected snippets from a number
of episodes during the show's annual trek to New York for location
shooting _ which actually wasn't so different from normal, since
co-creator David Milch prefers not to give actors their scripts
much ahead of time. It adds to the show's energy and spontaneity,
he claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way he writes,'' Schroder says with a shrug. ``You
don't get the whole episode, ever. You're lucky if you get your
scenes the night before you shoot them. So you don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way they want it,'' he says. ``It's hard to
prepare, but I learned early on, you've got to trust the men
involved with the show. You've got to give up some of your
control.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his character, Schroder says the writers have based it to
a considerable extent on the actor himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess a lot of what people like is just me being me,'' he
says. ``There's a lot of me in Sorenson. It's not forced _ I'm not
acting a lot of the time. It's not that big a stretch for me. I've
had a full life already, and a lot of it I was just born that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people out there, executives at networks,
that wanted me to do a real stock family show,'' he adds, ``and
that's not what I wanted to do. I was proud of myself that I was
patient and waited, I had opportunities to do other shows, and I
was just really, really lucky to get this one. Because it's
everything I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing a cop is a challenge, however, because of the kind of
life-or-death situations that his character regularly encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, when they're getting ready to roll and you're
sitting there with your own thoughts _ like 30 seconds, 10 seconds
before a take _ you'll do crazy sh-t in your head, your
imagination,'' Schroder says. ``If you have to get excited or
tensed up or hyped up for a scene where you know you can meet a
bullet, you might want to say four-letter words in your head 10
seconds before the take. Or think nasty thoughts about the guy
that's going to put bullets in you. And just fantasize in a sense.
That'll get you in the mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I could've been a cop,'' he says. ``Where I grew up in
New York, a lot of cops and firemen were friends of the family. I'd
gone on ride-alongs and always liked cops. I just like the guys
they are _ they're very can-do, and I respond to that sort of
attitude, I like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York cops are huge fans of the show,'' he adds.
``We're treated like royalty. And they really opened up _ you'd be
surprised. They really told you stories about the real way they do
their job, not the way they show everybody, and stuff that probably
could've gotten them in a lot of trouble when it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   If the cops had any reservations about the former Ricky joining
the ranks of television police officers, they kept them to
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't say much,'' Schroder says. ``I mean, they were
friendly as could be and they were big fans of mine, but they
didn't say much about, `Oh yeah, kid, you're gonna do great.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they believed that, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   The steel and concrete of Manhattan is a long way from
Schroder's home, a 500-acre Colorado ranch which he bought in 1990
after visiting the area to film ``Return to Lonesome Dove.'' He was
20, and knew nothing whatever about ranching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all new,'' he recalls. ``I fell in love with the
Southwest. It took two years to find the perfect ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never my intention to live there,'' he adds. ``It was
my intention to have it as a second home, a place to go visit and
enjoy. Then we had our first baby, and we built a house and just
never left. Before I knew it, I'd been ranching for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now on my ranch there's 400 pairs of cattle,'' the actor
says. ``A pair is a mother and a baby. We pull calves (assist in a
birth) sometimes _ I've done that. I've actually had my hand up to
my shoulder inside of a cow pulling on calves, literally putting
your feet up on her butt and trying to pull it out. I love working
the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go home every weekend,'' he adds. ``I've only missed two
weekends in seven months. I'm very proud of that.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Schroder seems to have survived child stardom better
than most, but he doesn't have similar aspirations for his
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't let my kids do it, no,'' he says thoughtfully.
``But I'm glad I did it. I mean, it's cool. It's an interesting
life. I'm just protecting them from, I guess, losing those very
special young carefree years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I lost all mine,'' he adds, ``but it was tough
to be a normal kid and have normal experiences, doing what I was
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother did the best she could to provide a normal childhood,
Schroder recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never made me be a little professional,'' he says. ``She
let me be a boy. She let me get messy and she let me get in
trouble. When Universal sent letters to the production company
about me terrorizing the tour buses on the Universal Studios back
lot, setting off the `Jaws' exhibition by myself and all these
other crazy things I did growing up on Universal's lot, she would
just ignore them or rip them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew you're supposed to have fun, you're supposed to get
in trouble.''

 Includes a color slide of rock bassist Bill Wyman. 
 By SCOTT COOPER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Bill Wyman quit the Rolling Stones seven years ago, but he's
still a Stone at heart.
 &HT;    Wyman may no longer be holding down the simple, steady bass
lines to anchor Mick Jagger's sexy singing and Keith Richards'
raunchy guitar riffs, as he did for 31 years. But he's still the
unofficial historian for a group that has plenty of history.
 &HT;    ``I think they appreciate that someone keeps a record for
posterity,'' Wyman says.
 &HT;    His collection of Stones memorabilia was a great source for his
1990 memoir, ``Stone Alone,'' but it also adorns the walls of
Wyman's three British restaurants _ which bear the name Sticky
Fingers, lifted from one of the band's greatest records.
 &HT;    The Stones have kept rolling without their founding bassist, but
they keep him involved by sending packages of tour programs,
stickers, tickets, T-shirts and even the daily newsletter,
providing an insider's look at the life of a Rolling Stone.
 &HT;    ``When you're on tour, you get your daily newsletter stuffed
under your door every morning, which tells you everything that's
going on that day, even if there's nothing going on,'' the bassist
explains. ``It tells you where you are, what you're doing, where
the good restaurants are if you want to go, the good shopping
areas, and there's the doctor's phone number if you need him.''
 &HT;    Wyman doesn't miss receiving that newsletter directly, he
hastens to add.
 &HT;    ``I hated traveling in hotels and suitcases and living in
airports and hotel rooms,'' he recalls. ``I loved the times on
stage, of course _ that's the thing you do. All the rest of that's
bulls--t that goes around that. You have to deal with that for the
other 22 hours of the day, and then you only play once every three
days, so it's even longer.
 &HT;    ``It just used to drive me nuts,'' the bassist adds. ``But then
you couldn't go out, because people knew you were in town and the
hotel was surrounded and all that. So you ended up in the room all
the time. If you were lucky, you might go to a restaurant very late
on.''
 &HT;    This de-facto incarceration was only one of the restrictions
that came with membership in one of the biggest rock 'n' roll bands
ever. Wyman was equally frustrated by the fact that almost all of
the band's songs were written by Jagger and Richards.
 &HT;    ``You did an album every 18 months,'' Wyman says. ``You had two
writers who wrote bloody good songs for the band over the years.
You had nine or 10 songs to record for the album, and 30 songs
ready when you arrived at the studio. So there was no room for
anybody else to write, really.''
 &HT;    Even though he respects their songwriting talents, Wyman felt
that the Jagger-Richards songs eventually began to lose their
individuality.
 &HT;    ``Track after track tended to start the same as the tracks on
the last album,'' he says. ``There was nothing fresh coming through
for me.''
 &HT;    The only original Stone to leave the band before Wyman was
founder and multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, who quit shortly
before his drug-related death in 1969.
 &HT;    ``If Brian hadn't died,'' Wyman says, ``I think the band would
have probably broken up in the '70s. Brian was very susceptible to
experimenting with substances, and Keith's the same. So you
wouldn't have ended up carrying one junkie _ you'd be carrying two,
and it wouldn't have worked.''
 &HT;    Jones' replacement, guitarist Mick Taylor, left the band in 1975
after experiencing frustrations similar to Wyman's. In stepped
guitarist Ron Wood, whom Wyman also credits as the current group's
peacemaker, a ``catalyst'' responsible for keeping the harmony
among a group of strong personalities who aren't averse to
squabbles, major and minor.
 &HT;    His own departure, Wyman says, was primarily a result of his
``horrendous'' personal life during the late 1980s. After leaving
the band he remarried, and he and his wife are now raising three
girls.
 &HT;    ``We've got a lovely family now,'' the musician says. ``It's
just great to be around them.''
 &HT;    When Wyman quit the Stones in 1991, he adds, they didn't believe
him.
 &HT;    ``They left the door open for me right up until four months
before they started working in '94,'' he recalls. ``Then Mick and
Charlie (Watts, the band's drummer) came around and spent the
evening with me. I said, `But I left two years ago, I really did. I
did leave.'
 &HT;    ``But when I make decisions, they're decisions.''
 &HT;    In spite of their famous internal struggles, Wyman adds, the
Stones remain tight.
 &HT;    ``We're great mates and we see each other a lot, even in the
present day,'' he says. ``When Charlie's in town he comes around
for dinner. And I go to see them and stay with them over the
weekend. We're still great friends. It's not sour grapes _ it just
doesn't really interest me any more.''
 &HT;    What does interest Wyman varies wildly _ television
documentaries, blues history, archeology, astrology, photography,
art and his family among them. This marks a big difference between
him and the other Stones, he says.
 &HT;    ``I think the problem is, knowing them quite well, there's very
little else they like to do,'' Wyman says. ``Some of them have got
one other interest: Ron is into art. He has his exhibitions and
he's good at it. Mick's been trying on and off over the years to be
involved in movies, either as an actor or a producer or whatever.
That's his other interest _ apart from girls. And Charlie's into
jazz. He has a little jazz band that he plays with when the Stones
aren't working _ that's his hobby.
 &HT;    ``But that's about it,'' he concludes. ``I don't think Keith's
got anything else that's as interesting for him. He plays with
other people a bit, but it's music again.''
 &HT;    Wyman may have left the Stones, but he defends the band against
its detractors, many of whom claim that Jagger and Richards are
simply too old to live up to their own past.
 &HT;    ``Rock 'n' roll hasn't been going long enough for there to be
elder statesmen until now,'' he says. ``It's not like jazz, which
was going from the turn of the century. You had Louis Armstrong and
all those people playing when they were ancient, because the music
let them grow up and get old in it.
 &HT;    ``But this is the first time in rock 'n' roll that people have
got to the 50s and 60s,'' he says. ``There was never an opportunity
for people to grow old within that music before, because it didn't
exist before 1953 or 1954.
 &HT;    ``I don't really think of it as a young person's music,'' the
bassist says. ``The only thing that relates it to young people is
the energy that a lot of young performers put into it and make it
really stand out, which maybe we don't achieve quite as well as we
did when we were younger.''
 &HT;    So instead of testing his own theory of youth, Wyman has opted
to follow Armstrong's example. He recently released a CD of jazz
and blues titled ``Anyway the Wind Blows,'' featuring cameos from
Eric Clapton, Peter Frampton and even Mick Taylor.
 &HT;    ``When you get into semiretirement like I am _ although I'm
working my a-- off more than I've ever worked in my life and loving
every minute of it,'' the former Rolling Stone says, ``I can record
that kind of stuff and play on stage.
 &HT;    ``I'm not worrying about chart positions and pleasing record
labels and having a radio hit anymore.''

 Includes a color slide of Christian Bale with Emily Watson in a
scene from ``Metroland.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Christian Bale won his latest role by a hair. Or, rather, by his
lack of same.
 &HT;    Really.
 &HT;    In Philip Saville's drama ``Metroland,'' opening across the
country through April and May, the 27-year-old Bale plays one
character at three ages _ 18, 23 and 31.
 &HT;    ``A week before filming started, Philip Saville called and said,
`Christian, do you have a hairy chest?''' says the soft-spoken
Bale, best known for his debut role as a British boy in a Japanese
prison camp in ``Empire of the Sun'' (1987). ``I said, `No,' and
Philip said, `Wonderful, would you like to play all three roles?''
 &HT;    Bale laughs.
 &HT;    ``I didn't know what the connection was, and I still don't,'' he
says. ``I just liked the challenge of playing three versions of the
same character.''
 &HT;    Based on Julian Barnes' 1980 novel, ``Metroland'' centers on
pals Chris (Bale) and Toni (Lee Ross), growing up in the late 1960s
in a suburban section of London called Metroland. The two start out
seeking adventure, but Chris ends up marrying, moving back to
Metroland and fathering a child, while Toni lives an exciting life,
crisscrossing the globe.
 &HT;    When Toni returns for a visit, it prompts Chris to wonder
whether or not he's truly happy.
 &HT;    ``It's a character study about two friends, their idealism and
black-and-white viewpoints of life,'' Bale says. ``I found it quite
nice that the younger Chris is forthright and believes he knows
exactly what he's about and then, by 30, life has taught him there
are a lot more answers to every question than he originally
thought.
 &HT;    ``The older he gets, the less he knows himself,'' the actor
says. ``Situations and perspectives change, but why? Did you
compromise? Did you lose your passion and will?
 &HT;    ``And if you answer that, how do you deal with your answers? Is
it all right to feel content being a 32-year-old, married father
who may not have fulfilled a lot of his dreams?''
 &HT;    Bale couldn't exactly relate to Chris' doubts, though.
 &HT;    ``I never had a place I wanted to escape from,'' he says during
an interview at the Manhattan office of ``Metroland's''
distributor, Lions Gate Films. ``I also don't have straitlaced
parents.
 &HT;    ``My ultimate rebellion would be to get a job at a bank,'' he
says with a laugh. ``My parents are not boring, and I've never
said, `Oh, Christ, I never want to become like them.' My mom was in
the circus for a while, and my dad was a pilot. He took a 9-to-5
job for two weeks and went mad.
 &HT;    ``He essentially does whatever he feels like doing,'' Bale says.
``At times that wasn't fun, like when we were sitting in trucks
outside a house we'd just gotten kicked out of. Other times, things
were going well and we moved to Portugal for a bit.
 &HT;    ``But I think anyone can empathize with the idea of not being
able to see the woods from the trees until somebody kicks you in
the a--.''
 &HT;    Even with critical raves _ not to mention the presence of
two-time Oscar nominee Emily Watson as Chris' wife _ ``Metroland''
faces an uphill battle at the box office. Bale agrees, but doesn't
mind.
 &HT;    ``I have to make the experience of making a film the most
important thing,'' he says. ``I don't ever want to not make a film
I'd be interested in watching because the audience for it may be
limited.''
 &HT;    Indeed, a glance at Bale's credits reveals a preponderance of
art-house films. There's ``Henry V'' (1989), ``Portrait of a Lady''
(1996), ``Velvet Goldmine'' (1998) and the upcoming ``William
Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' His occasional studio
films have included ``Swing Kids'' (1993) and ``Little Women''
(1994).
 &HT;    ``My doing studio films just hasn't happened very often,'' Bale
says. ``It's not a conscious thing.
 &HT;    ``I started out with the luxury of `Empire,''' he adds. ``There
was a huge amount of money _ we had time to do take after take
until we got it right. Now, with my smaller films, I've gotten used
to getting two or three takes and moving on. It's bang-bang-bang,
and that's good for an actor.
 &HT;    ```Metroland' was done in 26 days,'' he concludes. ``I met the
director two days before we started, and we had no rehearsal.''
 &HT;    ``Empire of the Sun,'' directed by Steven Spielberg, made Bale a
star and a teen idol, but he still grimaces at the mention of it.
 &HT;    ``It feels like a long time ago,'' says the actor, who's single
and splits his time between London and Los Angeles. ``It was a
great experience making it.
 &HT;    ``It's a good thing feeling the distance,'' he adds, ``because I
can see the good aspects again. There was a period where I sort of
resented it, because of the sudden lack of anonymity. At 14, I
didn't want people pointing at me.''
 &HT;    The actor responded to the spotlight's glare by retreating into
his private life and working primarily in smaller films that were
less likely to draw attention to himself.
 &HT;    ``I've never wanted and was never prepared for a lot of volume
about myself,'' he says. ``Having had so much volume after `Empire'
and having hated it so much, I'm sure that affected me.
 &HT;    ``It didn't touch my love of acting, but it made me question
everything else.''
 &HT;    The answer, clearly, has been to avoid teen-heartthrob roles.
His next film, ``All the Little Animals,'' casts him as a mentally
handicapped youth who befriends a reclusive animal lover (John
Hurt).
 &HT;    Next up is an even less boyishly charming role, as the title
character in ``American Psycho,'' based on Bret Easton Ellis' novel
about a brutal serial killer.
 &HT;    Hardly the stuff of teen dreams, but it briefly attracted the
high-profile attention of current idol Leonardo DiCaprio last year.
Bale and director Mary Harron, who had been committed to the
project for years, suddenly found themselves on the verge of being
ousted from what would suddenly have become a ``big'' picture.
 &HT;    ``I didn't feel like a pawn,'' Bale says. ``I always felt it was
more my film than anyone else's short of Mary. People told me to
forget about it, but I always believed I'd end up doing it, and
Mary did as well.
 &HT;    ``The whole thing, frankly, has become the most boring
subject,'' he says. ``I'm doing the film.''
 &HT;    The subject matter has also drawn considerable controversy _ the
novel, after all, was widely condemned as exploitive
quasi-pornography.
 &HT;    Bale rejects criticism from anyone who hasn't seen the film _
which, these days, includes everyone.
 &HT;    ``The film will be powerful,'' he says. ``It's a psychological
thriller about a serial killer, yet it's funny. That's an
incredible dichotomy _ it's funny and cold and ugly, often
simultaneously.
 &HT;    ``I've never experienced anything like it as an actor,'' he
says. ``I'm trying to make people laugh and hate me, really, at the
same time.''
 &HT;    Bale doesn't envy DiCaprio's cover-boy status. On the other
hand, he'd like to boost his own profile _ just a bit.
 &HT;    ``I'd love to be in a position where people don't say, `You'd be
great in this, but we've got to cast So-and-So,''' he says. ``I'd
like to be So-and-So.
 &HT;    ``I'd like to be in a position where people say, `Here's the
money. Christian Bale can be in it.' I think that's where I'm at
with independent films, and ... well, I just don't want to have any
more situations like `American Psycho.'''

 Includes a color slide of Catherine Zeta-Jones in a scene from
``Entrapment.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Five years after she completed a fairly traditional 15 minutes
of fame and saw herself consigned to washed-up status, Catherine
Zeta-Jones doesn't look like a has-been.
 &HT;    Relaxed and apparently confident for an interview at Los
Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel, Zeta-Jones looks stunning and every
inch a movie star. Dressed in a black skirt and white shirt, she
flashes amber eyes accentuated by dark, smoky liner, her full lips
a deep, ruby red.
 &HT;    But she doesn't mind admitting that her second spin on fame's
merry-go-round _ this time in America instead of England _ has her
a little edgy.
 &HT;    ``I have to admit that I'm a bit nervous,'' she says.
 &HT;    The results should be in soon. Last summer's ``The Mask of
Zorro'' paid her way onto the Hollywood hot list, and two films in
the next four months should tell whether she has what it takes to
stay there: the jewel-thief movie ``Entrapment,'' which opens on
April 30, and Dreamworks' highly anticipated ``The Haunting,'' a
ghost story co-starring Liam Neeson that will open July 23.
 &HT;    If everything clicks, she'll have a chance to find out if the
American version of stardom is any better than the British version.
 &HT;    ``Oh, it can't be worse than the first time when I was famous,''
the 29-year-old Zeta-Jones says, rolling her eyes.
 &HT;    That came via stage success and a British television series,
``The Darling Buds of May.'' For a while there, Zeta-Jones was as
hot as anyone barely out of her teens could be _ though not as hot
as she may become, if her big-screen career takes off.
 &HT;    ``She is positioned to be a major movie star in the
old-fashioned sense of the word,'' says Anthony Hopkins, who played
her long-lost father in ``The Mask of Zorro.'' ``I think Catherine
is a return to old-fashioned movie-goddess time, which we've been
lacking for years.''
 &HT;    She's appearing opposite an old-fashion movie god, Sean Connery,
in ``Entrapment,'' which casts them as rival art thieves who team
up in business and, of course, in romance.
 &HT;    Her pairing with the 69-year-old Connery has provoked some
controversy, but Zeta-Jones simply shrugs.
 &HT;    ``I've heard a lot of, `Oh, it's the older-man/younger-woman
thing again,''' she says. ``But it's really more business partners,
which I think is interesting. I'm high tech and he comes from the
old school of thieving.''
 &HT;    Besides, Zeta-Jones wasn't in any position to argue with the
casting, since it was Connery _ in his capacity as producer _ who
went to bat for her in the part.
 &HT;    Twentieth Century Fox wanted a bigger name for the role, but
Connery remembered Zeta-Jones from the little-seen action film
``The Phantom'' (1996) and invited her to Rome for a reading.
 &HT;    ``I was so nervous,'' Zeta-Jones admits. ``But I always get
nervous before I shoot or go on stage. I just have stage fright all
the time, which I think is great. I'm sure if I lost that I'd
completely fall apart. I think my nerves are my edge.''
 &HT;    Meeting Connery put her at ease, she says.
 &HT;    ``He was exactly the way I imagined him,'' the actress recalls.
``That was great, because you have such high expectations of icons
and, if you meet them and they're a pain in the a--, it's so
upsetting.''
 &HT;    Zeta-Jones got the part, and the box-office numbers for
``Zorro'' soothed the studio heads. She was quickly off to sets in
such exotic locales as Malaysia, Hong Kong and Scotland _ quite a
tour for the native of Swansea, Wales, a small fishing town where
she grew up with a seamstress mother and candy-factory-manager
father.
 &HT;    ``People get so confused and think the family is British,'' she
says. ``We're really black Welsh. I'm Tom Jones kind of Welsh.''
 &HT;    Swansea did have something of an artistic tradition _ its gifts
to the world include Dylan Thomas and Anthony Hopkins _ and she
began acting as a child with the Dylan Thomas Theater Group.
 &HT;    ``Afterward, I fell for those big publicity stunts where someone
would put up a poster to find a kid for a play in London,'' she
recalls.
 &HT;    Most kids who responded never even got an audition. But at age
11 she got the lead in ``Annie,'' and soon found herself a child
star in London. ``Bugsy Malone'' and ``The Pajama Game'' led to the
now-teen-age Zeta-Jones winning an understudy role in ``42nd
Street'' and moving up to the lead, which she played for two years.
 &HT;    ``I loved doing the musical. That was my dream,'' Zeta-Jones
says. ``As a young girl, I never, never, never saw myself as a
movie star. I always wanted to be a theater actress.''
 &HT;    But ``42nd Street's'' eight performances a week left her
exhausted, and she decided to look into straight acting. At 19,
Zeta-Jones was cast in ``The Darling Buds of May,'' the story of a
decadent 1950s family, and she awoke to find herself a teen idol,
the object of affection for 23 million fans.
 &HT;    ``There was puppy fat all over my face _ I wasn't that pretty,''
she says, still bemused by it. ``My life changed drastically. The
press attention I got was unbelievable _ every time I had a coffee
with someone, he became the new love of my life, we were
immediately talking marriage and children. I was dating royalty and
sheiks.
 &HT;    ``It became ridiculous. I was only 20.''
 &HT;    The capper came when four paparazzi cars converged on
Zeta-Jones' car as she emerged from a studio parking lot.
Panicking, she hit the gas and swung onto a side street.
 &HT;    ``I was looking in the mirror to see if they were still behind
me,'' the actress recalls, ``when suddenly a lamp post came up.''
 &HT;    The next thing she heard was grinding metal and the sound of
shattering glass falling into her lap. The photographers approached
the car only to snap a few pictures, then drove away without
bothering even to check if she was hurt.
 &HT;    ``It was so intimidating that I wanted to quit show business,''
she recalls.
 &HT;    Instead, she moved to Malibu, Calif., and started over, sleeping
in a pal's closet while trying to launch an American career.
Meanwhile, one London tabloid wrote: ``Poor Catherine Zeta-Jones is
a has-been at age 24.''
 &HT;    ``I was sleeping in my friend's closet, but it still bothered me
that I was suddenly labeled a failure back home,'' she says, still
nettled. ``I recall the word `loser' being used.''
 &HT;    ``The Phantom'' didn't do much for her career. Nor did ``The
Titanic,'' a 1997 CBS miniseries that beat James Cameron's epic
film on the calendar but nowhere else.
 &HT;    ``The Mask of Zorro'' was another story, offering romantic
scenes with Antonio Banderas, touching ones with Hopkins and even a
major sword-fighting sequence.
 &HT;    ``I trained so hard with the sword,'' she recalls. ``In the end,
one arm was toned and my non-fighting arm was so flabby. I also got
to ride horses and learn Spanish _ it was a fabulous experience.''
 &HT;    Ditto her love scenes with Connery, who dazzled her with his
technical skill.
 &HT;    ``He held my face and my chin just in the right position, so my
profile would look really fabulous,'' she says. ``Sean held my back
just right, so I would arch in this sexy way. He was fabulous and
very sexy.''
 &HT;    She giggles.
 &HT;    ``It made me glad I didn't quit acting.''

NEW BLUE: RICK SCHRODER IS `NYPD BLUE'S' LATEST ROOKIE

 Includes a color slide of Rick Schroder with Dennis Franz in a
scene from ``NYPD Blue.'' 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't call him Little Boy Blue.
</P>
<P>
   Eyebrows were raised across America when producer Steven Bochco
announced that Rick Schroder would be Jimmy Smits' replacement on
the long-running ABC hit, ``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Ricky Schroder? The adorable tyke from ``The Champ'' (1979)
and the 1980s sitcom ``Silver Spoons?''
</P>
<P>
   No, definitely not Ricky. Right from his first entrance as
Detective Danny Sorenson, Schroder vividly brought to life a cop
who was young, but old enough to have demons of his own. No
adorable tykes need apply.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate stamp of approval came from ``Mr. NYPD Blue''
himself, Emmy Award winner Dennis Franz, who plays Detective Andy
Sipowicz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis told me today, `Rick, it's finally done. You're part of
the show _ the transition worked,''' Schroder says. ``That was cool
for him to say that to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The series' ratings have actually risen since his arrival, which
Schroder writes off to people's curiosity about impending disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation level for me to fail was so great,'' he says,
``that when I didn't fail, it was a bigger deal than it would've
been if there hadn't been any expectations for me.''
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, relaxing over a French-dip brisket sandwich at a
West Los Angeles deli, Schroder has no complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know sometimes, when you have a dream, it comes true and
it's not as good as you imagined?'' he says. ``This one's as
good.''
</P>
<P>
   The most disorienting aspect of the show, the actor says, may be
that he had to begin by filming disconnected snippets from a number
of episodes during the show's annual trek to New York for location
shooting _ which actually wasn't so different from normal, since
co-creator David Milch prefers not to give actors their scripts
much ahead of time. It adds to the show's energy and spontaneity,
he claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way he writes,'' Schroder says with a shrug. ``You
don't get the whole episode, ever. You're lucky if you get your
scenes the night before you shoot them. So you don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way they want it,'' he says. ``It's hard to
prepare, but I learned early on, you've got to trust the men
involved with the show. You've got to give up some of your
control.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his character, Schroder says the writers have based it to
a considerable extent on the actor himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess a lot of what people like is just me being me,'' he
says. ``There's a lot of me in Sorenson. It's not forced _ I'm not
acting a lot of the time. It's not that big a stretch for me. I've
had a full life already, and a lot of it I was just born that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people out there, executives at networks,
that wanted me to do a real stock family show,'' he adds, ``and
that's not what I wanted to do. I was proud of myself that I was
patient and waited, I had opportunities to do other shows, and I
was just really, really lucky to get this one. Because it's
everything I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing a cop is a challenge, however, because of the kind of
life-or-death situations that his character regularly encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, when they're getting ready to roll and you're
sitting there with your own thoughts _ like 30 seconds, 10 seconds
before a take _ you'll do crazy sh-t in your head, your
imagination,'' Schroder says. ``If you have to get excited or
tensed up or hyped up for a scene where you know you can meet a
bullet, you might want to say four-letter words in your head 10
seconds before the take. Or think nasty thoughts about the guy
that's going to put bullets in you. And just fantasize in a sense.
That'll get you in the mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I could've been a cop,'' he says. ``Where I grew up in
New York, a lot of cops and firemen were friends of the family. I'd
gone on ride-alongs and always liked cops. I just like the guys
they are _ they're very can-do, and I respond to that sort of
attitude, I like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York cops are huge fans of the show,'' he adds.
``We're treated like royalty. And they really opened up _ you'd be
surprised. They really told you stories about the real way they do
their job, not the way they show everybody, and stuff that probably
could've gotten them in a lot of trouble when it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   If the cops had any reservations about the former Ricky joining
the ranks of television police officers, they kept them to
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't say much,'' Schroder says. ``I mean, they were
friendly as could be and they were big fans of mine, but they
didn't say much about, `Oh yeah, kid, you're gonna do great.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they believed that, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   The steel and concrete of Manhattan is a long way from
Schroder's home, a 500-acre Colorado ranch which he bought in 1990
after visiting the area to film ``Return to Lonesome Dove.'' He was
20, and knew nothing whatever about ranching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all new,'' he recalls. ``I fell in love with the
Southwest. It took two years to find the perfect ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never my intention to live there,'' he adds. ``It was
my intention to have it as a second home, a place to go visit and
enjoy. Then we had our first baby, and we built a house and just
never left. Before I knew it, I'd been ranching for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now on my ranch there's 400 pairs of cattle,'' the actor
says. ``A pair is a mother and a baby. We pull calves (assist in a
birth) sometimes _ I've done that. I've actually had my hand up to
my shoulder inside of a cow pulling on calves, literally putting
your feet up on her butt and trying to pull it out. I love working
the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go home every weekend,'' he adds. ``I've only missed two
weekends in seven months. I'm very proud of that.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Schroder seems to have survived child stardom better
than most, but he doesn't have similar aspirations for his
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't let my kids do it, no,'' he says thoughtfully.
``But I'm glad I did it. I mean, it's cool. It's an interesting
life. I'm just protecting them from, I guess, losing those very
special young carefree years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I lost all mine,'' he adds, ``but it was tough
to be a normal kid and have normal experiences, doing what I was
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother did the best she could to provide a normal childhood,
Schroder recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never made me be a little professional,'' he says. ``She
let me be a boy. She let me get messy and she let me get in
trouble. When Universal sent letters to the production company
about me terrorizing the tour buses on the Universal Studios back
lot, setting off the `Jaws' exhibition by myself and all these
other crazy things I did growing up on Universal's lot, she would
just ignore them or rip them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew you're supposed to have fun, you're supposed to get
in trouble.''

 Includes a color slide of rock bassist Bill Wyman. 
 By SCOTT COOPER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Bill Wyman quit the Rolling Stones seven years ago, but he's
still a Stone at heart.
 &HT;    Wyman may no longer be holding down the simple, steady bass
lines to anchor Mick Jagger's sexy singing and Keith Richards'
raunchy guitar riffs, as he did for 31 years. But he's still the
unofficial historian for a group that has plenty of history.
 &HT;    ``I think they appreciate that someone keeps a record for
posterity,'' Wyman says.
 &HT;    His collection of Stones memorabilia was a great source for his
1990 memoir, ``Stone Alone,'' but it also adorns the walls of
Wyman's three British restaurants _ which bear the name Sticky
Fingers, lifted from one of the band's greatest records.
 &HT;    The Stones have kept rolling without their founding bassist, but
they keep him involved by sending packages of tour programs,
stickers, tickets, T-shirts and even the daily newsletter,
providing an insider's look at the life of a Rolling Stone.
 &HT;    ``When you're on tour, you get your daily newsletter stuffed
under your door every morning, which tells you everything that's
going on that day, even if there's nothing going on,'' the bassist
explains. ``It tells you where you are, what you're doing, where
the good restaurants are if you want to go, the good shopping
areas, and there's the doctor's phone number if you need him.''
 &HT;    Wyman doesn't miss receiving that newsletter directly, he
hastens to add.
 &HT;    ``I hated traveling in hotels and suitcases and living in
airports and hotel rooms,'' he recalls. ``I loved the times on
stage, of course _ that's the thing you do. All the rest of that's
bulls--t that goes around that. You have to deal with that for the
other 22 hours of the day, and then you only play once every three
days, so it's even longer.
 &HT;    ``It just used to drive me nuts,'' the bassist adds. ``But then
you couldn't go out, because people knew you were in town and the
hotel was surrounded and all that. So you ended up in the room all
the time. If you were lucky, you might go to a restaurant very late
on.''
 &HT;    This de-facto incarceration was only one of the restrictions
that came with membership in one of the biggest rock 'n' roll bands
ever. Wyman was equally frustrated by the fact that almost all of
the band's songs were written by Jagger and Richards.
 &HT;    ``You did an album every 18 months,'' Wyman says. ``You had two
writers who wrote bloody good songs for the band over the years.
You had nine or 10 songs to record for the album, and 30 songs
ready when you arrived at the studio. So there was no room for
anybody else to write, really.''
 &HT;    Even though he respects their songwriting talents, Wyman felt
that the Jagger-Richards songs eventually began to lose their
individuality.
 &HT;    ``Track after track tended to start the same as the tracks on
the last album,'' he says. ``There was nothing fresh coming through
for me.''
 &HT;    The only original Stone to leave the band before Wyman was
founder and multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, who quit shortly
before his drug-related death in 1969.
 &HT;    ``If Brian hadn't died,'' Wyman says, ``I think the band would
have probably broken up in the '70s. Brian was very susceptible to
experimenting with substances, and Keith's the same. So you
wouldn't have ended up carrying one junkie _ you'd be carrying two,
and it wouldn't have worked.''
 &HT;    Jones' replacement, guitarist Mick Taylor, left the band in 1975
after experiencing frustrations similar to Wyman's. In stepped
guitarist Ron Wood, whom Wyman also credits as the current group's
peacemaker, a ``catalyst'' responsible for keeping the harmony
among a group of strong personalities who aren't averse to
squabbles, major and minor.
 &HT;    His own departure, Wyman says, was primarily a result of his
``horrendous'' personal life during the late 1980s. After leaving
the band he remarried, and he and his wife are now raising three
girls.
 &HT;    ``We've got a lovely family now,'' the musician says. ``It's
just great to be around them.''
 &HT;    When Wyman quit the Stones in 1991, he adds, they didn't believe
him.
 &HT;    ``They left the door open for me right up until four months
before they started working in '94,'' he recalls. ``Then Mick and
Charlie (Watts, the band's drummer) came around and spent the
evening with me. I said, `But I left two years ago, I really did. I
did leave.'
 &HT;    ``But when I make decisions, they're decisions.''
 &HT;    In spite of their famous internal struggles, Wyman adds, the
Stones remain tight.
 &HT;    ``We're great mates and we see each other a lot, even in the
present day,'' he says. ``When Charlie's in town he comes around
for dinner. And I go to see them and stay with them over the
weekend. We're still great friends. It's not sour grapes _ it just
doesn't really interest me any more.''
 &HT;    What does interest Wyman varies wildly _ television
documentaries, blues history, archeology, astrology, photography,
art and his family among them. This marks a big difference between
him and the other Stones, he says.
 &HT;    ``I think the problem is, knowing them quite well, there's very
little else they like to do,'' Wyman says. ``Some of them have got
one other interest: Ron is into art. He has his exhibitions and
he's good at it. Mick's been trying on and off over the years to be
involved in movies, either as an actor or a producer or whatever.
That's his other interest _ apart from girls. And Charlie's into
jazz. He has a little jazz band that he plays with when the Stones
aren't working _ that's his hobby.
 &HT;    ``But that's about it,'' he concludes. ``I don't think Keith's
got anything else that's as interesting for him. He plays with
other people a bit, but it's music again.''
 &HT;    Wyman may have left the Stones, but he defends the band against
its detractors, many of whom claim that Jagger and Richards are
simply too old to live up to their own past.
 &HT;    ``Rock 'n' roll hasn't been going long enough for there to be
elder statesmen until now,'' he says. ``It's not like jazz, which
was going from the turn of the century. You had Louis Armstrong and
all those people playing when they were ancient, because the music
let them grow up and get old in it.
 &HT;    ``But this is the first time in rock 'n' roll that people have
got to the 50s and 60s,'' he says. ``There was never an opportunity
for people to grow old within that music before, because it didn't
exist before 1953 or 1954.
 &HT;    ``I don't really think of it as a young person's music,'' the
bassist says. ``The only thing that relates it to young people is
the energy that a lot of young performers put into it and make it
really stand out, which maybe we don't achieve quite as well as we
did when we were younger.''
 &HT;    So instead of testing his own theory of youth, Wyman has opted
to follow Armstrong's example. He recently released a CD of jazz
and blues titled ``Anyway the Wind Blows,'' featuring cameos from
Eric Clapton, Peter Frampton and even Mick Taylor.

 Includes a color slide of Christian Bale with Emily Watson in a
scene from ``Metroland.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Christian Bale won his latest role by a hair. Or, rather, by his
lack of same.
 &HT;    Really.
 &HT;    In Philip Saville's drama ``Metroland,'' opening across the
country through April and May, the 27-year-old Bale plays one
character at three ages _ 18, 23 and 31.
 &HT;    ``A week before filming started, Philip Saville called and said,
`Christian, do you have a hairy chest?''' says the soft-spoken
Bale, best known for his debut role as a British boy in a Japanese
prison camp in ``Empire of the Sun'' (1987). ``I said, `No,' and
Philip said, `Wonderful, would you like to play all three roles?''
 &HT;    Bale laughs.
 &HT;    ``I didn't know what the connection was, and I still don't,'' he
says. ``I just liked the challenge of playing three versions of the
same character.''
 &HT;    Based on Julian Barnes' 1980 novel, ``Metroland'' centers on
pals Chris (Bale) and Toni (Lee Ross), growing up in the late 1960s
in a suburban section of London called Metroland. The two start out
seeking adventure, but Chris ends up marrying, moving back to
Metroland and fathering a child, while Toni lives an exciting life,
crisscrossing the globe.
 &HT;    When Toni returns for a visit, it prompts Chris to wonder
whether or not he's truly happy.
 &HT;    ``It's a character study about two friends, their idealism and
black-and-white viewpoints of life,'' Bale says. ``I found it quite
nice that the younger Chris is forthright and believes he knows
exactly what he's about and then, by 30, life has taught him there
are a lot more answers to every question than he originally
thought.
 &HT;    ``The older he gets, the less he knows himself,'' the actor
says. ``Situations and perspectives change, but why? Did you
compromise? Did you lose your passion and will?
 &HT;    ``And if you answer that, how do you deal with your answers? Is
it all right to feel content being a 32-year-old, married father
who may not have fulfilled a lot of his dreams?''
 &HT;    Bale couldn't exactly relate to Chris' doubts, though.
 &HT;    ``I never had a place I wanted to escape from,'' he says during
an interview at the Manhattan office of ``Metroland's''
distributor, Lions Gate Films. ``I also don't have straitlaced
parents.
 &HT;    ``My ultimate rebellion would be to get a job at a bank,'' he
says with a laugh. ``My parents are not boring, and I've never
said, `Oh, Christ, I never want to become like them.' My mom was in
the circus for a while, and my dad was a pilot. He took a 9-to-5
job for two weeks and went mad.
 &HT;    ``He essentially does whatever he feels like doing,'' Bale says.
``At times that wasn't fun, like when we were sitting in trucks
outside a house we'd just gotten kicked out of. Other times, things
were going well and we moved to Portugal for a bit.
 &HT;    ``But I think anyone can empathize with the idea of not being
able to see the woods from the trees until somebody kicks you in
the a--.''
 &HT;    Even with critical raves _ not to mention the presence of
two-time Oscar nominee Emily Watson as Chris' wife _ ``Metroland''
faces an uphill battle at the box office. Bale agrees, but doesn't
mind.
 &HT;    ``I have to make the experience of making a film the most
important thing,'' he says. ``I don't ever want to not make a film
I'd be interested in watching because the audience for it may be
limited.''
 &HT;    Indeed, a glance at Bale's credits reveals a preponderance of
art-house films. There's ``Henry V'' (1989), ``Portrait of a Lady''
(1996), ``Velvet Goldmine'' (1998) and the upcoming ``William
Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' His occasional studio
films have included ``Swing Kids'' (1993) and ``Little Women''
(1994).
 &HT;    ``My doing studio films just hasn't happened very often,'' Bale
says. ``It's not a conscious thing.
 &HT;    ``I started out with the luxury of `Empire,''' he adds. ``There
was a huge amount of money _ we had time to do take after take
until we got it right. Now, with my smaller films, I've gotten used
to getting two or three takes and moving on. It's bang-bang-bang,
and that's good for an actor.
 &HT;    ```Metroland' was done in 26 days,'' he concludes. ``I met the
director two days before we started, and we had no rehearsal.''
 &HT;    ``Empire of the Sun,'' directed by Steven Spielberg, made Bale a
star and a teen idol, but he still grimaces at the mention of it.
 &HT;    ``It feels like a long time ago,'' says the actor, who's single
and splits his time between London and Los Angeles. ``It was a
great experience making it.
 &HT;    ``It's a good thing feeling the distance,'' he adds, ``because I
can see the good aspects again. There was a period where I sort of
resented it, because of the sudden lack of anonymity. At 14, I
didn't want people pointing at me.''
 &HT;    The actor responded to the spotlight's glare by retreating into
his private life and working primarily in smaller films that were
less likely to draw attention to himself.
 &HT;    ``I've never wanted and was never prepared for a lot of volume
about myself,'' he says. ``Having had so much volume after `Empire'
and having hated it so much, I'm sure that affected me.
 &HT;    ``It didn't touch my love of acting, but it made me question
everything else.''
 &HT;    The answer, clearly, has been to avoid teen-heartthrob roles.
His next film, ``All the Little Animals,'' casts him as a mentally
handicapped youth who befriends a reclusive animal lover (John
Hurt).
 &HT;    Next up is an even less boyishly charming role, as the title
character in ``American Psycho,'' based on Bret Easton Ellis' novel
about a brutal serial killer.
 &HT;    Hardly the stuff of teen dreams, but it briefly attracted the
high-profile attention of current idol Leonardo DiCaprio last year.
Bale and director Mary Harron, who had been committed to the
project for years, suddenly found themselves on the verge of being
ousted from what would suddenly have become a ``big'' picture.
 &HT;    ``I didn't feel like a pawn,'' Bale says. ``I always felt it was
more my film than anyone else's short of Mary. People told me to
forget about it, but I always believed I'd end up doing it, and
Mary did as well.
 &HT;    ``The whole thing, frankly, has become the most boring
subject,'' he says. ``I'm doing the film.''
 &HT;    The subject matter has also drawn considerable controversy _ the
novel, after all, was widely condemned as exploitive
quasi-pornography.
 &HT;    Bale rejects criticism from anyone who hasn't seen the film _
which, these days, includes everyone.
 &HT;    ``The film will be powerful,'' he says. ``It's a psychological
thriller about a serial killer, yet it's funny. That's an
incredible dichotomy _ it's funny and cold and ugly, often
simultaneously.
 &HT;    ``I've never experienced anything like it as an actor,'' he
says. ``I'm trying to make people laugh and hate me, really, at the
same time.''
 &HT;    Bale doesn't envy DiCaprio's cover-boy status. On the other
hand, he'd like to boost his own profile _ just a bit.
 &HT;    ``I'd love to be in a position where people don't say, `You'd be
great in this, but we've got to cast So-and-So,''' he says. ``I'd
like to be So-and-So.
 &HT;    ``I'd like to be in a position where people say, `Here's the
money. Christian Bale can be in it.' I think that's where I'm at
with independent films, and ... well, I just don't want to have any
more situations like `American Psycho.'''

NATO LOOKS HEAVENWARD FOLLOWING A SWAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 25)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The numbers came in high,'' a senior administration official
told John Harris of The Washington Post, about an estimate of NATO
troops needed to protect Kosovo. ``No one said yes, no one said no;
it was taken off the table. ... It was a complete  &UR; eye-roller &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   This is an example of an unfamiliar word that is immediately
understood. To ``roll one's eyes'' upward (the usual direction is
 &UR; heavenward &LR; ) is to visibly express astonishment, dismay or
disbelief. An  &UR; eye-roller &LR;  is the compound noun that describes a
situation or remark that causes such a reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The useful word apparently has a Pentagon origin or association.
On Dec. 1, 1987, Edwin M. Yoder Jr. reported in The Washington Post
that at a breakfast meeting Caspar Weinberger, the former defense
secretary, was ``cheerfully rattling on, and some of his listeners
are rolling their eyes upward in an unmistakable `oh, brother'
expression.'' Yoder described Weinberger's claim that record
defense budgets had nothing to do with high deficits in the Reagan
era as ``the big  &UR; eye-roller &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   The defense jargon spilled over, as it often does, into sports:
``the Bills' winning score in the fourth quarter,'' wrote Nick
Cafardo in The Boston Globe in 1996, ``was a head-shaker and an
 &UR; eye-roller &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   One synonym is  &UR; stunner &LR; , connoting ``a revelation that leaves
one thunderstruck or dumbfounded.'' Another is  &UR; mind-boggler &LR; , from
something that `` &UR; boggles &LR;  the mind'' (originally ``frighten,''
from the 16th-century  &UR; bogle &LR; 's dialect root in  &UR; goblin &LR; , but now
denoting a high degree of amazement rather than fear). However,
these synonyms do not carry the connotation of skepticism in
 &UR; eye-roller &LR; ; that new term's  &UR; heavenward &LR; -looking association
suggests ``Lord, save us from this baloney.''
</P>
<P>
   The Post's Harris, on a linguistic roll in his report of the
troop estimate that so staggered Pentagonians, went on to write:
``NATO's analysis, officials said, was not a comprehensive study.
Instead, it was an initial review that some officials called a
`SWAG' _ military parlance for a `scientific wild-ass guess.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Tribune reported in 1984 that Col. John Stewart,
testifying in a libel suit brought against CBS by Gen. William
Westmoreland, recalled admitting to his commander years before that
an estimate of enemy strength was based on ``the SWAG principle,''
and that the courtroom erupted in laughter at the explanation of
the acronym.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army's home page lists the acronym merely as  &UR; swag &LR; ,
defining it as ``a gross estimate or guess.'' This is in error;
when not printed in all capitals,  &UR; swag &LR;  is an old slang term for
``money, booty.'' Only when printed all uppercase does SWAG become
an acronym for ``Scientific Wild-Ass Guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Army phrases defined on its home page include  &UR; ankle
biters &LR; , ``people who criticize one's position but offer no
constructive alternatives'';  &UR; readahead &LR; , ``material sent to
officials to prepare them for upcoming visits'';  &UR; shotgun
coordination &LR; , ``sending duplicate packages to several offices
simultaneously to save time,'' and  &UR; wrapped around the axle &LR; ,
``lacking progress because of immersion in details or inability to
see the big picture.'' Presumably concerned about the third word in
SWAG, the Web page warns readers to ``avoid using these terms in
official correspondence, at formal briefings, when dealing with
outsiders.''
</P>
<P>
   At ease; the attributive noun phrase  &UR; wild ass &LR;  is not a
vulgarism. On the contrary, the juxtaposition of words (as
adjective and noun) can be found five times in the King James
version of the Bible, most famously reflecting well on donkeys in
Job 24:5: ``Behold, as  &UR; wild asses &LR;  in the desert, go they forth to
their work.''
</P>
<P>
   FRIARING PAN
</P>
<P>
   When competing theories come to the same result, the simplest is
preferred. That cutting of complication is encapsulated in the
metaphor of  &UR; Ockham's razor &LR; , from the parsimonious work of the
13th century's William of Ockham, described here some months ago in
this simple sentence: ``The old Franciscan friar (probably bearded;
shaving gear was hard to come by in the abbey) was figuratively
cutting out details.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your reference to a  &UR; friar &LR;  in the  &UR; abbey &LR;  was a  &UR; non
sequitur &LR; ,'' writes the Rev. Thomas J. Paprocki, chancellor of the
Archdiocese of Chicago, ``unless the Franciscan's barber happened
to be a Benedictine monk.''
</P>
<P>
   He explicates: ``Franciscan  &UR; friars &LR;  usually live in a  &UR; friary &LR; ,
defined as a monastery or place where friars live. An  &UR; abbey &LR;  is a
monastery headed by an  &UR; abbot &LR;  or a nunnery headed by an  &UR; abbess &LR; .
The Benedictines are probably the best-known example of monks and
nuns governed by abbots and abbesses, respectively. Franciscans,
however, are not governed by an abbot. St. Francis of Assisi
preferred the term  &UR; guardian &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   And this just in, as the TV newsies say, from the Conventual
Franciscan Center in Toronto: `` &UR; Monks &LR;  are members of monastic
Orders,'' writes Friar Phil Kelly, ``those who live in larger
communities and follow some sort of monastic rule. Benedictines,
Cistercians (as in Thomas Merton) or Carthusians are such groups.
 &UR; Friars &LR;  are members of the four mendicant orders founded in the
Middle Ages somewhat as a reaction to monasticism. They are the
Augustinians, the Carmelites, the Dominicans and the Franciscans.''
</P>
<P>
   Although even I know that a  &UR; novice &LR;  lives in a  &UR; novitiate &LR; , who
lives in a  &UR; priory &LR; ? (All Cartesians live  &UR; a priori &LR; .) ``Some
houses of friars, such as the Dominicans and Servites, are headed
by a  &UR; prior &LR; ,'' notes Paprocki, ``and some nuns, like the Discalced
Carmelites, are governed by a  &UR; prioress &LR; , all of whom are said to
live in a  &UR; priory &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   As Ockham would put it: Monks and nuns usually live in  &UR; abbeys &LR; 
and  &UR; friars &LR;  in  &UR; friaries &LR; , though some are in  &UR; priories &LR; . ``Your
explanation of Ockham's principle was better than what we received
in the seminary,'' notes Kelly in the spirit of charity, ``but
whining is part of my nature.''

 &HT;    Y2K keepsakes are plentiful
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some people fear that when Jan. 1, 2000, arrives, a
date-sensitive software flaw, commonly called the Y2K bug, will
cause massive computer breakdowns. Others hope the date will offer
spiritual redemption as Christ returns for the Second Coming. Still
others think New Year's Day will bring nothing more dramatic than a
hangover from the previous night's party.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how differently we view the coming of 2000, we are
united by one desire: We want millennium souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   All over the country, companies are stepping up production of
T-shirts, books, champagne flutes, stuffed animals, countdown
clocks, baseball caps, jewelry and other items that will remind us
that WE WERE THERE when all four digits of the year rolled over.
</P>
<P>
   Fancy champaign glasses seem especially popular, judging by
gifts being sold through Internet shopping sites. ``People are
ordering them for the whole family or for big parties,'' said
Patricia Heller, owner of Heller Glass in Venice, Calif. ``They
want them to say 'January 1, 2000' and their names.'' The glasses
are $44.95 a pair.
</P>
<P>
   Heller, who started her glassware business in Atlanta before
moving to California in 1993, said she spells out millennium
messages with a nontoxic acrylic paint on crystal flutes. She is
getting orders from customers such as travel agents who plan to
give pairs to customers booking big millennium trips and party
hosts who want their New Year's Eve guests to remember where they
were at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the souvenirs are tied to the Year 2000, or Y2K,
computer flaw. That's the computer software glitch that could cause
malfunctions as a result of a misreading of the date change. Some
companies are selling T-shirts or jewelry featuring bugs. Many
authors are using Y2K as a marketing angle, pushing ``doomsday''
books and survival product.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reports that stores specializing in
Christian products are seeing big increases in sales of books about
``end-time'' prophecies and Y2K calamities. The Christian
Booksellers Association reports that three of the top seven books
on the nonfiction best-seller list deal directly with Y2K
predictions.
</P>
<P>
   Other Christians believe that, rather than mark the ``end
times,'' Jan. 1 should be celebrated as the start of Christianity's
third and greatest millennium. And surely a keepsake is needed for
that. One jewelry maker is selling a ``Christianity 2000'' pendant,
minted from one ounce of fine silver and guaranteed to ``become a
family heirloom to be passed down for generations to come,''
according to the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, called Me2!, is trying to counteract the
popularity of doomsday products. On the Me2! Web site, buyers are
informed the stock is geared to people who aren't ``wringing their
hands about a global computer crisis.'' The products include: the
``Millipede,'' a stuffed bug for children; mugs; golf balls and
shot glasses with upbeat millennium messages.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the millennium gifts on the market, perhaps the most
practical is the set of ``Millennium Bug Cuff links'' for $21. Each
link features a bug clambering over a computer keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   How can you go wrong? If it turns out that Y2K causes no real
trouble, then you have a cute souvenir that doesn't have to be
displayed or take up a lot of room in a drawer. But if the computer
flaw does cause economic and social chaos, just pop off the gold
cuff links, melt them down and trade the metal for a loaf of bread.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Family of faith extends far and wide
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ There are times in life when you are helpless. It
happened to me recently when my brother, who lives in California,
underwent triple bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Like many families today, we are scattered across the country.
When my brother was told he would need this surgery _ his second
bypass _ we tried to put in motion a plan to care for him,
thousands of miles away from his family in Texas and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   After his first bypass surgery, my mother went to California,
staying a month and nearly doing herself in. This time, my sister
and I felt it would be too hard emotionally and physically for her
to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, my brother would have his own family or community that
would rally around him. He does have friends, but the care he would
need was more than even good friends could provide.
</P>
<P>
   So we put together a plan as best we could. My sister offered to
fly out the day he was released from the hospital. She would stay
two weeks and then, hopefully, they could fly back together to
Missouri _ where the rest of my family lives _ for his
recuperation.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed the wisest course, but it also meant no one would be
with him before, during or in the immediate days after his surgery.
It was incredibly painful for us, so far away, to think of him
alone at such a time. I could not imagine how lonely and
anxiety-ridden it would be for him.
</P>
<P>
   As one who is constantly supported by her community of faith, I
turned to that larger family for help. I first called the hospital
where the surgery was to be performed and asked for the chaplain's
office. The staffer I spoke to assured me, after hearing our
situation, that she would personally meet with my brother before
surgery and check on him throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   With my pastor's help, we found a church of our denomination
that was close to my brother's home. I called and asked for their
assistance. The pastor was away, but I was connected with his
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   It must have seemed an odd call to this faithful church staff
member as she listened to a harried woman from half-way across the
continent explaining her family's situation. But she listened
patiently as I asked if someone in the church would be willing to
visit my brother after his surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will see if there is someone who can go, and if there isn't,
I promise you I personally will go,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the days that followed, each of these strangers showed great
kindness and compassion to my brother and our family. The chaplain
called my mother at least twice the day of the surgery to update
her on my brother's condition. A social worker gave us the names of
home health care providers, and the pastor's assistant went to
visit my brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just come from the hospital,'' she told me on the phone.
``It was such a joy to meet your brother. There is great tenderness
in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told him who I was and that you had arranged for me to
visit him, his eyes welled up with tears. He very clearly knows how
much his family loves him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have three brothers of my own,'' she told me, ``and one of
them is in Texas. I would like to think that if he needed help,
someone would go to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' she added, ``it's kind of what it's all about,
isn't it? Each of us helping the other?''
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't be there for my brother. I couldn't call for the
nurse or bring him ice chips or smooth his blanket. And I couldn't
be there to hold his hand and pray with him.
</P>
<P>
   But another could be _ and was.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Legislative symbol fight is for the birds
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ It is a political axiom that the smaller
the stakes, the bigger the fight. Legislators will fall asleep on
their ``yea'' buttons for millions of dollars in state programs but
argue furiously about license plates, the names of roadways or what
to include in the state's collection of official flora and fauna.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has an official state soil _ myakka fine sand, duh! _
and we have an official state reptile. We have an official
beverage, official butterfly, official fish, official flower,
official wild flower, official gem, official litter-control symbol,
official shell, official stone, official tree and official water
mammals, freshwater and saltwater.
</P>
<P>
   The last state-symbol fight was two years ago when
African-American House members objected to the official state song,
``Suwannee River.''
</P>
<P>
   They had a point. Lines like ``still longing for de old
plantation'' give off the faint aroma of burnt cork. But lacking
any good alternative song to this bit of tired minstrelsy, their
objections went nowhere. And in these clean-living times, I suppose
substituting ``Margaritaville'' would have been politically
incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Legislature debates a less offensive state
symbol, the state bird.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's state bird is the mockingbird. As insistent as a
lobbyist, as noisy as a journalist, as aggressive as a first-term
representative with bigger ambitions _ these are birds legislators
understand.
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing Floridalike about them. Mockingbirds are
found anywhere in the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Most people can't name their state bird. Most people assume the
flamingo is the state bird. Flamingos are printed on all the
lottery tickets, and no Floridian I know has ever put a plastic
mockingbird in his front yard.
</P>
<P>
   But the flamingo is not an environmentally correct choice. It is
an introduced species, brought here from somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   To my mind, this makes flamingos even more representative of
Florida, The Land of People Who Came Here from Somewhere Else.
</P>
<P>
   A fitting symbol of a transplanted people, however, is not the
stuff of a stately indigenous official symbol. Environmental groups
are pushing instead to make the scrub jay Florida's state bird.
</P>
<P>
   One would think this would not be a big deal. The scrub jay is
the only bird found solely in Florida. The only local candidate
around.
</P>
<P>
   They also are threatened. There are only about 11,000 left.
Scrub jays, unsurprisingly enough, live in scrubs, a habitat that
is giving way to houses, golf courses, roads, 7-Elevens and
whatnot. Some development interests take offense that a bird they
are crowding out of existence might become the state bird.
Property-rights activists smell an attempt to Get in the Way of
Progress.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association's lobbyist, the aptly named
Marion Hammer, blasted the idea. She characterized the bird as
``lazy'' with ``a welfare mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They eat the eggs of other birds,'' she huffed. ``That's
criminal conduct, that's robbery and murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Harsh stuff. Supporters countered that mockingbirds are no gems
among birdkind, either. They're mean and will go after squirrels
and cats.
</P>
<P>
   When legislators and lobbyists debate the relative morality of
wildlife species, you know things are getting strange in the state
capital.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, the right-wing House has opted for the mockingbird
while the moderate Senate is looking favorably on the scrub jay.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe as a compromise the Legislature will make the scrub
mockingbird the state bird and embark on an ambitious and expensive
cross-breeding program to produce a few. They would be indigenous
to the House speaker's district.
</P>
<P>
   I'm for making everyone happy. They could declare the flamingo
the official state lawn-ornament bird and the scrub jay, the
temporary official state bird. After we develop the jays out of
existence, the mockingbird could resume its title. Nobody wants an
official dead bird.
</P>
<P>
   With the matter thus disposed of, legislators could move to more
vital matters. Like naming an official state insect. I nominate the
palmetto bug. I expect the tourism industry already is mobilizing a
counter-campaign.

QUALITY ASIDE, COST OF MARINER BALLPARK EMBARRASSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Sometime during the Behring reign of error, but before
the Seahawks announced the ill-fated attempt to move to Los
Angeles, a club official confided in me the estimated cost to fix
up the Kingdome to new NFL standards.
</P>
<P>
   He was searching for clues as to how the remodel cost would play
publicly. I told him his figure would get him and most of his
colleagues shot at sunrise. No blindfold. No cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   The cost: $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, when it comes to stadiums, $120 million is
just a cost overrun. Offer to fix an old stadium for $120 million,
and insiders would say don't bother, because that pittance will buy
fresh paint, new carpet and two speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Facilities District announced that the price tag on
the Mariners' new park had risen to $517 million, which struck me
two ways:
</P>
<P>
   -- It was announced on opening night, which challenges the
Mariners' record for atrocious timing _ November 1997, when the
club said Randy Johnson's contract wouldn't be extended while Ken
Griffey Jr. was announced as the winner of the American League MVP
award.
</P>
<P>
   -- Is anybody embarrassed by this figure?
</P>
<P>
   Public expressions of dismay seem mild. Oh, the state's teachers
plan to gather near the ballpark April 22 to demonstrate on behalf
of higher salaries, figuring the stadium is a classic case of
society's misplaced priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that, the apparent shrug over costs that top the 1989
figure on Toronto's SkyDome (which also included a hotel and a Hard
Rock Cafe) to make it North America's most expensive jock joint,
indicates that the public is either inured to sticker shock or so
jaded it doesn't care.
</P>
<P>
   But some people are paid to care. So I asked one of them: Are
you embarrassed?
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is being cavalier about this,'' said Ken Johnsen, the
PFD's executive director. ``No one is saying, `Oh, that's just what
it costs.' Everyone has been cost-conscious on this project. The
contractors and managers of this project have a really good track
record of coming in at or under budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew. That's good to know. Imagine if they had been reckless or
foolish.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's two categories to the answer,'' Johnsen said. ``One is
that some of the increases were due to conscious decisions that are
improvements for fans. The other is: Do we wish we could have
understood some of the costs better going in? Yeah, sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``But did anyone here really screw up? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the obvious delays created by this winter's wretched
weather, Johnsen cited two major underestimations: the removal of
contaminated soil from the site, and the concrete work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't fully comprehend,'' he said, ``the complexity of
concrete work in the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   He also cited at least four recent improvements added to the
bill by the Mariner owners, who are on the hook for costs beyond
the $417 million in tax money.
</P>
<P>
   The scoreboard was enlarged, the broadcast communications system
was upgraded, concessions areas were increased and the parking
garage expanded.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnsen allowed as to how each of those items would also
produce more revenue for the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true, but is it a cost overrun if it brings in more
revenue?'' he said. ``In the long run, these things make the asset
more valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   By far the biggest problem with the stadium was change orders,
the construction term for alterations requested by owners after
plans were drawn up and bid upon or, in some cases, work was
completed.
</P>
<P>
   One example is the clubhouse whirlpool. The Mariners wanted the
large, walk-in kind sunk into the floor. Problem was, the concrete
was already poured. Tons had to be jackhammered out to accommodate
the pool, plumbing and wiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more change orders here than with any project I've
ever been involved with,'' Johnsen said. ``Everyone wishes that the
drawings were further along, but once you make the decision to go,
you go.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``go'' decision is what made this park so expensive. The 29
months from the March 1997, groundbreaking to the July 15 opener is
the shortest construction time among any of the new generation of
parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about 2000, but the Mariners were interested in
keeping the 1999 schedule,'' Johnsen said. ``They knew of the
potential for cost overruns, but there was not a doubt in their
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnsen echoed what many other previewers have said about the
park.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take anyone through this who knows anything about
construction, I'm sure they would say this is a quality project,''
he said. ``I'd be really disappointed if the park was built without
the features and quality that will make this the best in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The yard, to most baseball followers, indeed will be grand. To
taxpayers and some citizens, whatever the explanations and
rationalizations, the place will be a civic indulgence beyond the
imagination of anyone with a sense of shame.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mariners, it's Safeco Field. For me, from here on, it's
the Guilty Pleasure.

 &HT;    Who failed Johnny? (Part One)
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The following is a story initially written three years ago. It
will move in two parts, the second moving Tuesday, April 20.
</P>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``Why are you wasting my son's time with all
those essays? What does writing have to do with English anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   It's parent-teacher conference night. This is the first time
I've ever seen Johnny's mother around the schoolhouse and she
explains, not too happily, that she wouldn't be having to ``bother
with it'' now if I hadn't failed her son. ``I'm too busy to waste
my time running to school,'' is her terse observation.
</P>
<P>
   I thank her for coming and wonder what's taken her so long ...
what she has to do that is more important than her son's education
and why she hasn't responded to the letters I've mailed home
letting her know that Johnny was liable to fail if he didn't make
an effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny's father thinks what's going on in this classroom is a
waste of time and money, all of these essays and stuff. When we
were in school, we learned real English, not writing.''
</P>
<P>
   As odd as this argument might sound, I've heard it all before.
But my problem is not with the grammar vs. reading/writing methods
of teaching high school English, it's with the ``You failed my
son.''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody failed her son, that's for sure. But who?
</P>
<P>
   Is Johnny's failure my fault?
</P>
<P>
   I don't think so, but it never hurts a teacher to re-evaluate
her methods.
</P>
<P>
   What do I do for Johnny? With Johnny? To Johnny? And, whatever
am I going to do about Johnny?
</P>
<P>
   There are 15 students in Johnny's 4th period class. Plenty of
time for individual instruction. We have time to talk about
writing, to study the format for a 3-point, 5-paragraph essay, and
from time to time, as a class, to create one together, writing it
on the board, and arguing (literally) points of grammar and usage
as we go. Lively student-vs.-student debates are always a
first-class learning device.
</P>
<P>
   What else have I done for Johnny?
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, I read aloud to the class; sometimes from the
classics and frequently from a classmate's latest creation. More
often, the students ask to do the reading themselves _ Johnny
included. There's no question about it; Johnny can read.
</P>
<P>
   So why is Johnny failing?
</P>
<P>
   All of our writing is accomplished in the classroom, so there's
no need for Johnny to burn the midnight oil in order to come up
with ``just five more sentences'' or a concluding paragraph. The
whole idea is to do it now and here, where budding writers can yell
for help when they suddenly find themselves fresh out of ideas or
drawing a blank on transitions. ``That's why I'm here,'' I remind
them as I encourage them to ask me, or better yet, ask a classmate
for advice; that way two people are learning instead of only one.
Throughout the school year we write everything from letters to the
state Board of Education complaining of the limitations inherent in
the state proficiency program, to one-liners for skits. We compare
and contrast, we describe, inform, and enter magazine and newspaper
contests. No form of writing is overlooked. If they can think it
up, we write it.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Johnny's class was in the mood to cop a Poe attitude
and create a mystery. A couple of independent spirits nixed the
sleuthing and opted for metaphor-heavy Hemingway-style adventures.
That's OK too.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnny's not having any.
</P>
<P>
   Our grading system is pretty straightforward. The students write
and I correct and comment on their efforts. Papers are returned
with a grade and a circled ``rewrite by'' date in the upper left
corner. Rewrites are unlimited
</P>
<P>
   which means any and every student has infinite opportunity to
earn the 10/10, a perfect score, if he or she is willing to work at
it.
</P>
<P>
   I explain to Johnny's mom that her son comes to class daily with
neither supplies nor intent and that no amount of encouragement
seems to divert him from his self-destructive, nonparticipatory
stance. ``Just don't wanna' do it,'' he admits with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny is not a discipline problem. He is respectful, even when
he is refusing to raise a ballpoint to the attack position. I check
with Johnny's other teachers and sure enough, he's consistent in
his ``Right not to work'' policy. Same song, different verse.
</P>
<P>
   Now what?
</P>
<P>
   Has society and the system failed Johnny?
</P>
<P>
   ``Back-to-Basics!'' ``The 3 Rs Rock!'' The slogans are
everywhere. Parents, politicians, and otherwise interested folks
are urging a return to old-time education. I can't argue with them;
it's the way I learned. But as today's
</P>
<P>
   teachers look around their classrooms they see Johnnys who can't
sleep nights because their parents' constant fighting and yelling
keeps them awake; Susies, whose moms have a succession of
frequently abusive live-ins; and best friends whose parents are
selling dope to the neighborhood kids.
</P>
<P>
   So, how do we convince Johnny and Susie that it's imperative to
memorize the multiplication tables? They're focused on surviving.
</P>
<P>
   Have school systems, in their dedication to students' rights,
gone overboard in the move to ``socialize'' their teen-agers? Is
the emphasis on sharing and celebrating differences leaving
schoolwork and study in the lurch? And what does ``facilitating''
mean, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   In a society where newborns are being tossed into trashbins and
success is measured by acquisition, how do we make Johnny believe
us when we tell him he is important? Something more than a cipher
in a computer?
</P>
<P>
   Would it be surprising to learn that Johnny has become an
unwitting victim of society's rampant pessimism about everything
from job security to political leaders? What can we give Johnny to
believe in. What can we offer him as a long-term reward in return
for his academic labors?
</P>
<P>
   Schools can and do provide the skills Johnny will need for
lifelong learning. Critical thinking and problem solving are two of
them.
</P>
<P>
   One of the goals of education is to train young minds to think _
not (ITAL) what (END ITAL) to think, mind you, but simply (ITAL)
how (END ITAL) to think. To be able to apply already learned
information to new situations and ideas _ to think critically and
to solve problems.
</P>
<P>
   It has never been education's belief that in 12 short years it
might provide a student with all the answers _ with everything he
or she would ever need to know. We're far more realistic than that.
Our aim is to prepare them for post secondary education _ whether
it be academic, technical, or life, by offering a firm foundation
in the basics.
</P>
<P>
   In a commentary on the times, schools now find themselves in the
business of teaching conflict resolution, so that Johnny and Susie
can learn to solve disagreements without resorting to mortal combat
or packing a ``Saturday night special'' in their lunchboxes.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Johnny? If it's not the teacher, the system, or
society causing Johnny to fail, then what is it?
</P>
<P>
   Have Johnny's parents failed Johnny?
</P>
<P>
   By today's standards, my Johnny is a lucky boy. He has two
parents, two sisters, and one brother, and they have always lived
together _ an uninterrupted biological family _ which eliminates
the single-parent rationale.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so where's the problem?
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny works hard on the farm,'' his mother remarks by way of
chalking up one on the plus side of her son's slate. ``He's a good
boy and he helps his father.'' I nod in agreement; Johnny is a good
boy. I ask Mom if the family encourages Johnny to finish his
homework before he flops in front of the television for the
evening. Mom says Johnny never has any homework. I tell Mom that
Johnny's blowing smoke and suggest she get in touch with his other
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Mom shrugs. Says she does her best but she works long hours.
</P>
<P>
   I ask Mom who Johnny's friends are. Are they achievers or
goof-offs? She's not sure.
</P>
<P>
   I mention peer pressure and the positive effects it can have on
kids like Johnny. I explain how on more than one occasion I've seen
persistent underachievers turned into acceptable scholars when they
begin ``hanging'' with a different crowd or get all goofy in love
with an honor student.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, peer pressure is a most effective means of turning a
teen around because he (or she) will do what it takes to
``belong,'' frequently withoutquestioning the wisdom of following
the crowd. Adolescence does not appear to be a time when objective
decision making is emphasized. Glands so frequently seem to get in
the way.
</P>
<P>
   Well, what about Johnny?
</P>
<P>
   Has Johnny failed Johnny?
</P>
<P>
   Of course he has. But why?
</P>
<P>
   There have been enough studies conducted on why Johnny and Susie
are failing, to fill warehouses. Most all of them, I'm sure, have
been carefully researched and painstakingly evaluated, but what
about results? What do we do with all of these facts and figures?
Where does education go from here?
</P>
<P>
   Simple; we keep trying. Educators know there's no roadmap to an
educational Utopia, no universal remedy to education's ills, but
that doesn't mean we're going to call in the scouts and abandon the
exploration. Johnny deserves better than that.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny deserves an education.

 &HT;    Elementary school students join National TV-Turnoff Week
 &HT;    By Keith Still
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For most kids, a week without television would be
unthinkable. Unplug the Nintendo 64, and you're talking cruel and
unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   But students at Cobb County's Davis Elementary School are out to
prove that not only can it be done, it also can be fun.
</P>
<P>
   For a week starting Thursday, kids at Davis will voluntarily
join their families and millions of others in turning off their TVs
for the fifth annual National TV-Turnoff Week. The kids and their
parents have signed pledge cards not to watch TV.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the national event want people to see how too much
TV can keep them from reading, thinking, creating and interacting
with family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the kids at Davis don't think they watch a lot of
TV, this will be the first time many of them go without it
completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time I care for TV is when I ask my mom if we can
watch `Full House,''' said third-grader Andrea Brown. ``I like that
show because it's funny and not boring. Most TV is boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's fifth-grade sister, Kristin, also will forgo her
favorite shows in the popular Friday lineup on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-grader Anne Kimball said she and her first-grade brother,
John, sometimes watch a lot of TV, but they'll turn it off this
week to spend more time with their family and play more games.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone will have an easy time with it. Kindergartners
Jared D'orazio and Krista Miller think it's going to be a long
week. And several kids think their parents or younger siblings will
probably sneak a peek at the news or ``Arthur'' while they're at
school.
</P>
<P>
   The school and PTA have a list of fun ideas to help the kids and
their families get through those tempting moments. Suggestions
range from making animals out of pipe cleaners or learning sign
language to taking a family walk or going to the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not enough, kids can consult veterans Devin Arch and
Will Spence. Spence took part in last year's TV-Turnoff and found
that it really wasn't that hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think television is really good for you,'' said
Spence, a fifth-grader. ``You see the characters the way they want
you to see them. It's not like in a book, where you can imagine
things.''
</P>
<P>
   For second-grader Arch, a week without TV is nothing. Every
year, her family unplugs the television, VCR and video games for
the entire month of August.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fine with me,'' Arch said. ``I forget about the TV. My
(16-year-old) brother doesn't like it very much though.''

 &HT;    NATO bombings continue
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces
continued to pound military targets in Belgrade, Yugoslavia's
capital city, and in the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro last week.
Hundreds of thousands of refugees from Kosovo poured into
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   More than a half-million people have fled or been driven from
Kosovo since March. Kosovo is a province in Yugoslavia that wants
to be independent. Kosovar Albanians, who are Muslim, have been
fighting with the Christian Serbs, who run Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials are investigating the accidental bombing of
Kosovo refugees fleeing the country. Serb officials say the NATO
air attack killed 75 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Schools ban little monsters
</P>
<P>
   Be careful if you hang out with Pikachu or Jigglypuff _ they
might get you into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Principals around the country are banning students from trading
their Pokemon cards at school. Millions of the cards based on the
Japanese cartoon and video game have been sold in the United States
since January.
</P>
<P>
   The principal at Colonial Elementary School near New York City
has banned trading between pupils ``because some of our younger
kids were getting suckered out of their more valuable cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Wolski, a second-grader at the school, doesn't bring his
cards to school anymore. ``The teachers don't like it and the
principal said he'd better not catch us trading.'' Besides, he
said, ``Somebody was stealing them!''
</P>
<P>
   Planet system found
</P>
<P>
   Look! Up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane _ no it's a new
solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists discovered for the first time three large planets
spinning around a star. The star, similar to our sun, is 44
light-years away. Lone planets circling a star have been spotted
before, but this is the first time multiple ones have been found.
</P>
<P>
   This discovery tells us that many of the galaxy's stars are
likely to have planets too, said Debra Fischer of San Francisco
State University. ``It implies that planets can form more easily
than we ever imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   The star the planets circle, Upsilon Andromedae, is usually
visible with the naked eye, though it is currently behind our own
sun and will not be seen until June.
</P>
<P>
   Bye-bye Wohlers
</P>
<P>
   The Braves traded troubled relief pitcher Mark Wohlers to the
Cincinnati Reds on Friday. The Braves received relief pitcher John
Hudek in return.
</P>
<P>
   In nine seasons with the Braves, Wohlers had 31 wins, 22 losses
and 112 saves. Wohlers, 29, refused a minor-league assignment last
week, and had to be traded or released. He's had problems
controlling the ball since last season.
</P>
<P>
   Hudek, 32, has a 10 wins and 14 losses during his career with
Houston, the New York Mets and Cincinnati.

 &HT;    Hummer likable even if you don't need one
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It has rubber floor mats, no air bags, no 5-mph
bumpers and a sticker price of $97,100. I've never felt safer in
any vehicle in my life. What is it? It's a Hummer, of course.
</P>
<P>
   When offered the opportunity to test drive the Hummer, I
halfheartedly accepted. When I would see a Hummer being driven on
the street, I would scowl, ``Disgusting display of excess.'' And,
yes, a Hummer probably is more vehicle than anyone really needs.
</P>
<P>
   But after a week with my competition yellow civilian version of
the same vehicle that our troops are using around the world, I came
away a fan.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of AM General Corp. and its High Mobility
Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle _ Hummer to civilians _ can be traced
to Willys-Overland Co. and its world-famous Jeep. It introduced
America to the small, four-wheel-drive utility truck.
</P>
<P>
   With some 350,000 vehicles produced during the 1940s in support
of the war effort, the jeep became a symbol of the U.S. Army. Soon,
peacetime commercial applications of the vehicle became popular,
and America embraced off-road driving in the Jeeps of today, such
as the Grand Cherokee and Wrangler.
</P>
<P>
   Look closely at your mail carrier's vehicle, and you can see a
similarity to the Hummer. AM General builds those little vehicles
mail carriers use.
</P>
<P>
   So how did the World War II jeep evolve into the Hummer?
</P>
<P>
   As technology changed, the Army's requirement for a new
generation of off-road, 4x4 vehicles became evident. In 1979, as a
subsidiary of American Motors Corp., AM General began preliminary
design work on the M998 series HMMWV. AMC also was the parent
company of Jeep, which later was purchased by Chrysler Corp., which
in turn has become DaimlerChrysler. AM General has remained
independent.
</P>
<P>
   The Army awarded AM General a prototype contract in 1981 that
led to the initial production for HMMWVs in 1985. Since then, more
than 170,000 HMMWVs have been produced for the U.S. armed forces
and foreign armies. The HMMWV proved prominent in the U.S. military
action in Panama and Operation Desert Storm. There are HMMWVs in
areas adjacent to Kosovo right now.
</P>
<P>
   AM General's introduction of a civilian Hummer in 1991 enabled
the general public to experience the off-road performance of a
military-based vehicle. The civilian Hummer has retained the same
drivetrain (a General Motors V-8, 6.5-liter 195-horsepower diesel
hooked to a GM four-speed automatic), full frame, double-wishbone
chassis with coil springs and basic body construction as the
combat-proven military version.
</P>
<P>
   Although a number of changes have been incorporated to produce a
more commercial vehicle (cruise control, electric windows, heated
front window, carpeted console that is large enough to hold three
full-size pizzas, adjustable armrests, CD/cassette stereo, rear
window defogger and, of course, cup holders), the design integrity
and superior off-road capability have been maintained.
</P>
<P>
   About as far off-road as I got was Atlanta's freeways, but you
never know when that $2,500 optional front bumper winch might come
in handy during rush hour, not to mention the central tire
inflation system that allows you to increase and decrease air
pressure in the Goodyear RunFlat tires without leaving the driver's
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, with a ground clearance of 16 inches and the ability
to climb a 60 percent grade, the Hummer will just about allow you
to make your own road.

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It has rubber floor mats, no air bags, no 5-mph
bumpers and a sticker price of $97,100. I've never felt safer in
any vehicle in my life. What is it? It's a Hummer, of course.
</P>
<P>
   When offered the opportunity to test drive the Hummer, I
halfheartedly accepted. When I would see a Hummer being driven on
the street, I would scowl, ``Disgusting display of excess.'' And,
yes, a Hummer probably is more vehicle than anyone really needs.
</P>
<P>
   But after a week with my competition yellow civilian version of
the same vehicle that our troops are using around the world, I came
away a fan.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of AM General Corp. and its High Mobility
Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle _ Hummer to civilians _ can be traced
to Willys-Overland Co. and its world-famous Jeep. It introduced
America to the small, four-wheel-drive utility truck.
</P>
<P>
   With some 350,000 vehicles produced during the 1940s in support
of the war effort, the jeep became a symbol of the U.S. Army. Soon,
peacetime commercial applications of the vehicle became popular,
and America embraced off-road driving in the Jeeps of today, such
as the Grand Cherokee and Wrangler.
</P>
<P>
   Look closely at your mail carrier's vehicle, and you can see a
similarity to the Hummer. AM General builds those little vehicles
mail carriers use.
</P>
<P>
   So how did the World War II jeep evolve into the Hummer?
</P>
<P>
   As technology changed, the Army's requirement for a new
generation of off-road, 4x4 vehicles became evident. In 1979, as a
subsidiary of American Motors Corp., AM General began preliminary
design work on the M998 series HMMWV. AMC also was the parent
company of Jeep, which later was purchased by Chrysler Corp., which
in turn has become DaimlerChrysler. AM General has remained
independent.
</P>
<P>
   The Army awarded AM General a prototype contract in 1981 that
led to the initial production for HMMWVs in 1985. Since then, more
than 170,000 HMMWVs have been produced for the U.S. armed forces
and foreign armies. The HMMWV proved prominent in the U.S. military
action in Panama and Operation Desert Storm. There are HMMWVs in
areas adjacent to Kosovo right now.
</P>
<P>
   AM General's introduction of a civilian Hummer in 1991 enabled
the general public to experience the off-road performance of a
military-based vehicle. The civilian Hummer has retained the same
drivetrain (a General Motors V-8, 6.5-liter 195-horsepower diesel
hooked to a GM four-speed automatic), full frame, double-wishbone
chassis with coil springs and basic body construction as the
combat-proven military version.
</P>
<P>
   Although a number of changes have been incorporated to produce a
more commercial vehicle (cruise control, electric windows, heated
front window, carpeted console that is large enough to hold three
full-size pizzas, adjustable armrests, CD/cassette stereo, rear
window defogger and, of course, cup holders), the design integrity
and superior off-road capability have been maintained.
</P>
<P>
   About as far off-road as I got was Atlanta's freeways, but you
never know when that $2,500 optional front bumper winch might come
in handy during rush hour, not to mention the central tire
inflation system that allows you to increase and decrease air
pressure in the Goodyear RunFlat tires without leaving the driver's
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, with a ground clearance of 16 inches and the ability
to climb a 60 percent grade, the Hummer will just about allow you
to make your own road.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm going to France soon and was wondering how much wine I
could bring back. I'd like to buy a bottle or two from each region
I visit. When I return, I would like to have a wine-tasting party.
_Toni K.
</P>
<P>
   A: You are 21, I assume ... and the wine is for your own use and
not commercial purposes. Every state has its own laws regarding the
importation of alcoholic beverages. When there is a conflict
between state and federal laws, the stricter is enforced by the
U.S. Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If one's VCR is not compliant with Y2K, is it true you can
set the year to 1972 because the days and dates are the same as
year 2000? _Bill C.
</P>
<P>
   A: Should work. These years have the same calendar, including a
29-day February. Calendar refresher: Leap years are those divisible
by four except _ in the Gregorian Calendar's efforts to remain
precise _ years ending in ``00'' that are not divisible by 400. So
1600 and 2000 are leap years; 1800, 1900 and 2100 are not.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In her book, ``Hill Country,'' Janice Woods Windle said that
in 1918 your newspaper's name was the Austin Statesman. If that is
true, when and why was the ``American'' added? _ Jeanne Hewitt
</P>
<P>
   A: The Austin Statesman was the evening paper; the Austin
American, the morning. The two merged in 1924 and combined for
weekend editions, but it wasn't until November 1973 that
subscribers received ``The Austin American-Statesman'' on a daily
basis.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have the question of all questions. My best friend and I
are scuba divers intrigued by dangerous marine life. We are looking
for a professional dive crew to take us out into the Pacific in an
anti-shark cage to dive in LARGE shark-infested waters. Any way?
_Hunter C. Westbrook
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh ye of little faith. Contact Diversion Dive Travel and
Training, P.O. Box 7026, Cairns 4870, Australia, to sign up for
six- or nine-day excursions departing Adelaide. The trips cruise
the breeding grounds for sea lions and fur seals _ both look
appetizing to the great white shark. Meals, scuba tanks, weights
and belts are provided, but you must bring _ among other things _ a
warm, full-length wet suit, ``farmer john pants,'' regulator, mask
and hard-sole dive boots. Price? $3,125 plus air fare. Q: I do not
understand why stamp rolls are upside down. Who is responsible and
where do I voice my opinion?
</P>
<P>
   _A.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: Direct your ire to Stamp Management, U.S. Postal Service, 475
L'Enfant Plaza SW, Washington, D.C. 20260. Stamp coils are made for
the convenience of high-speed affixing machines, not Joe Consumer.
According to Don Smeraldi of Stamp Management, thousands of these
machines exist. He suggests you remove the stamps from the inside
of the coil.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After having a baby shower I noticed punch cup rings on my
antique, marble-top table. Mild soap and water didn't remove them.
I tried a small amount of toothpaste and a soft cloth _ no luck.
Help!!! The punch had fresh lemon and pineapple juice. The table is
a family heirloom. _Dolores D.
</P>
<P>
   A: The acid in the punch probably caused the rings. Christy
Stasswender of Southwest Marble &AMP; Granite Works says a poultice may
remove them. If not, you need a professional repolishing. Here's
Stasswender's poultice prescription. Dampen the area first. Mix
powdered chalk or talc with a 12-percent hydrogen peroxide solution
(the consistency of peanut butter). After applying it thickly (
1/4- to 1/2-inch thick) cover with plastic and allow to dry (24 to
48 hours). Remove, rinse with distilled water and buff with a
clean, dry cloth. Repeat if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently filed bankruptcy. I'm trying to find a credit card
for which you send money that is put in savings to establish
credit. Some cards don't accept someone with a bankruptcy; others
want your checking account number. Can you help? _B.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: A secured credit card requires a cash deposit as collateral.
In most cases, this deposit earns interest. Some banks issuing
secured credit cards report your status to a credit bureau.
Accounts in good standing may be eligible for an unsecured credit
line in several months. To re-establish credit, do not apply for
cards for which you will not qualify, says Nancy Bolitho, education
coordinator for Consumer Credit Counseling Service. An unsuccessful
inquiry (read: rejection) may show up on a credit report.Visit
www.bankcard.com for a list. Before you sign up for any credit
card, check the requirements, as this is a changing industry. Q: We
have been reading books by Louis Sachar. We wanted to know if he
goes to schools and talks to kids. How can we get in touch with
Louis Sachar? _Mrs. Horak's Third Grade Class
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, the winner of the Newbery Award and the National Book
Award for young people's literature for ``Holes'' does speak to
students. Unfortunately his schedule is full for this school year.
To contact him about speaking next year (there is a fee) write to:
Jeanne McDermott, Farrar Straus &AMP; Giroux, Inc., 19 Union Square
West, New York 10003.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am racking my brains trying to come up with a sentence of
the bluebonnet song. I learned it in elementary school:
``Bluebonnets, bluebonnets, with your coat so blue; Your white eyes
are shining through the silvery dew. ... and that you'll return
again to Texas in the spring.'' Could you find the missing words?
None of my Texas friends knows it! _Camille Yale
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, you missed Dianne Schoss, a teacher at Will Davis
Elementary School. The missing line is, ``I know you're a dolly
offered for the rain.'' Makes sense if you know the inspiration
behind the song, Tomie De Paola's book ``The Legend of the
Bluebonnet.'' Do not confuse this with the state flower song,
adopted by the Legislature in 1933, ``Bluebonnets,'' written by
Julia D. Booth and Lora C. Crockett. Its chorus ends, ``Texas chose
you for her flower, And we love you best, Bluebonnets.'' Q: How
might I get tickets for the Emeril Live shows in New York? _T.Z.
</P>
<P>
   A: The 1999 Emeril Live (New Orleans chef Lagasse) random ticket
lottery system closed Jan. 15. Sign-up for the lottery occurs once
or twice a year. Next season's info will be posted at
www.foodtv.com and on the Emeril Live hotline (212) 997-8836.
</P>
<P>
   Upshot/Update/Uproar
</P>
<P>
   Here is a reader recommendation for a roach cocktail. Mix one
part boric acid crystals (not powder) with one part sugar and three
parts cornmeal. Place in a small lid; put under sinks and in the
garage. Apparently this will deliver even the never-say-die variety
of roach to that great roach motel in the sky. Change the mixture
twice a year. Boric acid is a poison and should never be within
reach of children or pets.

   SHARP-DRIVING _ When offered the opportunity to test drive the
Hummer, I halfheartedly accepted. When I would see a Hummer being
driven on the street, I would scowl, ``Disgusting display of
excess.'' And, yes, a Hummer probably is more vehicle than anyone
really needs. But after a week with my competition yellow civilian
version of the same vehicle that our troops are using around the

 &HT;    Net a great source for free images
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the earliest days of computing, graphics and images
weren't very important. It was much the same during the earliest
days of the Internet and the Web, it was a text-based world here in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   That made good sense because images take up a lot of space _ and
storage memory was at a premium in those days. And, because image
files tend to be large, they took a long time to download or
display while online.
</P>
<P>
   But the world has changed with faster computers and connection
speeds. And, since many of us have personal Web pages, a good
source of free images can be important. They're also useful for
decorating homemade invitations, as accent points in letters and to
create projects for school. The Web is a great source for these
free images and, today, we'll find some of the best spots to get
the picture.
</P>
<P>
   If it's Web page art you'd like, there's a site just for you.
It's called Design-it.Net Free Resources and is located at
design-it.net/graphicsdesigners/freefram.htm. This is a good
resource for the sort of images you'll need for a Web page, but if
that was all this page offered, it wouldn't be too exceptional. The
Web is full of catalogs of art. It's an added feature that makes
this a valuable resource, a great collection of links to Web design
programs and tutorials. After all, it's not enough to just have the
art, you need to know how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   So, browse the links here and you'll find a great way to brush
up on your Web design skills. And it's fairly up-to-date with
information on using the animated images that, over the past couple
of years, have become popular in Web design.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if animated images are your thing, we have a terrific
source that promises (and delivers) thousands of animated images
free for the downloading. You'll find that page at
www.auctionsww.com/freemall
</P>
<P>
   /animations.htm.
</P>
<P>
   You'll not only be impressed with the assortment of images
available here, you'll also like the way the page is organized. If
you've ever tried to search for a specific image on a page that
contains thousands of pictures with subject matter that ranges from
trees to trucks, you know what a chore it can be to find what you
want. But this page makes it easy with categories of images such as
sports, cartoons and signboards (made to be customized with your
own text and used as part of a Web page).
</P>
<P>
   The next Web page we'll visit offers instruction on using your
browser _ whether Netscape or Internet Explorer _ to download
images you find as part of a Web page you visit. The page, located
at webclipart.miningco.com
</P>
<P>
   /library/Tips/blhelp7.htm, has step-by-step instructions for
both PC and Macintosh users on grabbing images and saving them to
your computer. This will be a great help to many novices.
</P>
<P>
   There's one caveat we need to address. Some images are free and
available to anyone. But other images have copyrights and _ while
they can be downloaded _ it isn't legal or proper to do that. So
make sure, when you're mining the Web for images, you respect the
property of others and avoid violating copyright laws.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, since the image you need may be very specific, it could
be you'll need resources other than the usual Web libraries of clip
art we've mentioned. Use your favorite search engine to find the
image you want. Remember, you can use it to search for images, too.
Just include search terms such as ``clip art'' or ``image'' or
``download'' to narrow the search.

 &HT;    Net a new dimension in the coverage of war
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ These are stories about life during wartime.
Real-time, ``you are there'' stories of how people cope daily when
the bombs are dropping nightly.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the age of the Internet could these wartime dramas come
from Belgrade radio station B92 (www.b92.org). That's the
independent Serbian radio station the government shut down April 2.
The station signed off with the words, ``We will never surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Matt Drudge, the one-man Web-based gossip machine who
broke the Monica Lewinsky scandal, spoke to a skeptical crowd at
the Harvard Conference on Internet and Society. The crowd took a
dim view of Drudge's ``one-man-band'' approach to journalism, while
he insisted that in the future anyone with a computer and a modem
could become a publisher and report exactly what they want, and do
it just the way they feel it should be reported.
</P>
<P>
   While Drudge has pretty much dropped off the national radar, in
Serbia there are hundreds of populist journalists bringing their
own perspective to the war _ from angry condemnations of NATO, to
pleas for peace, to simple descriptions of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Even though B92 was shut down, a mirror site was immediately set
up in the Netherlands called ``Help B92'' (helpb92.xs4all.nl/). The
site continues to tell the stories of the people of Yugoslavia with
a special section called ``Personal Diaries.'' The diaries are
stories of the station's friends and colleagues who post, under
their own names, their personal wartime experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``To whom it may concern and to everyone who cares,'' begins one
diary. The writer is from Batajnica, a suburb of Belgrade not far
from a military airbase. He writes, ``I have been in Batajnica up
till now but the situation has become unbearable and terrifying.
The people of this community rarely have the chance to leave the
air raid shelters, since bombs are falling ever closer to my home,
day and night, with few and short interruptions of cease-fire. The
shelters are literally packed with people.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most chilling accounts comes from Vladislava Gordic,
an assistant professor of American and English literature at the
University of Novi Sad. Nightly, she says, she runs back and forth
from the air raid shelter to get her computer and use it to get her
story out to the world, ``as long as phone lines and my modem
permit, I will keep on writing, taking this down.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing of her experiences, she says she is reminded of a Kate
Bush lyric, ``As people around me grow colder, I turn to my
computer.'' She writes of trying to keep up her daily routines _
going to the university to check her mail and talk with the
students still coming to class, along with daily shopping trips to
stock up on supplies.
</P>
<P>
   She notes that as the bombings intensify, so do the items people
consider essential. ``In pharmacie (sic) everybody is asking for
the cheapest tranquilizer _ bensedin. ... The only person I know
that is not taking anything is me, even though everybody else in my
family is taking, not to speak about friends and colleagues. ...
The most animated debates often are around this topic _ what to
take, when and in what quantity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducking in terror in air raid shelters, talking with friends
about the best tranquilizers to cope with another round of bombs _
this is what life is like in Yugoslavia right now, today. As
freedom of the press literally grinds to a halt in Serbia and
Kosovo, these online diarists sending e-mail from air raid shelters
are one of the few ways the rest of the world can find out about
the war and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the online community Egroups also posts as
many daily dispatches as it can on a discussion list called
Kosovo-Reports (www.egroups.com/list/kosovo-reports). It features
postings from anyone actually living in Yugoslavia. Most of the
postings are from Serbs vehemently attacking NATO's bombing
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One list member, Zoran Radoslavjevic, writes that he was sitting
and talking to friends when the bombings began in his town. ``We
knew from cable TV that bombardment would start. But somehow, no
one seemed to believe that, at the end of the 20th century, such
thing was possible. OK, but why Novi Sad, the most peaceful
multiethnical town, that knows no bounderies (sic) among the
nationalities? Suddenly we heard the terrible detonation,
earthquake? No, it has began (sic). We rushed down the stairs, no
sirenes (sic), just children screaming, women crying. ... The
shelter was locked, nowhere to go.... We stood in the street, in
shock, in despair.''

 &HT;    Evolution of the television: HDTV
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's supposed to be the greatest advance in television
since color sets, but almost nobody has access to it _ at least not
yet.
</P>
<P>
   This advance is called High Definition Television, or HDTV. It
offers super-sharp clarity and CD-quality sound. The problem is
HDTV sets are big, some the size of refrigerators, and expensive _
they can cost from $5,000 to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cost, though, HDTV is slowly but surely entering the
marketplace. Some 13,000 sets were sold by the end of 1998, and the
electronics industry estimates a total of 150,000 sets will be sold
by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``HDTV is inching along,'' says Bill Wall, technical director of
the subscriber network unit at Scientific-Atlanta. ``Progress is
made relatively slowly. It's slow but sure.''
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, three stations are already airing some HDTV content.
They are ABC affiliate WSB, NBC affiliate WXIA and CBS affiliate
WGNX.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Scientific-Atlanta has begun shipping a version of
its Explorer 2000 digital cable TV set-top box that can receive
HDTV signals.
</P>
<P>
   While struggling to gain market share, HDTV will command top
attention among broadcasters this week as they gather for their
annual convention in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Some 100,000 network executives, station managers and TV
engineers are expected to attend the show, held by the National
Association of Broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   Attendees include the top brass of Scientific-Atlanta and
Atlanta's seven major commercial stations and Cox Broadcasting,
which owns WSB radio and television stations. Cox Broadcasting is a
unit of Cox Enterprises Inc., which also owns The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a first, cable TV pioneer Ted Turner will attend the
convention, speaking today at a luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   TV executives will be examining digital equipment, discussing
how to make it work and pondering whether to charge viewers for
additional channels carved out of their new spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   It will cost the industry _ the networks and their affiliated
stations _ from $5 billion to $10 billion to convert their
operations to handle digital TV. In addition to the high cost,
viewers appear content with TV as it is _ at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   So then, ``How will the broadcasters make money off digital
TV?'' asks Tom Wolzien, a media analyst at New York investment bank
Sanford Bernstein &AMP; Co. ``What's the demand? There's no way yet to
gauge the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, because HDTV is truly a revolutionary improvement in
television. It's based on digital technology, which can transform
video, sound and data into a stream of ones and zeros.
</P>
<P>
   The same technology powers personal computers and the Internet,
and now it's moving to TV.
</P>
<P>
   HDTV is an advanced form of digital television that provides
video at a very high resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resolution is four times sharper than that of current
TVs,'' says Wall.
</P>
<P>
   HDTV, for example, delivers 2 million pixels _ those are the
dots that make up the picture on the screen _ in contrast to the
current system's 250,000. The higher the number of pixels, the
sharper the picture.
</P>
<P>
   And an HDTV picture has 1,080 lines per screen, nearly double
the current number. The result is a lifelike picture.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is so sold on HDTV that he struck a deal with
broadcasters last year to expedite its rollout. The deal gave every
station a free second channel. In exchange, broadcasters are to use
it to begin airing HDTV programming.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission pressed the nation's 1,500
stations to begin broadcasting now. So far, 42 of them have agreed
to do so. Today, these stations are airing select movies and
sporting events filmed in HDTV format.
</P>
<P>
   Many stations, though, are reluctant to embark on upgrading
their facilities to broadcast HDTV. The technology leaves them in a
Catch 22. HDTV is not just expensive for viewers. It costs, on
average, $5 million to $10 million to equip a station to produce
and send HDTV signals. Stations have to buy new cameras, editing
equipment and antennas, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Converting existing films to HDTV isn't cheap, either. A movie
like ``101 Dalmatians'' costs on average $100,000 to reformat in an
editing studio.
</P>
<P>
   Such high costs are hard to justify when only a handful of
people will be watching HDTV. It's not just that the sets are
expensive. Imagine a refrigerator hung sideways on a wall. That's
the size of most sets today, and few homes can accommodate them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you're interested, you can find sets at various local
stores, including HiFi Buys, Circuit City and Best Buy.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that industry consultant Forrester Research has
concluded HDTV will capture only 1 percent of the market in the
near term.
</P>
<P>
   How then, some wonder, will the TV industry meet the
government's deadline of 2006 for making HDTV the standard?
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget,'' says Yankee Group media analyst Bruce
Leichtman, ``we were under government mandate to switch to the
metric system in the 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Scientific-Atlanta's Wall: ``No one believes the FCC can
stick to its schedule.'' Nonetheless, Wall is convinced HDTV will
someday become the standard for television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all the problems, HDTV is clearly coming,'' he says.
``Remember, color TV was adopted slowly, but almost no one uses a
black-and-white TV today. It will be the same with HDTV.''
</P>
<P>
   To buy or not to buy?
</P>
<P>
   PROS
</P>
<P>
   _ Bright, crystal-clear pictures that make television images
seem almost real.
</P>
<P>
   _ Six-channel, digital surround sound (for folks with properly
equipped audio systems).
</P>
<P>
   _ A new wide television screen, shaped like a movie screen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Digital transmission of the TV signal means the pictures will
be totally free of interference.
</P>
<P>
   _ Digital television signals also can be used to send e-mail,
Web pages, computer software and interactive programming.
</P>
<P>
   CONS
</P>
<P>
   _ High-definition sets sell for $5,000 to $10,000, and the price
probably won't dip below $1,000 for five or six years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most of the sets are huge rear projectors, nearly as large as
a Volkswagen Beetle.

 &HT;    PC World lends advice on Windows 2000
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   In print
</P>
<P>
   For many PC owners, the big question is whether to stick with
Windows 95, upgrade to Windows 98, or wait _ and based on
Microsoft's track record of missing deadlines for new versions of
Windows, it could be a long wait _ for Windows 2000. No one knows
the answer for sure, but you'll get some helpful advice in the May
issue of PC World magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The cover story is ``Ultimate Windows ... Insider's Tips for
Windows 95 and 98.'' And, in the same issue, you'll get the
editors' opinions on whether you should wait for Windows 2000. One
tip offers information on how to speed up Windows by disabling some
of the features that come with Windows 98 including the feature
Microsoft calls the Active Desktop.
</P>
<P>
   If you've never picked up a copy of PC World, this may be a good
time to give it a try, because a third story in the magazine has
some surprising news of Intel loyalists. The magazine reviewed the
new K6-III chip from AMD (a competitor to Intel in the
microprocessor marketplace) and found that chip was actually faster
than the Intel Pentium III chip. Since it's also less expensive,
you may want to read the review and decide for yourself if you'd
like to break ranks with the Intel world.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Do you have designs on a new home, or to remodel your old one?
</P>
<P>
   It can be a confusing process and involves expensive
professionals. Now there's a computer program from a company called
Dream Home Source that claims proudly on the package it's for
``do-it-yourself architects.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that may be a bit too ambitious for most folks but the
program _ called My House 3-D Home Design _ can help you organize
your thoughts and dreams into both interior and exterior drawings
that will, at the least, allow you to communicate your ideas in a
form easy to understand when you meet with an architect or
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The program lives up to the 3-D brag on the box by letting you
rotate the views you design and to even use a feature called 3-D
MovieMaker to create virtual reality tours of the home. You'll also
find templates of typical home layouts that make the process of
designing faster and easier.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   It's the queen of the mountains. Men have died climbing her and
the fascination holds to this day. It's Mount Everest and the
National Geographic has created a Web site that celebrates Everest.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find the site at www.nationalgeographic.com/everest/.
Once there you can read about the Millennium Expedition that plans
to gather some basic information. You may be surprised, for
instance, to learn scientists don't know the exact height of this
famous mountain _ estimates vary. The new expedition intends to
answer this and other questions.

 &HT;    To: Uncle Sam, Re: Kid tax ideas
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A few months back, the folks at Intuit sponsored a
contest that asked kids to tell the government, in 25 words or
less, how to spend our tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   It was win-win for everyone. Intuit makes TurboTax, a popular
brand of tax preparation software. And kids, apparently, say the
darndest things.
</P>
<P>
   The winning entry came from a St. Petersburg, Fla.,
third-grader. In all, 500 entries were received.
</P>
<P>
   St. Pete's Eric Burkett said the government should ``develop a
system that pays kids for doing different types of community
service. Turn the account over to them at the time they get
married.''
</P>
<P>
   For his suggestion, Burkett received a $1,500 contribution to an
education IRA set up by Intuit in his name.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 semi-finalists won $50 U.S. savings bonds.
</P>
<P>
   All the winning entries were delivered to President Clinton, in
plenty of time for their parents to be audited.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Henderson, a fourth-grader from Alpharetta, was the No.
2 semi-finalist. Henderson wrote, ``The government should spend tax
dollars figuring out how to make taxes easier. Parents should spend
time with kids instead of working on taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Maldonaldo, a fourth-grader from Cumming, suggested the
government spend tax money on NASA to enable them ``to destroy
giant meteors before colliding with Earth, destroying all life and
environments, like scientists believe happened to Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   A complete list of the winning entries is available at
www.turbotax.com.
</P>
<P>
   Turning back PC time
</P>
<P>
   Just in time for the Year 2000 bug, comes a software program
called GoBack.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Wild File, a Minnesota-based company, GoBack bills
itself as the ``missing piece of the operating system. It is
neither a backup/restore product nor a utility product. It is a
remarkable tool that integrates itself into the operating system to
protect you from data loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The software, which retails for $69.95, recovers files that have
been deleted or written over, lost from virus attacks, or lost from
problems stemming from installation and system crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Wild File claims the software lets you back out of the problem,
regardless of whether you caused it or a system crash or a virus
attack did. The GoBack software keeps track of every move that
affects your hard disk. The software usually takes up about 10
percent of hard disk memory. It can maintain about a week's worth
of information.
</P>
<P>
   GoBack, according to Wild File, is different from a standard
backup function in that it does not copy the data to a separate
tape or disk.
</P>
<P>
   This is how the technology works: Once a glitch occurs, a
computer user picks the time he or she wants to go back to, up to
one week. Then the user presses a button to either revert the hard
drive or see the hard drive as it appeared at that time. The user
can see the older version of the hard drive through the Internet
browser.
</P>
<P>
   Once installed, GoBack runs automatically. The program is not
designed to replace traditional backup methods. It is intended to
provide the ability to recover information since the last backup.
It also lets a user recover from a system crash without using a
reboot or an operating system disk.
</P>
<P>
   The software, released in December, is designed for users of
Windows 95 and Windows 98. A Windows NT version is to be available
by mid-summer. The software is available at www
</P>
<P>
   .goback.com; www.supershops.com, www.virtual-world.com and www
</P>
<P>
   .tigerdirect.com.

 &HT;    World of backup options explained for benefit of all
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A reader dropped me a line last week asking about
options for backing up his data, which for most of us is one of
those actions that kids refer to as ``let's don't, and say we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   There is probably nothing, outside the pulpit of a church, which
is preached about more and heeded less than backing up one's
computer data. It's a drag, and we think our hard drive, like our
hearts, will go on ticking forever.
</P>
<P>
   If there's anybody reading this who hasn't been bitten by hard
drive failure or accidental or negligent erasure, then they simply
haven't been computing long enough.
</P>
<P>
   There was a day not long ago when the individual computer user's
only backup option was a couple of boxes of 1.44 meg floppies. You
sat there like a frog on a log, popping disks in and out of the
hard drive every few minutes. Needless to say, it was boring.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are a lot of more or less feasible ways of backing up
your hard drive, some of which will probably not even require your
attendance at the ritual. The first thing to consider is what and
how much you're going to back up. Do you want to back up only your
files, or do you want to back up your programs, too? Unless you
have a great abundance of backup space, or you have extensively
personalized and modified your programs, there's really no reason
to back them up. You can simply reinstall them in case of a hard
drive crash.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing you really need to back up are the files and
documents you have created with these programs. To this end, files
and documents ought to be kept in their own directories, and not
lumped in with the program files. It makes setting up a backup much
easier if you can efficiently order entire directories backed up,
instead of thumbing through everything on your hard drive, file by
file.
</P>
<P>
   Word processor documents ought to be kept in their own
directories, under one general master directory such as Windows' My
Documents. Same for worksheets and database files.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget other files that are created more or less
automatically, but are nonetheless irreplaceable. A good example is
your e-mail address book. Identify it and back it up. Same with
your Web browser bookmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the hardware options. The cheapest way by far to back
up vast amounts of data is a tape drive. Hewlett Packward, for
instance, has a 5 gigabyte internal drive using Travan technology
for a mere $169, and a 5-gig tape cartridge is just $25. That's the
cheapest backup option for serious amounts of data I could find.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I have little faith in tape drives. I've had several
and they've all been cranky. They're all slow, too, but that
doesn't matter too much since you can simply schedule the backup
for a time when you're away getting a life.
</P>
<P>
   For small amounts of data, there's the ubiquitous Zip drive from
Iomega. The 100-megabyte size can now be had in the internal model,
which is to be preferred, for less than $100. I've found Zip drives
to be perfectly reliable. The problem with the 100-MB kind is
you're likely going to have to preside over the operation, for one
disk may not hold it all. The disks are also rather pricey for the
capacity _ you can buy a pack of five for $60.
</P>
<P>
   You can go on up the Iomega range to the 250-MB Zip for around
$200 and the 2-gigabyte Jaz drive for about $350. The disks for
that baby run $125 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the optical drive class. I have no experience with
optical drives. A typical one seems to be the Fujitsu DynaMo, which
will store 640 MB on a $25 cartridge. It costs $329, and you'll
need an SCSI card to run it.
</P>
<P>
   Some people install a second hard drive and use it as a mirror
of the main drive. That strikes me as a little risky.
</P>
<P>
   There are computer failures that render the whole machine
senseless, in which case neither hard drive would be accessible
until the problem was fixed. A bad lightning strike, for instance,
could conceivably zap both drives. A fire would do the trick, too.
That, other than various schemes for storing backups in cyberspace
where they would be difficult to reach if your only computer
crashed, pretty well sums up backup options as I understand them.

 &HT;    Enjoy the ads for the Pentium III but don't buy one
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The other night I started thinking about all the money
I've spent that wasn't mine.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, writing a technology column, I've urged you _
with just a touch of hysteria in my voice _ to rush out and buy
faster modems, bigger computers, more memory for the computer you
own, scanners for your photographs, shortwave radios and even a
fancy telescope.
</P>
<P>
   If I got a small cut, based on what the readers of this column
have purchased based on my recommendations, I'd now be out of the
big city and safely back in Arkansas, living happily with my
demented cat in a fieldstone house sitting near the juncture of the
Ouachita and Caddo rivers.
</P>
<P>
   That fieldstone house still sits somewhere in the future since I
don't get a cut. But I guess I do owe you some money and today,
I'll make a payment on that debt. I think I can save you a few
bucks if you're considering buying a new computer.
</P>
<P>
   You've been reading about the new Pentium III chip from Intel
for a few weeks. And the advertising barrage has begun in earnest
now. If you are like most computer users, the first nagging
feelings of inadequacy are beginning. That practically ancient
Pentium II _ my gosh could it be a year old? _ just doesn't seem up
to the complex technological challenges that face it such as
sending e-mail to Aunt Sally, playing Mutant Giant Spiders from
Planet Wazu and designing an invitation for your next party.
</P>
<P>
   You'll pay hundreds of dollars extra for a Pentium III compared
to a Pentium II. And here's what you'll get for your money: Almost
nothing. Your favorite programs may run a millisecond faster. And,
by and by, as new software is created that takes advantage of some
of the unique features of the Pentium III, you should get solid
speed improvements. But it'll be months before that happens.
</P>
<P>
   I'll bet, if you've been around computers longer than four days,
you already know what will happen by the time those months pass.
Raise your hand if you know the answer. OK. You, over there in the
blue lounging pajamas ... what's the answer? Yep. You're right.
Prices will nosedive by then.
</P>
<P>
   So, enjoy the ads for the Pentium III but don't buy one.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, just in case you just have to get more speed out of
your Pentium II, there are some things you can do that will give
you more bang for your dollar. In every case, these are
improvements you'll be able remove from the Pentium II and install
in a new machine when prices do fall.
</P>
<P>
   _ Add more RAM. If you have 32 megabytes of RAM, move to 64; if
you have 64 megabytes, double that amount. Windows 98 and 95 make
good use of RAM, translating the added memory into raw speed.
Here's the good news. You can expect to pay anywhere from $80 to
$100 for a 64 megabyte chip suitable for PCs with a 100 megahertz
bus and much less for slower RAM chips.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get a faster video card. After all, computing is mostly smoke
and mirrors. Everything you do with your computer, from slaying
monsters in a game down to writing a letter using your word
processor is based on graphics written to your screen. So if you
have a video card with 4 megabytes, get one with 8 or even 16
megabytes of VRAM (video random access memory).
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider a faster connection to the Net. Nowadays, most of you
spend hours on the Net. The math works like this: add a slow
connection to a fast computer and you end up with a slow computer.
If you're using an analog modem, make sure it's a good one and that
it operates at 56k bps. If cable modems are available in your area,
consider getting one, the speed increases are more dramatic than
anything you could believe without experiencing it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the best thing about these small improvements:
</P>
<P>
   As soon as software is written to take advantage of the Pentium
IIIs _ and just as important, when the price comes down _ the
faster Net connection, additional RAM and better video card can be
used with the new machine.

 &HT;    Online diarists put it all on the line
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Pamie's on a rant at her Web site, ``Squishy'' _
this time about how relationships change over time, with a handy
``before and after'' guide. After a few months, she says,
television viewing for couples changes:
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch thirty minutes of `Law and Order' and he changes the
channel. `I only like the Law part,' he says. You watch ten minutes
of `Seinfeld.' The commercials come on. He flips, flips, flips,
flips and only pauses on women's golf. `I am not watching this' you
say. `I'm just watching the sports ticker,' he says. He flips back
to `Seinfeld,' just in time for the final `bah-chicka-bah-bah ...
pock-a-pooka-pock.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Television time is his remote control,'' Pamela Ribon (known
as Pamie to her readers) writes on her Web site. Jump to another
Web site: Kramer Wetzel's ``Fishing Guide to the Stars.'' Wetzel is
excited because he just met Amy of ``Amy's Ice Cream'' fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been singing a sweet song about her ice cream for
years,'' Wetzel writes. ``Finally I get to meet the person behind
it all. `Come on by and I'll buy you an ice cream,' she said to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Television has MTV's ``The Real World.'' The big screen has
fictional versions life as we know it in ``Ed TV'' and ``The Truman
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has online diaries such as Ribon's and Wetzel's
that turn life as they know it into virtual entertainment for their
readers.
</P>
<P>
   Some diarists just want to write. Others seek interaction with
readers. Still others have an exhibitionist streak.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the episodic nature of online diaries makes them
popular daily reads, and a growing number of writers are opening up
their diaries to the world.
</P>
<P>
   According to Diarist.net, the most comprehensive list of Web
journals on the Internet, there are about 1,100 active diaries
online. That's not counting thousands more that are unknown or
unavailable to the public. Journals can be as varied as real-life
diaries; some are little more than detailed lists of each day's
events. Others are less linear, putting style over truth and taking
extreme liberties with reality.
</P>
<P>
   Ribon, who performs with the comedy troupe Monk's Night Out and
is in tech support at Tivoli Systems, and Wetzel, a professional
astrologer, are Austinites who have turned their lives into open
books _ or rather, open Web sites _ posting their daily diaries on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   They write about their triumphs (performing at an HBO showcase
in Los Angeles for Ribon, Wetzel's new passion for lawnmower
racing), their tragedies (a three-month ordeal in which Ribon went
through testing for cancer, a near-death experience Wetzel had last
year), and all the minutiae in between.
</P>
<P>
   When Ribon began writing ``Squishy'' last June, she figured it
was a good way to exercise her writing skills. Almost a year later,
she has 500 readers who log in daily for her autobiographical
comedic essays.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid I used to pretend that I was on `The Pam
Channel,' '' Ribon said. ``Other people say they did this as kids,
too _ believing you're exposing yourself to the world. I guess
`Squishy' is a grown-up version of `The Pam Channel,' only this
time it's not just my cat watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Ribon, who says the makers of ``The Truman Show'' ``totally took
my premise,'' writes about her parents, her boyfriend, her stage
performances and her work at Tivoli. When Wetzel began writing a
Web journal as an offshoot of his astrology Web site, his goal was
to chronicle his life and to write about his ongoing love affair
with Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else can you chronicle great things in Texas like
lawnmower racing on Auditorium Shores?'' he said in an interview.
``Can you think of a place that's weirder than Austin?''
</P>
<P>
   Wetzel said he's gotten in trouble in the past writing about
friends or romantic interests. In one instance, a woman who cuts
his hair was upset about a comment he made on site about a hair
streaking she'd performed.
</P>
<P>
   Deb, who asked that her last name not be used, recently removed
her online diary, ``Sometimes Deb,'' from the Web when the pressure
of keeping herself anonymous became too great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never give the Web address to someone I know in real
life,'' she said in an interview. ``I knew there'd be someone out
there reading it, but I didn't really have to deal with their
reactions.''
</P>
<P>
   The diarist's secret life
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Ozawa runs Diarist.net in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often times, online journals are just the next evolutionary
step for people who keep logs of changes to their sites, or people
who write open letters to their family members in lieu of
snail-mail letters or family newsletters,'' Ozawa said. ``Others
see it as therapy, shouting to the world things they might not be
able to whisper to even their closest friends.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also those who promote themselves as the product of
their Web journals. Many writers use their online journals as a way
of sparking interest in their work and some take the idea of an
online identity to another level by adding still photos or live
video. ``There's a certain level where you become a voice,'' Ribon
said. ``And whatever face you have isn't going to match the face
the readers have for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Deb posted a photo of herself with each daily entry. ``Taking a
picture of myself before I started writing was a way for me to
become introspective,'' she said. ``I go to work, take care of the
kids, but when I would sit down to write, I'd shift the focus to
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Ribon and Wetzel could be your neighbor or an
office-mate.
</P>
<P>
   Wetzel, who uses Threadgill's World Headquarters restaurant as
his base of operations for astrology reports, has long hair, a
Texas tan and favors Hawaiian shirts and baggy shorts. He is
self-deprecating, using his Texan lifestyle to skewer
preconceptions readers may have about him: ``Just because I live in
a trailer park, and just because I have fishing poles and a dead
cow skull on my patio, and just because I take a serious dislike to
any kind of a tie besides a bolo tie, does that make a me a
redneck? `` he wrote recently. ``It's warmed up nice in Texas, and
anything besides a pair of shorts is probably too much attire. Is
that so wrong?
</P>
<P>
   When the mood strikes him _ if he's talking to a waitress who
says something particularly insightful or when he gets an
interesting e-mail from a reader, he'll sit down to write, his
short entries leaping in points of reference from ``King of the
Hill'' to ``As You Like It'' to Jupiter's position in the heavens.
``There's not a lot of people out there who can work Shakespeare
and lawnmower racing into a coherent metaphor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ribon, on the other hand, takes about an hour each day to write
an essay on a chosen topic. Ribon, who posts conversations from her
life as dialogue on ``Squishy,'' has written about everything from
nose trimmers to her childhood to her recent use of Tae-Bo exercise
videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have started to feel that tiny muscle that connects your hip
and your thigh. That is the first step to the new Pamie.'' she
wrote in one entry. ``I will have thighs like a stallion, a stomach
like... like a... flat...thing... I'll be the new me.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting them, be warned: The conversation you're having might be
broadcast the next day, used as fuel for tomorrow's entry. ``I was
interviewed for the local paper yesterday afternoon about
`Squishy,''' Ribon wrote after an interview earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, this Saturday there should be an article. And of course
now that hours have gone by since the interview I'm thinking to
myself, ``Did I say the right things?''
</P>
<P>
   And on Wetzel's site: ``I have nothing to fear from another
reporter. The interview went just fine.''

 &HT;    Net a great source for free images
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the earliest days of computing, graphics and images
weren't very important. It was much the same during the earliest
days of the Internet and the Web, it was a text-based world here in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   That made good sense because images take up a lot of space _ and
storage memory was at a premium in those days. And, because image
files tend to be large, they took a long time to download or
display while online.
</P>
<P>
   But the world has changed with faster computers and connection
speeds. And, since many of us have personal Web pages, a good
source of free images can be important. They're also useful for
decorating homemade invitations, as accent points in letters and to
create projects for school. The Web is a great source for these
free images and, today, we'll find some of the best spots to get
the picture.
</P>
<P>
   If it's Web page art you'd like, there's a site just for you.
It's called Design-it.Net Free Resources and is located at
design-it.net/graphicsdesigners/freefram.htm. This is a good
resource for the sort of images you'll need for a Web page, but if
that was all this page offered, it wouldn't be too exceptional. The
Web is full of catalogs of art. It's an added feature that makes
this a valuable resource, a great collection of links to Web design
programs and tutorials. After all, it's not enough to just have the
art, you need to know how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   So, browse the links here and you'll find a great way to brush
up on your Web design skills. And it's fairly up-to-date with
information on using the animated images that, over the past couple
of years, have become popular in Web design.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if animated images are your thing, we have a terrific
source that promises (and delivers) thousands of animated images
free for the downloading. You'll find that page at
www.auctionsww.com/freemall
</P>
<P>
   /animations.htm.
</P>
<P>
   You'll not only be impressed with the assortment of images
available here, you'll also like the way the page is organized. If
you've ever tried to search for a specific image on a page that
contains thousands of pictures with subject matter that ranges from
trees to trucks, you know what a chore it can be to find what you
want. But this page makes it easy with categories of images such as
sports, cartoons and signboards (made to be customized with your
own text and used as part of a Web page).
</P>
<P>
   The next Web page we'll visit offers instruction on using your
browser _ whether Netscape or Internet Explorer _ to download
images you find as part of a Web page you visit. The page, located
at webclipart.miningco.com
</P>
<P>
   /library/Tips/blhelp7.htm, has step-by-step instructions for
both PC and Macintosh users on grabbing images and saving them to
your computer. This will be a great help to many novices.
</P>
<P>
   There's one caveat we need to address. Some images are free and
available to anyone. But other images have copyrights and _ while
they can be downloaded _ it isn't legal or proper to do that. So
make sure, when you're mining the Web for images, you respect the
property of others and avoid violating copyright laws.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, since the image you need may be very specific, it could
be you'll need resources other than the usual Web libraries of clip
art we've mentioned. Use your favorite search engine to find the
image you want. Remember, you can use it to search for images, too.
Just include search terms such as ``clip art'' or ``image'' or
``download'' to narrow the search.

 &HT;    Net a new dimension in the coverage of war
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ These are stories about life during wartime.
Real-time, ``you are there'' stories of how people cope daily when
the bombs are dropping nightly.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the age of the Internet could these wartime dramas come
from Belgrade radio station B92 (www.b92.org). That's the
independent Serbian radio station the government shut down April 2.
The station signed off with the words, ``We will never surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Matt Drudge, the one-man Web-based gossip machine who
broke the Monica Lewinsky scandal, spoke to a skeptical crowd at
the Harvard Conference on Internet and Society. The crowd took a
dim view of Drudge's ``one-man-band'' approach to journalism, while
he insisted that in the future anyone with a computer and a modem
could become a publisher and report exactly what they want, and do
it just the way they feel it should be reported.
</P>
<P>
   While Drudge has pretty much dropped off the national radar, in
Serbia there are hundreds of populist journalists bringing their
own perspective to the war _ from angry condemnations of NATO, to
pleas for peace, to simple descriptions of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Even though B92 was shut down, a mirror site was immediately set
up in the Netherlands called ``Help B92'' (helpb92.xs4all.nl/). The
site continues to tell the stories of the people of Yugoslavia with
a special section called ``Personal Diaries.'' The diaries are
stories of the station's friends and colleagues who post, under
their own names, their personal wartime experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``To whom it may concern and to everyone who cares,'' begins one
diary. The writer is from Batajnica, a suburb of Belgrade not far
from a military airbase. He writes, ``I have been in Batajnica up
till now but the situation has become unbearable and terrifying.
The people of this community rarely have the chance to leave the
air raid shelters, since bombs are falling ever closer to my home,
day and night, with few and short interruptions of cease-fire. The
shelters are literally packed with people.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most chilling accounts comes from Vladislava Gordic,
an assistant professor of American and English literature at the
University of Novi Sad. Nightly, she says, she runs back and forth
from the air raid shelter to get her computer and use it to get her
story out to the world, ``as long as phone lines and my modem
permit, I will keep on writing, taking this down.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing of her experiences, she says she is reminded of a Kate
Bush lyric, ``As people around me grow colder, I turn to my
computer.'' She writes of trying to keep up her daily routines _
going to the university to check her mail and talk with the
students still coming to class, along with daily shopping trips to
stock up on supplies.
</P>
<P>
   She notes that as the bombings intensify, so do the items people
consider essential. ``In pharmacie (sic) everybody is asking for
the cheapest tranquilizer _ bensedin. ... The only person I know
that is not taking anything is me, even though everybody else in my
family is taking, not to speak about friends and colleagues. ...
The most animated debates often are around this topic _ what to
take, when and in what quantity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducking in terror in air raid shelters, talking with friends
about the best tranquilizers to cope with another round of bombs _
this is what life is like in Yugoslavia right now, today. As
freedom of the press literally grinds to a halt in Serbia and
Kosovo, these online diarists sending e-mail from air raid shelters
are one of the few ways the rest of the world can find out about
the war and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the online community Egroups also posts as
many daily dispatches as it can on a discussion list called
Kosovo-Reports (www.egroups.com/list/kosovo-reports). It features
postings from anyone actually living in Yugoslavia. Most of the
postings are from Serbs vehemently attacking NATO's bombing
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One list member, Zoran Radoslavjevic, writes that he was sitting
and talking to friends when the bombings began in his town. ``We
knew from cable TV that bombardment would start. But somehow, no
one seemed to believe that, at the end of the 20th century, such
thing was possible. OK, but why Novi Sad, the most peaceful
multiethnical town, that knows no bounderies (sic) among the
nationalities? Suddenly we heard the terrible detonation,
earthquake? No, it has began (sic). We rushed down the stairs, no
sirenes (sic), just children screaming, women crying. ... The
shelter was locked, nowhere to go.... We stood in the street, in
shock, in despair.''

 &HT;    Evolution of the television: HDTV
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's supposed to be the greatest advance in television
since color sets, but almost nobody has access to it _ at least not
yet.
</P>
<P>
   This advance is called High Definition Television, or HDTV. It
offers super-sharp clarity and CD-quality sound. The problem is
HDTV sets are big, some the size of refrigerators, and expensive _
they can cost from $5,000 to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cost, though, HDTV is slowly but surely entering the
marketplace. Some 13,000 sets were sold by the end of 1998, and the
electronics industry estimates a total of 150,000 sets will be sold
by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``HDTV is inching along,'' says Bill Wall, technical director of
the subscriber network unit at Scientific-Atlanta. ``Progress is
made relatively slowly. It's slow but sure.''
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, three stations are already airing some HDTV content.
They are ABC affiliate WSB, NBC affiliate WXIA and CBS affiliate
WGNX.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Scientific-Atlanta has begun shipping a version of
its Explorer 2000 digital cable TV set-top box that can receive
HDTV signals.
</P>
<P>
   While struggling to gain market share, HDTV will command top
attention among broadcasters this week as they gather for their
annual convention in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Some 100,000 network executives, station managers and TV
engineers are expected to attend the show, held by the National
Association of Broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   Attendees include the top brass of Scientific-Atlanta and
Atlanta's seven major commercial stations and Cox Broadcasting,
which owns WSB radio and television stations. Cox Broadcasting is a
unit of Cox Enterprises Inc., which also owns The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a first, cable TV pioneer Ted Turner will attend the
convention, speaking today at a luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   TV executives will be examining digital equipment, discussing
how to make it work and pondering whether to charge viewers for
additional channels carved out of their new spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   It will cost the industry _ the networks and their affiliated
stations _ from $5 billion to $10 billion to convert their
operations to handle digital TV. In addition to the high cost,
viewers appear content with TV as it is _ at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   So then, ``How will the broadcasters make money off digital
TV?'' asks Tom Wolzien, a media analyst at New York investment bank
Sanford Bernstein &AMP; Co. ``What's the demand? There's no way yet to
gauge the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, because HDTV is truly a revolutionary improvement in
television. It's based on digital technology, which can transform
video, sound and data into a stream of ones and zeros.
</P>
<P>
   The same technology powers personal computers and the Internet,
and now it's moving to TV.
</P>
<P>
   HDTV is an advanced form of digital television that provides
video at a very high resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resolution is four times sharper than that of current
TVs,'' says Wall.
</P>
<P>
   HDTV, for example, delivers 2 million pixels _ those are the
dots that make up the picture on the screen _ in contrast to the
current system's 250,000. The higher the number of pixels, the
sharper the picture.
</P>
<P>
   And an HDTV picture has 1,080 lines per screen, nearly double
the current number. The result is a lifelike picture.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is so sold on HDTV that he struck a deal with
broadcasters last year to expedite its rollout. The deal gave every
station a free second channel. In exchange, broadcasters are to use
it to begin airing HDTV programming.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission pressed the nation's 1,500
stations to begin broadcasting now. So far, 42 of them have agreed
to do so. Today, these stations are airing select movies and
sporting events filmed in HDTV format.
</P>
<P>
   Many stations, though, are reluctant to embark on upgrading
their facilities to broadcast HDTV. The technology leaves them in a
Catch 22. HDTV is not just expensive for viewers. It costs, on
average, $5 million to $10 million to equip a station to produce
and send HDTV signals. Stations have to buy new cameras, editing
equipment and antennas, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Converting existing films to HDTV isn't cheap, either. A movie
like ``101 Dalmatians'' costs on average $100,000 to reformat in an
editing studio.
</P>
<P>
   Such high costs are hard to justify when only a handful of
people will be watching HDTV. It's not just that the sets are
expensive. Imagine a refrigerator hung sideways on a wall. That's
the size of most sets today, and few homes can accommodate them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you're interested, you can find sets at various local
stores, including HiFi Buys, Circuit City and Best Buy.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that industry consultant Forrester Research has
concluded HDTV will capture only 1 percent of the market in the
near term.
</P>
<P>
   How then, some wonder, will the TV industry meet the
government's deadline of 2006 for making HDTV the standard?
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget,'' says Yankee Group media analyst Bruce
Leichtman, ``we were under government mandate to switch to the
metric system in the 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Scientific-Atlanta's Wall: ``No one believes the FCC can
stick to its schedule.'' Nonetheless, Wall is convinced HDTV will
someday become the standard for television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all the problems, HDTV is clearly coming,'' he says.
``Remember, color TV was adopted slowly, but almost no one uses a
black-and-white TV today. It will be the same with HDTV.''
</P>
<P>
   To buy or not to buy?
</P>
<P>
   PROS
</P>
<P>
   _ Bright, crystal-clear pictures that make television images
seem almost real.
</P>
<P>
   _ Six-channel, digital surround sound (for folks with properly
equipped audio systems).
</P>
<P>
   _ A new wide television screen, shaped like a movie screen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Digital transmission of the TV signal means the pictures will
be totally free of interference.
</P>
<P>
   _ Digital television signals also can be used to send e-mail,
Web pages, computer software and interactive programming.
</P>
<P>
   CONS
</P>
<P>
   _ High-definition sets sell for $5,000 to $10,000, and the price
probably won't dip below $1,000 for five or six years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most of the sets are huge rear projectors, nearly as large as
a Volkswagen Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ability to receive high-definition programming carried by
cable is in its infancy (Scientific-Atlanta has begun shipping a
set-top box that can receive HDTV signals).
</P>
<P>
   _ Television programming filmed or taped in the last 50 years
was shot for today's square screen sets.
</P>
<P>
   _ The new wide-screen HDTVs will show programs in a vertical
``letterbox,'' with broad gray bands on the left and right of the
screen.

 &HT;    PC World lends advice on Windows 2000
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   In print
</P>
<P>
   For many PC owners, the big question is whether to stick with
Windows 95, upgrade to Windows 98, or wait _ and based on
Microsoft's track record of missing deadlines for new versions of
Windows, it could be a long wait _ for Windows 2000. No one knows
the answer for sure, but you'll get some helpful advice in the May
issue of PC World magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The cover story is ``Ultimate Windows ... Insider's Tips for
Windows 95 and 98.'' And, in the same issue, you'll get the
editors' opinions on whether you should wait for Windows 2000. One
tip offers information on how to speed up Windows by disabling some
of the features that come with Windows 98 including the feature
Microsoft calls the Active Desktop.
</P>
<P>
   If you've never picked up a copy of PC World, this may be a good
time to give it a try, because a third story in the magazine has
some surprising news of Intel loyalists. The magazine reviewed the
new K6-III chip from AMD (a competitor to Intel in the
microprocessor marketplace) and found that chip was actually faster
than the Intel Pentium III chip. Since it's also less expensive,
you may want to read the review and decide for yourself if you'd
like to break ranks with the Intel world.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Do you have designs on a new home, or to remodel your old one?
</P>
<P>
   It can be a confusing process and involves expensive
professionals. Now there's a computer program from a company called
Dream Home Source that claims proudly on the package it's for
``do-it-yourself architects.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that may be a bit too ambitious for most folks but the
program _ called My House 3-D Home Design _ can help you organize
your thoughts and dreams into both interior and exterior drawings
that will, at the least, allow you to communicate your ideas in a
form easy to understand when you meet with an architect or
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The program lives up to the 3-D brag on the box by letting you
rotate the views you design and to even use a feature called 3-D
MovieMaker to create virtual reality tours of the home. You'll also
find templates of typical home layouts that make the process of
designing faster and easier.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   It's the queen of the mountains. Men have died climbing her and
the fascination holds to this day. It's Mount Everest and the
National Geographic has created a Web site that celebrates Everest.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find the site at www.nationalgeographic.com/everest/.
Once there you can read about the Millennium Expedition that plans
to gather some basic information. You may be surprised, for
instance, to learn scientists don't know the exact height of this
famous mountain _ estimates vary. The new expedition intends to
answer this and other questions.

 &HT;    To: Uncle Sam, Re: Kid tax ideas
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A few months back, the folks at Intuit sponsored a
contest that asked kids to tell the government, in 25 words or
less, how to spend our tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   It was win-win for everyone. Intuit makes TurboTax, a popular
brand of tax preparation software. And kids, apparently, say the
darndest things.
</P>
<P>
   The winning entry came from a St. Petersburg, Fla.,
third-grader. In all, 500 entries were received.
</P>
<P>
   St. Pete's Eric Burkett said the government should ``develop a
system that pays kids for doing different types of community
service. Turn the account over to them at the time they get
married.''
</P>
<P>
   For his suggestion, Burkett received a $1,500 contribution to an
education IRA set up by Intuit in his name.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 semi-finalists won $50 U.S. savings bonds.
</P>
<P>
   All the winning entries were delivered to President Clinton, in
plenty of time for their parents to be audited.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Henderson, a fourth-grader from Alpharetta, was the No.
2 semi-finalist. Henderson wrote, ``The government should spend tax
dollars figuring out how to make taxes easier. Parents should spend
time with kids instead of working on taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Maldonaldo, a fourth-grader from Cumming, suggested the
government spend tax money on NASA to enable them ``to destroy
giant meteors before colliding with Earth, destroying all life and
environments, like scientists believe happened to Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   A complete list of the winning entries is available at
www.turbotax.com.
</P>
<P>
   Turning back PC time
</P>
<P>
   Just in time for the Year 2000 bug, comes a software program
called GoBack.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Wild File, a Minnesota-based company, GoBack bills
itself as the ``missing piece of the operating system. It is
neither a backup/restore product nor a utility product. It is a
remarkable tool that integrates itself into the operating system to
protect you from data loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The software, which retails for $69.95, recovers files that have
been deleted or written over, lost from virus attacks, or lost from
problems stemming from installation and system crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Wild File claims the software lets you back out of the problem,
regardless of whether you caused it or a system crash or a virus
attack did. The GoBack software keeps track of every move that
affects your hard disk. The software usually takes up about 10
percent of hard disk memory. It can maintain about a week's worth
of information.
</P>
<P>
   GoBack, according to Wild File, is different from a standard
backup function in that it does not copy the data to a separate
tape or disk.
</P>
<P>
   This is how the technology works: Once a glitch occurs, a
computer user picks the time he or she wants to go back to, up to
one week. Then the user presses a button to either revert the hard
drive or see the hard drive as it appeared at that time. The user
can see the older version of the hard drive through the Internet
browser.
</P>
<P>
   Once installed, GoBack runs automatically. The program is not
designed to replace traditional backup methods. It is intended to
provide the ability to recover information since the last backup.
It also lets a user recover from a system crash without using a
reboot or an operating system disk.
</P>
<P>
   The software, released in December, is designed for users of
Windows 95 and Windows 98. A Windows NT version is to be available
by mid-summer. The software is available at www

 &HT;    World of backup options explained for benefit of all
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A reader dropped me a line last week asking about
options for backing up his data, which for most of us is one of
those actions that kids refer to as ``let's don't, and say we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   There is probably nothing, outside the pulpit of a church, which
is preached about more and heeded less than backing up one's
computer data. It's a drag, and we think our hard drive, like our
hearts, will go on ticking forever.
</P>
<P>
   If there's anybody reading this who hasn't been bitten by hard
drive failure or accidental or negligent erasure, then they simply
haven't been computing long enough.
</P>
<P>
   There was a day not long ago when the individual computer user's
only backup option was a couple of boxes of 1.44 meg floppies. You
sat there like a frog on a log, popping disks in and out of the
hard drive every few minutes. Needless to say, it was boring.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are a lot of more or less feasible ways of backing up
your hard drive, some of which will probably not even require your
attendance at the ritual. The first thing to consider is what and
how much you're going to back up. Do you want to back up only your
files, or do you want to back up your programs, too? Unless you
have a great abundance of backup space, or you have extensively
personalized and modified your programs, there's really no reason
to back them up. You can simply reinstall them in case of a hard
drive crash.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing you really need to back up are the files and
documents you have created with these programs. To this end, files
and documents ought to be kept in their own directories, and not
lumped in with the program files. It makes setting up a backup much
easier if you can efficiently order entire directories backed up,
instead of thumbing through everything on your hard drive, file by
file.
</P>
<P>
   Word processor documents ought to be kept in their own
directories, under one general master directory such as Windows' My
Documents. Same for worksheets and database files.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget other files that are created more or less
automatically, but are nonetheless irreplaceable. A good example is
your e-mail address book. Identify it and back it up. Same with
your Web browser bookmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the hardware options. The cheapest way by far to back
up vast amounts of data is a tape drive. Hewlett Packward, for
instance, has a 5 gigabyte internal drive using Travan technology
for a mere $169, and a 5-gig tape cartridge is just $25. That's the
cheapest backup option for serious amounts of data I could find.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I have little faith in tape drives. I've had several
and they've all been cranky. They're all slow, too, but that
doesn't matter too much since you can simply schedule the backup
for a time when you're away getting a life.
</P>
<P>
   For small amounts of data, there's the ubiquitous Zip drive from
Iomega. The 100-megabyte size can now be had in the internal model,
which is to be preferred, for less than $100. I've found Zip drives
to be perfectly reliable. The problem with the 100-MB kind is
you're likely going to have to preside over the operation, for one
disk may not hold it all. The disks are also rather pricey for the
capacity _ you can buy a pack of five for $60.
</P>
<P>
   You can go on up the Iomega range to the 250-MB Zip for around
$200 and the 2-gigabyte Jaz drive for about $350. The disks for
that baby run $125 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the optical drive class. I have no experience with
optical drives. A typical one seems to be the Fujitsu DynaMo, which
will store 640 MB on a $25 cartridge. It costs $329, and you'll
need an SCSI card to run it.
</P>
<P>
   Some people install a second hard drive and use it as a mirror
of the main drive. That strikes me as a little risky.
</P>
<P>
   There are computer failures that render the whole machine
senseless, in which case neither hard drive would be accessible
until the problem was fixed. A bad lightning strike, for instance,
could conceivably zap both drives. A fire would do the trick, too.
That, other than various schemes for storing backups in cyberspace
where they would be difficult to reach if your only computer
crashed, pretty well sums up backup options as I understand them.

 &HT;    Enjoy the ads for the Pentium III but don't buy one
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The other night I started thinking about all the money
I've spent that wasn't mine.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, writing a technology column, I've urged you _
with just a touch of hysteria in my voice _ to rush out and buy
faster modems, bigger computers, more memory for the computer you
own, scanners for your photographs, shortwave radios and even a
fancy telescope.
</P>
<P>
   If I got a small cut, based on what the readers of this column
have purchased based on my recommendations, I'd now be out of the
big city and safely back in Arkansas, living happily with my
demented cat in a fieldstone house sitting near the juncture of the
Ouachita and Caddo rivers.
</P>
<P>
   That fieldstone house still sits somewhere in the future since I
don't get a cut. But I guess I do owe you some money and today,
I'll make a payment on that debt. I think I can save you a few
bucks if you're considering buying a new computer.
</P>
<P>
   You've been reading about the new Pentium III chip from Intel
for a few weeks. And the advertising barrage has begun in earnest
now. If you are like most computer users, the first nagging
feelings of inadequacy are beginning. That practically ancient
Pentium II _ my gosh could it be a year old? _ just doesn't seem up
to the complex technological challenges that face it such as
sending e-mail to Aunt Sally, playing Mutant Giant Spiders from
Planet Wazu and designing an invitation for your next party.
</P>
<P>
   You'll pay hundreds of dollars extra for a Pentium III compared
to a Pentium II. And here's what you'll get for your money: Almost
nothing. Your favorite programs may run a millisecond faster. And,
by and by, as new software is created that takes advantage of some
of the unique features of the Pentium III, you should get solid
speed improvements. But it'll be months before that happens.
</P>
<P>
   I'll bet, if you've been around computers longer than four days,
you already know what will happen by the time those months pass.
Raise your hand if you know the answer. OK. You, over there in the
blue lounging pajamas ... what's the answer? Yep. You're right.
Prices will nosedive by then.
</P>
<P>
   So, enjoy the ads for the Pentium III but don't buy one.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, just in case you just have to get more speed out of
your Pentium II, there are some things you can do that will give
you more bang for your dollar. In every case, these are
improvements you'll be able remove from the Pentium II and install
in a new machine when prices do fall.
</P>
<P>
   _ Add more RAM. If you have 32 megabytes of RAM, move to 64; if
you have 64 megabytes, double that amount. Windows 98 and 95 make
good use of RAM, translating the added memory into raw speed.
Here's the good news. You can expect to pay anywhere from $80 to
$100 for a 64 megabyte chip suitable for PCs with a 100 megahertz
bus and much less for slower RAM chips.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get a faster video card. After all, computing is mostly smoke
and mirrors. Everything you do with your computer, from slaying
monsters in a game down to writing a letter using your word
processor is based on graphics written to your screen. So if you
have a video card with 4 megabytes, get one with 8 or even 16
megabytes of VRAM (video random access memory).
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider a faster connection to the Net. Nowadays, most of you
spend hours on the Net. The math works like this: add a slow
connection to a fast computer and you end up with a slow computer.
If you're using an analog modem, make sure it's a good one and that
it operates at 56k bps. If cable modems are available in your area,
consider getting one, the speed increases are more dramatic than
anything you could believe without experiencing it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the best thing about these small improvements:
</P>
<P>
   As soon as software is written to take advantage of the Pentium
IIIs _ and just as important, when the price comes down _ the
faster Net connection, additional RAM and better video card can be
used with the new machine.

 &HT;    Online diarists put it all on the line
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Pamie's on a rant at her Web site, ``Squishy'' _
this time about how relationships change over time, with a handy
``before and after'' guide. After a few months, she says,
television viewing for couples changes:
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch thirty minutes of `Law and Order' and he changes the
channel. `I only like the Law part,' he says. You watch ten minutes
of `Seinfeld.' The commercials come on. He flips, flips, flips,
flips and only pauses on women's golf. `I am not watching this' you
say. `I'm just watching the sports ticker,' he says. He flips back
to `Seinfeld,' just in time for the final `bah-chicka-bah-bah ...
pock-a-pooka-pock.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Television time is his remote control,'' Pamela Ribon (known
as Pamie to her readers) writes on her Web site. Jump to another
Web site: Kramer Wetzel's ``Fishing Guide to the Stars.'' Wetzel is
excited because he just met Amy of ``Amy's Ice Cream'' fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been singing a sweet song about her ice cream for
years,'' Wetzel writes. ``Finally I get to meet the person behind
it all. `Come on by and I'll buy you an ice cream,' she said to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Television has MTV's ``The Real World.'' The big screen has
fictional versions life as we know it in ``Ed TV'' and ``The Truman
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has online diaries such as Ribon's and Wetzel's
that turn life as they know it into virtual entertainment for their
readers.
</P>
<P>
   Some diarists just want to write. Others seek interaction with
readers. Still others have an exhibitionist streak.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the episodic nature of online diaries makes them
popular daily reads, and a growing number of writers are opening up
their diaries to the world.
</P>
<P>
   According to Diarist.net, the most comprehensive list of Web
journals on the Internet, there are about 1,100 active diaries
online. That's not counting thousands more that are unknown or
unavailable to the public. Journals can be as varied as real-life
diaries; some are little more than detailed lists of each day's
events. Others are less linear, putting style over truth and taking
extreme liberties with reality.
</P>
<P>
   Ribon, who performs with the comedy troupe Monk's Night Out and
is in tech support at Tivoli Systems, and Wetzel, a professional
astrologer, are Austinites who have turned their lives into open
books _ or rather, open Web sites _ posting their daily diaries on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   They write about their triumphs (performing at an HBO showcase
in Los Angeles for Ribon, Wetzel's new passion for lawnmower
racing), their tragedies (a three-month ordeal in which Ribon went
through testing for cancer, a near-death experience Wetzel had last
year), and all the minutiae in between.
</P>
<P>
   When Ribon began writing ``Squishy'' last June, she figured it
was a good way to exercise her writing skills. Almost a year later,
she has 500 readers who log in daily for her autobiographical
comedic essays.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid I used to pretend that I was on `The Pam
Channel,' '' Ribon said. ``Other people say they did this as kids,
too _ believing you're exposing yourself to the world. I guess
`Squishy' is a grown-up version of `The Pam Channel,' only this
time it's not just my cat watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Ribon, who says the makers of ``The Truman Show'' ``totally took
my premise,'' writes about her parents, her boyfriend, her stage
performances and her work at Tivoli. When Wetzel began writing a
Web journal as an offshoot of his astrology Web site, his goal was
to chronicle his life and to write about his ongoing love affair
with Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else can you chronicle great things in Texas like
lawnmower racing on Auditorium Shores?'' he said in an interview.
``Can you think of a place that's weirder than Austin?''
</P>
<P>
   Wetzel said he's gotten in trouble in the past writing about
friends or romantic interests. In one instance, a woman who cuts
his hair was upset about a comment he made on site about a hair
streaking she'd performed.
</P>
<P>
   Deb, who asked that her last name not be used, recently removed
her online diary, ``Sometimes Deb,'' from the Web when the pressure
of keeping herself anonymous became too great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never give the Web address to someone I know in real
life,'' she said in an interview. ``I knew there'd be someone out
there reading it, but I didn't really have to deal with their
reactions.''
</P>
<P>
   The diarist's secret life
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Ozawa runs Diarist.net in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often times, online journals are just the next evolutionary
step for people who keep logs of changes to their sites, or people
who write open letters to their family members in lieu of
snail-mail letters or family newsletters,'' Ozawa said. ``Others
see it as therapy, shouting to the world things they might not be
able to whisper to even their closest friends.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also those who promote themselves as the product of
their Web journals. Many writers use their online journals as a way
of sparking interest in their work and some take the idea of an
online identity to another level by adding still photos or live
video. ``There's a certain level where you become a voice,'' Ribon
said. ``And whatever face you have isn't going to match the face
the readers have for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Deb posted a photo of herself with each daily entry. ``Taking a
picture of myself before I started writing was a way for me to
become introspective,'' she said. ``I go to work, take care of the
kids, but when I would sit down to write, I'd shift the focus to
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Ribon and Wetzel could be your neighbor or an
office-mate.
</P>
<P>
   Wetzel, who uses Threadgill's World Headquarters restaurant as
his base of operations for astrology reports, has long hair, a
Texas tan and favors Hawaiian shirts and baggy shorts. He is
self-deprecating, using his Texan lifestyle to skewer
preconceptions readers may have about him: ``Just because I live in
a trailer park, and just because I have fishing poles and a dead
cow skull on my patio, and just because I take a serious dislike to
any kind of a tie besides a bolo tie, does that make a me a
redneck? `` he wrote recently. ``It's warmed up nice in Texas, and
anything besides a pair of shorts is probably too much attire. Is
that so wrong?
</P>
<P>
   When the mood strikes him _ if he's talking to a waitress who
says something particularly insightful or when he gets an
interesting e-mail from a reader, he'll sit down to write, his
short entries leaping in points of reference from ``King of the
Hill'' to ``As You Like It'' to Jupiter's position in the heavens.
``There's not a lot of people out there who can work Shakespeare
and lawnmower racing into a coherent metaphor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ribon, on the other hand, takes about an hour each day to write
an essay on a chosen topic. Ribon, who posts conversations from her
life as dialogue on ``Squishy,'' has written about everything from
nose trimmers to her childhood to her recent use of Tae-Bo exercise
videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have started to feel that tiny muscle that connects your hip
and your thigh. That is the first step to the new Pamie.'' she
wrote in one entry. ``I will have thighs like a stallion, a stomach
like... like a... flat...thing... I'll be the new me.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting them, be warned: The conversation you're having might be
broadcast the next day, used as fuel for tomorrow's entry. ``I was
interviewed for the local paper yesterday afternoon about
`Squishy,''' Ribon wrote after an interview earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, this Saturday there should be an article. And of course
now that hours have gone by since the interview I'm thinking to
myself, ``Did I say the right things?''
</P>
<P>
   And on Wetzel's site: ``I have nothing to fear from another
reporter. The interview went just fine.''

 &HT;    Confessions of a diarist: Heather is me
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``Writing is supposed to be a kind of
confessional, transmogrified a little, but ultimately the place
where your triumphs of pride and the sins of your past are blended
with fictions.'' _ Heather Yi
</P>
<P>
   About six months ago, I had one of those creative bursts of
energy, the kind of sunbolt energy that warrants more than the
production of a greeting card or a short story. The kind that can
lead, when used, to novels or skyscrapers or symphonies.
</P>
<P>
   But I wasn't that ambitious. I just wanted to write a little
something and e-mail it to a few friends. I created a character
named Heather Yi, who wrote a first-person account of her life at
the University of Texas and about a classmate, Gina. The fictional
diary was e-mailed to friends, but I didn't tell anyone that
Heather Yi wasn't real. After a while, interest spread and I
decided to post the entries on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The result, ``gina,'' was more writing exercise than magnus
opus, but as an experiment, it taught me about more than just
writing consistently. Putting the journals on the Internet, under
the conceit that Gina and Heather were real people living their
lives on the site, showed me how malleable identity can be on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet users at some point have run into a case of
mistaken identity _ the person in the chat room who isn't who they
say they are, the person who may have the same last name and a
similar e-mail address, e-mails from anonymous spammers whose name
you will never know.
</P>
<P>
   But for a few months, as the Gina and Heather saga developed
into a 200-page mini-novel with character arcs, subplots and an
evolving theme, people read the journals religiously because,
unlike a novel, these people were real. The difference between
following the life of a fictional character and the life of a real
person is enormous. As Heather wrote her journal entries, readers
offered advice, admonished her for being too critical and related
their own stories about similar situations .
</P>
<P>
   And, while great writers consistently make characters that live
and breathe on the page, the rapport readers developed with Heather
Yi (who had an e-mail account on Hotmail) had more to do with the
anonymous, open nature of the Net than to the writing skills of
Heather's creator.
</P>
<P>
   Whether ``gina'' was successful as a work of writing doesn't
matter; the experiment, at least for me, succeeded because readers
began to care for these characters, following their lives, sharing
their dreams and disappointments. The fictional adventures of
Heather and Gina became an experience for this audience. And,
because it was supposed to be real, even a casual reader could
write in and affect the outcome _ which they did. The immediate and
often very frank feedback shaped the story and the writing as it
continued.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has become a place where those who want attention
can set up cameras in their home and broadcast their lives to the
world. It has become a place where a child's birth can be witnessed
live, in color, on any computer capable of watching. It has become
a place where, just like on television, celebrities can hawk bad
products and let the world see their plastic surgery as it is being
performed.
</P>
<P>
   But, most importantly, it's a place where strangers have learned
to care about other strangers and to reach out, communicating with
those they would never otherwise meet.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who partake in that confessional, putting our
most intimate thoughts and our best words out there for anyone who
cares to read, there are few things more rewarding.

into a 200-page mini-novel with character arcs, subplots and an
evolving theme, people read the journals religiously because,
unlike a novel, these people were real. The difference between
following the life of a fictional character and the life of a real
person is enormous. As Heather wrote her journal entries, readers
offered advice, admonished her for being too critical and related
their own stories about similar situations .
</P>
<P>
   And, while great writers consistently make characters that live
and breathe on the page, the rapport readers developed with Heather
Yi (who had an e-mail account on Hotmail) had more to do with the
anonymous, open nature of the Net than to the writing skills of
Heather's creator.
</P>
<P>
   Whether ``gina'' was successful as a work of writing doesn't
matter; the experiment, at least for me, succeeded because readers
began to care for these characters, following their lives, sharing
their dreams and disappointments. The fictional adventures of
Heather and Gina became an experience for this audience. And,
because it was supposed to be real, even a casual reader could
write in and affect the outcome _ which they did. The immediate and
often very frank feedback shaped the story and the writing as it
continued.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has become a place where those who want attention
can set up cameras in their home and broadcast their lives to the
world. It has become a place where a child's birth can be witnessed
live, in color, on any computer capable of watching. It has become
a place where, just like on television, celebrities can hawk bad
products and let the world see their plastic surgery as it is being
performed.
</P>
<P>
   But, most importantly, it's a place where strangers have learned
to care about other strangers and to reach out, communicating with
those they would never otherwise meet.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who partake in that confessional, putting our
most intimate thoughts and our best words out there for anyone who
cares to read, there are few things more rewarding.

SEEKING TO CHAINSAW THE MEDICINE WHEEL HISTORIC PRESERVATION PLAN

<P>
   Once again, the drive for profit would invade sacred ground. A
Wyoming sawmill company has filed a civil suit against the U.S.
Forest Service for closing off a portion of the Bighorn National
Forest to harvesting timber. That portion of the national forest
contains a site sacred to many American Indian tribes, including
the Crow, Arapaho, Shoshone, Bannock, Blackfeet, Sioux, Plains Cree
and the Northern Cheyenne.
</P>
<P>
   The disputed area lies within the boundaries of the Forest
Service's Historic Preservation Plan for the Medicine Wheel
National Historic Landmark and Medicine Mountain. The Medicine
Wheel, an 80-foot-diameter circle with 28 rock spokes radiating
from a central, hollow cairn, is located atop the 10,000-foot
Medicine Mountain in Big Horn County, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Medicine Wheel and the mountain are considered sacred
to tribes and are a significant part of the cultural heritage of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For over six years, numerous diverse groups participated in
developing the Medicine Wheel preservation plan: the Big Horn
County Commissioners, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation,
Medicine Wheel Coalition for Sacred Sites of North America,
Medicine Wheel Alliance, State Historic Preservation Office,
Federal Aviation Administration (which operates a long-range radar
facility located on Medicine Mountain), and Forest Service managers
of the Bighorn National Forest. They worked together to protect a
valuable cultural and spiritual resource.
</P>
<P>
   But trees must be cut for timber. So Mountain State Legal
Foundation out of Denver, which has an unfortunate tendency to see
the protection of American Indian sacred sites as a violation of
the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, filed suit for Wyoming
Sawmills Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Bighorn National Forest includes more than a million acres;
approximately 40 percent of that acreage contains timber that can
be harvested. The land set aside for the Medicine Wheel Historic
Preservation Plan is a mere 18,000 acres, and less than 60 percent
of it is forested. It hardly seems necessary to go after timber
situated within a cultural landmark.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed by Mountain States Legal Foundation alleges
that the Forest Service's Historic Preservation Plan for the
Medicine Wheel National Historic Landmark and vicinity cancels
timber sales and timber harvesting for the ``sole purpose of
furthering Native American religions'' and ``to advance the
practice of Native American religions.''
</P>
<P>
   The four other claims made in the lawsuit allege that the Forest
Service did not follow federal guidelines when establishing the
Historic Preservation Plan. They are the obligatory, kitchen-sink
allegations found in most lawsuits. In a preservation plan that is
so complex, it is possible some federal guideline was overlooked.
It is clear the lawsuit hinges on the legal foundation's allegation
that setting up this historic preservation plan and closing off
portions of the forest to timber harvesting violates the
Establishment Clause: ``Congress shall make no law respecting an
establishment of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Medicine Wheel is the main feature in the preservation area.
But the surrounding acres contain various alignments of rocks, tipi
rings, travois trails, and caves used for tribal ceremonies. One
trail leads from the Yellowstone National Park over the Bighorn
Mountains to the Medicine Wheel. Although the origin of the
Medicine Wheel has been lost in antiquity, there is little doubt of
its ceremonial significance to American Indian tribes. Evidence
indicates that the area had been used by Indian tribes for nearly
7,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 20,000 visitors who came to view the Medicine Wheel
last year may have sensed the spiritual nature of this sacred site.
While there are non-Indians who scoff at the very notion of sacred
sites, it is deeply embedded in European tradition. There are
temples in Greece, Turkey and other parts of Europe that were built
over centuries, one upon another to glorify different deities. At
one site in Greece, a temple built to a goddess of fertility was
rebuilt to worship Athena, and much later rebuilt again to
celebrate the Virgin Mary. Those sites were recognized as somehow
sacred, somehow deeply spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   But the complex spiritual nature of Medicine Mountain and its
Medicine Wheel does not lend itself easily to such comparisons.
Many Indian tribal leaders regard Medicine Mountain as the
significant spiritual landscape and the Medicine Wheel as a
component of that landscape.
</P>
<P>
   How then, does a sawmill company, which must bid on timber sales
in national forests, lose if a small percentage of the total
acreage of the Bighorn National Forest is closed to timber
harvesting? And if there is a loss, what is it compared to the
preservation of sacred ground?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has lived near logging roads knows the dust and
noise, the whine and roar of truck engines. Anyone who has heard
chainsaws used to down trees knows the unrelenting buzz and brack
of steel against live wood. How is one to seek the spiritual with
the shrill screech of profiteering ringing in the soul? Where there
is no silence, there is no spiritual solace.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has walked in mountains anywhere knows the importance
of silence, the importance of feeling at one with the land we walk
upon, the importance of recognizing some essence beyond ourselves.
Silence allows us to explore that realm.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicine Wheel Historic Preservation Plan accommodates
American Indian religions, as it should. The plan does not prohibit
Wyoming Sawmills Inc. from making a profit from timber harvesting
in other areas of the Bighorn National Forest. There is no clash of
one against the other. And there is no Establishment Clause
violation here, only wise accommodation to the best in all of us _
a recognition that every culture's religious beliefs deserve
protection.

NEW OVEN WILL DOUBLE YOUR COOKING PLEASURE
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Cooking convenience is the name of the game for
busy families, especially in kitchens without much space.
</P>
<P>
   But it can be frustrating when trying to cook several dishes at
different temperatures in one oven, particularly for those who shun
microwaves or who don't own a toaster oven.
</P>
<P>
   To address this dilemma, Maytag Appliances has come up with one
solution that will be available at retail stores in July.
</P>
<P>
   It's an electric range with two ovens, allowing cooks to prepare
different menu items simultaneously at different times and
temperatures. It provides similar benefits to a double-wall oven
without the expense and hassle of remodeling.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Gemini range, it takes its name from the zodiac sign
of the twins and has one oven to accommodate large items such as a
Thanksgiving turkey and a smaller oven above it that heats up twice
as quickly to bake, broil, warm and toast with accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two ovens provide a full 5.2 cubic feet of
capacity in the same space as a conventional freestanding range.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller oven, which can be used for food ranging from baked
potatoes to mini-pizzas, as well as heating rolls or keeping foods
and dishes warm, has an autoset temperature of 170. There's also a
scrolling control that gives automatic prompts when entering
cooking commands and allows the customization of clock options,
such as reminder beeps when baking time is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Priced at $1,399, the Gemini twin-oven range is scheduled to be
available in three colors _ white, black and a brushed chrome
finish.

GUTERSON IS BACK WITH A COMPELLING DRAMA
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) 
 By JUDYTH RIGLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Guterson captivated readers with his 1994 novel, ``Snow
Falling on Cedars,'' a tightly crafted literary thriller about a
racially charged murder trial in post-World War II Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The book's engrossing plot line aside, Guterson's gift for
descriptive passages stirred an interest in the Pacific Northwest
something akin to what ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil''
did for Savannah, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' has sold more than 3 million copies
in hardback and paperback.
</P>
<P>
   Guterson's name and pictures (invariably showing his ruggedly
handsome frame clad in flannel shirts and jeans, seated on a tree
trunk on his Bainbridge Island property) have been splashed all
over newspapers and magazines. The movie version of ``Snow,''
starring Ethan Hawke, will be released in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the teacher-turned-novelist has given us a second
novel, ``East of the Mountains'' (Harcourt Brace, $25). It shares
the Washington state setting of its predecessor, but little else
(except, we're delighted to report, the writer's gift for
spellbinding storytelling).
</P>
<P>
   Guterson doesn't keep the reader in suspense about his plot line
for very long. Here's his opening sentence: ``On the night he had
appointed his last among the living, Dr. Ben Givens did not dream,
for his sleep was restless and visited by phantoms who guarded the
portal to the world of dreams by speaking relentlessly of this
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben is a 73-year-old retired heart surgeon who has inoperable
colon cancer; the near-constant pain in his gut and a rapidly
declining energy level are steady reminders of what lies ahead.
Still reeling from the death of his beloved wife, Rachel, a year
and a half earlier, Ben has decided to go off in the woods with his
hunting dogs and stage an ``accident'' rather than die in agony,
slowly.
</P>
<P>
   As he sets off on his final hunt, Ben indulges himself in
memories: of growing up on his father's apple farm; of falling in
love with Rachel and enduring a separation while she served as an
Army nurse in France during World War II and he fought in Italy; of
the pleasures of the outdoors and the joys of bird-hunting with
well-trained dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Ben recognizes the irony of spending a career saving lives, yet
being unable to save his own; but he is not bitter. The reader
quickly decides that Ben would be a good man to spend time with, as
do several characters Ben meets when his carefully crafted plan
begins to unravel after he wrecks his car.
</P>
<P>
   Just when he has decided that there is nothing left to lose, no
reason to go on, Ben learns that life always has some surprises in
store and that, sometimes, what you think is the end is only
another kind of beginning.
</P>
<P>
   To Guterson's everlasting credit, there is not a shred of
sentimentalism here despite the well-traveled and oft-cliched
territory of loss and pain.
</P>
<P>
   Using his skills of characterization and description, he makes
Ben's difficult journey bearable, our insights both personal and
universal.
</P>
<P>
   With a first printing of 500,000 copies, Harcourt Brace has
shown faith in Guterson's second time at bat; from here, it looks
as if he's hit another home run.

TOIL, TROUBLE WELCOMED SHAKESPEARE'S NEW CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RICHARD MATTURRO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ We're making much of the turn of the century this
year. With William Shakespeare's birthday coming up on April 23, an
Academy Award-winning film about him playing in the theaters, and
Harold Bloom's new book, ``Shakespeare: The Invention of the
Human,'' on best-seller lists around the country, let's pause for a
moment to consider the turbulent times that Shakespeare faced in
the waning days of the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
   When Shakespeare was born in 1564, Queen Elizabeth had been on
the throne for six years, and she would remain the only monarch
Shakespeare knew for most of his life. It was a heady time in
England. In 1588, the small navy of that small island had defeated
Spain, the greatest sea power on Earth. The religious conflicts
that plagued the continent and even plagued Britain before
Elizabeth's reign were largely absent due to the queen's shrewd
tolerance of religious differences.
</P>
<P>
   There was a thriving economy. There were voyages of discovery to
the New World. And in literature, Elizabeth presided over the
greatest flowering since the Golden Age of Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many saw a serpent lurking in Gloriana's garden. Elizabeth
had no heir. For reasons which were perhaps political, personal or
both, she never married. The recent film about Elizabeth shows her
cavorting in bed with her lover, the Earl of Leicester. Considering
the unreliability of birth control in Renaissance England, it is
doubtful that such a scene ever took place.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligent and prudent in all her other dealings, Elizabeth is
unlikely to have taken such a risk. She may indeed have earned the
title, ``Virgin Queen,'' which we can scarce utter without a smirk.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of an heir, however, was a serious problem. The English
Wars of the Roses, which Shakespeare himself dramatized on the
London stage, had ended barely 100 years before, more recent to
Shakespeare's audience than our own Civil War is to us. And what
the Red and the White Rose factions had fought over was the
succession. No one wanted that chaos to come again.
</P>
<P>
   Not having produced an heir, Elizabeth was urged by her council
to name a successor, something she steadfastly refused to do.
Again, her reasons might have been personal or political, but in
any case she kept mum.
</P>
<P>
   The dawn of the new century brought the crisis. Elizabeth was in
her late 60s, and her new favorite, the Earl of Essex, tried to
incite a rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know what Shakespeare thought about Elizabeth. His only
surviving reference to her in her lifetime is a brief poetic
tribute embedded in ``A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' a play the queen
probably attended. Nor do we know for sure what he thought about
Essex, but Essex was a close friend of the Earl of Southampton, the
man to whom Shakespeare dedicated ``Venus and Adonis,'' arguably
the most popular poem of the age.
</P>
<P>
   It was Essex, too, who paid Shakespeare's company to revive an
old play, ``Richard II,'' on the eve of the rebellion on Feb. 8,
1601.
</P>
<P>
   It was the closest Shakespeare ever got to being in trouble with
the law. Richard II, a flawed monarch, is deposed in the course of
the play, and Essex imagined that the London public would see the
parallel with Elizabeth and rally to his cause. They did not, and
Essex was quickly apprehended.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare's company was hauled in for questioning, but
exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth lived for two more years, and died never having named
a successor. Yet, for all the anxiety over who would rule after
her, the transition of power was one of the smoothest in English
history.
</P>
<P>
   Upon her death in 1603, Elizabeth's council offered the crown to
her distant cousin, James, the king of Scotland. James readily
accepted, thereby merging the two kingdoms.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Shakespeare may have felt during this eventful time,
his company certainly benefited from the new regime. King James, it
turned out, loved the theater, loved it almost as much as he loved
demonology and witchcraft. He adopted Shakespeare's company, and
they became known as the King's Men from then on.
</P>
<P>
   To honor their patron, Shakespeare wrote a new play. Set in
Scotland, not overly long (for James had a short attention span),
it told an old tale from Scottish history, and for the king's
special delight, Shakespeare filled it with witches and necromancy.
</P>
<P>
   We know the play as ``Macbeth.''

`BUGS LIFE' RIGHT AT HOME ON SMALL SCREEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As he calls from New York City, Thomas Schumacher,
president of Walt Disney Animation, is looking out of his hotel
window onto Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have almost the view you have a couple of times when Flik
goes to Bug City,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher is referring to scenes in last year's Disney animated
hit ``A Bug's Life'' and its hero. The film comes out on video and
DVD Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look down the street toward downtown and you look over
to the right where it would be the corner of 42nd and Seventh,'' he
continues, referring to the film, ``you actually see a little `Lion
King' sign, because John is a big `Lion King' fan.''
</P>
<P>
   The John he's referring to is Pixar's John Lasseter, the
director and writer of the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fun to look at John's movies and seeing all the
details. It's the greatest asset of video and certainly DVD.''
</P>
<P>
   (``A Bug's Life'' lists for $26.95 for VHS and $34.99 for DVD,
and will include both sets of comic animated outtakes that ran in
theaters.)
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Lasseter, who also directed ``Toy Story'' and has
``Toy Story 2'' coming out for the holidays, is excited by the fact
that ``A Bug's Life'' is the first film to be digitally transferred
directly from the original computer imagery rather than the
standard film-to-video process.
</P>
<P>
   Lasseter, who was calling while he drove to work at Pixar, says
they have done two things to make ``A Bug's Life,'' which looked
spectacular in theaters, play great on video.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the making of `Toy Story' we (were) constantly striving
to correct the color but we never quite got the same quality we had
on our high-resolution monitors. So, for `A Bug's Life,' we made a
digital video copy every time we finished a scene. So, for the
video release we went back and remastered the movie in digital
video.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasseter says that this eliminates the weave and dust hairs
associated with film. And if a person buys ``A Bug's Life'' on DVD
it's a true first, because it's the first time a film has been
created digitally, remastered digitally and viewed at home
digitally.
</P>
<P>
   And ``A Bug's Life'' does, indeed, look spectacular on video,
even on a regular TV. Like other video releases, ``A Bug's Life'' _
which was made for the wide screen _ will be offered in letterbox
format, but Lasseter and Pixar made some adjustments for those who
watch the regular format.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to transfer (a wide-screen film) to video because
you're only getting a portion of the movie as you saw it in the
theater, and it's always very frustrating. So that people at home
could see the movie as we intended, we went back and reframed many,
many shots. Sometimes we kept the same frame width and just added
the extra part of the frame above and below to fill it in. Other
times we actually recomposed the frame by moving the characters
closer together and recomputing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasseter and Schumacher are excited by the advances in
technology, but both stress that it's imagination that will govern
the real advances in animation. At Disney, Schumacher is in a
position to see what's happening. The Mouse has four major animated
features coming out in a little more than a year: ``Tarzan,'' ``Toy
Story 2,'' ``Fantasia 2000'' and ``Dinosaur'' for Memorial Day
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the medium is still artist-dependent, Schumacher says,
only with new tools _ computers. ``Dinosaur,'' he says, is far more
realistic-looking computer animation than anything so far, while
``Tarzan'' uses a completely different digital technology than ``A
Bug's Life,'' making the traditionally painted background look
three-dimensional.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medium itself is going to keep blending with all other
aspects of film, with some things going to look highly realistic,
and some things are going to be cartoony.'' But the decision of
what to use will depend on the story, Schumacher emphasizes.
</P>
<P>
   The pair also are aware that many people don't see a film until
it comes out on video.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a movie of this type gets into video, that's when people
and families see it again and again and again,'' Lasseter says,
``and it really becomes part of the culture, you might say.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Lasseter knows that he's making films for more than the
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I jokingly say that you not only make these films for the
first time a person sees it, but for the 100th time a parent has to
suffer through it on video.'' &UR;  &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; For nearly as long as man has been on this Earth,
mycobacterium tuberculosis _ the bacteria that causes tuberculosis
_ has been his deadly partner.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the discovery that antibiotics can cure most cases of
TB, the disease _ which continues to infect an estimated one-third
of the world's population _ is growing more drug-resistant.
</P>
<P>
   That has doctors worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuberculosis is the Slobodan Milosevic of infectious
organisms,'' said Tarzana internist Dr. Michael Hirt, who diagnoses
and treats a half-dozen TB patients annually. ``It requires
prolonged bombardment in order to make it surrender. And sometimes
even that doesn't work. It's survived this long because it's built
strength.''

   The World Health Organization estimates that about 8 million
people worldwide are newly infected by TB each year, and that in
1999, 3.1 million people worldwide will die from the ailment. Only
16 percent of sufferers get treatment, according to WHO.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is rosier in the United States. In 1998, the fifth
straight year of diminishing cases, 18,371 cases of TB were
reported, down 7.5 percent from 19,851 cases in 1997, according to
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors who gathered in Florida on March 24 _ on World
Tuberculosis Day, the 117th anniversary of the day the TB bacteria
was first identified under the microscope _ were reluctant to cheer
the apparent success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend more in the U.S. on (thinning) hair-care treatments
than tuberculosis treatment,'' complained Ray Collins,
superintendent of the A.G. Holley State Hospital in Florida, the
nation's last TB treatment center.
</P>
<P>
   But there are doctors trying to find a cure for the worldwide
scourge.
</P>
<P>
   St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in New York has
launched a national study to see whether ultraviolet germicidal
irradiation and better ventilation will kill TB germs. This summer,
the Los Angeles Mission will be one of the study's test sites.
</P>
<P>
   And the National Institutes of Health, the CDC and the WHO are
working together on plans to develop a vaccine to prevent TB. But
medical experts say the cure _ if it is ever found _ is probably
many years away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like trying to find a vaccine for HIV,'' said Dr. Paul
Davidson, director of the Tuberculosis Control Program for the Los
Angeles County Department of Health Services. ``It's a very
complicated thing. I think it'll be a minimum of 20 years before a
vaccine is developed and tested. And we're talking about probably
50 years before it's available to the world as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   In those decades, many more people will contract the disease.
Even in the U.S., which has the highest treatment and cure rate,
medical experts fear the disease has the potential to mushroom as
the population of people with compromised immune systems (the aging
and people with HIV/AIDS, for example) increases. WHO estimates
that every person with TB infects 15 to 20 others in just one year.
</P>
<P>
   It's a frightening prospect, especially because the potentially
fatal disease can be spread to a susceptible person by a cough or a
sneeze, a laugh or a song, or even a conversation, said Paula
Rutan, a Los Angeles County Department of Health Services public
health nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Once a person is exposed to the disease, it can lie dormant in
the body until the bacteria finds a way past a person's immune
system, when it can flare up and spread, Rutan said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' high immigration rate and crowded urban setting
makes it a breeding ground for TB, said Davidson. Los Angeles
County's TB rate of 14.9 cases per 100,000 people in 1998 was
double the U.S. rate of 7.4, and higher than the state's 12.6 rate.
</P>
<P>
   A person's chances of being exposed to the disease are just as
close as the person in the next seat on an airplane, in the
library, or at a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disease that truly knows no boundaries,'' Hirt said.
``Wrong time, wrong place, and you can be exposed to somebody with
TB very briefly and be infected.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of how easily the disease is spread, before children can
start school in Los Angeles County, they must show that they tested
negative for TB within the past 12 months. Although children do
contract the disease, they are not generally considered contagious
because they usually can't cough deep enough to spread the bacteria
to others, Rutan said.
</P>
<P>
   The county Department of Health Services, which treats TB
patients who do not have insurance or cannot pay for their own
treatment, spends more than $10 million a year on drugs to fight
the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Most patients willingly comply with the order that they be
quarantined for two to four weeks, until treatment makes them no
longer contagious. But some TB sufferers balk at taking the
medication, quit taking it before the infection is gone, or refuse
to isolate themselves while they are contagious. So the Health
Department seeks court orders a dozen times a year to force
compliance _ in the isolation of a hospital or jail _ until all
danger of contagion is past.
</P>
<P>
   Health workers take a quarantine seriously. In Stockton, a
grandfather diagnosed with incurable TB is in jail, and his son,
daughter and daughter-in-law face child endangerment charges for
allowing their children to visit their quarantined grandfather. The
man's 1-year-old grandson and 2-year-old granddaughter, whom the
Health Department had ordered to stay away, are infected with the
same drug-resistant strain of TB that their grandfather has.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a rare situation,'' Davidson said, ``but people in
public health care are prepared to do whatever we have to do to
keep TB from spreading.'' &QL;

THE FACTS ABOUT TB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Egyptians documented the disease in tomb
paintings dating back to 3000 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, most people died from what was then called
``consumption.''
</P>
<P>
   And the bacterial infection, now known as tuberculosis,
afflicted all classes, including famous folks such as gunslinger
``Doc'' Holliday, pianist Frederic Chopin, former first lady
Eleanor Roosevelt and novelist Robert Lewis Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the symptoms?
</P>
<P>
   A: Coughing, fever, night sweats, chest pain, fatigue and weight
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is TB diagnosed?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are three stages of testing: a skin test, in which a
testing medium called tuberculin is injected under the skin; a
chest X-ray; and a sputum test. If the skin test is negative, the
person has not been exposed to the TB bacteria; if the test is
positive (the bump at the injection site grows in size and becomes
red), a chest X-ray will be taken; if that shows a shadow on the
lung, a sputum test is ordered to confirm the diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is TB treated?
</P>
<P>
   A: Generally two, or as many as five or six, antibiotics are
given, generally twice a week for six to nine months. But some TB
sufferers have such serious infections that antibiotics will not
cure them; eventually, they die.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do the bacteria come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: Once rampant worldwide, TB was controlled in the United
States in the mid-1940s with the discovery of streptomycin. Now,
the infection is often brought into the United States by immigrants
from countries with high TB rates. It often spreads in areas where
many people are crowded together. Lack of light and poor
ventilation help the bacteria multiply.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is TB spread?
</P>
<P>
   A: When an infected person coughs, sneezes, laughs or talks,
small droplets are emitted into the air; the bacteria exists in
those droplets. Anyone who breathes those droplets may come down
with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How soon does a TB infection show up?
</P>
<P>
   A: It may show up within weeks, or may lie dormant in the body
for years. Some exposed people may never develop the disease, while
it may flare up in others as their immune systems become
compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is most susceptible?
</P>
<P>
   A: The very young and the very old, people who are 10 percent or
more below their ideal weight, people whose immune systems are
compromised, diabetics, substance abusers, people who are
recovering from throat or mouth surgery, and people suffering from
end-stage kidney disease.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can you avoid being exposed to TB?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only sure way is to never go outside your house and never
let anybody else in or, if you venture out, to wear a surgical
mask, both impractical solutions. But to minimize your risk, ask
people to cover their nose and mouth when they cough or sneeze (and
do the same yourself), keep your distance from coughers or
sneezers, keep your surroundings clean and wash your hands often. &QL;

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending April 10 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.

TEXAS TOWN STRUGGLES WITH LESSONS OF BRUTAL KILLING
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) 
 By CARY CLACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ For 10 months, how and why James Byrd Jr. died
has forced the town of Jasper to look at itself and reflect on its
character.
</P>
<P>
   On June 7, 1998, three young white men allegedly beat Byrd
before tying him to the back of a pick-up truck and dragging him
for three miles along a rural road, a gruesome journey that ended
when the black man's body slammed into a concrete culvert that tore
off his head and right arm.
</P>
<P>
   John King, has been convicted in the murder; his accused
accomplices, Russell Brewer and Shawn Berry, await trial.
</P>
<P>
   Since the crime, the people of Jasper have sought to understand
how their town could have produced one of the most notorious racist
crimes in the United States since the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Rather then shun the spotlight, the residents have used the
exposure to try to demonstrate that they are good people who
shouldn't be judged by what happened to James Byrd; that, yes, they
have racial problems, but it's a town where people try to work
together and in which blacks, who make up 45 percent of the
population, hold a number of important and elected positions,
including mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper, population 7,120, is an ordinary town defined by an
extraordinary horror. But what should frighten the rest of the
nation about Jasper is that it is so ordinary, a community like any
other that was coasting along the road of unresolved and unspoken
racial problems until a mad pre-dawn ride slammed it into reality.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than use Jasper as a scapegoat for America's racist sins,
the nation had best use it as a cautionary tale of the consequences
of unchecked hate.
</P>
<P>
   For just as Jasper peers into Byrd's tomb to examine itself, the
nation need only to look at Jasper to see its own reflection.
</P>
<P>
   There is no corridor of burning crosses and nooses hanging from
pine trees to greet you as you drive into Jasper on Texas 96, the
main strip through town cluttered with fast-food restaurants and
other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   It is in eateries, gas stations, the grocery store, the car wash
on Pollard Street, Sandy Creek Park, on the streets and in
neighborhoods whose lawns blush with azaleas that the blacks and
whites of Jasper mingle, talk and laugh. And, of course, there's
that great multiracial meeting place of American democracy,
Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   This is how they lived before June 7, 1998, as well as since,
though perhaps with a bit more thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's helped this town,'' Diane Cox, owner of the Book
Emporium &AMP; Gallery, said about the Byrd killing. ``The whole
community is making an effort to be nice.''
</P>
<P>
   The people of Jasper are working harder at a civility that they
once took for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the comments are made by whites such as Cox. But she
isn't one to paint a picture of a Jasper devoid of race problems.
She said that when she moved here from Birmingham, Ala., 23 years
ago, ``It was like stepping back in time.''
</P>
<P>
   She scoffs at the removal, in January, of the rusty iron fence
in the Jasper City Cemetery that separated the graves of blacks
from those of whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the most ridiculous thing,'' she said. ``Not that I
agreed with the fence. But when they bury someone of color on the
white side, then I know there would have been change. But I don't
think it's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In the cemetery, on an overcast Good Friday, Vaye Wood, a
37-year-old black woman who grew up in Jasper but now lives in
Dallas, drove up to Byrd's grave with her mother, Juanita Walker.
She rolled down her window and stared pensively at the grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first time seeing it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Byrd case indicated the town had a racial problem,
both women emphatically answered no.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not,'' Wood said. ``I never had this kind of problem.
When I was a girl I went over to white girl's houses and they came
over to mine.''
</P>
<P>
   At Billy's BBQ, a small wooden red building on North Main, a
middle-aged black woman with short hair tinted blue waited for her
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the `The Jewel of the Forest,''' Willie M. Sharp proudly
called her hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't resent it,'' she said of Jasper's stigma since the
Byrd slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think it's making us stronger. Everyone knows that's
not the way it is here. We're showing the world that.''

</P>
<P>
   When Willis Webb interviewed for the job of editor and publisher
of the Jasper Newsboy eight years ago, he asked about the state of
race relations in the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, everything is great,'' was the overly enthusiastic reply
he received.
</P>
<P>
   Now Webb is able to offer his own assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been unfairly stigmatized,'' said Webb, 61.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ``Unless we kid ourselves, all is not right with
race relations. We have a lot of disenfranchised black people. If I
were black, I'd be angry as hell.''
</P>
<P>
   With an unemployment rate of 11 percent in Jasper County, the
county seat is struggling economically, creating, said Webb, an
invisible wall that blocks residents economically whether white or
black.
</P>
<P>
   Webb is a member of the Mayor's Task Force 2000 that was formed
by city leaders and clergy, after Byrd's death, to help reconcile
racial differences.
</P>
<P>
   He is ``cautiously hopeful'' that something good will come out
of it.
</P>
<P>
   What's most important, he said, is for everyone to accept
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We each have to ask ourselves, what little have I done that
might have contributed to this, that allowed this to happen. I
didn't know the three guys but if I did and heard one of them say,
`I hate blacks' and didn't challenge him, I contributed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the disenfranchised young blacks Webb spoke about is
Derric Muhammad, a 33-year-old sales representative who belongs to
the Nation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like any other town, city or village,'' the Jasper native
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world ain't nothing but a ghetto. I don't care where you
go. I can go down to Houston and get the same kind of treatment
from anybody. The world ain't nothing but a ghetto, so I don't just
stigmatize Jasper, but I do know Jasper. A lot of people were
surprised and I was shocked at it (Byrd's murder), but I ain't
going to say it caught me by surprise. That's just some mentality
anywhere you go. They just happened to act on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad also is a member of the Mayor's Task Force 2000, albeit
a skeptical one. ``You can't help none who doesn't want to help
themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every discussion about the Byrd case is punctuated with
praise for the Byrd family and the way they have conducted
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they'd not been the kind of family they were, this place
would have been burned to the ground,'' Webb said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Byrd family really kept this town together,'' Cox
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, James Byrd Sr. and his wife, Stella, have become the
first family of Jasper, a position attained by the dignity and
strength they have displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Byrd politely declined a request for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm up to it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was understood.

MORE THAN `JUST A FRIEND' 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Every time a new nurse, lab technician or doctor
came into M.E.'s nook in the emergency room, she or he would say to
me: ``Are you her daughter?''
</P>
<P>
   Each time, I answered the same way: ``No, just a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did I tack on that diminishing qualifier? Just a friend.
</P>
<P>
   As if friendship were some minor league entity in the great game
of human relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The only person who didn't get the ``just'' answer was a
Catholic priest we'd gotten out of bed at 4 a.m. because M.E.
already knew she'd had a heart attack and suspected she might buy
the farm. The reverend father didn't want to know who I was but
only, ``Would you like to take communion, too?''
</P>
<P>
   All the while that I was with M.E. in the emergency room and the
intensive care unit (until they took her for a heart
catheterization and suggested I go home and sleep), our friend
Carolyn was back at M.E.'s house. Her task was to watch over M.E.'s
roommate of 37 years, a woman who is disabled by Alzheimer's
disease and cannot be alone.
</P>
<P>
   As the days wore on into the next week _ M.E. did not buy the
farm _ Carolyn, I and a handful of other just-friends coalesced
into a sort of multiheaded rescue unit.
</P>
<P>
   Phoning each other several times a day, we coordinated with a
terrific agency called Help at Home for 24-hour care for M.E.'s
roomie. We called M.E.'s sisters and other kin back East and her
closest friends in the San Francisco area. We canceled standing
appointments the two women had for everything from mammograms to
hair cuts.
</P>
<P>
   After M.E.'s name went on the prayer list at our church, fellow
parishioners asked what they could do. Grocery lists were compiled,
filled and delivered. Fresh flowers and communion made their way to
M.E.'s hospital room.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody brought her the newspapers she ached to catch up on,
and somebody else gathered up some makeup so she could put on a
little lipstick and feel less like something the cat dragged in.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, some folks actually put aside their revulsion at used,
stinking kitty litter and cleaned out the box that M.E.'s pair of
poor, confused cats had saturated.
</P>
<P>
   If I make the whole process sound seamless and easy, it wasn't.
Everyone on the multiheaded unit has a full-time, demanding job
except M.E.'s friend Joan. She's retired but carries around a
fairly sizable load of stress herself these days because her own
housemate is undergoing mega-chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Joan found (or created) the time to pitch in. Funny how
you can do that when you absolutely have to. And want to.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to explain this to a man earlier this week when he asked
what I'd been doing lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's great,'' he said. ``Then when you need help down the
road, somebody might be there for you.''
</P>
<P>
   I said it didn't have anything to do with down the road or
trying to sow good karma. It had to do with being somebody's friend
NOW.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, after I'd relieved Carolyn and taken M.E.'s
roommate out for a walk in the sunshine, I was driving back to
work, listening to Dr. Laura Schlessinger practice her
healing-through-humiliation on the usual sorry lineup of radio
clients. (I make myself listen to Dr. Laura at least once a week as
a reminder of how much money there is in emotional S&AMP;M.)
</P>
<P>
   On this day, the good ``doctor'' was on a roll about the
throw-away mentality of people who ``shack up,'' men and women who
``cohabitate and fornicate'' and then ditch their alleged loved
ones at the first sign of rough road.
</P>
<P>
   Properly married people who've made a ``real commitment'' to one
another, she said, know they must hang in there and take care of
each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the difference between being married and shacking up,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   I thought about all the gay men I know in this town who've
nursed lovers and friends through years of pain from AIDS. I
thought about unmarried heterosexuals who've taken care of lovers
and friends through mental and physical illness, injury and
poverty. And I thought about our multiheaded rescue unit that had
materialized almost as swiftly as the paramedics did the night of
M.E.'s heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   All of us certainly seem bound and committed, but by what? Not
blood or formal vow.
</P>
<P>
   Might the glue be love? That deep, powerful force that (sorry,
Dr. Laura) is not the exclusive domain of properly married women
and men. The kind of love that shows there is no such thing as
``just'' a friend.

   BRAZDA, Macedonia _ In the days before Jeton Hasani saw what a
5-year-old should never see, the warmest moments of his life were
spent sitting in his grandmother's lap as she darned socks and he
watched cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   Then Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic unleashed a brutal
campaign that forced more than a half-million Kosovars, most of
whom are children like Jeton, out of their homes and running for
their lives from burning villages.
</P>
<P>
   Deep wounds _ physical and emotional _ have befallen the
youngest refugees of the war for Kosovo. Childhood, for them, is no
longer just a time of innocence and play. The inheritors of
Milosevic's destruction, they are now children of war.
</P>
<P>
   You can't see the damage in Jeton's eyes or in the shy smile he
gives a stranger. But it is there, his parents say. He doesn't
sleep. He is easily frightened. He won't leave his mother's side.
</P>
<P>
   On the second night of NATO's airstrikes, Serb forces fired a
mortar shell into Jeton's hometown of Metrovica. It exploded in the
garden. His grandmother, trying to find cover, was hit.
</P>
<P>
   The blast knocked out electricity. The family cowered in deep
darkness inside their home. They heard Arifa Hasani, 57, a
matriarch of five children and 10 grandchildren, gasping in the
hallway. Jeton's uncle lit a lighter. In the flickering glow, Jeton
saw his bloodied grandmother, dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is at an age where he will never forget,'' said Fatmire
Hasani, 30, his aunt. ``We're afraid this image will never
disappear. He wakes up at night and he is very afraid and never
lets his mother leave him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatmire, a teacher with a gift for dealing with children, said
Jeton was extraordinarily close to his grandmother. They spent
every day together, and the boy smiles now when his mother shows
him a cracked photograph of his grandmother holding him as a baby.
He asks for her at night.
</P>
<P>
   The morning after the family buried Arifa in the garden, armed
Serb paramilitaries came to the home and ordered the family to
leave. The family clambered into a tractor and began a one-week
odyssey through Kosovo. They landed in the misery of the ``no man's
land'' on the Macedonian border. Ultimately, they ended up in tent
number D-284, where the family has been for over a week. Inside the
tent on Thursday night, Jeton sat in his mother's lap, clinging to
her and staring out at a descending darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of this conflict has already taken a deep toll on
children. But international relief workers here and in Albania say
they are bracing for the new wave of as many as 200,000 more
refugees fleeing Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   These refugees, they fear, have seen even more violent episodes
and experienced more physical suffering. Many families have camped
out in snow-covered mountains hiding from Serb troops for as long
as two weeks. Medics are already seeing an increased caseload of
hypothermia, malnourishment, pneumonia, and diarrhea, says Dr.
Dieter Jacobi of the German Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   In an emergency medical tent at the camp, the tiny, wrinkled
faces of 3-month-old twins, Ghani and Garip Hysa, peered out of the
thick glass of an incubator. Their cries were muffled through the
glass, and the sound of a machine mechanically pumping oxygen into
the incubator was a steady rhythm in a pediatric medical full of
coughing and crying children. Severely malnourished and suffering
from pneumonia, the twins weigh 6 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so happy when they were born, and they were so
healthy,'' said their mother, Farizad, who was wrapped in blankets
and lying on a canvas stretcher next to them.
</P>
<P>
   She said they arrived in the camp Thursday night after two weeks
of hiding in the fierce cold and forbidding terrain of the
mountains. Like tens of thousands of refugees forming the second
wave out of Kosovo, she, her husband, their 3-year-old daughter,
and the infants were hemmed in between the mountains and the
Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   She said she could feel her children dying in her arms. The two
boys shivered in the cold and slowly drifted into deep sleep that
she feared was death, except she heard a faint wheezing in their
lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Alkan, a member of the Israeli army's medical corps
treating the twins, said, ``It is very touch and go. They are on
the edge of their lives. We pray we can keep them.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams of pediatricians, child psychologists, and teachers are
gathering here and in Albania to help children through the crisis.
The United Nations Children Fund is building schools and day care
centers to help bring some sense of normalcy and routine back into
young shattered lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is to engage them, to help them cope with their
distress by getting them to draw, play soccer, read books, and to
do, as much as possible, what normal children do,'' UNICEF
executive director Carol Bellamy said while touring camps in
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Rune Stuvland, a Norwegian child psychologist who set up a
UNICEF-funded program to assist the children of Bosnia, has seen
the devastating Balkan hatred and violence before. He is now
training counselors, social workers, and teachers from the Albanian
community to spot the signs of post-traumatic stress in children.
The obvious manifestations of trauma, he said, are insomnia,
depression, lack of attention, and withdrawal. In boys over age 12
there is also aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children live in a very small world,'' Stuvland said.
``Suddenly it has all been taken away: home, school, friends. They
are all gone now. So what we have here is a whole population that
has been traumatized by what's going on. The Albanian family
structure will help them a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But scores of children here and in Albania have lost even that.
A 5-year-old girl, Jehona Alieu, was found wandering the ``no man's
land'' between Yugoslavia and Macedonia two weeks ago. As of
Friday, her parents had not been found. Three elderly women from
the same village have taken her in, and in the late afternoon
Jehona was gleefully going back and forth on a swing that the women
had fashioned out of rope and a blanket at the entrance to the
tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have three grandmothers,'' Jehona said, giggling.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents are desperately searching for missing children.
Xhavit Cecielija and his wife were separated from their two sons,
ages 6 and 3, in the chaos of the border crossing into Macedonia on
April 1. Tired and with deep rings under their eyes, they spend
every day scanning lists, hoping to find their children's names.
They check the camp's bulletin board where handwritten notes
recount fractured stories of families torn apart. On Friday, news
trickled in that their sons were found in a camp a few miles away.
On Friday, they were working with the Red Cross to locate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope tomorrow we will see them. My God, I just want to see
them to know they are alive,'' said Cecielija. ``I am most worried
about the older one. He is a very sensitive child.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuvland said there is no precise treatment within child
psychology that can be applied to all these children. Much of
helping them heal, he said, just comes from love and understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents have healing power and often instinctively do the
right things,'' he said. ``We don't have a magic stick to make all
these bad things go away.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are practical ways to help, such as building
playgrounds and schools. On a grassy hill overlooking the canvas
tents in the Brazda refugee camp stood, as the children decided to
call it, ``The Kosovo Is Waiting for Us School.''
</P>
<P>
   The camp has become home to 20,000 refugees, 15,000 of whom are
estimated to be children. Friday was the first day of classes. Some
80 children fidgeted at rows of desks as UNICEF-supplied notebooks,
crayons, and paints were handed to them.
</P>
<P>
   Fatmir Elezi, 28, a math teacher who had fled Pristina, said,
``Children are so resilient. Look at them.''
</P>
<P>
   After the children had finally quieted down, students were
invited to speak. And Besnik Hajdini, 12, shot his hand into the
air. He stood at the front of the class and without notes began
reciting words that he later said he took from his own thoughts and
books in school.
</P>
<P>
   This is what he said in his native Albanian:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are people with bad souls who leave us to die.
</P>
<P>
   How can they have no souls, destroying our schools.
</P>
<P>
   The sun is not shining.
</P>
<P>
   Blood is covering legendary Drenica.
</P>
<P>
   But Kosovo, we will not let you close your doors.
</P>
<P>
   Have mercy on us, grant us freedom.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the reading, he stood with his arms straight by his side.
He said what he remembers most about his family's ordeal fleeing
their home in Ferizay was that his Serbian neighbors did not help
them.
</P>
<P>
   Dafina Sejdiu, 11, from Grabanica, was wearing shoes that were
too big and a red sweatshirt with smiling teddy bears that formed
the word ``Music.'' She ducked her head while children volunteered
to speak. But during the art period, she was very busy.
</P>
<P>
   Without looking up from her painting, she said, ``I miss my old
school. None of my friends are here. And I don't know what happened
to them.''
</P>
<P>
   With a new watercolor set, she painted flowers, trees, and a
warm yellow sun. The color of the sun blended nicely into the green
of the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my village, this is my house, and this is our
garden,'' she said. ``I want to paint all the things of Kosovo so I
don't forget.''

BEYOND KOSOVO: FLASHPOINTS IN A WIDER CONFLICT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ The events of this week heightened fears
that the crisis in Kosovo could burn beyond its borders and inflame
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, there were reports of an incursion into Albania by the
Serbian forces in a mountain village stronghold of the Kosovo
Liberation Army guerrillas. It was the first incident to raise the
spectre of a widening conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the steady flow of thousands more refugees crossing
into Macedonia refueled resentment against the ethnic Albanians
arriving by the busload. The Slav majority and Serb minority
whisper of war as their concerns of a ``greater Albania'' seemed,
to them, to be developing before their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   And Friday, Montenegro awoke to plumes of black smoke over the
capital after a night of NATO bombing. This deepened the divisions
in the smaller of the two Republics that make up what's left of
Yugoslavia and leave it dangerously poised on the edge of a coup or
a possible civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Travelling the perimeter of a burning Kosovo over the last three
weeks, the streets of bordering Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro
are crackling with tension. From the educated elite to plant
workers the same sentiment is expressed.
</P>
<P>
   At a cafe in the Montenegran capital of Podgorica, Ranko
Krivokapica, 32, a refined and Western-educated member of the
liberal party that supports the ``neutral'' Montenegran government,
watched one of the growing street rallies in support of Milosevic
gathering steam across the street. ``I think it is all going to go
out of control. I am afraid there is a momentum here that will
overtake us,'' he said as the crowd chanted their support of
overthrowing his government.
</P>
<P>
   In Macedonia, Slavic and Serbian workers at an asphalt plant
glared in hatred at busses packed with ethnic Albanian refugees
winding down the country road from the Kosovo border and into their
economically strapped and fledgling country.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do not belong here,'' said Zurin Petrovic, 38, the
manager of the plant. ``They want to take this land and make it
part of Albania. They have no place here and they should not think
they will stay here without a war.''
</P>
<P>
   A certain fatalism has set in here. It holds that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic has intentionally put in motion a
chain of disasters that could unfold in the smoldering aftermath of
the NATO airstrikes. ``He (Milosvic) seems to have had a master
list for creating hell, and unfortunately it all seems to be coming
true,'' said John Drewienkiewicz, chief of operations for the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's mission in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO forces see the potential for a spill-over effect of the
Kosovo crisis as precisely the reason why their mission is so
important. Jamie Shea, NATO spokesman in Brussels, was asked by
reporters last week if he thought Milosevic's ethnic cleansing of
some half million refugees was designed to ignite the Balkans and
threaten his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has always been one of Milosevic's intention . . . He has
threatened them directly, and one of the great achievmenets of the
alliance has been to prevent that (widening of the conflict) from
occuring.''
</P>
<P>
   There are three scenarios on three borders of Kosovo which
present the potential for a widening conflict. Based on interviews
with experts and officials in the region these are the scenarios in
order of their likelihood.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Albania, border skirmishes between Serbian forces and the
KLA along the border are considered likely to continue. An
estimated 200,000 refugees are believed hemmed in along the
border's snow peaked mountains having fled their burning villages
inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA has taken up a cat-and-mouse guerrilla war against the
Serbian forces, sniping at the troops at night in retaliation for
their ethnic cleansing campaign of burning and looting which is
carried out during the day. The KLA has also fought to open a
corridor, NATO officials say, to permit a stream of refugees to
pass into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Montenegro, tension on the streets of the capital Podgorica
is evident. Half the roughly 600,000 population of the republic is
loyal to Milosevic and the Yugoslavian Army, which is believed to
have roughly 12,000 troops stationed there. The other half is loyal
to the Western-leaning government in power there, which has
officially declared neutrality in the conflict and is backed by a
well-trained and heavily armed Montenegran police force of roughly
9,000. The Yugoslav army and the Montenegran police eye each other
on the streets of the tense capital.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders on both sides say a coup is possible, and could erupt in
a civil war. In the first week of the bombing, the two sides
represented in the parliament held a tense, but ultimately
conciliatory debate in which they agreed neither side wanted to see
an outbreak of fighting within the republic. Since then, the
rallies for the pro-Milosevic forces which support his Serbian
nationalist aspirations have been growing in numbers and anger. The
steady stream of ethnic Albanian refugees, now numbered at roughly
70,000, staying in the homes of families and friends, add to the
tension.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Macedonia, the refugees there are also stirring tensions
and threatening to upset a fragile demographic balance. A Slavic
majority is apprehensive about the influx of Albanian refugees in
their country. Already some 120,000 ethnic Albanians have descended
on Macedonia in refugee camps and in the homes of relatives and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   And now, as their numbers rise, the majority fear that the
ethnic Albanians and the supporters of the KLA desire a ``greater
Albania.'' Certainly, the Albanians' rhetoric to that effect has
heightened amid the chaos and confusion and despair of the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The government in Albania as recently as last week sought to
assure its neighbors that they do not desire to extend their
borders. But Albania, the poorest country in Europe with a Gross
National Product less than half the worth of one B-2 bomber, is
suffering under the strain of the influx of some 300,000 refugees.
Some say it could face economic collapse and political unrest if it
does not receive massive aid from Western countries.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts consider a conflict for a ``greater Albania'' a
relatively remote possibility, but its ramifications would be
enormous, splintering the vaneer of states and boundaries across
this least-developed corner of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility cuts along the fault line of the southern
Balkans. On one side are Orthodox Christian groups in charge of
Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia and Greece. On the other side are
Muslim Albanian-speaking minorities in all three countries which
have a Muslim protectorate in Turkey. This raises the worst case
scenario of a conflict that would ultimately pit Greece and Turkey
_ two North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies and historic
enemies _ against each other.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat, who asked not to be named, said these kinds
of fears were understandable, but unfounded. He said Milosevic
would like the region to unravel, but that NATO has for the first
time in 50 years attacked a sovereign nation to prevent that from
happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had left Slobodan (Milosevic) to his own devices in
Kosovo it would have unraveled,'' he said. ``I don't believe in the
prophecy that it (a wider conflict) is inevitable. I just believe
we have to do everything we can to stop it.''

ALBANIANS EAGERLY GREET US PRESENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ Once, armed guards at Tirana's sleepy airport
spent the day in a crumbling barracks, disturbed by as few as three
flights before the airstrip closed for the night.
</P>
<P>
   Rusted Soviet planes lay scattered in the field, left over from
the country's communist days. Concrete bunkers lined the road,
symbols of the paranoia that gripped the land.
</P>
<P>
   But with the NATO bombings of Yugoslavia, those quiet days have
vanished, along with the last remnants of the old Albania that once
defined the airstrip.
</P>
<P>
   Some 30 American air traffic controllers now run the guard
tower. Hundreds of green US military tents line the fields. A
20-foot radar dish juts out from the horizon, and even the dirt is
covered with gravel, ready for thousands of foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Tirana airport is, by all accounts, a sign of what could be
called the ``USS Albania'' phenomenon, the transformation of this
small country into a giant military headquarters for the United
States and NATO as they escalate the airstrikes on neighboring
Yugoslavia. And yet the most startling part of the occupation of
Albania might be the enthusiasm of Albanians themselves, as a
nation that once surpassed the Soviet Union in its hatred of the
West welcomes the invasion by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Becoming America's 51st state would be a great thing for us,''
said Ylli Vejsiu, a member of Albania's parliament, without a trace
of irony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to belong in the rest of the world,'' said another
member of parliament, Jonuy Begaj. ``Our territory is at their
disposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Albania has ceded control of its airspace, ports and
roads to US and NATO leaders. Hotels in the capital are jammed with
foreign dignitaries, humanitarian aid officials and journalists.
Convoys of Land Rovers with foreign plates race up and down the
roadways, and helicopter traffic is so overwhelming that police are
worried about the rising rate of car crashes, as local drivers lean
out their windows to point at the sky.
</P>
<P>
   A massive foreign presence is expected in a crisis such as this.
But even by modern standards, the overtaking of Albania seems
unusual, with every corner of the nation's 11,000 square miles
playing host to citizens from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In the north, foreign aid officials have overwhelmed the town of
Kukes, renting office and hotel space in residents' living rooms
because of the lack of hotels. So many relief workers now stream
through the western port of Durres that the line for customs can
last days. Some 8,000 NATO troops are on their way to Tirana to
carry out the humanitarian effort, and NATO's commander, General
Wesley Clark, has described the capital as ``one of the hubs of our
activity.'' During a visit Saturday, Clark predicted the airport
would become ``one of the busiest spots in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the concentrated presence is obvious: Of the
nations bordering Kosovo, only Albania is in a position to oppose
Serbia loudly. Macedonia, an ethnically mixed state, still has ties
to Serbia, and Montenegro still coexists within the Yugoslav
federation, so it is in no position to open its doors to outside
troops, even if it wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   Only Albania, home to dozens of training camps of the Kosovo
Liberation Army and now, 300,000 ethnic Albanian refugees, can
encourage NATO ground troops as it has in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the political metamorphosis of this tiny nation is
almost incomprehensible to many of its citizens, who spent decades
learning to despise the West. Until the fall of communism in 1991,
they lived in what was considered the most xenophobic country in
Europe, a place so dogmatic that it once cut diplomatic ties with
the Soviet Union because it had become too liberal, and later cut
off relations with China for embracing capitalism too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would never have been imaginable 15 years ago,'' said
Vejsui. ``The US was viewed as the representative of imperialism,
and under communism, the government would do anything to keep the
US out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even two years ago, a massive foreign presence would have been
unthinkable, as a network of government-endorsed pyramid schemes
collapsed, sparking riots and ruining the economy. Since then,
Albania has struggled to find its place in Europe under a new
administration. But only now, as the rest of the Balkans teeters on
the edge of chaos, and as Serb troops shell the northern border, do
Albanian officials believe the country has a chance to flourish.
Hysen Selfo, a leader of the National Democratic Party, said he has
already seen ``a big symbolic change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the airport looking like this, my first thought
was, `Albania still has friends,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is clearly mutual, at least among the dozens of
dignitaries who have paraded through Tirana over the last week. As
Clark met with Albanian leaders Saturday, expressing NATO's
gratitude for their cooperation and promising to help defend the
northern border, a delegation of US senators flew into town to talk
to American troops, and a delegation from Greece held meetings
throughout the capital. The Tirana Airport proved so busy that
Elizabeth Dole, the former head for the American Red Cross and a
potential candidate for president, was turned away when she tried
to fly in.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as 24 Apache helicopters prepare to make Albania their home
base for attacks on Kosovo, civilians and officials alike are doing
everything they can to open the borders further. Albanian officials
say they are ready for ground troops, and have already authorized
the placement of NATO fuel tanks throughout the north. Albanian
soldiers have willingly taken a back seat throughout the country,
with orders to defer to NATO and US leaders if the need arrises.
Even a bumper sticker is making the rounds, showing the peace sign
against a backdrop of the US flag.

   ROYCOM (Kansas City, Mo.) _ How does the name Kauffman Stadium
at Sprint Park grab you?
</P>
<P>
   Miles Prentice is exploring the many commercial possibilities
that go hand-in-hand with being the Royals owner. Prentice, who is
still seeking ownership approval by Major League Baseball, says
he's already discussed the idea of selling Kauffman Stadium naming
rights to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, where would that money go _ to Prentice and the
Royals or to Jackson County? That's unclear for now, but at the
very least, Prentice plans to increase billboard advertising at the
stadium. Both dugouts, outfield walls and other areas within the
complex could all become marketing tools and sources of new
revenue. Story by Steve Rock. (Sports desk) Story will move in the

WHY ARE SPRING PEEPERS SO LOUD? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I heard an incredible chorus from a swampy area in the
Middlesex Fells at dusk, enough to make your ears ring. It went on
for hours. Was it tree frogs, or crickets, and why were they making
so much noise?
</P>
<P>
   J., Medford, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You probably heard frogs, probably males calling out their
version of: ``Hey Baby, what's your sign?'' They were trying to
attract a mate and it is hoped that frog croaking is more
persuasive than ``Hey Baby, what's your sign?''
</P>
<P>
   The first few weeks of April are prime time for the guttural
quack-like honk of the wood frog. Matt Burne is a herpetologist
with MassWildlife, the state agency that tries to manage a healthy
peaceful relationship between wildlife and humans. Burne says wood
frogs only breed in vernal pools, the temporary ponds that form in
low-lying areas in the early spring. Which means they have to get
their croaking and mating done in a hurry, since vernal pools dry
up by summer.
</P>
<P>
   They usually croak only under the protection of darkness.
Croaking draws more than female frogs. It also draws hungry
predators looking for unfried frogs legs. At the peak of the wood
frogs' breeding season, the biological imperative to reproduce
overpowers their instinct for self preservation and they croak all
day.
</P>
<P>
   But Burne says you probably heard a frog duet, trio, or maybe
even an amphibian quartet. Spring peepers, who make that sweet high
little ``Peep. Peep,'' are also singing their mating song this time
of year, in a wide variety of wetlands habitats, not just vernal
pools. They're also sometimes known onomatopoetically for their
sound as ``pinkletinks.'' Their habitat flexibility lets them breed
throughout the spring and summer, and you can hear their peeps,
mostly at dusk and overnight, well into August.
</P>
<P>
   You might also have been hearing the high trills of the American
toad, or the Fowler's toad. (Toads are the ones with the bumpy
skin. Frogs have smooth skin.) Those two toad species are also
singing out their best ``Hey Baby'' this time of year, through late
May, in a variety of wetlands habitats.
</P>
<P>
   And if you have a good ear for low notes, you might have heard
the bass player of the amphibian quartet, the leopard frog, which
sings from underwater, an ingenious protection from predation.
Burne describes their call as ``like snoring, low and hard to
hear.''
</P>
<P>
   As the wood frog fades out in May, the pretty, rising
``twrrrRRRR'' of the grey tree frog (it sounds like a raccoon, for
those of you who may know what raccoons sound like) takes its place
for most of May. Green frogs (a low-pitched twang) and the pickerel
frog (a faint low ``grrrr-grrrr'') add their romancing ``ribbets''
in late May and sing until the end of July. Bull frogs, with their
gruff low ``rrrrrRRRR, rrrrrrRRRR'' sing all summer.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear what attracts female amphibians to the particular
prince of their choice. One study suggests it may be that the
frog/toad that calls longest, wins. It takes a lot of energy for
amphibians to inflate their air sacs (most are under the chin...the
wood frog has one on either side of its body) and expel the air.
The longer a frog/toad can keep calling, the more fit he may be,
and the more attractive to females who evolved to pick a mate with
good genes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The buzzing sound you hear at night in meadows I always
thought was crickets. Someone told me it's tree frogs. What is it?
</P>
<P>
   B.S. Somerville, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Jeepers. Creepers. Can't you hear those Peepers? And those
cicadas, and crickets and grasshoppers and katydids, the major
insects that add their voices to the outdoor chorus of spring and
summer nights.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Simmons, Entymologist with the state's Natural Heritage and
Endangered Species Program, says the same basic rules apply to bugs
that apply to frogs and toads. The guys do the calling, looking for
mates. They call at night to get lucky, not devoured.
</P>
<P>
   Crickets wait until they're fully grown to rub the spines of
their legs on their wings and make their chirping sound. Big
crickets eat little ones. A young cricket doesn't want a
prospective mate to come over and turn him into a meal. That's why
cricket chirping grows near the end of summer, as more of them grow
big enough to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Katydids, also named for their sound, are, like crickets. They
call from summer to fall. Grasshoppers, which produce their sound
in the same way, have evolved to call mostly during the day,
probably because they're down in the grass and camouflaged, not up
in bushes or trees and vulnerable to birds. They also call in
flight by rattling their wings.
</P>
<P>
   Cicadas, which we sometimes call locusts, have a special
sound-producing organ in their abdomen that's filled with air,
which vibrates when they want to buzz their best ``Hey Baby.''

DUNCAN PLAYS ROXIE `FROM THE INSIDE OUT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- ``You're just a little too much in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sandy Duncan's 16-year-old son Jeffrey mentioned this, more
off-handedly than unkindly, to what was then his full-time mother,
she recalled a therapist's reaction in a discussion they'd had
about the Manhattan-based Duncan returning to the stage again. The
therapist said that work may help when you're the mother of two
teenage boys _ Duncan's other son, Michael, is 15 _ because you can
expect that no matter what ``you'll be blamed for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   So Jeffrey's observation struck theater and TV star Duncan, 53,
almost as a cue. She took it that way. Which is why she's coming to
Boston as the vivacious bombshell Roxie Hart, a hoofer turned
killer, in Kander &AMP; Ebb's winner of six Tony Awards, ``Chicago _
The Musical. '' The rest of the family will stay in at home in New
York while the show has its second Boston run Thursday through May
16 at the Shubert Theatre. It played a sold-out engagement at the
Colonial last December through mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   The show, a new incarnation of the legendary Bob Fosse's gritty
mid-'70s musical, is set in the garishly violent Chicago of the
Roaring '20s. Also along for the ride on this brassy vehicle is
Ruthie Henshall, who originated the role of Roxie in the London
production. She's now playing the ``venemous vixen'' Velma Kelly.
Adrian Zmed, Danny Zuko in the Broadway and national tour of
``Grease,'' is the scheming, media-savvy attorney, Billy Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Duncan said an almost genetic determination is
the key to her survival as both a performer and the mother of
teenage boys _ she and her dancer/husband Don Correia have been
married for 20 years. That determination, she added, is not unlike
that of her character Roxie Hart who, Duncan says, she plays from
``the inside out.'' Here's the back story Duncan has created for
her character:
</P>
<P>
   ``Roxie will do anything to get what she wants, but she won't
kill. Yes, she killed a person, but she's just an innocent. There's
a little bit of Roxie in all of us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roxie is ``not evil or bad, she's just a bit of a teenager,''
Duncan says. ``She thinks, `This is what I want' and goes after it.
She's also a quick study. She's the kind of person who, when she
gets sentenced to prison, quickly gets into prison work. She's
complex. You can't read her like a book. She killed a person, but
she's still just an innocent. There are a lot of people like that
out there. She's been abandoned by people around her all her life.
Her father committed suicide. She's always had people leaving
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, born and raised in Texas, had a very successful New York
stage career, finally getting her big break in the Broadway musical
``Canterbury Tales,'' for which she received her first Tony Award
nomination in 1969. Her second Tony nomination was for her starring
role in 1971's ``The Boyfriend,'' for which she received the New
York Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle awards. She also earned a
nomination for her starring role in ``Peter Pan.'' She appeared in
Tommy Tune's award-winning production of ``My One and Only'' and
starred opposite Tune in national and international tours of the
musical.
</P>
<P>
   She had her own TV comedy series ``Funny Face'' for which she
was Emmy nominated for the 1971-72 season. The series came to a
screeching halt after 13 episodes when Duncan learned that she had
a brain tumor resting on an optic nerve.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, she told a reporter in an interview, she thought
she was going mad. ``I was working until 3 every morning, only
getting three hours of sleep a night, and I weighed 86 pounds . .
.I started fantasizing that I was in an insane asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   The brain tumor was benign, it turned out, but 10 hours of
surgery at the UCLA Medical Center in California failed to prevent
the loss of sight in her left eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine,'' she says today. ``CAT scans became available a
year after my surgery. With a CAT scan, I wouldn't have lost an
eye. It shows you what a difference progress makes. With time, I
learned how to survive. In fact, I have some of Roxie's qualities.
I couldn't wallow in self pity. What I've found is that there are
times when a lot of denial works. People were around me telling me
not to deny that my career was over. That notion never entered my
mind. My good eye, the right one, is fine, although I'm
nearsighted. I don't wear contacts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to compensate for depth perception. I do symphonies
around the country. I block all my movements out beforehand. I have
my own radar. The audience helps me a lot. I have a general feel
for audiences, for an audience's range of responses to things. It's
not something you see. You feel it.''

TOD MACHOVER TOOK A LONG ROAD IN CREATING AN OPERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two big new American operas this year _ Tod Machover's
``Resurrection,'' which opens next week at the Houston Grand Opera,
and John Harbison's ``The Great Gatsby,'' which will have its
premiere at the Metropolitan Opera in the fall. It says something
for the density and quality of our musical life that both composers
live here _ and both teach at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Machover's opera his been in the works since 1988, when
Houston's general manager, David Gockley, saw the premiere of
Machover's first opera, ``Valis,'' in the Pompidou Center in Paris.
``Valis,'' based on a science-fiction novel by Philip K. Dick,
boasts a high-tech, musically advanced but rock-related score that
reached a young and hip audience in a way no American opera had in
years. Gockley wanted Machover's next opera. It took him more than
10 years to get it.

   Machover is 45, but he talks with the unbounded yet focused
energy that must have made him the extraordinary teenager he still
physically resembles. The route toward ``Resurrection'' turned out
to have many swerves and detours. Over lunch in Harvard Square
recently, the composer explained some of how it went.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally this was going to be a joint project with the stage
director Peter Sellars,'' Machover explained. `` `Valis' was very
much a story that saw the world through one person's mind, an
internal drama. I wanted my next narrative project to go in a
different direction, to show how the mind can get out of itself,
and make a difference in the world around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Machover and Sellars considered several subjects, including
Honore de Balzac's novel ``La Peau de Chagrin.'' An original
libretto was commissioned on a 20th-century subject, the
experiences of two families in Dallas before and after the Kennedy
assassination, ``how an unbounded but unrealistic optimism was
shattered and turned the opposite way and the movement toward a
realistic sense of what is achievable,''Machover says. The composer
found the completed libretto dark and strong, but the consensus was
that the text was ``way too real,'' and that it might be better to
look for something else. Thinking back to the Balzac idea, Machover
again began to think about the vivid characters and powerful themes
of the major 19th-century novels _ George Eliot's ``Daniel
Deronda'' was a possibility for a while. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A big Tolstoy period &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I`ve always been a big novel reader,'' Machover says. ``In my
late high school and early college years, I went through a big
Tolstoy period. Both sets of my grandparents came from Russia, so
Tolstoy was my favorite; there was a copy of his last novel,
`Resurrection,' on my shelves.'' Machover's attention was directed
back to ``Resurrection'' by a book by David Remnick (now the editor
of The New Yorker).
</P>
<P>
   By then, Sellars was out of the picture, but Gockley suggested a
librettist who had done some earlier work for Houston Opera, Laura
Harrington, who conveniently lives in Gloucester _ and, even more
conveniently, turns out to teach at MIT, although the two had never
met there.
</P>
<P>
   As Harrington worked on a scenario, Machover and Gockley were on
the lookout for a director. ``For a while we were looking for
someone young, and Russian, but then at the suggestion of the
conductor Kent Nagano, we met with Braham Murray, the artistic
director of the Royal Exchange Theater in Manchester, England. It
was clear from our first meeting that Braham would be ideal for
this opera, so he joined the team. All of us met on the Big Sur, in
California, and firmed up all the details.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Resurrection'' tells the story of an aristocrat, Prince
Nekhlyudov, who is summoned to serve on the jury for a murder
trial. One of the accused is a prostitute, Maslova. Nekhlyudov
recognizes her as a young girl he once seduced and abandoned.
Maslova is carelessly convicted by the jury and sent to Siberia;
Nekhlyudov follows her there, and both find their own way to
salvation.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Resurrection' is a vast novel,'' says Machover, ``and nature
is one of the major characters. Braham emphasized how important it
was to concentrate on Maslova and Nekhlyudov, on their meetings,
and on what happens to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Machover wrote the music between January 1998 and February 1999,
most of it on the Big Sur while he was on a leave of absence from
MIT. ``We arrived three weeks before El Nino knocked out all the
roads around the house, so our time there turned out to be more of
a retreat than we expected.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A demo CD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the California meetings with Harrington and Murray, ``it
was up to me,'' Machover says. Murray had emphasized how important
the sound of the music would be to the designers, so Machover
departed from his usual routine, took five key episodes, and wrote
the music for them first, putting it onto a little 15-minute demo
CD. ``This is what got me started,'' Machover says.
</P>
<P>
   By then, a cast was in place.Machover had decided he wanted a
young, attractive, and talented cast, not necessarily a lineup of
famous singers. The choice for Maslova fell on mezzo-soprano Joyce
Didonato, a graduate of the Houston Opera Studio _ ``she is
fantastic and very smart'' _ and the sound of her voice was in
Machover's ear as he composed. The baritone selected for Nekhlyudov
proved to be the wrong choice once rehearsals began. ``But we were
incredibly lucky,'' Machover says, ``because the understudy, Scott
Hendricks, was everything we were looking for in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Resurrection'' is a big opera, 2 1/2 hours of music. Because
Machover is associated with the avant-garde, Houston's initial
publicity concentrated on how traditional the opera is. Machover's
many admirers know better than to assume he would write anything
merely conventional _ after all, there's already a conventional
opera based on ``Resurrection'' by the Italian composer Franco
Alfano, who is best known for completing ``Turandot'' after
Puccini's death.
</P>
<P>
   Machover does admit that ``Resurrection'' is a ``number opera''
with arias, duets, choruses, etc., ``but the structures are larger
than the individual numbers, as they are in the operas of Mozart
and Tchaikovsky; the music really does move from one end to the
other. The second act does bring big transformations in the story
and in the music. At this point, the characters have lost
`everything,' but it is at that very moment that they express their
human warmth and begin to make connections; as they are dehumanized
by everything around them, they become human again. For me, one of
the big challenges was to find something in the music that would
sweep you through all the dialogue, but also make each turn of
events and feelings sink in, and become consequential. There are
many mini-numbers in the opera, but the little sections build into
bigger ones. The music mutates and evolves.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Checking other operas &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Machover says he has known and loved the major Mozart operas all
his life. ``But I looked at `The Marriage of Figaro' and `Cosi fan
tutte'' again before setting to work, to see how Mozart made
psychological and dramatic points as elegantly as he did, and how
he built his finales into overall shapes. And I listened to a lot
of Russian operas, `Boris Godunov,' `Eugen Onegin,' `The Queen of
Spades,' and `War and Peace,' as well as to Janacek's `From the
House of the Dead.' I also found myself listening to a lot of
Scriabin's piano music, to some of Tchaikovsky's music, and to some
early Shostakovich _ not to imitate it, but to see how it works. I
think the melodies in the opera, the emotional directness, the
strong bass line, the energy, the adventure, all owe something to
these examples. Russian music had its own progression from
Tchaikovsky to Scriabin to Stravinsky that was very different from
the progression in French and German music we are are familiar
with. My bedside reading during this period was Richard Taruskin's
huge volumes on the Russian Stravinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Machover's own view is that ``Resurrection'' sounds like his own
music, ``the same, only different.'' There is an electronic element
running through the whole piece, generated by three keyboards; one
reason for this is to define, clarify, and emphasize the bass line,
but it is also there to shadow melody, and color and refine
textures. ``I like acoustic sound better than the sound that comes
out of loudspeakers, which is not three-dimensional and lacks
roundness and presence. This score is a blend, and attempts to take
the best of both worlds. The electronics have to be performed like
everything else in the score; I hate anything that's merely
mechanical. The orchestra, singers, and chorus will not be
amplified.''
</P>
<P>
   Machover is fascinated by the way a major opera house works. It
is also a new experience to turn so much of the work over to other
people. ``David has been a real producer. `Valis' was essentially
built on the model of a rock group, which can rehearse all day in a
garage. This is something else _ an ocean liner, not a sports
car.''
</P>
<P>
   Machover has enjoyed the process so much he's already planning
another opera, with a libretto by novelist Leslie Epstein about the
life of composer Arnold Schoenberg in Hollywood; the subject is the
clash and coexistence of serious and popular culture. Meanwhile,
he's at work on a special project for children he is calling the
``Toy Symphony.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For this I will invent some new musical instruments, so that
kids can play with sounds the way they can play with colors and
other things. I'm working with the toy companies on this because
they have proved far more receptive to the idea than the music
companies. The plan is to involve the orchestras of 10 cities, and
100 kids will end up playing their instruments alongside the 100
members of each orchestra. We haven't approached the Boston
Symphony yet, but we certainly hope they'd be interested.''

<P>
   (FU)  &UR; !! &LR;  ``Goodbye Lover'' This film never becomes the dark,
edgy, eccentric criminal comedy it sets out to be, with its
schemers on parade and treachery everywhere in an LA powered by
greed and driven by lust. The plot twists, initially intriging,
pile up so furiously that the film becomes weightless, then silly,
wasting Patricia Arquette's amoral vamp, Don Johnson's immoral
lothario and Ellen DeGeneres's world-weary, gimlet-eyed cop. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FD)  &UR; ! &LR;  1/2 ``Life'' Eddie Murphy continues his free-fall from
comedic grace in this bland buddy film that spans 60 years in the
lives of Ray (Murphy), a small-time hustler, and Claude (Martin
Lawrence), an aspiring bank teller, who are wrongfully imprisoned
for murder. Straining for a poignant blend of humor and humanity _
and falling far short of both _ with recycled jail-cell jokes and
ditch-digging scenes from a Southern plantation-prison, ``Life''
makes you wish Murphy would get back in touch with his inner
wiseguy, and leave the dramedy to De Niro. (R) (Joan Anderman) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! &LR;  ``The School of Flesh'' Benoit Jacquot's film not only leads
its older woman (Isabelle Huppert) and younger man (Vincent
Martinez) into love, but leads them out again, or, rather, allows
them to emerge intact after their affair runs its course in this
humane look at amour fou in a film that for once doesn't punish the
older woman. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !! &LR;  ``Tax Day'' Laura Colella's noodling little film about two
Providence women bound for the post office on April 15, is less
concerned with plot (there isn't one) than with highlighting the
city, its residents, and the extraordinary moments primed to the
plucked from the everyday. (Unrated) (Renee Graham)

REVISITING PEYTON PLACE'S `FORBIDDEN' FRUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Ardis Cameron wanted to use the once-notorious, now dimly
remembered ``Peyton Place'' in the course she teaches on New
England culture, she had to ``scour the local libraries'' to find
enough copies for her students.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years since it was first published in 1956, Grace
Metalious's novel had sold 12 million copies, but it had long been
out of print.
</P>
<P>
   So Cameron, director of American and New England Studies at the
University of Southern Maine, went to Northeastern University Press
with a proposal to reprint the book _ with an introduction by
Cameron putting the novel in its social and cultural context.
</P>
<P>
   That new edition is being published this month. It is a coup of
sorts for the small university press, as trade giant
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster, which had published the most recent edition,
10 years ago, had been planning to bring it out again as part of
its own 75th anniversary _ not knowing that Northeastern had
secured the rights.
</P>
<P>
   With bookstores now overstocked with novels hyped as
``shocking'' or ``explosive,'' ``erotic'' or ``sensuous,'' it may
be hard to imagine the impact ``Peyton Place'' had more than 40
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of passions and problems in a small town, written by an
unknown young author from New Hampshire, sold 60,000 copies in the
first 10 days (at $3.95) _ to the outraged indignation of
self-appointed defenders of public decency.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Manchester (N.H.) Union-Leader editor William Loeb
wrote that the book revealed ``a complete debasement of taste and a
fascination with the filthy, rotten side of life that are the
earmarks of the collapse of civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend recalled for Cameron how she once heard her mother and
a friend ``whispering in the kitchen. As soon as I entered, they
whipped a book into a bag, but they were too slow. I had caught my
mother reading `Peyton Place,' a book banned in our town library.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron herself was only 7 when ``Peyton Place'' was published,
but she remembers the lingering aura of forbidden pleasure that
continued as the book became a motion picture and then a television
serial in the mid-1960s. ``My first memory of it is coming home and
seeing my parents watching it,'' she said. ``They wouldn't let us
into the study while it was on.''
</P>
<P>
   What the uproar was all about was a novel about a small town
that was on the surface, as Metalious put it, ``as peaceful as a
postcard picture,'' but where ``if you go beneath that picture it's
like turning over a rock with your foot. All sorts of things crawl
out'' _ abuse and incest, alcholism and poverty, the shacks of the
region's backroads and, perhaps most shocking in 1956, abortion.
</P>
<P>
   As Cameron writes, Metalious had ``tweaked the mythologies of
tourist New England, turning the familiar postcard portrait into a
voluptuous pinup poster.'' Ironically, when Hollywood filmed
``Peyton Place,'' it was not in the backwoods New Hampshire town
Metalious had envisioned but in the picture-postcard coastal town
of Camden, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Metalious apparently drew on several New Hampshire communities
to create her fictional town. The fact that a murder similar to the
one she describes _ a young woman killing her abusive father and
hiding his body _ had occurred in nearby Gilmanton Ironworks just
10 years before, raised local suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Metalious, who lived in Gilmanton, wasn't exactly run out of
town _ she actually bought an antique colonial there with the
proceeds from the book, but her then-husband lost his job as a
grammar school principal there. Metalious had grown up in poverty
and, she once commented, ``I think I began writing `Peyton Place'
the day I was born.'' She died in 1964, with her personal and
financial affairs in disorder.
</P>
<P>
   But, writes Cameron, she had ``unbuttoned New England.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that unbuttoning that prompted Cameron to use ``Peyton
Place'' in her course, which studies how representations of New
England have been created. Along with Metalious's novel, she has
also used books as varied as Sarah Orne Jewett's ``The Country of
the Pointed Firs,'' E. B. White's ``One Man's Meat,'' and Carolyn
Chute's ``The Beans of Egypt, Maine.'' ``I wanted to look at the
notions of New England, the eroticized landscape and the smugness
of New England towns which Metalious was trying to refute,''
Cameron said.

IN THE FACE OF CHANGE, A POP MUSIC CONFERENCE BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Aspiring rock bands and industry insiders will
converge on Boston next weekend, when the third annual NEMO Music
Showcase and Conference rolls into town. There will, as usual, be
much music-making and demo-tape delivering. We can expect the
familiar dialogues about the role of managers, creating a band
image, getting noticed by the critics. But this year's New England
Music Organization event will also bear the mark of radical,
tumultuous change, coming as it does in the midst of massive
upheaval in the music industry.
</P>
<P>
   Artists and executives are being slashed from record company
rosters like so much deadwood, thanks to the Seagram's Co.'s
gobbling of Polygram Holdings Inc. At least 500 employees and 250
acts have been dropped so far in the biggest corporate
restructuring in the history of the music industry. The rapid
growth of technology _ most prominently MP3, which allows
CD-quality recordings to be downloaded, often free of charge, from
Internet sites _ is wreaking havoc on established modes of music
distribution and financial compensation. The current mood could be
measured at the recent South by Southwest conference (SXSW) in
Austin _ the Big Kahuna of music conventions _ where the usual
throngs of A&AMP;R (artists and repertoire) scouts from major labels
were conspicuously thin, top executives were all but nonexistent,
and typically lavish spending on parties and promotion was scaled
back dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   All of this might be construed as bad news for Boston's
fledgling music conference, established in 1997 by Boston Music
Awards founder and executive director Candace Avery. NEMO lacks the
cachet and clout of behemoth industry cavalcades like SXSW and the
CMJ festival in New York, and one could argue that if the gloomy
business climate is keeping the brass from turning out for the main
events, the upstart in Beantown doesn't stand a chance. But it's
precisely NEMO's relative youth, and corresponding attitude, that
helps to distinguish it from well-established relations.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the sense of chaos and low spirits inspired by
recent events in the music business, Boston is still considered a
hotbed _ not only for breeding new music, but as a key location for
breaking new acts. There are more than 200,000 college students _
who comprise the core modern rock demographic _ in the Boston area.
That statistic is hardly lost on the labels' marketing departments.
Neither is the fact that those students will be fanning out to
every corner of the country during school vacations _ with their
favorite new CDs in tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labels look to establish bands here because we're very
receptive to new music,'' says Oedipus, program director at
WBCN-FM, one of NEMO's sponsors. ``There's a lot of attention at
the NEMO showcases.'' Even in the current shrinking industry,
Oedipus says, ``the labels are always looking for the next big
thing. There are labels who are just waiting for bands to be
dropped so that they can scoop them up. Yes, it makes it
competitive for the new bands. But what else is there?''
</P>
<P>
   SXSW, once the cultural barometer for the cutting edge and
ground zero for the best unsigned bands, has over the years become
largely a showcase vehicle for signed artists and a high-profile
shmoozefest. While Avery says that she used SXSW as her model while
conceiving NEMO, one key difference is that more than 90 percent of
the 200 bands (selected from 1,000 submissions) playing showcases
at area clubs during the NEMO gathering are still unsigned. Fifty
panels and workshops are all geared toward educating and empowering
emerging artists, with topics like National Touring for the
Underground Band, Marketing on the Internet, and individual
mentoring sessions with the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do those peripheral panels on Sex and Drugs and Rock
'N Roll or Women in Rock,'' says Avery. ``Mine are very
informational.'' And in a unique display of integrity, NEMO is the
only music convention in the country to give showcasing artists
free admission to the two-day conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I stress over and over to bands,'' says Avery, ``is
that while it's important to showcase, it's equally important to go
to the conference, to learn to oversee business, to network, to
promote the showcase. They're not getting paid to play, so this is
like their payment. A&AMP;R people from just about every label are here
doing mentoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Avery's well-intentioned appeals, some showcasing
artists are inclined to concentrate their time and energy on making
music at NEMO. Suzanne Wyllie, an Australian who gave up a thriving
jazz career Down Under to pursue fame as a folk-pop
singer-songwriter in the States, will be at Club Passim Friday.
She's currently in the studio with Eric Rosse, who has produced
tracks for Tori Amos, among others. ``The chaos in the business
does concern me. It's harder to be heard. And for a new artist,
trying to do something a little different and unique, I think it's
even harder. But I'm going to send my manager to the conference;
it's too frightening for me. I'm hoping to expose my music, to
start cultivating an audience in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Pulling Birds, a 2-year-old modern rock band from Clearwater,
Fla., rented a van and booked club dates up and down the coast to
finance the trip to NEMO. Armed with a self-produced CD, ``County
Fair'' (recorded in lead singer Wade McMullen's parents' bedroom)
and a glowing notice in Billboard, Pulling Birds will play a
showcase at Bill's Bar on Saturday. According to McMullen--at 22,
the band's oldest member--Pulling Birds is also planning to pack
its manager off to network on the band's behalf. ``Yeah, I think
the odds are off now. But a band as young as we are, we're not
really thinking about that right now. We're concentrating on
writing songs.'' And while McMullen acknowledges that his band's
youth is an advantage in today's market, he's savvy enough to know
that ``some industry people think we should just develop for
free.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet no one would deny that clinching a record deal is the holy
grail. While Avery is reticent to take credit for any signing that
results from a NEMO showcase, last year's conference did produce
one extraordinary success story in the pop group My Favorite
Relative. The band, formed by Swiss expatriates Adrian Hierholzer
and Kurt Uenala, played their first live gig ever at a showcase at
the Hard Rock Cafe. After hearing the band's homemade tape at the
NEMO Demo Derby, WBCN's Juanita, also a scout for MCA records,
passed the tape to the label, which resulted in a demo deal for the
band. High-powered entertainment lawyer Peter Paterno (Metallica,
Smashing Pumpkins) came calling, as did a handful of interested
record labels. No deal has officially been inked _ mainly because
three of the A&AMP;R reps courting the band lost their jobs in the
Universal-Polygram merger. But the band, who is nominated for six
Boston Music Awards this year and plays at Bill's Bar Friday night,
is cautiously optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is sure now. It's probably the worst time to get
signed,'' Hierholzer says. ``But we have a lot of good songs, and
we are patient.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, one has to wonder if the recent sales slump and
industry downsizing will impact the typically enthusiastic scouting
that characterizes the conferences. In recent years, Fastball, Lisa
Loeb, Cake, and Hanson all set deals in motion at SXSW. This year,
one A&AMP;R rep admitted he went to SXSW expressly to prevent his label
from signing a band.
</P>
<P>
   Avery concedes that ``the industry is somewhat circumspect. Like
any industry, this one is cyclical. But it's not dead, or going
away. I think a lot of indie labels will be stepping in and signing
now. I do think there's a hunger for alternative methods of getting
music heard and making contacts. The industry has changed so much,
especially in the last year. The internet is having a major impact.
Two years ago, .3 percent of music was sold on the internet; last
year 1.1 percent was sold online. I mean, it's in its infancy, but
that's a significant increase. And MP3...that will change the
industry radically.''
</P>
<P>
   NEMO's response to the trends in the industry is a point of
pride for Avery. New panels created this year include Technologies
of Change: The Internet, MP3 and More; Artist Development at an
Indie Label; Examining the Success of Indie Hip-Hop; and
Establishing a Scene that Supports Urban Culture. There will also
be two nights of rap and hip-hop showcases, in an effort to shed
light on a genre which--while the hottest thing going in mainstream
popular music--has been woefully neglected in the Boston area.
``There's lots of talent; there are just no venues,'' Avery says.
``The hip-hop community here hasn't been very cohesive and focused.
And Boston's history as a segregated city exasperates that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Stephens, vice president of A&AMP;R at Atlantic Records, is
coming to NEMO from one of the few labels not affected by the
plethora of mergers. Stephens, who signed Matchbox 20, Collective
Soul, and Edwin McCain to Atlantic, plans to attend a number of
showcases in addition to participating in a panel, Major Label A&AMP;R:
Are You Ready For It?.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about the others, but my company is still looking
for talent,'' Stephens states emphatically. ``I came across a
couple of bands (he declined to name them) last year that I thought
showed promise, and I'll definitely check them out again this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   NEMO, while still considered the new kid on the block, is
growing steadily. In its first there were 850 registrants; last
year there were 1,200, and this year Avery is expecting about
1,500. That doesn't compare to the 6,800 who streamed into SXSW
last month. But at this time of great flux in the music industry,
poised on the edge of a new millennium, size does matter. There's
value in a small conference _ one that may not pack the glamor or
attract the attention of its heftier counterparts, but gets back to
the basics of making new music.

CANADA STILL BEARS IMPRINT OF REVOLUTION-ERA LOYALISTS

<P>
   SHELBURNE, Nova Scotia _ The first wave of dispossessed arrived
by ship in May 1783. Within a year, this fishing port on Nova
Scotia's rugged south shore ranked among the biggest centers in
North America, in a league with Boston, New York, and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Shelburne's brief boom owed everything to war and the often
vengeful politics of a fledgling republic called the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our settlers came fleeing for their lives from up and down the
13 former colonies, from the Carolinas to Boston,'' said Finn
Bower, curator of the Shelburne County Museum and descendant of one
of the town's founders. ``They were escaping mob terror.''
</P>
<P>
   For if the American War of Independence forged a new sort of
nation, one dedicated to individual liberty, it also made refugees
of tens of thousands of men, women, and children driven from their
homeland for refusing to pledge allegiance to the revolutionary
regime.
</P>
<P>
   They called themselves loyalists, although their former
neighbors applied harsher sobriquets, often along with a slathering
of tar and feathers.
</P>
<P>
   And though Americans seldom think of it, the forced exodus of
the loyalists gave birth to another new country on the continent _
one equally democratic, but to this day profoundly different in
tone and temperament.
</P>
<P>
   When New Englanders celebrate Patriots Day, April 19 this year,
Canadians in the three provinces more or less created by loyalist
exiles _ New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Ontario _ prepare opposite
observances, celebrating the influx that so shaped the character of
their nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of our loyalist past. It sets us apart from the
US,'' said Bernice Wood Flett of London, Ontario, former president
of the United Empire Loyalists Association of Canada and descendant
of a Mohawk Valley loyalist who joined the King's Royal Regiment to
fight George Washington's rebel army.
</P>
<P>
   Loyalist spirit still runs deep in Canada, especially in the
Maritime Provinces and Ontario, where Union Jacks flutter atop
front yard flagpoles and many citizens take stubborn pride in the
country's loyalty to English royalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Canadian attitudes owe much to loyalist tradition,'' Flett
said. ``The loyalists sought peace, order and good government _ not
the American dream of life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   The wealthy few were able to flee to England, but roughly 80,000
loyalists had little choice but to sail or trek overland to
Britain's sparsely inhabited Canadian possessions, an extraordinary
upheaval for those times.
</P>
<P>
   Most had not so much opposed the goals of the Revolution _ tax
relief, more democratic representation, home rule _ than the
violent means. Many had simply feared that replacing monarchy with
a revolutionary republic would cost them the cherished liberties
guaranteed by English common law.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the loyalists carried north a yearning for
stability as much as for freedom, and Canada _ stolid and
law-abiding, although in some ways a more tolerant society than the
United States _ still reflects their cautious vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``These exiles had been threatened by mobs, seen their lands and
possessions stolen in the name of `liberty,' and given the option
of renouncing their principles or fleeing their homes,'' said
Christopher Moore of Toronto, author of ``The Loyalists,'' a
historical account. ``It made them a bit mistrustful of ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a myth, in both Canada and the United States, that the
loyalists, or ``tories,'' were merely pampered aristocrats fearful
of losing their profits and perquisites. But they were just
ordinary Americans of the time _ farmers as well as upper-class
Harvard graduates; barrelmakers, shipwrights, fishermen, artisans
and herdsmen along with the more stereotypical prosperous merchants
and plantation owners.
</P>
<P>
   Some loyalists were blacks who escaped slavery by casting their
lot with the British redcoats.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, your American land of liberty wasn't exactly
paradise for black people,'' said Anna Scott Smith of Shelburne,
descended from one of the thousands of black loyalists who sided
with King George III simply because so many southern slave-owners
supported the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ancestors sure didn't come to Canada for the sunny
weather,'' said Smith, who presides over a spectacular rock garden
on land that has been her family's for centuries. ``And I don't
think it was because they were crazy in love with the king or
queen. They just needed a place to get on with their own
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, descendants of the loyalists are entitled by royal decree
to append the initials ``U.E.,'' for ``United Empire,'' to their
names _ the only hereditary title recognized in Canada. Last year,
Ontario joined Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in officially
proclaiming a day in honor of the loyalists and their contribution
to Canadian history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loyalism is a part of our national identity, and reverberates
to this day,'' said John Aimers, dominion chairman of the
Monarchist League of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of their loyalist history, Canadians have always
been alternately amused and horrified by the sort of rah-rah
jingoism and chest-thumping patriotism that sometimes surface to
the south.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like America and Americans, but walking the Freedom Trail
during a visit to Massachusetts last summer, I found my hackles
rising a bit _ all those historical markers with their stunning
oversimplifications,'' said Moore. ``Americans seem to believe they
invented the only and perfect path to freedom. But Canada also
managed to create a free, democratic and just society, and did so
without taking up arms against the imperial power.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans view the Revolution as a heroic rising against a
tyrannical monarchy. That notion ignores the view that Britain of
the 18th century was the freest society on earth, and that the
inhabitants of the 13 Colonies enjoyed prosperity and liberties
``nearly inconceivable in most of the rest of the world,'' in
Moore's words.
</P>
<P>
   There were unjust taxes, there were injustices in the way
Colonial interests were represented in Parliament, there were
legitimate grievances against a system that was repressive in a
bureaucratic sense _ but few Americans were squirming under the
boot heel of a serious oppression.
</P>
<P>
   And those that were weren't exactly victims of the English.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10,000 refugees who would eventually settle Shelburne
beginning with the first loyalist landing in May 1783, about 1,500
were blacks, many of them runaway slaves, including two who had
belonged to George Washington, by local account.
</P>
<P>
   There would be racial tensions in Canada, too, and many early
black settlers in Nova Scotia went on to resettle in Sierra Leone,
in West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But many also stayed on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our roots go deep in this rocky soil,'' said Smith, whose
dining-room wall is lined with photographs of Nova Scotia
forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands more loyalists settled in other parts of Nova
Scotia, New Brunswick, Ontario and the Eastern Townships of Quebec,
north of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, loyalist memories remain long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly all of us come from families stripped of lands, homes,
and possessions,'' said Flett. ``For example, New York's World
Trade Center is sitting on land stolen from the Ryerson family, now
of Ontario.''
</P>
<P>
   Loyalist land claims remain an issue between Canada and the
United States, one unlikely ever to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   It was only partly in jest that three years ago Canadian
lawmakers, parodying the US Helms-Burton law that allows Americans
to use US courts to claim property lost in Cuba's communist
revolution, introduced a bill in Parliament in Ottawa meant to
force the United States to cough up billions of dollars' worth of
confiscated loyalist lands and property.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 3 million Canadians descended from uprooted loyalists
should be allowed to sue for return of our stolen property,'' said
one of the bill's sponsors, John Godfrey, whose ancestral land was
seized in Virginia. ``What happened to loyalists in the US is no
less outrageous than what happened in Cuba.''

CAUGHT IN A CYCLE OF ESCALATION: WAR MIMICS HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>

 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three-and-a-half weeks into the NATO bombing of
Yugoslavia, the operation seems to be turning into a case study of
how wars escalate: More and more weapons and crews are thrown into
battle, even as the aims seem elusive and the costs spin out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   More NATO warplanes are landing at air bases near Yugoslavia,
and the number of raids is expected to expand by more than 50
percent in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Apache helicopters due this week are expected to be accompanied
by long-range artillery rockets and their crews, and by the first
handful of M1 Abrams battle tanks and M2 Bradley infantry fighting
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of reservists may soon be called up _ the Pentagon is
asking President Clinton for the authority to summon as many as
33,000, mainly to fly and service all the new planes coming into
the region.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, meanwhile, seems firmly
in charge, despite the vast numbers of bombs that have rained down
on his country. His troops in and around Kosovo have not budged _
except to mount the occasional incursion across Albania's borders.
They burned 45 more Kosovar villages in the past 10 days, according
to the State Department. Their air defense weapons remain so
formidable that NATO pilots are still forbidden to fly lower than
15,000 feet. This makes it extremely difficult to be precise in
attacks on military targets.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, General Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, told members of the Senate Armed Services
Committee that the bombing will accomplish NATO's military
objective of ``degrading'' Milosevic's armed forces _ but might not
bring about the political goal, to compel Milosevic to pull out of
Kosovo and to let the ethnic Albanians back in.
</P>
<P>
   And so, as the logic of escalation dictates, NATO has no choice
but to send in more firepower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine Clinton went into this thinking Milosevic
wouldn't cave after a few days of airstrikes,'' one Pentagon
official said late last week.
</P>
<P>
   It is a syndrome seen in many places, many times before. Country
A sends in planes, ships, or troops, to persuade Country B to stop
its aggression. Country B continues, so A sends in more weapons, to
no avail. Soon, Country A finds its credibility to be on the line.
Unable to withdraw, it sends still more force into the fray, until
maintaining credibility itself becomes the mission.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known instance of this was the US bombing of North
Vietnam, as documented in ``The Pentagon Papers,'' the collection
of classified materials that Daniel Ellsberg leaked.
</P>
<P>
   As McGeorge Bundy, the national security adviser, explained to
President Lyndon Baines Johnson in a May 1964 memorandum, the
bombing would be ``for the purpose of changing the North Vietnamese
decision on intervention in the south.''
</P>
<P>
   The bombing campaign, code-named Rolling Thunder, began on March
2, 1965. Within three weeks, Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara's
chief adviser, John McNaughton, found that it was not working.
</P>
<P>
   On March 24, McNaughton wrote McNamara: ``The situation in
Vietnam is bad and deteriorating.'' The aim now, he continued,
should be simply to avoid damaging ``our reputation as a
guarantor.'' He called for a ``program of progressive military
pressure,'' so the United States would ``emerge as a `good doctor.'
We must have kept promises, been tough, taken risks, gotten
bloodied and hurt the enemy very badly.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA agreed. ``If anything, the strikes to date have
hardened'' attitudes, the agency wrote in an April memo. Therefore,
it added, ``We must hit them harder, more frequently, and inflict
greater damage.''
</P>
<P>
   The bombs kept falling, and the troops got bloodied, for another
10 years, at gargantuan cost, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo may not be Vietnam; Milosevic may not be Ho Chi Minh; the
Yugoslav army and paramilitary police may not be the Viet Cong. Not
even the skeptics of this campaign think NATO will lose, in the
sense that the United States lost in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are parallels: how casually Western political
leaders entered the conflict; how quickly the assumptions of
victory fell apart; yet how doggedly they pressed on and escalated
the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, when the Clinton administration persuaded the NATO
allies to authorize strikes against Serbian targets if Milosevic
did not stop massacres of Kosovar Albanians, the idea must have
seemed logical.
</P>
<P>
   Three years earlier, after all, in the fall of 1995, Milosevic
had come back to the tables, and had signed the Dayton Accord,
which led to peace in Bosnia. Richard Holbrooke, Clinton's Bosnian
emissary, who negotiated that treaty, wrote a memoir of that
experience, ``To Build a Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   In it, he said that Milosevic had relented because of a
successful US bombing campaign against his troops just before.
</P>
<P>
   So, in October 1998, when Milosevic refused to let go of Kosovo,
Holbrooke and others _ most notably Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright _ figured the threat of bombing would make Milosevic cower
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought they were doing the endgame of the Dayton Accord
again,'' said Robert Pape, professor of national security studies
at Dartmouth College.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's team was apparently unbothered by the Joint Chiefs of
Staff's skepticism about airstrikes over Kosovo. The Chiefs had
opposed the strikes in 1995 as well.
</P>
<P>
   However, Pape said, the 1995 raids were preceded by a Croatian
and Muslim ground offensive that pushed half a million Serbs out of
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airstrikes prevented the Serbs from providing
reinforcements,'' said Pape, who has published an exhaustive study
of air campaigns. ``As a result, had the Muslim and Croat troops
kept advancing, the retreating Serbs could not have stopped them.''
</P>
<P>
   However, without the Croat troops on the ground, Pape argued,
the air raids alone would not have compelled Milosevic to sign the
Dayton Accords. Similarly, he said, without troops on the ground
now, NATO strikes are not likely to make him sign the Rambouillet
accord, which would eventually give Kosovo autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of ground forces raises the big question: How far are
Clinton and other NATO leaders likely to go?
</P>
<P>
   General Shelton said before the Senate last week that the NATO
allies' political leaders are so adamantly opposed to a land
invasion that they have instructed General Wesley K. Clark, NATO's
supreme commander, not even to draw up plans for it.
</P>
<P>
   This prohibition may have stemmed from a recognition that ``the
escalation ladder,'' as a military strategist, Herman Kahn, once
called it, has no logical limits _ that its rungs extend as high as
one might want to climb them _ unless limits are explicitly
imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Or, another strategist, Bernard Brodie, said: ``One way of
keeping people out of trouble is to deny them the means of getting
into it.''
</P>
<P>
   So the question becomes: What does NATO do next, if, as Shelton
himself seems to expect, the bombing does not push out Milosevic,
yet ground war remains a forbidden option? The most likely answer
is the one the CIA gave back in 1965: Bomb some more.
</P>
<P>
   US officials have said the campaign might go on for months, and
up to a year. They have voiced hope that the relentless pressure
makes Milosevic scream. Cohen has said one result might be that the
Serbian army gets weaker, while the Kosovo Liberation Army gets
stronger, until the balance tips in the Kosovars' favor, and the
Serbs are forced out that way.
</P>
<P>
   Some theorize that at some point, after both sides have tired of
the destruction, a compromise will be put on the table, by a
neutral party _ like the Russians or the UN _ and the war will end
that way.
</P>
<P>
   But all these possibilities could lie a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing now is still relatively light bombing,'' Pape
said. ``We've got F-16s flying 500 miles per hour at 15,000 feet
altitude. You're not going to hit very much that way, especially
the forces in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's troops will feel more pressure once more A10 planes
and Apache helicopters take to the air, and once they are backed up
by long-range, fast-firing artillery rockets. This may start
happening in days.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Pape voiced doubt that bombing alone would do the
trick. ``You can't find a single instance in history when a state
surrenders a major interest because of punishment from the air,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of the more optimistic-sounding officials are
finding reasons to voice hope that, with the bombing getting
heavier, the next round of air raids might do the trick.

HAVING A `SENIOR MOMENT'? RELAX. YOU HAVE NOT LOST YOUR MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lorraine Harding, who retired from a Massachusetts Institute of
Technology administrative job 18 months ago, still lives near MIT
and often runs into her former colleagues. And that can pose an
annoying little problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go nuts trying to remember people's names,'' says the
71-year-old Cambridge resident. ``I see someone whose face is
familiar but I have to go through the alphabet trying to find their
name. It's a little embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   People beyond a certain age _ 50 seems to be the rough threshold
_ often joke about these ``senior moments.'' The familiar
tip-of-the-tongue feeling. The where-did-I-put-those-keys or
park-that-car episode. The word, book title, or celebrity's name
you know you know, but can no longer produce on demand.
</P>
<P>
   Harding was concerned enough to take a workshop on ``Brainergy''
at the Cambridge Center for Adult Education run by Gessner Geyer, a
self-described ``popularizer'' of the fashionable notion that
mental calisthenics, such as name games, reading upside-down text,
and mental arithmetic, along with one-nostril-at-a-time breathing
exercises, can tone up the brain the way weight-lifting builds
muscle. ``It helped a little,'' Harding reports. ``It was very
energizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Practicing physicians and aging experts say the ``senior
moment'' issue pops up frequently these days. ``Memory is the
problem that worries people most about aging, and it's because of
the specter of Alzheimer's disease,'' says Dr. John W. Rowe, a
leading gerontologist who is president of Mount Sinai-NYU Medical
Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The concern is understandable. Alzheimer's disease, which
typically begins with forgetfulness and progresses at varying rates
to profound dementia, afflicts as many as four million Americans _
many of them parents of people who are themselves turning 50 at the
unprecedented rate of more than 9,000 a day. The prevalence of
Alzheimer's doubles every five years after age 65; as many as 30
percent to 50 percent of those over 85 are affected.
</P>
<P>
   But memory lapses of the type that plague Harding are virtually
universal by late middle age, and have nothing to do with
Alzheimer's or any other disease, experts say. The forgetfulness
that signals Alzheimer's arises from a different part of the brain
than the region involved in ``senior moments,'' and it manifests
itself differently.
</P>
<P>
   People with early Alzheimer's often cannot call up ordinary
nouns, such as the names of familiar objects like ``fork'' or
``radio,'' and they're less aware they're forgetting things than
those with the occasional memory problems of normal aging.
</P>
<P>
   People with normal memory lapses typically have trouble
retrieving information, especially names, from their accumulated
store of knowledge. They may not be able to absorb the name of a
new acquaintance, for instance, without extra effort. And they have
more trouble attending to several things at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, a misplaced object or proper name is not a
worrisome event,'' says Dr. Ronald C. Petersen, director of the
Mayo Clinic's Alzheimer's disease center. ``But when people tell me
they've been missing appointments or things they really care about,
I start to worry. Once or twice is OK, but when this kind of
behavior happens repeatedly, that's more bothersome.''
</P>
<P>
   Molly Wagster, a neuroscientist at the National Institute on
Aging, agrees: ``Those worried about `senior moments' should worry
when it becomes more than a moment. I don't think we know how many
senior moments it takes to make a demented individual. If you start
with one a week and progress to 10 and stabilize there, is
everything going to be OK? The answer is probably yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another useful test to distinguish between normal age-related
memory changes and early Alzheimer's is whether the ``lost'' word,
or key, or parked car, is ultimately found _ and what your reaction
to it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you and I can't remember where we parked the car or put
the keys, and then we remember, we usually have a sense of
recollection,'' says Marilyn Albert, director of gerontology
research at Massachusetts General Hospital. ``We think, `Oh yes,
now I remember: When I came in the phone rang and I put my glasses
down there.' People in the very early stages of Alzheimer's tend
not to have that sense of recollection, even when they are
reminded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news,'' adds Dr. Robert Schreiber, a Lahey Cliic
geriatrician who sees several patients a month worried about balky
memory, ``is that if you're eventually able to recall what you were
trying to remember, you don't have a problem. Over 95 percent of
the time it's just normal aging.''
</P>
<P>
   The cognitive problems of normal aging can be broken down into
several types, researchers say:
</P>
<P>
   _ Sluggish retrieval of words and proper names, a phenomenon
called (even in sober scientific papers) the ``tip of the tongue''
problem;
</P>
<P>
   _ Greater difficulty learning new material; and
</P>
<P>
   _ Impaired ``executive'' functioning, such as an inability to
locate the car in a parking garage, tend to several tasks at once,
switch from one thing to another, or carry out intentions (``Why
did I come into this room?'').
</P>
<P>
   All of these functions involve the brain's frontal lobe, and
indeed, sophisticated brain imaging techniques show diminished
frontal-lobe activity in older versus younger individuals asked to
perform such tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to do with manipulating information and keeping it
on-line,'' says Albert.
</P>
<P>
   In Alzheimer's disease, the main problem area is the
hippocampus, a structure deep in the temporal lobe, or mid-brain,
that is important in maintaining moment-to-moment memory _ the
normally continuous thread of consciousness. In imaging studies of
healthy older people, Albert notes, ``we see very little change in
the hippocampus, but a lot of change in the frontal lobes.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Burke, a Pomona College psychologist, is a leading
expert on the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon, which she has found is
``the top complaint of older adults.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has tip-of-the-tongue problems, even children, but we
have found that word-finding ability gets worse in middle age,''
Burke says. ``And healthy 65-to-75-year-olds report more of these
experiences than 35-to-45-year-olds.''
</P>
<P>
   When young adults search for a word or name, more associations
and clues come to mind than when elders do the same task. ``In
older adults, fewer alternate words come to mind,'' she says.
``They say to us, `My mind just feels blank.' That's quite
different from younger adults, who often get the first letter or a
similar-sounding word.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke's husband, psychologist Donald McKay of the University of
California at Los Angeles, has also found that spelling ability
deteriorates with age.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost as if the neural links that permit rapid retrieval
of words and letters fade with age, Burke says. That is why
remaining ``verbally active,'' as she puts it, through activities
such as conversaton, reading, writing, and crossword puzzles, seems
to help maintain word-finding fluency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you retrieve information in memory, it strengthens
the connection,'' Burke says. ``It's sort of a renewing
phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   But while researchers expose the memory problems of aging, it's
important to keep in mind which cognitive functions do not wane
with advancing years.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Charness of Florida State University has shown that older
chess players were every bit as skilled at playing the game as
younger players of matched ability _ even when their memory was
demonstrably worse. In fact, older players tended to choose the
equally good chess move in less time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out that experience is a very important determinant
of performance,'' Charness reports. ``The knowledge and experience
that people have allows them to compensate for age-related memory
deficits.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an important message as societies around the world
confront aging populations and the challenges of keeping people
healthy and productive into their advanced years. ``There is a
strong relationship between age and memory,'' Charness says. ``But
there's virtually zero correlation between someone's age and job
performance.''

FROM CHIC TO SCHLOCK FOR J. PETERMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can a catalog have ambience? If ever one did, surely it was the
J. Peterman catalog. That may have been just about all it had _
ambience _ but it worked, for just over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog broke all the rules. A small, vertical format. Lots
of white space. No photographs. Just line drawings and watercolors.
It was the copy that put it in a class by itself, although just
which class was debatable. Some thought the copy evocative,
romantic, literary. To others it was pretentious, overblown,
ridiculous:
</P>
<P>
   ``D. H. Lawrence appears to be smiling and sipping warm scotch.
Lady Ottoline's party is the usual mix: authors, beautiful women,
eccentric painters, and an occasional prime minister. Lawrence
appears dignified and shy in a muted woolen suit, fortified against
the chill with a high-necked alpaca waistcoat . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The D. H. Lawrence waistcoat. The Gatsby shirt. The Hemingway
cap. The Bacall blouse. The merchandise was described anecdotally
in short, short stories designed to make people think, ``I've got
to have that!'' J. Peterman didn't sell mere clothing, it sold
fantasy at inflated prices. It became a target for satirists,
including the writers of ``Seinfeld,'' who had Elaine working for
the company, headed by a fictional J. Peterman given to declaiming,
in orotund tones, language that might have been lifted from the
catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Now the J. Peterman company has filed for bankruptcy and its
remaining stock is being offered at 60 percent to 80 percent off
catalog prices. In the Boston sale, it'll cost you $2 admission and
$6 to park. It's surprising how many people are eager to pay. Such
is the lure of a bargain and of J. Peterman.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much ambience at the sale. It's housed in a
cheerless room the size of an airplane hangar. There are tables
full of merchandise, some of it still bearing a whiff of the J.
Peterman mystique _ a ``Romanov'' caviar keeper for $26.99, a set
of four ``Havana'' rum glasses for $9.99. And there are racks and
racks of clothes, hanging dispiritedly in the harsh overhead
lighting, almost as if they know how low they've sunk. Gone is the
romance that once was divine, to borrow a line from an appropriate
song.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it never was romantic, really, much less divine. The
J. Peterman success story was built on illusion, a risky
foundation. The company moved steak by selling sizzle. It offered
intangibles: romance, class, adventure. It held out the impossible
hope that you can buy cachet from a mail-order catalog.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of J. Peterman, a sorry tale of greed and
mismanagement, was described by reporter Leslie Kaufman in the
April 2 New York Times. Toward the end, as the company faced ruin,
a decision was made to use cheaper materials for the clothing line.
The result is apparent at the sale. There are some quality items
and a few genuine bargains. But there's a lot of tacky stuff that's
overpriced even at 60 to 80 percent off.
</P>
<P>
   Browsing through the racks, it was impossible not to try to meet
the challenge of writing J. Peterman-style copy for some of the
unlikelier items, a Nehru jacket, for instance: ``Late '60s. Vegas.
The Sands. The Rat Pack. Backstage, I was knocked out by Sammy's
threads . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The sale is a long way from the catalog, a far cry from those
florid descriptions of signature J. Peterman items like the
Hemingway cap: ``He probably bought his in a gas station on the
road to Ketchum, next to the cash register, among the beef jerky .
. .'' And you can be sure he didn't pay $35 for it, the catalog
price.

   The booming Boomer market for memory aids is producing a new
wave of products that may be hard to resist, even for people who
consider themselves too sophisticated to swallow many New Age-y
nostrums.
</P>
<P>
   But should you believe?
</P>
<P>
   Will ginkgo biloba in your One-a-Days keep you mentally sharp?
Should you start chewing Brain Gum for the tonic effect of
phosphatidylserine? How about the antioxidant properties of vitamin
E? Post-menopausal estrogen for the gray matter as well as for
maintenance of heart and bone?
</P>
<P>
   And then there are new books and workshops with names like
``Neurobics'' and ``Brainergy.'' Should you embrace claims that you
can pump up your mental ability with maneuvers like brushing your
teeth with the non-dominant hand, taking a roundabout route to
work, or getting dressed with your eyes closed?
</P>
<P>
   It all depends on how gullible you are. When leading
neuroscientists recently met to plan an upcoming meeting, ``We went
through the world's literature looking for anything reasonable'' as
a memory-enhancer, says Dr. Richard Wurtman of MIT. ``We included
none of this stuff because there's no there there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, researchers who study the aging brain say there are
varying degrees of likelihood that this or that remedy may actually
do something.
</P>
<P>
   Ginkgo and phosphatidylserine (the ingredient in a
``memory-enhancer'' called Brain Gum) are at the bottom of the
list. Yes, there are some studies suggesting possible benefits in
animals and humans, and maybe some reason to do more. But not
enough evidence for mainstream researchers to take these products
themselves, let alone start recommending them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ginkgo biloba is not on my plate,'' says Dr. John Rowe,
coauthor of a recent book, ``Successful Aging.'' However, Rowe _
and many gerontologists _ do take daily doses of vitamin E (Rowe
takes 800 units), because of studies suggesting a benefit for the
heart and possibly the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, recent evidence suggests supplemental estrogen may
maintain memory and brain function in older women. (The effects of
male hormones on the brain have not been much studied.)
</P>
<P>
   As for mental exercise, research supports a general positive
effect from staying mentally active and engaged _ and physically
active too. One surprising finding of a large MacArthur Foundation
research project on healthy elders is that good lung function was
strongly associated with good mental function.
</P>
<P>
   But an effect from supposedly mind-stretching calisthenics like
word games and sensory ticklers? No basis, just thin hypothesis.
</P>
<P>
   And in the future? Stay tuned. Scientists now know they were
wrong about the still-popular notion that the brain loses billions
of neurons as we age. What is lost, according to Yale University
neuroscientist Amy Arnsten, are other cells, which nourish and
support the gray matter, or the ``thinking'' brain.
</P>
<P>
   That's actually great news. If ways can be found to restore the
``neurochemical environment'' of the brain, that might renew
youthful function or at least prevent deterioration. ``We're trying
to see if we can give drugs to restore function in aged monkeys,''
Arnsten says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Arnsten is taking her daily vitamin E. For her heart
or her head? ``Oh, who cares!'' she replies.

IN OLKAHOMA, OLD WOUNDS, NEW DIVISIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ On the fourth floor of the old Montgomery Ward
building, where federal housing employees took refuge four years
ago, the tombstone simply appeared one late-summer day.
</P>
<P>
   Gray and no more than 3 feet tall, it was etched with 35 names.
Each one represented a housing secretary or manager, attorney or
director, killed when a truck bomb tore through the Alfred P.
Murrah federal building on April 19, 1995. The survivors had to
face the horror of what had happened to their colleagues, of what
had happened to them, every time they stepped on or off the
elevators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very controversial, and it said a lot about how
different people were dealing with what happened,'' said an agency
employee who was in the Murrah building that morning, but who still
asked to remain anonymous for fear of appearing insensitive. ``One
group said, `These were our friends.' Another group said, `They
were our friends, too, but we're tired of looking at it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Today &LR; , four years after 168 of their own _ 19 babies and
toddlers among them _ died in the deadliest act of terrorism ever
committed on US soil, the almost instinctive unity that sent
strangers running into the Murrah building to help has given way to
subtle, sometimes painful divisions over how to honor the memory of
the deceased while respecting the needs of the living. Grieving,
always personal, is also communal in this city of 480,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone dies, people think, `How can the world go on?'
But the world does go on,'' said Dr. Stewart Beasley, an Oklahoma
City psychologist. ``But in Oklahoma, you can't drive far without
coming close to it again. People here are constantly facing it and
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The tombstone has long since been tucked away in what US
Department of Housing and Urban Development employees call the
``reflections room,'' an in-house memorial that some visit often,
some never. But at least two other monuments to the murdered will
be unavoidable: the memorial and museum slated to open next spring
on the site where the Murrah and several other buildings stood, and
the upcoming state trial of one of two men already convicted in
federal court for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Painful as a memorial may be to pass every day, most of the
people who live and work in this city praise the idea as
appropriate and life-affirming. But the state trial of Terry L.
Nichols, already sentenced to life in prison after a federal trial,
has caused a deep rift among survivors and victims' relatives.
</P>
<P>
   One side insists that justice demands the death penalty, the
sentence co-conspirator Timothy J. McVeigh received for murdering
eight federal agents, among other charges. They say it is
unfathomable that at the federal trial Nichols won the right to
watch his son and two daughters grow to adulthood while they can
only visit their parents' and children's graves.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols, who was not in Oklahoma City the day of the blast, was
convicted in the federal trial of conspiring to bomb the building
and of involuntary manslaughter in the eight agents' deaths. Now he
will stand trial for the deaths of the 160 other victims.
</P>
<P>
   As Doris Jones, whose 26-year-old daughter, Carrie Lenz, learned
she was carrying a son the day before she died, put it, ``He was
not tried specifically for my daughter's murder, and I want to see
that.'' Added Erik McKisick, a district manager with the Social
Security Administration who was covered in debris but otherwise
uninjured in the blast, ``I would like to see him get more than
what I consider a slap on the wrist.''
</P>
<P>
   But many people here say that they accept Nichols's federal
sentence, and that another trial, even one held in Tulsa, would be
too tough on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us have taken a giant step forward, and this will be
a step backward,'' said Emmett ``Bud'' Welch, an anti-death-penalty
activist whose 23-year-old daughter, Julie, was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Added Richard Williams, the Murrah building manager, whose
injuries required surgery after surgery over two years, ``It won't
be helpful at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma County District Attorney Bob Macy defended his decision
to put Nichols through a state trial as the will of the people. In
the days after the devastation, he said, they made him promise to
put the bombers to death. Now, with a roomful of documents
accumulated in the federal government's $82.5 million prosecution,
he has $800,000 in state funds to do that. McVeigh will be tried in
Oklahoma only if his death sentence is overturned on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will reopen old wounds,'' Macy said. ``A lot
of people feel like they need this before they can close the
chapter on it and stop the hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   That argument infuriates Randall Coyne, an associate law
professor at the University of Oklahoma who also scoffed at Macy's
contention that an impartial jury can be found anywhere in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ears are starting to tune out the shrill and repetitive voices
of the people who have made a life out of the bombing,'' Coyne
said. ``The ones who are quiet don't want to look back every
anniversary.''
</P>
<P>
   This anniversary, the Federal Employees Credit Union is
dedicating a garden at its new offices to the city's tears, with
granite from the Murrah building used in the small reflecting pool.
More than half of the 33 employees then working for the agency were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Another monument to remembering that most everyone in Oklahoma
City seems to approve is the downtowm memorial and museum. People
call the land ``sacred ground'' and say it must be commemorated.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Boston's Butzer Design Partnership, whose entry won
out over 623 others, with Watertown's Sasaki Associates as
architects, the design is intended to combine the enormity of what
happened with the hope that it will never happen again. As many as
450,000 visitors a year are expected the 3-acre site, where 168
empty chairs will represent the dead and an orchard will represent
rescue workers. Stories of survivors and rescuers will be available
on tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``People heal at their own pace, and some have been able to go
on without forgetting and some haven't,'' said Williams, the Murrah
building manager, who served on the memorial selection committee.
``We're a unique fraternity. We understand each other in a way no
one else can. . . . People ask why we keep opening up old wounds.
Well, they never closed. But our goal is to show the world we can
go on.''

GAETA THE GURU BEHIND THE TRICKS OF `THE MATRIX' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Matrix,'' the semi-dark $60 million sci-fi flick that has
resurrected Keanu Reeves's career, has been the No. 1 movie in the
country for the last two weeks, grossing $72.9 million. Some people
find the plot a bit muddled or, at the least, hard to follow: The
dreams keep blending into reality, and reality itself seems to play
out inside a computer. Others find the tangled web a very cool
thing, an ``Alice in Wonderland''-cum-``Blade Runner'' for the
pre-millennium computer-graphics generation. Or they just
don't &UR;  &LR; care. That's because the buzz is about the jaw-dropping
special effects.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the work of John Gaeta, 33; the people at his northern
California company, Manex; and two Australian companies, DFilm and
Animal Logic. Over the phone from his San Francisco office last
week, the visual-effects supervisor is tossed a big fat softball,
right over the plate: How many times should a fan plunk down his or
her $7.75 to figure this ``Matrix'' thing out?
</P>
<P>
   ``Three,'' he says, without a moment's pause. ``One: for the
emotional impact. Two: to understand the story. And three: to
understand the deeper story.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't, you may note, mention that he wants people to gorge
on and marvel over the special effects. ``It's inevitable'' that
folks will, he says, ``but it's not my goal. My goal, actually, is
to have shots that work seamlessly. That is, the most gratification
I have ever gotten has been on this project and with people saying
it was seamless. . . . We're filmmakers. We're desperate to feel
part of the process, and when we're detached and used as glitter,
then _ I mean, some people are content with that, but that's not
the case with someone like myself who is a designer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix,'' which opened March 31 to mixed reviews, stars
Reeves as a computer hacker who lives in a future disguised as the
present, controlled by computers (the Matrix). There are rebels,
and they think Reeves is their savior. But it was the effects, not
the plot, that pushed the movie to set box-office records for early
spring.
</P>
<P>
   On ``60 Minutes'' a few weeks ago, ``Star Wars'' maven George
Lucas discussed with Diane Sawyer the artifice involved with
special effects _ and the people who complained about what they saw
as this newfangled computerized trickery. Hey, he said, in effect,
wake up. It's movies! It's all make-believe, every bit of it.
Filmmakers have always used whatever tools and technology have been
available to attempt to enhance the cinematic experience. Georges
Melies did it in ``A Trip to the Moon'' in 1902. Even poor old Ed
Wood did the best he could with strings and wires in ``Plan 9 From
Outer Space'' in 19591959.
</P>
<P>
   ``Totally, absolutely,'' says Gaeta, wholeheartedly backing
Lucas's comments. ``It's like Impressionism. What are you going to
do? Shoot down Impressionism bcause it's not totally realistic
paintings like the masters did?'' The anti-special-effects comments
``are like a joke as far as I'm concerned. Technology and movies
were made for one another.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A curious role &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the special-effects teams are in a curious position: They're
an integral part of the overall package, yet they are detached from
the actual assembly of the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' says Gaeta, ``it's up to the creators of the film, the
producers and directors, to decide whether it's going to have a
seamless integration, and most of them decide not, because of, I
guess, naivety or thinking visual effects is a service that is
snapped on as a post (-production) process to attract viewers in a
razzly-dazzly way, but not necessarily with any shots they rely on
to tell stories.''
</P>
<P>
   And what movies might fall into that category? ``Without naming
names?'' says Gaeta, with a laugh. ``There are a lot of films that
I find so absolutely pristine that it seems the stories were
propped up to deliver that visual, whether these be dinosaur movies
or where there's a twister'' and the plot seems ``a vehicle to get
you to that image.'' (Whew. At least Gaeta didn't name names.)
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't the case with `The Matrix,' '' he continues. ``The
Wachowski brothers (writer-directors Larry and Andy) and I hit it
off from the beginning. We're the same age; we have the same
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Which are? ``The whole Gen X-alternative entertainment needs,
ranging from comic books to deviant cult movies to taste in sci-fi
and music in general, which is an unspoken tie.'' Also, and
obviously, a love of the Japanese-style animation called anime, in
which a camera follows an object in motion while moving the
audience's viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Gaeta relates the techno flash of ``The Matrix'' _ its sometimes
dizzying pace, its mix of darkness and light, of edginess and
seeming randomness _ to the mostly instrumental musical genre known
as electronica. ``It's a movie made for and by peole who have grown
up with computer technology, digital presentation, and electronica,
where the end result is a composite of samples of other things, a
blend of influences leading to a higher state. I think the movie
business is going to experience some form of this digital blender,
and I think the Wachowski brothers . . . hit an audience which is
basically comfortable with snappy digital presentation, the
nuances.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros., the studio that released the film, liked the early
scenes Gaeta and company were working on so much it allowed the
filmmakers to more than double the number of special-effects shots
to over 400. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The beauty of flo-mo &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gaeta has a lot to be proud of, including a scene in which
Reeves appears to dodge and outrun bullets. This is a multiple
still-camera effect that Gaeta equates with stop-motion
photography, something he calls ``flow-mo.'' (The cameras shoot
multiple images of an undulating Reeves.) There are several scary
roof-to-roof-in-a-single-bound jumping scenes. (How'd he do that?)
There are many odious creatures and face-bending effects, but Gaeta
says after the flow-mo he is most pleased with the creepy ``fetus
field,'' in which the machines that look like men harvest the
humans they need to supply their life-giving electrical charge.
``It took over a year to do, and it's a miraculous achievement in
computer graphics,'' he says. ``It contains some of the most
complex textures I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaeta, who admires the work of H. R. Giger, the designer of the
aliens in the ``Aliens'' movies, went to film school at New York
University, worked on the ``Saturday Night Live'' animations, and
cut his teeth on animated-TV ads. He spent five years in the
Berkshires with Mass Illusions, the company that evolved into Manex
when it moved to the West Coast 1 1/2 years ago. (Manex employs
between 20 and 100 people, depending on the work needed to be done,
and 40 at the moment.) Gaeta says he served as an associate
visual-tech supervisor on ``Starship Troopers,'' ``Eraser,'' and
``Judge Dredd.''
</P>
<P>
   One potential downside of today's whiz-bang effects might be
that fans become so inured to and numbed by what they see that they
shrug and say, ``So what?'' It almost seems that with today's
technology, if you can visualize it in your head, you can bring if
off on film, via computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not entirely true,'' says Gaeta. Anyway, he says, his task is
to make the visuals ``truly engaging'' even to an audience that is
``to some extent jaded by the intensity of visual effects.'' The
upside of that, he adds, is that if people aren't obsessing over
the special effects or how they were done, they'll pay attention to
the story. One of the criteria for the ``Matrix'' effects was that
each have ``a story point _ some critical information that moved
the story one beat further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like,'' Gaeta continues, ``when the helicopter crashed into
the (office) building. I could have had it just explode into the
building and it would be like eye candy, but we wanted to avoid it
solely being that. We wanted to use it as another vehicle to show
that the material integrity of a virtual reality is not what you
think it is. When the copter hits the building, the building reacts
like a pebble in a lake, when you drop a pebble in and it ripples.
The lack of material structure supports (the theme) of the dream
state, and that the Matrix, the city, is supposed to be the prison,
the mental prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard-core fans may note, says Gaeta, that the ripple frequency
of the building matches the ripple frequency of a mirror shown
earlier in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even something as simple as the plastic Joel Silver Explosion
moment is turned into something more cerebral,'' he says,
``Cerebral Silver.Gaeta is both praising and kidding the producer
of ``The Matrix,'' and less intellectual blow-'em-ups such as
``Commando,'' ``Lethal Weapon,'' and ``Die Hard.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to future possibilities, Gaeta is one happy
special-effects supervisor. It's a brave new world out there. ``We
have just started scratching the surface of the beginning of doing
virtual environments,'' he says. The day of ``not 3-D, but
three-dimensional movies is five to 10 years away.''

TODAY'S GARDENERS ENJOY BOUNTIFUL TOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gardening became a recognized status symbol a few
centuries ago. Early well-to-do homeowners had only to hire the
likes of Andrew Jackson Downing, Frederick Law Olmsted or Edwin
Lutyens, among other notable landscape architects of the day, to
design and care for their lavish gardens.
</P>
<P>
   But many homeowners have since begun to find pleasure themselves
in the tasks of gardening.
</P>
<P>
   While that trend continues today, gardeners are often looking
for new conveniences while continuing to borrow landscaping ideas
from the past.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, buying new tools and other landscaping accessories is
part of the fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to start with the new gardening catalogs each year,
which are very helpful when doing research,'' said Cassandra Danz,
the ``Mrs. Greenthumbs'' of television fame. ``You can find just
about anything you need for gardening, from tools to compost bins
and plants to trees and shrubs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are also more garden tools now than ever before,'' Danz
said. ``One of the newer tools that I like very much is the
poacher's or garden spade, which you can find in most English
gardening catalogs or perhaps order it through a local garden
store. They are now pretty easy to find. This tool is good for
getting in and around plants in an established garden. You can use
it for planting bulbs and for weeding. It just pushes the weeds
right up.''
</P>
<P>
   Danz said that she also received a garden hoe as a gift, which
she likes using very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely sharp, almost like a weapon,'' she mused. ``I
never really hoe, but it's also good for getting rid of weeds,
especially from gravel paths.''
</P>
<P>
   Age is not an obstacle to the pleasures of planting. According
to a survey conducted by Ace Hardware at the Chicago Flower and
Garden Show in March, 54 percent of those polled who have young
children said the youngsters get involved as well, and 43 percent
of young gardeners have a special section of the garden set aside
just for them.
</P>
<P>
   But some adult chores, such as raking, can be back-breaking. To
that end, many garden centers carry a lighter-weight selection of
tools for women.
</P>
<P>
   A handy carry-around tool is the 7-inch folding pruning saw,
which cuts on the pull stroke and is good for green wood, hard,
dead and frozen limbs.
</P>
<P>
   There's actually a lot more these days of almost every kind of
tool, such as pruning shears, which come in every size.
</P>
<P>
   You can also get a pair of gardening gloves for every function
from those with a better grip to rose gloves with leather,
thorn-resistant palms and extra-long cuffs.
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning on planting more than two bulbs, consider the
long-handled bulb planter, which also comes in a few different
styles, for less than $20. With this hand tool, extracting the dirt
is easy, as you have only to push down on the scoop with your foot,
as you would with a shovel. Lift the scoop, drop the bulb in and
tap the soil out into the opening.
</P>
<P>
   If you suffer from arthritis or chronic joint pain, there are
ergonomically designed hand tools. Harmony catalog (800-869-3446)
features stainless-steel and latex-free BS plastic tools that keep
your hand and wrist in a neutral, stress-free position.
</P>
<P>
   The Fist Grip Trowel and Fist Grip Cultivator, which both sell
for $15, can be used for planting, weeding or potting. These also
help the gardener to use the arm, not just the wrist, offering
better leverage in tough soil.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have been out for a few years, foam pad knee
cushions now come in a variety of colors.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond tools, there are also architectural elements to add
interest to your gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Many garden centers sell metal obelisks that add an aged look,
as they already have a rusted patina. Use them as sculpture, a
focal point in the garden, or to grow climbing flowers and vines.
</P>
<P>
   Faux terra cotta pots in plastic look like the real thing, but
are 90 percent lighter than their clay counterparts. In addition,
these pots resist chipping and cracking in freezing weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the new light-weight containers, even the plastic
ones, look like Italian terra cotta from about 20 feet away,'' Danz
said. ``These big containers are really great, especially if you
ever want to lift it again and not pay $200 per pot. I wouldn't
want to pass the plastic ones every day going into my house, but if
you plant them with lush things trailing over the sides and/or dot
them with real terra cotta pots, nobody will ever be able to tell
the difference.''

ORPHEUS GETS DOWN

THE GROUND BENEATH HER FEET 
By Salman Rushdie. Holt. 
575 pp. $27.50. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, Orpheus, son of Calliope, you with your magic lyre and your
great lost love! Following his Eurydice to the underworld, he
brought her out again, only to have her snatched away at the last
moment. Composers and writers have plumbed the Greek myth for
centuries, finding there parables about the failure of art as well
as sheer inconsolable longing. But it takes a certain perverse
genius to transform the tragedy into a story about rock 'n' roll.
Not to mention irony: If a hipster Orpheus and his electric guitar
wind up in the mosh pit, how much worse can Hades really be?
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred by having a galaxy's worth of history to draw from,
Salman Rushdie has used his tale of Orpheus Descending as
scaffolding for an even wider novel: one that brazenly roams among
such subjects as the nature of tragedy, mass culture and celebrity,
global politics, photography, comparative religion, and the cosmic
significance of earthquakes. Replete with the surpluses of
intellect and fancy that define Rushdie's earlier fiction, ``The
Ground Beneath Her Feet'' very much wants to be Joycean in its
cantankerous reach _ a three-pound novel of exile that also manages
to be an ode to literature, a satirical political commentary, and,
of course, a love story. With the same geographical prowess of
Rushdie's earlier fiction, the work is sensate with the smells and
noises and overload ambience of both Bombay and New York. Its
challenges are so panoramic, so against the grain of contemporary
anti-epic fiction, that it will beg the usual Homeric adjectives
(brilliant and dazzling and so forth). Some of them are deserved.
But it should also be said that ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet'' can
be enervating in its unrelenting cleverness and tedious in its
wholesale erudition. It's a bit like having an internationally
renowned scholar seated next to you at a five-course dinner: At
first you're snowed, then you're captivated, and eventually _ when
you still don't know what makes the guy tick _ you just want to go
home, or at least take off your shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly the failings are ones of excess, and they're in direct
proportion to the gauziness of the novel's vast cast. A novelist of
ideas, Rushdie invents his characters not to understand them, but
to employ them: They become vehicles for his narrative journey,
flesh-and-blood manikins for his designs of thought and language.
This isn't necessarily a death-knell trait for a novelist to have
(George Eliot could succumb to something similar, though with
greater sympathy for her team of workers), but here it results in a
particular kind of novel, mind-stretching without being emotionally
engaging. In many ways, Rushdie's cerebral, fabulist fiction is the
loose and baggy monster of the modern age: In a post-tech world
where a war zone can be a ticket to celebrity and John Lennon is as
revered as Mother Teresa, how do you choose what to leave out?
</P>
<P>
   Given the nightmarish banality and false intimacy that now
define much of multimedia's reach, the Orpheus myth, with its
classical elements of doomed love and violent obsession, may be
ripe for resurrection. To refresh the story: Orpheus was a
god-gifted musician in love with Eurydice, who died from a
snakebite while fleeing the advances of Aristaeus. Orpheus pursued
her into Hades, where he charmed even the Furies, and sang and
bargained for Eurydice's return. The gods relented, under the
condition that he never look at his bride until they had safely
reemerged in the upper world. Fearing he had been tricked, Orpheus
glanced back at Eurydice in his last few steps, whereby she was
lost to him forever. He eschewed all other women, and was torn to
pieces for his abstinence in a bacchanalian revel.
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie has reinvented the myth through the viewpoint of
Aristaeus, who here is an Indian photographer called Rai, the
first-person narrator of the novel. ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet''
opens in 1989, when this Eurydice, a 44-year-old Greek-Indian rock
goddess named Vina Apsara, is killed in an earthquake in Mexico.
Rai has loved her since they were childhood friends in India; her
partner and soulmate, Ormus Cama, is a musical prodigy with a deep
shadow to his psyche _ his twin brother died in utero, then his
older brother tried to murder him. In pursuit of both Vina and
musical transcendence, Ormus has been blighted or blessed by his
occasional psychic trips to a parallel universe, that visa of
double vision having been provided by his dead twin. The real
world, where Vina and Rai and Ormus reside, is a place where
President Kennedy barely escaped a bullet in 1963, where Lou Reed
is a woman, and where the famous novelists of the age have names
like Yossarian and Stephen Dedalus.
</P>
<P>
   So: Reality itself is a fiction, in other words, and fiction _
the invention of a reality we can all agree on, even transiently _
may provide the greater truth. Casting about in this ``limbo of
lost possibilities,'' as Rai calls them, Rushdie has created a
multilayered world of exile and dualism, where Western myth and
Eastern religion are equally suspect (or at least populated by
martyred fools), where higher love is as cheap and ephemeral as
last year's rock lyrics. If all of history has been derailed and
the gods themselves are not to be trusted _ if yesterday's gone _
then maybe Einstein was even more right than he knew: The
space-time continuum really is the last frontier, the only place
left to put your faith.
</P>
<P>
   Poor doomed Ormus, with his round-trip rail pass to the other
side, experiences rather than knows this idea; that task of
understanding will be left to Rai, who can create or defy reality
simply by photographing it, and who (as Rushdie's doppelganger)
will be the ghostly synthesizer who ties the story together.
Assuming that the center cannot hold, as this seismic disaster tale
repeatedly insists, rock 'n' roll is the rough beast being beamed
onto screens across the planet: Vina the ``exaggerated avatar'' of
mass confusion, her beauty and trouble and soul-baring to the beat
a way to make people feel. Rai's name means ``hope,'' which, one
assumes, is supposed to offer some relief, though his double
exposure as a man with a camera has, he tells us, compromised him
irreparably.
</P>
<P>
   Rai's confession of his own fatal flaw comes halfway through
``The Ground Beneath Her Feet,'' and Rushdie's treatment of it
suggests the greater problems with the novel. He has wrapped Rai's
relaying of his darkest hour within a long allusion to Molly
Bloom's soliloquy at the end of ``Ulysses,'' which _ with its
triumphant close of ``yes I said yes I will Yes'' _ is surely the
greatest last-gasp affirmation in all Western literature. That
Rushdie has used it here to describe a fallen man's revelation
feels despairing, even nihilistic. If this was supposed to be a
post-Joycean commentary on the state of the planet or the death of
hope, it nonetheless has the effect of trashing the altar to
complain about the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Swirling with puns and allusions, ``The Ground Beneath Her
Feet'' is Rushdie's own novel of exile and alienation, his love
triangle cursed by the sins of the past and hellbent on repeating
them. He has delivered a disheveled epic about the lethal victories
of contemporary culture, where East and West have traded their most
dangerous weapons _ from rock music to religion _ and thereby
doubled their arsenals, with each emerging the stronger and the
worse for the trade. For all the interpretations of the Orpheus
myth over the centuries, the one that seems to me the most enduring
is Orpheus's ultimate inability to put his faith in the gods. The
only unequivocally holy truth, for Rai, is ``the willing,
disbelieving belief of the reader in the well-told tale.'' That
seems to be Rushdie's Grail as well, and it's offered here as a
coda of half light, amid the suffering, madness, and horrifying
comedy that modernity ensures.

INFINITE LOOP 
How Apple, the World's Most Insanely Great Computer Company, Went
Insane 
By Michael S. Malone 
Currency/Doubleday, 597 pp., $27.50 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another book about Apple Computer? You bet. And it's no use
pretending you've lost interest in Silicon Valley's longest running
soap opera. The extraordinary success of Apple's comeback product,
the iMac, proves otherwise. What other company could put a mediocre
computer in a pretty blue box, charge $200 more than it's worth,
yet have people lining up to buy it?
</P>
<P>
   A great many of those iMac sales were purchases of the heart,
having more to do with aesthetic and emotional appeal than
megahertz and megabytes. It's always been that way with Apple
Computer. No other American business, except perhaps Walt Disney
Co, has ever formed such an enduring bond of love with its
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Which is especially striking when you consider the thoroughly
unpleasant people who built Apple into a great corporation and
nearly destroyed it. It's fashionable to sneer at the rapacious
ambition of Bill Gates. But Michael Malone's new book reminds us
that Apple's creators and leaders are as greedy and domineering as
Microsoft's _ just not as good at it.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the material here is familiar, but it's highlighted by
Malone's deep understanding of the technical and commercial aspects
of the industry. He's especially good in the early part of the
book, retelling the story of the Two Steves _ Apple's technical
genius, Steve Wozniak, and master entrepreneur Steve Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that Wozniak was the technical brains of the
outfit, but Malone reminds us of just how brilliant he was.
Nowadays we're accustomed to portable computers, and so it's hard
to remember what a dramatic effort it took to condense all the
functions of a room-sized mainframe onto a single circuit board. At
IBM, it took a crack team of engineers to do it with the company's
original PC. Wozniak did it almost entirely alone, and wrote
software for the original Apple I machine to boot. By rights, ``The
Woz'' ought to be remembered as one of the great inventors of our
times.
</P>
<P>
   But it wouldn't have meant a thing if not for Jobs _ arrogant,
undisciplined, ignorant, but a quick learner possessed of blazing
ambition. An instinctive businessman, Jobs knew what it would take
to make Apple a success. He needed working capital, a solid
management team, and above all, a unique, user-friendly sense of
style that would attract customers who'd never dared to approach a
computer before. Jobs knew what he needed, and he made it all
happen. Indeed, Malone makes a good case that Jobs, not Wozniak, is
Apple's truly indispensable man. After all, if Jobs hadn't found
Wozniak, he would almost certainly have latched onto some other
genius and built some other remarkable firm.
</P>
<P>
   The early period of Apple _ its founding, the introduction of
the hugely popular Apple II, and the birth of the Macintosh _ is
the period that established the firm's reputation and management
style for all time. Which is too bad, because for all its technical
and stylistic excellence, Apple became a profoundly dysfunctional
place. Much of the blame goes to Jobs, an abusive and inconsistent
leader who introduced bitter divisions in the firm that would never
entirely heal. He also introduced Pepsi-Cola chief executive John
Sculley, who proceeded to purge Jobs from the company he'd founded.
</P>
<P>
   Sculley was ambitious all right, and ruthless. But not ruthless
enough. He lacked the nerve to license the Mac's remarkable
software to other computer makers _ a policy that could have
established Apple, not Microsoft, as the world's leading software
company. Besides, with Jobs gone, so was the magic, and Apple was
destined to spend the next 15 years in search of its lost vision.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the second half of the book is a tragic but
familiar recital of Apple's wanderings in the wilderness. All the
horror stories are here, right up to what was arguably the most
appalling: the project to devise a version of the Macintosh
operating system that could run on a standard Microsoft-type PC.
The project succeeded, but Apple decided not to bring the software
to market. The decision meant a wide-open playing field for
Microsoft's Windows 95 software. It also meant that the battle for
domination of desktop computer software was over forever.
</P>
<P>
   Malone tells this part of the story at considerable length but
in an almost perfunctory fashion. One gets the feeling that Malone
began his work at a time when he and nearly everybody else expected
Apple's imminent demise. Otherwise, it's hard to explain why Malone
gives such very short shrift to Apple's extraordinary comeback, led
by the resurrected Steve Jobs. Especially in its latter chapters,
Malone leaves you feeling that there's a great deal more of the
Apple story waiting to be told. Surely enough for at least one more
Apple book.

   Outside the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla,
Calif., the sights, sounds and smells are all of a seaside
paradise. Inside, in biologist William Fenical's lab, it's good-bye
to the sea's charms and hello to the disgusting and fascinating
world of creatures scooped from that ocean outside, ground up and
thrown at every frightening disease Fenical can think of.
</P>
<P>
   This is the medicine chest of the next millennium _ agar-filled
dishes, flasks full of brown nutrient broth and beakers bubbling
like omelets in hell's kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   What's brewing in these potent pots? Stews of fungi and bacteria
that once lived in ocean sediments, rotting driftwood, weeds,
coral, sponges and grasses. Any one of these containers might
harbor a brand-new cancer drug or a compound to wipe out some of
the scariest viruses known to humankind.
</P>
<P>
   With the glory days of antibiotics over, Fenical's quest may be
critical to the future of medicine. Bacterium after bacterium is
gaining resistance to our arsenal. Doctors are desperate for
compounds to attack cancer, Alzheimer's, AIDS and a long list of
other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Since that momentous day in 1928 when Alexander Fleming
discovered penicillin, researchers have been looking in
increasingly exotic locations for the next strain of antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical's answer is surprisingly simple: Search the sea. Since
the 1980s he has been plunging into the ocean to find the next wave
of medicines. Already he and his colleagues have dredged up some
promising candidates: chemicals that soothe swelling, a compound
from a yellow soft coral that disrupts cell division in cancer
cells and virus-killing proteins from ocean molds that live in sea
grasses.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical is not alone in this effort. Today the list of novel
potential anticancer drugs at the National Cancer Institute's
Natural Products Branch includes more candidates from the ocean
than from the land. Several promising drugs from the sea that might
be used to treat leukemia _ including one from a creature called
Bugula, which clings to the bottoms of boats _ are involved in
human trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ocean is by far the major habitat on the planet _ it's 70
percent of Earth's surface,'' Fenical explains. ``It's teeming with
unique organisms. More than half the organisms in the ocean don't
even occur on land.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news. The bad news is that it's difficult to
know just where to look. When it comes to marine life, the rich
history of ethnomedicine provides hardly any clues. Still, Fenical
and his colleagues have come up with strategies to narrow their
search.
</P>
<P>
   The first strategy is to go to a place where life is diverse and
concentrated, such as a reef in the Caribbean. An environment rich
in sea life is more likely to yield varied specimens.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical suspects that creatures loaded with biologically active
molecules _ the kind that they'd need to defend themselves
chemically _ could be the richest sources for all manner of drugs.
Take the strange case of a glorious feathery sea fan called
Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put a bit of tuna out on the reef, fish come from
everywhere, and it's gone,'' Fenical says. ``But if I grind up this
animal and mix in some extract with the tuna, the fish will come
up, take one bite and go `Yuck!' No way will they eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the sea fan's chemical arsenal is a family of molecules
called pseudopterosins which do more than make fish want to barf.
In people, they soothe swelling caused by sunburn or chemical
irritants. They do so by reining in a key enzyme involved in
inflammation, and they do it with more clout than does
hydrocortisone.
</P>
<P>
   Psoriasis, sunburn and arthritis all involve inflammation, and
one or more of the pseudopterosins might one day be the drug of
choice to treat these afflictions.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical reckons that a sea fan extract might also be great as an
additive to toothpaste or for soothing inflamed gums. The extract
is already being added to cosmetics like face creams. Of course,
the hope is to hit the jackpot with far stronger drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a potential cancer killer, the trick is to ferret
out drugs that kill a range of cancer cells but leave healthy cells
unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the compound must be purified, its molecular structure
determined and either a drug company or the National Cancer
Institute has to decide to fund testing on animals. Finally, the
drug must be tested on people.
</P>
<P>
   At any stage, testing may be dropped _ for reasons as simple as
the drug's being either too toxic or too weak.
</P>
<P>
   Although that outcome is common in the drug development
business, Fenical is excited about a substance he discovered
several years ago, called eleutherobin, in a remote shallow sea off
the coast of Australia. It comes from a mottled yellow
pickle-shaped soft coral.
</P>
<P>
   Eleutherobin stops malignant tumors from growing in much the
same way taxol does, by binding to a protein called tubulin and
disrupting cell division.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing nemesis of experimenting with sea drugs is supply
_ getting enough material to test, let alone produce, a drug. In
many cases, it's simply too hard to make a drug from scratch. The
chemistry is too complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Microbes can be grown in vats if researchers can figure out what
to feed them, but other substances can prove more daunting to
reproduce. When researchers became interested in halichondrin B, a
promising anticancer chemical from a sponge fondly known as
``yellow slimy,'' they had to collect a whole metric ton of sponges
to derive 300 milligrams of drug _ the amount needed to begin
preliminary trials.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, The National Cancer Institute put out a call to
marine biologists and word came back that the sponge thrives off
the coast of New Zealand. Now researchers are trying to farm the
sponge in Wellington Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent progress, no marine drug has reached the
pharmacy shelf. But Fenical is not discouraged. In fact, he is
passionate about the possibilities: ``If we need new drugs, where
are we going to go? Space? No.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses and waves his hand expansively out the window toward
the wide blue Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sitting right there. It's diverse as hell. And it's
waiting for us.''

business, Fenical is excited about a substance he discovered
several years ago, called eleutherobin, in a remote shallow sea off
the coast of Australia. It comes from a mottled yellow
pickle-shaped soft coral.
</P>
<P>
   Eleutherobin stops malignant tumors from growing in much the
same way taxol does, by binding to a protein called tubulin and
disrupting cell division.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing nemesis of experimenting with sea drugs is supply
_ getting enough material to test, let alone produce, a drug. In
many cases, it's simply too hard to make a drug from scratch. The
chemistry is too complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Microbes can be grown in vats if researchers can figure out what
to feed them, but other substances can prove more daunting to
reproduce. When researchers became interested in halichondrin B, a
promising anticancer chemical from a sponge fondly known as
``yellow slimy,'' they had to collect a whole metric ton of sponges
to derive 300 milligrams of drug _ the amount needed to begin
preliminary trials.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, The National Cancer Institute put out a call to
marine biologists and word came back that the sponge thrives off
the coast of New Zealand. Now researchers are trying to farm the
sponge in Wellington Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent progress, no marine drug has reached the
pharmacy shelf. But Fenical is not discouraged. In fact, he is
passionate about the possibilities: ``If we need new drugs, where
are we going to go? Space? No.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses and waves his hand expansively out the window toward
the wide blue Pacific.
</P>

   &UR; THE DRACULA SYNDROME &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neurologist Juan Gomez-Alonso has formulated an unusual medical
hypothesis, an explanation for the origin of vampire legends.
Stories of lusty, bloodthirsty vampires, says Gomez-Alonso, who
works at Xeral Hospital in Vigo, Spain, may have been inspired by
people suffering from rabies.
</P>
<P>
   He traces the connection to a rabies outbreak in central Europe
in the early 18th century, not long before stories of vampires
began circulating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the symptoms, such as aggressiveness and
hypersexuality, would not have been seen as manifestations of a
disease,'' he says. ``Uneducated people could have thought all this
was the work of a malign being. Moreover, the bizarre rejection of
some stimuli _ odors, light, water and mirrors _ shown by rabid
humans must have been quite puzzling.''
</P>
<P>
   What's next for Gomez-Alonso, werewolves? As it happens, yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A connection between rabies and the development of the
werewolf legend could be hypothesized.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEXT: ROCKETS AT O'HARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The space shuttle and its rockets are huge _ some 4.5 million
pounds at liftoff. About 85 percent of that weight is fuel.
Designed to work in a vacuum, the shuttle must carry not only fuel
but the oxygen to burn it. Because this is an inefficient way to
go, NASA engineers have recently tested an engine that gets some of
its oxygen on the run. Uwe Hueter of the Marshall Space Flight
Center in Huntsville, Ala., says the engine could cut takeoff
weights in half.
</P>
<P>
   A spacecraft equipped with this engine would take off like a
rocket, Hueter says. But within minutes, incoming air would begin
to supplement liquid oxygen. Once the space craft hit 1,500 miles
per hour _ twice the speed of sound _ the liquid oxygen would shut
off completely and the engine would burn fuel mixed with air.
Operating like a ramjet, the craft would accelerate to about 10
times the speed of sound. When the air got too thin for the engine
to breathe, the ship would shift back to rocket mode to punch its
way into space.
</P>
<P>
   Recent wind-tunnel tests of the idea were a smashing success,
says Hunter, who plans flight tests in about four years. In the
long run _ about 15 years hence _ Hunter hopes the engine will be
matched with advanced materials under development at NASA to create
a vehicle nearly as inexpensive as a jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vision is that this would be a horizontal takeoff and
horizontal lander,'' he says. ``If we can keep the weight below a
million pounds, which is about what a 747 weighs, we could even use
existing airports.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HAWKING'S VISION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His body may be confined to a wheelchair, but the mind of
Stephen Hawking soars, grappling with the most profound mysteries
of the universe, from the birth and death of black holes to the
fate of the cosmos itself.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy A. Svitil, an editor for Discover magazine, recently
interviewed Hawking after he talked to a packed auditorium in San
Jose, Calif., about the future of science. The theoretical
physicist predicted the development of intelligent, self-aware
computers that could match the human brain, not to mention space
travel well beyond this solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Svitil asked: What are the biggest unsolved problems in physics
today?
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory of everything,'' Hawking said _ the name physicists
give to the undiscovered laws that would unite all theories about
the universe, from quantum mechanics to Einstein's general theory
of relativity. ``We feel that we are near, but we never get there.
It always seems just over the rainbow's edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties scientists face in tackling the
all-in-one theory, Hawking is certain the answer will come soon:
``My money is on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another enigma, he said, is ``understanding the origin of the
universe and why it produced the universe that we see.'' Too many
theories, he suggests, explain some of the things we see in nature,
but they can't be applied to all conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cosmology is not science if it does not produce theories with
predictions that agree with what we observe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Svitil asked what Hawking thought of John Horgan's
recent book, ``The End of Science,'' in which the author argues
that all the fundamental problems of science have been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking likes to give succinct answers because he is disabled by
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis _ Lou Gehrig's disease _ and must
communicate by spelling out his words on a computer. His reply?
</P>
<P>
   ``Garbage.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Outside the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla,
Calif., the sights, sounds and smells are all of a seaside
paradise. Inside, in biologist William Fenical's lab, it's good-bye
to the sea's charms and hello to the disgusting and fascinating
world of creatures scooped from that ocean outside, ground up and
thrown at every frightening disease Fenical can think of.
</P>
<P>
   This is the medicine chest of the next millennium _ agar-filled
dishes, flasks full of brown nutrient broth and beakers bubbling
like omelets in hell's kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   What's brewing in these potent pots? Stews of fungi and bacteria
that once lived in ocean sediments, rotting driftwood, weeds,
coral, sponges and grasses. Any one of these containers might
harbor a brand-new cancer drug or a compound to wipe out some of
the scariest viruses known to humankind.
</P>
<P>
   With the glory days of antibiotics over, Fenical's quest may be
critical to the future of medicine. Bacterium after bacterium is
gaining resistance to our arsenal. Doctors are desperate for
compounds to attack cancer, Alzheimer's, AIDS and a long list of
other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Since that momentous day in 1928 when Alexander Fleming
discovered penicillin, researchers have been looking in
increasingly exotic locations for the next strain of antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical's answer is surprisingly simple: Search the sea. Since
the 1980s he has been plunging into the ocean to find the next wave
of medicines. Already he and his colleagues have dredged up some
promising candidates: chemicals that soothe swelling, a compound
from a yellow soft coral that disrupts cell division in cancer
cells and virus-killing proteins from ocean molds that live in sea
grasses.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical is not alone in this effort. Today the list of novel
potential anticancer drugs at the National Cancer Institute's
Natural Products Branch includes more candidates from the ocean
than from the land. Several promising drugs from the sea that might
be used to treat leukemia _ including one from a creature called
Bugula, which clings to the bottoms of boats _ are involved in
human trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ocean is by far the major habitat on the planet _ it's 70
percent of Earth's surface,'' Fenical explains. ``It's teeming with
unique organisms. More than half the organisms in the ocean don't
even occur on land.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news. The bad news is that it's difficult to
know just where to look. When it comes to marine life, the rich
history of ethnomedicine provides hardly any clues. Still, Fenical
and his colleagues have come up with strategies to narrow their
search.
</P>
<P>
   The first strategy is to go to a place where life is diverse and
concentrated, such as a reef in the Caribbean. An environment rich
in sea life is more likely to yield varied specimens.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical suspects that creatures loaded with biologically active
molecules _ the kind that they'd need to defend themselves
chemically _ could be the richest sources for all manner of drugs.
Take the strange case of a glorious feathery sea fan called
Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put a bit of tuna out on the reef, fish come from
everywhere, and it's gone,'' Fenical says. ``But if I grind up this
animal and mix in some extract with the tuna, the fish will come
up, take one bite and go `Yuck!' No way will they eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the sea fan's chemical arsenal is a family of molecules
called pseudopterosins which do more than make fish want to barf.
In people, they soothe swelling caused by sunburn or chemical
irritants. They do so by reining in a key enzyme involved in
inflammation, and they do it with more clout than does
hydrocortisone.
</P>
<P>
   Psoriasis, sunburn and arthritis all involve inflammation, and
one or more of the pseudopterosins might one day be the drug of
choice to treat these afflictions.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical reckons that a sea fan extract might also be great as an
additive to toothpaste or for soothing inflamed gums. The extract
is already being added to cosmetics like face creams. Of course,
the hope is to hit the jackpot with far stronger drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a potential cancer killer, the trick is to ferret
out drugs that kill a range of cancer cells but leave healthy cells
unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the compound must be purified, its molecular structure
determined and either a drug company or the National Cancer
Institute has to decide to fund testing on animals. Finally, the
drug must be tested on people.
</P>
<P>
   At any stage, testing may be dropped _ for reasons as simple as
the drug's being either too toxic or too weak.
</P>
<P>
   Although that outcome is common in the drug development
business, Fenical is excited about a substance he discovered
several years ago, called eleutherobin, in a remote shallow sea off
the coast of Australia. It comes from a mottled yellow
pickle-shaped soft coral.
</P>
<P>
   Eleutherobin stops malignant tumors from growing in much the
same way taxol does, by binding to a protein called tubulin and
disrupting cell division.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing nemesis of experimenting with sea drugs is supply
_ getting enough material to test, let alone produce, a drug. In
many cases, it's simply too hard to make a drug from scratch. The
chemistry is too complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Microbes can be grown in vats if researchers can figure out what
to feed them, but other substances can prove more daunting to
reproduce. When researchers became interested in halichondrin B, a
promising anticancer chemical from a sponge fondly known as
``yellow slimy,'' they had to collect a whole metric ton of sponges
to derive 300 milligrams of drug _ the amount needed to begin
preliminary trials.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, The National Cancer Institute put out a call to
marine biologists and word came back that the sponge thrives off
the coast of New Zealand. Now researchers are trying to farm the
sponge in Wellington Harbor.

pharmacy shelf. But Fenical is not discouraged. In fact, he is

</P>
<P>
   Fenical suspects that creatures loaded with biologically active
molecules _ the kind that they'd need to defend themselves
chemically _ could be the richest sources for all manner of drugs.
Take the strange case of a glorious feathery sea fan called
Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put a bit of tuna out on the reef, fish come from
everywhere, and it's gone,'' Fenical says. ``But if I grind up this
animal and mix in some extract with the tuna, the fish will come
up, take one bite and go `Yuck!' No way will they eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the sea fan's chemical arsenal is a family of molecules
called pseudopterosins which do more than make fish want to barf.
In people, they soothe swelling caused by sunburn or chemical
irritants. They do so by reining in a key enzyme involved in
inflammation, and they do it with more clout than does
hydrocortisone.
</P>
<P>
   Psoriasis, sunburn and arthritis all involve inflammation, and
one or more of the pseudopterosins might one day be the drug of
choice to treat these afflictions.
</P>
<P>
   Fenical reckons that a sea fan extract might also be great as an
additive to toothpaste or for soothing inflamed gums. The extract
is already being added to cosmetics like face creams. Of course,
the hope is to hit the jackpot with far stronger drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a potential cancer killer, the trick is to ferret
out drugs that kill a range of cancer cells but leave healthy cells
unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the compound must be purified, its molecular structure
determined and either a drug company or the National Cancer
Institute has to decide to fund testing on animals. Finally, the
drug must be tested on people.
</P>
<P>
   At any stage, testing may be dropped _ for reasons as simple as
the drug's being either too toxic or too weak.
</P>
<P>
   Although that outcome is common in the drug development
business, Fenical is excited about a substance he discovered
several years ago, called eleutherobin, in a remote shallow sea off
the coast of Australia. It comes from a mottled yellow
pickle-shaped soft coral.
</P>
<P>
   Eleutherobin stops malignant tumors from growing in much the
same way taxol does, by binding to a protein called tubulin and
disrupting cell division.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing nemesis of experimenting with sea drugs is supply
_ getting enough material to test, let alone produce, a drug. In
many cases, it's simply too hard to make a drug from scratch. The
chemistry is too complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Microbes can be grown in vats if researchers can figure out what
to feed them, but other substances can prove more daunting to
reproduce. When researchers became interested in halichondrin B, a
promising anticancer chemical from a sponge fondly known as
``yellow slimy,'' they had to collect a whole metric ton of sponges
to derive 300 milligrams of drug _ the amount needed to begin
preliminary trials.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, The National Cancer Institute put out a call to
marine biologists and word came back that the sponge thrives off
the coast of New Zealand. Now researchers are trying to farm the
sponge in Wellington Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent progress, no marine drug has reached the
pharmacy shelf. But Fenical is not discouraged. In fact, he is
passionate about the possibilities: ``If we need new drugs, where
are we going to go? Space? No.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses and waves his hand expansively out the window toward
the wide blue Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sitting right there. It's diverse as hell. And it's
waiting for us.''

   &UR; THE DRACULA SYNDROME &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neurologist Juan Gomez-Alonso has formulated an unusual medical
hypothesis, an explanation for the origin of vampire legends.
Stories of lusty, bloodthirsty vampires, says Gomez-Alonso, who
works at Xeral Hospital in Vigo, Spain, may have been inspired by
people suffering from rabies.
</P>
<P>
   He traces the connection to a rabies outbreak in central Europe
in the early 18th century, not long before stories of vampires
began circulating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the symptoms, such as aggressiveness and
hypersexuality, would not have been seen as manifestations of a
disease,'' he says. ``Uneducated people could have thought all this
was the work of a malign being. Moreover, the bizarre rejection of
some stimuli _ odors, light, water and mirrors _ shown by rabid
humans must have been quite puzzling.''
</P>
<P>
   What's next for Gomez-Alonso, werewolves? As it happens, yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A connection between rabies and the development of the
werewolf legend could be hypothesized.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEXT: ROCKETS AT O'HARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The space shuttle and its rockets are huge _ some 4.5 million
pounds at liftoff. About 85 percent of that weight is fuel.
Designed to work in a vacuum, the shuttle must carry not only fuel
but the oxygen to burn it. Because this is an inefficient way to
go, NASA engineers have recently tested an engine that gets some of
its oxygen on the run. Uwe Hueter of the Marshall Space Flight
Center in Huntsville, Ala., says the engine could cut takeoff
weights in half.
</P>
<P>
   A spacecraft equipped with this engine would take off like a
rocket, Hueter says. But within minutes, incoming air would begin
to supplement liquid oxygen. Once the space craft hit 1,500 miles
per hour _ twice the speed of sound _ the liquid oxygen would shut
off completely and the engine would burn fuel mixed with air.
Operating like a ramjet, the craft would accelerate to about 10
times the speed of sound. When the air got too thin for the engine
to breathe, the ship would shift back to rocket mode to punch its
way into space.
</P>
<P>
   Recent wind-tunnel tests of the idea were a smashing success,
says Hunter, who plans flight tests in about four years. In the
long run _ about 15 years hence _ Hunter hopes the engine will be
matched with advanced materials under development at NASA to create
a vehicle nearly as inexpensive as a jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vision is that this would be a horizontal takeoff and
horizontal lander,'' he says. ``If we can keep the weight below a
million pounds, which is about what a 747 weighs, we could even use
existing airports.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HAWKING'S VISION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His body may be confined to a wheelchair, but the mind of
Stephen Hawking soars, grappling with the most profound mysteries
of the universe, from the birth and death of black holes to the
fate of the cosmos itself.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy A. Svitil, an editor for Discover magazine, recently
interviewed Hawking after he talked to a packed auditorium in San
Jose, Calif., about the future of science. The theoretical
physicist predicted the development of intelligent, self-aware
computers that could match the human brain, not to mention space
travel well beyond this solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Svitil asked: What are the biggest unsolved problems in physics
today?
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory of everything,'' Hawking said _ the name physicists
give to the undiscovered laws that would unite all theories about
the universe, from quantum mechanics to Einstein's general theory
of relativity. ``We feel that we are near, but we never get there.
It always seems just over the rainbow's edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties scientists face in tackling the
all-in-one theory, Hawking is certain the answer will come soon:
``My money is on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another enigma, he said, is ``understanding the origin of the
universe and why it produced the universe that we see.'' Too many
theories, he suggests, explain some of the things we see in nature,
but they can't be applied to all conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cosmology is not science if it does not produce theories with
predictions that agree with what we observe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Svitil asked what Hawking thought of John Horgan's
recent book, ``The End of Science,'' in which the author argues
that all the fundamental problems of science have been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking likes to give succinct answers because he is disabled by
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis _ Lou Gehrig's disease _ and must
communicate by spelling out his words on a computer. His reply?
</P>
<P>
   ``Garbage.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Burning up the grocery aisles
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Walking the aisles of the supermarket, humming
an old song, ``If I Only Had a Match.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you remember it. Maybe not. Frank Sinatra did a version
way back when he was recording for Columbia, early 1950s or before.
</P>
<P>
   Something like this ...
</P>
<P>
   If I only had a match, I could have a cigarette, if I only had a
cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   But if I did have a cigarette, I could watch the smoke curl and
think about my girl, if I only had a girl.
</P>
<P>
   But if I did have a girl, we could get married and live happily
ever after.
</P>
<P>
   If I only had a match.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that I was looking for matches.
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine, being out of matches?
</P>
<P>
   I'd turned the house and most every drawer in it upside down the
night before looking for a match. So I could light the gas logs in
the fireplace. So my teeth wouldn't chatter.
</P>
<P>
   If I only had a match.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody runs out of matches. I'd run out of matches.
</P>
<P>
   You don't know how hard it is to find a match until you need a
match.
</P>
<P>
   All those signs in a supermarket from one aisle to the next:
</P>
<P>
   Canned goods ... Sugar ... Snacks ... Baby food ... You name it
...
</P>
<P>
   On and on, but not one mention of matches.
</P>
<P>
   So I'm going up one aisle and down another, pushing a buggy just
in case I see something else I need.
</P>
<P>
   A man can go broke going up and down supermarket aisles, buying
stuff he sees that he needs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I could have asked. But ...
</P>
<P>
   It's a man thing. You don't ask for directions when you're
driving your car. You don't ask for directions when you're pushing
your buggy.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I figured it out. Barbecue. Charcoal. Matches. You got
one, you gotta have the other.
</P>
<P>
   Where do you find charcoal? I'm closest to the meat department
so I check with the meat department.
</P>
<P>
   A nice lady working behind the meat counter is talking to a man
wearing a tie and a name plate. Figure him for the manager,
especially the way the conversation is going.
</P>
<P>
   She's doing all the talking, all about how Memorial Day weekend
is coming up, and how they'd planned so long, and it was her
husband's 30th birthday ...
</P>
<P>
   She stops in mid-sentence. Customers can have that effect on
employees when their manager is standing there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matches?''
</P>
<P>
   ``With the paper products,'' she suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, an aisle over,'' the manager says.
</P>
<P>
   He adds, ``Come on, I'll show you.''
</P>
<P>
   I think he was glad for the excuse to get away. Employees can
have that effect on their managers.
</P>
<P>
   Not in paper products. Not on the next aisle either. Finally, we
find matches. They're with the barbecue supplies. That's what I get
for asking.
</P>
<P>
   Only _ can you believe it? _ the supermarket has run out of
matches, too, leastwise the big boxes of kitchen matches like I
need to light the gas.
</P>
<P>
   All that's left on the shelf are those little penny boxes of
matches that cost heaven knows how much nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   The manager goes to check with the stock boy. No luck. Matches
are on order.
</P>
<P>
   So instead I end up buying a fire gun, if that's what you call
it. Anyway, that's what it looks like:
</P>
<P>
   A small pistol with a long, slender barrel. You pull the trigger
and, Pop!, the end lights up. A bargain at $3.99. Never have to buy
a match again, leastwise not until this thing runs out of whatever
fires it up.
</P>
<P>
   I check out. Total bill, what with all the stuff I found I
needed while pushing the buggy up and down the aisles, $70.44.
</P>
<P>
   Which would have bought a whole lot of penny boxes of matches,
regardless what they cost.
</P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A funereal contrast in athletes
 &HT;    (For release April 21, 1999. Moving on commentary and sports
wires.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The weather was cool by Miami standards, overcast and
generally depressing. My wife was holed up in the front bedroom,
battling a strep throat and not wanting any company. It was just me
and the TV set.
</P>
<P>
   Following the repetitive litany of those Sunday morning talking
head programs in which every expert on the Kosovo situation seems
to be saying the right thing until the next expert comes on the
screen and says something different, there was the choice of old
movies, infomercials or sports.
</P>
<P>
   The great hockey player Wayne Gretzky was retiring Sunday, and
it was the second day of the professional football draft. With both
on TV, it was an opportunity to surf between them.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast became remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   As Gretzky skated around the ice to appreciative cheers in New
York City's Madison Square Garden, just several floors below _ the
same building, mind you _ the National Football League was dividing
up the last hundred or so prospects for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky epitomizes everything we want in a sports hero: talent,
modesty, family, gratefulness. He's a person I wish I could say is
the embodiment of an all-American hero, but he's Canadian; he's an
all-Canadian hero. How fortunate for Canada!
</P>
<P>
   When the network broke for a commercial, I switched over to the
draft just in time to see the Miami Dolphins select a running back
who has been kicked off teams at two colleges, has failed three
drug tests, has recently pleaded guilty to two counts of
unauthorized entry and two counts of simple assault, has five years
of suspended jail time, is on four years' probation, requires
weekly drug testing and periodic counseling, must make good on a
$2,500 debt owed to a battered women's shelter, is not allowed to
have any contact with his victims and is banned from walking onto
the Louisiana State University campus.
</P>
<P>
   So who would you rather have baby-sitting your kids, Wayne
Gretzky or Cecil Collins, a.k.a. Cecil the Diesel?
</P>
<P>
   The two represent the polar caps of the sports world.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, of course, never needed another chance; he didn't flub
the first one. But men like Collins and Darryl Strawberry _ another
sad sports story of last week _ constantly are being awarded an
opportunity to fall astray again, and be paid handsomely as well.
</P>
<P>
   I kept pushing the remote. There was Gretzky with his wife and
kids, his old teammates, the greats he played against _ all
admiring each other, the fans holding up signs thanking the great
athlete for his 20 years of professional hockey.
</P>
<P>
   And there was Jimmy Johnson, the coach of the Miami Dolphins,
defending his selection of Collins _ saying he had great football
potential and should have another chance. When the draft shifted to
the studio analysts, an interesting question was put to Marty
Schottenheimer, a former quality NFL coach: ``Should a football
coach be responsible for the conduct of his players both on and off
the field?''
</P>
<P>
   After hedging a bit, Schottenheimer agreed that the coach does
share a significant degree of responsibility. Last year, Johnson
brought another bad seed into the Dolphins camp, a running back
(and woman abuser) named Lawrence Phillips, who had unceremoniously
been booted from another NFL team for his failings both as a player
and a human being. Johnson gave Phillips another chance; he blew it
in a bar near Fort Lauderdale, another woman roughed up.
</P>
<P>
   He's now playing in the European league; someone gave him
another chance again. I'm all for giving a guy another chance, but
how many is ``another''?
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the afternoon, I stayed with Gretzky as he
played his final game. Often, my eyes turned misty when I thought
of what he has brought to the troubled world of sport and how we
will _ and should _ cherish this humble, great athlete.
</P>
<P>
   And then I thought of Collins; but just for a second, because
compared to Gretzky, that's all he was worth.

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ Originally First Lady Hillary
Clinton was picked on for being bossy, brassy and too brainy. Now
she's being scoffed at for planning to write a book about

inappropriate for a putative U.S. Senate candidate. This is silly.
The female Clinton has never been one-dimensional. By MARIANNE

<TEXT>
<P>
   The bombing of Serbia has spread a deep _ and perhaps
long-lasting _ chill over NATO's relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The West's hoped-for, bear-hugging strategic partnership with a
newly democratic Russia gave way pretty quickly to one of a
pricklier sort: a readiness to agree where they could, but to
disagree openly and at times bad-temperedly where they couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   By now that air of intermittent iciness seems to have turned
into a veritable blizzard of dispute: from the war in Bosnia to the
handling of Iraq, from NATO's inclusion of Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary as new members, to be sealed ceremonially at
the alliance's summit in Washington on April 23, to the conflict
over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   This time the chill seems both deeper and more dangerous.
President Yeltsin has not only barked his hostility to NATO's air
and missile strikes, he is sending Russian intelligence-gathering
ships to the Adriatic, he may have hinted that his nuclear missiles
could be retargeted at NATO cities.
</P>
<P>
   He has also said that the use of NATO troops in Kosovo to end
Serb attacks on the mostly Muslim population could even turn a
potential cold war hot by drawing Russia into the fighting on
Serbia's side, possibly provoking a wider conflict in Europe or
even a ``third world war.''
</P>
<P>
   An alarming prospect. But, barring great stupidity on both
sides, not a likely one.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Russians are deeply unhappy at seeing fellow Slavs
being bombed by a military alliance that within shortish memory was
the old Soviet Union's implacable foe.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's leaders, already scrapping amongst themselves even
before Kosovo about how deliberately anti-western Russia's foreign
policy should be, felt slighted by NATO's decision to use force
over their firm objection.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing NATO soldiers on the ground in Kosovo _ a province of
Serbia _ would be an even greater affront to Russian dignity.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason, though not the only one, why NATO is hoping,
perhaps vainly, that air power alone can persuade Serbia's Slobodan
Milosevic to end his reign of terror in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For all the rhetoric, so far Russia has said it will not
intervene, or supply weapons to the Serbs. Yet this is the most
destructive row between Russia and the West since Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   It also coincides with two other events that in Russian eyes
only underline how this former superpower has fallen on hard times.
</P>
<P>
   One is next week's NATO summit, which might have effected a bit
of a public reconciliation with Russia, but which is now being
taken in Moscow as salt to new diplomatic wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The other is a deal-in-the-making on new IMF loans for Russia:
as much as they need the cash, many Russians hate to be seen going
cap in hand to foreigners again.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed those foreigners should be cautious over any new loans
until Russia has carried out reforms that would make the money work
better for recovery _ a point that it is to be hoped will not be
overlooked in the face of more Russian bad temper at this delicate
moment.
</P>
<P>
   It is conceivable that by the time peace in some form returns to
Kosovo, Russia will have managed to profit from the crisis in more
ways than economic.
</P>
<P>
   Seen cynically, Russia's snarls of hostility over Kosovo are in
part prompted, not so much by concern for their Serb cousins
(Russia has said not a word about the plight of the hapless
Kosovars), but by a desperate need in these second-class-power days
to hog the diplomatic spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by playing its hand in a more principled fashion, Russia's
diplomacy could do a lot more: including wiping away the image of
Russia now forming in the West _ that of a country that
increasingly finds its friends among the world's despots (Milosevic
and Iraq's Saddam Hussein being two of them) not its democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's diplomatic leverage has been increased by the fact that
NATO's leaders have underestimated Milosevic's determination to
keep Kosovo in his grip and thus overestimated their ability to
herd him into a peace deal with threats alone: the air strikes may
have to go on for painfully long yet.
</P>
<P>
   They also overlooked the Milosevic capacity for serial barbarity
_ though why, after the horrors of Bosnia, is unclear. He has
driven hundreds of thousands of civilians from their homes,
executed large numbers of Kosovo's menfolk and used the plight of
the refugee flood he has created as a weapon of war.
</P>
<P>
   But at some point a peace deal will have to be crafted with
Serbia, perhaps even with Milosevic in power.
</P>
<P>
   Russia could play a big part, offering Milosevic face-saving
ways _ for example, a largish contingent of Russian troops in a
future peacekeeping force _ of claiming that it was Russia's
backing, not NATO's bombing, that had brought about peace (though
without the air strikes he would have ``cleansed'' Kosovo and hoped
to get away with it).
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's credibility would also be on the line. Although it
has parted company bitterly with the West over air strikes, Russia
had fully supported the peace deal that Milosevic tore up last
month.
</P>
<P>
   That included a far-reaching degree of autonomy for the Kosovars
and an international peacekeeping force to ensure Milosevic kept
his word.
</P>
<P>
   Those same principles have been supported by the U.N.
secretary-general. Russia should in no way try to help Milosevic
off these hooks now.
</P>
<P>
   Step back from the frostiness of recent weeks and the divide
over Kosovo looks different. Ranged against Milosevic for his
yearlong brutalities are not only all of the West's strongest
democracies (including France, long a friend of Serbia), but also
much of world public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   By now Russia, North Korea and China are about the only
self-confessed friends Milosevic has.
</P>
<P>
   Until now Russia has wanted to be counted among the democracies,
with all the trappings of membership in the premier western clubs.
Is it really in Russia's interests to gamble away its standing in
the democratic world in support of a regime that has committed the
most heinous human-rights abuses in modern Europe?
</P>
<P>
   But if that is to be the dividing line of a new cold war, so be
it. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The bombing of Serbia has spread a deep _ and perhaps
long-lasting _ chill over NATO's relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The West's hoped-for, bear-hugging strategic partnership with a
newly democratic Russia gave way pretty quickly to one of a
pricklier sort: a readiness to agree where they could, but to
disagree openly and at times bad-temperedly where they couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   By now that air of intermittent iciness seems to have turned
into a veritable blizzard of dispute: from the war in Bosnia to the
handling of Iraq, from NATO's inclusion of Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary as new members, to be sealed ceremonially at
the alliance's summit in Washington on April 23, to the conflict
over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   This time the chill seems both deeper and more dangerous.
President Yeltsin has not only barked his hostility to NATO's air
and missile strikes, he is sending Russian intelligence-gathering
ships to the Adriatic, he may have hinted that his nuclear missiles
could be retargeted at NATO cities.
</P>
<P>
   He has also said that the use of NATO troops in Kosovo to end
Serb attacks on the mostly Muslim population could even turn a
potential cold war hot by drawing Russia into the fighting on
Serbia's side, possibly provoking a wider conflict in Europe or
even a ``third world war.''
</P>
<P>
   An alarming prospect. But, barring great stupidity on both
sides, not a likely one.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Russians are deeply unhappy at seeing fellow Slavs
being bombed by a military alliance that within shortish memory was
the old Soviet Union's implacable foe.

<P>
   The march of technology is a social as well as an economic
phenomenon. Some whole industries, such as personal computers, seem
to rely on the insatiable desire of people for the latest gadget.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind whether you really need it: just throw away your old
computer, television, hi-fi or whatever and buy a newer, better
(and often cheaper) one.
</P>
<P>
   An unwelcome side-effect is an instinctive tendency to disparage
older technologies in favor of newer ones.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ditching the old completely can often prove a mistake _
because technologies that are dismissed as yesterday's habits
sometimes turn out to be not such old hat after all. What was once
regarded as obsolete can, with a minor tweak or embellishment, be
revived as fast as any old fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The latest instance of an old technology to be rehabilitated in
just such a way is clockwork.
</P>
<P>
   Once a standard method of powering clocks, watches and
children's toys, it fell from grace with the rise of
battery-powered gadgets. Yet, as the power needed by modern
circuitry decreases, clockwork is becoming a feasible power source
once more.
</P>
<P>
   Wind-up radios and flashlights are on sale. The American
military is evaluating hand-cranked satellite-navigation devices
and landmine detectors that would save soldiers from having to lug
bulky battery packs around.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of other mechanical devices have been revived too. A
hundred years ago, all calculators were mechanical, but they were
displaced by electronic ones containing valves, then transistors,
and finally microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Now microscopic mechanical components are staging a comeback at
the heart of a new class of silicon chips.
</P>
<P>
   Such microelectro-mechanical systems can sometimes do things
that electronics cannot: tiny silicon arms and levers can, for
example, act as compact filters, timekeepers, optical switches and
sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Transport offers other examples. Filthy, soot-belching steam
locomotives were rejected in favor of diesel and electric ones
decades ago. Now new, modernized steam engines are sometimes more
efficient and more environmentally friendly than diesels.
</P>
<P>
   Airships and balloons are also poised to return to the
ascendant. New airships, built with space-age materials and filled
with inert helium rather than explosive hydrogen, are taking to the
skies.
</P>
<P>
   Plans have even been floated to use them as fixed communications
relay-stations over big cities. Researchers are looking into the
use of balloons to carry scientific instruments over the surface of
other planets.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider the triumph of paper. The computer has entirely
failed to dethrone paper; instead, computers make it easier to
generate documents, and the introduction of the PC, far from
fostering the paperless office, has led to a huge increase in
paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   It is even possible to spot a similar pattern in wars: as events
in Kosovo are showing, even the stealthiest fighter/bomber cannot
substitute for the man on the ground with a machine gun.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of history is, in short, that even apparently
moribund technologies such as clockwork have a persistent habit of,
well, springing back to life.
</P>
<P>
   That is worth remembering next time you hear the death knell
being sounded for a supposedly outmoded way of doing things. Last
year's habit can often turn out to be next year's habit too. &QL;

   SAN JOSE _ For some in Silicon Valley it is not enough to have
invented ``the new economy.'' They claim to have invented a new
society, too, one that has abolished class and race prejudice, and
judges people purely on the basis of merit.
</P>
<P>
   This is certainly true for Asians. Almost a third of the
region's scientists and engineers are Asian-born.
</P>
<P>
   Indians and Chinese created 27 percent of the 4,000-plus
high-tech businesses founded in 1991-96. But, for the region's
fastest-growing ethnic group, the picture is very different.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos make up 23 percent of the region's population; but when
the San Francisco Chronicle investigated 33 high-tech firms last
year it found that only 7 percent of the work force were Latinos,
and hardly any of these held managerial jobs.
</P>
<P>
   So what? The overworked cyber-elite desperately needs people to
tend its children and clean its houses. And a large number of the
Latinos are poorly educated immigrants. So long as the ladder of
opportunity stretches from Taco Bell to Intel, there should be no
need to worry.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that the ladder is getting more rickety. Only 56
percent of Latino students graduate from high school, a smaller
proportion than a few years ago; only 19 percent complete the basic
courses you need to get into college; and only 11 percent are
enrolled in an advanced maths class.
</P>
<P>
   One Latina in eight has a baby before her 18th birthday. The
Latino barrios of East Palo Alto and East San Jose are as rough and
tough as the rest of the region is soft and cerebral.
</P>
<P>
   The poor are not only falling further behind the rich. They are
losing out in absolute terms as well.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991-97, households in the bottom 20 percent of the income
distribution saw their real income fall by 8 percent, according to
a local think-tank, Joint Venture Silicon Valley Network. During
the same period households in the top 20 percent saw their income
increase by 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The canneries and defense companies that used to provide
immigrants with well-paid jobs have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech giants such as Hewlett-Packard once prided themselves
on their ability to promote talented shop-floor workers. Now they
have contracted out their manufacturing to specialists, many of
them abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the Valley is being set by smaller companies that
value speed and flexibility above all else: a marvelous development
for educated job-hoppers, but a dismal one for people who start at
the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, many Latinos made it into the middle class by dint
of buying houses and starting businesses rather than accumulating
education, a pattern that still prevails in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The father of Ruben Barrales, the president of Joint Venture,
immigrated from Mexico in the late 1950s, began work as a laborer,
but then started a roofing business and bought his own house, along
with several other bits of property.
</P>
<P>
   Such upward mobility is a lot harder now. A survey of the area's
fastest-growing companies found that 84 percent of their jobs
required education beyond high school.
</P>
<P>
   Most Latinos lack the capital they need to expand small
businesses. And now that the average house price is $500,000 even
the middle classes _ let alone the poor _ cannot easily get into
the housing market.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Pastor, an academic at the University of California,
Santa Cruz, points to two other things that limit social mobility.
One is that, in this highly fluid economy, it is now more natural
to draft in a friend from the other side of the world than to
wonder whether your gardener carries the high-tech equivalent of a
general's baton in his knapsack.
</P>
<P>
   The second is the fact that people who rely on public transport
find it all but impossible to turn up for the night-time and
weekend shifts that many high-tech manufacturers demand.
</P>
<P>
   What can be done to close this growing digital divide? There are
lots of straws in the wind. Joint Venture is trying to bring the
Valley's social networks together so that the cyber-elite rub
shoulders with minorities.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's Center for Employment Training has a good record in
placing minorities in high-tech firms. Some local firms such as
Intel and Cisco Systems are bringing both computers and computer
education to schools.
</P>
<P>
   At Wilcox High School, which is about 30 percent Latino,
students recycle old computers, revamping them with the latest
chips and then handing them down to local elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos in general are getting more computer-savvy: one recent
survey suggests that, in the country as a whole, the proportion of
Hispanic homes with computers doubled in 1994-98, from 14 percent
to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this will be enough to prevent the new demographics from
colliding with the new economy remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos are becoming a powerful political force in Silicon
Valley. Last November, San Jose became the first major Californian
city to elect a Latino mayor, Ron Gonzales.
</P>
<P>
   The trade unions are recruiting lots of Latinos, scoring big
hits with their ``justice for janitors'' and ``living wage''
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The cyber-elite may yet have cause to regret that they did not
take their talk of a color-blind meritocracy a little more
seriously. &QL;

   ST. LOUIS _ As the big contenders for the White House start to
line up for next year's election, a herd of others are fighting for
their footnotes in history.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet, there is a bumper crop.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Palicki of Alabama, an Independent, is running his entire
campaign in cyberspace, and Joe Bellis of Kansas sports a website
only a bit less involved than the blueprints for the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Voters who complain that all politicians are the same have not
looked hard enough. David Wyatt, a bill-collector from Florida,
bases his platform on a classic Pink Floyd album, ``The Wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hines, a former U.S. Marine, is running from his West
Hollywood base as the first openly homosexual candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Hamm of Colorado, who won 70 votes in the 1996 New
Hampshire primary, is running again, undaunted, on the issue of
legalizing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Ballot-access laws vary from state to state. Some states, such
as New York, present barriers that even Ross Perot found daunting;
others require no more than a small filing fee, leaving plenty of
room for the tongue-in-cheek candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Hirschon, a bartender in the District of Columbia, is
sponsoring a contest for a running mate. Contenders must submit a
photograph: Hirschon is looking for a human but is willing to make
an exception for a cute family pet.
</P>
<P>
   Two professional wrestlers, Ric Flair and Hulk Hogan, perhaps
out of jealousy of their former colleague, now Minnesota's Governor
Jesse Ventura, are gearing up their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes, an ultra-right-wing black who ran in 1996, is a
possibility again in 2000, and may once more provide some comic
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Some parties have been around for so long that they are part of
the establishment, from the old warhorse Prohibition Party to the
right-wing U.S. Taxpayers and the far-left Socialist Workers. New
midgets, some of which exist chiefly in the minds of their
founders, put the old ones to shame.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing Christians have formed the Puritan Party, which
proposes to turn the United States into a theocracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Pansexual Peace Party advocates everything the Puritans
oppose.
</P>
<P>
   The Family Values Party was founded, according to Tom Wells of
Florida, at 2 a.m. on Christmas Day, 1994, when God spoke directly
to Wells and told him to run for Congress first and then for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most challenging of the dozen or so newcomers is the
National Equestrian Party, ``the party with horse sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the race for the Democratic and Republican nominations
will dominate the news, there are other vigorous contests.
</P>
<P>
   The Libertarian Party has a lively contest between a former
presidential candidate, Harry Browne, and another veteran, Jacob
``Bumper'' Hornberger.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party is wide open; its 1996 candidate, Ralph Nader,
may face both a 1960s icon, Angela Davis, and Dr. Hunter ``Patch''
Adams, the subject of a current film starring Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans complain that the presidential campaign is too
long. But the realities of time and money require contenders to
start work early if they are to have any hope of making a mark in
the primaries of 2000; California, the nation's biggest prize, has
moved its primary forward from June to March.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem a bit too soon to start the campaigns of 2020 or
2024. Yet that has not deterred a number of children who have
already declared their candidacies for the years in which they meet
the constitutional requirement to be 35 years old. &QL;

<P>
   The governor of New Mexico looks normal. He sounds normal. But
he is definitely not normal.
</P>
<P>
   He likes hang-gliding, parachuting, 100-mile races. He runs,
bikes or swims for two hours each day _ and he begins this routine
at five every morning.
</P>
<P>
   He once shut himself inside a freezer, to prove he could
withstand the cold; he clamped an alligator clip on to his tongue,
to show he could withstand pain.
</P>
<P>
   Now he aims to prove that he can stand heat, too, better than
anybody.
</P>
<P>
   While other governors tiptoe around the issue of education
reform, fearing that they will be burned, Gary Johnson declares
that every pupil in New Mexico must have a school voucher.
</P>
<P>
   Take a breath, and savor the mad scale of this ambition.
Although Milton Friedman came up with the idea of school vouchers
nearly half a century ago, it has barely been put into practice.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee led the way in 1990 with a voucher program that
covered 1,100 poor students; the scheme has been expanded since,
but still covers only 15,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland followed in 1995 with a program covering 2,000 pupils,
but the courts (pending an appeal) have found Cleveland's design to
be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in America is there a state-wide voucher scheme.
Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania and Arizona have recently debated the
idea; but all are plotting pilot projects, limited to the poorest
or academically weakest pupils.
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, Johnson is being far bolder. He wants to cover
100,000 children in the first year of his program, and all of them
soon after. And his style is as remarkable as his objective.
</P>
<P>
   In other states, pollsters have persuaded politicians not to
mention the ``V word'': voters seem to think that vouchers, which
give poor children the option to leave the public schools, will
drain the public system of resources. (In fact, so long as they are
properly designed, vouchers drain resources only as fast as they
drain resource-consuming pupils.)
</P>
<P>
   So Florida's vouchers are called ``opportunity scholarships,''
Pennsylvania has ``opportunity grants,'' and other states have
given up on vouchers in substance as well as language,
experimenting instead with various kinds of tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will have none of that. ``I was told not to use the V
word,'' he says of his campaign last year. ``I used it whenever
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that New Mexico lends itself easily to this kind of
radical idea. Its people adore big government, which is only
natural given that public spending accounts for half of New
Mexico's economy, compared with a third in the rest of America.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago the pollsters said that Johnson _ a Republican, and a
stridently free-market one at that _ would have a hard time getting
elected to a second term: the Democrats had fielded a strong
Hispanic candidate, and Hispanics account for 40 percent of New
Mexico's people.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson defied the odds. He won, and comfortably; he is the
first governor of New Mexico ever to win two consecutive terms in
office.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's record helps to explain his bravado on education.
If you remind him that voters have rejected pro-voucher referendums
in Oregon, California, Washington and Colorado, or if you dare
suggest that the polls augur poorly for his plan, the governor
responds with genial disregard: ``Damn the polls,'' he says, ``I
move them.''
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of prisons, the governor recalls, polls said
three-quarters of New Mexicans opposed privatization four years
ago. But the governor privatized them anyway, and now most New
Mexicans applaud him.
</P>
<P>
   Just possibly, Johnson may already be shifting the climate of
opinion on education. Before he began to speak out in favor of
vouchers, fewer than half of New Mexico's parents supported the
idea; but a recent survey suggested that 58 percent have now come
around to it.
</P>
<P>
   And the more the governor talks, the more converts he is likely
to win. He argues vigorously that other education remedies have
failed: since taking office in 1995, Johnson has raised education
spending by nearly a third, but dropout rates and test scores have
showed barely any improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Since money has not solved the problem, the governor goes on, it
is time to shake the system up. By making children mobile, comes
the conclusion, vouchers will require schools to improve
themselves, or lose their pupils.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's determination promises a fight worth watching.
The Democrats who run New Mexico's legislature have close ties to
the teachers' unions, and the unions hate vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   They have summoned their members to fight an anti-voucher
crusade, distributing the call through the state's network of
parent-teacher associations and through radio advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Democratic law makers have sent Johnson two
budgets, neither of which authorized vouchers. The governor vetoed
both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says he will carry on wielding his veto. If there is no
budget, so be it: the state government will shut down in July, and
remain shut until the Democrats see reason.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when a similar drama took place in Washington, three
years ago, it was the Republicans who were humbled in the end. But
Johnson reckons that was because Republicans occupied Congress
rather than the executive branch: New Mexico is different.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he may be willing to accept a voucher scheme
covering somewhat fewer than the 100,000 pupils he wants; but he is
not going to give up. He would rather sacrifice his popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Vouchers, he says, are ``a great issue to go down on.''
</P>
<P>
   If he can avoid going down, small New Mexico may suddenly have
big consequences. A Johnson victory would prove that school
vouchers can make good politics as well as good sense, and
encourage other Republicans to campaign on them.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a quiet pro-voucher tide flows in America: though only
51 percent of respondents in last year's Gallup poll favored
vouchers, that is up from 43 percent two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But the tide needs a bold surfer if it is to have policy
consequences. Gary Johnson, fitness fanatic that he is, seems the
ideal candidate. &QL;

<P>
   SINGAPORE AND HONG KONG _ America has Jeff Bezos; China has Jack
Ma Yun. Both are clever entrepreneurs who have grown rich by being
among the first to exploit the Internet's potential. But there the
similarities end.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, around the time Bezos was setting up Amazon.com, Ma was
sending his first e-mail message during a trip to America to
negotiate a deal for a provincial highway (of the asphalt variety).
</P>
<P>
   He got three responses and was so impressed that he bought a PC
with some winnings from Las Vegas, signed up with a web-hosting
service, and returned to China to found an Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   China would not get its first commercial Internet connection for
a few more months. When it did, and Ma logged into the Shanghai
service provider with a long-distance call from his native
Hangzhou, the first page of his site took three hours to load.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speed made me lose face, but at least I proved that I
could really do it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ma's sites, ChinaPages and ChinaMarket, had their
first few thousand visitors, Bezos was well on his way to becoming
a billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Asia is not America, especially when it comes to e-commerce.
However, countries in the region are racing to wire themselves up,
with such projects as Singapore's ``wired island,'' Malaysia's
multimedia super corridor and Hong Kong's planned ``cyberport.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they are only just getting to grips with their own
e-mail, government planners proclaim Asia's ambition to create a
networked society. In China, 1999 has been declared the ``year of
getting on the Internet'' and all ministries are creating websites.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Asia's economic crisis, Internet and e-commerce growth
rates are among the highest in the world, and often twice as high
as that in America.
</P>
<P>
   Every consultancy has its own estimates of Asian e-commerce
revenues; all agree that they are small compared to America's _ but
whose aren't? A more reliable guide may be the number of secure web
servers in each country.
</P>
<P>
   Secure servers are used mainly for e-commerce, and they have
certificates giving the actual country of residence, as opposed to
address ``domains'' such as ``.uk'' or ``.fr'' which can often be
misleading.
</P>
<P>
   By this measure, Asia is not as far behind the West as is often
thought. Today it has nearly two-thirds as many e-commerce servers
as the EU and it is gaining ground, according to Netcraft, a
consultancy.
</P>
<P>
   Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong are all above
the EU average of e-commerce servers per person. And China, which
two years ago had no such servers at all, is catching up at a
phenomenal pace, growing at an annual rate of more than 1,000
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Asian e-commerce is a breed apart. Although plenty of
Asian entrepreneurs dream of Amazon-like wealth, few have been
successful.
</P>
<P>
   The ownership of PCs is rising, albeit from a low base. But at
least half those PCs are not connected to a network, having been
bought mostly to educate children.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of online users in Asia are in business, compared
with a third in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There are other barriers to consumer e-commerce. Few Asians have
credit cards; they prefer face-to-face buying (mail-order has never
taken off, except in Australia and New Zealand); and most of the
region is plentifully served by corner shops.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Asian banks mistrust online transactions.
ActionAce.com, an online toy seller based in Hong Kong, has to
process its orders in America, because no local bank would serve
it.
</P>
<P>
   Business-to-business e-commerce, or e-business, is a different
story. Even in the home of consumer sites such as ebay and eTrade,
which steal the headlines and achieve dizzying valuations,
e-business is the greater part of online transactions.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, e-business is even more preponderant than in America
and it is likely to stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   Although Asian consumers are ill-prepared for e-commerce, its
businesses stand to gain far more than their western counterparts.
The region is dominated by small and medium-sized firms, many of
them exporters in manufacturing industries. Most were too small to
jump on to previous IT bandwagons.
</P>
<P>
   When companies such as WalMart pushed electronic data
interchange (EDI) in the 1980s, small Asian producers were often
left out, because they could not afford the proprietary systems
that they needed to gain access to the network.
</P>
<P>
   With the Internet, they can redress the balance. Few have
mainframes running business processes or databases keeping stock.
But they can do wonders for their efficiency by replacing women at
desks shuffling countless flimsy paper forms.
</P>
<P>
   Small Asian firms are notoriously bad at international
marketing, something a website makes simpler. E-mail is cheaper
than faxes and international telephone calls. Even the smallest
factory can afford a PC and a dial-up Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Take the example of Asian Sources. A few years ago, this firm
was chiefly a trade-paper publisher, sending hundreds of salesmen
to tiny factories in China, Taiwan and elsewhere in Asia to sell
product-display advertising in glossy catalogues.
</P>
<P>
   Now Asian Sources is shifting to a website. The same salesmen
carry digital cameras and teach factory managers how to use e-mail,
even helping them set up their first PC.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7,000 manufacturers, some of them tiny shops in remote
Chinese provinces, are now online.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas big Western firms have the clout to become e-business
hubs themselves, smaller Asian firms are turning to ``electronic
trade associations'' that are starting to create entire e-commerce
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The Gartner Group, a consultancy, counts more than 100 of these
third-party hubs in Asia, such as Advanced Manufacturing Online
(AMO) and Arena (formally Cargonet), a site that tracks shipments
and export logistics for dozens of firms.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, firms will compete ``supply-chain versus
supply-chain,'' says James Hatcher of AMO; the most wired firms
have the greatest chance of prevailing. It may not be as glamorous
as books and videos, but it fits better with Asia's strengths in
manufacturing and trading.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, the Internet is seen as a libertarian's
dream, releasing commerce and consumers from government
interference. There is no such fervor in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Without a Nasdaq on which to launch start-ups, and little
appetite among investors for firms, such as Amazon, that lose money
with every sale, Asian governments have been the main promoters of
Asian e-commerce _ and welcome ones at that.
</P>
<P>
   When China's trade ministry asked Ma to set up ChinaMarket,
4,500 companies joined before he ran a single advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   There may not be anything headline-grabbing about most
e-business _ an e-mail here, a website there _ but an e-commerce
revolution is nevertheless under way. &QL;

<P>
   SINGAPORE AND HONG KONG _ America has Jeff Bezos; China has Jack
Ma Yun. Both are clever entrepreneurs who have grown rich by being
among the first to exploit the Internet's potential. But there the
similarities end.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, around the time Bezos was setting up Amazon.com, Ma was
sending his first e-mail message during a trip to America to
negotiate a deal for a provincial highway (of the asphalt variety).
</P>
<P>
   He got three responses and was so impressed that he bought a PC
with some winnings from Las Vegas, signed up with a web-hosting
service, and returned to China to found an Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   China would not get its first commercial Internet connection for
a few more months. When it did, and Ma logged into the Shanghai
service provider with a long-distance call from his native
Hangzhou, the first page of his site took three hours to load.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speed made me lose face, but at least I proved that I
could really do it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ma's sites, ChinaPages and ChinaMarket, had their
first few thousand visitors, Bezos was well on his way to becoming
a billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Asia is not America, especially when it comes to e-commerce.
However, countries in the region are racing to wire themselves up,
with such projects as Singapore's ``wired island,'' Malaysia's
multimedia super corridor and Hong Kong's planned ``cyberport.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they are only just getting to grips with their own
e-mail, government planners proclaim Asia's ambition to create a
networked society. In China, 1999 has been declared the ``year of
getting on the Internet'' and all ministries are creating websites.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Asia's economic crisis, Internet and e-commerce growth
rates are among the highest in the world, and often twice as high
as that in America.
</P>
<P>
   Every consultancy has its own estimates of Asian e-commerce
revenues; all agree that they are small compared to America's _ but
whose aren't? A more reliable guide may be the number of secure web
servers in each country.
</P>
<P>
   Secure servers are used mainly for e-commerce, and they have
certificates giving the actual country of residence, as opposed to
address ``domains'' such as ``.uk'' or ``.fr'' which can often be
misleading.
</P>
<P>
   By this measure, Asia is not as far behind the West as is often
thought. Today it has nearly two-thirds as many e-commerce servers
as the EU and it is gaining ground, according to Netcraft, a
consultancy.
</P>
<P>
   Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong are all above
the EU average of e-commerce servers per person. And China, which
two years ago had no such servers at all, is catching up at a
phenomenal pace, growing at an annual rate of more than 1,000
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Asian e-commerce is a breed apart. Although plenty of
Asian entrepreneurs dream of Amazon-like wealth, few have been
successful.
</P>
<P>
   The ownership of PCs is rising, albeit from a low base. But at
least half those PCs are not connected to a network, having been
bought mostly to educate children.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of online users in Asia are in business, compared
with a third in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There are other barriers to consumer e-commerce. Few Asians have
credit cards; they prefer face-to-face buying (mail-order has never
taken off, except in Australia and New Zealand); and most of the
region is plentifully served by corner shops.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Asian banks mistrust online transactions.
ActionAce.com, an online toy seller based in Hong Kong, has to
process its orders in America, because no local bank would serve
it.
</P>
<P>
   Business-to-business e-commerce, or e-business, is a different
story. Even in the home of consumer sites such as ebay and eTrade,
which steal the headlines and achieve dizzying valuations,
e-business is the greater part of online transactions.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, e-business is even more preponderant than in America
and it is likely to stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   Although Asian consumers are ill-prepared for e-commerce, its
businesses stand to gain far more than their western counterparts.
The region is dominated by small and medium-sized firms, many of
them exporters in manufacturing industries. Most were too small to
jump on to previous IT bandwagons.
</P>
<P>
   When companies such as WalMart pushed electronic data
interchange (EDI) in the 1980s, small Asian producers were often
left out, because they could not afford the proprietary systems
that they needed to gain access to the network.
</P>
<P>
   With the Internet, they can redress the balance. Few have
mainframes running business processes or databases keeping stock.
But they can do wonders for their efficiency by replacing women at
desks shuffling countless flimsy paper forms.
</P>
<P>
   Small Asian firms are notoriously bad at international
marketing, something a website makes simpler. E-mail is cheaper
than faxes and international telephone calls. Even the smallest
factory can afford a PC and a dial-up Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Take the example of Asian Sources. A few years ago, this firm
was chiefly a trade-paper publisher, sending hundreds of salesmen
to tiny factories in China, Taiwan and elsewhere in Asia to sell
product-display advertising in glossy catalogues.
</P>
<P>
   Now Asian Sources is shifting to a website. The same salesmen
carry digital cameras and teach factory managers how to use e-mail,
even helping them set up their first PC.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7,000 manufacturers, some of them tiny shops in remote
Chinese provinces, are now online.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas big Western firms have the clout to become e-business
hubs themselves, smaller Asian firms are turning to ``electronic
trade associations'' that are starting to create entire e-commerce
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The Gartner Group, a consultancy, counts more than 100 of these
third-party hubs in Asia, such as Advanced Manufacturing Online
(AMO) and Arena (formally Cargonet), a site that tracks shipments
and export logistics for dozens of firms.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, firms will compete ``supply-chain versus
supply-chain,'' says James Hatcher of AMO; the most wired firms
have the greatest chance of prevailing. It may not be as glamorous
as books and videos, but it fits better with Asia's strengths in
manufacturing and trading.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, the Internet is seen as a libertarian's
dream, releasing commerce and consumers from government
interference. There is no such fervor in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Without a Nasdaq on which to launch start-ups, and little
appetite among investors for firms, such as Amazon, that lose money
with every sale, Asian governments have been the main promoters of
Asian e-commerce _ and welcome ones at that.
</P>
<P>
   When China's trade ministry asked Ma to set up ChinaMarket,
4,500 companies joined before he ran a single advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   There may not be anything headline-grabbing about most
e-business _ an e-mail here, a website there _ but an e-commerce
revolution is nevertheless under way. &QL;

<P>
   EAST JERUSALEM _ Even by his own globe-trotting standards,
Yasser Arafat has clocked up an enormous number of air miles.
Between late March and early April, the Palestinian leader visited
a dozen capitals in as many days.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of this frenetic diplomacy was to ``consult'' friendly
governments about what he should do on May 4. This is the expiry
deadline for the Oslo agreement's five-year interim period, and the
date, according to the Oslo process, when Israel and the
Palestinians should have reached a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the date on which Arafat has been insisting for the
past 20 months that, should there be no agreement, it is the
Palestinians' right to declare a state unilaterally in the West
Bank and Gaza ``with Jerusalem as its capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Palestinians are aware that their leader's diplomatic
offensive is an exercise in damage limitation. From Washington to
Moscow to Tokyo, Arafat has been told that he must postpone any
unilateral declaration.
</P>
<P>
   The world's caution is not about the Palestinians' right to
statehood, which is gaining general recognition. It is born of the
fear that a Palestinian UDI would allow Israel's prime minister,
Benjamin Netanyahu, to tear up the Oslo agreement _ and milk for
all it is worth the issue of ``Palestinian terrorism'' less than
two weeks before Israel's crucial election on May 17.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's problem is how to climb down from the UDI tree without
losing face with his own people. It is proving to be a hazardous
descent.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders have offered some ladders to help him. The Americans
have combined quiet promises of a more active role in the peace
process after Israel's election with denunciations of Israel's
continuing expansion of settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has gone further. Its leaders, meeting in
Berlin last month, issued a statement reaffirming the Palestinians'
``unqualified'' right to self-determination, ``including the option
of a state.''
</P>
<P>
   While urging both sides to agree to an extension of the interim
period beyond May 4, the EU also said that Palestinian
self-determination is a right ``not subject to any veto'' and that
it believed that it should be possible ``to conclude the
negotiations [on a final agreement] within a target period of one
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat called the declaration a historic endorsement of
Palestinian rights.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, for his part, regretted ``that Europe, where a third
of the Jewish people perished, would see fit to impose a solution
that endangers the state of Israel and its interests.'' It was a
comment that made even some of his supporters wince.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has said that the final decision on whether to declare a
state will be made by the Palestine Liberation OrganiZation's
125-member Central Committee in Gaza on April 27.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is that the package of American promises
and European declarations will be enough to marshal a majority in
favor of postponement.
</P>
<P>
   But an increasing number of Palestinians argue that promises and
declarations, when faced with an Israel that may after all continue
to be led by Netanyahu, are no longer enough.
</P>
<P>
   On April 9, a prominent member of Arafat's Fatah movement, Ahmed
Korei (Abu Ala), wrote a long article in two Palestinian newspapers
arguing that the Palestinians should declare a state on May 4 and
let the world be damned.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Palestinian architects of the Oslo agreement, Korei
is not known as a radical. But as speaker of the elected
Palestinian Legislative Council he has to listen to public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   He makes the telling point that postponing statehood on May 4
would be no less ial to Netanyahu's electoral fortunes than
declaring it.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian retreat, he writes, would be used by the Likud
leader as proof that he has succeeded in ``lowering Palestinian
expectations'' on any permanent deal.
</P>
<P>
   Other Palestinian leaders agree that May 4 cannot come and go
like any other day. Azmi Shuiabi, a member of the PLO's Central
Committee, says that it would be ``foolish'' for the Palestinians
to pit themselves against the international consensus in favor of
postponing a declaration of statehood.
</P>
<P>
   But he also says that the Palestinians should not extend Oslo's
interim period without ``guarantees'' from Israel, the United
States and the EU. Chief among these, says Shuiabi, should be an
``absolute freeze'' on all settlement construction. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to Israel's Peace Now movement, Netanyahu's government
has established 17 new ``hilltop'' settlements since the Wye
agreement was signed last October. This has swollen the West Bank's
settler population from its present 160,000 to a potential 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   The new settlements, Peace Now points out, are close to areas
from which Israel is supposed to withdraw under the terms of Wye.
</P>
<P>
   Should they be developed, a future Palestinian state would find
it difficult to expand much beyond the 29 percent of the West Bank
the Palestinian Authority (PA) currently (and partially) controls.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans say that such construction runs counter to
understandings reached with Netanyahu at the time of the Wye
negotiations. Netanyahu responds that ``We (Israel and America)
have never had an agreement to limit activities in the
settlements.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks before the ``sacred date'' of May 4, Arafat's
dilemma is acute.
</P>
<P>
   Should he declare a state, or suspend what many Palestinians see
as the constraining terms of the interim agreements (especially the
security cooperation between the PA, Israel and the CIA), he may
enhance Likud's chances and anger the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Should he do nothing, he will be exposed before his people as a
leader who is impotent in the face of an Israeli government that
not only declares its intention ``never'' to allow a Palestinian
state, but which every day builds facts to prevent one from
emerging. &QL;

   The new settlements, Peace Now points out, are close to areas
from which Israel is supposed to withdraw under the terms of Wye.

   Should they be developed, a future Palestinian state would find
it difficult to expand much beyond the 29 percent of the West Bank
the Palestinian Authority (PA) currently (and partially) controls.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans say that such construction runs counter to
understandings reached with Netanyahu at the time of the Wye
negotiations. Netanyahu responds that ``We (Israel and America)
have never had an agreement to limit activities in the
settlements.'' &QL;

<P>
   Three weeks before the ``sacred date'' of May 4, Arafat's
dilemma is acute.
</P>
<P>
   Should he declare a state, or suspend what many Palestinians see
as the constraining terms of the interim agreements (especially the
security cooperation between the PA, Israel and the CIA), he may
enhance Likud's chances and anger the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Should he do nothing, he will be exposed before his people as a
leader who is impotent in the face of an Israeli government that
not only declares its intention ``never'' to allow a Palestinian
state, but which every day builds facts to prevent one from
emerging. &QL;

<P>
   Your home soon will be worth less than it is now. And in a few
years, it will be worth even less. And in a few decades, it will be
worth a lot less. That's right _ less.
</P>
<P>
   Forget what real-estate brokers tell you. Forget what you read
in the real-estate section of your local newspaper. Forget your
dream about cashing out of that new split-level on steroids when
you retire and taking off for some sunny and cheaper clime.
</P>
<P>
   Forget it. You're doomed because of demographics. You're doomed
because of disinflation. You're doomed because home builders will
keep building homes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, your home _ unless you're one of the lucky few _ might
be losing value right now, as you sleep, as you mow the lawn, as
you fix the roof, as you write the mortgage check.
</P>
<P>
   You thought the real-estate recession was over? Just wait until
the Real Estate Crash of 2010.
</P>
<P>
   And this is not a Paul Erdman novel.
</P>
<P>
   In the gray world of housing economics, it is known simply as
McFadden's chart, although adjectives and analogies to Mount
Everest or the Matterhorn are sometimes attached _ and they are
certainly apt.
</P>
<P>
   The chart is the centerpiece of a report written in 1994 by
Professor Daniel McFadden, an economist. Simply put, McFadden
posited that home prices would peak in the mid-1990s, and slowly
fall to their inflation-adjusted 1911 level (no, that's no typo _
1911) through the first half of the 21st century, affecting not
only baby boomers but Generation X, Y, and Z, too.
</P>
<P>
   This work, ``Demographics, the Housing Market, and the Welfare
of the Elderly,'' is no dumbed-down press release, either.
McFadden, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley,
wrote it under the aegis of the National Bureau of Economic
Research for a book, ``Studies in the Economics of Aging,'' which
was published by the University of Chicago Press.
</P>
<P>
   His work, much of it indecipherable to anyone without a
knowledge of advanced mathematics, is based on decades of
information, and it attempts to balance an obvious demographic
problem (the wave of baby boomers entering retirement) with housing
demand (which he believes will increase in retirement locales but
decrease in work locations) and housing supply (which he believes
will increase in capacity, despite limited land in desirable
areas).
</P>
<P>
   And in the time since his study first appeared, he hasn't backed
off any of its conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The McFadden chart, and its thesis, though downplayed or
dismissed by some economists, has its believers.
</P>
<P>
   John Tuccillo, the former chief economist for the National
Association of Realtors, shares some of McFadden's pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of layers at which this can be attacked,''
he says, ``but the bottom line is the same: After about 2022, the
housing market begins to fall off badly, and values probably suffer
badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will notice my date is later than McFadden's,'' Tuccillo
continues, ``and there are several reasons why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older boomers, those born between 1945 and 1956, will be more
long-lived, more active, and more interested in the housing market
than their forbearers. It's not until the younger boomers start to
retire that the numbers begin to turn against the real-estate
market.''
</P>
<P>
   McFadden's thesis is also one of the central focuses of the book
``Boomernomics: The Future of Your Money in the Upcoming
Generational Warfare,'' written by William Sterling and Stephen
Waite, an investment strategist and a portfolio manager,
respectively, at Credit Suisse, and published in 1998 by the
Library of Contemporary Thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barring war, pestilence, famine, or _ more likely, perhaps _
massive waves of immigration, the imbalance in size between the
baby boomers and the baby-bust generation suggests a buyers' market
for real estate ahead,'' says Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should be especially true in many Northern suburban
residential markets when the baby boomers begin to retire in large
numbers beginning around 2010.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautions, too, that the demographic shifts occur gradually,
so it's not as if a bear market in real estate can be predicted
with pinpoint accuracy. And the vagaries of the business cycle also
make a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is more predictable,'' Sterling says, ``is that the
underlying trend in real estate prices will be generally
unfavorable, and that home prices may have trouble keeping up with
inflation after the boomers begin to retire in large numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the crash will come like a man going bald:
slowly, surely, painfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not necessary for home prices to decline in nominal
dollars in coming years for homes to represent a terrible
investment for baby boomers,'' Sterling says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McFadden chart implies, between 1995 and 2020, an annual
inflation-adjusted depreciation of about 0.8 percent per year,
which sounds rather harmless,'' Sterling says. ``But compounded
over 25 years, that results in an inflation-adjusted loss of 19
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Assume a rate of inflation that approximates recent experience _
say, 2 percent annually. In that case, McFadden's projections imply
that home prices rise modestly but fail to keep pace with
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Using McFadden's profile for real home prices, today's $150,000
home would be worth $172,000 in 2010, $193,000 in 2020, and
$216,000 in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't sound bad,'' Sterling says, ``until one realizes
that, to keep up with inflation of 2 percent annually, today's
$150,000 home would have to be worth $190,000 in 2010, $232,000 in
2020, and $283,000 in 2030.''
</P>
<P>
   That loss of value on an after-inflation basis will get worse as
more boomers move into retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   ``McFadden projects an average annual real depreciation per year
of about 1 percent over the 1995-to-2030 period, which would imply
a 30 percent decline in real values by 2030 from their 1995
level,'' Sterling says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, a home that cost $150,000 in 1995 will have a
value of $136,000 in 2010, if inflation is zero, and $121,500 in
2020 and $105,000 in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   ``If inflation settles in at about 1 percent per annum, then
today's $150,000 home can be expected to remain at around $150,000
into the 2010, 2020, and 2030 horizon. Even modest-sounding rates
of inflation, like 1 percent per annum, imply a substantial loss in
the purchasing power of the dollar over long periods.''
</P>
<P>
   The detractors to the McFadden chart are many, of course. Even
McFadden has his doubts about the collapse of real estate, noting
the difficulty and the track record of long-range forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'm not shorting real estate,'' he says. Still the
evidence is strong that the inflation-fueled real-estate heyday
that many boomers and, in particular, their parents witnessed in
the 1970s and 1980s isn't going to be seen again. Ever. &QL;

   ``Senior boomers will be forced to accept the unpleasant choice
of selling at unattractive price levels or rethinking their plans
to move south or buy smaller homes,'' Sterling says, adding that
this could forestall a retirement real-estate boom in places like
Florida and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical characteristic of real-estate markets under
distress is that transactions simply dry up,'' Sterling says.
``Would-be sellers, when confronted with poor market conditions,
often just take their homes off the market, hoping to re-list later
on when things improve.
</P>
<P>

waiting for things to improve may have a long wait indeed.'' &QL;

the Real Estate Crash of 2010.
</P>
<P>
   And this is not a Paul Erdman novel.
</P>
<P>
   In the gray world of housing economics, it is known simply as
McFadden's chart, although adjectives and analogies to Mount
Everest or the Matterhorn are sometimes attached _ and they are
certainly apt.
</P>
<P>
   The chart is the centerpiece of a report written in 1994 by
Professor Daniel McFadden, an economist. Simply put, McFadden
posited that home prices would peak in the mid-1990s, and slowly
fall to their inflation-adjusted 1911 level (no, that's no typo _
1911) through the first half of the 21st century, affecting not
only baby boomers but Generation X, Y, and Z, too.
</P>
<P>
   This work, ``Demographics, the Housing Market, and the Welfare
of the Elderly,'' is no dumbed-down press release, either.
McFadden, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley,
wrote it under the aegis of the National Bureau of Economic
Research for a book, ``Studies in the Economics of Aging,'' which
was published by the University of Chicago Press.
</P>
<P>
   His work, much of it indecipherable to anyone without a
knowledge of advanced mathematics, is based on decades of
information, and it attempts to balance an obvious demographic
problem (the wave of baby boomers entering retirement) with housing
demand (which he believes will increase in retirement locales but
decrease in work locations) and housing supply (which he believes
will increase in capacity, despite limited land in desirable
areas).
</P>
<P>
   And in the time since his study first appeared, he hasn't backed
off any of its conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The McFadden chart, and its thesis, though downplayed or
dismissed by some economists, has its believers.
</P>
<P>
   John Tuccillo, the former chief economist for the National
Association of Realtors, shares some of McFadden's pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of layers at which this can be attacked,''
he says, ``but the bottom line is the same: After about 2022, the
housing market begins to fall off badly, and values probably suffer
badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will notice my date is later than McFadden's,'' Tuccillo
continues, ``and there are several reasons why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older boomers, those born between 1945 and 1956, will be more
long-lived, more active, and more interested in the housing market
than their forbearers. It's not until the younger boomers start to
retire that the numbers begin to turn against the real-estate
market.''
</P>
<P>
   McFadden's thesis is also one of the central focuses of the book
``Boomernomics: The Future of Your Money in the Upcoming
Generational Warfare,'' written by William Sterling and Stephen
Waite, an investment strategist and a portfolio manager,
respectively, at Credit Suisse, and published in 1998 by the
Library of Contemporary Thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barring war, pestilence, famine, or _ more likely, perhaps _
massive waves of immigration, the imbalance in size between the
baby boomers and the baby-bust generation suggests a buyers' market
for real estate ahead,'' says Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should be especially true in many Northern suburban
residential markets when the baby boomers begin to retire in large
numbers beginning around 2010.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautions, too, that the demographic shifts occur gradually,
so it's not as if a bear market in real estate can be predicted
with pinpoint accuracy. And the vagaries of the business cycle also
make a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is more predictable,'' Sterling says, ``is that the
underlying trend in real estate prices will be generally
unfavorable, and that home prices may have trouble keeping up with
inflation after the boomers begin to retire in large numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the crash will come like a man going bald:
slowly, surely, painfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not necessary for home prices to decline in nominal
dollars in coming years for homes to represent a terrible
investment for baby boomers,'' Sterling says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McFadden chart implies, between 1995 and 2020, an annual
inflation-adjusted depreciation of about 0.8 percent per year,
which sounds rather harmless,'' Sterling says. ``But compounded
over 25 years, that results in an inflation-adjusted loss of 19
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Assume a rate of inflation that approximates recent experience _
say, 2 percent annually. In that case, McFadden's projections imply
that home prices rise modestly but fail to keep pace with
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Using McFadden's profile for real home prices, today's $150,000
home would be worth $172,000 in 2010, $193,000 in 2020, and
$216,000 in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't sound bad,'' Sterling says, ``until one realizes
that, to keep up with inflation of 2 percent annually, today's
$150,000 home would have to be worth $190,000 in 2010, $232,000 in
2020, and $283,000 in 2030.''
</P>
<P>
   That loss of value on an after-inflation basis will get worse as
more boomers move into retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   ``McFadden projects an average annual real depreciation per year
of about 1 percent over the 1995-to-2030 period, which would imply
a 30 percent decline in real values by 2030 from their 1995
level,'' Sterling says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, a home that cost $150,000 in 1995 will have a
value of $136,000 in 2010, if inflation is zero, and $121,500 in
2020 and $105,000 in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   ``If inflation settles in at about 1 percent per annum, then
today's $150,000 home can be expected to remain at around $150,000
into the 2010, 2020, and 2030 horizon. Even modest-sounding rates
of inflation, like 1 percent per annum, imply a substantial loss in
the purchasing power of the dollar over long periods.''
</P>
<P>
   The detractors to the McFadden chart are many, of course. Even
McFadden has his doubts about the collapse of real estate, noting
the difficulty and the track record of long-range forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'm not shorting real estate,'' he says. Still the
evidence is strong that the inflation-fueled real-estate heyday
that many boomers and, in particular, their parents witnessed in
the 1970s and 1980s isn't going to be seen again. Ever. &QL;

<P>
   ``Senior boomers will be forced to accept the unpleasant choice
of selling at unattractive price levels or rethinking their plans
to move south or buy smaller homes,'' Sterling says, adding that
this could forestall a retirement real-estate boom in places like
Florida and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical characteristic of real-estate markets under
distress is that transactions simply dry up,'' Sterling says.
``Would-be sellers, when confronted with poor market conditions,
often just take their homes off the market, hoping to re-list later
on when things improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if demographic analysis is correct, boomers who are
waiting for things to improve may have a long wait indeed.'' &QL;

watched James Shea, NATO's spokesman, trying to explain why NATO
still didn't know what had happened on Wednesday.

   KOSOVO-TROOPS _ RINAS AIR FIELD, Albania _ Paratroopers of the
U.S. Army 82nd Airborne Division stepped off air transports here
late Sunday and early Monday, then made preparations to move north
to the troubled border area of northern Albania. The paratroopers
are the lead elements of the 2nd Battalion of the 505th Parachute
Infantry Regiment of the 82nd. The 505th Parachute Infantry
Regiment was the one Gen. Eisenhower dispatched into Normandy by
parachutes at the very start of the D-Day offensive. This is an
escalation of pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
not only because of the 82nd's reputation as troops who fight to
win, but that the 82nd is the first unit from outside the
traditional NATO troop pool in Europe to be sent to the combat
zone. (Albright, Cox News Service). 20.

long-running civil conflicts as something of broad consequence,
something that is the younger brother of genocide. Now I know.

   When you stand at the site of a massacre, two things happen.
First, you wonder about the depths of the human spirit. And then
you ask yourself how many lies can be told about it.
</P>
<P>
   The highway of death between Prizren and Djakovica _ on which
the Serbs say NATO slaughtered 74 Kosovo Albanian refugees in a
series of bombing raids _ is no different.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours after I slipped on a dead man's torso near an old
Turkish bridge, less than a day after I stood by the body of a
young and beautiful girl _ her eyes gently staring at me between
half-closed lids, the bottom half of her head bathed in blood _ I
watched James Shea, NATO's spokesman, trying to explain why NATO
still didn't know what had happened on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   All those torn and mangled bodies I had just seen _ the old man
ripped in half and blasted into a tree at Gradis, the smoldering
skeleton with one bloody, still flesh-adhering foot over the back
of a trailer at Terezick Most, the dead, naked man slouched over
the steering wheel of a burned tractor _ all, apparently, were a
mystery to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps The Independent can help clear up this unhappy state
of affairs with some evidence _ damning perhaps, certainly
important _ from the scene. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   But first a pause, to reflect on atrocities. The Serbs are
``ethnically cleansing'' Kosovo. It is a war crime. If NATO
massacred the 74 Albanians, the Serbs have killed many more.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, I saw four buses in Kosovo packed with terrified
Albanian women and children and old men, black curtains at the
windows of the buses in an attempt to hide their presence.
</P>
<P>
   And at a square in the otherwise deserted town of Pozeranje,
near Urosevac, I passed at least 200 pathetic Kosovo Albanians,
exhausted, frightened, carrying plastic bags of clothes and
battered holdalls, the old women in scarves, the young women
clutching children to their bosoms, the old men wearing black
berets. All were standing tightly together for protection, like
animals.
</P>
<P>
   They were waiting for another bus, I suppose _ and, not for the
first time these past three weeks, I thought of other scenes, in
Eastern Europe just over half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   At Pozeranje, I was seeing these poor people _ for a few seconds
only, from a vehicle window _ at the very moment of their
dispossession, on the very day of their ``cleansing,'' within hours
of their arrival among the flotsam of humanity along the Serbian
border 12 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wickedness I saw, the very moment of evil. When I drove
through Pozeranje again Thursday, it was empty save for four horses
running loose on the main road.
</P>
<P>
   So why dwell on the 74 dead Kosovo Albanians whose remains have
been left in such indignity along the Prizren-Djakovica road?
</P>
<P>
   Because the Serbs wanted us to see them? Because NATO was
already embarrassed by the Serb claims of their slaughter? Because
it ``evens the balance'' _ it does not _ between Serbia and its
enemies?
</P>
<P>
   No, I suspect that the road of death and its terrible corpses is
a challenge not to NATO's propaganda but to its morality.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, we are repeatedly told, represents ``us,'' the good moral,
decent people who oppose lies and murder. So NATO has a case to
answer _ for all our sakes. And the evidence lies on that awful
road with its eviscerated people and its bomb craters. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM; ARTICLE RESUMES) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   NATO ``thinks'' it bombed a tractor on a road north of
Djakovica. Indeed, NATO's military spokesman would say Thursday
only that is was ``possibly'' a tractor.
</P>
<P>
   Shea _ or ``Jamie'' as he enjoins us to call him _ says he is
still trying to find out what happened to the 74 refugees. NATO
needs more time, he tells us, to assess what it bombed and did not
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Well perhaps I can help Jamie to speed up his enquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four air-strike locations, I have visited the first three
_ at Velika Krusa, Gradis and Terzick Most _ and they run
consecutively from east to west along the Prizren-Djakovica road.
</P>
<P>
   At the third, I came across four bomb craters. I saw _ and in
some cases collected _ a number of bomb and missile parts. At
Gradis, I came across part of a missile circuit board, its
congealed wiring attached to a plate which contains a
manufacturer's code.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's Independent carried some of this. But NATO will need
the fullest possible information to trace this piece of ordnance
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The full code (the brackets are empty on the original) reads as
follows: SCHEM 872110 ( ) 96214ASSY8721122 -MSN 63341 (remaining
figures obscured by detonation damage).
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't take NATO armaments experts more than a few hours
to find out where that code came from _ indeed what aircraft
carried and fired that missile. Its pilot _ if it was a NATO bomb _
will then be able to explain why he fired it.
</P>
<P>
   At Velika Krusa, I found the fusing of an aerial bomb next to a
smashed trailer containing the belongings of 35 Albanian refugees,
four of whom _ all women - were killed in this air strike.
</P>
<P>
   I also have in my possession what may be a swivel system to an
aerial bomb. It is one-inch square, very damaged (Xs stand for the
illegible parts) _ but carries the code: ``X6214 - 837XNY.''
</P>
<P>
   At Gradis, I found a large bomb part, green in color but with
stencilled color code in English, whose full code reads: WING
ASSEMBLY 96214ASSY 78-201872 872128 DATE OF MFG 3/78.
</P>
<P>
   Another similar bomb part contained the numbers: 96214ASSY
887760-4.
</P>
<P>
   At Gradis, too, part of what appeared to be a detonator
contained a section of manufacturer's name: - TER Co Inc 13250.
</P>
<P>
   Again, NATO intelligence authorities should be able to work out
some of those codings within a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Another piece of a bomb had the single word ``BENDIX'' stamped
on the metal. Other bomb and missile fragments contained moving fin
assembly parts. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Most of the shrapnel was so sharp it that it cut the hands of
those who touched it. The corpses showed what happened when the
bomb parts shredded them alive.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bodies lying in a field at Terezicki Most _ that of a
man in his 40s _ had the top of his head cut cleanly off, along
with his brain and eyes so that his face had turned into an actor's
mask.
</P>
<P>
   A middle-aged woman in a purple pullover and brightly flowered
skirt, with her eyes open and a pale waxen face, had had her neck
cut open. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Now, maybe NATO will find that these bomb and missile assembly
parts belonged to weapons sold to other governments. Perhaps they
will be able to claim that a Balkan nation was given the aerial
bomb whose wing assembly number is recorded above.
</P>
<P>
   In which case, maybe NATO will say that the Yugoslav air force _
of which not a single aircraft has been seen in the air since the
start of the NATO bombardment _ carried out this massacre of
Albanian refugees. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 600 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,200) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Yugoslav army officers at the bomb sites made no
attempt to prevent photographers taking pictures of the larger
pieces (though they showed no interest in the codings and seemed
unable to understand my interest). And I saw one photographer drag
a piece of bomb several meters and turn it over for a better
photograph.
</P>
<P>
   But given the time available and the chaos on the road _ NATO
air raids were going on within a mile of us as we examined the bomb
sites _ it is impossible to believe that the Serbs had time to
construct these terrible scenes.
</P>
<P>
   At Gradis, there was evidence of strafing as well as aerial
bombing. Huge troughs had been cut into the earth, each two feet in
length, separated by up to 10 feet and unevenly separated as if a
drunken monster had lurched through the field and on to the road.
</P>
<P>
   These appeared identical to the cannon fire marks I found at the
scene of American A-10 ``Tankbuster'' strikes in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no burned-out tanks on the Prizren-Djakovica
road; only tractors and trailers and an old milk-yellow van turned
inside out by the explosion which destroyed it.
</P>
<P>
   Along miles of the same road were other tractors, some scorched,
most abandoned, apparently in panic, at the side of the road. The
few Kosovo Albanians we found spoke of thousands on the road that
day _ April 14 _ and it appears that they were moving in both
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors have said they came from the border, were moved to
Djakovica and then told by Serb forces to move to Prizren. Most say
they had no Serb escorts. I saw those awful buses with the black
curtains moving in both directions near Prizren on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethnic cleansing'' is not a precise art. Nor is fear.
Undoubtedly some of the Kosovo Albanians on the road were terrified
of the aircraft which bombed them in four separate locations. The
fourth attack took place at Meja on the other side of Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't difficult for me to imagine the terror on that road.
While we were picking our way through the corpses of Terezicki
Most, NATO planes dropped bombs less than a mile away _ cluster
bombs from the sound of them _ and a series of massive explosions
changed the air pressure around us.
</P>
<P>
   We watched the skies. From time to time, we could hear _ but not
see _ NATO jets power-diving. Columns of dark smoke billowed over
the bright green fields.
</P>
<P>
   But we found no military wreckage. Not a smashed rifle, not a
piece of armor. There was a lot of glass on parts of the road _ not
a commodity to find in large amounts on military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The only victims of these air strikes appeared to be civilians.
At Terezicki Most, I counted 13 corpses and other body parts. A
missile had rammed a tractor, setting fire to its trailer and
incinerating all inside.
</P>
<P>
   In the Prizren hospital mortuary, six corpses lay on the
concrete floor. There was a woman, breasts exposed, on the right, a
delicate child close to her with a bloodied face.
</P>
<P>
   A piece of paper with the number ``1'' written on it had been
pinned to the shroud half covering an unknown man. We had names for
the rest: Fikrija Sulja, Imer Celja, Ferat Bajrami, Persad Sanfjli
and Nerdgivare Zecin. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM. ARTICLE CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Along the road, there were clothes and rags and broken cups and
saucers beside the bomb sites and photograph albums and family
snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   I picked up photographs of a pretty young Kosovo Albanian woman
with a lace blouse and curls and long black earrings, of a smiling
four-year old boy in a T-shirt standing on a sofa behind a vase of
sunflowers, of the boy's parents and two other brothers on the same
sofa, of two old women in Muslim scarves and of a blood group
certificate _ Rhesus positive _ for a woman named Rama Resmije,
dated March 16, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Did she live or die? Were the little boy and his parents and
brothers torn apart in the air strikes on Wednesday? And what of
the pretty woman in the earrings?
</P>
<P>
   If they survived, they deserve to know why their family and
friends died. If they were killed, we deserve to know why.
</P>
<P>
   That these people were massacred in air strikes I do not doubt.
I fear very much that they were slaughtered by NATO. If so, why?
</P>
<P>
   Was this some terrible error about which NATO _ after its attack
on a passenger train last week _ fears to tell us? Or did some NATO
pilots (and this massacre needed three or four planes) make an
error and agree to cover it up?
</P>
<P>
   Or _ most awful of all _ did a NATO pilot do something terrible,
inexplicable, two days ago and then lie about it?
</P>
<P>
   NATO, I suspect, can tell us. And those of us who walked among
the innocent dead on the road from Prizren to Djakovica this week
are waiting to hear Jamie tell the truth. &QL;

YOUNG BREAST CANCER PATIENT RESISTS RADICAL TREATMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARSHA GINSBURG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One of the biggest paradoxes for doctors and
specialists is that some healthy women are choosing to remove their
breasts to prevent cancer, while those already stricken with cancer
are refusing to have them taken off.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Fox, 32, is among the women who are appalled by the
notion of removing a piece of their anatomy that is part of what
makes a woman a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were talking about a toe, I'd care less,'' said Fox, an
athlete who runs, swims and bicycles. But a mastectomy ``is
extremely invasive and extremely barbaric ... and unnecessary in
most situations.''
</P>
<P>
   If taken to its logical end, she wondered, ``Why not take
everything I don't need to survive?''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who has no family history of breast cancer, discovered a
lump in her breast last summer. Two days later, a biopsy delivered
the news no woman wants to hear: breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   She had the textbook treatment _ a lumpectomy to remove the
tumor. Then she went in for a second surgery to remove more
surrounding tissue that might contain cancerous cells.
</P>
<P>
   A month after her surgery, she started chemotherapy, and
followed it with radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer specialists estimate that breast cancer recurs in about
30 percent of women who get it once, though the risk varies
depending on the size of the tumor and how aggressively the cancer
cells replicate. There are cancer-fighting drugs like tamoxifen
that can lower a woman's risk of recurrence, and an experimental
drug raloxifene, under study to see if it reduces risk with fewer
side effects.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of interviewing a myriad health professionals,
preventive mastectomy was recommended. Fox cried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had gone through two surgeries to save the breast and not
do mastectomy in the first place. I thought this was all behind
me,'' she said. ``I walked out and said, `No way.' I wasn't going
to be paranoid about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who is an urban planner, had misgivings many single women
in their 30s might have about preventive mastectomy.
</P>
<P>
   She said losing sensation in her breasts would be bizarre, and
believed that having a mastectomy could lower her self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Although artificial implants can create breasts that appear very
real, she worried that the surgery would cause discomfort or limit
her in her many sports. If she has children someday, as she hopes,
she couldn't breast-feed.
</P>
<P>
   Among other issues: how would she explain to a boyfriend or
prospective husband about her artificial breasts?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard enough to date anyway and to find your soul mate,''
she said. ``And you add that complication on top of it ... I don't
know how most men feel about that and cancer and women without
breasts. It would probably be very scary because it deals with
their own mortality.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of her decision was based on vanity, Fox acknowledged, but
a larger part was based on the fact that doctors could offer no
guarantee that breast cancer would not recur after the mastectomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My breasts are definitely a part of me and who I am,'' she
said. ``It would be a huge loss for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Before she ruled out the operation, doctors recommended she take
the blood test for the BRCA gene mutation, which can raise a
woman's risk of breast or ovarian cancer to between 60 and 80
percent. Fox declined, concerned about discrimination in future
health coverage plans if she tested positive.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, her doctors suggested she take the drug tamoxifen,
which has been shown in studies to reduce the risk of cancer
recurrence in women by up to 45 percent. But the drug also raises
the risk of uterine cancer and birth defects, so Fox declined.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she takes Chinese and Tibetan herbs and listens to
positive healing tapes at night. She eats organic foods and
exercises rigorously.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said she sees cancer not as a dark cloud, but as ``something
you get through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the future is going to bring,'' she said.
``But I'm too young for this.''

   On Thursday, I saw four buses in Kosovo packed with terrified

   At Velika Krusa, I found the fusing of an aerial bomb next to a
smashed trailer containing the belongings of 35 Albanian refugees,
four of whom _ all women - were killed in this air strike.
</P>
<P>
   I also have in my possession what may be a swivel system to an
aerial bomb. It is one-inch square, very damaged (Xs stand for the
illegible parts) _ but carries the code: ``X6214 - 837XNY.''
</P>
<P>
   At Gradis, I found a large bomb part, green in color but with
stencilled color code in English, whose full code reads: WING
ASSEMBLY 96214ASSY 78-201872 872128 DATE OF MFG 3/78.
</P>
<P>
   Another similar bomb part contained the numbers: 96214ASSY
887760-4.
</P>
<P>
   At Gradis, too, part of what appeared to be a detonator
contained a section of manufacturer's name: - TER Co Inc 13250.
</P>
<P>
   Again, NATO intelligence authorities should be able to work out
some of those codings within a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Another piece of a bomb had the single word ``BENDIX'' stamped
on the metal. Other bomb and missile fragments contained moving fin
assembly parts. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Most of the shrapnel was so sharp it that it cut the hands of
those who touched it. The corpses showed what happened when the
bomb parts shredded them alive.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bodies lying in a field at Terezicki Most _ that of a
man in his 40s _ had the top of his head cut cleanly off, along
with his brain and eyes so that his face had turned into an actor's
mask.
</P>
<P>
   A middle-aged woman in a purple pullover and brightly flowered
skirt, with her eyes open and a pale waxen face, had had her neck
cut open. &QL;

<P>
   Now, maybe NATO will find that these bomb and missile assembly
parts belonged to weapons sold to other governments. Perhaps they
will be able to claim that a Balkan nation was given the aerial
bomb whose wing assembly number is recorded above.
</P>
<P>
   In which case, maybe NATO will say that the Yugoslav air force _
of which not a single aircraft has been seen in the air since the
start of the NATO bombardment _ carried out this massacre of
Albanian refugees. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 600 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,200) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Yugoslav army officers at the bomb sites made no
attempt to prevent photographers taking pictures of the larger
pieces (though they showed no interest in the codings and seemed
unable to understand my interest). And I saw one photographer drag
a piece of bomb several meters and turn it over for a better
photograph.
</P>
<P>
   But given the time available and the chaos on the road _ NATO
air raids were going on within a mile of us as we examined the bomb
sites _ it is impossible to believe that the Serbs had time to
construct these terrible scenes.
</P>
<P>
   At Gradis, there was evidence of strafing as well as aerial
bombing. Huge troughs had been cut into the earth, each two feet in
length, separated by up to 10 feet and unevenly separated as if a
drunken monster had lurched through the field and on to the road.
</P>
<P>
   These appeared identical to the cannon fire marks I found at the
scene of American A-10 ``Tankbuster'' strikes in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no burned-out tanks on the Prizren-Djakovica
road; only tractors and trailers and an old milk-yellow van turned
inside out by the explosion which destroyed it.
</P>
<P>
   Along miles of the same road were other tractors, some scorched,
most abandoned, apparently in panic, at the side of the road. The
few Kosovo Albanians we found spoke of thousands on the road that
day _ April 14 _ and it appears that they were moving in both
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors have said they came from the border, were moved to
Djakovica and then told by Serb forces to move to Prizren. Most say
they had no Serb escorts. I saw those awful buses with the black
curtains moving in both directions near Prizren on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethnic cleansing'' is not a precise art. Nor is fear.
Undoubtedly some of the Kosovo Albanians on the road were terrified
of the aircraft which bombed them in four separate locations. The
fourth attack took place at Meja on the other side of Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't difficult for me to imagine the terror on that road.
While we were picking our way through the corpses of Terezicki
Most, NATO planes dropped bombs less than a mile away _ cluster
bombs from the sound of them _ and a series of massive explosions
changed the air pressure around us.
</P>
<P>
   We watched the skies. From time to time, we could hear _ but not
see _ NATO jets power-diving. Columns of dark smoke billowed over
the bright green fields.
</P>
<P>
   But we found no military wreckage. Not a smashed rifle, not a
piece of armor. There was a lot of glass on parts of the road _ not
a commodity to find in large amounts on military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The only victims of these air strikes appeared to be civilians.
At Terezicki Most, I counted 13 corpses and other body parts. A
missile had rammed a tractor, setting fire to its trailer and
incinerating all inside.
</P>
<P>
   In the Prizren hospital mortuary, six corpses lay on the
concrete floor. There was a woman, breasts exposed, on the right, a
delicate child close to her with a bloodied face.
</P>
<P>
   A piece of paper with the number ``1'' written on it had been
pinned to the shroud half covering an unknown man. We had names for
the rest: Fikrija Sulja, Imer Celja, Ferat Bajrami, Persad Sanfjli
and Nerdgivare Zecin. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM. ARTICLE CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Along the road, there were clothes and rags and broken cups and
saucers beside the bomb sites and photograph albums and family
snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   I picked up photographs of a pretty young Kosovo Albanian woman
with a lace blouse and curls and long black earrings, of a smiling
four-year old boy in a T-shirt standing on a sofa behind a vase of
sunflowers, of the boy's parents and two other brothers on the same
sofa, of two old women in Muslim scarves and of a blood group
certificate _ Rhesus positive _ for a woman named Rama Resmije,
dated March 16, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Did she live or die? Were the little boy and his parents and
brothers torn apart in the air strikes on Wednesday? And what of
the pretty woman in the earrings?
</P>
<P>
   If they survived, they deserve to know why their family and
friends died. If they were killed, we deserve to know why.
</P>
<P>
   That these people were massacred in air strikes I do not doubt.
I fear very much that they were slaughtered by NATO. If so, why?
</P>
<P>
   Was this some terrible error about which NATO _ after its attack
on a passenger train last week _ fears to tell us? Or did some NATO
pilots (and this massacre needed three or four planes) make an
error and agree to cover it up?
</P>
<P>
   Or _ most awful of all _ did a NATO pilot do something terrible,
inexplicable, two days ago and then lie about it?
</P>
<P>
   NATO, I suspect, can tell us. And those of us who walked among
the innocent dead on the road from Prizren to Djakovica this week
are waiting to hear Jamie tell the truth. &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In the three weeks of war in the Balkans it is estimated that
NATO planes have flown 6,000 missions and 800 cruise missiles have
been launched.
</P>
<P>
   The tragic result is that the Kosovo conflict has turned into a
catastrophe, with hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians leaving
their homes and enduring appalling hardships. Many of them have
died in bombings or in the crossfire of fighting between the Kosovo
Liberation Army and Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   With the war sowing death and destruction throughout Yugoslavia,
the damage to it has been estimated at $200 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the conflict, many people warned that a military
operation against Yugoslavia would be a mistake, an unwarranted and
disproportionate measure, and urged a political solution. NATO took
a different course, which has resulted in an ignominious failure _
a defeat for NATO and for the policy of force generally.
</P>
<P>
   This could have untold consequences for Yugoslavia and for all
of Europe, unless urgent steps are taken to stop this madness.
Henry Kissinger, who was initially critical of President Clinton's
actions, is now saying that if NATO is to avoid breaking up it
cannot afford a defeat in Yugoslavia. He is apparently little
concerned about what would happen to the Albanians or to the Serbs
in the event of NATOs ``victory.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the leaders of the alliance speak of a political
solution, they in fact mean Yugoslavia's capitulation. But that is
just another dangerous illusion, a way to unpredictable,
catastrophic developments. The only alternative to a wider conflict
is a search for compromise.
</P>
<P>
   As I am writing this, news agencies report that the Turkish
authorities are conducting a major offensive against Kurdish
rebels. The long-seething conflict has erupted with fresh force,
but no one is saying a word. What will the United States and NATO
do? Give more weapons to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   And in Colombia, another friend of the United States, where
20,000 people die each year and the number of refugees has exceeded
1 million, even U.S. newspapers are wondering why the United States
chooses to ignore the responsibility of Colombia's government for
that tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, why? This is more than just a double standard. A much
broader hidden agenda is now being revealed. It is clear that the
Kosovo problem could have been resolved politically and that NATO's
military action can only make things worse. It is also clear that
this is a no-win situation for Europe.
</P>
<P>
   So why was the United States in such a hurry, why was it not
interested in political solutions? On the eve of NATO's 50th
anniversary, the Kosovo conflict is cynically being used to show
the world who's the boss.
</P>
<P>
   The international community is given to understand that the U.N.
Security Council and other international organizations are
ineffective, indeed helpless, thus forcing the United States to
``lead'' in this way. Even worse, to make arbitrary action look
legitimate, the conflict is being internationalized and other
countries are drawn into it, in a way that compromises them. But
that logic is fatally flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Soviet Union ceased to exist, the United States
has been boycotting all attempts to reform the United Nations and
circumventing its Security Council. It has also thwarted efforts to
create a new European security architecture, as called for in the
Charter of Paris, thus forcing Europe to accept NATO's ``security''
services.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kosovo conflict, the United States has defied the opinion
of Russia, China and India, which together represent half the
population of the world. It has shown its European allies that
Europe remains a political dwarf, that even its economic might
cannot stop U.S. hegemony. That, today, is how Washington envisions
a new world order.
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior has already done serious damage to the
international system. The danger is becoming real that the Yugoslav
tragedy could engulf the entire Balkan region and even all of
Europe. Even if the conflict is stopped soon, it is clear that the
world could hardly go back to what it was before March 23.
</P>
<P>
   A new arms race appears inevitable. There are dozens of
countries where this ``model'' can be replicated _ creating and
exacerbating latent conflicts and then ``settling'' them with
bombs, cruise missiles and ``surgical strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, there was an imperfect world order based on
international organizations trying to resolve crises politically.
Now, nations will want to rely on arsenals of weapons. And since
sophisticated modern weapons are too expensive for most countries,
they will not play by the rules of the rich; instead, they will
seek weapons of mass destruction _ nuclear, chemical and
biological, which can be cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, terrorism _ the cheapest weapon. No one can hope
to protect themselves from this dread threat with purely technical
or military means.
</P>
<P>
   It should be clear to all that this is a road to disaster. Not
only Russian politicians but most ordinary Russians as well have
been badly shaken by the conflict. It is giving ammunition to the
forces of the past, those who were always against new thinking and
resented any reforms, any cooperation with the West.
</P>
<P>
   I am convinced that the Russian people are wise enough not to
allow their country to be drawn into a war. But it would be
irresponsible to ignore the fact that the danger of a wider
conflagration is growing. Of course, we should keep a clear head,
but Russia will now have to rethink a great deal in its strategy,
its treaties and certainly its relations with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   It will now be impossible to overcome the crisis at no cost _
but overcome it we must. The way out is to resume efforts to build
a new world order based on equitable cooperation of different
civilizations. No one has given NATO the kind of functions that it
has arrogated to itself and seems ready to proclaim as the basis of
its new doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Washington must resist the urge to try to manage increasing
global complexity with police operations. We must not condemn the
world to disorder.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In the three weeks of war in the Balkans it is estimated that
NATO planes have flown 6,000 missions and 800 cruise missiles have
been launched.
</P>
<P>
   The tragic result is that the Kosovo conflict has turned into a
catastrophe, with hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians leaving
their homes and enduring appalling hardships. Many of them have
died in bombings or in the crossfire of fighting between the Kosovo
Liberation Army and Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   With the war sowing death and destruction throughout Yugoslavia,
the damage to it has been estimated at $200 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the conflict, many people warned that a military
operation against Yugoslavia would be a mistake, an unwarranted and
disproportionate measure, and urged a political solution. NATO took
a different course, which has resulted in an ignominious failure _
a defeat for NATO and for the policy of force generally.
</P>
<P>
   This could have untold consequences for Yugoslavia and for all
of Europe, unless urgent steps are taken to stop this madness.
Henry Kissinger, who was initially critical of President Clinton's
actions, is now saying that if NATO is to avoid breaking up it
cannot afford a defeat in Yugoslavia. He is apparently little
concerned about what would happen to the Albanians or to the Serbs
in the event of NATOs ``victory.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the leaders of the alliance speak of a political
solution, they in fact mean Yugoslavia's capitulation. But that is
just another dangerous illusion, a way to unpredictable,
catastrophic developments. The only alternative to a wider conflict
is a search for compromise.
</P>
<P>
   As I am writing this, news agencies report that the Turkish
authorities are conducting a major offensive against Kurdish
rebels. The long-seething conflict has erupted with fresh force,
but no one is saying a word. What will the United States and NATO
do? Give more weapons to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   And in Colombia, another friend of the United States, where
20,000 people die each year and the number of refugees has exceeded
1 million, even U.S. newspapers are wondering why the United States
chooses to ignore the responsibility of Colombia's government for
that tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, why? This is more than just a double standard. A much
broader hidden agenda is now being revealed. It is clear that the
Kosovo problem could have been resolved politically and that NATO's
military action can only make things worse. It is also clear that
this is a no-win situation for Europe.
</P>
<P>
   So why was the United States in such a hurry, why was it not
interested in political solutions? On the eve of NATO's 50th
anniversary, the Kosovo conflict is cynically being used to show
the world who's the boss.
</P>
<P>
   The international community is given to understand that the U.N.
Security Council and other international organizations are
ineffective, indeed helpless, thus forcing the United States to
``lead'' in this way. Even worse, to make arbitrary action look
legitimate, the conflict is being internationalized and other
countries are drawn into it, in a way that compromises them. But
that logic is fatally flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Soviet Union ceased to exist, the United States
has been boycotting all attempts to reform the United Nations and
circumventing its Security Council. It has also thwarted efforts to
create a new European security architecture, as called for in the
Charter of Paris, thus forcing Europe to accept NATO's ``security''
services.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kosovo conflict, the United States has defied the opinion
of Russia, China and India, which together represent half the
population of the world. It has shown its European allies that
Europe remains a political dwarf, that even its economic might
cannot stop U.S. hegemony. That, today, is how Washington envisions
a new world order.
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior has already done serious damage to the
international system. The danger is becoming real that the Yugoslav
tragedy could engulf the entire Balkan region and even all of
Europe. Even if the conflict is stopped soon, it is clear that the
world could hardly go back to what it was before March 23.
</P>
<P>
   A new arms race appears inevitable. There are dozens of
countries where this ``model'' can be replicated _ creating and
exacerbating latent conflicts and then ``settling'' them with
bombs, cruise missiles and ``surgical strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, there was an imperfect world order based on
international organizations trying to resolve crises politically.
Now, nations will want to rely on arsenals of weapons. And since
sophisticated modern weapons are too expensive for most countries,
they will not play by the rules of the rich; instead, they will
seek weapons of mass destruction _ nuclear, chemical and
biological, which can be cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, terrorism _ the cheapest weapon. No one can hope
to protect themselves from this dread threat with purely technical
or military means.
</P>
<P>
   It should be clear to all that this is a road to disaster. Not
only Russian politicians but most ordinary Russians as well have
been badly shaken by the conflict. It is giving ammunition to the
forces of the past, those who were always against new thinking and
resented any reforms, any cooperation with the West.
</P>
<P>
   I am convinced that the Russian people are wise enough not to
allow their country to be drawn into a war. But it would be
irresponsible to ignore the fact that the danger of a wider
conflagration is growing. Of course, we should keep a clear head,
but Russia will now have to rethink a great deal in its strategy,
its treaties and certainly its relations with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   It will now be impossible to overcome the crisis at no cost _
but overcome it we must. The way out is to resume efforts to build
a new world order based on equitable cooperation of different
civilizations. No one has given NATO the kind of functions that it
has arrogated to itself and seems ready to proclaim as the basis of
its new doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Washington must resist the urge to try to manage increasing
global complexity with police operations. We must not condemn the
world to disorder.

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, April 20.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ASHTEKAR-PHYSICS (Undated) _ Scientist at Work: Dr. Abhay
Ashtekar, the leader of a worldwide effort to unify the two most
profound, abstract and mathematically baroque theories of physics
discovered in this century, now is explaining his work in a
six-month workshop in California. His passion boils down to this:
An attempt at creating a sort of cosmic nouvelle cuisine by merging
Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity with the laws of
quantum mechanics. By James Glanz. (2250 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MERCK-MANUAL (Undated) _ The first edition of the Merck
Manual, the venerable medical textbook first published in 1899, was
reissued this week in a commemorative centennial package along with
the 1999 edition. On seeing it, there is a surge of relief that we
have come so far. Back in 1899 a patient with asthma might well
have marched under doctors' orders directly to the tobacconist for
a cigarette: ``smoking is sometimes beneficial'' for this
condition, the manual reports. An alcoholic might have been dosed
up with opium, or sent off to suck an orange and drink a pint of
hot water before meals to curb his craving. For baldness, the
doctor might have suggested applying ammonia to the bare pate
(``very useful'') or taking a little arsenic by mouth. By Abigail
Zuger, M.D. (925 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PLANETARY-SYSTEMS (Undated) _ A major discovery announced
last week has given birth to a new field of science, the
comparative study of planetary systems. At last, after centuries of
speculation, often more fanciful than scientific, and recent years
of expectant searching, astronomers have found a family of planets
to compare the solar system with. They detected three large planets
_ two of them with masses much greater than Jupiter's _ orbiting
another solar-type star, Upsilon Andromedae, 44 light-years away.
Scientists confidently predict that this will be the first of many
similar discoveries. By John Nole Wilford. (1550 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PARKINSONS-FETAL (Undated) _ In a controversial experiment,
half the subjects in a study of Parkinson's patients underwent
brain surgery to have fetal cells implanted in their brains. The
other half had the surgery but received nothing. On Wednesday,
results of the controversial experiment will become available and
those receiving the placebo will decide if they want to try the
real thing. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg. (1600 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRAIN-PLASTICITY (Undated) _ In a fascinating set of
experiments, researchers at the Center for the Neural Basis of
Cognition in Pittsburgh have found a way to teach native speakers
of Japanese to reliabaly hear the difference between ``L'' and
``R'' _ after just one hour of training. The new findings are
``extremely compelling,'' said Dr. Edward Jones, a neuroscientist
at the University of California at Davis and president of the
Cognitive Neuroscience Society, who is familiar with the research.
They shed light on how the adult brain changes - a phenomenon
called plasticity _ and on mechanisms that make it resistant to
change. The experiments show that the adult brain is capable of
substantial change, even late in life. By Sandra Blakeslee. (1400
words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ Short items on science: the speed of tiny
shrimplike crustaceans, genetically engineered crops and a new
record for the most distant galaxy ever viewed. (650 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GOD-DEBATE (Washington) _ What if Jerry Springer decided to
do a show pitting one particle physicist who believed in God
against another who did not? And if he asked them to hash out,
before a live audience, whether the universe is the product of
divine design? The result might be something like the refreshingly
rousing debate between the Nobel Prize laureate Steven Weinberg and
the knighted physicist-turned-theologian John Polkinghorne that
invigorated hundreds of people here at a conference meant to bring
science and religion closer together, and highlighted the current
twists on an age-old dispute.God and science seminar. By Carey
Goldberg. (1280 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GIANT-BACTERIA (Undated) _ German, Spanish and U.S.
researchers have discovered the largest bacteria ever found,
according to an article published Friday in the journal Science.
The giant bacteria, found off the coast of Namibia, are 100 times
bigger than the previous record-holders and in some cases are even
visible to the naked eye. By Henry Fountain. (900 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health column: Recent
studies have highlighted a wide variety of foods and beverages that
offer the promise of a healthier heart, often with other protective
benefits as well. In fact, if weight is not a problem, some people
may not have to eat low-fat at all, as long as the fats they eat
are the right kinds of fats. An overview of foods shown to have
healthful results. By Jane E. Brody. (1340 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AIDS-RESEARCH (Sydney, Australia) _ The hopes of researchers
in seeking a non-virulent strain of HIV. By Lawrence K. Altman.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-LYMPH-NODES (Undated) _ A new procedure for testing the
lymph nodes of women with early-stage breast cancer is so promising
and is gaining in popularity so rapidly that leaders in the field
are concerned that some surgeons may try it without being properly
trained. And any errors that result can be fatal. By Holcolm B.
Noble. (640 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-SCULLING (Undated) _ A look a sculling, by a novice
inspired by Tori Murden of Louisville, Ky., who last summer set out
from North Carolina in a 23-foot boat hoping to become the first
woman to row across the Atlantic solo. A former collegiate sculler,
Ms. Murden rowed for 85 days and was two-thirds of the way across
when Hurricane Danielle forced her to give up. A look at the sport,
which involves rowing with two oars or sculls. Although there are
two- and four-person boats for sculling, it is most often a
solitary pursuit. By Martha Barnette. (1350 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-STEROIDS (Undated) _ Two new anabolic steroids appear to
have helped kidney dialysis and AIDS patients regain some of the
weight they had been losing uncontrollably as a result of the
illnesses. This discovery represent a return to the original
purposes for which the drugs were developed. By Holcolm B. Noble.
(900 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PHARMACOGENOMICS (Undated) _ The ten pharmaceutical
companies that announced last week they were setting up a genome
mapping consortium are hoping to buy a seat at a revolution that
may soon start to sweep over their industry. But like all
revolutions the impending advance, known as pharmacogenomics, is
unlikely to be bloodless. The basic idea is to match patients, on
the basis of a genetic test, to the drugs that will do them most
good and least harm. By Nicholas Wade. (1300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Short takes on health and fitness:
</P>

KENWORTH GEARING UP FOR THE TRUCK OF TOMORROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BILL VIRGIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Kenworth Truck Co.'s new version of its T2000 probably
has a better home video, audio and computer system than your house,
and a better security-surveillance system.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, your house can't do 60 on an interstate.
</P>
<P>
   Kenworth's advanced technology truck has been making the rounds
of shows and customers, giving drivers and fleet operators the
chance to ogle such gee-whiz touches as dual cup holders that offer
individual hot/cold temperature controls for the driver and the
passenger.
</P>
<P>
   But Kenworth's truck is loaded with some serious-minded
technology, like cameras that give the driver a view of the blind
spot along the right side of the trailer.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a serious business purpose to Kirkland, Wash.-based
Kenworth tricking up a heavy duty truck with technology that puts
most people's homes to shame. The 42-inch flat-panel television in
the sleeper cab might seem like a frill, but Kenworth has as solid
a business reason for putting that on a truck as it does installing
the camera system.
</P>
<P>
   Those who write the checks for new trucks ``are quite willing to
spend money on improving safety and anything that improves the
lives of drivers,'' says Jim Mele, editorial director of Fleet
Owner magazine. ``In those two areas, the wallets are open.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kenworth, the advanced technology truck is a way of showing
fleet owners and drivers what's possible and finding out from them
what they're likely to want on future trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Brown is one of those who has looked the truck over. Brown
is the chairman of Contract Freighters Inc. in Joplin, Mo., which
operates 1,900 trucks, the majority of them Kenworths.
</P>
<P>
   He started driving trucks 35 years ago; he remembers trucks that
have required manipulating two levers to shift gears, had no power
steering or air conditioning (or if they did the a.c. usually
didn't work or dripped water on the driver). He also remembers
driving as a team in a truck equipped with a 24-inch bunk. ``I'm
wider than 24 inches,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So Brown looks at trucks with the eyes of both a driver and an
operator. ``We continue to look for new technology that enhances
productivity, reduces costs and improves safety,'' he says. At the
same time time, he says, anything that makes the life of the driver
more comfortable, ``I support.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the features in the new Kenworth truck that caught
Brown's eye was a dashboard system for providing directions. ``It's
something our drivers are concerned with each time we pick up a
load'' in unfamiliar territory, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Another is a computerized driver log. Instead of fumbling with a
pencil-and-paper log, the driver can enter information at a touch
of a button; not only does the system record mileage data and other
information, it can also shoot it back to the home office. ``You
don't have the age-old problem of time lapse,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks of the future may also free drivers from doing a lot of
the shifting with what's known as an automated transmission. It
differs from an automatic transmission in that the driver still
uses a clutch. ``You use the clutch once when you start, once when
you stop,'' says Ted Scherzinger, who is with Kenworth's advanced
concepts group (but who describes his job as ``they let me build
nice trucks'').
</P>
<P>
   In between starting and stopping, the driver can use a steering
column-mounted control to tell the transmission to shift up or down
or maintain a particular gear.
</P>
<P>
   Automated transmissions aren't cheap, but fleet owners think
those systems allow drivers to concentrate on the road, Mele says.
``I thought drivers would be the last ones to give up that
multispeed gear box, but drivers like it,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   To improve safety, Kenworth is showing off a sophisticated
vision system that features miniature cameras in the side mirrors
and on the outside of the sleeper; that will be valuable for
eliminating blind spots, changing lanes, backing up and turning
tight corners.
</P>
<P>
   Future enhancements to the vision system will reduce the glare
of headlights and allow drivers to ``see'' beyond their headlights
or through fog. The system might also enhance the image to provide
more information to the driver; if that car on the right is closing
in dangerously, the vision system might highlight it with a bright
color.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the cameras were a nicety, but I've heard a lot of
big operators say `we need to get these on trucks now,''' says Dan
Farmer, Kenworth's assistant chief engineer. They're interested in
having cameras record what's going on outside the truck, for
liability protection.
</P>
<P>
   Truck comforts have come a long way from the days of that
24-inch bunk in the truck Brown drove, and more are on the way.
Kenworth's model truck features an alphabet soup of consumer
electronics _ DVD, VCR and CDs, not to mention satellite and
Internet links.
</P>
<P>
   Those features are not just for flash. The trucking industry
continues to face a problem in recruiting and retaining drivers;
fleet owners figure that with drivers virtually living in their
trucks while they're on the road, making those trucks more
comfortable might help attract and keep employees.
</P>
<P>
   Kenworth officials acknowledge that at least some of what
they're showing isn't cost-effective now for most customers.
</P>
<P>
   But Scherzinger says it's worth it to Kenworth to understand the
technology now. It's likely to become less expensive, and when it
does Kenworth wants to have done the work on how to incorporate
that technology into a truck.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of off-the-shelf technology also hasn't been readied for
the rough environment, with vibrations and extreme temperature
swings, of the commercial truck `You can't just take a laptop PC,
strap it down to the seat and expect it to live,'' Scherzinger
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the technology is available but not in the form we
want to put in the truck,'' Farmer adds. Consider global
positioning systems, for example. GPS technology is readily
available, but Kenworth wants a system that provides information to
the driver without requiring him to do a lot. ``You can overload
the truck; you can overload the driver,'' Farmer says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact some of Kenworth's new information systems are designed
to provide less, not more. If the rear axle temperature is fine,
the information panel won't bother the driver with a gauge telling
him that. That way, as Brown puts it, ``drivers can deal with
exceptions rather than the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Truck manufacturers have other reasons for getting a head start
on tomorrow's technology. Right now, with a glut of orders and
strong backlogs, truck builders like Kenworth (a unit of Bellevue,
Wash.-based Paccar Inc.) are manufacturing trucks as fast as they
can.
</P>
<P>
   For several years the industry has defied forecasts of a
slowdown. But eventually those forecasts will prove to be right,
and truck makers will want to hold on to market share, or even
seize a few percentage points from competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a truck with all the bells and whistles can be
important'' to build market share, says Paul Latta, research
analyst with McAdams Wright Ragen Inc. in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   As feature-intensive as the advanced technology truck is,
Kenworth has hardly drained the well of potential improvements. Ed
Caudill, Kenworth's general manager, has been talking to groups
about such innovations as electronically programmed engines (so
that fleet operators could change the horsepower of a truck
depending on whether it was operating in the mountains or the
plains) and radar warning systems for tracking the speed and
distance to other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   One interesting technology that may show up on a future Kenworth
``truck of the future'' is ``brake by wire,'' using electronics
instead of pneumatic systems to activate a truck's brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic braking could get the signal to the brakes faster
than conventional systems, and balance the braking over the wheels
of the tractor and trailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brake by wire is a no-brainer,'' Brown says. ``If you can fly
a 747 or a jet fighter without attached cables, it makes sense to
me you should be able to do the same thing with a
tractor-trailer.''

WHY MUSLIMS ARE DRAWN TO MAKE A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME PILGRIMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TARA DOOLEY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five times a day for most of his 38 years, Hasan Hasan-Ali has
knelt and prayed toward Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a child and a teen in Kuwait, this receptacle of
prayer was a city in a neighboring country to the southwest _ the
most holy city of the Islamic faith and the dwelling place of the
``House of God.''
</P>
<P>
   When he became a student and later an engineer in Texas, Mecca,
though geographically farther than before, remained central to his
daily thoughts, his rituals, his faith.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, for the first time, Hasan-Ali beheld Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like something I've been looking for all my life,''
Hasan-Ali said. ``You feel the presence of God, and you feel like
crying.''
</P>
<P>
   For Muslims, making a pilgrimage to Mecca _ a hajj _ is a
once-in-a-lifetime obligation of faith for all who can gather the
money and strength for the journey. Annually, it attracts more than
2 million of the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   During the five-day ritual, believers aim to follow in the
footsteps of Abraham and Mohammed, chief prophets in Islamic
tradition. But the goal of the journey is to repent of sins and
return home with a renewed devotion to God and commitment to
leading a pious life, said Imam Mohamed El Ajami, the spiritual
leader of Dar Eleman mosque in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hajj that God accepts, there is no reward but paradise,''
said El Ajami.
</P>
<P>
   Mecca is a city in southwest Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Muslim teachings, it is also where God told
Abraham to build a house, or what tradition refers to as the Ka'ba.
The area is also where God is said to have told Abraham to
sacrifice his son, Ishmael, who was saved at the last minute by the
hand of God. (Jewish and Christian teachings hold that Isaac was
that son.)
</P>
<P>
   According to the Koran, the prophet Mohammed considered the
Ka'ba to be the house of God and instructed Muslims to pray toward
it. Shortly before his death in 632, Mohammed made a pilgrimage to
Mecca, setting the pattern for the hajj.
</P>
<P>
   While participating in the hajj, Muslims are urged to shed
worldly concerns and concentrate on their devotion to God, said
Associate Professor Yushau Sodiq, who teaches Islam in the Texas
Christian University religious studies department.
</P>
<P>
   But the hajj also unites Muslims from distant countries,
creating an Islamic Ummah, or community. Though women can wear what
they want, men shed their street clothes and wear an ihram, or two
white sheetlike pieces of cloth, intended to eliminate social
distinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Status is unified,'' Sodiq said. ``Everyone is equal before
God.''
</P>
<P>
   And they are also made humble before God.
</P>
<P>
   ``After going through this experience, I feel that if I thank
God every second of my life, that is not enough,'' said Colleyville
resident Abdul Rashid Khan, who recently returned from the hajj
with his wife, Zohra Khan.
</P>
<P>
   Though all the rituals are performed in a period of about five
days, the main portion is conducted on the ninth day of ``the month
of hajj.'' This year, the five-day observance took place March
25-29. The time of year it occurs changes annually because the
Islamic calendar is based on the lunar cycles.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important moments of the hajj takes place in
Arafat, outside of Mecca, Khan said. Here, pilgrims spend most of
the day praying outside, which means they find themselves in
temperatures as high as 100 degrees, given the time of year. At
sunset, the pilgrims move to Muzdalifah, where they pray for
forgiveness throughout the night, without shelter and surrounded by
millions of unknown faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very frightening,'' Zohra Khan said. ``It gives one the
perspective of the reality of how the day of judgment is going to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Another important ritual of the hajj is one in which pilgrims
pray as they circle the Ka'ba seven times surrounded by throngs of
people, each trying to get close to the black stone that sits to
one side of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a strange feeling you don't have in regular
life,'' Hasan-Ali said. ``... You are next to others, there is no
room, no space. It's an emotional sea that everyone gets into.''
</P>
<P>
   Though a spiritual journey, there are practical matters to
attend to when traveling from Texas to the center of Islam, and
those require some planning.
</P>
<P>
   Hasan-Ali decided a year ago that he needed to attempt the hajj
while he is still young and strong. So he started planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the feeling, an urge, that I needed to do it,''
Hasan-Ali said. ``This year I decided, `This is it. No matter what,
I'm going.' ''
</P>
<P>
   An engineer for Parkland Hospital in Dallas, Hasan-Ali took
nearly three weeks off and traveled to Mecca with Dar El-Eiman, an
international company with three U.S. offices.
</P>
<P>
   For between $2,700 and $6,500, Dar El-Eiman handles everything
from securing visas and booking hotels to planning meals and
arranging transportation within Saudi Arabia, said Fawaz Mushtaha,
company vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone who makes it to Mecca for the hajj can afford the
accommodations or has the connections to make the arrangements.
Hasan-Ali said he saw pilgrims sleeping on medians in the street,
unable to find or pay for hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans, in particular, seem to have an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia grants visas for the hajj based on the percentage
of a country's population that practices Islam, said Tarik
Allagany, information supervisor for the Royal Embassy of Saudi
Arabia in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims in American make up a relatively small percentage of the
population, meaning most who want to make the trip can. And often
they have an opportunity to make the journey more than once.
</P>
<P>
   In some Islamic countries, there are waiting lists, and most
pilgrims usually get to make the journey only once in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``You leave your heart there,'' said Yassin Siyyadeh, a
Carrollton resident and a Dar Eleman mosque member who this year
made his second hajj. ``I've tried to explain that, but I don't
think there is a word in my dictionary.''
</P>
<P>
   Though perhaps inexpressible, it is a sentiment Hasan-Ali would
probably understand. Despite still fighting a flu that he picked up
from a lack of sleep and the proximity to 2 million people,
Hasan-Ali said he will probably return _ next time with his wife,
Tamie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to do it exactly like the prophet did,'' he said.
``... Like everything you do, the first time is not perfect, so you
want to do it again.''

   SCI-ASHTEKAR-PHYSICS (Undated) _ Scientist at Work: Dr. Abhay
Ashtekar, the leader of a worldwide effort to unify the two most
profound, abstract and mathematically baroque theories of physics
discovered in this century, now is explaining his work in a
six-month workshop in California. His passion boils down to this:
An attempt at creating a sort of cosmic nouvelle cuisine by merging
Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity with the laws of
quantum mechanics. By James Glanz. (2250 words)

<P>
   SCI-MERCK-MANUAL (Undated) _ The first edition of the Merck
Manual, the venerable medical textbook first published in 1899, was
reissued this week in a commemorative centennial package along with
the 1999 edition. On seeing it, there is a surge of relief that we
have come so far. Back in 1899 a patient with asthma might well
have marched under doctors' orders directly to the tobacconist for
a cigarette: ``smoking is sometimes beneficial'' for this
condition, the manual reports. An alcoholic might have been dosed
up with opium, or sent off to suck an orange and drink a pint of
hot water before meals to curb his craving. For baldness, the
doctor might have suggested applying ammonia to the bare pate
(``very useful'') or taking a little arsenic by mouth. By Abigail
Zuger, M.D. (925 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PLANETARY-SYSTEMS (Undated) _ A major discovery announced
last week has given birth to a new field of science, the
comparative study of planetary systems. At last, after centuries of
speculation, often more fanciful than scientific, and recent years
of expectant searching, astronomers have found a family of planets
to compare the solar system with. They detected three large planets
_ two of them with masses much greater than Jupiter's _ orbiting
another solar-type star, Upsilon Andromedae, 44 light-years away.
Scientists confidently predict that this will be the first of many
similar discoveries. By John Nole Wilford. (1550 words)

   SCI-PARKINSONS-FETAL (Undated) _ In a controversial experiment,
half the subjects in a study of Parkinson's patients underwent
brain surgery to have fetal cells implanted in their brains. The
other half had the surgery but received nothing. On Wednesday,
results of the controversial experiment will become available and
those receiving the placebo will decide if they want to try the
real thing. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg. (1600 words)

<P>
   SCI-BRAIN-PLASTICITY (Undated) _ In a fascinating set of
experiments, researchers at the Center for the Neural Basis of
Cognition in Pittsburgh have found a way to teach native speakers
of Japanese to reliabaly hear the difference between ``L'' and
``R'' _ after just one hour of training. The new findings are
``extremely compelling,'' said Dr. Edward Jones, a neuroscientist
at the University of California at Davis and president of the
Cognitive Neuroscience Society, who is familiar with the research.
They shed light on how the adult brain changes - a phenomenon
called plasticity _ and on mechanisms that make it resistant to

   SCI-GOD-DEBATE (Washington) _ What if Jerry Springer decided to
do a show pitting one particle physicist who believed in God
against another who did not? And if he asked them to hash out,
before a live audience, whether the universe is the product of
divine design? The result might be something like the refreshingly
rousing debate between the Nobel Prize laureate Steven Weinberg and
the knighted physicist-turned-theologian John Polkinghorne that
invigorated hundreds of people here at a conference meant to bring
science and religion closer together, and highlighted the current
twists on an age-old dispute.God and science seminar. By Carey

   SCI-GIANT-BACTERIA (Undated) _ German, Spanish and U.S.
researchers have discovered the largest bacteria ever found,
according to an article published Friday in the journal Science.
The giant bacteria, found off the coast of Namibia, are 100 times
bigger than the previous record-holders and in some cases are even
visible to the naked eye. By Henry Fountain. (900 words)

   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health column: Recent
studies have highlighted a wide variety of foods and beverages that
offer the promise of a healthier heart, often with other protective
benefits as well. In fact, if weight is not a problem, some people
may not have to eat low-fat at all, as long as the fats they eat
are the right kinds of fats. An overview of foods shown to have
healthful results. By Jane E. Brody. (1340 words)

</P>
<P>
   SCI-LYMPH-NODES (Undated) _ A new procedure for testing the
lymph nodes of women with early-stage breast cancer is so promising
and is gaining in popularity so rapidly that leaders in the field
are concerned that some surgeons may try it without being properly
trained. And any errors that result can be fatal. By Holcolm B.

inspired by Tori Murden of Louisville, Ky., who last summer set out
from North Carolina in a 23-foot boat hoping to become the first
woman to row across the Atlantic solo. A former collegiate sculler,
Ms. Murden rowed for 85 days and was two-thirds of the way across
when Hurricane Danielle forced her to give up. A look at the sport,
which involves rowing with two oars or sculls. Although there are
two- and four-person boats for sculling, it is most often a

COMMENTARY 
 
BETWEEN IRS AND FOES, BUSH TAXED BY TAXES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ These are taxing times for would-be presidents,
and they promise to get worse.
</P>
<P>
   The $3.77 million federal tax payment that Gov. George W. Bush
and his wife, Laura, coughed up was enough to inflict pain, even on
someone who made an estimated $18.4 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the man is always crying out for ``tax relief.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Internal Revenue Service will probably be the least
taxing ordeal that the governor will encounter as he continues to
gear up his White House campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Early front-runners, as we all know, don't always win the big
prize, but they certainly serve a practical purpose in the
meantime. They are tasty entrees for non-front-runners, the media
and just about everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   As is already obvious, every effort will be made by reporters
and Bush's political opponents to uncover and regurgitate his
distant past.
</P>
<P>
   In the present tense, his leadership capabilities also will be
questioned if state lawmakers _ who are eagerly heeding his plea to
be boring _ don't follow through on his other legislative
priorities as well.
</P>
<P>
   And with six weeks remaining in the legislative session, Bush's
scorecard will soon start taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most controversial items on his wish list, a bill to
require parents to be notified before their minor daughters can
have abortions, is scheduled for a committee hearing this week in
the House, where a similar bill got derailed two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters are optimistic that the measure, which already has
won Senate approval, will make it to the governor's desk this time.
But if the bill fails again, there will be a lot of chattering
about how Bush failed to deliver on a key promise to the Republican
Party's right wing and seriously damaged his chances to win the
party's White House nomination.
</P>
<P>
   All of which may or may not prove to be true.
</P>
<P>
   A bill to use tax-backed vouchers to pay private school tuition
for some Texas students _ another high-profile Bush priority _ is
struggling but isn't dead yet.
</P>
<P>
   Although the governor may take some of the blame for a voucher
failure, it may pose less political damage for Bush than for Lt.
Gov. Rick Perry, who has been a much stronger advocate for vouchers
but isn't running for president.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there is the matter of tax relief, which may
prove to be the biggest problem on Bush's gubernatorial record,
less for what happens this spring than for what Bush tried to do
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature will reduce taxes this year. But the reduction
will likely be less than the $2.7 billion cut Bush proposed during
his re-election campaign, thanks to a lower-than-anticipated budget
surplus. And lawmakers may rearrange the governor's tax cut
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The governor will take whatever tax cut the Legislature gives
him and use it to try to bolster his national campaign _ or
minimize any damage he incurred on the tax issue during the 1997
session. That was when he tried to trade higher state taxes for
lower local property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature rejected Bush's ambitious tax plan and a revised
tax overhaul that he also supported two years ago. In the end,
lawmakers simply raised the homestead exemption on school property
taxes, and Bush declared victory, bragging that he had cut Texans'
taxes by $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, that was the savings. But each individual
homeowner saved only about $140 a year, and many taxpayers never
saw that much because some school districts ate up the savings by
raising their tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is potentially vulnerable on taxes because of his proposed
1997 trade-off. He proposed cutting school property taxes by almost
$3 billion a year in exchange for raising the state sales tax by
one-half cent per dollar and substituting a controversial, general
business tax for the more limited corporate franchise tax.
</P>
<P>
   The governor would have used a budget surplus to produce an
overall, net tax reduction. And he could be commended for trying to
improve an outdated state tax structure.
</P>
<P>
   But good policy doesn't always make for good politics. Other
presidential contenders will ignore the tax cuts and attempted
trade-offs and simply fire away at the tax increases that were in
Bush's plan.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican opponent, Steve Forbes, already has called Bush
``that tax man in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush certainly doesn't consider that a fair characterization.
But if such attacks keep coming _ and they probably will _ he may
find them more annoying than even the IRS.

   WINSCOTT RANCH, Texas _ On a windswept pasture of bluebonnets
and spring grasses, 16 longhorn steers are in ``spring training''
of sorts. They're being prepared to become living reminders of Fort
Worth's cowtown heritage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two of the herd's newest recruits proved their agility and
independence one day last week by jumping a 4-foot barbed-wire
fence to a dramatic, but short-lived, freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The two steers were part of the herd that was unloaded in a
holding pen on Ed Bass' Winscott Ranch in southwest Tarrant County,
where the cows will be settled and trained before moving to their
permanent home in the Fort Worth Stockyards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of work to do before we get them down there,''
trail boss Dennis Merrell said after the wayward steers were
reunited with the herd. ``But this is the day we've been waiting
for. The cowhands are ready, the horses are trained, we're ready to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrell said he and his crew will work daily with the herd until
its public debut June 12 when the longhorns will be driven from
downtown to the Stockyards as part of Fort Worth's sesquicentennial
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the herd program is to teach tourists the
significance of the cattle industry in Fort Worth's 150-year
history through authentic re-enactments of cattle drives and
exposure to the herd.
</P>
<P>
   Cowhands will drive part of the herd through the Stockyards to
the Trinity River each day, beginning in June. Part of the herd
will remain in pens for display.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as impressive a herd as I've ever seen,'' said herd
historian and curator Tom B. Saunders. ``They are just tremendous
looking.''
</P>
<P>
   Saunders, whose family has been in the cattle business for
generations, said it will take time to settle the new herd. They
are big and used to going where they please, he said of the massive
steers. ``That is the nature of the beast,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got a good mixture here,'' he said. ``The colors
really depict the diversity of the breed. The horn size shows they
are sure enough, straight-blooded Texas longhorn cattle.''
</P>
<P>
   The steers range in age from 5 to 15 years, weigh between 1,700
and 2,000 pounds and have horn spans of 4 to 6 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Laughing at the short but exciting escape of the two steers,
Saunders recalled what the ``old-timers'' often said about the
longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look awfully clumsy just standing around,'' he remembered
the old cowhands saying. ``But they are as quick as a cat, as fast
as a deer, and they have the disposition of a grizzly bear.''
</P>
<P>
   The herd was first assembled in South Texas a month ago. Ned and
Curley, two veterans of the 1995 Great American Cattle Drive from
Fort Worth to Miles City, Mont., were the first members, donated by
Bob and Mary Mike McKenzie of Aledo.
</P>
<P>
   The two steers were sent to the El Coyote ranch in South Texas
where they were joined by the rest of the herd, donated by several
others including the King Ranch, and Lee and Ramona Bass, owners of
El Coyote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to feed them and let them settle a little,''
Merrell said. ``We're going to let them get used to the horses.
They've been together for awhile, but they were on a 2,500-acre
pasture all by themselves. This is a little different.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrell said he and Saunders also will work with the Texas and
Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association on an elementary school
curriculum that explains the importance of the cattle industry to
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Merrell, Saunders and the entire crew will be on hand Thursday
at a special Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce luncheon at the
Stockyards Station Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices and additional information can be obtained by
calling the chamber at (817) 336-2491, Ext. 231.

THESE BACTERIA ARE SO BIG, THE MICROSCOPE'S OPTIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heide Schulz remembers thinking that the single-cell organism
she examined under a microscope that day back in 1997 was unusual.
Sifted from sulfurous muck on the ocean floor off the coast of
Namibia in Africa, it seemed to be a microbe.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Schulz, a doctoral student at the Max Planck Institute
for Marine Microbiology in Bremen, Germany, was astonished at its
size.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought maybe it was an unhealthy bacterium, because it was
so large,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But the bacterium, and countless others from the same sample,
were more than healthy. They were downright robust, stuffed with
sulfur granules that gave off a whitish gleam. In a microbial world
of Matchbox cars, Ms. Schulz was looking at a monster truck. She
had stumbled across the biggest bacteria ever found.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria, which Ms. Schulz named Thiomargarita namibiensis,
or sulfur pearl of Namibia, range in diameter up to about
one-thirtieth of an inch, or roughly the size of the period at the
end of this sentence. They are orders of magnitude larger than most
other bacteria, and in volume are up to 70 times bigger than the
previous record-holder, a microbe found in the guts of surgeonfish.
</P>
<P>
   The newly discovered strain wallows in the slime of the Atlantic
off the African coast, playing a crucial role in a poorly
understood cycle of decay of these sediments that are rich in
organic matter yet poor in oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   It feasts on sulfide, oxidizing it with nitrates contained in a
huge storage chamber, or vacuole, that makes up the bulk of the
cell.
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria are prokaryotic, meaning they consist of tissue called
cytoplasm, a membrane to contain it, and little else. Unlike
eukaryotes, they lack sophisticated internal structures to
transport nutrients and wastes, relying instead on diffusion. A
large ratio of surface area to volume is thus very important in
bacteria, and effectively limits their size, since the ratio
declines as size increases.
</P>
<P>
   The new bacteria do not have an enormous amount of cytoplasm,
said Bo Barker Jorgensen, the director of the institute and a
co-author of the paper announcing the discovery in the current
issue of the journal Science. ``But they are cheating,'' he said.
``The cytoplasm is only a thin sheath along the periphery. The rest
is just a storage tank.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria are under intense pressure to maximize ways to survive
in their environment, said Dr. James Ferry, a professor of
microbiology at Pennsylvania State University and editor of The
Journal of Bacteriology. Ordinarily, he said, large size would be a
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   But thiomargarita's odd fondness for sulfide is its saving
grace. ``This organism occupies a very specific niche,'' Ferry
said. ``Since it has no competitors, it does not have to have a
large surface-to-volume ratio to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   The organic sediments in which the bacteria were found resemble
those off the coast of Chile, and are the result of similar
processes involving coastal upwelling of nutrient-rich water.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schulz and her colleagues had come to Namibia, in fact, in
hopes of finding thioploca, a sulfide-eating strain of bacteria
they had found off South America. While there was little evidence
of thioploca in the African sediments, they soon realized that
thiomargarita was a close relative. It had just evolved
differently.
</P>
<P>
   Thioploca are smaller and mobile, moving about within long
filaments. They shuttle between the sediments, where they pick up
sulfide, and the sea water, where they find the nitrates they need.
</P>
<P>
   The African bacteria, by contrast, stay only in the mud, which
would seem to limit their access to nitrates. But they solve that
problem by having a huge tank _ the vacuole, which stores a two- to
three-month nitrate supply _ and refueling every so often as huge
undersea waves cause an oscillating flow of water, in effect
pumping it into the sediments.
</P>
<P>
   The strain's role in consuming sulfide could be critical to
maintaining an ecological balance on the ocean floor, Jorgensen
said. In certain concentrations, hydrogen sulfide gas can be toxic
to bottom-dwelling fish and other creatures. ``As long as bacteria
are there, and have the capacity to oxidize the sulfide, they can
keep it down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is that role, more than the bacterium's exotic size, that
makes it of lasting interest to researchers. Given the great
diversity of microorganisms and the paltry amount that is known
about them, in fact, many scientists might greet the news of a
giant microbe with a large yawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``A microbiologist would shrug this off and say, `See, since we
know so little about the microbiological world, this isn't
surprising,''' Ferry said.

THE CUTTING EDGE OF MEDICINE, FROM A CENTURY AGO 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ABIGAIL ZUGER, M.D.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Go to the zoo and gaze deep into the eyes of a chimpanzee, and
you will know exactly how it feels to leaf through the first
edition of the Merck Manual, the venerable medical textbook first
published in 1899 and reissued this week in a commemorative
centennial package along with the 1999 edition.
</P>
<P>
   There is that same fascination at something so alien and
primitive, that same surge of relief that we have come so far ...
and that same sudden flash of recognition too _ isn't that just a
little touch of Grandpa around the hairline?
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1899 a patient with asthma might well have marched under
doctors' orders directly to the tobacconist for a cigarette:
``smoking is sometimes beneficial'' for this condition, the manual
reports. An alcoholic might have been dosed up with opium, or sent
off to suck an orange and drink a pint of hot water before meals to
curb his craving.
</P>
<P>
   For baldness, the doctor might have suggested applying ammonia
to the bare pate (``very useful'') or taking a little arsenic by
mouth. For the common cold _ inhale some formaldehyde and call me
in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   A male patient complaining of uncontrollable sexual urges would
probably have been diagnosed with satyriasis in 1899 and handed a
prescription for a potent sedative, heavily laden with alcohol. No
such luck for the woman hauled into the doctor's office and found
to suffer from nymphomania, who would instead have gotten herself
medicated with sulfuric acid, camphor or tobacco (``so as to cause
nausea: effectual but depressing,'' noted the gentlemen at Merck.)
</P>
<P>
   Historians usually date the beginning of modern scientific
medicine to just after World War II, when a crescendo of advances
in drug development and medical technology merged into the general
outlines of the medicine we know today. But it would be a mistake
to assume that doctors a hundred years ago were moping around their
consultation rooms, wringing their hands and waiting for penicillin
to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Far from it: they were as busy and active as could be, poring
over long lists of available treatment options and making
complicated, optimistic plans. In fact, the number of substances
with claimed medical utility had grown so large by then that the
Merck pharmaceutical company was inspired to compile them in this
slim volume: it could slip out of the doctor's pocket for easy
reference when memory failed _ and could also, incidentally, keep
the name ``Merck'' right under the doctor's nose.
</P>
<P>
   For typhoid fever (the responsible germ had been discovered 15
years before, but antibiotics were still decades away), the
up-to-date medico of 1899 had 85 separate treatments to choose
from, including morphine, opium and cold baths. For puerperal
fever, the dreaded strep infection that killed women after
childbirth, the doctor had more than 40 treatment options,
including blood-letting and chloroform.
</P>
<P>
   For tuberculous meningitis, a brain infection that was once a
scourge of infancy and even with today's powerful antibiotics can
still be fatal, treatments to try included iodine and turpentine
massaged into the skin.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, among the hundreds of nostrums and poisons once
lavishly dispensed in the name of healing, a few alternatives still
ring true. Doctors could treat diphtheria with strychnine, ice and
lemon juice in 1899, but they could also choose diphtheria
antitoxin, which is still a cornerstone of diphtheria treatment.
</P>
<P>
   They could opt for quinine for malaria and digitalis for heart
failure; they could use saccharin to sweeten diabetics' food and
codeine to soothe coughs; they could write for chloral hydrate for
insomnia and colchicine for gout, as doctors are still doing today.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 edition of the Merck text is massive next to the 1899
version, with 2,833 pages to the old one's 192. Almost 300 experts
from around the country were assembled to guarantee that it
reflects the cutting edge of modern therapeutics. The old volume
and the new one will be packaged together for the duration of 1999,
at $35 for the set.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the authoritative bulk of the new manual and all
those experts, the inexorable process of medical evolution grinds
on. When the next century rolls around, dialysis for kidney failure
may seem as dubious a procedure as bloodletting, hystamine blockers
like Zantac, Tagamet and Pepcid as bizarre a set of stomach
soothers as the inspissated ox gall that aided 1899 digestions, and
all our blood pressure medications as quaintly pointless as
tincture of cactus (a heart tonic in 1899).
</P>
<P>
   We have harnessed our own set of poisons for medical treatment;
in a hundred years a discussion of modern cancer chemotherapy may
read as chillingly as endorsements of strychnine for tuberculosis
and arsenic for diabetes do today.
</P>
<P>
   Like all medical textbooks, the new Merck manual is far too
heavy to tote around. No matter _ doctors at their present
evolutionary stage do not travel much in the course of a day's
work. Those who purchase the Merck set will undoubtedly keep the
new one on the office desk, while the old one gets a few laughs,
then gathers dust on a coffee table or library shelf.
</P>
<P>
   But actually, a better place for the 1899 edition might be right
back where it once belonged, in the doctor's pocket or pocketbook,
as a kind of professional memento mori _ a reminder that for all
the eager scampering around we all do these days in the name of
health care, most of it is no more likely to survive the march of
time than did our once prehensile toes.

The San Francisco Chronicle, whose articles are a part of The New
York Times News Service, is pleased to announce a new column,
``Learning to Cook,'' by well-known food writer Marion Cunningham. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Even in this food-savvy age, many people don't know how to cook.
Though supermarkets bulge with products unavailable just a decade
ago and TV cooking shows abound, many are embarrassed by their lack
of basic skills. For example, consider the divorced executive with
a recipe telling him to toss sliced apples in a bowl. He stood
across the room and threw in the pieces. Or the woman searching the
dairy case in vain for softened butter. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Marion Cunningham, who has been called the modern Fanny Farmer for
her work in revising two editions of that famous cookbook, offers
solutions for these novice cooks through the column and her new
book, also called ``Learning to Cook,'' to be published in May. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Beginning the week of April 19, the San Francisco Chronicle offers
``Learning to Cook,'' available regularly through The New York
Times News Service. The column, slugged BC-LEARING-TO-COOK-SFCHRON,
will move on Tuesdays with a ``d'' dining-category code. If you
have questions, feel free to call Holly Ocasio Rizzo at The
Chronicle, at (415) 777-8811. &QL;

 &HT;    CONGRESS URGED TO SAVE TOBACCO SETTLEMENT FOR THE STATES
 &HT;    By SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sens. Bob Graham and Kay Bailey Hutchinson joined
the National Governors Association on Monday in urging Congress to
keep the federal government from claiming states' tobacco
settlement money.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, D-Fla., and Hutchinson, R-Texas, made the appeal to a
House-Senate conference committee that is working on a compromise
version of an emergency spending bill. The bill contains items such
as such as hurricane aid to Central America and humanitarian
efforts in Kosovo in addition to the tobacco settlement measure.
</P>
<P>
   The states received $246 billion settlement from the tobacco
industry after suing it for reimbursement of medical costs. The
federal government contends it deserves 57 percent of the
settlement because of its contribution to the Medicaid health
insurance program for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Graham and Hutchinson introduced legislation in January to stop
the federal Health Care Financing Administration from seizing any
of the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every member of the Senate and the House of Representatives is
from a state that will be negatively affected if the federal
government succeeds in stealing what the states earned on their
own,'' Graham said at a news conference. ``It's bad federalism for
the federal government to step in now and dictate how states spend
money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're calling on the House to join the Senate in a united
voice to the federal government: Hands off the states' money,''
Hutchinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a states' rights issue,'' said Gov. John. G. Rowland
of Connecticut. ``State legislatures and governments should decide
how to spend the money and on what programs.''
</P>
<P>
   A letter to conference committee members signed by 30 senators
said that the fiscal 2000 budget that President Clinton submitted
in January assumed the federal government would recoup $18.9
billion from the tobacco settlement through cuts in Medicaid
payments to the states.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Senate Appropriations Committee included the
protection initiative in its version of the supplemental
appropriations bill. The Senate also defeated an amendment in March
that would have required states to spend part of their tobacco
settlement on certain goals.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said that Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida has proposed using the
state's tobacco settlement toward a $2 billion endowment named
after the late Gov. Lawton Chiles and aimed at children and older
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland added that many states are planning to spend the money
in a variety of ways, including anti-smoking programs, education,
and nursing home care.

STUDY DISCOUNTS RISKS OF MAD COW DISEASE THROUGH BLOOD PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A new study of more than 1,500 military veterans
who received blood products from people who later died from the
human equivalent of the mad cow disease has found no evidence that
any of them had the rare ailment.
</P>
<P>
   The study, presented Sunday at a conference of epidemiologists
in San Francisco, coincides with other inquiries that have yet to
find a documented case of Cruetzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is
transmitted by blood or blood products.
</P>
<P>
   However, the disease has been linked to transplants of infected
tissues, including corneas and brain material. An outbreak of the
disease in Great Britain has been linked to eating beef of infected
cows.
</P>
<P>
   In Cruetzfeldt-Jakob disease, as well as mad cow disease in
animals, spongelike holes form in the brain, leading to dementia
and death. Strange, misshapen proteins called prions are believed
to be responsible. They can be infectious, but scientists believe
they can also arise spontaneously from genetic mutations.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of California at San Francisco,
where prions were discovered, cautioned against drawing firm
conclusions from the study. For one thing, proving a negative _
that the disease is not passed through blood _ requires a very high
standard, said Fred E. Cohen, a UC-San Francisco scientist
researching prions.
</P>
<P>
   The study by researchers at the Department of Veterans Affairs
looked at death certificates from patients known to have gotten
blood products from people who later came down with the disease.
But death certificates are notoriously inaccurate, Cohen said,
especially when it comes to diagnosing rare diseases like
Cruetzfeldt-Jakob, which occurs in one person in a million each
year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Cohen said past research in animals has shown that
prions are probably carried in white blood cells at an early stage
of infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``One just needs to be extremely careful if the conclusion is
the blood supply is safe,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the study, Abid Rahman, an epidemiologist with the
Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Public Health, agreed that
the results don't prove that the disease cannot be transmitted via
blood. However, he said it appears there is only a ``small,
theoretical risk'' of getting it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It at least gives us some evidentiary basis for no
transmission through blood so far,'' Rahman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration banned blood products from
people with Cruetzfeldt-Jakob disease in 1995. However, the disease
can have a very long incubation period, so it may be many years
before it is discovered that someone who gave blood had the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the FDA considered a proposal to ban blood
donations from people who have spent time in Britain at the height
of the mad cow disease outbreak. A decision has yet to be made.

 By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ Dr. Abhay Ashtekar, the leader of a
worldwide effort to unify the two most profound, abstract and
mathematically baroque theories of physics discovered in this
century, is sprinkling frozen mango cubes on scoops of vanilla ice
cream.
</P>
<P>
   After a meal of fish and tamales during which he puttered about
his kitchen in a green apron emblazoned with bright flowers and the
words ``golden poppies,'' Ashtekar serves the dessert to his wife,
Christine Clarke, and two visitors while needlessly apologizing for
his cooking skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been able to follow a recipe,'' he says ruefully.
``I just add what seems right.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony in this bit of self-criticism is lost on no one at the
sun-splashed kitchen table. A flair for working without a recipe is
a necessity for pursuing the central scientific passion of
Ashtekar, who heads the Center for Gravitational Physics and
Geometry at Pennsylvania State University and is in town to help
organize a six-month workshop.
</P>
<P>
   His passion boils down to this: An attempt at creating a sort of
cosmic nouvelle cuisine by merging Albert Einstein's theory of
general relativity with the laws of quantum mechanics, which were
first worked out in the 1920s by a number of physicists including
Erwin Schrodinger, Paul Dirac, Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr and
Einstein. No recipe exists, and only a few of the ingredients are
known.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, these theories seem to explain the observed
universe, but they express profoundly different conceptions of
matter, time and space. That philosophical schism also leaves
physicists in deep doubt over how to deal with phenomena in which
both theories should be valid _ in the realms of the very small and
the very energetic, like the Big Bang in which the universe was
allegedly born.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two wildly successful theories that have defined
20th-century physics,'' said Dr. Gary Horowitz, a physicist at the
University of California at Santa Barbara, where the workshop is
being held through July. ``These theories are fundamentally
incomplete and inconsistent with each other, and we just can't go
on like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Relativity theory describes how the gravity of everything from
subatomic particles to massive stars distorts and curves the four
dimensions of space-time, like coconuts rolling on a rubber sheet.
That changing curvature, in turn, determines exactly how the
objects orbit about one another or fall together.
</P>
<P>
   A large enough congregation of matter can collapse to a point of
infinite density, called a singularity, and shroud itself in a
sphere of darkness _ a black hole, whose gravity is so powerful
that nothing can escape from it, not even light.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, standard quantum mechanics tells the tale of
a ``flat'' space in which particles refuse to orbit smoothly;
instead, they can hop suddenly from one spot to another, carrying
with them only specific, sharply defined amounts of energy called
quanta, like tourists holding no bills smaller than a 20. And far
from respecting the crisp determinism of classical relativity,
these particles sometimes exist not at definite positions but
rather as fuzzy clouds of probability.
</P>
<P>
   In culinary terms, these two kinds of physics have remained as
distinct as a Tex-Mex barbecue and a New Age vegetarian picnic
taking place in the same park. But most physicists, like Ashtekar,
believe that since there is just one universe, there should be just
one fundamental way of describing it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roger Penrose of the University of Oxford said that both
theories also had internal problems, like the strange singularities
that form in general relativity and the unmanageable infinities
that also crop up in quantum mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation is that to resolve these issues, we need the
correct union between general relativity and quantum mechanics,''
Penrose said. ``In my view,'' he added, Ashtekar's approach ``is
the most important of all the attempts at `quantizing' general
relativity.''
</P>
<P>
   That approach has led to a daring conception of space-time that
shares characteristics with both the quantum world and general
relativity. On incredibly tiny scales _ 10-33 centimeters, or
smaller than a trillionth of a trillionth of the diameter of an
atom _ space-time becomes jagged and discontinuous.
</P>
<P>
   At those scales, Ashtekar said, space dissolves into a sort of
polymer network, ``like your shirt,'' which looks continuous from a
distance but is actually made of one-dimensional threads.
</P>
<P>
   These developments had their start in the 1980s with a
mathematical reformulation of Einstein's theory by Ashtekar, which
allowed it to be molded into something that looked like a modified
quantum theory. The equations that resulted were later shown to
predict the polymers by Ashtekar, Dr. Carlo Rovelli of the Center
for Theoretical Physics at the University of Marseilles in France
and Dr. Lee Smolin of Pennsylvania State University.
</P>
<P>
   Ashtekar freely points out that no one yet knows if this
conception is right and that nature has actually chosen to
fricassee space at the smallest scales. His approach to unification
is not even the most popular one; many elementary particle
physicists, including Horowitz, the Santa Barbara physicist, think
that vibrations of 10-dimensional entities called strings might
hold the key to all the forces of nature, including gravity.
</P>
<P>
   But because it uses relativity theory as its jumping-off point,
the approach dreamed up by Ashtekar and his colleagues is ``the
most in the spirit of Einstein,'' said Dr. Thomas Thiemann, a
physicist at the Albert Einstein Institute, a part of the Max
Planck Society in Potsdam, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Though known as a researcher of intimidating mathematical
prowess, Ashtekar, 49, seems to approach his metier without much
solemnity about its cosmic implications. After lunch, he sat
outside in brilliant sunlight near an orange tree, sipping tea,
shuffling through visual depictions of what the fabric of space
might be. On his mug, a Gary Larson cartoon showed a schoolboy
raising his hand in class and asking: ``Osborne, may I be excused?
My brain is full.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashtekar's light touch is more than a matter of style. Later,
when pressed, he shrugged off the almost religious significance
that some cosmologists have suggested a final theory will have.
``That arrogance is somewhat misplaced,'' he said. ``I personally
feel this is a great intellectual challenge; it's very difficult
and all that.'' But physics, he said, ``is only a part of the whole
mystery of nature, of existence and ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Abhay Ashtekar grew up in small cities in the Indian state of
Maharastra, which contains Bombay. At 15, while living in Kolhapur,
a town surrounded by lush green sugar cane fields, he came across
the popular book ``One, Two, Three ... Infinity'' (last printed in
1988 by Dover) by the physicist George Gamow and decided that he
liked mathematics and cosmology. Two years later (after the first
year of college in India), a math professor explained to him that
it was actually possible to make a living doing research on such
topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from a middle-class family, you either became a doctor
or an engineer or you entered civil service,'' Ashtekar said. The
notion of a career fiddling with ideas ``was a total revelation,''
he said. ``And my mind was set. I wanted to try to do pure
research.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He began showing a flair for not following scientific recipes
almost immediately, discovering a small but significant error in
the answer to a problem given in ``The Feynman Lectures on
Physics,'' a set of introductory volumes written by the late Dr.
Richard P. Feynman, a Nobel Prize winner. Ashtekar wrote to Feynman
_ and still has the treasured reply conceding that the textbook was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime later he walked into the United States consulate in
Bombay and searched university catalogs for graduate programs in
gravitation. He eventually landed, a very uncertain 20 years old,
at the University of Texas, Austin. On his first day on campus, he
had to work up his courage just to enter the physics building.
Eventually he entered, climbed a set a stairs, looked both ways
down a corridor and hurried out again.
</P>
<P>
   His confidence returned quickly. He went on to complete his PhD
at the University of Chicago, and then to appointments in Oxford,
Paris and Syracuse, N.Y., before settling at Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   Ashtekar gradually became interested in a field that many
theorists before him had entered at their peril. ``The history of
quantum gravity,'' wrote Dr. Rovelli of Marseilles in a recent
review, ``is a sequence of moments of great excitement followed by
great disappointments.''
</P>
<P>
   In an early attempt, Schrodinger announced in 1947 that he had
managed to unify Einstein's equations with the theory of
electromagnetic fields. But Einstein dismissed the work and
condemned the worldwide news coverage it had scored.
</P>
<P>
   From such episodes, wrote Einstein, ``the reader gets the
impression that every five minutes there is a revolution in
science, somewhat like the coups d'etat in some of the smaller
unstable republics.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Feynman and others tried to slip gravity into the quantum
version of electromagnetism that had been developed, but the hybrid
theory exploded with mathematical infinities when all the
interactions it permitted were added up. And in the heyday of a
unified theory called supergravity, Dr. Stephen W. Hawking, the
physicist at the University of Cambridge, gave a talk titled ``Is
the End of Physics in Sight?''
</P>
<P>
   It was not, yet, and when infinities reared their head in
supergravity, some of its ideas were salvaged and woven into string
theory.
</P>
<P>
   Ashtekar's approach, which drew in part on work in the 1960s by
Dr. John Wheeler of Princeton University, began with Einstein's
equations directly. Following his mathematical taste buds rather
than accepted formalisms, Ashtekar searched for some way to
transmute the theory's geometric spirit into the fuzzy quantum
world.
</P>
<P>
   His first step was to express Einstein's equations in terms of
variables with a chirality, or ``handedness,'' in which a circle
drawn in the clockwise sense would look different from one drawn in
the opposite sense. Against all intuition, Einstein's equations,
which show no preference for direction, broke into simpler pieces
in the Ashtekar variables.
</P>
<P>
   From that vantage, first achieved in 1986, he was able to use
straightforward tricks developed in the 1920s for creating a
quantum theory from a deterministic one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rather curious,'' said Dr. Chris Isham, a theorist at
Imperial College in London. ``At one level, it was simply a
redefinition of variables, which one might think was a fairly minor
thing to do. But it really rejuvenated the whole field and caused
quite an explosion of activity,'' Isham said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon there followed the solutions showing the polymerlike
structure of space. The interlocking polymers ``quantize'' space in
a particularly odd way, since each strand is somehow loaded with a
definite amount of cross-sectional area. So to figure out the area
inside a circle in this weird space, one would count up the strands
that puncture its surface and multiply by the quantum of area
carried by each of them. In this way, area is not smooth but comes
in bundles.
</P>
<P>
   The same rule holds for the area of a black hole's event
horizon, the place beyond which anything is drawn into the black
hole. Last year Ashtekar, Dr. John Baez of the University of
California at Riverside, Dr. Kirill Krasnov of Penn State and Dr.
Alejandro Corichi of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico
showed that the polymers running into a black hole in a sense hold
it ``still'' at the puncture points, like a water balloon supported
on blunt pins. The rest of the horizon is free to jiggle about
quantum mechanically.
</P>
<P>
   Like the bouncing and jiggling of atoms in an ordinary gas, such
motion has a definite entropy (or randomness) and therefore a
temperature. Drawing on earlier formulas obtained with Dr. Jerzy
Lewandowski of the University of Warsaw, Ashtekar and his
colleagues were able to calculate the entropy for a black hole,
matching a legendary 1974 prediction by Hawking.
</P>
<P>
   The theory has other bizarre consequences, such as a bending of
space that could be caused by immensely energetic photons of light.
But the theory still faces challenges, particularly in the
treatment of the ``time'' part of space-time. Until better
observational tests turn up, the furious bake-off whose prize is
unifying physics will remain a theoretical one.
</P>
<P>
   The entrants are not limited to strings and quantum geometry,
which are beginning to look almost conservative. Penrose of Oxford
believes that quantum mechanics itself will have to be modified
before a fully successful merger with relativity can be made. Dr.
Rafael Sorkin of Syracuse University is starting from scratch,
postulating bits of existence he calls ``the atoms of space-time''
and working upward toward the macroscopic laws of physics.
</P>
<P>
   In his side yard, Ashtekar, after a brief disappearance, brings
a late afternoon snack for his visitors. It is a reminder that no
matter what package of formulas emerges, he is likely to be
kneading and rolling them in his mathematical kitchen, so to speak,
with results that could not be predicted by looking at the picture
on the box.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What if Jerry Springer decided to do a show pitting
one particle physicist who believed in God against another who did
not? And if he asked them to hash out, before a live audience,
whether the universe is the product of divine design?
</P>
<P>
   The result might be something like the refreshingly rousing
debate between the Nobel Prize laureate Steven Weinberg and the
knighted physicist-turned-theologian John Polkinghorne that
invigorated hundreds of people here at a conference meant to bring
science and religion closer together, and highlighted the current
twists on an age-old dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was almost waiting for it to deteriorate into a physical
fight,'' said Janice Herndon, a Georgetown University student who
attended the conference with her science and religion class, when
it was over. ``I think it was pretty much a draw.''
</P>
<P>
   Her professor, John Haught, added, ``I think it was a little
classier than Jerry Springer.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a little livelier than the making nice-nice between
scientists and religionists that has typified the recent rash of
such conferences, courses and panels.
</P>
<P>
   Propelled by intriguing advances in cosmology and by millions of
dollars from the Templeton Foundation, efforts to build a
``constructive dialogue'' between science and religion have
proliferated of late, attacking big ``Why are we here?'' questions
and conveying a sense that it has never seemed more like 3 a.m. in
the dorm room of America.
</P>
<P>
   The encounters are sometimes-awkward mixes that touch on topics
like the possible overlap between physicists' assertions that the
universe's laws seem fine-tuned to allow human existence and
theologians' ideas about a caring creator.
</P>
<P>
   Bah, humbug, said Weinberg, almost in so many words. He does not
even believe, he said, that there should be a ``constructive
dialogue'' between science and religion at all, because that
``could help to give religion a kind of legitimacy it shouldn't
have.'' And as for the Templeton money and the mounting
science-and-religion trend, ``I deplore it,'' he said, and
predicted that it would peter out.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not keep Weinberg from happily taking on his old
Cantabrigian friend, Reverend Polkinghorne, in a debate ranging
from quantum mechanics to morality.
</P>
<P>
   The match, held in the same Smithsonian Museum of Natural
History auditorium as a famous 1920 debate on the size of the
universe between Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, became something
of a centerpiece for the three-day ``Cosmic Questions'' conference
put on by the American Association for the Advancement of Science
and the Templeton Foundation. Its agenda was to explore three jumbo
questions: Was there a beginning? Is the universe designed? And are
we alone?
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Polkinghorne-Weinberg debate, cosmologists generally
discussed their findings and unanswered questions about the early
universe in purely scientific terms, while theologians referred
largely to text and God, and there was a powerful sense that never
the twain shall meet.
</P>
<P>
   But Polkinghorne and Weinberg actually engaged. And though
Weinberg asserted that most scientists he knew did not even think
enough about religion to call themselves atheists, their statements
did illuminate how recent cosmological findings influence the
choice between belief and unbelief, for those who do bother to
think about it.
</P>
<P>
   These days, as Polkinghorne put it, given the state of knowledge
about the seemingly fine-tuned laws of the universe, ``there are
two broad categories of possible explanations: Either there are
many universes, and ours is one by chance, or there is a single
universe that is the way it is'' because a creator wanted it that
way.
</P>
<P>
   Both those ideas, he emphasized, are metaphysical in character.
On that, Weinberg agreed, noting that the ``anthropic'' reasoning
that focuses on the human-size universe ``may be mystical mumbo
jumbo or it may be just common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are open questions,'' Weinberg said. ``Are the constants
of nature remarkably well-adjusted for the existence of life?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't know enough yet about fundamental physics to
answer that,'' he said, though noting that he was not particularly
impressed with some of the more commonly used examples of physical
laws that seemed peculiarly sized to allow human existence, like
the energy levels of the carbon nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Polkinghorne allowed that he did not think it
could be proven that God existed, or that God did not exist, for
that matter.
</P>
<P>
   So the two were left to argue pretty much on the basis of taste.
</P>
<P>
   Although religion has done some good, ``its influence on balance
has been awful,'' Weinberg said. ``With or without religion,'' he
said, ``you would have good people doing good things and evil
people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things,
that takes religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Polkinghorne countered that religious revelation and
transformation had also led evil people to do good things.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Polkinghorne argued, science by itself cannot answer
a metaphysical question like whether the universe is designed, just
as physics cannot ``explain'' music by describing it as vibrations.
Some things, he said, cannot be condensed ``into a formula that can
be written on a T-shirt,'' and there could be no simple answers for
questions as deep as why science is possible at all _ that is, why
the universe is intelligible _ and why the universe seems so
special.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, he said, ``I do believe religious belief can
explain more than unbelief can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Belief in God, he said, can explain not only the existence of
the universe, and its intelligibility, but also the widespread
phenomenon of religious experience and the dawning of consciousness
in humans, which he sees as a ``signal of meaningfulness.'' Beauty
and morality, too, ``find a natural anchorage'' in God as a
starting point, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And as for the eternal question of why there is evil in a world
created by a benevolent God, ``science has been moderately helpful
to theology'' on that count, Polkinghorne said, by coming up with a
theory of evolution that allowed theologians to argue that ``God
created a world that could make itself,'' and was no direct
puppeteer.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg critiqued theological theory as being ``infinitely
flexible,'' while physics at least had logical rigidity. So that as
observational data and physicists' thinking advances, it will _
perhaps soon _ become clear whether there really are a vast number
of universes, he said, and that will not be a matter of personal
taste, and ``won't be an act of faith,'' but ``will be a deduction
from laws which unfortunately, at the present, we do not know.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg even allowed that he was going out on a limb by
positing a Godless universe, given that the facts on which he based
his opinion could change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly in this auditorium, a flaming sword may come down''
and strike him dead, he said, ``and then we'll know the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Heaven forfend, Polkinghorne responded. That would be a terrible
theological problem for him, he said, because he does not believe
in the kind of God who would do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be not only a theological problem, but a janitorial
problem,'' Weinberg added.

<P>
   Pity the Japanese tourist asking for directions in New York
City: ``Which way to Times Square?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer might be: ``Turn left after the next light.''
</P>
<P>
   The next what? Does that mean traffic signal or the next street
turning off to the right? To the typical native speaker of
Japanese, right and light are hopelessly confused because the
English sounds ``L'' and ``R'' are indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   But they won't be confused for long. In a fascinating set of
experiments, researchers at the Center for the Neural Basis of
Cognition in Pittsburgh have found a way to teach native speakers
of Japanese to hear the difference between L and R reliably after
just one hour of training.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings are ``extremely compelling,'' said Dr. Edward
Jones, a neuroscientist at the University of California at Davis
and president of the Cognitive Neuroscience Society, who is
familiar with the research. They shed light on how the adult brain
changes, a phenomenon called plasticity, and on mechanisms that
make it resistant to change.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Helen Neville, a leading expert on brain plasticity at the
University of Oregon in Eugene, called the experiments ``cool.''
They show that the adult brain is capable of substantial change,
even late in life, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The research is being conducted by Dr. Jay McClelland and his
colleagues at the Pittsburgh center, a joint program of Carnegie
Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. McClelland, the
center's co-director, has long been interested in how the brain
learns and, sometimes more importantly, how it fails to learn.
</P>
<P>
   He presented his findings last week at the annual meeting of the
Cognitive Neuroscience Society, which was held in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The brain presents a puzzle, McClelland said, in that many kinds
of learning continue or even improve throughout adulthood, but
others, like the speech sounds of a language, appear to slow almost
to a stop. Few people can learn a second language without an accent
after the age of 10.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists call this 10-year window a critical period for
acquiring the sounds of a language. But what is the neural basis of
this critical period?
</P>
<P>
   Clues are found in the way brain cells connect and influence one
another. In test tube experiments, scientists take two nerve cells
that are connected by a kind of cable called an axon. When the
first cell is induced to fire an electric pulse down its axon, the
second cell also fires. Soon, physical changes develop in both
cells so that the first one almost always makes the second one
fire. This is how information is passed throughout the brain in a
process known as Hebbian learning.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, brain cells are not well connected, McClelland said.
But when experiences from the outside world begin to flow into the
brain, cells begin to fire, and Hebbian patterns get stamped in. As
neuroscientists are fond of saying, cells that fire together, wire
together, forming circuits.
</P>
<P>
   Later, a cell may come into direct contact with cells from
another circuit, but if it is committed to what it has learned, it
will not respond even to very strong stimulation from those other
cells. In other words, it fails to learn.
</P>
<P>
   This model of Hebbian learning can be applied to the sounds of
human language, McClelland said. Newborn babies can discriminate
all the sounds of every language in the world. It is as if there
were a space inside their brains that is a blank slate, waiting for
sounds to enter.
</P>
<P>
   When the sounds of the native language come pouring in, each
sound induces some cells to wire up and become dedicated to its
peculiar frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, there are clumps of cells that are tuned to the Finnish
``O,'' the Spanish ``D'' or the English ``Th'' _ all of which are
difficult for non-native speakers to hear or pronounce. Within a
short time, the baby's ability to distinguish all sounds fades
away.
</P>
<P>
   Babies in English-speaking families have cells dedicated to
hearing both L and R, whereas Japanese babies have only one
phonetic category for a similar sound, McClelland said. To an
American, the single Japanese R sound, as in the word riokan,
meaning guest room, sounds rather like a D, he said. In any case,
as the children in both cultures grow up, their sound categories
become more sharply defined.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The brain has a relatively small amount of neural tissue
dedicated to speech sounds, McClelland said, and so carves up that
space with strong boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds are stamped in early because the baby needs them to build
the foundation for language comprehension. Thus, Hebbian processes
come in early and lock in speech sound circuits. In other parts of
the brain, Hebbian processes continue, but those circuits can be
more flexible, he said.
</P>
<P>
   An adult learns to speak a second language by making new
connections in many circuits but cannot supplant the locked-in
native sound system with the new sounds of the second language.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the unfamiliar sounds of a foreign language actually
reinforce the sound system of one's native language, McClelland
said. When a Japanese speaker comes to America, every time he hears
an English L or R, his single Japanese R phoneme is activated.
Instead of becoming more flexible, his ability to hear L and R
diminishes with increasing exposure to English.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, McClelland said, is to carve out two spaces in
the Japanese speaker's brain when he has only one space for the L
and R sounds. If the critical period is over forever, he said, this
should be impossible. But if some plasticity or malleability
remains, there should be a way to override the embedded circuits
using Hebbian learning.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four native Japanese speakers came to the Pittsburgh
laboratory, where they were given headphones through which they
heard pairs of words _ road and load, light and right, and so on _
under one of two conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In one condition, subjects heard regular speech. They had to say
or guess when they heard an L-word or R-word by tapping a response
into a laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   In the second condition, subjects heard the same words
exaggerated by a computer, so that each sound's peculiar frequency
or formant was accentuated. As their ability to distinguish L and R
words improved, the words were presented in regular speech.
Finally, they heard the words in sloppy or degraded speech so that
even native speakers would have to listen hard to hear the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   The subjects, all of whom had great trouble with L and R before
training, used the computer for three 20-minutes sessions,
involving hundreds of word pairs, McClelland said. No feedback was
offered, to make conditions resemble the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Those who heard natural speech barely improved and some actually
got worse, McClelland said. But those who heard the exaggerated
speech with gradual training toward more natural speech all
improved greatly. After one hour, they could clearly distinguish
light and right.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the successful subjects do not generalize what
they have learned to all L and R sounds, he said. But the
experiment is just beginning. If they go on to train on numerous
pairs of words, they may be able to retrain their entire sound
system. It appears that they have begun to carve out new,
independent circuits for the L and R sounds.
</P>
<P>
   This approach may be effective for retraining other embedded
circuits, like those that underlie racial prejudices or
stereotypes, McClelland said. For example, some people react with
fear when they see a stranger, based simply on his dress or skin
color. That response may be stamped in. ``We could think about ways
of structuring situations to present a stimulus that would
originally elicit the fear response and then teach the brain to
have a different reaction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And it can definitely be used for second language training.
</P>
<P>
   During the World War II, American soldiers fighting the Japanese
infantry adopted the password ``lollapalooza,'' figuring no
Japanese speaker could pronounce it. So much for that idea.

PERSONAL HEALTH: THERE'S PLENTY OF CHOICE IN DIET FOR HEALTHIER
HEART 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is your cholesterol level a little too high? Have you been told
to de-fat your diet or take costly medicines to bring it down?
</P>
<P>
   Eating a la Dr. Dean Ornish (about 10 percent of calories from
fat) is too much of a challenge for most people, and many currently
healthy people would rather not take cholesterol-lowering
medications (all have some side effects) if there are safe,
effective and more pleasant options for achieving a desirable
cholesterol level and a reduced risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies have highlighted a wide variety of foods and
beverages that offer the promise of a healthier heart, often with
other protective benefits as well. In fact, if weight is not a
problem, you may not have to eat low-fat at all, as long as the
fats you eat are the right kinds of fats.
</P>
<P>
   Good Fats, Bad Fats
</P>
<P>
   Don't assume that any of the choices below is the Holy Grail
that will allow you to subsist on a cheeseburger-and-fries diet.
Saturated fats must still be kept to a minimum. They are found in
significant amounts in chicken fat (30 percent saturated),
vegetable shortening (31 percent), lard (40 percent), beef fat (50
percent) and butter (62 percent).
</P>
<P>
   However, in a special report published in November by the
journal Postgraduate Medicine, Dr. Lisa Hark, director of the
nutrition education and prevention program at the University of
Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia, said that reducing
total dietary fat appeared to be less effective in lowering
coronary risk than simply replacing saturated fat with unsaturated
fat and consuming less trans fats, which act in the body like
saturated fat and are formed when unsaturated vegetable oils are
partially hydrogenated.
</P>
<P>
   Data from the continuing Nurses' Health Study showed that every
5 percent increase in saturated fat in the diet resulted in a 17
percent increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease.
</P>
<P>
   Heart-healthy fats include those found in fish, olives,
avocados, seeds and nuts. For cooking and salad dressings, you can
choose among olive, canola, sesame-seed, peanut and walnut oils.
But be sure to use them with discretion. Even heart-healthy oils
are high in calories, about 120 calories a tablespoon, and if you
gain weight, your cholesterol level and coronary risk will rise.
For a table spread, choose a margarine that is trans-fat free.
</P>
<P>
   Heart-Healthy Foods
</P>
<P>
   You've no doubt heard about any number of foods and drinks
purported to be good for the heart: fish, soy, whole grains,
various fruits and vegetables, garlic, alcohol and particularly red
wine. Here's the current scoop:
</P>
<P>
   FISH Just one fish meal a week may cut in half a man's risk of
sudden cardiac death. The Physicians' Health Study found that men
who ate fish _ for example, shellfish, canned tuna, salmon,
sardines, mackerel, herring, bluefish or swordfish _ at least once
a week reduced their risk of sudden death by 52 percent when
compared with men who ate fish less than once a month.
</P>
<P>
   Eating fish more often than once a week did not further reduce
the risk, but those who benefited most consumed fish as part of an
overall low-fat diet. Eating fish appears to protect against fatal
abnormal heart rhythms and the oils in fish reduce the risk of
arterial clogging.
</P>
<P>
   SOY FOODS Eating soy protein daily can lower the blood level of
heart-damaging LDL cholesterol and raise protective HDL
cholesterol. However, a lot of soy protein is needed to achieve a
significant improvement _ between 25 and 50 grams a day. One ounce
of powdered soy protein contains 23 grams, 4 ounces of tempeh has
17 grams, 4 ounces of tofu has 6 to 13 grams and 1 cup of soy milk
has 4 to 10 grams.
</P>
<P>
   The beneficial substances in soy appear to be plant estrogens
called isoflavones, anti-oxidants which may have an added benefit
of reducing the risk of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   WHOLE GRAINS A continuing study of more than 34,000
postmenopausal women in Iowa has shown that eating one or more
servings of whole-grain foods (in place of refined grains) can
reduce the risk of death from heart disease by a third.
</P>
<P>
   Such foods include cereals like Wheaties, Cheerios and Shredded
Wheat, brown rice, oatmeal, corn, bran, wheat germ, and breads in
which the first ingredient listed is whole wheat. Check the
nutrition information label and look for cereals with 3 to 6 grams
of fiber and breads with 2 grams of fiber per serving.
</P>
<P>
   SOLUBLE FIBER Foods rich in soluble fiber reduce cholesterol by
increasing its excretion. Last month Kellogg Co. introduced grain
products, under the trade name Ensemble, that are enriched with
psyllium, the soluble fiber in the stool softener Metamucil. If you
try psyllium-rich foods, introduce them gradually, be sure to
consume plenty of liquid with your meal and don't be surprised if
they increase intestinal gas and bowel frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Other foods rich in heart-protective soluble fiber include dried
beans and peas, oats and oat bran, barley, apples, citrus fruits,
corn and flaxseed. Flaxseed, which should be ground to produce its
full benefits, also contains the kind of heart-protective oil found
in fish and substances called lignins that may act as cancer
blockers. Ground flaxseed can be added to cereal, yogurt and the
batter for pancakes, breads and other baked goods.
</P>
<P>
   SUPPLEMENTS The study of Iowa women also highlighted dietary
calcium, either from foods or from supplements, as a
heart-protective, probably because it helps lower blood pressure.
Most helpful was a diet that contained more than 1,400 milligrams
of calcium a day, about the amount in a quart of skim milk or
yogurt or calcium-fortified orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   A dietary supplement, Chinese red-yeast-rice, sold as Cholestin,
contains the same cholesterol-lowering compounds found in the
statin drugs. It is highly effective and much cheaper than the
statins, but it may have the same potential side effects of liver
and muscle damage, and the Food and Drug Administration is trying
to reclassify it as a drug.
</P>
<P>
   Two B vitamins _ folate and B-6 _ may reduce the risk of fatal
heart attacks by lowering blood levels of a substance called
homocysteine, which, like high cholesterol, damages coronary
arteries. Good sources of folate include dark green leafy
vegetables, dried beans and peas, orange juice, fortified
whole-grain cereals and breads and multivitamin supplements. B-6 is
found in whole-grain cereals, bananas, beef, chicken and vitamin
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   A clove of garlic a day can be beneficial as well. But if a
dried deodorized garlic supplement is chosen, be sure it is
enteric-coated, which will protect it from stomach acid and allow
the formation of the odoriferous active ingredient that lowers
cholesterol and another blood fat, triglycerides.
</P>
<P>
   TEA AND ALCOHOL Tea, with or without caffeine, is beneficial to
the heart. Regular black tea is a rich source of flavonoids, the
protective anti-oxidants in soybeans that are believed to retard
the development of atherosclerosis. In a study of nearly 700 men
and women in Boston, those who drank one or more cups of regular
(not herbal) tea a day had nearly half the risk of suffering a
heart attack of those who drank no tea.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate consumption of alcohol, one drink a day, has been
linked in numerous studies to a reduced risk of heart disease, a
benefit that apparently results from an alcohol-induced rise in
protective HDL cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have singled out red wine as especially beneficial
because of anti-oxidant and anti-clotting substances in the skins
of red grapes. These substances are also present in purple grape
juice, which may also reduce the risk of atherosclerosis by keeping
LDL cholesterol from attaching to coronary arteries.

NAME, RANK AND JOB REFERENCES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the employment world, there aren't many things as frustrating
as making a bad hire _ except maybe firing that bad employee.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the pain, managers go out of their way to make sure
they don't hire a dud. But that's not so easy any more because
companies are very reluctant to comment on the job performance of
previous employees.
</P>
<P>
   Employers have been warned for years by their lawyers that they
shouldn't reveal any information _ good or bad _ about a former
employee. That way, they don't have to defend the truthfulness of
Joe's bad attendance problem or Sue's inability to get along with
co-workers in a defamation lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, companies typically will reveal only the dates of
employment and the position held by the former employee, commonly
known as ``name, rank and serial number,'' in human resource
circles. But that means another company gets stuck with the same
problem employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're giving references, we give as little as possible,''
said Larry Williams, director of human resources for the Marek
Family of Cos., a Houston construction company. ``But if we're
getting references, we try to get as much as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   To ease the frustration that employers such as Williams face,
the Society of Human Resource Management has promoted legislation
across the country that would try to limit the liability of
employers who give out truthful references.
</P>
<P>
   The association has met with success: 32 states now have laws
that are supposed to make it easier for employers to give out
references.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, a reference-checking bill sailed through the House on
Wednesday in an overwhelming vote of support and will now head to
the Senate, where it apparently has some strong supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But even if it passes, don't be lulled into thinking that it's
OK to spill your guts about a former employee.
</P>
<P>
   Employers already are protected by the law if they give a
truthful reference, said T.J. Wray, an employment lawyer with
Fulbright &AMP; Jaworski in Houston. The bill doesn't eliminate the
problem that faces companies today: the cost of defending a
defamation case.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, employers don't often lose the defamation cases, Wray
said. They just don't give out references to avoid the cost of
spearheading a defense.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Obdyke, an employment lawyer in Austin who also represents
employers, agreed with Wray that the bill wouldn't prevent angry
former employers from filing defamation lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   But Obdyke, who has testified on behalf of the bill and is
shepherding it through the Legislature, said he hopes it will give
employers a measure of comfort to pass along comments about former
employees.
</P>
<P>
   But is the lawyer taking his own advice?
</P>
<P>
   In a touch of irony, Obdyke said that if the bill passes, he
will continue to advise his clients who want to avoid defending
themselves in defamation lawsuits that they better not say anything
about their former employees other than their dates of service and
position held.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe over time the statute would make employers feel more free
to disclose information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure _ which Rick Levy, legal director of the Texas
AFL-CIO, dubs the ``right-to-lie bill'' _ is opposed by trial
lawyers and labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   It might provide cover for employers to engage in blacklisting
of former employees, Levy said. But he suspects, like Wray, that it
won't free up the tongues of reticent employers frightened about
having to defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One human resource manager in Houston isn't counting on the bill
to give her carte blanche to discuss previous employment records.
</P>
<P>
   It's still too risky, she said, asking not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   If employers really wanted to make it safe to give references,
they need a law that gives them immunity from reference-related
lawsuits, Wray said. But then there would be the danger of some
unscrupulous employers _ a minuscule number, of course _ who would
use the legal shield to pass along false information.
</P>
<P>
   Or the Legislature could make it more difficult for former
employees to sue by raising the burden of proof or requiring
employees who lose to pay the legal defense bills of their
ex-employer.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the best thing is for employers to step up to the plate
and accept the risk of giving out references as the cost of doing
business, Wray said. It's to the advantage of the community to get
the information out and there probably wouldn't be a big rush to
the courthouse if employers gave out references.

CATHOLIC UNIVERSITIES IN TEXAS RESIST CLOSER TIES WITH VATICAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A Vatican effort to forge closer church ties
to Catholic universities could stifle academic freedom, impair the
ability to draw quality faculty and threaten some forms of student
grants and loans, the president of Texas' largest Catholic
university says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like being a Catholic school, but from where I sit, if some
of these proposals are approved, it would be very problematic for
us,'' said the Rev. John Moder, president of the 4,100-student St.
Mary's University in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Moder is one of several Catholic university presidents _
including those from Notre Dame, Fordham and Boston College _ who
are concerned about proposals made in a draft document scheduled to
be voted on this fall by U.S. Catholic bishops. It would affect 236
U.S. Catholic universities.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II has long been concerned with the growing
secularization of Catholic schools. Some institutions, for
instance, have removed crucifixes from their classrooms. The new
rules are meant to bring the universities back to their religious
roots.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals now in the draft that have raised concerns include:
</P>
<P>
   _Demanding that presidents of Catholic colleges be ``faithful
Catholics'' and take an oath of fidelity to the church.
</P>
<P>
   _Requiring theology professors to get certification to teach
from local bishops.
</P>
<P>
   _Urging that most of the faculty members be Catholics in good
standing and that most trustees be members of Catholic churches.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul, in a 1990 letter called ``Ex corde Ecclesiae''
(From the Heart of the Church), formally expressed his demand that
Catholic schools identify closely with their religious heritage. He
left it up to bishops of each nation to decide how to do that.
</P>
<P>
   American bishops approved a proposal in 1996 by a vote of 226-6.
But Vatican authorities rejected it in 1997, saying it lacked
``juridical,'' or legal, language needed for enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Milam Joseph, president of the 3,000-student
University of Dallas in Irving, said he has few concerns about the
draft document but will make final judgments when it's completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been proud of our Catholicity,'' he said. ``I'm
sure this whole matter can be worked out and can be very
beneficial.''
</P>
<P>
   Moder said his school also cherishes its Catholic roots. But if
the plan requires theology professors to receive permission from
local bishops to teach, it could raise questions about academic
freedom and threaten some forms of federal aid, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think many of us would be prepared to do without
federal student aid,'' Moder said.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of the students at St. Mary's and 90 percent at
the University of Dallas receive some form of federal or state aid,
school officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Monika K. Hellwig, executive director of the American
Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities, said she doesn't
believe that student aid programs would be threatened at Catholic
schools.
</P>
<P>
   More of a concern, she said, is that Catholic universities could
be ineligible to receive state grants available in New York,
Washington and some other states if there is too much church
control. The funds help build classrooms and pay for research
projects, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hellwig is a nonvoting member of the bishops' committee drawing
up the draft document.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're under the gun to explain to the Vatican why some of
these proposals can't be stated in a legal manner; they need to be
stated in a pastoral way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hellwig said the Vatican wants to add ``teeth'' to make the
requirements enforceable. But if the rules are stated in a legal
way, accrediting agencies and organizations that give schools
financial support could see the schools as answerable to an outside
religious power, the Vatican. Those groups require that the schools
be governed by an independent board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Kinsey, assistant to the president at St. Edward's
University in Austin, said the pope's concerns about the drift away
from Catholic connections are well-taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was that late in the 1960s a lot of lawyers were
giving Catholic schools advice to get arm's length from the
institutional church or they would not be able to get any federal
money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsey said most, but not all, presidents of Catholic-related
universities are Catholics. He said some proposals in the draft
document could hinder the schools' efforts to minister to students
of all faiths.
</P>
<P>
   James Patrick, provost of the College of St. Thomas More, a
small liberal arts Catholic college in Fort Worth, says most major
U.S. Catholic universities have been steadily drifting away from
their Catholic identity.
</P>
<P>
   His school, which has about 80 full- and part-time students,
emphasizes its Catholic heritage, and he would like to see larger
Catholic universities that have become more secular do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to restore Catholic education in this country,''
Patrick said.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Major Catholic universities in Texas
</P>
<P>
   University of Dallas, Irving, 3,000 students.
</P>
<P>

SEMINARY FILES SUIT OVER DIPLOMA LAW

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Sunday school teacher Alan Askins was in
search of a better understanding of the Bible when an advertisement
for Tyndale Theological Seminary in a Christian magazine caught his
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Askins said he was drawn to Tyndale's evening classes and low
cost _ ideal for a husband, father of three and investment firm
manager.
</P>
<P>
   More important, though, Askins said, ``It lined up with our
beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Askins, of Fort Worth, may never see the master of arts level
diploma he has worked toward for four years. State officials
contend that Tyndale is illegally awarding degrees without approval
from the state or one of three accreditation agencies recognized by
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't have recognition by one of those accrediting
bodies, they have to get approval from us to offer a degree,'' said
Ray Grasshoff, assistant director of media relations for the Texas
Higher Education Coordinating Board.
</P>
<P>
   Seminary President Mal Couch, who founded the school more than a
decade ago, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can't push the church on the state, the state has no
right to push itself on the church,'' Couch said last week at his
office at 6800 Brentwood Stair Road.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Tyndale has raised constitutional questions about the
state's role in regulating religion and is asking the courts to
decide.
</P>
<P>
   Through its parent company, HEB Ministries Inc., Tyndale has
sued the Coordinating Board and Commissioner Don W. Brown,
contending that the state is violating the Texas and U.S.
constitutions by requiring biblical schools to get state approval
or accreditation before awarding degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Bible Institute in Dallas and Hispanic Bible Institute
in San Antonio have joined as plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Tyndale sued after the state fined it $173,000 last summer under
a revised law that allows for hefty penalties against unaccredited
institutions granting degrees or using such academic terms as
``seminary.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Texas Education Code, post-secondary institutions may
not award degrees or credits toward degrees without a ``certificate
of authority'' from the Coordinating Board or accreditation by the
Commission on Colleges, Southern Association of Colleges and
Schools; the American Association of Bible Colleges; or the
Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Legislature broadened the law to include seminaries and
schools of law and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Tyndale became the first institution to be fined
under the revised law, for awarding 34 degrees and using
``seminary'' in its name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our law is designed to be a temporary oversight to protect the
public from fraudulent or substandard degrees while the institution
is working toward accreditation,'' said David Linkletter, associate
director for institutional certification at the Coordinating Board.
</P>
<P>
   Linkletter said the fine does not indicate that Tyndale is
``fraudulent or substandard.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, both parties appeared in court in Austin before state
District Judge Paul Davis to argue for a pretrial ruling on the
legal issues of the case. Davis is expected to rule within a few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth attorney Shelby Sharpe, who is representing Tyndale,
argued that the state is violating the institutions' freedoms of
speech, press and religion.
</P>
<P>
   The state said the regulations ``are aimed at ensuring a
baseline consistency among all institutions offering academic
degrees in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Flowers, chairman of the religion department at Texas
Christian University, said that the dispute raises constitutional
questions, but that it's not clear-cut. Flowers is also president
of the North Texas chapter of Americans United for Separation of
Church and State.
</P>
<P>
   To be accredited or certified, institutions may have to spend
more on a library or hire faculty from accredited institutions,
which can mean ``reshaping'' a school, Flowers said.
</P>
<P>
   But protecting the public from fraud is also a public concern,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets down to the definition of fraud,'' he said. ``Is
Tyndale defrauding people by using the word `diploma'? The
Coordinating Board thinks so. It is generally confusing for the
general public. But I'm not sure what we have here is malicious
fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   In almost 11 years, Tyndale has awarded about 600 certificates
and diplomas in studies ranging from missions to biblical
counseling. Students can take extension courses or study on campus
_ a building east of Handley Drive that houses six classrooms, a
small library, a modest bookstore and Seminary Fellowship Bible
Church.
</P>
<P>
   Couch said Tyndale has never sought accreditation from a
state-recognized agency because seminary leaders believe they
should not be required to obtain permission or direction on how to
teach religion courses. Tyndale is accredited through the
Association of Christian Colleges and Theological Schools, which
Couch says does not dictate school policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem with medical schools being accredited,''
Couch said. ``But when it comes to religion, that's personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch said he hopes the lawsuit will succeed in giving religious
institutions the option to operate without government interference.
</P>
<P>
   Askins, 43, a manager for Fidelity Investments in Dallas, said
he doesn't know whether he'll get credit for his work with a
diploma from Tyndale.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he doesn't, Askins said, he has no regrets about
choosing the seminary, which he credits with teaching him how to
interpret the Bible and how doctrine affects everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't matter,'' Askins said. ``It comes down to a
spiritual issue.''
</P>
<P>
   With or without a diploma, Askins said, ``at some point, God is
going to take me in the direction that he wants to.''

A DISCOVERY PROVIDES GRIST FOR PLANETARY COMPARISONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas, Mass.)  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A major discovery announced last week has given birth to a new
field of science, the comparative study of planetary systems.
</P>
<P>
   At last, after centuries of speculation, often more fanciful
than scientific, and recent years of expectant searching,
astronomers have found a family of planets to compare the solar
system with. They detected three large planets _ two of them with
masses much greater than Jupiter's _ orbiting another solar-type
star, Upsilon Andromedae, 44 light-years away.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists confidently predict that this will be the first of
many similar discoveries. Dr. Geoffrey Marcy of San Francisco State
University, leader of one of the discovery teams, has his eye on
another star, 55 Cancri, where there is mounting evidence of
multiple planetary companions. Observers are tracking other nearby
stars for planetary systems but are cautiously refraining from
making any claims.
</P>
<P>
   They are further encouraged by other discoveries over the last
four years. Examining the telltale motions of almost 20 other
stars, astronomers have inferred the presence of at least one
Jupiter-class planet close to each of them, exerting slight
gravitational disturbances. Smaller or more distant planets may
also accompany these stars, but their detection would require more
prolonged observations and may be beyond current technology.
</P>
<P>
   If there were astronomers with comparable technology in the
Upsilon Andromedae system, they would be unable to detect any of
the Sun's planets, not even mighty Jupiter, because they lack
sufficient mass or are too distant from the Sun. So it is possible,
scientists said, that observers have yet to take the full measure
and census of the Upsilon Andromedae system or others nearby in the
Milky Way galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Spacecraft being planned for flight in the next couple of
decades are expected to find many more planetary systems, including
any Earth-size objects that might harbor some forms of life.
</P>
<P>
   The Terrestrial Planet Finder, a mission planned by 2010, should
be able to detect and photograph the full retinue of planets around
other stars. Its instruments will also be designed to determine the
constituents of atmospheres, which could reveal signs that the
planets may be habitable.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 years later, a spacecraft called Life Finder, which is
being planned by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.,
would carry remote-sensing instruments for a more detailed study of
planet atmospheres. The presence of methane and ozone together, for
example, would be a sure sign of some kind of life on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretical astrophysicists have already seen enough, though, to
suspect that the sun and its family may not be a typical planetary
system. They have been surprised to find so many examples, at
Upsilon Andromedae and also among the solitary planet detections
around other stars, of Jupiter-class objects existing much closer
to their stars than Jupiter is to the sun. And none of the current
theories predicted what they discovered at Upsilon Andromedae: that
three such giant worlds could form and survive around a single
star.
</P>
<P>
   ``True giant planets are not that easy to form,'' said Dr.
Douglas Lin, a theorist at the University of California at Santa
Cruz. ``Finding three around one star, and extremely close to it,
is quite significant and puts more constraints, limits, on any
theory of planetary formation and evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan Boss, a theoretical planetary scientist at the Carnegie
Institution of Washington, noted that 10 times more mass is locked
up in the three Upsilon Andromedae giants than in all the planets
of the solar system. The innermost of these has a mass
three-quarters that of Jupiter, and the middle one a mass at least
twice Jupiter's. The outermost, at more than four times Jupiter's
mass, is not much farther from its star than Mars is from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried that our conventional ways of explaining giant
planets is inadequate,'' Boss said.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing that has not astonished astronomers is the
discovery itself of another planetary system. As early as the
classical Greeks, philosophers have contemplated the possibility of
other worlds. In the 17th century, writers began entertaining ideas
about ``a plenitude of worlds.'' In recent decades, scientists had
said the laws of probability favored the existence of other
planetary systems.
</P>
<P>
   Because the sun is a common and ordinary star, scientists
reasoned, groups of planets probably formed around some other stars
like it. Because there are 200 billion stars in the Milky Way
alone, planetary systems are probably abundant, in many cases a
natural result of the process of star formation. Recent
observations by the Hubble Space Telescope of disks of dust around
many young stars, which appeared to be an early stage of planetary
formation, supported this line of reasoning, astronomers said.
</P>
<P>
   The first breakthrough, in 1992, was both encouraging and
disappointing. Radio astronomers detected two or three planets
orbiting a stellar object, but it was not a normal star. It was a
pulsar, the spinning relic of an exploded star.
</P>
<P>
   Though the discovery gave astronomers hope, as the first
evidence of planets beyond the solar system, this was nothing like
the solar system, nothing to encourage speculation about
extraterrestrial life. No one could conceive of the conditions for
life, if they existed, surviving the cataclysm of a stellar
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The first detection of a planet around a normal shining star, 51
Pegasi, was made in 1995 by Dr. Michel Mayor of the Geneva
Observatory in Switzerland, and was soon confirmed by Marcy.
</P>
<P>
   This and subsequent solitary planet discoveries prepared
astronomers for the possibility that the first multiple-planet
system they observed would differ considerably from the solar
system. Most of the planets discovered were larger than Jupiter.
The ones traveling circular orbits, like solar planets, hugged
close to the searing heat of the star, closer than Mercury comes to
the sun. The others follow eccentric, oval-shaped orbits, unlike
solar planets, but they remain at distances from their stars
corresponding roughly to those of Venus and Earth from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has become even more complex for theorists now that
they have encountered three such huge planets in one system, one
planet in a close circular orbit and two in elliptical orbits. It
had been generally assumed that such large bodies, presumably gas
spheres like Jupiter, could have coalesced only in the cold regions
far from their star.
</P>
<P>
   In an article prepared for publication later this year, Marcy,
Mayor and Dr. William Cochran of the University of Texas at Austin
wrote, ``This `pile-up' of planets near stars suggests that inward
orbital migration occurred after formation,'' probably through
gravitational interactions with other planets that, in reaction,
were nudged outward into distant orbits where they are not yet
detectable.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomers also concluded that the eccentric orbits ``arise
from gravitational interactions with other planets, stars, or the
protoplanetary disk'' in their early history.
</P>
<P>
   In the nascent field of comparative planetary systems, the new
discovery has already given scientists a few insights. They are
more certain than ever that planetary systems are ubiquitous. They
think they are observing what is probably close to the upper mass
limitations for planets. And they feel sure that what they are
detecting are, indeed, planets.
</P>
<P>
   A few scientists had argued that many of the discoveries over
the last four years might not be planets but some new class of
astronomical bodies or possibly substellar objects known as brown
dwarfs. These are stars that failed to attain sufficient mass to
ignite the thermonuclear fusion that makes stars shine. Dr. Robert
Noyes of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in
Cambridge, Mass., leader of the other team that independently made
the new discovery, said the configuration of the three Upsilon
Andromedae objects should quiet those critics.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers said they could not rule out a habitable planet or
moon in the Upsilon Andromedae system. But the unsettling
gravitational forces from such large planets in close proximity
could have cleared the neighborhood of smaller bodies.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Earth-size bodies will probably fall below the
detection limits of today's telescopes for many years. Astronomers
will probably find several more systems similar to Upsilon
Andromedae's before they find something with some of the familiar
hallmarks of the solar system. The next major milestone, they said,
would be finding a planet about the size of Jupiter at about the
same distance from another star as Jupiter is from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, the Hubble Space Telescope will try to
examine nearby stars for the slightest flickering change in their
light. These could reveal the transit of a Jupiter-size planet at
Jupiter distances across the face of the star. The French space
mission Corot, to be launched in 2001, will in this way monitor the
light of 25,000 stars in search of extra-solar planets.
</P>
<P>
   The American Space Interferometry Mission, planned for launching
in 2005, will use an array of telescopes to look for smaller
extra-solar planets, possibly as small as Saturn or Neptune. It
will probably be less than 10 years before the Terrestrial Planet
Finder begins looking for Earthlike planets, and 20 before the Life
Finder spacecraft begins its work. That could usher in another new
field of science, comparative planetary biology.

<P>
   A new procedure for testing the lymph nodes of women with
early-stage breast cancer is so promising and is gaining in
popularity so rapidly that leaders in the field are concerned that
some surgeons may try it without being properly trained. And any
errors that result can be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure, sentinel-node biopsy, has been developed to
determine whether the cancer has spread to a few lymph nodes under
the arm near the breast.
</P>
<P>
   These few, called sentinel nodes, are the first ones to which a
tumor will drain and have been found to be accurate in gauging
whether cancer has spread to the entire lymph-node system of some
20 to 30 nodes.
</P>
<P>
   If the sentinel nodes are free of cancer, the disease has not
spread to the rest and no more nodes are removed. If a sentinel
node is cancerous, however, more nodes must be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, surgery to remove the entire system of pea-size lymph nodes
remains the standard at most institutions.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 100,000 women a year undergo the operation and as a
result risk developing lymphedema, a debilitating and long-term
swelling of the arm. Use of the new procedure could avoid that risk
for 80,000 of them.
</P>
<P>
   The sentinel-node biopsy is attracting wide attention at medical
meetings among doctors interested in performing it. Dr. Peter I.
Pressman, a cancer surgeon and professor of surgical oncology at
Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, N.Y., said
patients should carefully question their own doctors to determine
what training they have had in the procedure and how many they have
done.
</P>
<P>
   His and other warnings come as a new study is being reported in
the current issue of Annals of Surgery by researchers at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York on their finding that two
types of material _ a blue dye and a radioactive isotope _ used in
combination with the sentinel-node procedure markedly improved its
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Patrick Borgen, chief of breast service at
Sloan-Kettering and one of the authors of the report, also
emphasized how important it was that the teams of surgeons and
radiologists who plan to do the procedure receive thorough
training.
</P>
<P>
   If the biopsy misses cancer in the sentinel nodes, the disease
can spread irreversibly, as several oncologists point out, and
result in the death of the patient.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure, as done at Sloan-Kettering, involves injecting
both the blue dye and the isotopes into breast tissue around the
tumor.
</P>
<P>
   A small incision is made in the arm minutes later. Surgeons and
radiologists then look for traces of the dye or radioactivity that
will be present if the cancer has spread, in fluid that travels to
the sentinel nodes.
</P>
<P>
   The team needs to be trained in, among other things, the use of
a gamma counter to recognize the radioactivity traces.
</P>
<P>
   The American College of Surgeons and other institutions are
giving courses for surgeons and radiologists on the biopsy, and it
is being introduced in medical schools. Edward M. Copeland III,
chairman of the department of surgery at the University of Florida
Shands Hospital at Gainesville, said that doctors needed training
not only in nuclear medicine, but they also needed detailed
instruction and close supervision on detecting the blue dye.
</P>
<P>
   The sentinel-node biopsy was developed in research reported in
1997 by Dr. Armando E. Giuliano of the John Wayne Center Institute
in Santa Monica, Calif., who initially used the blue dye. The basic
procedure, Borgen said, holds the promise, if long-term results
hold up, of being the most important advance in breast surgery
since the development of breast reconstruction as a replacement for
a mastectomy.

CELEBRATING SECRETARIES' CELLULOID LEGACY  
 (FOR RELEASE WEDNESDAY, APRIL 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUE ADOLPHSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ April 19-23 is Professional Secretaries Week, a
good idea that probably should be retitled and filed under A for
administrative assistant.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever you call them, secretaries are the unsung heroes of
the office world, professionals who do indispensable work, often
know more about the business than the boss and yet rarely get the
respect they deserve _ especially from Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early days of filmmaking, there have been movies
featuring secretaries as central characters. In the 1930s and '40s,
most of the plots were near carbon copies, involving a secretary
whose primary goal was to type a ``Mrs.'' in front of her name.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things those early films did was reinforce the
stereotype that all secretaries were women,'' says Virginia
Solomon, a film buff who is also president of San Francisco's
Golden Gate Chapter of the International Association of
Administrative Professionals (formerly Professional Secretaries
International).
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, in the early part of the century, a lot were men,''
Solomon says. ``It wasn't until the movies came along that the
stereotype came out. Make the secretary a woman and, not only that,
a beautiful one. So the secretary became a sex object.''
</P>
<P>
   In later films, getting the job done (``Paris When It Sizzles'')
or getting ahead (``Working Girl'') became the more important
focus. But there was still romance involved _ it is Hollywood,
after all _ and the image still wasn't quite right.
</P>
<P>
   ``In `Working Girl,' for example, they showed being a secretary
as being blue collar,'' Solomon says. ``I won't say I was offended,
but it was sort of a turnoff to me. They had (Melanie Griffith) in
garish makeup and clothes _ another stereotype. Most secretaries I
know don't dress like that. They don't get hired if they look like
they just walked in from the mall.''
</P>
<P>
   While Solomon can enjoy most of these films for what they are _
entertainment _ she is partial to films that show secretaries
actually doing the work, not just going after the guy, such as in
``9 to 5.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was a pretty good one,'' she says. ``It was done
for comedy and there were lots of stereotypes, but the Lily Tomlin
character was right on the money. She was hardworking and
underappreciated. Lily is the best (depiction of a secretary) _
running the office from the sidelines, but (set ital) running (end
ital) the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Following is a selection of movies about secretaries, listed by
release date, that are available on video. You may have to do a
little digging to find the older ones, but they're out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Business Girl'' (1931) _ A very young Loretta Young plays
Claire ``Mac'' MacIntyre, who goes to work for an amorous ad man
(Ricardo Cortez) to earn money while her true love Johnny (Frank
Albertson) tries to make it as a musician in Europe. Interested
more in her legs than her typing skills, the boss helps her move up
in the company while pursuing her romantically. Misunderstandings
abound when Johnny returns. There's plenty of sexist dialogue, but
also some sexy scenes between Young and Albertson in this film,
which came out before the Hays Code imposed decency regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red-Headed Woman'' (1932) _ You know she's trouble from the
opening scene in a dress shop when Jean Harlow asks a sales clerk,
``Can you see through this?'' The clerk says yes, and Harlow
replies, ``I'll wear it.'' In this Anita Loos story, Harlow is a
ruthless secretary who will stop at nothing to climb the social
ladder, including getting her boss (Chester Morris) to divorce his
loving wife and marry her, then cheating on him with men who might
improve her status further. Another pre-Code film with some lusty
dialogue and skin shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wife vs. Secretary'' (1936) _ This one's worth it just for the
stars. Clark Gable is magazine editor Van Stanhope, who is happily
married to Linda (Myna Loy) and happy with his super-efficient
secretary Whitey (Harlow again, as the polar opposite of her
``Red-Headed Woman'' character). Linda isn't at all jealous of the
beautiful Whitey, and has no reason to be, until the power of her
mother-in-law's suggestion overtakes her. Look for newcomer James
Stewart as Harlow's boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (MORE) &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  ``Paris _ When It Sizzles'' (1964) _ William Holden is
Richard Benson, a procrastinating writer with a fondness for drink,
a script assignment and a fast-approaching deadline, who hires
secretary Gabrielle Simpson (Audrey Hepburn) to get it all down on
paper in his Paris apartment. As the plot unfolds, backtracks,
twists one way and then veers in another, Holden takes Hepburn on a
frantic ride through the City of Light for inspiration, falling for
her along the way. This comedy didn't get raves, and it probably
won't have you laughing out loud, but fans of Holden and the
always-lovely Hepburn will find it pleasant entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``9 to 5'' (1980) _ Secretaries Doralee (Dolly Parton), Violet
(Lily Tomlin) and Judy (Jane Fonda) all work for the despicable and
heartless Franklin Hart (a deliciously wicked Dabney Coleman).
Bonding in their suffering, the women share a marijuana cigarette
and describe their fantasies about doing in the boss _ a scene in
itself worth the price of a rental. When an opportunity for real
revenge presents itself, the three trio &LR;   &LR; literally hold Hart
prisoner in order to improve conditions at the office. Good therapy
for oppressed office workers everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Working Girl'' (1988) _ In this Mike Nichols comedy, Melanie
Griffith plays Tess McGill, a smart young woman from the wrong side
of the tracks with too much hair and an extensive lingerie
collection. She gets a secretarial job at a high-profile Wall
Street firm and does her best to learn from her hard-edged boss
Catherine (Sigourney Weaver). But when Catherine is laid up out of
town after a skiing accident, and Tess finds out her boss has been
stealing her ideas, she hatches a scheme to close a big deal on her
own, passing herself off as an executive at the firm and even
completing a successful merger with Catherine's boyfriend Jack
(Harrison Ford) in the process.

<P>
   &UR; THE ARCHIVIST &LR;  By Martha Cooley. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $13. A
widowed archivist at a university library becomes friends with an
intense graduate student whose questions force him to confront the
painful memory of his wife and her suicidal obsession with the
Holocaust. In 1998 the reviewer Brian Morton called this ``a
thoughtful and well-written first novel, suffused with intellectual
and moral integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL: THE FATES OF HUMAN SOCIETIES &LR;  By Jared
Diamond. Norton, $14.95. Why did Europeans and Asians always
succeed in their conquests of other civilizations, instead of the
other way around? A physiology professor, delving into many
disciplines to answer that provocative question, chalks it up less
to technological or political superiority than to an accidental
head start in agriculture and the devastating export of Old World
diseases. In 1997 in The New York Times Book Review, James Shreeve
called this Pulitzer Prize-winning history ``an ambitious, highly
important book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SEEING LIKE A STATE: HOW CERTAIN SCHEMES TO IMPROVE THE HUMAN
CONDITION HAVE FAILED &LR;  By James C. Scott. Yale University, $15.95.
This book seeks to explain why so many grandiose experiments in
social engineering in the 20th century _ from Mao's Great Leap
Forward to the construction of Brasilia _ have ended up as
disasters. The result is ``one of the most profound and
illuminating studies of this century ... in recent decades,'' John
Gray wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JACK MAGGS &LR;  By Peter Carey. Vintage International, $13. In this
crafty novel about a convict who illegally returns from Australia
to 19th-century London, the characters are shadows of real and
imaginary people in the life and work of Dickens. ``Carey creates a
rousing old-fashioned narrative, and brings to it a distinctly
modern, unromantic sensibility,'' Caryn James wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HENRY MITCHELL ON GARDENING &LR;  Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13. The
author, whose celebrated gardening columns appeared in The
Washington Post for more than 20 years until his death in 1993,
never strayed far from his small backyard garden in Washington. In
this collection, ``he alludes to this garden in a remarkable
variety of tones,'' Verlyn Klinkenborg wrote in 1998. ``It's always
tempting to quote Mitchell, but once you start it's hard to know
where to stop. He is the gardener for all of us who know better but
do worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued Mitchell's two earlier
collections of newspaper essays. Reviewing  &UR; ONE MAN'S GARDEN &LR;  ($14)
in The New York Times Book Review in 1992, Anne Raver said: ``Every
page is filled with his irascible, wholly unpretentious voice. ...
Mitchell never tries to be funny or erudite. He just is.''  &UR; THE
ESSENTIAL EARTHMAN &LR;  ($14) ``may be the most soul-satisfying
gardening book in years,'' Neal Johnston wrote in 1982. ``One
gathers that the garden Mitchell has worked on for years is a
rather wild, jungly affair with a startling variety of arresting
and much worked-over specimens turning up in odd places. ... His
book is much the same.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEAR MR. JEFFERSON: LETTERS FROM A NANTUCKET GARDENER &LR;  By Laura
Simon. Delta, $11.95. A novelist employs a series of letters to
Thomas Jefferson (an enthusiastic vegetable gardener) to explore
American garden history while writing about her own patch. The
result is ``an avid testament by a confirmed yet highly
knowledgeable amateur,'' Michael Pollan wrote last year. ``The
historical passages are swift, sure-footed and fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I KNOW THIS MUCH IS TRUE &LR;  By Wally Lamb. Regan Books/Harper
Perennial, $16. Everyone is bereft in this novel, especially the
protagonist, who despite the loss of his mother, wife, baby
daughter and career must somehow rouse himself to care for his
schizophrenic twin brother. ```I Know This Much Is True' ... never
grapples with anything less than life's biggest questions,'' Karen
Karbo wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE PRIEST FAINTED &LR;  By Catherine Temma Davidson. John
Macrae/Owl/Holt, $13. In this first novel, a young American travels
to Greece to investigate her heritage, linking her adventures to
those of the denizens of Mount Olympus. ``Davidson has created an
admirable, appealing heroine, a kind of female Odysseus who must
survive the dangers and beauties of a foreign place that happens to
be her ancestral homeland,'' Lisa Shea wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AMAZING GRACE: A VOCABULARY OF FAITH &LR;  By Kathleen Norris.
Riverhead, $12.95. Returning to the Christian church after 20
years, the author seeks to give weight and meaning to the ``scary''
words and phrases that once clouded her faith. ``She is an ideal
escort along the semantically bumpy road to her conversion,''
Michael Milburn wrote in 1998. The book's ``strength lies in its
depiction of a fallible woman engaged in spiritual inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROCK 'N' ROLL BABES FROM OUTER SPACE &LR;  By Linda Jaivin.
Broadway, $13. What happens when three green-skinned female aliens
set down their spaceship in Sydney, Australia, and take up with a
slacker in pursuit of good times and a rock career? ``There's
plenty of gender bending, drug gobbling and rude high jinks when
the Babes and their human comrade do the town,'' Sally Eckhoff
wrote in 1998. ``Jaivin's Tom Robbinsish sex writing gives the
story ... gratifyingly sweaty palms.''

WHITNEY BIENNIAL INVITES OUTSIDE CURATORS _ AND CRITICISM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the nation's most infamous high-profle exhibition of
contemporary art presented regularly.
</P>
<P>
   And, even though the next Whitney Biennial doesn't open until
2000, it's already a hot topic. That's because the artists for the
2000 Whitney Biennial Exhibition will be chosen by six curators
from outside New York City _ including Michael Auping, chief
curator for the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented decision to go with a committee of outsiders
breaks the single thread _ a staff curator _ that has connected the
museum's survey shows since they were inaugurated by Gertrude
Vanderbilt Whitney in 1932. Whitney had founded the institution as
a venue for contemporary American art, and its surveys long have
provided a refreshing counterpoint to its other, more narrowly
focused exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney Director Maxwell Anderson's idea to choose outside
curators has generated hopeful anticipation among regional artists
_ and perhaps a certain amount of anxiety in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   New York Times art critic Roberta Smith no doubt expressed the
sentiments of many Manhattanites, who consider the Whitney their
hometown museum, when she recently fretted: ``Is it really a
Whitney Biennial if it is farmed out?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Maybe not. One thing is certain: The names may belong to
out-of-towners, but the show will be consistent with recent
Biennials. It will feature piles of surburban detritus and a
selection of easel paintings, video installations and drawings, big
bombastic photographs, and at least one work suspended from the
ceiling. Some of the art will be about art, some about
self-expression and some about contemporary cultural issues.
</P>
<P>
   That's because artists from the hinterlands are so well-tuned to
New York-centric trends that ``regionalism'' becomes a moot point.
Nor are members of the curatorial team walking around with straw
between their teeth. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   _Auping is a well-traveled veteran on the contemporary-art
scene. His curatorial projects range from ``Tatsuo Miyajima: Big
Time'' to ``Clyfford Still,'' and to serving as curator of the
American Pavilion of the 1990 Venice Biennale.
</P>
<P>
   _Valerie Cassel, director of the Visiting Artists Program for
the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, has demonstrated her
awareness of contemporary topics through exhibitions and symposiums
on black sexuality, lesbian identity and art activism.
</P>
<P>
   _Hugh Davies, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in San
Diego, has organized exhibitions that include ``Francis Bacon: The
Papal Portraits of 1953'' and ``Blurring the Boundaries: 25 Years
of Installation Art.''
</P>
<P>
   _Jane Farver is director-designate of the List Visual Arts
Center at MIT. She has held posts at two important New York
exhibition spaces and curated such exhibitions as ``Adrian Piper:
Reflections'' and ``Out of India: Contemporary Art of the South
Asian Diaspora.''
</P>
<P>
   _Independent curator Andrea Miller-Keller is former curator of
contemporary art at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Conn. She
has organized shows for Daniel Buren, Sherrie Levine, Lorna Simpson
and Richard Tuttle, among others. She also was the U.S.
commissioner for the 23rd Sao Paolo Bienal.
</P>
<P>
   _Larry Rinder is director of the CCAC Institute at the
California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland and San Francisco.
He served as adviser to the 1991 and 1993 Whitney Biennials.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the fact we all reside in different parts of the country
can't help but affect ``who'' will be in the Biennial,'' says
Auping, who met with his colleagues for the first time in early
April.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be looking at aesthetics, but also at content, at what
is most pertinent to this moment in time,'' Auping adds.
</P>
<P>
   Curators aren't confined to representing their respective
regions, Rinder says. And _ even if 2000 goes down as the Year of
the Faux Biennial _ participating artists likely won't care:
They'll still receive once-in-a-lifetime exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Biennials attract thousands of art-wise visitors and much press
analysis. Exposure may lead to New York representation or national
recognition. Being in a Biennial boosts an artist's reputation back
home _ which can lead to more regional shows and sales. At the very
least, the artist gains a psychological edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a validation,'' says Talley Dunn, director of Gerald
Peters Gallery in Dallas, who represents several Biennial alumni.
``It makes you part of a national conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the nation's only survey of contemporary art _ there's
the Corcoran Biennial, the Carnegie International and Site Santa Fe
_ but ``nothing like it creates a similar buzz,'' Dunn says.
``Normally, nobody but artists and other curators question who gets
included in an exhibition. But, with the Whitney, everyone
questions the whole thing. It makes you think.''
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney's surveys haven't always been so notorious, however.
The museum reached out to a popular audience under Thomas
Armstrong, director from 1974 to 1990. Then, under David Ross'
tenure (from 1991 to '98), the Whitney apparently turned to baiting
the bourgeoisie: Ross oversaw thematic shows investigating sexual
identity, suburban corruption, racism and social class.
</P>
<P>
   For that, and because New York remains the nation's art capital,
the Whitney receives attention organizers of other art surveys only
dream of, Corcoran Biennial curator Terri Sultan says. Presented by
the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., that survey was
inaugurated in 1907 and focuses exclusively on painting.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, the Whitney Biennial's reputation
often overshadows its substance, Sultan says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound like a Pollyanna, but I think museum
curators are responsible people who try to bridge the gap between
artists and the people out there in the world,'' Sultan says. ``And
if a biennial is a way to get people into the museum to have a
conversation about art _ and possibly even have a life-changing
experience _ it has value even if the show is a failure.''

<P>
   Experts who study the effects of synthetic anabolic steroids are
encouraged, for two distinctly different reasons, that two new
trials of their use show a benefit for two groups of very sick
people. One reason is the possible long-term benefits for the
patients. But the other is that the trials may serve as a reminder
of whom the drugs were not intended for: healthy people who use
them in ways that can destroy their health.
</P>
<P>
   The trials, reported last week, found that taking anabolic
steroids helped kidney dialysis patients and people with HIV regain
some of the weight they had been losing uncontrollably as a result
of their illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Wadler, an anabolic-steroid authority at New York
University Medical Center, points out that the first widespread use
of the drug came after World War II for people who were wasting
away from illnesses or injuries suffered in the war or in
concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   It was for these people, the very sick, that steroids were
developed, he said, not for healthy athletes seeking to build
bigger muscles to improve their athletic performance. The latter
include baseball's new home-run king, Mark McGwire, who says he
regularly takes androstenedione, a precursor steroid that quickly
becomes anabolic once taken into the body. Professional baseball,
unlike other sports, has not banned this substance. Medical experts
say athletes frequently take anabolic steroids in doses high enough
to have dangerous consequences, with some users known to have taken
10 to 100 times the recommended dosage.
</P>
<P>
   These steroids are synthesized from human testosterone, the
hormone responsible for male characteristics like increased muscle
tissue, facial hair and a deep voice. Testosterone's effect as a
muscle builder was discovered more than 100 years ago by the French
physician Charles-Edouard Brown-Sequard, who in 1889 injected
animal extracts into a dog and then into himself. At the time, he
hypothesized that added testosterone would be good for human
health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown-Sequard overinterpreted what was happening, but he
turned out to be onto something, as history has shown,'' Wadler
said. The synthetic forms of testosterone were designed to replace
the body's normal supply of the hormone, which can be depleted by
disease, and to help the patient regain strength, Wadler said in
``Drugs and the Athlete'' (Oxford Press), regarded as the
definitive textbook on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Goldberg, a consulting physician for the U.S. Olympic
Committee, expressed similar concern about the expanding use of
steroids, especially among teen-agers. Adolescent females are now
the fastest growing group of users. With a colleague, Dr. Diane
Elliot, Goldberg recently completed a program for 3,200 athletes in
31 high schools in Oregon and Washington among whom steroid use was
reduced by a reported 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the clinical trials of anabolic steroids for kidney-dialysis
and HIV patients, low doses were used to reverse previously
uncontrollable weight loss, which has been associated with sharply
reduced life spans among these groups. The patients, in the two
separate studies reported last week in The Journal of the American
Medical Association, were given the steroids in conjunction with
exercise programs.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups of patients increased muscle mass significantly more
than a group given a placebo, and increased their abilities to do
more exercise faster while becoming less fatigued. More studies are
needed to determine how much and for how long steroids can be
safely used, the doctors who directed the studies said. But they
pointed out that the doses used by the athletes were much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing medical uses against the uses to enhance athletic
performance, those who take steroids must ask: What is a safe dose
and when does a dose become dangerous? The second question is being
urgently studied at a number of major institutions.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Wadler said, all science really knows on the
subject is this: It has been found safe to increase the amount of
testosterone or testosterone substitute to the normal level among
sick people whose supply has become depleted. But at some level
above this, the substitutes can have disastrous results.
</P>
<P>
   The list of problems doctors cite is very long: liver tumors,
uncontrollably violent behavior, elevated cholesterol, enlarged
veins in the liver that cause fatal bleeding, permanent stunting of
growth in adolescents, and blood clotting that leads to premature
stroke and heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The list of less serious but nevertheless undesirable effects is
also long and includes large breasts in men and beards in women.

   The tiny shrimplike crustaceans known as copepods are the
nitro-burning dragsters of the planktonic world. They are only
about an eighth of an inch long, but some varieties can go from
zero to 200 (body lengths per second, that is) in the space of a
few milliseconds when confronted with danger.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the University of Hawaii at Manoa have
suggested one reason why some of these creatures, which constitute
one of the major sources of protein in the ocean, exhibit such
speed. Borrowing a trick from the vertebrates, some copepods have
myelin-like sheaths on their nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   Myelin acts much like the insulation on a piece of wire,
enabling electrical impulses to travel faster along nerve cells.
Such speed improvement is thought to be especially valuable in
large vertebrates, where nerve impulses must travel over long
distances.

<P>
   But myelin and similar substances are being found in an
increasing number of invertebrates where, because of their small
size, speed would not necessarily be considered crucial.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaiian researchers, reporting in the journal Nature, found
myelin-like sheaths in 11 species of copepods. And they found that
those with the sheaths responded significantly faster to stimuli
than those without the sheaths. &QL;

   One fear about genetic engineering of crops is that in the
field, the designer genes _ and the traits, like herbicide
resistance, that they foster _ could be transferred by way of
pollen to wild cousins of the crop plants. This could create
``superweeds'' that could harm agriculture and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The concern has been so great, in fact, that a new way of
engineering crops has been developed, one in which the foreign
genes are inserted into DNA in the chloroplasts, energy-producing
structures in the plant cell, rather than in the traditional site,
the nucleus. While genes in the nucleus are transmitted through
pollen, chloroplast genes are not. Or at least that was thought to
be the case.
</P>
<P>
   Now a three-year study by botanists at the University of Reading
in England shows that chloroplast genetic engineering does appear
to be safer, at least for one crop.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, who wrote about their work in the journal Nature
Biotechnology, studied the rapeseed plant, the source of canola
oil, and a relative, the wild turnip. They found little evidence of
genes from the chloroplasts being transferred between the two
plants.
</P>
<P>
   They also looked at what happened when seeds of the rapeseed
were spilled into a field of wild turnip. Rather than being hardy
and virulent, the hybrid plants that resulted died off, for reasons
not yet known. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

<P>
   Astronomers have expanded their horizons once again, reporting a
new record for the most distant object ever observed.
</P>
<P>
   The object is a galaxy, reported by three researchers from the
State University of New York at Stony Brook using the Hubble Space
Telescope, that probably has a red shift _ a measurement of how far
the object is receding _ of 6.68. This means that light from the
galaxy reaching the earth began its journey when the universe was
just 5 percent of its current age. Assuming the universe is 13
billion years old, the light originated less than 700 million years
after the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   The measurement, which must be confirmed through additional
observations, might be considered a great leap from the previous
record holder, also a galaxy, which has a red shift of 5.64. But at
such high red shifts, a large jump does not mean a correspondingly
large increase in age. The light from the previous record-holder
originated when the universe was just 6 percent of its current age.
</P>
<P>
   The true significance of the new finding may be what it shows
about astronomers' increasing abilities to study the earliest
objects in the universe and how they have evolved.

PATAKIS PAY $70,000 IN TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES M. ODATO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki's family earnings slid in
1998, but he's getting a boost from his wife's marketing work with
businesses run by family friends.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth ``Libby'' Pataki earns $80,000 per year as a part-time
employee of Ron Lauder, of the Estee Lauder cosmetic fortune, and
she has a new part-time consulting job, according to income tax
documents made public by New York's first couple.
</P>
<P>
   The documents showed the Patakis earned $246,417 in gross income
in 1998, $95,000 from Libby Pataki's two marketing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady received $15,000 for a job she started in
November as a consultant for Premier Heart, a Portland, Ore.,
start-up developing a heart disease diagnostic service.
</P>
<P>
   Her job is to write and deliver speeches in a campaign to alert
people to the risks of heart disease, her new employer, an old
family pal, said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hayden, the chief executive of Premier Heart, said he
thought Libby Pataki is worth $7,500 per month because ``she's very
good.'' Hayden graduated in 1967 from Yale University with the
governor and attended Columbia University Law school with Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   He said Pataki's daughter is his daughter's roommate now at
Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Libby Pataki, he said, will be ``developing a campaign to raise
the awareness of women of the dangers of heart disease. It's a
campaign of speeches to women's groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Premier, a six-month-old company with eight employees, is based
in Portland. But it has a presence in New York state and in Ocean
Ridge, Fla., Hayden said.
</P>
<P>
   The company will be marketing a diagnostic service that
physicians will use on patients. ``We will be selling the test, the
service ... $400 per test,'' Hayden said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not committing herself full-time to us,'' Hayden said.
</P>
<P>
   If she maintains her job as a marketing consultant to companies
operated by Ron Lauder, for which she received $80,000 over 12
months of last year, and keeps working at the current rate with
Premier Heart, as Hayden expects she will, Libby Pataki will make
almost as much as the governor's new salary of $179,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki tax forms, released Friday, showed that the family
returns indicated real estate losses last year of almost $61,000,
mostly from buying high and selling low on his Saratoga Lake
condominium. Pataki also reported a loss of almost $8,700 from a
farm he owns in Washington County.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor, who collected his $130,290 state salary
plus $74,460 in speaking and book sales receipts, and his wife had
$246,417 in gross earnings last year.
</P>
<P>
   The total income fell from $337,455 in 1997 and $267,483 in
1996, largely because Pataki cut back on speaking appearances and
didn't have the capital gains from real estate sales.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who live in Garrison, N.Y., paid taxes of $69,805,
or 30.5 percent, on adjusted gross income of $228,417.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki's overpaid their taxes by $9,766 to the Internal
Revenue Service and $6,003 to the state.

   First-term Democratic Attorney General Eliot Spitzer reported
that he and his wife, Silda Wall, accumulated $472,784 in earnings
last year, most of which came from Spitzer's work with his father,
real estate magnate Bernard Spitzer. The attorney general also took
in $171,973 in profits from renting his 200 Central Park South
building.
</P>
<P>
   Their tax burden, at $199,388, represents 42 percent of their
taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   The tax payments include $140,289 to the IRS. The couple had to
write a $60,489 check for underpaying taxes, including the $2,292
penalty for underpaying.
</P>
<P>
   State taxes amounted to $50,299. Again, the couple underpaid and
had to send $13,270 more, including penalties, to New York's tax
agency.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general reported a $730,508 sale of his share of a
limited investment partnership, Cramer Partners LP, to help him pay
for his 1998 campaign against Republican Dennis Vacco.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Comptroller H. Carl McCall and his wife, Fashion
Institute of Technology President Joyce Brown, reported a combined
1998 income of $365,652, a McCall spokesman said. The couple paid
$122,703 in income taxes and gave $6,475 to charity.

BREACHING DAMS MAY HELP SALMON BUT ENDANGER FARMERS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHTUCNA, Wash. _ Shuttered businesses haunt this Eastern
Washington town.
</P>
<P>
   Paint peels from silent storefronts. Plywood replaces glass in a
door that never opens. A restaurant and gas station are dark.
Remaining businesses, says local farmer Ben Nunamaker, ``are
hanging on by their teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Decades of declining farm income have almost sucked Washtucna
dry. This year, with wheat prices at a near 30-year low, some
farmers talk openly of quitting. So, when government agents came
here recently to discuss breaching four Snake River dams to help
save disappearing salmon runs, the response was bitter and angry.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the dams ``is about one of the most foolish things I've
ever heard anybody think of,'' said Lester Snyder, who has farmed
here for a half-century. ``The devastation would be just
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in the wheat fields of the Palouse farm region, emotions on
the Snake River dams run hotter than the August sun. The Snake is
not just a river here; it's a superhighway to world markets. Barges
shuttle grain downriver at less than half the rates railroads
charge. Columbia and Snake river barges carry almost two-thirds of
Washington's grain, and drain crops to world markets from as far
off as Montana and the Dakotas.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminate dams and barges, farmers here say, and higher shipping
costs would slash land values, bankrupt farms and turn main streets
to ghost towns. Though these forecasts may be exaggerated, experts
confirm that if the dams were retired tomorrow, the heaviest
burdens would fall here, on farmers already down on their luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the late '80s, we lost the railroad through our town,''
said Dan Blankenship, who runs one of the largest wheat farms near
Washtucna, a town about 200 miles southeast of Seattle. ``If we
lose the dams, we're toast.''
</P>
<P>
   Asking Eastern Washington farmers to give up the Snake River
dams is like urging a dying man to give blood, says Ken Casavant, a
Washington State University economist. ``Everything has been going
wrong for these folks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes have risen this year because the once unthinkable act
of dam-breaching has become thinkable. Most scientists now say that
breaching the dams _ by cutting a path around the concrete
structures through the earthen mounds at their flanks _ offers the
best chance to restore endangered and threatened fish runs.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile salmon making their way to the ocean are most at risk
to damage from the dams. Shunted through or over the dams on their
migration to the sea, they can scrape against screens or pipes, get
hammered by water pressure changes, or be exposed to lethal levels
of nitrogen gas in water below the dams. Slower downstream movement
through slack reservoirs also exposes them to hotter water and more
predators, and may affect their ability to adapt to salt water.
Also, floods of hatchery-raised fish can compete with naturally
spawned salmon for food, or even prey on them.
</P>
<P>
   Most politicians don't support breaching the dams. U.S. Sen.
Slade Gorton, R-Wash., has been leading the opposition to
breaching. Gov. Gary Locke has said he ``can't imagine any argument
that would lead me to support'' retiring the dams.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the federal Endangered Species Act mandates protection of
the fish, so federal agencies are looking closely at dam-breaching.
The Army Corps of Engineers is studying its costs and benefits, and
the National Marine Fisheries Service is considering its biological
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   The costs would be monumental. Preliminary analyses suggest that
retiring the dams would force the region to replace about 5 percent
of its hydropower with alternatives that cost upward of $200
million more a year and also increase pollution. Dam removal and
loss of barge traffic would each cost another $50 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   The burden of higher power costs would be modest for most people
in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Other costs of dam-breaching would be relatively small and
scattered. Some marinas would be left dry, riverbanks might need to
be shored up and aluminum companies could face boosts in their huge
electricity bills.
</P>
<P>
   Benefits from added recreation in a free-flowing Snake River
might balance out such costs. One preliminary government study
leaked by environmental groups predicted $1billion in annual
recreation benefits, with some forecasts running as high as $5
billion. But officials in charge of the study said the numbers were
misunderstood and the analysis was incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   But these impacts pale beside the effects of dam-breaching on
those who farm the hundreds of thousands of acres of wheat north of
the Tri-Cities area of Washington state _ Kennewick, Pasco and
Richland. Growers would see shipping rates soar and the value of
their farms plummet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that breaching the dams could lead to a
lot of bankruptcies here,'' said Jim Baker, a Sierra Club
representative in Eastern Washington.
</P>
<P>
   To counter those losses, some environmental groups are calling
for a major federal investment in roads and railroads in the
region, or failing that, paying farmers outright for damages.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers' reliance on the dams serves as a reminder that the main
justification for their construction was shipping, rather than
hydropower or flood control. The dams make Lewiston, Idaho, a
seaport and offer cheap transportation from a scattering of grain
elevators that hug reservoirs from Lewiston to the Tri-Cities.
</P>
<P>
   Though grain farmers would be most directly affected by
dam-breaching, they aren't the only ones who would be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers of 35,000 acres of irrigated farmland near Pasco would
see their fruit trees and vegetables go dry when reservoirs dropped
below pumps in the Ice Harbor Dam reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   Several small ports would have to be abandoned, and major
economic losses would be felt at Lewiston and Clarkston. Perhaps
hardest hit would be Lewiston's dominant employer, Potlatch Corp.,
which sends paper, pulp and lumber downriver on barges.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Washtucna, about 22 road miles from the Windust river
port, farmers gathered in the local high school in January to
discuss what dam-breaching would do to them. Though polite and
respectful, they voiced gloom about the prospects for their
community even without dam-breaching.
</P>
<P>
   Asian economic woes last year drove wheat prices down to $3 a
bushel, perilously close to the break-even point for some farmers.
``On $3 wheat, we can't hardly make money anyway,'' said David
Baumann, a third-generation farmer. ``If it wasn't for us being
family businesses and working for nothing, we couldn't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Washtucna has shriveled since a brief boom in the 1960s, when it
swelled with homes and the paychecks of workers who built the dams.
The workers drifted off in the 1970s, and as farm income fell,
population and town vitality sagged.
</P>
<P>
   With breaching, a grinding struggle could become a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price of land would be cut in half,'' said Nunamaker, the
farmer. ``A lot of it would go back to rangeland.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeding off each other's discontent, farmers forecast doubling
or tripling of shipping costs and soaring accident rates as trucks
clog poorly maintained roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many salmon does it take to equal a child's life? I want
to see a graph on that,'' demanded one man.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary studies suggest farmers have reason for concern,
though the problems may be less severe than many believe. A
legislative study found that roads and railways in the area would
be overwhelmed by traffic if the barges disappeared. Upgrading them
so grain shipping costs remained stable might cost up to $300
million, it concluded. That kind of government largesse is
unlikely, and without it economists agree that grain shipping rates
would rise.
</P>
<P>
   Most affected by rate hikes would be farmers within 70 to 100
miles of the lower Snake River. They truck their grain to river
terminals and currently reap the advantage of barging's lower rates
and economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   If dam-breaching blocked barges from traveling above the
Tri-Cities, farmers would either have to truck grain or use the
railroads, and both are more expensive than barging. Loss of
competition might even encourage the railroads to boost rates even
more.
</P>
<P>
   And it could get worse. Federal agencies also are studying
drawdowns of the Columbia River's John Day Dam, the second dam
downstream from Pasco. Blankenship, the farmer, figures the Snake
River dams would be just the first to go. ``They're going to take
all the Columbia River dams out, too,'' he growls.
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers have predicted a boost in shipping costs of 30
cents to 50 cents per bushel of wheat.
</P>
<P>
   WSU's Casavant, the leading transportation expert in Eastern
Washington, expects an increase of about 9 cents per bushel, to a
total of about 58 cents for shipping. Farmers closest to the river,
who have had the lowest shipping costs, could see increases of up
to 22 cents per bushel, Casavant says.
</P>
<P>
   But the number rises if it includes the cost of upgrading roads
and railways. Dennis Wagner, who is overseeing a study of shipping
costs as far off as the Dakotas for the Army Corps of Engineers,
figures some shipping costs could rise as much as 35 cents per
bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the amount, it would come out of the farmer's wallet,
because wheat prices are set by world markets. And that could take
a big chunk out of currently meager earnings and push some farms
into red ink.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that American farming has paid a bitter price for
its high-tech productivity. Farmer John Crouse pays more than 10
times more for a combine now than when he started farming. But with
less than half the manpower his father fielded, he farms twice as
much acreage and produces about four times as much grain. Such
success, multiplied across the landscape, has fed the world but
starved farm incomes and payrolls by driving down world prices.
</P>
<P>
   Despite hard times, Washtucna residents still voice a fierce
pride in their farms and their way of life.
</P>
<P>
   The land here is some of the most productive in the world for
wheat production. Averaging 60 bushels per acre, Washington
production is double that of Kansas and North Dakota, the nation's
leading wheat growers.
</P>
<P>
   But economically, farms here are flirting with the bankruptcies
of the 1930s. For years, smaller family farms have been selling out
to bigger businesses with deeper pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Casavant, the WSU economist, agreed that if barging were cut off
tomorrow, land prices would fall, some marginal wheat-growing lands
would revert to rangeland, and more farms would be gobbled into
larger, more capital-intensive farms.
</P>
<P>
   One that might be swallowed is the Snyder place, which Lester
Snyder took over in 1948. With his wife, Marie, Lester raised a
son, Jerry, who today is the fourth generation in his family to
farm the land.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Snyder doesn't want to end the family tradition, but he
may be forced to, his father says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've farmed here all my life,'' Lester Snyder muses. ``Should
I put more money into farming, or should I get out and quit?''

FARMERS STAND TO SEE INVESTMENTS BULLDOZED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB TAYLOR  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASCO, Wash. _ In 1975, Ron Reimann and his brother-in-law sank
powerful pumps into the Snake River just above Ice Harbor Dam and
made the dry hills bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Today, apple and cherry orchards wrap the shoulders of the river
above T&AMP;R Farm's pumps. On flat fields beyond, neat furrows sprout
wheat, as well as potatoes, corn and other vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   However, the prospering farm is at risk, a hostage in the battle
over saving the Snake River salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time, federal agencies are seriously
considering breaching the four lower Snake River dams to help
threatened and endangered salmon. If the river runs free past the
dam, Reimann's pumps, orchards and crops would be left high and
dry.
</P>
<P>
   Lowering the pumps would be complicated and cost about $1.8
million, Reimann says, which is more than he can justify spending.
If the dams are retired, his irrigation might go with them.
</P>
<P>
   Battles over the Snake River dams have been raging for a decade.
Reimann, a bear of a man with brown hair and a mustache, is
tormented by the uncertainty of whether it will put him out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I say this isn't going to happen; the next I'm really
concerned,'' he says. ``If it were clearcut, it would be better.''
</P>
<P>
   T&AMP;R Farms is one of 13 farms that water about 35,000 acres of
orchards and crops from the Ice Harbor pool. If the reservoir
drops, some people assume the government would have to pay farmers
to lower their irrigation pumps. But so far, government studies
show it would be cheaper to pay farmers the difference between
dry-land farm and irrigated farm prices _ a total of $10 million a
year _ and bulldoze the fruit trees and cottonwoods into the sandy
soil.
</P>
<P>
   That would end a dream for Reimann, the son of a dry-land farmer
who built his farm here to escape reliance on fickle Eastern
Washington rain.
</P>
<P>
   At the river's edge, he proudly displays three 800-horsepower
electric pumps, supplemented by smaller pumps of 400 to 600
horsepower, that power his irrigation system.
</P>
<P>
   The pumps sprinkle 3,200 acres of the 4,200 acres that T&AMP;R has
developed, including 1,000 acres that it sold to Stemilt Management
Co., a fruit-growing company based in Wenatchee, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   This is no seat-of-the-pants operation. Reimann monitors
moisture and nutrients in his fields with the care of a chemist.
With a global positioning system hooked up to his tractor, he
sprays fertilizer only where it is needed. His big pivot irrigator
stops spraying when neutron probes show that moisture has seeped
below the root zone. No point in pumping into the aquifer, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Though farm prices have been lousy lately, the land ``generates
a lot more income than it did before,'' Reimann says.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his investment has yet to bear fruit. Reimann walks
through 6-foot-tall apple trees planted three years ago. ``All I
have in the apples is debt,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   There are easier ways to make a living. But Reimann would like
to see those apples grow and have his 29-year-old son take over the
farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really think it's neat when you plant a crop and it comes
up,'' Riemann says. ``I'd rather be out on the farm than in the
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Reimann's pumps lift water 400 feet up the north shoulder of the
Snake River. Although drawdown would drop the reservoir only 73
feet lower, moving the pumps would not be simple. The riverbank
would be waterlogged and unstable for as long as two years. With
employees and thirsty trees, he says, ``I can't wait two years.''
</P>
<P>
   He contends the government, having built the dam and approved
more than 50 permits for his irrigation system, has an obligation
to move his pumps if it lowers the river. ``If the Ice Harbor Dam
hadn't been here, the pumps would have been lower from the start,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the loss of water, he says, is like building a house only
to have the city say, ``You built it in the wrong site; you've got
to move it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of moving pumps or buying him out, he hopes the
government will leave the reservoir as is.
</P>
<P>
   Reimann concedes that steelhead fishing might be better if the
river were lower, but overall he sees little to be gained by
returning the Snake River to natural-river level.
</P>
<P>
   The existing pool supports barges, water-skiing and sailing.
Wildlife populations have exploded, too, with waterfowl using the
reservoir and pheasant, deer, geese and eagles multiplying on the
irrigated uplands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has shown me a source of power that is more
environmentally friendly than the dams,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As for claims that dam-breaching would restore fish runs, he
says, ``Nobody's sure that this thing is going to work.''

SCIENTISTS SLOWLY COME TO FAVOR DAM-BREACHING 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have reached a tentative consensus that dam-breaching
offers by far the best chance of restoring strong Snake River
salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   But like so much in the Columbia Basin salmon debate, this
conclusion is neither simple nor certain.
</P>
<P>
   Science, in short, offers policy-makers gamblers' odds, not
answers _ and the 20-year debate over Columbia Basin fish runs
grinds on.
</P>
<P>
   The broadest analysis to date comes from about two dozen
Northwest scientists, Indian tribes, federal agencies and other
groups. The scientists' effort, called the Program for Analysis and
Testing of Hypotheses (PATH), analyzed options for improving salmon
and steelhead survival in the lower Snake River.
</P>
<P>
   The team used sophisticated mathematical models and was reviewed
by four leading scientists from outside the region. Under every
modeled scenario, the virtual fish fared better without dams than
with them, even with extra efforts to barge or divert salmon past
the dams.
</P>
<P>
   With dams bypassed, the simulations showed spring and summer
chinook salmon runs recovering to healthy numbers in about a
half-century some 80 percent of the time, compared with half the
time with the dams in place. The healthy margin remained large even
if dams were made more fish-friendly by boosting water flows or
barging young fish.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups greeted the simulation results prepared by
the panel of independent scientists as decisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fairly clear that under virtually all assumptions, dam
removal is the only option that meets both the survival and
recovery goals,'' said Tim Stearns of Save Our Wild Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, in a broad review of the science, the National
Marine Fisheries Service cautioned that the apparent advantage of
breaching could evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   Under a small minority of the computer simulations,
dam-breaching appeared to afford ``negligible advantages,'' said
the review's director, Peter Kareiva. Moreover, he said, tentative
new findings hint the dam-breaching advantage may be overstated.
</P>
<P>
   The PATH report assumed that salmon that are barged through the
lower Snake River dams are considerably less likely to survive a
round-trip to the Pacific Ocean than non-barged fish.
</P>
<P>
   Initial returns from a new line of research tend to show that
barged fish actually may return almost as well as those that
migrate freely.
</P>
<P>
   If that tentative finding proves right, the mathematical
advantage of dam-breaching over other salmon improvements would
drop from 30 percent to a more modest 11 percent, the Fisheries
Service said. If barging doesn't weaken fish at all, the edge drops
to a negligible 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those caveats aside, the Marine Fisheries Service confirmed that
``breaching meets recovery and survival goals over the widest range
and highest proportion of assumptions'' for the spring-summer
chinook, the best-known and most numerous salmon the Snake River.
And it appears even more advantageous for fall chinook, though less
is known about that run.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said more study might answer questions about barging.
</P>
<P>
   But delay has risk, too.
</P>
<P>
   If dam operations remained unchanged for 24 years, scientists
calculated that the chance of fish runs going practically extinct
would rise about 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of Snake River salmon has been sharp since the lower
Snake River dams went up in the 1960s and 1970s. Spring and summer
chinook, which numbered about 1.5 million a century ago, have
fallen to less than 10,000 fish.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem generally isn't with returning adult salmon,
but with juveniles. As they pass the dams on their migration to the
sea, young salmon are bumped and scraped, injured by water pressure
fluctuations, and exposed to lethal levels of nitrogen gas in the
water below the dams. In reservoirs, they are exposed to water that
is too warm for them, and delays getting to sea may affect how they
survive in salt water.
</P>
<P>
   Dam defenders say these problems have been reduced and the
practice of collecting young salmon in the upper Snake River and
barging them below Bonneville Dam on the Washington-Oregon border
is an effective antidote.
</P>
<P>
   But decades of extensive barging of fish have failed to reverse
the salmon decline.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, 200 scientists signed a letter drafted by an Idaho
environmental group urging President Clinton to lower the Snake
River to natural-river level to save salmon and steelhead runs.
</P>
<P>
   They included two current members and one former member of an
influential group of scientists that advise the Northwest Power
Planning Council.
</P>
<P>
   The letter concluded:
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough time remains to restore them, but only if the failed
practices of the past are abandoned and we move quickly to restore
the normative river conditions under which these fish evolved.''
</P>
<P>
   But dam supporters _ and some scientists _ loudly disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Lovelin, director of the Columbia River Alliance, a
consortium of dam-dependent businesses, claimed that the PATH study
underemphasized evidence that dams and barging may not be as
harmful to fish as in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Lovelin dismissed many scientists as advocates for breaching.
And so do many audiences in Eastern Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When federal biologist Tom Cooney explained the panel's findings
in Pasco, Wash., in January, he was derided by his audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're using assumptions as facts, weighting the inputs the
way you want so the dams need to be removed,'' one elderly man
said.

WHAT DAM-BREACHING COULD COST FARMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB TAYLOR  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To understand the impact of shipping costs on a wheat farmer,
consider a typical 2,500-acre dry-land wheat farm operated by two
generations of the same family.
</P>
<P>
   Producing about 100,000 bushels of wheat a year, the farm could
sell its crop for about $290,000 at recent price levels. After
expenses, that nets about $80,000 for a year's work.
</P>
<P>
   That's not much for a farm worked by several people who have
invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in land and machinery.
But raise shipping costs, and the earnings start to evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   Boost rates by a dime per bushel, about the average boost
expected by some economists, and net earnings drop by $10,000. A
35-cent boost, in the range expected by some farmers, would drain
$35,000, or 44 percent of the farm's earnings. If expenses rise or
prices fall, the farm could easily fall into bankruptcy.

 &HT;    US AIRWAYS TOPS ANNUAL AIRLINE QUALITY RANKING

   WASHINGTON _ Delta Air Lines ranks fourth among the 10 major
airlines in quality, trailing US Airways, Continental Airlines and
American Airlines, according to the latest study by Wichita State
University and the University of Nebraska at Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   The annual Airline Quality Rating (cq), released Monday in
Washington,
</P>
<P>
   ranks the biggest carriers in four areas: on-time arrivals,
passenger bumping, mishandled baggage and customer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, airline quality declined in 1998, according to Dean E.
Headley, an associate professor of marketing at Wichita State
University and coauthor of the report.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's philosophy toward passengers, he said, seems to
be ``get them on the plane, take their money, and don't make them
too mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Headley noted that complaints per 100,000 passengers increased
more than 25 percent last year, following a 20 percent rise in
1997. ``I don't know why, but people don't seem to be happy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines' increase in customer complaints _ 23.4 percent
_ was slightly below that of the industry. Its ranking among
airlines in number of complaints per 100,000 passengers was
unchanged from 1997, at 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based carrier's on-time record improved, to 79.6
percent in 1998 from 74.1 percent a year earlier. The industry's
on-time performance declined, to 77.2 percent from 77.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines also improved in passenger bumpings per 10,000
boardings, which fell 14.4 percent, and in mishandled baggage per
1,000 (cq) passengers, down 5.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The overall 1998 rankings are not comparable to the prior year's
results because of changes in the criteria. Statistics used in the
rankings are from the Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The results of the latest report give ``reasonable cause for
Congress to pass the Airline Passenger Fair Treatment Initiative,
commonly called the Airline Passengers' Bill of Rights,'' the
authors concluded.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal would require that passengers be given more
information about flight delays and other problems, increase
airline liability for lost and damaged luggage, and raise the
penalties for passenger bumping.
</P>
<P>
   But if passengers' rights are spelled out, so should their
responsibilities, Headley said.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers can help make the system work better, he said, by:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cancelling reservations over the phone instead of just not
showing up for a flight.
</P>
<P>
   _ Checking unwieldy baggage instead of carrying it on board.
</P>
<P>
   _ Knowing their rights under current rules.
</P>
<P>

quality rating:

</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Magazines covering `Star Wars' in full force
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The next generation of ``Star Wars'' heroes wields
light sabers on the cover of Time ($3.50) heralding the opening of
``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace.'' The long-awaited
prequel opens May 19 on 2,500 screens, setting aflutter the hearts
of sci-fi film fans hoping for thrills to equal those from 1977,
and warming the bottom lines of studio executives yearning for a
``Titanic''-sized blockbuster. Along with the usual slice of hype,
Time presents a gatefold guide to the new movie's cast of
characters (including such digitally generated ``actors'' as the
lizardish Jar Jar Binks), plus, strangely enough, a conversation
between PBS savant Bill Moyers and ``Star Wars'' creator George
Lucas on the spiritual side of Lucas' spacy world. Time is printing
75,000 additional copies for an expected boom in newsstand sales,
said Todd Polkes, Time's manager of public affairs. About a
purported battle for an ``exclusive'' on the film coverage,
Newsweek's ($3.50) Roy Brunett points out that his magazine put the
new movie on the cover of its Asian editions in March, and that
numerous other magazines have given the film a front page ride,
including the current Wired. Of Lucasfilms, he notes drily, ``They
are getting their story out.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The e-truth will out: Dear Computer User: If you're one of 96
million Americans using e-mail, and you're not worried about what
happens to the flaming messages you've sent to friends and foes,
it's time to worry. We learn in Wired ($6.95) (which also features
coverboy Lucas) that e-mail lives forever, and that the ``delete''
key is no protection. Incriminating e-mail has played a significant
role in the anti-trust lawsuit against Microsoft and in the
investigation of Salt Lake City's Olympic officials. The story
quotes John Jessen, president of Electronic Evidence Discovery, a
Seattle-based company that digs e-dirt out of your computer's past,
who says e-mail is ``one of the most devastating liabilities in
corporate America today. Which is why everyone is so afraid of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rights and liberty: Do sweeping searches of public housing
projects infringe on the rights of residents, if the majority of
the residents approve of the searches? Using the issue as a
jumping-off place, the Boston Review ($3.50) presents a spirited
debate on the concept of rights from a panel of law experts and
professors from universities around the country, including Harvard
law professor Alan Dershowitz, professors Tracey Meares and Dan
Kahan of Chicago Law School and Franklin E. Zimring, director of
the Earl Warren Legal Institute at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mistakes were made: With a cute cover line _ ``Apologize Now!
Everyone's doing it'' _ Civilization ($2.95) paddles in the sea of
``sorries'' inundating the culture. Guest editor Deborah Tannen
(author of ``You Just Don't Understand: Women and Men in
Conversation'') sorts through the mea culpas. Civilization also
hears from ``Love Story'' author Erich Segal, the source of the
line, ``Love means not ever having to say you're sorry,'' to find
out what the heck he meant. ``There may have been a time when I
knew,'' writes Segal, ``but it's significance has long escaped
me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Real raiders of the lost ark: In 1952, a mysterious copper
document was discovered in the same area that produced the Dead Sea
Scrolls, with messages written in a welter of ancient languages
pointing to untold riches. Using global positioning satellite
systems, metal detectors and various translations of the cryptic
copper scrolls, Tucker (Ga.) writer Mike Fillon traveled through
the hills of Qumran this past January, searching for treasure. You
can read of his adventures in the current issue of Popular
Mechanics ($2.95).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Trend alert: Niche marketing gets nicher with Bride Again
($4.99), a new wedding magazine aimed at those who think the second
(or third or fourth) time's the charm.

WITH AGE COMES RESPECT FOR `GENERAL HOSPITAL' PAIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In an industry that considers anybody over 40 a
senior citizen, John Ingle and Anna Lee are an anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   The two, cornerstones of TV's venerable ``General Hospital,''
play characters who, respectively, meddle and mend, coerce and
cajole, scheme and soothe.
</P>
<P>
   Ingle, who plays conniving Edward Quartermaine, patriarch of the
fictional Port Charles, N.Y.'s, first family, is a robust 71. Lee,
who plays Edward's long-suffering, genteel wife, Lila, is a
fragile, but still game 86.
</P>
<P>
   And the two, according to ABC-TV viewer surveys, are fan
favorites in a medium that prizes hot-blooded hunks with flexing
pecs and sassy sirens with big bazooms.
</P>
<P>
   Lila and Edward ``are not just wallpaper,'' said Sallie
Schoneboom, spokeswoman for ABC Daytime. ``They're very important
characters that link other characters together and deserve their
own stories.''
</P>
<P>
   And, after a long, dry spell of providing background for the
rest of the quarreling Quartermaines, they're center stage again.
</P>
<P>
   Lila _ fed up with her duplicitous husband _ is having her
memoirs written in an effort to show the world that the big,
battling Quartermaine family has !ital!something!off! it doesn't
have to be ashamed of. But Edward is scheming to derail the project
_ and ``GH'' is hinting that viewers will learn some shocking
secrets about Lila's life as the story unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a story for years, so this is wonderful,'' Lee
said, sitting in the wheelchair she's used since hurting her back a
dozen years ago in a fall from a horse, then again in an auto
accident several months later. ``Apparently I've got deep, dark
secrets in my past _ and Edward knows about it. I like that. Lila's
been so sweet, I'd like her to show a little gumption, a little bit
of the other side of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingle is equally pleased to have an expanded showcase for his
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, of all the `white hairs' in town, I've got the brass
ring,'' Ingle chortled. ``There don't seem to be a lot of older
people with roles in this town.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Lee, who lives in West Los Angeles, has been part of the
``GH'' family since 1978. Trained at the Central School of Speech
Training and Dramatic Art in London, she was a film star in England
in the 1930s before coming to the United States and starring in
dozens more movies, eight of them as director John Ford's favorite
heroine (including in 1941's best picture Oscar winner, ``How Green
Was My Valley'').
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of her career, Lee even did her own stunts,
being shot out of a cannon in one film and diving off a moving
train in another. Appointed an honorary private by Gen. George
Patton during World War II, she spent several months visiting field
hospitals throughout the Mediterranean _ and she still receives fan
mail from soldiers she visited then.
</P>
<P>
   The widow of the late novelist and poet Robert Nathan, Lee
boasts that she's the oldest working actress in TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful that I get to do what I do,'' Lee said.
``I think a lot of the best actors are the older people because
they've studied their profession. Nowadays, the young people don't
get that training.''
</P>
<P>
   For many years, it was Ingle's job to train up-and-coming
actors. The founder of drama programs both at Hollywood and Beverly
Hills high schools in the 1950s and '60s, his students included
Richard Dreyfuss, Nicolas Cage, Albert Brooks, Barbara Hershey,
Stefanie Powers and David Schwimmer. He also taught drama classes
at Los Angeles City College, UCLA and Occidental College, his own
alma mater, while performing for 10 years in summer stock at
Occidental.
</P>
<P>
   When he was offered early retirement from teaching in 1984, he
jumped at the chance _ then began to consider a late-in-life career
as an actor.
</P>
<P>
   But an agent warned him that roles would be few and far between
for an actor who, professionally, was a 56-year-old beginner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You know, it's a young market,''' Ingle recalled.
``I said, ``Yes, but this young market has mothers and fathers and
teachers and doctors and priests who support them. There have to be
roles out there for people my age, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right. It didn't take him long to land roles on
``Dallas,'' ``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' and ``Cheers,'' as well as a
succession of movies _ usually as a judge, police commissioner or
other authority figure _ including ``RoboCop 2,'' ``Batman and
Robin'' and ``Death Becomes Her.'' He provided the voice for the
animated ``The Land Before Time II.'' He also got big, red smooches
from supermodel Cindy Crawford in two Revlon lipstick commercials.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1993 that Ingle, a Pasadena resident married for 44
years and the father of five daughters, joined ``GH,'' replacing
the original Edward Quartermaine, actor David Lewis, who was ill
and ready to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, many younger members of the soap's cast have sought
out the former drama teacher for advice on how to play a scene or
delve into their character.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're there not in a sit-at-the-feet-of-the-master kind of
thing, but we do rehearse a lot,'' Ingle said. ``The minute we get
to work, we go to my dressing room to work on our scenes. It
matters that acting is fun and that you're not scared to death
because you're unprepared. I will do a scene right or I will not do
it. I hope I can show an example that hard work pays off.''
</P>
<P>
   When you put the two old pros together, fireworks happen on
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Edward blusters and yells and connives, then Lila drops him in
his tracks with a well-timed but ladylike, ``Oh, Edward, shut up!''
before wheeling her chair out of the room. It's a payoff fans of
the show relish.
</P>
<P>
   Off screen, there's great affection between Lee and Ingle, who
gently tease and chide each other almost as if they're the same old
married couple viewers see when the cameras are rolling.
</P>
<P>
   And both say they'll stay part of the ``GH'' family as long as
there are stories for Lila and Edward to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my brain stops working or, God forbid, my health would
go, I'd quit,'' Ingle said. ``Until then, I'll be around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll die with Lila Quartermaine's boots on,'' vows Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if she says she will, she will,'' added Ingle. ``You can
count on it.''

VIOLIN VIRTUOSO CONNECTS WITH HIS AUDIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gil Shaham, the 28-year-old heir apparent to
Itzhak Perlman, gave a recital to an adoring audience Sunday
evening at the Music Center. The violinist lived up to his
reputation as one of the most talented and exciting artists of his
generation. He was accompanied with great sensitivity and skill by
pianist Akira Eguchi.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to take Shaham a few moments to settle into his first
and most familiar piece, Brahms' Sonata No. 2 in A major. But he
immediately connected with the audience, and settled into a
beautiful reading of the piece.
</P>
<P>
   It was on the more contemporary sonatas, though, that Shaham
displayed his gift for rendering modern music accessible through
his lyrical playing. He played Andre Previn's Sonata for Violin and
Pinao (``Vineyard'') with all the barn-burning energy it demanded
without ever losing control. After the intermission, he returned
with a brilliant performance of Prokofiev's Sonata No. 1 in F
minor. His mastery of the piece's dynamic and textural contrasts
were remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Fans in the multigenerational audience refused to let Shaham go
before playing two encores: an unidentified, Gershwin-esque jazzy
piece, and the first of Prokofiev's Five Melodies. For those who
missed the show _ or were left wanting more _ Shaham will be back
next month (May 6, 7 and 9) to perform Bartok's Violin Concerto No.
2 with the Phil.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't wait that long, pick up his recent recording of the
piece with Pierre Boulez and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra: It's a
must for Bartok lovers _ and may even win some converts.

SEN. LEVIN SAYS NATO'S AIR CAMPAIGN COULD LAST FOR MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., just back from an
inspection trip to Albania and Macedonia, said Monday that
Americans should be prepared for an air war over Yugoslavia that
could last ``many, many weeks or months.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin was among 21 Senate and House lawmakers who traveled to
the Balkan region to get a first-hand look at the conflict in
Yugoslavia. The group also met with North Atlantic Treaty
Organization officials in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strongest impression I have is that this is going to take
awhile,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said some Americans may have gotten the mistaken impression
that the air war, which began March 24, would be over within a
matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   Levin also said public expectations about the effectiveness of
24 U.S. Apache helicopters being sent to Albania are
unrealistically high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should avoid looking for magic answers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopters, which fly at lower altitudes than NATO jets,
will be used to knock out Serb tanks and other armor.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's bombing campaign against Yugoslavia hasn't interrupted
the Serb assault on ethic Albanians living in Kosovo. Kosovo is
located in the southern portion of Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians have been forced out
of Kosovo by Serb forces and are currently living in refugee camps
in bordering Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said it is premature to consider sending U.S. ground
troops to the region. The Clinton administration has repeatedly
said it has no plans to use ground troops but some lawmakers have
urged the administration to begin planning for such a possibility
in case it becomes necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said NATO officials told him that a discussion of ground
troops is ``distracting'' and would divide the NATO alliance at a
time when it needs to focus on continuing its air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we put ground troops in, there still must be a lengthy
air campaign,'' Levin said, noting that United States and its
allies bombed Iraq for 44 days during the Gulf War before allied
ground troops invaded Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, like most lawmakers, said he supports the $6 billion in
emergency spending the White House formally requested Monday to pay
for the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the funding request, about $5.1 billion, will be used to
pay for the air campaign through the end of the fiscal year on
Sept. 30. The rest of the money would be used for refugee aid.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lew, director of the White House's Office of Management and
Budget, said the United States is paying 25 percent of the cost of
helping the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans want to expand the White House's request to
include funds for a military pay raise and other defense items.
</P>
<P>
   ``This emergency funding measure cannot be shortsighted,'' said
House Speaker Dennis Hastert. ``It cannot simply replace bullets
for bullets and bombs for bombs spent in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the price tag could rise to as high as $18
billion. All of that money would come from this year's anticipated
$110 billion budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said he would support a larger funding bill only if it's
related to the air campaign and providing humanitarian relief in
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Congress could approve the Kosovo spending bill later this week
or next week.

L.A. OPERA' RE-STAGES A POTENT `DON GIOVANNI'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ April has been a red-letter month so far for
lustful old men. Last week a resurgent Hugh Hefner marked his 73rd
birthday in high style at the bunny mansion. Now we have Dwayne
Croft as the ultimate graying hare, Don Giovanni, sowing his wild
notes and offering a master class in operatic acting in an
8-year-old revival that shows no need of Viagra supplements.
</P>
<P>
   First staged at L.A. Opera in 1991, Jonathan Miller's production
takes a subtly class-conscious approach to the story of the world's
most notorious womanizer. Croft, an American baritone with
hawk-nosed good looks, making his L.A. Opera debut, exudes a smarmy
suavity when dealing with social equals, a condescending swagger
and mock-sincerity around subordinates. When the Don makes his move
on the naive peasant Zerlina (sweetly engaging mezzo-soprano Zheng
Cao), Croft's casual ruthlessness insinuates that the girl would be
a fool to pass up her one shot at material comfort.
</P>
<P>
   When another of his would-be dupes falls prey to Giovanni's
seductions, Croft seems to shrug vocally, as if to say, ``That was
easy, huh?'' It's the aristocracy that calls the tune in this
opera, of course, while the working stiffs like Giovanni's servant
Leporello run around mopping up the damage.
</P>
<P>
   That Croft never swamps his part with gratuitous attitude
underlines the production's naturalistic ease, which extends to
Evelino Pido's quietly assertive conducting. Miller's breadth of
theatrical experience pays handsome dividends here, as he and his
performers find characterizations whose emotional intricacies, for
once, approach Mozart's musical complexity.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best example is Michael Schade's superb Don Ottavio,
which the German-Canadian tenor plays as the antithesis of a
puffed-up blueblood. Dignified, cultivated, virile without being
macho, he provides a proto-Enlightenment counterpoint to Don
Giovanni's baroque excesses.
</P>
<P>
   While less startling in their portrayals, the remaining
principals are tough to fault. Jane Eaglen sings beautifully as
Donna Anna, though without quite the dynamic summit-scaling we
might expect from this formidable British soprano. Sally Wolf gives
a movingly tormented performance as Donna Elvira and is at her best
in the great spleen-venting aria ``Mi tradi quell'alma ingrata.''
Homegrown bass-baritone Richard Bernstein locates a believably
anxious humanity in Leporello's comic shtick, and Louis Lebherz is
a solid, if not especially spooky, Commendatore.
</P>
<P>
   The abstracted columns and pale stone facades of Robert Israel's
set design suggest one of those Renaissance drawings of an ideal
city. But there's a sepulchral cast to Duane Schuler's lighting,
reminding us that Giovanni's erotic exploits are, in the end, a
death wish in disguise. Playboys of the world, take note. &UR;

GOLDMAN AWARDS HONOR ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A lawyer in Cameroon fighting the destruction of
Central African rain forests and two aboriginal women working to
prevent uranium mining at an Australian site where their ancestors
lived were among seven winners Monday of the Goldman Environmental
Prize.
</P>
<P>
   The $125,000 awards are given annually to grass-roots activists
who surmount obstacles to protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are very high. All the activities that are
destroying the environment bring a lot of money to the people doing
it,'' said recipient Samuel Nguiffo, who traveled from Cameroon to
San Francisco for Monday's award ceremony. ``What we are doing is
seen by them as a way to reduce or stop their incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Nguiffo, 33, directs the Center for Environment and Development
in Yaounde, Cameroon's capital. He and his organization have worked
to educate forest dwellers about agriculture that doesn't rely on
cutting down trees.
</P>
<P>
   Nguiffo said he would use part of the prize money to start a
teaching farm where villagers can learn about sustainable
agriculture methods.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqui Katona and Yvonne Margarula hope to preserve the
ancestral land of the Mirrar aborigines in Kakudu _ Australia's
largest national park that also contains Jabiluka, one of the
world's largest uranium deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Mining is prohibited in the park, but mining has been approved
in Jabiluka. Opponents say the activity will release material that
will remain radioactive for some 300,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   The national park contains 196 aboriginal art sites and has been
designated as a World Heritage site for its cultural and natural
significance.
</P>
<P>
   Katona and Margarula have mounted protests against the mining,
including a massive on-site act of civil disobedience that drew
5,000 people over a several month period.
</P>
<P>
   Katona, 33, was one of those arrested, serving 10 days in jail
last year. She and Margarula, 41, hope to convince the World
Heritage Committee to designate the park as endangered to stop the
mining.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be an extreme embarrassment for the government,''
Katona said. ``Morally the case has already been argued
successfully, but the government is prepared to be recalcitrant.''
</P>
<P>
   Katona traces her activism to her family's heritage as Mirrar
people. She said her mother was removed from her family as a child
and raised in an institution. Later she was told her family had
died. Katona moved to Jabiluka about 10 years ago, where, she said,
illiteracy and poverty are widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Katona is executive director of the Gundjehmi Aboriginal
Corporation, a Mirrar-run nonprofit organization. Margarula is
chairwoman of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The prizes were created in 1990 by philanthropists Richard N.
Goldman and the late Rhoda Goldman, the great-grand-niece of Levi
Strauss, to honor the world's outstanding environmental heroes.
</P>
<P>
   This year's winners were selected from nominations anonymously
submitted by a network of 21 environmental groups around the world
and a panel representing nearly 50 nations. The other winners
include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ka Hsaw Wa, from the Karen ethnic minority in Burma, who has
endured torture and risked death to oppose environmental and human
rights policies of the military government. He documented forced
labor, execution, rape and confiscation of property carried out by
the military in support of a pipeline project by an international
consortium.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bernard Martin of Canada, a fourth-generation fisherman who
advocated reduced fishing quotas after seeing that factory trawlers
were decimating once-abundant species in the Grand Banks cod
fishery. He has traveled around the world with an organization he
co-founded educating the public about the perils of over-fishing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jorge Varela, a Honduran who promoted a model of shrimping
that respects fragile resources in the Gulf of Fornseca, where
commercial shrimp farms have led to clearing of coastal mangrove
forests, poisoning of estuaries and the loss of common fishing
grounds. Varela is a co-founder of an organization that has secured
two consecutive moratoriums on the expansion of shrimp farming.
</P>
<P>
   _ Michal Kravcik of Slovakia, a hydrologist who succeeded in
gathering support to stop an environmentally destructive dam that
had been planned during the Communist era.

RESEARCH LINKS SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH TO HEREDITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By NANCY BETH JACKSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   French scientists say they have documented that sudden cardiac
death, like cardiovascular diseases, may be hereditary.
</P>
<P>
   In a long-term study of middle-aged Parisian civil servants,
French researchers have found that workers with one parent who died
suddenly were almost twice as likely to die that way themselves.
The risk was nine times as great if both parents had died within an
hour of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The workers also tended to die at about the same ages as their
parents, said Dr. Xavier Jouven, the lead author of the study,
reported in the current issue of Circulation, a journal of the
American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a positive and significant correlation in the study,
but the goal of the article was to provide information, not to make
predictions,'' said Jouven, a cardiologist at Boucicaut Hospital in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Every year in the United States, about 250,000 men and women
suffer a sudden cardiac death, with only about half of them
suspecting they have cardiovascular problems, according to the
American Heart Association. The attack may be the first sign of
heart disease. As the name implies, many victims die before they
can receive treatment.
</P>
<P>
   For purposes of the study, Jouven and his associates defined
sudden cardiac death as natural death that occurs within an hour
after onset of symptoms, which are similar to those of a heart
attack, whether or not heart disease was previously diagnosed in
the victim.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic link has long been suspected, but information has
tended to be gathered retroactively in interviews with surviving
family members, which may not be accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The French study was based on medical information gathered
through physical examinations and questionnaires administered to
more than 7,000 men aged 43 to 52, from 1967 to 1972. Researchers
followed them for an average of 23 years, including after
retirement, tracking cause of death and correlating the information
with history of parental sudden death. The researchers found that
22 (18.6 percent) of the 118 men who had sudden cardiac deaths had
a parental history of that type of death.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that many of the factors that increase the risks
of heart disease, like smoking, extra weight and lack of exercise,
also raised the risk of sudden cardiac death.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Valentin Fuster, director of the Zena and Michael A. Wiener
Cardiovascular Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York and
president of the American Heart Association, encouraged people with
a family history of sudden cardiac death to examine their habits
and take advantage of cardiac screenings. Only men were studied,
but other studies have shown that sudden cardiac death also affects
women, though at lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we don't know if a parental history of sudden death is
also an independent risk factor for women, it would be prudent for
women who have a family history of sudden death also to consider
preventive health measures,'' Jouven said.

   Corp. The departure of Chief Executive Officer Eckhard Pfeiffer
and Chief Financial Officer Earl Mason came after the company's
profits were
</P>
<P>
   dragged down by declining sales and a shift by users into
lower-margin machines.
</P>
<P>
   But there's good news too, as seen by Microsoft
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Bill Gates, a Comdex keynote speaker: Sales
</P>
<P>
   of personal computers continue to rise rapidly. Some
</P>
<P>
   100 million PCs will be sold this year, Gates said, including
7.6 million laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Those purchases are increasingly tied to consumers interest in
cyberspace. Gates estimated that 42 percent of
</P>
<P>
   adult Americans now have Internet access at home
</P>
<P>
   while virtually every office worker is
</P>
<P>
   able to get online through a business link.
</P>
<P>
   A major growth area, said Howard Anderson,
</P>
<P>
   managing director of the Yankee Group, an industry
</P>
<P>
   consulting firm, is broadband access, through
</P>
<P>
   digital subscriber lines or cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 10 percent of U.S. homes have a high-speed connection
to the
</P>
<P>
   Internet. High-speed access enhances multimedia
</P>
<P>
   services as music and video, while vastly increasing
</P>
<P>
   downloading speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will give up your first-born before you give
</P>
<P>
   up your cable modem once you get one,'' Anderson suggested.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that by 2003, non-PC devices
</P>
<P>
   connected to the Internet would likely outnumber links
</P>
<P>
   through personal computers, which now dominate 99-to-1. These
devices, he said, will include most telephones and range from
television set
</P>
<P>
   top boxes to remote controls all of kinds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not be surprising to see
</P>
<P>
   Internet access penetration of 75 percent by the end
</P>
<P>
   of 1999, which is, more or less, a natural limit,'' said
Anderson. In
</P>
<P>
   the business world, he added, the ability to link to
</P>
<P>
   the World Wide Web should reach full saturation
</P>
<P>
   by the middle of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   These trends, analysts in Chicago said, are
</P>
<P>
   having a big impact on electronic commerce, with books
</P>
<P>
   and music the hottest categories among buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 190 million U.S. adults who bought goods
</P>
<P>
   from any source during the year-end 1998 holidays, 5.7
</P>
<P>
   million shoppers purchased books and 5.8 million
</P>
<P>
   purchased music CDs. About half the overall book and
</P>
<P>
   music sales were on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile and wireless services are also being
</P>
<P>
   heavily showcased in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Many exhibit booths feature small communication
</P>
<P>
   devices, some of which can directly access the
</P>
<P>
   Internet. For example, BellSouth Wireless Data has
</P>
<P>
   showcased its advanced wireless units, which offer
</P>
<P>
   E-mail and links to corporate intranet databases.
</P>
<P>
   As Goldberg, the Ziff-Davis analyst put it: ``What we're seeing
is a fundamental transformation of the industry. We are moving away
from
</P>
<P>
   general-purpose computer design that has been the norm
</P>
<P>
   for the first 50 years of the business to a consumer
</P>
<P>
   electronic device type of design where the demand is

<P>
   for a device to do only a single thing well.''

   CHICAGO -- It takes only a glance at the
</P>
<P>
   268-page program guide for the spring
</P>
<P>
   Comdex/Windows World conference, which opened in Chicago
</P>
<P>
   Monday, to see what's going on in the
</P>
<P>
   computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Computer hardware manufacturers, which at one time
</P>
<P>
   dominated such large trade shows, are gone from the
</P>
<P>
   huge exhibit areas or present only in token strength.
</P>
<P>
   Their places have been taken up by companies that offer Internet
and online networking services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep your eye on applications and back away from
</P>
<P>
   tools,'' advised Aaron Goldberg, principal analyst for
</P>
<P>
   Ziff-Davis Inc., which organizes the semi-annual
</P>
<P>
   event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long era of the computer makers is over,''
</P>
<P>
   said Clay Ryder, chief analyst for Zona Research Inc.
</P>
<P>
   and an early developer of the Internet. ``They are like the
steel companies. There are no real profits to be
</P>
<P>
   found there anymore because essentially they are
</P>
<P>
   selling a commodity.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to highlight these points, the Comdex
</P>
<P>
   floor buzzed with talk of Sunday's top-level
</P>
<P>
   executive shake-up at Houston-based Compaq Computer
</P>
<P>
   Corp. The departure of Chief Executive Officer Eckhard Pfeiffer
and Chief Financial Officer Earl Mason came after the company's

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until last summer, my hometown of Louisville, Ky., was better
known for horse racing and baseball bats than the genteel sport of
sculling. Then, a 35-year-old Louisvillian named Tori Murden set
out from the North Carolina coast in a 23-foot boat with the hope
of becoming the first woman to row solo across the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   A former collegiate sculler, Ms. Murden rowed for 85 days and
was two-thirds of the way across the Atlantic when Hurricane
Danielle forced her to give up. Even though she did not make it,
Louisville was suddenly talking about sculling.
</P>
<P>
   I have decided that I would like to try this sport, which Ms.
Murden had described in interviews as having a mystical allure as
well as physical benefits. When I telephone her, she tells me about
the Florida Rowing Center on Lake Wellington, near West Palm Beach,
where she is planning to brush up on her own skills, so I sign up
for a weekend sculling class for novices.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's session begins at 7:30 a.m., as the mist burns off the
150-acre lake, revealing a mirror-smooth surface. On the pier,
pelicans ruffle their feathers and regard us in silence. The rowing
center, little more than a trailer and a fleet of 30 boats, was
founded by a retired justice of the New York Supreme Court, Arnold
Guy Fraiman, who switched from marathons to rowing out of
consideration for his arthritic knees.
</P>
<P>
   I am in my early 40s, but the instructor, Todd Haynes, says that
many people take up sculling in mid-life. His oldest student, he
says, was 92. I am relieved to hear this, since my exercise regimen
had been a sort of fitness lite, involving twice-weekly workouts
with free weights and leisurely spins on the stationary bike at the
gym. Occasionally, I would switch to the rowing machine, but found
it terminally boring.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike sweep rowing, in which each crew member is responsible
for a single oar on either side of the boat, sculling involves
rowing with two oars. Although there are two- and four-person
boats, sculling is most often a solitary pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Almost anyone can learn to row, Todd assures us. All that is
required is the ability to swim in case the boat tips over, a
common experience for beginners. There are three important rules to
sculling, he adds: relax, relax and relax.
</P>
<P>
   This is not easy. From afar, the boats look sturdy. But when I
sidle up to one of them and try to figure out how to get in, I
realize the narrow boats are extremely unstable. Relaxing in one is
like trying to relax while sitting on a floating log.
</P>
<P>
   Todd assigns me one of the more forgiving boats. Still, it is
more than 21 feet long and only 19 inches across at the waterline,
tapering to a point at each end. I am supposed to steer the thing
with two nine-foot-long sculls, as the oars are called.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the boat, I sit on a sliding seat, facing the stern.
This means I will be rowing with my back to my destination and
turning to look over my shoulder after every few strokes. Lifting
one oar handle, even slightly, causes the boat to dip precariously
to the opposite side; lift the other and suddenly it tilts the
other way. Take a stroke with the right oar, and the boat veers to
the left.
</P>
<P>
   Another surprise: the sculler's legs, not her arms, supply most
of the power. During a stroke, scullers move their blades backwards
over the water, while sliding the seat toward the stern until they
are in a sort of crouch, then drop the blades in and push hard with
the legs. Straightening the legs, then leaning back and pulling
with the arms forces the blades through the water, propelling the
boat. This explains why rowing provides a superb workout; it uses
all the major muscle groups: arms, legs, trunk and back.
</P>
<P>
   Scullers also use subtle shifts of the hands to turn the blades
parallel and perpendicular to the water at different points in the
stroke. Learning to synchronize all the movements to create a
smooth, graceful motion can take months of practice.
</P>
<P>
   Todd fusses over my grip, placing my thumbs on the ends of the
handles, and separating my fingers so that my grip seems absurdly
loose. Beginners naturally grip the oars tightly, struggling to
force the boat to balance. It seems counterintuitive, but a
delicate grip is better for balancing a wobbly boat.
</P>
<P>
   Experimenting, I discover this is true. The boat is very
unsteady, but responds to the slightest movements of my hands.
</P>
<P>
   In the next hour, Todd and two other instructors circle the lake
in motorboats, videotaping students and dispensing advice.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at your hands,'' Todd calls to me. Glancing down, I am
surprised to see that I still have a death grip on the oars.
Offering a Zenlike pronouncement, he reminds me, ``Less is more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Also,'' he says, ``stop watching the oars. Your eyesight is
the very last sense you need. Try rowing several strokes with your
eyes closed.''
</P>
<P>
   I am skeptical, but soon I am balancing the boat solely by feel,
and sensing the action of my oars by their sound alone.
</P>
<P>
   After breakfast, the coaches use the videotape to critique our
performances. The camera does not lie. I am holding on to the oars
for dear life. Todd repeats, ``Less is more.''
</P>
<P>
   After some stretching exercises to prevent soreness, we are back
on the water, and I find I have a new incentive to loosen my grip
on the oars: four nasty blisters on my hands. Novice rowers, it
turns out, go through a lot of Band-Aids.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, my blisters are so tender I cannot help but hold
the oars properly. I have graduated to a boat that is narrower,
faster and less forgiving, but after more practice and another
critique, I feel increasingly comfortable on the water.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday afternoon, I transfer into an even narrower and,
therefore, faster, boat, a mere 10 inches across at the waterline.
The wind whips up, and the oars make a scuffing sound as each
stroke sends the boat zipping across the water's corrugated
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Across the lake, Tori Murden whizzes past with near-perfect
form, and gives me an appreciative nod. I close my eyes and listen
to the whooshing of the seat, its rhythm like breathing. I
concentrate on the splash of my oars, the satisfying tug on my
blades. I am putting together more and more good strokes.
</P>
<P>
   I look up. A pelican glides overhead, its wings a perfect
imitation of my oars. I push harder, thinking that this must be the
most sensuous sport in the world. I am the bird, I am the boat, I
am flying, I am ... suddenly leaning way over to the left, then way
over to the right, then farther to the left, then farther to the
right, then dumped into the water.
</P>
<P>
   I am still not sure what happened, though I suspect it had to do
with forgetting that ``less is more.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, by the end of my stay on Sunday afternoon, I am
comfortable in the narrowest boats. I leave pleasantly exhausted,
with that scrubbed-all-over feeling that comes from spending hours
on the water in the wind and sun.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, I make no plans to row across any oceans, but I do go
out on the river every chance I get. On days when I cannot, I use
the rowing machine. And if I close my eyes and remember to relax, I
can almost look up and see wings. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Sculling lessons are offered around the country at different
times of the year. The Florida Rowing Center operates from December
through mid-May, while others, like the Rocky Mountain Rowing
Center in Lake Dillon, Colo., run from late spring through early
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Many camps charge $75 to $125 per day for coaching, videotaping,
breakfast, and use of sculling equipment, but participants must
find their own lodging. Others, like the Craftsbury Sculling Center
in Craftsbury Common, Vt., offer on-site accommodations as part of
a total package. Peak-season rates, July and August, at Craftsbury
are $775 for a week and $455 for a weekend.

MATCHING PATIENTS TO DRUGS FOR OPTIMUM RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 10 pharmaceutical companies that announced last week that
they were setting up a genome mapping consortium are hoping to buy
a seat at a revolution that may soon start to sweep over their
industry. But like all revolutions, the impending advance, known as
pharmacogenomics, is unlikely to be bloodless.
</P>
<P>
   The basic idea is to match patients, on the basis of a genetic
test, to the drugs that will do them the most good and the least
harm.
</P>
<P>
   This simple concept may engender broad changes. It should mean
better drugs, overall, but they will serve much smaller markets,
and come with complex tests, maybe attracting shoals of tort
lawyers when the tests fail. The drugs should be cheaper to
develop, since fewer will fail in testing, but will cost a lot
more. Patients will surrender a snippet of their genetic privacy
with each test. Health care costs should fall on balance as
patients get more effective drugs, though at higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   If medicine is still an art, it is so in large part because of
the variability with which people respond to drugs. Because
individuals metabolize drugs differently, depending on the precise
genetic makeup of the enzymes in the relevant biochemical pathways,
a drug may work well in some patients but not in others. Most colon
cancer patients, for example, are given a drug known as 5-FU, but
only 30 percent respond to it.
</P>
<P>
   A valuable drug may also be safe for most people but cause side
effects in a small minority. Zyflo, a drug for chronic asthma,
causes side effects that include liver failure in 4 percent of
patients. Drug side effects in general have been estimated to cause
106,000 deaths a year, the fourth-largest cause of death in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic tests that could predict the positive and adverse
responses should in principle match drugs to the subgroups that
would most benefit from them. ``Lazarus'' drugs, those that failed
because of side effects, could be resurrected and sold to patients
whose genetic profile proved they were not the kind whom the drug
would kill.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in drug responses has long been studied by
experts known as pharmacogeneticists. With new methods for
examining the full set of human genes, or genome, it is now
possible to do pharmacogenetics on a genome-wide scale, hence the
name pharmacogenomics.
</P>
<P>
   One kind of test is based on identifying the small variations in
people's DNA where a single nucleotide, or unit of DNA, differs
from the standard sequence. These single nucleotide polymorphisms,
or SNPs (pronounced ``snips''), serve to fingerprint people's DNA
so well that they can be used to trace particular variants of
common genes, such as those that cause disease.
</P>
<P>
   Drug experts hope that merely by associating a particular
pattern of SNPs with a positive response to a drug they will be
able to define the subset of the population for whom the drug would
work best.
</P>
<P>
   Genset, a biotech company in Paris built around the work of Dr.
Daniel Cohen, has constructed a human genome map of 60,000 SNPs.
The company is searching for a pattern of SNPs that will predict
the likelihood of developing side effects to the asthma drug Zyflo,
which is made by Genset's partner, Abbott Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The SNP Consortium announced last week by 10 pharmaceutical
companies and Wellcome Trust of London plans to develop a
finer-grained map made of 300,000 SNPs. The map will be placed in
the public domain from the first moment of its construction.
</P>
<P>
   There are several other ways besides SNPs of monitoring changes
in genetic activity. The genes in diseased cells often show a
different pattern of activity, or expression, from that of normal
cells. Millennium Predictive Medicine, a division of Millennium
Pharmaceuticals of Cambridge, Mass., is looking at changes in
proteins and in messenger RNA, the intermediaries between the genes
and the proteins they specify, as well as at SNPs.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Conway, president of Millennium Predictive Medicine,
said that based on these patterns he hoped to develop a test
predicting which of the available breast cancer drugs would be best
for a given patient. The company is working on similar tests for
ovarian and cervical cancer with Becton Dickinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Pap smear used today we are waiting to see abnormal
cells,'' Conway said. ``But in the future we will identify
differential expression that shows up before you can see visual
changes in the cell.''
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacogenomic tests would also make drug development
considerably more sophisticated, although at a cost. The obvious
downside for pharmaceutical companies is that the tests will
fragment the market for a drug by showing it is ideal for only a
small genetic subset of the patient population. Critics have
scoffed that pharmacogenomics will make every drug an orphan.
(``Orphan'' drugs are those with potential sales of less than
200,000 people a year, so unenviable a market that the Food and
Drug Administration offers tax breaks to companies that make such
drugs.)
</P>
<P>
   There's an obvious advantage, too: Companies will be able
exclude from clinical trials the patients likely to have unpleasant
side effects. More drugs will pass clinical trials, but they will
have to be administered with a genetic test, and the drug and test
package will doubtless command premium prices.
</P>
<P>
   Conway believes the demand for such tests is sure to increase.
``At present, when there are two or three drugs available for a
disease, the physician is basically guessing which one is best,''
he said. ``But if there's a test, my guess is they will all use
it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the first tests are successful, that will create a demand for
more tests, and regulators will then require new drugs to be
packaged with genetic tests, Conway predicts. ``Instead of a
company wanting one drug that fits all, they will want to develop a
portfolio of five drugs, one of which will match whatever category
you fall into,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This brave new world of pharmacogenomics will require a lot of
genetic testing, conceivably one with every aspirin, and that
raises concerns about privacy. Probably each test will narrowly
measure genetic elements associated with the drug in question,
revealing little else about a person's genotype. But if large
amounts of genetic information about individual patients should get
into health care company databases, the need to safeguard privacy
would become even more acute.

FLYING FISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Why do flying fish fly?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. The several species of oceanic flying fish seem to take
flight either when they are alarmed or when they are attracted by a
light shining in the night, according to the Encyclopedia of
Fishes: A Comprehensive Illustrated Guide by International Experts
(Academic Press, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Most flying fishes belong to the family Exocoetidae and live in
the surface waters of all tropical oceans. They are able to leap
out of the water and glide above it because they have overdeveloped
pectoral fins and in some cases pelvic fins as well. Related
species called halfbeaks skip along the surface but do not become
fully airborne.
</P>
<P>
   The flying fish that have two pairs of ``wings'' build up
swimming speed much as an airplane taxis before takeoff; they
gather speed at the surface by sweeping the tailfin rapidly from
side to side, vibrating it like an outboard motor.
</P>
<P>
   Having reached speeds that sometimes exceed 35 miles an hour,
they finally launch themselves into the air. Flights last from
about 10 seconds to as long as 30 seconds and may carry the fish
650 feet or more from the launching point.
</P>
<P>
   Flying fish species range from about 5{ inches to 20 inches in
length. They are often good eating, and one technique of fishing
for them relies on their attraction to light. A fishmerman may
simply anchor a canoe with a foot or two of water in it and a
lantern hanging over it. The next morning, the boat may be full of
fresh fish trapped in water too shallow for them to make a takeoff.

   Sniffle-and-Sneeze Hotbeds in a Hot Race
</P>
<P>
   Early last week, Atlanta was in the news for its astonishingly
high pollen count: 4,371 grains of tree-spawned pollen per cubic
meter. The National Allergy Bureau, a nonprofit pollen-counting
network that provides local readings three times each week from
stations across the United States, considers up to 15 pollen grains
per cubic meter a low count, and any reading over 1,500 as ``very
high.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost before the pollen could settle in Atlanta, a new
front-runner in the runny-nose, itchy-eye derby emerged. Tulsa,
Okla., reported a tree-spawned pollen count of 6,299, while Kansas
City, Mo., and St. Louis entered the very high zone with tallies of
1,992 and 2,520, respectively, making all three places hotbeds for
histamine production.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pollen is higher this year than last year,'' said Dr.
David Hurewitz, professor of medicine at the University of
Oklahoma-Tulsa and a pollen counter for the National Allergy
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oklahoma is located in the middle of a variety of plant types
from cottonwood to pecan,'' Hurewitz said.
</P>
<P>
   This time of the year, pollen from trees is responsible for most
sniffles and sneezes. Grass becomes more irritating in May and
June, and ragweed causes late summer and fall hay fever for many
people.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology says that
weather conditions can make the pollen count rise or fall. ``Warm,
windy and dry conditions create the perfect environment for the
dissemination of pollen, which can travel up to 400 miles from its
origin,'' said Dr. Donald Pulver, another pollen counter and
allergist in private practice in Rochester, N.Y. On the other hand,
``Heavy spring rainfall reduces the amount of pollen in the air,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, Detroit, Indianapolis, Tampa, Fla., Las Vegas, and
Austin, Texas, all ranked ``high '' on the tree-pollen charts. No
figures were available for New York City, but Rochester checked in
at 143, making it ``high'' on the charts.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the pollen spectrum, Baltimore, Washington,
Pittsburgh and Miami showed pollen counts of 81, 88, 41 and 10, in
the low to moderate range, making them temporary havens for those
who are allergic.

   Testing the Smells of Joy and Fear
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands,'' goes the
song. But if a new study is correct, a better suggestion might be
to cover your armpits.
</P>
<P>
   Like other animals, humans appear to send complicated signals
about their emotional states through shifts in their body odor,
said Dr. Denise Chen, a postdoctoral fellow at Monell Chemical
Senses Center in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   In research presented last week at the Association for
Chemoreception Sciences meeting in Sarasota, Fla., Dr. Chen and a
co-author, Dr. Jeannette Haviland-Jones of Rutgers University,
found that other humans seemed able to read these signals
correctly, identifying people who were happy or afraid by sniffing
their underarm odor.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, 25 men and women were asked to wear cotton
underarm pads while they watched an excerpt from the movie ``Ace
Ventura, Pet Detective.'' They then exchanged the pads for clean
ones and watched a scary scene from the movie ``Indiana Jones and
the Temple of Doom.''
</P>
<P>
   The used underarm pads were sorted by mood and by gender, and
stored in glass bottles. A ``control'' bottle contained unscented
cotton pads. One week later, 77 male and female subjects were asked
to sniff the bottles and identify which one contained ``the odor of
people when they are happy,'' and which held ``the odor of people
when they are afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Both male and female subjects succeeded in identifying the smell
of fright at a rate better than chance, the researchers found. But
while women accurately picked out the odor of both male and female
happiness, men in the study could only identify the happy odor when
it had been emitted by a woman. Several subjects said after the
experiment that the ``fear'' odor was stronger and more unpleasant
than the ``happy'' odor.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that olfactory signals carry information about
emotional states has been found in many species, including
earthworms, ticks, honeybees, minnows, rats and mice, Dr. Chen
said. And in folklore, people are said to have a ``foul'' odor when
they are afraid, or to smell ``sweet'' when they are happy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Chen said her study was the first to test whether humans
also signaled moods with changes in odor.

   What's Wrong? Ask Patient, Not Doctor
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the doctor doesn't know best. In a study from Purdue
University, published this month in the American Sociological
Review, researchers suggest that people, particularly
African-Americans, may be better predictors of their health than
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   In the study of about 7,000 patients ages 25 to 74 that began in
1971, Dr. Kenneth Ferraro and his colleagues asked participants to
answer a questionnaire about diseases they had and to rate their
overall health from poor to excellent.
</P>
<P>
   Then a physician reviewed the patients' comments, conducted an
extensive health examination and made a separate assessment of the
patients' health. About 20 years later, Ferraro compiled records of
patients who had died and compared their self-assessments of health
with the physicians' evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In each case, the patient's self-report of health, including
what diseases he or she had, was an equal or better predictor of
how long he would live compared to the physician's assessment,''
said Ferraro, a sociology professor at Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest discrepancies was between African-Americans'
health assessments and how healthy the white physicians in the
study perceived them to be. ``The results of the physician
examinations did not predict African-American health well at all,''
Ferraro said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers suspect that either the doctors did less thorough
examinations of the African-American patients or the patients did
not disclose full information to the doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies have suggested that in medical situations where
doctor and patient are of different ethnic backgrounds,
communication between the patient and the doctor can be limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-Americans have, in the past, faced economic,
geographical and cultural barriers in receiving health care,'' said
Dr. Stephen Thomas, director of the Institute for Minority Health
Research at the Emory University School of Public Health in
Atlanta. ``This historical discrimination may have caused some
subjects to be mistrustful of the medical system and not as open
with the doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Blendon, a professor of health policy at the Harvard
School of Public Health, called the study a ``wake-up call for
doctors to listen carefully to their patients.'' But it does not
mean that people should try to diagnose themselves, Blendon added.

   Doctors' Choice of Drugs May Be Influenced by Ads
</P>
<P>
   A team of Massachusetts General Hospital researchers has found
that advertising may influence the choice of hypertension drugs
that doctors prescribe for their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Though the doctors said they could not prove the link between
the ads doctors see and the drugs they prescribe, they believed
that marketing efforts might have spurred physicians to switch from
older, established, less expensive high-blood-pressure medications
to newer, costlier drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a good amount of information suggesting that
physicians aren't following the national guidelines for treating
hypertension, which call for beta blockers and diuretics to be used
as first-line treatment for most patients,'' said Dr. Randall
Stafford, the study's senior author.
</P>
<P>
   The authors point out that the use of newer classes of drugs _
ACE inhibitors, which interfere with production of a chemical that
constricts arteries, and calcium channel blockers, which reduce the
heart rate and relax blood vessels _ has increased dramatically
since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, say the authors, ads in selected issues of the
New England Journal of Medicine for calcium channel blockers
quadrupled from 1985 to 1996, while ads for beta blockers decreased
from 12.4 percent to 0 percent and those for ACE inhibitors dropped
from 4.2 percent to 0 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't suggest that anyone stop taking a medication that is
working for them,'' said Stafford. ``But patients who are about to
start a medication may want to discuss the benefits of the various
drugs with their doctors before deciding on their individual
treatment plans.''

<P>
   In the 14 years since discovering he has Parkinson's disease,
Steve Ashworth has slowly lost control of his muscles. Two years
ago, with simple tasks like brushing his teeth becoming next to
impossible, he eagerly signed up for a chance to stave off his
slide into immobility, the first government-financed study of
brain-cell transplants using tissue from aborted fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   But the use of fetal cells was not all that made the experiment
controversial. Like all 40 people who enrolled, Ashworth, a
53-year-old labor negotiator for General Motors, would have to
undergo brain surgery: four tiny holes drilled into the skull
through the wrinkle lines above his eyebrows. Yet only half the
participants would get the tissue. The other half would get
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, Ashworth flew from his home in Martinsburg, W.Va.,
to Denver for the surgery. Lying sedated on the operating table,
with a stainless steel halo bolted to his head, he listened
carefully to the doctors' conversation, hoping for clues about
whether he would receive the cells that might repair his damaged
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen months later, in August 1998, came the official word:
His surgery was a fake. He has since been waiting for the study
results to decide if he wants the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it sounded like my best chance of walking away''
from the disease, Ashworth said. ``My life has been on hold,
waiting for this study to come to a conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the wait will be over for Ashworth and tens of
thousands of Parkinson's patients who have seen their symptoms
worsen while fetal cell research became caught up in abortion
politics. At a conference in Toronto, Dr. Curt Freed, the
University of Colorado neuroscientist who led the study, will
announce his results, 11 years after President Reagan first banned
the use of taxpayer money for such research, and six years after
President Clinton lifted that ban.
</P>
<P>
   As the first placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial using
fetal cells for Parkinson's, the study is what scientists call a
``proof of principle'' experiment, one designed to see if the
treatment has any effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody is going to look at this study and say,
`Wow, that is a cure,''' Freed said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But if the study confirms what he and others have long
suspected, that injecting fetal cells into the brain can help
patients regain lost motor function and reduce their need for
medication, it will undoubtedly generate patient demand for the
procedure and spur further public and private investment in the
research.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome, the study is leaving its mark on
medicine in another fashion, by helping to legitimize the use of
``sham surgery.'' The practice, long out of favor, is described by
proponents as state-of-the-art medicine. But critics, including
some Parkinson's researchers, say it is unethical to use a placebo
that, unlike a simple sugar pill, carries some risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a placebo,'' said Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of
Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the study's
most vociferous opponents. ``It is a phony surgical operation. You
could wind up with a hole in your head for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The placebo effect is well known in medical research, and
experts say it is particularly powerful with a dramatic
intervention like surgery. That has posed a problem for Freed and
other researchers who have performed fetal cell transplants over
the past decade with private money. Although some of those patients
got better, scientists could not be certain if the fetal cells were
responsible, or if they improved simply because they knew they had
been treated. To get a true measure of success, they had to compare
people who got the cells with people who thought they had, said Dr.
Michael Walker of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders
and Stroke, which paid for Freed's $4.5 million study.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to end up treating thousands of patients this
way in the future,'' Walker said, ``we jolly well better know
whether it is effective.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that thousands of patients will be getting fetal
cells anytime soon, because the surgery is complicated and aborted
fetuses are hard to obtain. But if Freed's research shows real
promise, experts say, scientists will quickly turn their attention
to finding alternate sources of the tissue, perhaps through another
controversial area of investigation that has touched off an
abortion rights controversy, the use of stem cells that come from
human embryos.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million Americans suffer from Parkinson's disease, a
degenerative condition that kills the brain cells that produce
dopamine, a neurochemical that controls motor function. Stiffness
and tremors are the primary symptoms. Ashworth wakes up each
morning so bent over, he says, that he shuffles around ``like a
70-year-old'' until his medication kicks in. His speech is affected
as well; he talks softly and slowly, as though his mouth needs time
to get out the words his brain is telling him to say.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are a handful of medications for Parkinson's disease, but
they eventually stop working, leaving patients to face a future
that Ashworth says ``can scare the wits out of you. You wind up
bedridden and unable to control your bodily movements, but your
brain is intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Freed, who at 56 has spent his entire career studying
Parkinson's, said he concluded in the early 1980s that ``drugs
would not be the answer, that we had to approach the disease with a
dynamic cell therapy'' to restore the missing dopamine. From
studies on rats, he knew that dopamine-producing cells could be
taken from an embryo and placed in the brain, and that the cells
would survive. By 1988, he was planning to perform the surgery on
people.
</P>
<P>
   In March of that year, the Reagan administration imposed a
moratorium on federal financing for all medical research involving
fetal tissue. That November, on the same day George Bush was
elected president, Freed performed the first fetal cell transplant
in the United States. The patient was a retired factory manager,
Don Nelson, who had been fighting Parkinson's for 20 years; the
operation was paid for with private money.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Nelson, 62, is doing well enough to help his son build a
house. The cells from the first transplant have died off; he had a
second one five years ago. ``It has helped me immensely,'' he said.
``Screws and nails and things were hard to hold. I could hardly
pick them up and now there's no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush left the ban intact, Freed continued his work,
operating with private money. So did a handful of others, including
researchers at Yale University led by Dr. Gene Redmond. When
Clinton, who had pledged to rescind the ban, was elected, the
researchers began preparing federal grant applications.
</P>
<P>
   Freed teamed up with Dr. Stanley Fahn, a neuroscientist at
Columbia Presbyterian Center in Manhattan; their study, with its
placebo design, was approved, as was a similar proposal from the
Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and the University of
South Florida. Redmond also submitted a grant proposal, but the
National Institutes of Health turned it down because it had no
placebo group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was not appropriate to do a sham procedure,''
Redmond said last week. He is continuing with animal research,
hoping to perfect his technique before operating again on people.
``I have not regretted that we did not do the study the way they
wanted it done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Freed's experiment, patients were awake but sedated for the
hourlong operation. Surgeons drilled the four holes, clearing a
path to the putamen, a structure on each side of the brain that
controls movement. For those in the placebo group, the operation
stopped there. For the other 20, surgeons inserted long needles
into the putamen, injecting about two droplets worth of tissue, 2
million dopamine cells in all. The hope, Freed said, was that
100,000 of those cells would take hold.
</P>
<P>
   The transplant carried a small risk of hemorrhage and stroke,
Freed said, while the risk of the phony surgery ``is similar to the
risk of going to the dentist.'' Each of the 20 placebo patients was
offered the fetal cells 13 months after the original surgery; so
far, 14 have gone back for a second operation.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is Lynda McKenzie, a 46-year-old former crafts shop
owner from a suburb of Toronto. She had the transplant last October
and noticed a difference within six weeks. ``I'm very hopeful and I
do believe it's working for me,'' Ms. McKenzie said last week. ``I
don't feel at the mercy of Parkinson's so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashworth, who said he understood the need for the sham surgery,
was hopeful too, but cautious. Freed, who is continuing to improve
his surgical technique, tells patients that the longer they can put
off surgery, the better. For Ashworth, the decision will depend on
the results released this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it enables me to get off the medicine, to go to the mall
and walk around without having to worry about am I going to be able
to get back home, then I will definitely go through with it,'' he
said. If not, he will continue to wait.

A LONG-DELAYED ILLNESS SHATTERS A HOPE ON AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The ultimate dream of AIDS researchers is to
find a nonvirulent strain of HIV and turn it into a safe, effective
vaccine. Since the late 1980s, a team of Australian scientists has
believed such a strain existed in a small group of people
inadvertently infected with HIV through transfusions from one blood
donor.
</P>
<P>
   People in the group were never treated for HIV infection, yet
they have carried the strain for up to 17 years without developing
AIDS symptoms. Because no similar group has been found elsewhere,
world attention has focused on the Australian effort to use this
strain of naturally weakened live virus to make a vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientists talked about a Nobel Prize,'' said the
40-year-old donor, John, who dreamed that development of a
successful vaccine from his HIV would make him a medical hero and
rich.
</P>
<P>
   But now the dreams are shattered.
</P>
<P>
   In February, after losing 75 pounds in five months, John, who
asked that his last name not be used, was found to have an
AIDS-related infection of the brain and spinal cord. And two
recipients have shown signs of weakening immune systems but have
not become ill. Three other group members remain healthy. (The
remaining three died from causes believed unrelated to AIDS.)
</P>
<P>
   John's extraordinary good luck of surviving HIV without
treatment for more than 17 years while suffering nothing more
serious than a cold lulled him into a false sense of security. He
was confident that he would escape AIDS, he said in his first
interview about his odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've had HIV for so long, and the worst you'd ever had
was a sore throat or cough, you feel you can go on ignoring it, and
you think why should I start treatment now,'' John said.
``Obviously, I had not learned my lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   John is one of the rare individuals to publicly discuss his
feelings about having infected someone else with HIV through a
blood transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Red Cross officials initially rejected his request to
meet the people he had inadvertently infected. Jennifer C.
Learmont, the Australian Red Cross social worker whose research
identified the rare cluster in the late 1980s, said she discouraged
John from meeting recipients, fearing it could harm him
psychologically. But after learning that John had repeated the
request, Ms. Learmont promised to try to arrange a meeting between
John and any infected recipient willing to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   John said he ``expected that they would have very angry things
to say to me, but if they didn't, then I'd sit down, just listen,
see how they are doing, and take it from there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say I was sorry that it happened but that I acted in
good faith and that it was just one of those things,'' John said.
</P>
<P>
   John gave blood 26 times from 1977 (four years before doctors
recognized AIDS) to 1984. His main motivation, he said, was to be a
good samaritan, but a secondary reward was an afternoon off work.
</P>
<P>
   John is gay, he said. In late 1984, one of the men with whom
John said he had been intimate told him he was infected. John then
got tested for the first time and was relieved to learn he had
apparently escaped infection.
</P>
<P>
   But a repeat test showed the opposite. John was HIV-positive.
Later research by Ms. Learmont's team showed that John had been
infected since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, John was in college, and he feared dying before
graduation. ``I just took things day-by-day, which then became
day-by-day-by-day-by-day,'' he said, eventually forgetting about
being infected.
</P>
<P>
   John said he stopped giving blood in 1984 as soon as he got the
bad news, but said he did not recall why he had donated after blood
banks asked people at high risk for AIDS not to donate before HIV
testing was available.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Ms. Learmont told John that his blood had infected
others. ``At first I felt some guilt,'' he said, ``but then I
analyzed it rationally and realized it was bad luck rather than bad
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   First in Sydney and later in Melbourne, scientists began
analyzing the molecular makeup of the virus from John and those he
had infected. Eventually, tests showed that one of HIV's nine
genes, the nef gene, was defective in the strain identified in the
cluster. Tests also showed that the man who had advised John to get
his first HIV test had a different strain.
</P>
<P>
   By 1992, the Australian team began publishing articles about the
cluster, and they raised hopes that the defective strain could be
turned into a vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   John was elated. ``It was an exciting but unfortunate time in my
life because the corporate and unattractive side of my personality
took over for a while,'' he said. ``I was told there was a dollar
to be made out of it, and I became quite commercial about it.''
</P>
<P>
   John hired a lawyer and financial adviser, signed an agreement
with a company for a share of any royalties, and was paid a small
consultant's fee for three years. ``The thing that most excited me
was how much money I could make out of this,'' and ``the talk about
a Nobel Prize,'' John said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Beginning three years ago, the standard blood test used to
monitor the immune system showed a steady but gradual fall in the
number of crucial immune cells, CD-4 cells, in John's blood. His
count fell from about 600 to 320 this month, with 500 or more
usually considered normal.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors advised John to start taking combinations of drugs that
were beginning to change the face of AIDS by allowing many people
to live with the disease. Doctors also recommended that John take
other drugs to prevent AIDS-related infections. But John rejected
the advice because ``I had it in my head that after 15 or so years,
I did not need to worry about AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Last September, John began to feel tired and lost his appetite.
At first, he attributed the symptoms to work-related stress. Not
until February did his doctors learn what was troubling him: a
central nervous system infection from an AIDS-related condition.
But by then John's weight had dropped to 160 from his usual 235
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The brain infection has cleared with treatment, and he has begun
taking three drugs to combat HIV. Before such treatment, the amount
of HIV in the fluid that bathed his spinal cord was a very high
750,000 and a high 100,000 in his blood. Under therapy, the HIV
count has dropped to 1,800 in his spinal fluid and is not
detectable in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   Many human vaccines are derived from weakened live viruses.
Experiments on primates have shown that a live virus vaccine made
by artificially removing the nef gene in the laboratory has
achieved the best protection in monkeys against simian AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   However, more recent findings have found that some monkeys
injected with artificially weakened simian vaccine have died or
become ill from simian AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   For unknown reasons, the Australian HIV strain had been weakened
by a natural deletion of the nef gene, and it was an obvious
candidate for a human vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dale A. McPhee, a member of the research team that works on
the strain at the Macfarlane Burnet Center for Medical Research in
Fairfield, Australia, said if a vaccine had been developed, he
would have been willing to follow scientific tradition and test the
vaccine from John's blood on himself. But, McPhee said, the new
proof that the strain is virulent has changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Mills, who heads the team in Fairfield, and other
scientists expressed hope that knowledge gained from research into
John's strain would contribute to the development of an AIDS
vaccine. For example, Mills said, deletions of additional genes
from HIV may yet help produce a successful AIDS vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists plan to continue monitoring the three infected
recipients who remain healthy. No correlation has been found
between a declining CD-4 cell count and the length of time the
recipient has been infected with the mutant strain. For example,
the first recipient of John's blood has fared best, but the second
has a failing immune system.
</P>
<P>
   John links his long period of good health to his faith as a
practicing Roman Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   HIV had made him more dependent on God, and faith broadened his
perspective. ``Once you've got to confront something like HIV and
AIDS, your priorities change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Had he not become infected, John said, he ``might have climbed
the greasy pole of the corporate ladder, to get as much money and
power'' as he could. Now, he said, he ``enjoys every day for what
it is and sees life and health as gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   John's recent illness has made him confront issues that he had
put aside. One was hiding his infection from family. ``I was so
terribly disappointed and ashamed when I developed AIDS that I told
people not to come visit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But John said he changed his mind after a talk with a brother.
John had thought only two family members knew about his infection.
But the brother told John that for a long time the entire family
had known and that they had gotten over the shock. ``AIDS has
brought the family closer together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, John says he has returned to work and assumes he ``will
stay well and have a long life.''

`TRUFFAUT': THE SHY, CONFLICTED MAN WHO LOVED THE MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a 1957 article Francois Truffaut, who was not yet a director
but a young and controversial film critic, predicted the rise of
the French New Wave and its reconfiguration of contemporary
filmmaking. He also mapped out the course his own idiosyncratic
work would take.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film of tomorrow appears to me as even more personal than
an individual and autobiographical novel, like a confession or a
diary,'' he wrote. ``The young filmmakers will express themselves
in the first person and will relate what has happened to them: It
may be the story of their first love or their most recent; of their
political awakening; the story of a trip, a sickness, their
military service, their marriage, their last vacation ... and it
will be enjoyable because it will be true and new.''
</P>
<P>
   As this workmanlike new biography by Antoine de Baecque and
Serge Toubiana makes clear, Truffaut's own films were all acutely
autobiographical in impulse: not just the celebrated movies
featuring his favorite alter ego, Antoine Doinel (``The 400
Blows,'' ``Stolen Kisses,'' ``Bed and Board,'' ``Love on the Run''
and the short ``Antoine and Colette''), but even films like ``The
Soft Skin,'' ``The Story of Adele H.'' and ``Jules and Jim,'' which
were ostensibly based on newspaper articles, historical figures or
other writers' novels.
</P>
<P>
   Truffaut's fascination with children (evinced by movies like
``The 400 Blows,'' ``The Wild Child'' and ``Small Change'') grew
out of his own unhappy childhood, just as the central theme of all
his work _ the equation of love with suffering, passion with
obsession _ was rooted in his contentious relationship with his
mother and in his multiple affairs with a succession of women. With
many of his scripts, the authors of this biography reveal, Truffaut
practiced what he called ``verification through life,'' concealing
his personal investment in a story with details and anecdotes
collected from others, details that ``made the autobiographical
more concrete but also more universal.''
</P>
<P>
   The hero of ``Shoot the Piano Player'' (based on the David
Goodis novel ``Down There'') became, in Truffaut's telling, a kind
of double of himself: a shy, deeply conflicted man with a passion
for women. The long confession delivered by Catherine Deneuve in
``Mississippi Mermaid,'' de Baecque and Toubiana contend, was based
on excerpts of a tape Truffaut made of his first live-in
girlfriend, reminiscing about her delinquent youth, ``receiving
public welfare, acquiring her first pair of high heels at 14,
stealing money from wallets, having kleptomania and going to reform
school.'' And the obsessional passion Adele H. harbored for a
British Army lieutenant seems to have mirrored the unrequited
passion Truffaut felt for Isabelle Adjani, the star of ``Adele H.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the authors of this biography (both editors of Cahiers
du Cinema, the French film magazine, which was once home base to
Truffaut) do a nimble job of excavating the autobiographical
sources of this director's art, they inexplicably shrug off any
attempt to convey the power of his movies: their unique blend of
comedy and darkness, their tenderness and sardonic humor, their
anomalous ability to locate the mysterious in the mundane.
</P>
<P>
   Where ``Truffaut'' is more successful is in providing a nuanced
portrait of the director, a portrait that draws heavily upon
Truffaut's own correspondence, particularly his revealing letters
to his friend and translator Helen Scott. The man who emerges from
this book is a melancholy man, awkward yet seductive, generous but
judgmental, a man who seemed incapable of being faithful to a
single woman but who simultaneously depended upon the bourgeois
stability of his marriage, a man who once wrote that his ``critical
attitude'' prevented him ``from falling in love.''
</P>
<P>
   De Baecque and Toubiana vigorously sketch in Truffaut's
tumultuous childhood and youth: the unwanted son of an unwed mother
who spurned him, once she had settled down to married life, as an
embarrassing reminder of her wayward youth. Young Francois grew up
with his maternal grandmother and developed a fierce resentment
toward his mother and a deep-seated suspicion of authority and
convention. After a stint in reform school, he enlisted in the army
but was granted a discharge on grounds of an ``unstable
character.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout these difficult years, Truffaut's consuming passion
was going to the movies. Ever the autodidact, he set himself the
goal as a teen-ager of seeing three movies a day and reading three
books a week. He saw Marcel Carne's ``Children of Paradise'' nine
times and Renoir's masterpiece ``The Rules of the Game'' at least a
dozen.
</P>
<P>
   Under the mentorship of the critic Andre Bazin, Truffaut began
turning his love of movies into a career, and through a series of
wildly controversial essays articulated the essentials of what
would become known as ``auteur theory.'' He would also forge what
de Baecque and Toubiana hail as ``a new form of film criticism _
frank, direct, violent, sectarian, founded on value judgments,
always detailed but often provocative and scathing, with no qualms
about being peremptory and unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Truffaut's writing obviously did little to endear him to
the French film establishment, his first full-length feature, ``The
400 Blows,'' took the 1959 Cannes Film Festival by storm. The movie
won the 28-year-old Truffaut acclaim as a ``child prodigy'' and
helped fueled the rise of the New Wave.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 25 years, Truffaut, who died of brain cancer in
1984, would make another 20 movies, working at a frenetic pace to
escape his bouts of depression. Unfortunately for the reader of
this biography, de Baecque and Toubiana do little to explicate his
achievement. Instead of revealing how Truffaut's work developed and
matured, they lay out a dry, uninflected chronicle of his
filmmaking filled with dreary details about casting and the rigors
of production. Instead of providing us with a critical appraisal of
his work, they give us plodding summaries of reviews and box office
sales.
</P>
<P>
   In the end Truffaut himself summed up the passion he felt for
movies better than anyone else. In ``Day for Night,'' his movie
about making movies, the character of the director, played by
Truffaut himself, turns to his young protege and says: ``Movies are
more harmonious than life. There are no traffic jams in movies, no
dead spots.'' But while his biographers laboriously chronicle the
reasons Truffaut felt compelled to turn his own life into art, they
fatally neglect to communicate the imaginative alchemy and magic he
effected on the screen.

`SPIDERS': AGAINST VIRTUAL REALITY, THE SPIDERS LOSE

<P>
   So what is it that spiders do besides populating nightmares and
hanging around in corners of the house where they have not been
invited? Mainly, as Alan Alda learns in Tuesday night's final
episode of this season's ``Scientific American Frontiers,'' they
busy themselves with weaving their remarkable silky webs, an art
they have perfected over the last 400 million years.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being things of beauty, particularly when the sun
strikes, these intricate miracles of craftsmanship provide food
(the bugs that are ensnared by the sticky strands and never find
their way out) as well as mates enraptured by the melodies created
by vibrations of an amatory spider's hairy legs against the web's
delicate strings.
</P>
<P>
   Alda watches while experts use computers to help them understand
what is in a spider's mind as it goes about its work. Since the
creatures seem to be prone to promiscuity and think that images on
a screen are the real thing, virtual reality must be frustrating
for those hoping to establish a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   A spider's life turns out not to be all romance, however,
particularly in Australia, where vicious looking hunter spiders use
what a researcher calls the ``dynamics of deceit'' to trap and kill
the hosts whose webs they invade. It's enough to give a hospitable
spider a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The program does not fail to note that many humans are put off
by spiders for no particular reason outside of unreasoning
squeamishness. Happily, hope for the human arachnophobe is
available in a report on a woman who overcomes an advanced case of
spider-detestation with the help of virtual-reality therapy. Now
she is able to watch a Mexican red-kneed tarantula crawl onto her
hand without a squeak or shudder. Congratulations. But why would
anybody want to do that?

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cool weather will continue to grip the northern third of the
nation Tuesday as the jet stream dips south of its normal position
across the U.S.-Canada border. In the Northeast, low pressure
poised off the New Jersey coast will circulate cool, Atlantic
moisture westward, bringing spotty light showers to the Northeast
Seaboard. Meanwhile, further inland, chilly light showers may mix
with a bit of wet snow atop the higher peaks of the Catskills and
Berkshire mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Sinking air currents associated with high pressure along the
Gulf of Mexico Coast will bring mainly sunny and warm conditions to
the Southeast Tuesday. Unfortunately, the dry conditions will
likely remain over the state of Florida during the next several
days, fueling additional brush fires across the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The clockwise circulation of air around the Gulf of Mexico high
will direct increasingly humid air into Texas and the southern
Plains. As this corridor of sultry air intercepts a slow-moving
warm front, thunderstorms will erupt later Tuesday over the Middle
Mississippi and lower Ohio Valleys. Winds changing direction and
speed with increasing altitude will induce of few of these storms
to rotate. These rotating thunderstorms, called supercells, are
capable of spawning tornadoes and large hail.
</P>
<P>
   Cooler air will filter into the Northwest Tuesday behind a
departing cold front while abundant sunshine prompts near record
warmth in interior southern California and the Southwest deserts.
Gentle sea breezes will temper the heat along the southern
California coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Warm Alaska
</P>
<P>
   Record warmth was common across the Tanana and Yukon Valleys of
interior Alaska on Sunday. At Fairbanks, the mercury soared to 68
degrees, while at nearby Eielson Air Force Base, temperatures
peaked at a summer-like 70 degrees. The 64-degree reading at the
town of Healy smashed the record high for the date of 51 degrees
while also establishing a new record high for the month of April.
Sunday's warm wave was fostered by stationary high pressure
centered over western Canada, which blocked the normal advance of
wet Pacific disturbances with cold air in their wakes.

   KOSOVO-TROOPS _ RINAS AIR FIELD, Albania _ Paratroopers of the
U.S. Army 82nd Airborne Division stepped off air transports here
late Sunday and early Monday, then made preparations to move north
to the troubled border area of northern Albania. The paratroopers
are the lead elements of the 2nd Battalion of the 505th Parachute
Infantry Regiment of the 82nd. The 505th Parachute Infantry
Regiment was the one Gen. Eisenhower dispatched into Normandy by
parachutes at the very start of the D-Day offensive. This is an
escalation of pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
not only because of the 82nd's reputation as troops who fight to
win, but that the 82nd is the first unit from outside the
traditional NATO troop pool in Europe to be sent to the combat
zone. (Albright, Cox News Service). 20.

   NEW YORK _ The most spectacular space to be opened in New York
City since the renovation of Grand Central Terminal is being
unveiled Tuesday, and like Grand Central it is also a refurbished
landmark: the 140-foot-long neo-classical barrel-vaulted corridor
south of the main lobby, or Great Hall, in the Metropolitan Museum
of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Can you picture it? If not, that may be because for half a
century it has been an architectural Cinderella, its virtues
obscured by the job it had to do. In 1948 it became essentially a
passageway between the lobby and the museum's cafeteria. Its
skylights had already been blacked out and artificial lights
installed during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   For decades it haphazardly displayed Cypriot and Roman art,
which most people seemed barely to notice on their way to lunch.
Grime accumulated. Coffers on the ceiling began to crumble. It's
amazing that no one was conked on the head by falling debris before
the museum shut the space two years ago to remodel it.
</P>
<P>
   Now the skylights are open again: immense shafts pierce the
reconstructed barrel vault, rising to windows 62 feet high. On a
sunny day, light cascades off the walls and spanking-clean pink
stone floor and onto the sculptures, now Greek, which have been
arranged artfully for a change. The corridor has become one of the
greatest public places in the city.
</P>
<P>
   It is being reopened as the centerpiece of the second phase of a
three-part campaign to overhaul all the Met's galleries of Greek
and Roman art. The campaign has grown to $150 million. This vast
undertaking is deeply, admirably unfashionable.
</P>
<P>
   When the Met opened in 1870, collecting antiquities was
universally regarded as fundamental to the mission of a great
museum. The first work the Met acquired was a Roman sarcophagus.
Greece and Rome were the cornerstones of Western civilization, and
all educated children were supposed to learn Greek and Latin. That
was the way of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But tastes and philosophies change _ except at the Met, which
fortunately seems to take the long view of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first parts of the museum to be put together, the
antiquities collection is the last major department to be
overhauled. The initial phase of the renovation, completed in 1996,
was the refurbishment of what is now the Belfer Court for
prehistoric and early Greek art, a large room with beamed ceiling
designed by Richard Morris Hunt in 1902.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase encompasses the immense corridor (inspired
partly by the Braccio Nuovo at the Vatican) and six large,
classically proportioned rooms, three on either side of the
corridor, which were added to the museum in 1917. With the current
redesign, they serve the purpose for which they were conceived by
the architects McKim, Mead &AMP; White, displaying the art that
chronologically succeeds what's in the Belfer Court next door:
Attic sculpture and decorative materials from the sixth through the
fourth centuries B.C., the Archaic and Classical periods.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fair guess that these rooms and the collection in them
have never looked better. For one thing, the walls of the corridor,
which had been stuccoed because the museum could not acquire enough
stone when the place was being built during World War I, are now
sheathed in gray limestone, as had been intended. For another, all
the works of art _ around 1,200 objects _ have been cleaned, a
monumental feat.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation is logical, spacious and handsome, though you
wouldn't quite say it is simple. Antiquities displays, often the
oldest in a museum, traditionally tend to be stuffy and shopworn,
geared to specialists. Objects are usually grouped by style and
material. Endless cases of broken pots come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   In the reinstallation at the Met, Carlos Picon, the curator in
charge, along with Jeffrey Daly, the museum's chief designer, tried
something different. ``I realized,'' Picon has said, ``that I would
continue to lose all my customers to the 19th century if I showed
my art in long rows of objects of diminishing size.''
</P>
<P>
   So works are now arranged in various configurations: thematic,
stylistic and chronological. Sections deal with theater in ancient
Athens, the Olympics, civic life, death, war, education, gods,
myths and heroes. It's interesting how, with antiquities and
non-Western objects, relating art to social and political history
does not seem particularly radical, although with Western painting
it remains a point of bitter contention among scholars and museum
officials who debate whether social history obscures esthetic
appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, rooms of pots now feature related materials to
liven things up and convey a larger sense of culture. A couple of
early-fifth-century B.C. water jugs painted with chariots, for
example, share a case with a tiny bronze charioteer from the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One case of objects focuses on a single artist to illustrate how
archeologists isolate a particular hand. Long wall texts survey
history, terminology, burial practices, artist techniques and so
on.
</P>
<P>
   Only the most patient, diligent visitor will scope out all the
themes and connections, but the best permanent installations repay
multiple visits. The guiding principle here is, as it should be:
Keep your eyes open. Works that have not been seen for years
because they were in storage or that have not been shown to
advantage finally get their due.
</P>
<P>
   One is a kylix, or shallow terra-cotta drinking cup from around
490 B.C., attributed to an artist named Douris. It shows a young
woman at her wash basin, exquisitely drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Picon has mixed in loans as well, hoping they will become gifts.
They include a late-fourth-century B.C. head of a veiled woman that
belongs to a collector in Belgium, the cloth sculptured to look
swept across her face, as if by a gust of wind, and a big
calyx-krater, a bowl for mixing wine and water, from the late sixth
century B.C., signed by Euphronius.
</P>
<P>
   It is prominently placed in the corridor to make perfectly
clear, to anyone who couldn't otherwise guess, just how much the
museum would love to have it.
</P>
<P>
   Picon has made various recent acquisitions of curios like a
marble sculpture in the shape of a pelican's foot shell, from
around 400 B.C., paper thin so that light shines through it, and a
pair of larger-than-life eyes with bronze eyelids, monumentally
surreal. They're not the foundation of an antiquities collection in
the making, but they're smartly suited to a collection already
formed, like the Met's.
</P>
<P>
   The final and most ambitious phase of the renovation of the
Greek and Roman galleries won't be completed for several years. The
restaurant will move, the space it occupies becoming a skylighted
court for Roman art, which it used to be. Administrative offices on
a mezzanine adjacent to the court will turn into galleries for
Etruscan art, special exhibitions and open storage. Cypriot
sculptures will go to the second floor. A new restaurant will be
built atop the octagonal Lehman Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   The museum will end up with 60,000 square feet for the Greek and
Roman collection, slightly more than it had before the restaurant
took over the court in 1948. More significantly, perhaps, traffic
patterns will shift after the restaurant relocates, so that the
entire south end of the Met should more closely approximate what
McKim, Mead &AMP; White envisioned: a soaring, classical suite of rooms
for antique art.
</P>
<P>
   The renovated corridor, now called the Mary and Michael Jaharis
Gallery, will then be the central spine of a museum within the
museum.
</P>
<P>
   Until then it is, above all, a sublime relic of America's
cultural ambitions and insecurities of a century ago. And once
again it's a good place to show art.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the corridor near the restaurant is a
fourth-century B.C. marble head of a goddess. It is said that she
may be Persephone, daughter of Demeter, or Hygeia, the daughter of
Asklepios, the god of medicine, but it doesn't matter. Whoever she
is, she epitomizes what we imagine when we think of the serene,
fresh-faced perfection of Greek art. The sculpture is given new
prominence by the reinstallation. In the flooded light of the
gallery her head shines like a beacon.

SAUVAGE WINS THIRD CONSECUTIVE WOMEN'S WHEELCHAIR RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MONAHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Louise Sauvage finally got out from under the shadow
of seven-time women's wheelchair winner Jean Driscoll in Boston.
But it wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   Sauvage had to win the Marathon Monday for a third consecutive
time, posting a heart-thumping 1:42:23 _ to Driscoll's 1:42:23.
That's right, the same times _ just like last year. It was a play
on pavement, a Hopkinton-to-Boston drama with Oscar-winning
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Sauvage, the 25-year-old Australian, has basically been in a
no-win situation the last two years, while winning.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, she won her first laurel wreath after Driscoll
tumbled at Cleveland Circle when her wheel caught a streetcar
track. Last year, Driscoll relaxed an instant before the finish
line _ even as she heard, ``. . . and Driscoll wins her eighth
Marathon,'' over the PA _ and that was enough for the never-say-die
Sauvage to pass her, though both posted a time of 1:41:19.
</P>
<P>
   Two titles. But a cloud over each.
</P>
<P>
   Sauvage never really got her just reward until Monday. Now she's
the queen again, with an untarnished crown following a neat
threepeat that was well-earned against Driscoll, 32, who ruled
Boston from 1990-96.
</P>
<P>
   ``This win was more rewarding than the last two,'' said Sauvage.
``Unlike last year, I was ahead approaching the finish line. I
admit I was looking for Jean to try to pass me, but I stayed ahead
of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Both women continue to show the world that people in wheelchairs
can be great athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The women's race had drama from the start. Driscoll was the
early leader, for 2 miles. Sauvage was the pace-setter from Mile 3
to Mile 4. Then there was a virtual three-way tie among Sauvage,
Driscoll, and Edith Hunkeler of Switzerland from Mile 5 to Mile 17.
</P>
<P>
   Hunkeler dropped back, and it was Sauvage-Driscoll and then
Driscoll-Sauvage. It was a chess game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big difference for me was the hills,'' said Sauvage. ``The
hills always were Jean's strength. I worked hard on that part of
the race back home in Sydney. I spent more time on weights and
actually racing up hills. I guess I improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Driscoll, ``Louise improved on the hills and I didn't
improve in the sprints, which are her strength. It was a good race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disappointed. Very disappointed. I came here to win and I
thought I would. Louise was just great.''
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll was just inches behind Sauvage during the last
half-mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louise was just too strong in that last sprint,'' said
Driscoll. ``I thought I had her set up to pass her. I couldn't. I
was so close, but I couldn't pass her. She was strong and I had no
room for a move. If I tried to pass left or right of her I'd lose
some time. I was stuck. She made it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Louise Sauvage is queen for the third year, but in Boston's
heart, both of them are queens.

SWISS CAPTURES THIRD STRAIGHT MEN'S WHEELCHAIR TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MONAHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The man from Switzerland, who may be tuned even better
than the watches his country produces, did it again with clocklike
precision Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Franz Nietlispach, 42 of Zeiningen, Switzerland, captured his
third straight Boston Marathon men's wheelchair title _ his fourth
overall _ as he registered a neat 1:21:36 on a sun-drenched course
to beat his closest competitor, Saul Mendoza of Mexico (1:25:18),
by a healthy margin. Scot Hollonbeck of Atlanta was third in
1:27:58.
</P>
<P>
   Nietlispach was a well-oiled machine, defying anyone to catch
him. He finished only 13 seconds off the course record set by Heinz
Frei of Switzerland in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we had a 14-second tailwind,'' Nietlispach joked.
</P>
<P>
   He took an early lead after about 2 miles _ just as he did a
year ago _ and let his opponents see only the back of his head,
almost toying with the rest of the men's field of 57. He seemed to
allow Mendoza, a strong young man who recorded a personal-best
time, to take the lead for the first 2 miles. Then Nietlispach took
command after 3 miles, for which he was timed in 9:20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good,'' said Nietlispach. ``I had planned to get an
early lead but Mendoza did surprise me. I had a hard time catching
up to him, but I did after about 3 miles. I caught him on a
downhill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am weak going up the hills. That's why I have to go out and
take an early lead. If I don't do that, I don't win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was pretty good except for a time when a motorcycle
got too close to me and blocked my vision and I couldn't see some
holes here and there. There was a television camera on the
motorcycle filming me. That was nice, but I needed my vision.
Overall the course was good.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said, ``Franz is a great competitor. I did feel good
taking that early lead, but it didn't last long. He's too good. But
I am happy. I got a personal best and a silver medal. I feel
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollonbeck said, ``I was lucky to finish third. I was bumped
once and took a tumble.''

   MARKET (New York) _ Computer-related and Internet shares dragged
the Nasdaq Composite Index to its worst drop since October. It was
around 5.6 percent. Investors sold Microsoft Corp. and America
Online Inc., among the biggest gainers in recent months, and bought
laggards such as oil, aluminum, steel and chemicals stocks. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average surrendered a 272-point gain as General
Electric Co., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Merck &AMP; Co. slumped.

   WIS-WELFARE (Milwaukee) _ Michelle Crawford's odyssey _ from
desperation to distinction, from welfare to work _ is indeed a
powerful, inspiring story. It is also an incomplete one, at least
in its official telling. After years of severe anxiety and
depression, Ms. Crawford, 39, is indeed off welfare and on the job
at a plastics factory outside Milwaukee. Her diligent record
recently earned her a raise, to $8.20 an hour. But behind the
scenes, her accomplishments have also placed new burdens on a life
that is much more difficult than her admirers realize and less
steady than the Governor may hope. By Jason DeParle.

   NY-ZONING (New York) _ Moving to overhaul New York City's zoning
laws for the first time in 40 years, the Giuliani administration
will propose on Tuesday the city's first absolute limits on the
height of skyscrapers. Also for the first time, developers could no
longer build higher buildings in exchange for creating plazas or
other public amenities. The changes are among several in the
planned zoning overhaul.

LILLIAN WHELTON, AT 69; FOUNDED SHARE THE HARVEST TO FEED POOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lillian Patricia (Rock) Whelton, the founder of Share the
Harvest, a nonprofit New Hampshire group that gathers and
redistributes excess food from farmers' fields to families in need,
died Saturday in her home in Brookline, N.H. She was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Share the Harvest was recognized by President George Bush as one
of his Thousand Points of Light.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do doesn't take any money or any special skills,''
Mrs. Whelton said in a story published in the Globe's New Hampshire
Weekly section on Jan. 12, 1992. ``All you need is a pickup truck
and some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we can't do anything about people starving in
Ethiopia,'' she said, ``but we can sure do something about people
starving in our own backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was inspired to form Share the Harvest by ``The
Gleaners,'' a PBS television show about a group of retirees who
gleaned leftover vegetables from farmers' fields to feed the
hungry. After coaxing a local farmer into participating, she called
some friends and arranged to distribute the surplus produce from a
pickup truck in the parking lot of the Nashua welfare office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know what to expect,'' Whelton said of that first
trip to the city in 1990. ``We pulled into a courtyard between the
courthouse and the abandoned mills, put a handmade `free food' sign
on the side of a pickup half-filled with corn and other produce,
and waited to see what developed.''
</P>
<P>
   The passersby were skeptical. ``They couldn't believe it at
first. They wanted to know what the catch was.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whelton and her all-volunteer organization gathered
leftover fruit and vegetables from local fields as well as
irregular produce not readily salable at grocery markets.
</P>
<P>
   She was raised in Nashua. She was employed by the Bank of New
Hampshire in Nashua for more than 10 years until her retirement,
when she opened a gourmet food business with a friend in Hollis,
N.H., where she lived for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   She leaves her husband, George B. Jr.; three daughters,
Elizabeth Whelton and Sarah Buckley, both of Hollis, N.H., Tara
Marie Dyer of Cape Coral, Fla.; a son, Christopher of Chittendon,
Vt.; a sister, Eunice (Rock) O'Leary of Marlborough, Mass.; and 12
grandchildren.

<P>
   DALLAS _ Nobody can predict whether the Y2K bug will cripple or
inconvenience the civilized, computer-dependent world, but this
much is sure: Preparedness won't be cheap. Some opportunists have
found in the Y2K craze the chance to cash in on customers'
escalating fears. Others who are concerned about chaos spilling
into the streets in 2000 have turned their living rooms into mini
grocery stores. Driving this booming cottage industry are plenty of
people eager to buy preparedness products, even if it means a hefty

attention. Askins said he was drawn to Tyndale's evening classes
and low cost _ ideal for a husband, father of three and investment
firm manager. More important, though, Askins said, ``It lined up
with our beliefs.'' Askins, of Fort Worth, may never see the master
of arts level diploma he has worked toward for four years. State
officials contend that Tyndale is illegally awarding degrees
without approval from the state or one of three accreditation

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A Vatican effort to forge closer church ties

university says. ``I like being a Catholic school, but from where I
sit, if some of these proposals are approved, it would be very
problematic for us,'' said the Rev. John Moder, president of the
4,100-student St. Mary's University in San Antonio. Moder is one of

Dame, Fordham and Boston College _ who are concerned about

CHEBET GOT THE POINT _ AND THE WIN _ EARLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Billy Squires knew. No, seriously, I don't just mean
he had a good idea, or a reasonably educated guess, or that if you
said, ``OK, Bill, if I put a gun to your head and insist you pick
someone to win the race,'' he would shrug his shoulders and say,
``Well, in that case I'll say Chebet.'' That's not what I'm talking
about.
</P>
<P>
   What I'm talking about is that the unquestioned final authority
on all road racing matters in New England, and, frankly, the whole
50 states, knew. He was sitting quietly in the back of the press
room during the 103d running of the world's greatest marathon _ you
heard me, New York and all you other pretenders _ as Ecuadoran
Silvio Guerra was chewing up the course in the middle stages of the
race when someone asked him who was going to win. Without
hesitation, he picked up a piece of paper and wrote down the name
``Joseph Chebet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told 'em at 10K who was going to win,'' he said. ``Chebet
came to me on Saturday. He sought me out. He said, `I want the
American coach to take me out on the course.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Smart guy, this Chebet. The 28-year-old Kenyan had come to the
right person. There isn't a soul on this earth who knows the most
famous 26-mile, 385-yard slice of real estate in the world better
than Billy Squires. Think about this: In 1979 the Nos. 1 (Bill
Rodgers), 3 (Bobby Hodge), 8 (Randy Thomas), and 10 (Dickie
Mahoney) finishers in the race were all Squires-trained members of
the Greater Boston Track Club.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the course, as everyone knows, is Newton,
specifically the hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed Joseph the `move' spots and the `pull' spots,''
Squires said.
</P>
<P>
   Chebet almost had the place figured out last year. He had
finished second, losing the race in the late stages when Moses
Tanui simply outkicked him. He knew he hadn't suddenly become a
sprinter, and that if he was going to win Boston it would have to
be run long before Kenmore Square, and probably even before
Cleveland Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever high-level pointers Squires imparted to Chebet seemed
to take. As Guerra was apparently blowing away the field through
the first 20-22 miles, Chebet was patiently keeping an eye on
things from the middle of a respectful pack anywhere from 50 to 100
yards in arrears. Chebet wasn't worried. He knew that Guerra was
running his first Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on his brainstorming session with Professor Squires,
Chebet started his move in Newton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew that the hill at Newton City Hall was the place to
start and that after that he was going to own the real estate,''
declared Squires. ``He knew he'd be in command by the 22-mile
mark.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The race was great,'' said Guerra. ``The first half was not so
fast, so that is why I decided to go after it at 25K. I was feelng
great and strong. But I am very new to the marathon. This is only
my fourth, and I'm just learning how to run it. I tried to run the
race. You never know in the marathon. Anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The course can fool the uninitiated. It is, after all, downhill,
for the most part. At least, it is until it isn't. And then when
you get to the hills, it's not as if you find yourself staring at
Mt. Everest. The Newton hills are subtly treacherous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course is a lullaby out there for the first 9 miles,''
smiled Squires. It is possible to get out there and start thinking
that it's overrated. And if you're a drop-dead, world-class runner
like Silvio Guerra, you have enough confidence in yourself to go
for it. Guerra isn't the first skilled newcomer to make a fatal
misjudgment here in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left (the pack),'' said Guerra, ``I just wanted to make
a move. I didn't know who was coming behind me, because I was
feeling good. When you feel good, you have to go for it. If you can
do well, good. If not, at least you tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of trying, how about Mr. Chebet? He had become known as
marathoning's ultimate second banana. Second to Tanui here last
year. Second in the 1997 New York Marathon. Second in the 1998 New
York Marathon. Along the way, he was busy establishing some record
runner-up times, including his personal best of 2:07:37 in this
race last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't like to be second,'' confirmed press conference
moderator Tom Fleming, who was charged with facilitating Chebet's
rapid and difficult-to-understand English. ``He likes to be
first.''
</P>
<P>
   Chebet's victory keeps alive the growing Kenyan tradition, not
only here, where five Kenyans have won the last nine Boston
Marathons, but worldwide. It has almost come to the point where in
the world of marathoning it is the Kenyans and then it is Everyone
Else. Against this competition, Guerra had to feel a bit
intimidated, no?
</P>
<P>
   Well, no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to being around just Kenyans; I'm the only one
half-white in that group,'' laughed the half-black, half-Incan
Guerra, who ended up second. ``I'm really prepared to run with the
Africans. They are the best in the world. I am very happy to be
here with these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   So the real winner of the race, as always, was the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must be clever and learn how to save your energy,'' said
third-place finisher Frank Pooe, a pleasant South African. And you
also have to know where to find Billy Squires when you need him.
</P>

<P>
   MORINA BORDER POINT, Albania _ Fears for the safety of tens of
thousands of refugees escalated Monday, as the flow of Kosovar
Albanians crossing borders to flee ethnic cleansing in Kosovo
nearly dried up.
</P>
<P>
   ``These refugees are being detained some place. They're not on
the main road,'' said Owen O'Sullivan, director of the field office
of the Organization for Security and Organization in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs are playing games with them, prolonging their
agony.''
</P>
<P>
   Agony also held tight the knots of Kosovar Albanians keeping
24-hour vigil here for days, awaiting relatives separated from them
in the rush to flee Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   By late Monday a sprinkling of little more than 100 refugees
came over this border point that just Sunday morning had been awash
in cars, tractors and people crossing on foot. The flow stopped
Sunday afternoon, after the Serb-dominated Yugoslav government
announced it had broken diplomatic relations with Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The few refugees who did reach here said the miles-long lines of
ethnic Albanians who had been reported waiting to cross on Sunday
had disappeared. They saw abandoned cars and tractor wagons along
the road, but the only people in sight were Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) reported that western
military sources said tanks were firing on refugees, and the
majority of them were heading for safe haven in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Those same military sources estimated that 750,000 to 840,000
displaced people were wandering within Kosovo province, according
to Angela Walker, spokeswoman for the WFP.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, NATO helicopter crews began arriving here to
begin airlifting refugees out of this border city teeming with
sudden guests. O'Sullivan said the troops expected to take out
3,000 refugees a day from concentrations at various border points.
</P>
<P>
   So far the troops that arrived are American, British and Danish,
and the helicopters are American, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials in Belgrade told BC radio that the refugees
from Kosovo had stopped coming because of the intensified NATO
bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before they said the refugees were leaving because of the
bombing,'' O'Sullivan said. ``That's not the reason they're not
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the disappearance of the refugees terrified
friends and relatives waiting for them here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid they will be killed,'' said Nimani Haxhi, a
50-year-old who drove eight children of his extended family out of
Kosovo on Friday. Walking somewhere behind them were Haxhi's wife
and two eldest children, his brother and sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Since Friday, Haxhi and the children have remained at this
isolated border crossing, sleeping in the car and waiting for the
rest of their family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been cold,'' he said. For his crew it's been very cold,
since Serb militia bashed out the windows on the driver's side of
the car, front and back. He had attached plastic to the driver's
side window.
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed out a bullet hole in the back end of the car,
another going-away gift bestowed by Serb troops as Haxhi drove his
family's future generations out of their home in Mitrovice, in
north-central Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   There hasn't been a lot of food for them. He had just fed the
children lunch, bread and long green onions that a farmer was
peddling from the back of his car.
</P>
<P>
   Behije Nushi also has been living out of her car here since
Friday, waiting for 15 people left behind. Their family chose to
send the older relatives, a man and six women in one sedan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We checked every tractor,'' Nushi said, ``all the day and all
the night.'' Hundreds passed here, often very quickly during the
peak period when more than 20,000 people entered Albania in a day.
There has been no sign of the missing 15.
</P>
<P>
   She is waiting for her husband and two of her children.
</P>
<P>
   Nushi, 49, said her family also came from Mitrovice, a city that
refugees report suddenly was emptied of virtually all its ethnic
Albanian residents late last week.
</P>
<P>
   How long will she wait here?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll wait until the children come -- two weeks, one month. I
hope they will come today, but I'll wait as long as it takes,'' she
said. ``We cannot live without them.''

   TANUSHEVCI, Macedonia _ In the frigid highlands on the
Yugoslavia-Macedonia border, they appeared first as tiny specks in
the distance, almost invisible against a backdrop of high mountains
on one side and the rising smoke of fires in the villages of Kosovo
far away in the valley below.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, they emerged Monday from this surreal panorama, soon
identifiable as a line of weary refugees. The group of nine came on
foot, adults, children and a baby being carried by his mother on
horseback.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, the Hajdari family found freedom.
But it was a rude welcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing the terrifying squads of Serb fighters who on Thursday
emptied their village of Lubishte in Kosovo, they ran headlong into
a country, Macedonia, that doesn't want them, either.
</P>
<P>
   The Hajdari family arrived on Friday morning in these remote,
mile-high mountains, among 130 refugees from their village. They
said they soon found themselves being forced at gunpoint back
toward Kosovo by Macedonian troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, 'We'll send you back to the Serbs. Better that they
shoot you than we shoot you,''' recalled Rakip Hajdari, 49, a
farmer who fled with his family.
</P>
<P>
   The massive surge of refugees from Kosovo into Macedonia and
Albania came to an abrupt and alarming halt Sunday night.
Yugoslavia sealed its southern borders early Monday. Macedonia,
fearful that the ethnic Albanians will upset the social and
economic balance here, has been an unwilling host since wave after
wave starting four weeks ago has swelled the numbers here to more
than 130,000.
</P>
<P>
   With the official border crossings closed, small groups of
international journalists set out Monday to remote border areas on
a hunch that refugees would be seeking a route on the footpaths,
not the main roads.
</P>
<P>
   We found what we had come to see -- a group of haggard people on
the move through rough terrain, fleeing the Serbs with heroic will
and desperate ingenuity given the closing of main border points.
</P>
<P>
   What we did not expect were tales from the refugees that the
Macedonian forces were equally as menacing as the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia maintains an official policy as a reluctant host. At
the border, its reputation is far worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Hajdari family said they and hundreds of others thought that
they had found a safe haven in the remote Macedonian border village
of Malina Maala, only to be beaten and harassed by Macedonian
troops.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 refugees who streamed into Malina Maala over the
weekend were taken in by local ethnic Albanian families and allowed
to stay. They will be relocated to refugee camps on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hajdari family and scores more were forced out of the
village, they said, by Macedonian police operating with impunity,
swinging gun butts and rubber truncheons.
</P>
<P>
   This border area is thoroughly remote, without the prying eyes
of the United Nations or NATO or other international groups in
Macedonia to look out for the welfare of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, the Macedonian government maintains its new policy
is to keep the frontier off limits to outsiders and thus prevent
the Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA, from conducting guerrilla
operations from Macedonian territory.
</P>
<P>
   Others fear it is to prevent the world from learning of the
alleged brutality that may have taken place in these mountains in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the United Nations and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), were denied entry to the
area by Macedonia border guards on Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   We were, too. Police stopped our car, checked our press
credentials and briefly confiscated the camera of a photojournalist
in our small group. They said we lacked authority to be in the
border area and turned us back.
</P>
<P>
   That's when we caught sight of the Hajdari family as they ended
their three-hour trek up a steep ravine from the small Macedonian
village that had been harboring them. By pre-arrangement, a
dilapidated van was waiting to take them to a host family in
Skopje, Macedonia's capital, only 20 miles to the southeast, but a
two-hour drive.
</P>
<P>
   Their story of brutality at the hands of the Macedonians is one
I and other international correspondents have heard before from
refugees. The allegations are virtually impossible to confirm.
Officially, Macedonian authorities deny wrongdoing and say they are
merely seeking to maintain order in a desperately difficult
situation.
</P>
<P>
   But international aid workers fear that there is a lingering and
potentially dangerous pro-Serb sentiment among the security forces
in this former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are just Serbs in a different uniform,'' said an
observer for the OSCE.

TEACHERS WORRY ABOUT QUALITY OF SCIENCE EDUCATION, SURVEY SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new survey of science teachers shows deep
misgivings about how well American youngsters are learning the
subject, a level of concern that former astronaut Mae Jemison
characterized as a ``wakeup call'' alerting the nation to lagging
student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 1,712 elementary, middle and high school teachers
found that about half have little confidence in the quality of the
science programs they teach. The figure is 51 percent among
elementary school teachers and 48 percent among their high school
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 2 percent of elementary and middle school teachers
and 4 percent of high school teachers reported being ``very
confident'' about the quality of what they teach.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was sponsored by the Bayer Corporation, based in
Germany, and the National Science Teachers Association. It was
released Monday in New Haven, Conn., at a Bayer-sponsored
conference on ways to improve science education and recruit more
scientists as classroom volunteers and mentors.
</P>
<P>
   Jemison, the conference's keynote speaker, said in a phone
interview that the survey shows ``what science teachers actually
think about how we teach science.'' The message, she added, is that
``science teachers think that U.S. students do have a performance
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Jemison, 42, was the first African-American woman in orbit,
soaring into the heavens aboard the space shuttle Endeavour in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   A physician who served in the Peace Corps in Africa and studied
engineering, she now divides her time between teaching
environmental studies at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., and
her consulting company _ the Jemison Group Inc. _ in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Jemison also runs ``The Earth We Share,'' a camp to enrich
scientific knowledge of 12-to-16-year-old students as well as
science teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The findings dovetail with longstanding concern among educators
over what many of them describe as the low state of achievement in
science among American students. That concern goes back to the
1950s when Congress pumped millions into science education after
the Soviet Union was first in space with the 1957 launching of its
Sputnik satellite.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, an international science test administered to
500,000 students in 41 nations showed that while American fourth
graders compared favorably with their peers overseas, eighth
graders did less well and 12th graders fell significantly below the
international average. The test, the Third International
Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), was given during the
1994-1995 school year.
</P>
<P>
   The TIMSS test evoked a huge controversy among educators, with
many calling it an invalid ``apples-to-oranges'' comparison. But
Jemison said the new survey of science educators validates the
TIMSS findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a wakeup call,'' she said. ``It is saying we can't
excuse (low science achievement) and say, `Oh, TIMSS doesn't
reflect reality.' The teachers think it reflects how well their
students work or do not work.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey results also contrast the high value the teachers
place on science education and what they perceive as the low value
the public attaches to it. In the survey, 68 percent say basic
science education is indispensable, but only 2 percent said they
think the general public also views it that way.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The United States, Jemison said, doesn't ``need a million
nuclear physicists, but we do need 100 million folks who are able
to read an article in the newspaper about a science subject and
understand, for example, how to vote on the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Improving science education means enlisting more scientists as
mentors and role models for students, particularly girls and
minorities, Jemison said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that teachers should follow guidelines that encourage
``hands-on'' science and open-ended experimentation ``the way
scientists do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have criticized what many of them call ``cookbook''
experiments, in which students conduct a predictable, recipe-like
scientific test and promptly forget the results.
</P>
<P>
   Given a thought-provoking challenge, ``children will use their
own motivation and creativity,'' Jemison said.

Officially, Macedonian authorities deny wrongdoing and say they are
merely seeking to maintain order in a desperately difficult
situation.

   But international aid workers fear that there is a lingering and
potentially dangerous pro-Serb sentiment among the security forces
in this former Yugoslav republic.

TUESDAY'S `ROCKFORD' CLOSES THE FILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fair warning, folks. After Tuesday you can pretty much stick a
fork in Jim Rockford. Methinks he's done.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, he was done about two years ago, but CBS has kept the
last ``Rockford Files'' movie on ice since 1997, not wanting to
clutter the airwaves with too many crime solvers. What with
``Martial Law'' and ``Nash Bridges'' and those ``Sons of Thunder''
guys, CBS takes a bigger bite out of crime each week than McGruff
after he's missed a doggie snack.
</P>
<P>
   Rockford re-emerges Tuesday night and, aside from some obviously
creaky joints, he still has the magic that James Garner gave him 25
years ago. The easygoing charm, the big heart, the impatience with
authority are all there _ as comfortable as that old trailer by the
beach, as predictable as Angel Martin's next dodge.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Angel has only a peripheral presence tonight. Stuart
Margolin, who parlayed the sniveling, self-pitying scammer into two
Emmy Awards in 1979 and '80, spent more hours behind the camera
this time, directing his colleagues in what is billed as the last
of the ``Rockford'' oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
   If so, Margolin and pals went out shouting. Tuesday's film, the
eighth since the series ended nearly 20 years ago, is titled ``If
It Bleeds ... It Leads,'' and it's an all-cannons broadside at the
media's treatment of people who've been charged with serious crimes
but not convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Though ham-fisted in places and unnecessarily preachy at the
end, it's an effective treatment that will find a receptive
audience among a media-wary public and might even get a few
journalists to think about how they do what they do.
</P>
<P>
   With or without a parable, it's always good to see Rockford
again. And Angel and Beth (Gretchen Corbett) and Becker (Joe
Santos), too. Even Lieutenant Diehl (Tom Atkins), still dumber than
a bucket of bolts. ``The Rockford Files'' was always one of the
best things to emerge from the prolific Stephen J. Cannell
production mill. Smarter than most dramas of the late '70s, it also
had one of those perfectly meshed casts that producers dream about
but rarely assemble.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Noah Beery Jr., who died in 1994, the whole gang is
back tonight, augmented crisply by Rita Moreno, who reprises the
role of ex-prostitute Rita Capkovic for which she won an Emmy in
1978. The always solid Hal Linden plays Rita's husband, Ernie, a
dedicated schoolteacher charged with committing a succession of
rapes.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie's guilt or innocence isn't immediately clear, but even
more compelling than the whodunit is a final act that raises
tonight's film above the middling morass of TV movies. If
``Rockford'' is indeed done, it's especially nice that its swan
song was well done.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockford Files: If It Bleeds ... It Leads. Two-hour TV movie
reprising the character of private investigator Jim Rockford.
Starring James Garner, Joe Santos, Gretchen Corbett, Tom Atkins,
Stuart Margolin, Rita Moreno and Hal Linden. Tonight on CBS.
Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: How do you deal with an employee who
does a good job, but whenever there are changes, errors or anything
even slightly different from her way of doing things, she starts
arguing? We have talked to her about this, but she doesn't change.
E.S.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Presumably, when you spoke to her about her tendency to
argue, that discussion evolved into an argument as well. By saying
that this person is doing a good job, you are probably referring to
her technical skills and general ability to complete her work.
</P>
<P>
   However, unless she is working in solitary confinement, she is
only doing a good job in part of her job. If her position is one
that calls for communication, her performance in these areas must
be suffering.
</P>
<P>
   The next time she inappropriately flips into the argumentative
mode, let her know that although there may be a time for her to
assertively express her opinions, constant arguments are costly,
destructive, disruptive and unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   You should suggest that she develop a specific plan to bring
this aspect of her behavior under control. Be sure to let her see
the benefits associated with doing so, particularly in terms of the
ways that her improved behavior will help her meet her own goals.
</P>
<P>
   If she can develop and commit to a plan to change her behavior,
accompanied by your support and feedback whenever she reacts
constructively, there is a chance that she will reduce her arguing
time. The irony is that by doing so, she will see that she can win
more arguments by not arguing at all.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My manager has a hard time pronouncing my name, which is a
popular name of my country of birth, but not here. My manager
decided to give me a nickname rather than struggle with it anymore.
I cannot stand being nicknamed, and I cringe when he addresses me,
but I am concerned about discussing this with him. What can I do?
S.T.
</P>
<P>
   A: When managers do foolish things like this, it is not uncommon
to find that the employees have unflattering nicknames for them.
The fact is that your manager is clueless when it comes to any
comprehension of diversity, fairness, professionalism and respect,
as well as the exposure associated with differential treatment of
employees based on national origin.
</P>
<P>
   The best step is for you to meet with him and tell him exactly
how you feel about what he is doing. Use a businesslike approach
and tell him quite clearly that it hurts you to have a nickname,
and that you want him to address you by your given name. Tell him
that you would prefer to have him try to pronounce your real name,
rather than affix any other name on you.
</P>
<P>
   If he has even a shred of gray matter, he will understand and
respect what you are saying. And, if he misses the point, perhaps
you should mention the names of some senior managers whom you will
have to contact.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have had several different jobs in my career, and I
recently completed a rather expensive training program. I have been
sending out resumes, but all I get are rejections or nothing at
all. I keep trying different resumes, but none work. What do you
suggest? R.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your ``rather expensive'' technical school is giving you
rather shabby career guidance and support. One of the commitments
that many of these schools typically make to potential students is
a pledge to help them find jobs. This means that you should contact
the school, hopefully a career placement specialist, and tell him
or her what is happening and what you would like to happen.
</P>
<P>
   However, you will need to do more than contact the school or
send out resumes. At this point, your job search is your job, and
you need to get up every day and work it. This means contacting
friends, associates, former co-workers, employment agencies,
support groups, and any other individuals or organizations that can
help you on this project. Check out newspapers, magazines, and the
Internet, and do some cold calling to companies that interest you.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the rejection or lack of response after you send out
your resume, make sure that your resume is in good shape and that
you are applying for jobs for which you are reasonably qualified.
At the same time, do not be shy about making follow-up phone calls.
You may also want to experiment with a strong promotional letter
rather than a resume at all. The fact is that there is a good
full-time job for you in this labor market, but right now your
full-time job is to find it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Michael Cunningham was a sophomore in high
school in Pasadena, Calif., he knew hardly anything about world
literature. His cultural life centered on popular music, and he
wrote papers about Bob Dylan's lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   One day, trying to impress a sophisticated young woman in the
senior class, he spoke admiringly about the poetry of Leonard
Cohen. As he recalled in a recent interview, ``She took a deep drag
of her Marlboro and said, `Well, yes, but I wonder if you've ever
heard of T.S. Eliot or Virginia Woolf.'''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of making a joke about liking their record albums, he
went to the school library, where he found no Eliot and only one
Woolf, ``Mrs. Dalloway.'' He read it and was overwhelmed:
``Something about what she was doing in terms of trying to find the
profundity in the most outwardly ordinary experience registered
with me even as a not especially precocious 15-year-old, and it has
stayed with me ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   If the library had had a copy of ``The Waste Land,'' his life
might have gone in a different direction.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 31 years later, Cunningham's novel ``The Hours,'' an
impressionistic response to ``Mrs. Dalloway,'' has been awarded the
Pulitzer Prize for fiction. It was this year's surprise winner over
the other finalists, Russell Banks' ``Cloudsplitter'' and Barbara
Kingsolver's ``Poisonwood Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham was among those most surprised. He was convinced that
Banks would win for his ``wonderful book, a sprawling American
historical saga that was squarely in the Pulitzer tradition.''
Cunningham wondered what chance his ``dark, odd book'' could have.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon the Pulitzers were to be announced, he left his
apartment in Manhattan to have lunch with two friends. About five
minutes after 3, he decided to see if he had any telephone
messages. The first was from a reporter, the second from Jonathan
Galassi, his editor at Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, both offering
congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham started to cry. ``It's slightly embarrassing, but
it's true,'' he said. ``It seemed impossible that this particular
book had been recognized like that.''
</P>
<P>
   His friends looked at him, he said, and they cried. Then he
telephoned his companion, Ken Corbett, who is a clinical
psychologist, and ``everybody else I ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later when he arrived for a luncheon interview, a
letter from the Pulitzer committee forwarded by his publisher was
waiting for him on the table. For a moment, he considered the
possibility that the letter would inform him that a mistake had
been made. It was of course congratulatory: The letter would be
sent on to his mother in California.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, 46, said he considered ``The Hours'' his ``strongest
book by far'' and ``an act of veneration'' for the original, which
is a day in the life of an Englishwoman. It is his fourth published
novel, and it was a long time in coming.
</P>
<P>
   While studying at Stanford University in the early 1970s, he
thought about becoming a painter; then he took a course in
literature and began writing short stories. After graduation he
wandered around the West for several years, supporting himself by
tending bar while he started, and discarded, novels.
</P>
<P>
   Finally he was accepted at the University of Iowa's writers'
workshop and published stories in The Atlantic Monthly and other
magazines. Then he found himself drifting back into his old bad
habits, tending bar and not finishing novels.
</P>
<P>
   His first book, ``Golden States,'' written hurriedly to beat his
self-imposed deadline of his 30th birthday, was ``a journeyman
effort,'' he said. He moved to New York and was hired as a
secretary at Carnegie Corp., where he worked his way up to a
position writing annual reports and news releases.
</P>
<P>
   When ``A Home at the End of the World,'' a novel about a
friendship of two men and a woman, was published in 1990, he quit
his job. That book was followed five years later by ``Flesh and
Blood,'' a chronicle of three generations of a Greek-American
family. Both books received favorable reviews and sold reasonably
well. The two are, by his own description, ``capacious, traditional
narratives that you could walk right into, unhindered.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he decided to try something different and experimental. His
original idea was to write a modern-day version of ``Mrs.
Dalloway,'' set in New York, with a 52-year-old gay man as the
protagonist, a kind of Dalloway, with the AIDS epidemic as a
backdrop for the story.
</P>
<P>
   After writing about 100 pages and discovering contemporary
parallels for all the characters and events in the Woolf novel, he
realized ``it was just a parlor trick and not a sufficient idea for
a novel,'' he said. ``The world didn't need my take on a great book
_ it already had the original.''
</P>
<P>
   At first he thought about dropping the project, but then he
decided to relax and play around with it. What had at first been
``schematic and precious'' became improvisational, aiming for what
he called ``the loose, riffish quality of `Mrs. Dalloway.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As he said, ``I wanted my book to have its own life, not to be
just an annex to Woolf's.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end it became a triptych, about Clarissa Vaughan, a book
editor living today in New York's Greenwich Village; Laura Brown, a
depressed housewife in Los Angeles reading ``Mrs. Dalloway'' in
1929, and Woolf herself in a suburb of London in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   As with ``Mrs. Dalloway,'' but tripled, events take place on a
single day in the life of each of the women, ``one of whom, not
Woolf, is unambiguously a lesbian,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Each story resonates within the others. Some moments in ``Mrs.
Dalloway'' reappear in ``The Hours'' (which was also the working
title for Woolf's book). Both novels lead to a climactic party, in
each case there is a suicide, and Clarissa is herself a version of
the original title character.
</P>
<P>
   But there are substantial differences between the books. In the
Cunningham book, characters are merged, and they evoke distant
memories of their role models. The writing style, though influenced
by Woolf, is definitely his own.
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly not necessary to know ``Mrs. Dalloway'' to
appreciate ``The Hours,'' but as Michael Wood wrote in The New York
Times Book Review, the connections between the two are ``so rich
and subtle and offbeat that not to read `Mrs. Dalloway' after we've
read `The Hours' seems like a horrible denial of a readily
available pleasure _ as if we were to leave a concert just when the
variations were getting interesting.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham acknowledged the possibility that Laura's reading of
``Mrs. Dalloway'' ``has a subtle but considerable effect on her
life, both in terms of the comfort she receives in reading it and
something darker, a certain sense of Virginia Woolf as a dark angel
who has walked into death ahead of her.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the major challenges of writing the book was to deal with
Woolf as a fictional character, to imagine a day in her life.
Cunningham said that in preparation he read, or reread, her novels,
stories, letters and diaries as well as several biographies, and
then put them all aside to write in his own voice.
</P>
<P>
   At various points in his book, however, he quotes from ``Mrs.
Dalloway,'' and from Woolf herself. Her suicide note appears at the
beginning, and a line from it (``I don't think two people could
have been happier than we've been'') is repeated before the suicide
of one of the characters in ``The Hours.'' That choice he
attributes to the ``ghost of Virginia Woolf, it's a literal
haunting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pulitzer Prize has not drastically changed the author's
life. He is finishing an original screenplay and is thinking about
his next novel, and he continues to teach writing at Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
   But the publisher printed more copies of ``The Hours,'' and the
book suddenly leaped to the top of Amazon.com's best-seller list,
ahead of Stephen King. Cunningham said he also heard that because
of his book, sales of ``Mrs. Dalloway'' had increased. Both novels
are short, his a few pages longer. They would, he said, ``make a
nice boxed set.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: A MASTER OF THE TREND OF THE DAY, A SLAVE TO
NONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN RUSSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Two of the most coveted spaces in the Parisian museum
world are being given over to a 61-year-old English artist whom few
people have known quite what to make of. His name is David Hockney.
</P>
<P>
   On the Rue St.-Merri, in the south gallery of the otherwise
closed Pompidou Center, Hockney has a retrospective exhibition of
164 paintings and photocollages (many of them very large) dated
from 1962 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Didier Ottinger of the Musee National d'Art
Moderne, it comes with a hefty catalog in which French, German and
English contributors take it in turn to assess a vast body of work
that has been springing surprises, year by year, since January
1960. At the Musee Picasso there is ``David Hockney: Dialogue with
Picasso.''
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the two shows act as a corrective to anyone who
has a one-focus, one-period, one-medium, one-ambition idea of David
Hockney. There is the work that everyone knows: the repertory
company of favorite sitters, the swimming pools (some in
California, others in Connecticut), the panoramic Los Angeles
interiors and the vertiginous up-and-down and in-and-out of the
roads that so often lead up to them.
</P>
<P>
   But there is not one David Hockney. Without ever flaunting it,
he is a true citizen of the world. He has traveled, read, studied
and looked. Between 1973 and 1975, for instance, he spent a lot of
time in Paris. Echoes of France recur throughout his career. When
we look at his deft and affectionate etching of Gustave Flaubert,
for instance, or note what he got from reading Henri Bergson on
memory, or study his monumental photocollage of the Place
Furstenberg in Paris, we know that he knows France from the inside.
</P>
<P>
   When he was living in Paris, he was already being talked about
and written about. In 1975 a then-young French critic, Marc
Fumaroli, who is now an influential member of the Academie
Francaise, got David Hockney exactly right.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played his part,'' Fumaroli wrote at that time, ``in the
empty-headed circles that his allies and protectors frequented. But
he brought to them the graces of a young person who had all the
gifts. Both as Narcissus and as dandy, he had an innate feeling for
what was the trend of the day. But he never got stuck with it.
Though always ready with the right word, he never lost either his
catlike independence or his colossal capacity for work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sang for his supper,'' Fumaroli went on, ``and his gifts as
an actor served him well. But he was neither the prisoner nor the
subordinate of his troupe. He was all the more `in' because he had
made up his mind to stay `out.' What more could be asked of a great
talent at that time?''
</P>
<P>
   Hockney cannot be pinned down. No sooner did his paintings of
boys in the shower take rank as the epitome of early 1960s camp
than he turned to what he called the ``marriage of styles'' as the
motor force in paintings that were large, grand and contradictory
in their idioms.
</P>
<P>
   Those first major American paintings, nobly shown in the
Pompidou, had nothing to do with the laid-back life of Los Angeles.
``Iowa'' (1964), ``Arizona'' (1964) and ``Rocky Mountains and Tired
Indians'' (1965) are monumental in scale.
</P>
<P>
   Inch by inch they are endlessly beguiling to look at. There is
something absolutely right about the imminent electric storms in
``Iowa,'' the minutely defined geological striations in ``Arizona''
and the presence of an up-to-the-minute Knoll chair in the ancient
uncluttered landscape of ``Rocky Mountains and Tired Indians.'' One
and all keep us alert.
</P>
<P>
   As Philippe Starck says in the catalog, the visual elements in
these paintings take us on a long march through the history of art,
one that leads from ancient Egypt to minimal art. Nor can we miss
the fact that the farm buildings in ``Iowa'' hark back to Cezanne's
preoccupation with the cylinder and the cone.
</P>
<P>
   In the Musee Picasso on the Rue de Thorigny, the dialogue with
Picasso is as much a matter of ideas as of actions, and the tone of
Hockney's contributions is not awestruck but conversational.
</P>
<P>
   He first took fire from Picasso in the summer of 1960, when
there was a large Picasso retrospective in London. The lesson was a
general one: that every option should be acted upon. ``There was no
style and no technique that Picasso could not master,'' Hockney
said. ``What was the point of settling down in one little corner of
art and just painting on it over and over?''
</P>
<P>
   Hockney the stage-designer is ideally represented in the Picasso
Museum by the adorable frivolity of his designs for Francis
Poulenc's opera ``Les Mamelles de Tiresias.'' (One of them is
reproduced in miniature, and rare is the visitor who doesn't crack
a smile.)
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the show is a painting dated 1987 that shows how
Hockney can cut deep when the occasion calls for it. One of the
great moments in all opera falls near the end of Wagner's ``Tristan
und Isolde,'' when the dying Tristan hears the approach of Isolde.
``Now I hear the light!'' he cries out with full voice, and in
Hockney's painting we see that in close-up, unforgettably.
</P>
<P>
   For Tristan at that moment, hearing was seeing, and Hockney
brought something rough and raw to the portrayal of his huge
stricken head. Something of that roughness and rawness can be
traced to Picasso's late figure paintings, in which he strove to go
beyond the previous limits of expression in figure painting.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the Pompidou show, Hockney rides high on the limitless
complication and the brash, aggressive color of his high-flying
Californian landscapes of the 1990s. (The paint in those pictures,
as in the ones done last year in his native Yorkshire, does not so
much portray the landscape as couple with it.)
</P>
<P>
   At the Picasso Museum, the plain white spaces and the vibration
of Picasso's own presence encourage a more intimate scale and an
epigrammatic demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   As Hockney sees it, what had been called ``distortion'' in many
of Picasso's portraits of Marie-Therese Walter in 1934 was simply
the plain fact of what we see when we get up very close to another
person and patrol that person's face. At such times, the cubist
vision is the true one and the standard, long-authenticated image
of another human being makes no sense.
</P>
<P>
   Hockney had more than once painted his friend Christopher
Isherwood in a traditional pose, with spectacles gleaming. But in
1984, when he painted ``Christopher Without His Glasses,'' he
toured the familiar head as if he were negotiating Mulholland Drive
on the way to his studio.
</P>
<P>
   Isherwood's features were ``distorted,'' with eyes and nose and
forehead going every which way, but those dislocations rang true.
This was the real Christopher, alive and complete, just as the real
Hockney is alive, if not quite complete, in these two admirably
thought-through exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   The Pompidou show can be seen through April 26, and the one at
the Picasso Museum through May 3.

 &HT;    WINDOWS 98 GETTING HOME COMPUTER NETWORK FEATURE
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO --- Windows 98, whose introduction at last year's
Comdex/Windows World conference carried some presentation bugs, is
getting an upgrade that includes a home computer networking
feature.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Connection Sharing will allow each user on a network to
share a single Internet link. It is aimed primarily at households
with multiple PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Intel (CQ) announced a network product aimed
at consumers. The chipmaker estimated about 18 million households
have more than one computer, and 28 million will be in that
category by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows 98 upgrade also will include Internet Explorer 5, an
</P>
<P>
   integrated browser.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't Windows 98 that was most on the mind this year of
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates. It was Windows 2000. And unlike last
year, the viewing screen used by Gates to explain the software
worked. Last year, during Gates' presentation, the audience found
itself staring
</P>
<P>
   at a blank screen.
</P>
<P>
   That embarrassing mishap was on Gates' mind Monday when he
demonstrated an early version of Windows 2000, Microsoft's
</P>
<P>
   business-oriented operating system for personal computers and
network servers.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, when the same Gates aide who in 1998 plugged in
the same scanning device to capture the same photo, the demo came
off without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked a lot of people in the last year what happened to
that guy,'' Gates joked.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Microsoft has shipped more than 28 million copies of
Windows 98, many of them installed by computer manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials said the company plans to ship two more
versions of Windows 98. The first one, they said, is to go out this
fall and the
</P>
<P>
   next one, to be dubbed ``Second Edition,'' some time next year.
</P>
<P>
   But current Windows 98 users, they said, may not need to buy
either of the new versions. Users can download the new features for
free from the company's Windows update site on the Internet or
order an upgrade CD for $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Gates said that late this month Microsoft will ship
the third and final test version of Windows 2000 to some 500,000
first-wave customers. This heavy-duty operating system will
eventually replace Windows NT 4.0 and compete with UNIX-based
servers.
</P>
<P>
   Three versions of the last test will be shipped: Windows 2000
Professional, intended for individual users of client servers;
Windows 2000 Server, and Advanced Server. The later two versions
are meant
</P>
<P>
   to run on networks that can support multiple machines.
</P>
<P>
   Gates called Windows 2000 ''the biggest investment we ever made
in a single piece of software.'' He said the Windows 2000 test will
be supported by more than 20 computer makers, 100,000 Microsoft
distribution partners and 140,000 developers.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Allchin, senior vice president of Microsoft's business and
enterprise division, said Windows 2000 will offer major
improvements in reliability and leading-edge networking services.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft expects to ship Windows 2000 in final form by October.

HOSTESS WITH THE MOSTEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Originally First Lady Hillary Clinton was picked on
for being bossy, brassy and too brainy.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's being scorched for planning to oversee a book about
entertaining at the White House in between touring the tragic
Balkans and New York state, both territories foreign to her.
</P>
<P>
   The book is a subject described by her critics as frivolous and
appropriate only for homebodies with not much else to do. And
certainly not a serious topic for a human rights spokeswoman with
global influence and designs on the U.S. Senate seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
   But this political put-down of official presidential social life
_ with its world-class guests, diplomatic demands, expectations of
elegance and public symbolism of national greatness _ is something
new.
</P>
<P>
   The last I heard, invitations to the White House were greatly
coveted and social events there a product of monumental, detailed
planning which even Martha Stewart could not match. Such elaborate
occasions do not happen by accident. They take work. And the first
lady, no matter her name, inclination or staff size, is ultimately
held responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Yet suddenly the first couple is supposed to demolish gracious
White House traditions and pretend that hospitality consists of
serving fish and chips on paper plates?
</P>
<P>
   Is the idea that no president's wife can be taken seriously if
she pampers her guests? Nancy Reagan would surely take justifiable
umbrage at that!
</P>
<P>
   Or is Hillary Clinton expected to get on a horse and ride out
with the boys to round up some cattle so she can ignore table
settings and write about macho things like heating soup in a can
over a sputtering outdoor campfire?
</P>
<P>
   I immediately heard all this anti-Hillary bilge from female
friends when it was announced that Simon &AMP; Schuster would publish a
book next fall overseen by the first lady, to be called ``An
Invitation to the White House.'' (Males didn't seem to care one way
or the other.) The women recoiled at the concept that Hillary
Clinton was holding forth as a hostess, but they were outraged for
vastly different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Some thought she was demeaning her own gravitas and potential
political future by donning the symbolic apron that female
politicians still fight so hard to avoid. Some thought she was
putting on airs because the Clinton White House has no class, a
refrain reflected in some Washington gossip that Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr is infinitely preferable socially. Some
thought she simply had better things to do, like saving the world.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate jab was delivered by popular New York Times
columnist Maureen Dowd, fresh from winning a Pulitzer Prize. Dowd
declared that ``when she stoops to playing wifey ... it comes
across as counterfeit.'' Because Hillary Clinton does not have a
happy home life, Dowd opined, she is creating a ``Potemkin hearth''
that is ``unsettling and unentertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Good writing. But since when does producing a book about one of
your most visible public responsibilities deteriorate into playing
wifey? White House entertaining has a political, public and
psychological purpose that is essential to presidential leadership
and the very concept of governing.
</P>
<P>
   These social events are not casual frat-house bashes. This work
is serious signal-sending, network-building and fence-mending. In
the political scheme of things, it matters that it is done, and
done well.
</P>
<P>
   Dolley Madison demonstrated that in the nation's infancy by
presiding over a vigorous social life before and after the War of
1812 with the British. Her parties have gone down in history as a
necessary complement to the dour President James Madison's grip on
official life.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, confusion between the private lives of
presidential couples and their official duties is rampant these
days in the nation's capital, for understandable reasons. Both
President and Mrs. Clinton have a problem convincing voters that
they are capable of carrying on professionally with dispassionate
skill despite the emotional chaos between them.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unrealistic to assume that Hillary Clinton _ or any
first lady for that matter _ is or should be a one-dimensional
figure. Her personality has many facets and she fills many roles,
from public policy adviser to hostess with the mostest.

 &HT;    Hawks prepare for playoffs on upswing
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ A week ago, the Hawks were sagging. Losers of four
straight. As likely to slip to the bottom of the NBA playoff pool _
or even out _ as they were to get a home-court seed for the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, their future is bright again. Thank Steve Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smitty makes the offense go,'' Mookie Blaylock said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't underestimate the significance of that statement when a
team has such a difficult time scoring. Not only did he get 20
points in his comeback game from injury Friday against Orlando, he
set up Blaylock for 30 on a lovely 12-for-20 shooting night.
</P>
<P>
   As the Hawks increasingly run their offense through Smith, it
appears all _ well, almost all _ things are possible when they are
healthy. Beset by colds and flu and injuries to Smith, Alan
Henderson and LaPhonso Ellis, who is out for the season, they have
been at least one key player short at almost every turn the past
month.
</P>
<P>
   No contender in the Eastern Conference is a stranger to such
hardship. See the Pacers (Derrick McKey), the Magic (Bo Outlaw),
the Heat (Voshon Lenard and Jamal Mashburn), the Knicks (Patrick
Ewing), the Cavaliers (Zydrunas Ilgauskas) the Pistons (Christian
Laettner). All must muddle through the loss of players.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend past shows how fragile this season is. Atlanta,
mired in sixth place, jumped two spots by beating Boston and
Orlando as the Pacers, the Pistons, the Heat, the Knicks and the
Bucks all suffered stunning setbacks. Today, the Hawks are a full
game better than Detroit, 1 1/2 up on Milwaukee, and they must
remain fourth or better to gain home-court advantage in the first
round. The two closest pursuers hold the tie-breaker edge if they
finish even with the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of this stretch run, Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens
said, is that he's getting his players back healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten some nice play out of our bench,'' he said. ``But
when you start changing roles, you create confusion. Guys have to
readjust. What I want going down the stretch is to have each of
them where he belongs and back in a routine because there's very
little turnaround time this year.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Hawks will have only two or three days between
their final regular season game and playoff opener. That they will
play teams they know very well will mitigate that circumstance, but
history shows the post-season is a different game. For recent
evidence, look to last spring's four-game ouster by Charlotte, a
team the Hawks beat six times during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Good health is not the only big plus for this team. There is the
play of Dikembe Mutombo, who has dominated inside, and Grant Long,
who has stepped in twice as a starter for Henderson and acquitted
himself well. A three-day weekend and a relatively light closing
schedule would do wonders for Smith's healing left knee and his
always balky right knee. Ty Corbin and Blaylock have had a chance
to get over their cold and flu problems.
</P>
<P>
   Add to the list of positives the recent play of second-year
forward Chris Crawford, who shot 13-for-21 in games against two
touted rookies, Boston's Paul Pierce and Orlando's rugged Matt
Harpring. The Hawks even got two useful performances from troubled
young guard Ed Gray.
</P>
<P>
   But there are trouble spots that include point guard, where
Blaylock's erratic shooting reflects a huge expenditure of energy
in every game. When Blaylock is neither active nor in rhythm, the
Hawks need a lift from Anthony Johnson. But the young player's
offense has collapsed as well. Over the last nine games, Johnson
has shot 8-for-38. This stretch coincides with the aftermath of his
on-court blow up with teammate Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Wilkens has shown so little confidence in rookie
Roshown McLeod that he left Crawford on the court until he fouled
out against Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks can work around these problems because having Smith in
the lineup means Corbin can swing between big guard and small
forward, giving help where needed. With nine games left in 17 days,
a relatively light pace in this compact season, Blaylock gets his
rest. Long will bring his energy from the bench when Henderson
returns from an injury, perhaps as early as Thursday against
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at this picture, Wilkens says, ``I'm optimistic.'' And
although he is never less than that, he may have good reason.

 &HT;    A team-by-team examination of the NFL draft
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff writer Len Pasquarelli
analyzes how each team fared in the weekend's NFL draft:
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Cardinals
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: Filled need for speed and big hole at left tackle in
first round with WR David Boston and OT L.J. Shelton, respectively,
then made solid choices throughout. Shelton won't start
immediately, but he'll anchor line for next 10 years. Impact
player: Boston will join talented wideouts Frank Sanders and Rob
Moore. Value picks: LB Johnny Rutledge (No. 2) and CB Coby
Rhinehart (No. 6a) will break in on special teams. Reach: FB Joel
Mackovicka (No. 4) is too stiff. Grade: B+.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Falcons
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: For second year in row, player they most coveted, DE
Patrick Kerney, fell right into their laps. Maybe, to twist the
adage, design is the residue of luck. Rationale for dealing No. 1
in 2000 for TE Reggie Kelly, based on belief incumbent O.J.
Santiago will leave in two years, actually was short-sighted.
Impact player: None. Value picks: SS Johndale Carty (No. 4) might
already be better than all their young safeties, and C Todd McClure
(No. 7a) is tough, but limited, athlete. Reach: FB Jeff Paulk (No.
3). Grade: C.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Ravens
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: Only came out of draft with four choices, and that's not
enough for team whose offense is being dismantled. CB Chris
McAlister (No. 1) has better mechanics than Champ Bailey, is
bigger, and will team with last year's No. 1, Duane Starks. Impact
player: McAlister. Value picks: SS Anthony Poindexter may be forced
to redshirt because of knee injury, but it was worth a
seventh-rounder just to get his rights, and WR Brandon Stokley (No.
4) is a steal. Reach: None, because they had few picks. Grade: C.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Bills
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: There are few duets better than GM John Butler and
personnel director Dwight Adams, and they added solid players all
the way through the fifth round. Despite lack of size, CB Antoine
Winfield (No. 1) plays likea 6-footer. RB Shawn Bryson (No. 3) may
be better pro than Tennessee teammate WR Peerless Price (No. 2),
who doesn't have most consistent hands. Impact player: Winfield.
Value pick: TE Bobby Collins (No. 4b) was one of draft's
fastest-rising prospects in the past month. Reach: None. Grade: B-.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina Panthers
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: Still haunted by surrendering pair of first-round
choices as compensation for the '98 signing of underachieving
veteran DE Sean Gilbert. First-year coach George Seifert has lot of
holes to fill, and five choices wasn't enough. Georgia OT Chris
Terry (No. 2a) could challenge for starting left tackle job as a
rookie, but needs bulk and experience. Impact player: None. Value
pick: Only one with chance is LB Hannibal Navies (No. 4), and he
must stay healthy, play like he did at end of '98. Reach: None.
Grade: C-.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Bears
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: No team had more choices (13) and few needed wholesale
influx as much as the Bears. Director of operations Mark Hatley did
nifty job dealing down in the first round, collecting additional
picks, and still getting player he wanted in QB Cade McNown (No.
1). DT Russell Davis (No. 2b) and OG Rex Tucker (No. 3a) are tough
guys on rise, but not everyone is sold on WR D'Wayne Bates (No.
3b). Impact player: McNown. Value picks: LB Khari Samuel (No. 5b)
and RB Jerry Azumah (No. 5c) were heists. Reach: None. Grade: B+.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Bengals
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: Give ``the Bungles'' credit for not screwing it up when
QB Akili Smith (No. 1), a player they coveted since the combine,
dropped to them. Bengals would have taken him if they had first
overall choice in draft. Landing CB Charles Fisher (No. 2) was a
must, given inability to re-sign incumbent Ashley Ambrose. Impact
players: Smith and Fisher will be starters by mid-October. Value
pick: OG Tony Coats (No. 7a) is a mammoth but developmental
blocker. Reach: Could have gotten WR Craig Yeast (No. 4) later.
Grade: C.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland Browns
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: The quality of the picks certainly doesn't match the
quantity (11), and that's a surprise given how long management
planned this draft. After signing QB Tim Couch (No. 1), the Browns
lost their heads. WR Kevin Johnson (No. 2a) and LB Rahim Abdullah
(No. 2b) both have attitude problems. CB Daylon McCutcheon (No. 3)
is small. Impact player: Couch won't have to start as rookie, but
he's the cornerstone. Value pick: SS Marquis Smith (No. 3b) and LB
Wali Rainer (No. 4). Reach: Abdullah. Grade: C-.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Cowboys
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: Owner Jerry Jones doesn't understand urgency for players
who can immediately contribute to franchise in decline. The top
choices, DE Ebenezer Ekuban (No. 1) and OT Solomon Page (No. 2),
both are formative players who need time to develop. Impact player:
None. Value pick: DE Peppi Zellner (No. 4b) is inexperienced, but
intriguing. Reach: Taking LB Dat Nguyen (No. 3), first player of
Vietnamese ancestry in NFL, was nice public relations move, but
could have gotten him a round later. Grade: D+.
</P>
<P>
   Denver Broncos
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: Except at safety and linebacker, Super Bowl champs
possess no glaring needs and weekend demonstrated they have luxury
of drafting prospects who won't be pressed into playing as rookies.
Best examples are CB Chris Watson (No. 3a), one of few big cover
players in pool but still overlooked by many teams, and DE David
Bowens (No. 5), an undersized pass-rusher. Impact player: None, but
don't need any. Value pick: OG Lennie Friedman (No. 2b) is
late-riser. Reach: WR Travis McGriff (No. 3b). Grade: A-.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit Lions
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: Coach Bobby Ross considered taking OT Aaron Gibson with
eighth overall pick, opted for LB Chris Claiborne (No. 1a), then
dealt for another choice late in first round to get Gibson, who was
still on the board. That gave him two of the 19 blue-chippers in
this draft. Masterful work, indeed. Only question is whether
Claiborne can play outside. Impact player: Gibson will start at
right tackle and maul people. Value pick: No way RB Sedrick Irvin
(No. 4) should have lasted that long. Reach: None. Grade: A.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay Packers
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: Wanted to get bigger at cornerback and did just that
with Antwan Edwards (No. 1) and Mike McKenzie (No. 3a). A third
corner, Fred Vinson (No. 2), adds some speed. Ron Wolf actually
thought about moving up for Edwards but surprisingly got him at
25th spot. DT Cletidus Hunt (No. 3b) is interesting project. Impact
player: Edwards will get chance to start as rookie. Value picks:
Pair of fifth-rounders, RB DeMond Parker and C Craig Heimburger,
were big-time bonuses. Reach: QB Aaron Brooks (No. 4a). Grade: B-.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis Colts
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: GM Bill Polian revels in doing the unexpected and trying
to stick it to so-called experts. But if RB Edgerrin James (No. 1)
falters, no one will let him forget he passed on RB Ricky Williams.
LB Mike Peterson (No. 2) could start right now, and OG Brandon
Burlsworth (No. 3) also could be in lineup by opening day. Impact
player: James seems to be bigger version of the departed Marshall
Faulk. Value pick: DE Brad Scioli (No. 5) will be situational
pass-rusher as rookie. Reach: None. Grade: B.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville Jaguars
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: After ignoring the need for a pure cover corner for
three years, Jags finally got potential starter in CB Fernando
Bryant (No. 1). After that, Tom Couglin settled into the kind of
safe, workmanlike players he prefers. Don't underestimate chances
of Georgia DT Emarlos Leroy (No. 6) to make roster as inside
run-stopper. Impact player: Bryant. Value pick: CB Dee Moronkola
(No. 7a) was second in nation in kickoff returns last year and can
play as ``nickel'' corner. Reach: CB Jason Craft (No. 5) is
undersized. Grade: C+.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Chiefs
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: Left tackle spot has been problem area for Chiefs, and
John Tait (No. 1), premier pass-blocker in draft, should improve
psyche of QB Elvis Grbac. After choice of Tait and RB Mike Cloud
(No. 2), began rolling dice on too many prospects who might turn
out to be suspects. Impact player: Tait could start in '98. Value
pick: Cloud. Reaches: LB Gary Stills (No. 3a) slipped on almost
every team's board because of knee problems. FS Larry Atkins (No.
3b) and WR Larry Parker (No. 4) had past injuries. Grade: C.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Dolphins
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: Still determined to build a running game, Jimmy Johnson
took three backs with his eight choices and hopes to hit on one of
them. Actually, he could strike gold with all three: James Johnson
(No. 2a), Rob Konrad (No. 2b) and Cecil Collins (No. 5a). Impact
player: Konrad is miscast as fullback, actually is big running back
with receiving skill. Value pick: If Collins can stay out of
trouble, and that's a big ``if,'' he will be the steal of this
decade. Reach: P Brent Bartholomew (No. 6) is free agent caliber.
Grade: C-.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Vikings
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: With one of league's best, but most unheralded scouting
staffs, Vikes annually turn in a great job by doing more with less.
This year they had two No. 1 picks and did less than ever with
them. In desperate need of a starting cornerback, Green took QB
Daunte Culpepper (No. 1) instead. Unless he can cover someone, he
won't start until 2001. Impact player: None. Value picks: TE Jim
Kleinsasser (No. 2) and CB Kenny Wright (No. 4a). Reach: DE
Dimitrius Underwood (No. 1b) didn't play a down in '98. Grade: F.
</P>
<P>
   New England Patriots
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: Ended up taking talented underachievers. Got hoodwinked
into believing Giants would take C Damien Woody (No. 1a), a player
New York wasn't even considering, and traded up to get him when he
would have fallen to them. While choice of LB Andy Katenmoyer (No.
1b) was sound, they already have terrific MLB in Ted Johnson.
Impact player: Woody will start. Value pick: SS Tony George (No. 3)
is going to be a solid contributor. Reach: QB Michael Bishop (No.
7a) is free agent type. Grade: F.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans Saints
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: One month after vowing to surrender his entire draft for
RB Ricky Williams (No. 1), coach Mike Ditka did just that. But if
Ditka thinks the Heisman winner is the a guy who can get him to the
playoffs, he must not be looking at the rest of his sorry roster.
Ditka can't get the ball to Williams the promised 30 times per game
if the Saints trail all the time. Plus if Williams' demands are as
steep as his agent claims they will be, Ditka will go ballistic.
Impact player: Williams. Value pick: None. Reach: None. Grade: C+.
</P>
<P>
   New York Giants
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: Including opening choice of OT Luke Pettigout (No. 1),
the club reached for players it could have gotten later. Pettigout
is legit first-rounder, but Giants could have dealt back to get
him. Indicative of approach was selection of a pair of running
backs, Joe Montgomery (No. 2) and Sean Bennett (No. 4), who didn't
start in '98. Impact player: If Pettigout can move to guard, he
might start. Value pick: None. Reach: Bennett was Division II star,
transferred to Northwestern and had 160 yards in '98. Grade: F.
</P>
<P>
   New York Jets
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: Made final installment, first-round pick, on
compensation package to Patriots for signing coach Bill Parcells,
so didn't have choice until 57th pick. Parcells has zero guards
with regular-season experience, so spent three of seven selection
on players at the position. It's not likely any of them will start
as rookie, although Randy Thomas (No. 2) is a mauler. Impact
player: None. Value pick: DT Jason Wiltz (No. 4) is gigantic
run-stopper, must get motivated. Reach: DE J.J. Syvrud (No. 7) free
agent type. Grade: D+.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland Raiders
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: Might look at OT Matt Stinchcomb (No. 1) as guard first,
and selection of former Georgia star gives them future standout on
shaky line. After taking Stinchcomb, they were all over the board
and might as well have been throwing darts. DE Tony Bryant (No. 2)
was much-hyped underachiever during his senior season at FSU.
Impact player: Stinchcomb. Value pick: LB Eric Barton (No. 5a) and
DE Rod Coleman (No. 5b) should be solid down the line. Reach: WR
Dameane Douglas (No. 4) lacks run after catch. Grade: C-.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia Eagles
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: Fans wanted RB Ricky Williams, but credit director of
operations Tom Modrak for realizing you build around a quarterback.
Only problem is, did they take right one? QB Donovan McNabb (No. 1)
didn't play in very sophisticated passing offense. Choices of LB
Barry Gardner (No. 2) and OG Doug Brzezinski (No. 3) were terrific.
Impact players: McNabb and Gardner. Value picks: FS Damon Moore
(No. 4b) and WR Na Brown (No. 4c) are middle-round steals. Reach:
OT John Welbourn (No. 4a) was a bit too high. Grade: B+.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh Steelers
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: As always, solid if unspectacular bounty by one of NFL's
best scouting staffs. That said, free agency defections are
starting to catch up to Steelers, who had to let a few great
prospects pass by to fill huge hole with WR Troy Edwards (No. 1).
FS Scott Shields (No. 2a) is versatile, and maybe team can get
something out of overrated tackle Kris Farris (No. 3b). Impact
player: Edwards. Value pick: LB Joey Porter (No. 3a) is Steelers
kind of edge defender. Reach: They didn't need RB Amos Zeroue (No.
3c). Grade: B-.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Rams
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: Week that started with acquisition of RB Marshall Faulk
in trade continued to be productive for Rams. Since they can't
count on oft-injured WR Isaac Bruce, choice of WR Torry Holt (No.
1) was a terrific one, even if they passed on some super players.
CB Dre Bly (No. 2) gives team ball-hawking ``nickel'' cover man.
Impact player: Holt. Value picks: QB Joe Germaine (No. 4) will be
solid backup in NFL, and OG Cameron Spikes (No. 5) athletic in-line
player. FS Rich Coady (No. 3a) late-riser. Reach: None. Grade: B.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego Chargers
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: Getting to be a trademark for Bobby Beathard, taking
guys from small schools who don't pan out. This year it included
prospects from South Dakota State, McNeese State and North Alabama.
The guy from the big-name school, FB Jermaine Fazande of Oklahoma,
wasn't even on the draft boards of most teams. Best pick may have
been SS Jason Perry (No. 4), who will be tried at corner. Impact
player: None. Value pick: TE Steve Heiden (No. 3) has great work
ethic. Reach: Fazande and DE Adrian Dingle (No. 5). Grade: D.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco 49ers
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: In his return to the NFL, team president Bill Walsh
didn't get the quarterback he wanted but at least found some
prospects to bolster a dismantled defense. DT Reggie McGrew (No. 1)
has short arms but nice potential, and DE Chike Okeafor (No. 3)
provides some pass-rush speed. Impact player: McGrew. Value picks:
CB Anthony Parker (No. 4a) and FS Pierson Prioleau (No. 4b) both
can run and cover, and FB Terry Jackson (No. 5) is a great special
teams performer. Reach: WR Tai Streets (No. 6) has a torn Achilles.
Grade: C-.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Seahawks
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: New coach Mike Holmgren gave personnel man Randy Mueller
more clout in the draft room, and results were mixed. The Seahawks
twice traded down in the first round and missed all the
blue-chippers, but still got emerging DE Lamar King (No. 1).
Landing QB Brock Huard (No. 3), who threw the ball as well as
anyone at the combine, was grand theft. Impact player: King. Value
pick: Georgia DE Antonio Cochran (No. 4) was a player who came on
late. Reach: OT Floyd Wedderburn (No. 5a) has knee problems. Grade:
B-.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay Buccaneers
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: The streak of sagacious selections by GM Rich McKay and
coach Tony Dungy continued for another year. The Bucs succeed by
drafting productive players and don't worry so much about fitting
molds. DT Anthony McFarland (No. 1) could be super when lined up
next to Warren Sapp. And Dungy loves QB Shaun King (No. 2). Impact
player: McFarland and PK Martin Gramatica (No. 3). Value picks: No
way two seventh-rounders, RB Autry Denson and WR Darnell McDonald,
should have been available. Reach: None. Grade: B.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Titans
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: The war room battles between coach Jeff Fisher and GM
Floyd Reese became a moot point when DE Jevon Kearse (No. 1)
unexpectedly fell to the Titans. He'll provide the pass rush
Tennessee has lacked. DT John Thornton (No. 2) is an underachiever
who could become a player, if he finds some work ethic. Impact
player: Kearse, who is a defensive rookie of the year candidate.
Value picks: OG Zach Piller (No. 3) and QB Kevin Daft (No. 5).
Reach: WR Darran Hall (No. 6) is swift but has terrible hands.
Grade: C+.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Redskins
</P>
<P>
   Skinny: General manager Charley Casserly could be a lame duck if
the team is sold, so give him credit for putting the good of the
franchise in front of his own good. Moving down to collect picks
from New Orleans didn't cost him a shot at the second-best guy in
the draft, CB Champ Bailey (No. 1). Second-round OT Jon Jansen
could start quickly on a very thin line. Impact player: Bailey.
Value picks: LB Nate Stimson (No. 4) shot up the charts since
January, and PK Jeff Hall (No. 6) is very good. Reach: OT Derek
Smith (No. 5b). Grade: B.

THE CAR SEAT WARS: THEY'RE BULKY, BEWILDERING AND A BASIC FACT OF
LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CAR SEAT-FACTS and CAR SEAT-BEST) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The child car seat: at one point or another, the bane of every
parent's existence. Bulky, inconvenient, stinky, the car seat is
nonetheless an essential accouterment of child-rearing. After all,
it saves lives.
</P>
<P>
   But the road to car-seat satisfaction is no easy journey. In
fact, some families never achieve the spiritual plane of car-seat
contentment: wherein a child happily remains in the seat and does
not spill, goober or otherwise despoil the fabric covering the
seat; wherein an adult can properly install the seat without
incurring some minor injury or embarrassment; wherein said seat
does not slide from one end of the vehicle's back seat to the other
during a short trip to the grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be one of my great sources of humor,'' notes Brenda
Hantsche of the car-seat phenomenon. An Arlington, Texas, mother of
six, Hantsche remembers the car seat her little brother rode in
during the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a little metal frame with a cotton piece of fabric
for the seat. And all it did was hook onto the back of the front
seat,'' Hantsche says. ``However, you didn't need an engineering
degree to figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's car seats are far more complex than those primitive
models. They come with 30-page instruction booklets containing
diagrams pointing to lap-belt guides, head-pad straps, adjuster
buttons, release handles, recline bars, tethers, yokes, side slots,
chest-clip harnesses, etc., etc.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one for every different age and every different
weight,'' complains Loraine Coleman, mom of 3-year-old Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a terrible pain,'' admits Rick Paschall, dad to
3-year-old Conner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They smell up your car,'' claims Julie Wende, 6-year-old
Joey's mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along with safety,'' Hantsche adds, ``comes a lot of
frustration and confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Tabitha Williams is pregnant with her first child and, today,
fighting her inaugural battle with a child car seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you do this?'' she asks, struggling to attach a metal
clasp to a blue Buick Park Avenue seat belt. ``Is it that way?''
</P>
<P>
   As part of her prenatal care at John Peter Smith Hospital in
Fort Worth, Williams is attending a 1 1/2-hour class on car-seat
safety. It is her turn to demonstrate proper installation of a car
seat using the demo model at the front of the classroom. It is not
going smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Williams tries for a few more seconds before instructor Kathy
Owens jumps in and fights the stubborn clasp. Finally, it binds the
lap and shoulder belts properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an easy thing to use,'' Owens admits of the small
metal gadget called a locking clip.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's this hard,'' Williams says, ``I guarantee I won't go
through all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon completing the $7 class, Williams and the other women here
will receive a voucher. After delivering their babies, the women
will turn in their vouchers for a free car seat.
</P>
<P>
   The class consists of a 15-minute video, the hands-on experience
and a short explanation from Owens, the nurse educator. All of it
directly stresses the importance, and indirectly obviates the
headache, of the car seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have an infant backward-facing in the car seat,''
explains harried mom Sandy Raitt. ``But if they reach 20 pounds and
a year, you can have them forward-facing. The problem is, when they
hit 20 pounds before a year, you're supposed to keep them
backward-facing, but they've grown out of the infant seat. So they
make the kind (of car seat) that swivels back and forth. But it's
the hugest thing. If you want to sit in the back seat with them,
you have to smush in. It's a big pain in the butt. ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Petite Julia Decker, mother of four, drives a Ford Explorer, but
placing the car seat in the middle of the back seat blocked her
view of the road, so she moved the car seat directly behind her.
But now when her son asks for his juice, she has to swivel her head
and arm ``Exorcist''-style to reach back to him.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, because Decker transports clients for her work, she is
constantly taking the car seat out and putting it back in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear, if they could just make an inflatable one,'' she
fantasizes, ``where you could just push a button and it inflates
and then push it again and it deflates. It would be the easiest
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As complicated as car seats are for parents, children seem to
have mastered their great mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wants to get out, he's out,'' says Charitta
Bryant-Griffin, mom of 2-year-old Charles.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's only 2,'' notes Bobbie Hickman, Antia Hickman's
grandmother. ``But I'll turn on a spiritual tape and be driving
down the freeway, and I'll look back, and she's standing up
dancing. How she unfastens it, I'll never know. It's hard for
``me'' to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents have learned the hard way how not to place a child
in a car seat. There was the time Lyrtrina Jenkins was leaning over
her baby's car seat and slipped on the car's vinyl upholstery,
sending her face-first into the back seat. ``My mom found that very
hilarious,'' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Or the time Hantsche, trying to extract her infant's car seat
from the stroller, smashed her finger so hard she swears she saw
``stars and clouds with little bluebirds flying around them.''
</P>
<P>
   As seemingly innocent as they are, car seats have strained
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband watched everything and read everything about safety
and car seats, and he made us take two back (to the store) before
he got one he felt was safe enough,'' Loraine Coleman says. ``It
was ridiculous. It had to be just so-so.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Bruckner's 3-year-old refuses to sit in her car seat,
except when two other toddler friends ride in the car. Then, all
three clamor for the seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We draw straws every time we get in the car,'' Bruckner notes.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carithers has the same problem with his 2-year-old
daughter, Sadie, and his girlfriend's 2-year-old. ``They fight over
which car seat is the best,'' he says, sighing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot call it a car seat or they will not sit in it,''
stresses Kathy Steinbrenner, the mom of 5-year-old twins. ``You
have to call it a booster seat or some special name. Car seats are
for babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Car seats and food seem to be in a category all their own.
Jodette Neely's car has built-in car seats for kids. Problem is,
they're impossible to clean. ``Once you get a cookie stuck in 'em,
you can't get it out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They can become a health hazard,'' says Nancy Mackey, whose
4-year-old daughter, Jordan, ``has a cafeteria'' under her car
seat. ``If you don't take (the car seat) out of the car for a
couple months and then you take it out for somebody to sit there,
and there's all that gunk that collects underneath them, old M&AMP;Ms
and crackers that are halfway eaten ... ''
</P>
<P>
   'Nuff said.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to avoid the inconvenience of the car seat? Walk.
Otherwise, suck it up, belt it down and, most importantly, drive
safely.

 &HT;    Playful Turner addresses audience as broadcaster convention
opens
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS, Nev. _ Only Ted Turner would risk opening an address
to one of the country's most powerful industries like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure I'm probably the only TV station owner who applied
for membership in your group and was turned down.''
</P>
<P>
   And only Turner could get laughs instead of boos for such a
line.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, tens of thousands of broadcasters packed a cavernous
hall Monday to hear Turner poke fun at himself and their trade
group, the National Association of Broadcasters. It represents most
of the radio and TV stations in the country, including all in metro
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The NAB is holding its annual convention here through Wednesday
and invited Turner to come for the first time. He wasn't welcome
when he owned just his cable programming giant Turner Broadcasting
System.
</P>
<P>
   But now Turner has sold his company to and is vice chairman of
Time Warner, one of the largest producers of television programming
and owner of the fledgling WB network.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, though, didn't want to talk much about his new role.
Instead, like a general reminiscing about past battles, he focused
on earlier run-ins with the NAB in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became a member of the NAB when I bought Channel 17,'' said
Turner. ``But then the NAB opposed me turning Channel 17 into the
SuperStation, a cable network _ so I quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want you to take my $5,000 in membership fees and use
it to beat me over the head,'' said Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later I re-applied and _ can you believe it? _ you turned me
down. Now that must have been a first.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner said he missed those old days, when there were just three
big networks and a handful of independent stations and cable
channels. Now, Turner lamented, there is too much competition, too
many new channels coming with the advent of digital television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want all of you to raise your hands right now and agree with
me not to put any more channels on the air,'' said Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, if there's anyone here from the FCC (Federal
Communications Commission), please don't give out any more
licenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many raised their hands, but the audience did give Turner a
big laugh and standing ovation. And that seemed just fine with
Turner, who stepped down from the podium smiling broadly.

 &HT;    Hero fireman, rescued crane operator treated to Disney parade
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ This had all the makings of a family vacation
photo.
</P>
<P>
   Three kids, husband and wife, flanked by Mickey and Minnie
Mouse. A spring weekday morning, the other coast away from
Woodland, Ala., and about 20 degrees hotter.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not just another trip to Disneyland. As members of
the Ivers Sims family gathered on Main Street USA, their picture
was taken by 20 or so cameras, both still and video. Their visit
included a parade, a firetruck rolling down the street to a slow,
whining siren and a bass drum, which set the beat to a marching
band rendition of the Raiders of the Lost Ark theme. They were
showered in a blizzard of red, white and blue confetti.
</P>
<P>
   All this just a week after the Sims family was very nearly
shattered, when Ivers Sims, a construction worker, clung to a crane
200 feet above a burning Atlanta mill, waiting for the daring
helicopter rescue and ride on a rope with firefighter Matt Moseley.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Sims and Moseley sat side-by-side atop the firetruck
during the cavalcade down Main Street, smiling and waving as they
were greeted like heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not often you get a happy ending like this,'' said
Moseley, whose larger-than-life rescue of Sims was shown on live
television in Atlanta and on CNN. ``A fairy-tale ending in a
fairy-tale land.''
</P>
<P>
   But this one was too real for Hollywood, a raw slice of real
life next to the Super Bowl winners who smile at the TV cameras and
say ``I'm goin' to Disneyland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like a dream, only in a while reality hits you,''
Ivers Sims said. ``What brought me here was a real experience. I
wish I could have been here under different circumstances. But I'm
glad to be here to talk about living.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariland Sims had told her husband when they married four years
ago, that two places she always wanted to go were Disneyland and to
see the Statue of Liberty. She had no idea it would take nearing
losing her husband _ and an invitation from the folks at Disney _
to bring that dream true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's turned out to be wonderful,'' said Marilind Sims,
standing with her three children, Chantrius, David and Larry, all
in their Sunday best. ``Sometimes it takes bad things to happen to
get good things.''
</P>
<P>
   A week earlier, she had been trapped in those ever-lasting
moments as her husband hung on for dear life on her television
screen. She circled her sister's house from room-to-room, crying
and praying.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley had been a firefighter for eight years, but never really
got this close to the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lets you know someone higher than us is taking care of
us,'' Moseley said. ``I've been told by one of the crane engineers,
he couldn't give us a reason that crane was still standing. For all
intents and purposes it should have been down. So somebody else was
there holding that crane up until we could get him off.''
</P>
<P>
   Moseley's mother, Sharon Hembree, was at Disneyland on Monday,
all the way from College Park, Ga., to honor her son and only
child.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredible,'' Hembree said. ``I still can't believe it
was him up there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a belated birthday celebration of sorts for Hembree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Thursday was my birthday,'' she said. ``Next year for my
birthday, just a card please.''

 &HT;    McCain calls for 'whatever force necessary' in Kosovo
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the first U.S. senators to advocate ground
troops in Kosovo, hawk John McCain (R-Ariz.) swooped into Georgia
Monday and called for the immediate mobilization of U.S.
infantrymen.
</P>
<P>
   The former Vietnam War prisoner of war said timidity among NATO
political leaders has prevented Gen. Wesley Clark, commander of
allied forces, from effectively directing military strikes in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Avoiding casualties_theirs and ours_is not our primary
objective. Winning is. The sooner the better,'' McCain told about
200 people at the Cobb Galleria Centre during a luncheon meeting of
the Georgia Public Policy Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To that end, we should commence today to mobilize infantry and
armor divisions for a possible _ I emphasize possible _ ground war
in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has criticized President Clinton for limiting NATO
airstrikes and sidestepping the use of ground forces. A candidate
for the GOP's 2000 presidential nomination, McCain suggested
Congress this week should debate and vote on a resolution
authorizing Clinton to use ``whatever force necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said it was time for Congress and the president to flex
the muscle of a superpower against Yugoslavia President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best course for us, NATO, Kosovo, Russia _ and even Serbia
_ is to begin fighting this war as if it were a war ... instead of
some strange interlude between peace initiatives,'' said McCain,
who serves on the Senate Armed Service Committee.

 &HT;    Atlanta Falcons draft analysis
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Drafting 30th makes it very tough to wow the world,
but if the current criteria for grading the annual NFL draft
involves how teams address needs, it was an average draft for the
Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   There is room to disagree with coach Dan Reeves' statement a
month ago that draft priorities should be the secondary, defensive
line, tight end and fullback. Many thought the Falcons needed to
add a speedy wide receiver since waiving Tony Martin in February,
and that didn't happen with Chris Calloway, the free agent receiver
they acquired. Calloway is not a burner.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons did add one speed receiver in 5-foot-9, 178-pound
Rondel Menendez. But he came in the seventh round, and played
against few, if any, future NFL defensive backs at Eastern
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia defensive end Patrick Kerney, the first-round pick, was
a good get. With a great burst, he figures to apply instant
pressure on opposing quarterbacks and likely will be a backup to
right end Chuck Smith.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it was slim pickings.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta traded next year's first-round pick to Baltimore to use
the Raven's 12th pick of the second round to select Mississippi
State tight end Reggie Kelly. Arizona fullback Jeff Paulk was taken
in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Both satisfied some of Reeves' stated draft goals, but it's
questionable whether those picks will serve the team better than
getting a more talented speed receiver than Menendez or the
moderately quick and super-thin (6-feet, 162 pounds) Eugene Baker
in the fifth round.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves obviously thinks he did the right thing. He wanted a
tight end to complement starter O.J. Santiago in the two-tight end
set and a fullback to spell Bob Christian, whose season ended Dec.
13 with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Both are blockers.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly caught 12 passes last year, Paulk two in his entire
college career.
</P>
<P>
   Paulk's performance in Arizona State's game against USC sold the
Falcons on that pick. He often got the better of Trojans linebacker
Chris Claiborne, whom the Lions drafted No. 9 overall.
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta also uses its fullback as a receiver, and Paulk
hasn't shown those skills. He's a very good as a straight-line
blocker, but sometimes struggles in pass protection. He's not
agile.
</P>
<P>
   And Reeves said it is unclear if Kelly can be utilized as a
motion tight end, or H-back, like Brian Kozlowski last year.
</P>
<P>
   The two best picks on paper are Kerney and Utah State safety
Johndale Carty, a fourth-round pick, who is a terrific hitter with
limited instincts who projects to strong safety.
</P>
<P>
   Had he not had a poor senior season when his team changed
defensive schemes, he might have ended up a second-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   Baker consistently got open at Kent, catching a whopping 103
passes as a junior. But it's questionable whether he will have the
strength to beat a jam at the line or whether his 4.54-second speed
in the 40-yard dash will enable him to separate from NFL defensive
backs.
</P>
<P>
   There are possibilities for the Falcons other picks -- Kansas
State middle linebacker Jeff Kelly (6th), Iowa safety Eric Thigpen
(6th) and LSU center Todd McClure (7th). But none are viewed as
impact-type players.
</P>
<P>
   But as always with the NFL draft, only time will tell.
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: The Falcons signed nine undrafted college players Monday,
including former Florida State linebacker Lamont Green, and former
Texas tackle Octavious Bishop, who blocked for Heisman Trophy
winner Ricky Williams. The others were UCLA linebacker Brendon
Ayanbadejo, Charleston Southern offensive tackle John Breeden,
Kansas State punter James Garcia, California cornerback Derrick
Gardner, Ohio University Steve Hoofkin, Colorado guard Ben Nichols,
and Utah State guard Kenny Watts.

CRASH-TEST FAVORITES
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies CAR SEAT WARS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consumer Reports recently crash-tested 28 child car seats to
come up with a list of favorites.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine of Consumers' Union asked an outside lab to perform
crash tests similar to the government's, strapping dummies of
various sizes into seats placed on a ring that was run through a
simulated head-on collision.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer researchers also judged how easy each seat was to use
and whether it could be installed correctly in vehicles with
different safety-seat systems and seat configurations.
</P>
<P>
   Top choices from their January 1999 report include:
</P>
<P>
   Infant seats: These are placed in a rear-facing position and are
for babies up to 20-22 pounds. They also double as infant carriers.
The top pick, the Graco 7497 LiteRider All-Terrain Travel System,
$160, comes with a stroller. Other top performers include the
Evenflo on My Way 207, $55, Century SmartFit Plus 4529, $60, and
Kolcraft Secura 43834, $60.
</P>
<P>
   Convertible seats: These work two ways _ rear-facing for babies
weighing up to 22 pounds and forward-facing for toddlers up to 40
pounds. Top-rated models include the Century 1000 STE Classic 4161,
$50, the Century 2000 STE Classic 4261, $60, and the Century 3000
Room-to-Grow Classic 4331, $70.
</P>
<P>
   Booster seats: These raise a child who weighs 30 to 60 pounds
high enough so he or she can use the vehicle's safety belt.
Top-rated picks: the Fisher-Price Safe Embrace 79750, $60, the
Evenflo Right Fit 245, $25 _ a CR ``Best Buy'' _ and the Kolcraft
Prodigy 53000, $50.
</P>
<P>
   Toddler/booster seats: These are used with a harness to secure
toddlers who weigh at least 20 to 30 pounds and without one when
the child weighs 40 pounds and can use the vehicle's seat belt.
Top-rated picks: the Cosco High Back Booster 02-442, $40, and the
Century Next Step 4920, $100.

   SERGIYEV POSAD, Russia _ Relations between the United states and
Russia may have reached their lowest point since the fall of the
Berlin Wall, but remarkably, that has not stopped a US-funded
program to dismantle the decaying, but still deadly, nuclear
arsenal of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   At a secret defense factory in this industrial town north of
Moscow, Russian submarine-launched ballistic missiles, which were
once aimed at U.S. cities, are being disarmed and dismantled _ with
American equipment and funding.
</P>
<P>
   A nearby training center for Russia's strategic rocket forces
uses techniques and equipment supplied by US specialists to weed
out Russians unfit to work with Moscow's nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Moscow wages a war of words with Washington over the
conflict in the Balkans, more than $1 billion in US-funded projects
to reduce the threat posed by Russia's weapons of mass destruction
have continued almost unabated.
</P>
<P>
   The hardiness of these projects, commonly referred to as the
``Nunn-Lugar'' program after its Congressional sponsors, former
Senator Sam Nunn and Senator Richard Lugar, provides a measure of
geopolitical comfort despite a chill in US-Russian relations not
seen since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The staying power of these joint projects despite hard times in
the relationship even suggests a model for how the West could have
better used the billions of dollars it spent to support Russia's
sporadic, and so far largely unsucessful, attempts at economic
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians see real results from Nunn-Lugar money,'' said
Pavel Felgenhauer, defense analyst for the Moscow daily Segodnya.
``Unlike other aid, where all of the money was spent and nothing
changed, with Nunn-Lugar money concrete things did happen. So the
Russians want to keep these programs, despite their suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Russian politicians, and many ordinary citizens, are upset at
the bombardment of a fellow Slavic, Orthodox Christian nation by
NATO, an alliance that until a decade ago was the Cold War
arch-enemy of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has consistently portrayed the United States as the
aggressor in the Balkan conflict, and Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, whom the West accuses of atrocities against ethnic
Albanians, as the victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton hopes to win, he hopes Milosevic will capitulate,
give up the whole of Yugoslavia, make it America's protectorate. We
will not allow this. This is a strategic place, the Balkans,''
President Boris N. Yeltsin said Monday to a meeting of Russian
editors and publishers. ``We simply cannot ditch Milosevic. We want
to embrace him as tight as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments have led to cancellation or postponement of
dozens of joint initiatives between Russia and NATO because, in the
words of one senior Russian commander, Gen. Leonid Ivashov, ``they
are no longer appropriate at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   But across Russia, a number of Nunn-Lugar programs _ which allow
Americans access to highly sensitive and until recently,
top-secret, technology _ are still under way.
</P>
<P>
   They include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Construction of a new storage site in the Ural Mountains to
keep 6,000 bombs' worth of nuclear material out of the wrong hands;
</P>
<P>
   _ A laboratory that will make it easier to keep track of
Russia's 42,000 metric tons of chemical weapons, a stockpile
capable of destroying all life on Earth many times over;
</P>
<P>
   _ Equipment and funding to help destroy ballistic missiles,
missile launchers, strategic bombers and nuclear submarines under
the 1991 Start I arms reduction treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In the first days after NATO began its airstrikes, Russia asked
that a planned review session of the program in Moscow be
postponed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But nothing else has been canceled,'' said an American
official close to the project. ``This is an incredibly tense and
difficult time for us, and there are things to work out on both
sides. They had to ask themselves a few questions. But we're moving
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nunn-Lugar program was initially created when the Soviet
Union collapsed and it became clear the successor states did not
have the resources to eliminate the cold war arsenal. Since 1991,
more than $2 billion in US funds have gone toward eliminating 3,800
nuclear weapons in Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Belarus _ the entire
nuclear arsenals of those countries _ plus reducing Russia's
arsenal by 96 submarine missile launchers, 50 missile silos, 273
strategic ballistic missiles and 30 bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Under agreements already reached, an additional 711 missiles and
many more submarine missile launch tubes will be eliminated. Other
programs, such as improving security at 50 nuclear weapons sites,
training personnel, and safeguarding transport and storage of
fissile materials _ are aimed at preventing the export of weapons
of mass destruction from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Russian military had a difficult time getting used
to the idea that Americans would pay to dismantle Russian weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first there was a big psychological problem,'' said Igor
Safranchuk of the Center for Policy Studies, a Moscow think tank
that monitors strategic arms control issues. ``Russian scientists
didn't believe that Americans would help. But when equipment and
money started coming, the mood changed. There was a sense of
humbled national pride, that Americans were financing disarmanent
by Russia, but it passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Commented the US official: ``It took time to build trust, to get
on that base where you would have been shot dead a few years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   US and Russian observers acknowledge that the Nunn-Lugar
programs have only made a dent in Russia's legacy of the nuclear
arms race. But sources on both sides call the program a success.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as February, Gen. Igor Valynkin, who heads Russia's
department for nuclear safety, praised the US aid, which he said
included special containers for transporting Russian warheads,
computers for keeping tabs on atomic weapons, emergency kits, and
screening equipment such as polygraphs for the training center in
Sergiyev Posad.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the computers (provided by the US) have been certififed by
Russian specialists,'' Valynkin commented. ``They have no bugs or
any other hidden devices to obtain secret information.''
</P>
<P>
   Valynkin's remarks point to another success of the Nunn-Lugar
program. While the officials in charge of economic reform in
Yeltsin's governments have almost all been young economists who
professed pro-Western views, the same could not be said about the
military officials and defense factory directors the US has dealt
with under Nunn-Lugar programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the International Monetary Fund gave Russia credits, they
would say, `now, restructure the economy','' said Safronchuk.
``Nunn-Lugar didn't work like that. They would say, `build this
facility' or `destroy these missiles.' And when the work was done,
then the Russians would get their money.''
</P>
<P>
   The program has also established direct contact with Russian
companies, said Russian and US sources, providing jobs and business
at a time when most factories are at a standstill. This, too, is a
reason why Nunn-Lugar has continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should Russia refuse hundreds of millions of dollars? That
would be foolish,'' said Alexander Pikayev, an arms control analyst
at the Carnegie Moscow Center. ``Because Russia receives American
money and technology, the US in return receives more transparency
of the Russian nuclear infrastructure, and maintaining this is very
important for the US.''

 &HT;    AID WORKERS DEAD AFTER TRUCK RUNS OFF DANGEROUS ALBANIA ROAD,
OVER CLIFF
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-REFUGEES-0420; KOSOVO-TROOPS-0420.
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and BOB DEANS

<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ Former advertising executive David McCall and
his wife, Penny were killed near here Sunday when the truck they
were riding in slid off the treacherous road that links the
Albanian capital to the refugee camps at this town on the Kosovo
border.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, 71, was a director of the Washington, D.C.-based
humanitarian aid group, Refugees International. He and his wife,
57, were on a mission to assess the needs of the growing refugee
population in Albania, where more than 340,000 ethnic Albanians
have sought refuge from repressive activities in the Serbian
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Also killed in the accident were Refugees International's
European Representative, Yvette Pierpaoli, and the group's Albanian
driver, whose name was not provided by the refugee group.
</P>
<P>
   ``David and Penny McCall and Yvette Pierpaoli died as they had
lived: on a mission to help people in need,'' wrote U.S. diplomat
Richard Holbrooke, chairman of the Refugees International board.
``Their generosity and courage will not be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall, a former New York advertising executive, had been tapped
to replace Holbrooke -- special White House envoy for the Balkans
and President Clinton's nominee as U.S. Ambassador to the United
Nations -- as chairman of Refugees International.
</P>
<P>
   The sport-utility vehicle the four victims were riding in slid
off the edge of a winding mountain road two thirds of the way from
Tirana to Kukes on Sunday, said Shep Lowman, vice president for
policy for Refugees International.
</P>
<P>
   The mountain road they were on is a treacherous proposition. Its
hairpin curves and steep grades present countless opportunities for
disaster. Sheer cliffs drop off the road with no barriers either to
warn the unsuspecting driver or to halt and deflect a vehicle that
fails to negotiate a turn.
</P>
<P>
   These days it is especially hazardous, with trucks carrying
humanitarian aid, tractors hauling refugees down the mountains, and
more behemoth buses than normal plying the route to carry Kosovar
refugees to the southern part of Albania. There scarcely is room to
pass them.
</P>
<P>
   Lowman, who was recently on the road, said the vehicle plunged
roughly 400 yards down a mud-slicked ravine in a pouring rain.
</P>
<P>
   The organization did not officially confirm the deaths until
after the bodies were recovered by helicopter on Monday, said
Lowman.

 &HT;    WHITE HOUSE SEEKS $6 BILLION FOR BALKAN AIR WAR
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton asked Congress on Monday for
$6.05 billion in emergency money to pay for the air war in the
Balkans and humanitarian assistance to 750,000 refugees forced out
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The request includes $5.12 billion to replace cruise missiles
and other ordnance and to continue the air war until Oct. 1, the
start of the next fiscal year. However, administration officials
said that does not include potential costs of sending ground
troops, either for a military offensive or for peacekeeping
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the spending package would go for housing, food and
other aid to refugees. Assistant Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
announced that $150 million of that would be aimed at shoring up
neighboring nations, such as Albania and Macedonia, that have been
staggering under the flood of ethnic Albanians fleeing Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that the Congress will act on this,'' Clinton said at
the White House. ``The need for this funding is urgent, immediate,
clearly in the national interest. There are literally lives hanging
in the balance. And so I hope in the spirit of genuine
bipartisanship, the Congress will move the package right away.''
</P>
<P>
   The supplemental spending bill would give Congress its first
formal vote on the 27-day old conflict, which has involved more
than 450 U.S. warplanes at a cost of more than $1 billion. The
United States is providing about 25 percent of the humanitarian aid
for the Kosovo refugees and paying about 60 percent of the cost of
the NATO air war.
</P>
<P>
   However, the spending proposal is not expected to provide a
platform for Congress to debate the U.S. involvement in Yugoslavia.
There have been widespread congressional complaints about the lack
of White House preparation for the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Republican leaders in Congress are criticizing the
proposal for not seeking more money for the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., called the request
``short-sighted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration has been downsizing our military
for the last seven years, and the Kosovo crisis has exposed how our
national security is now in real danger,'' the speaker said,
promising that the Republican leadership would seek to add funds to
bolster the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said in a statement,
``Even $10 billion would be insufficient'' to rebuild the military.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., opposed adding more
funds to this emergency package and said that he would ``probably
encourage the president to veto a bad bill'' and ask Congress to
send him a stripped-down version.
</P>
<P>
   Funding for the Balkan air war, or for any other military
spending added to the measure, would not be subject to
congressional spending caps because it would be labeled
``emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   That means the extra spending would be drawn from the expected
surplus, all of which is coming from Social Security tax
collections, said Susan Tanaka, president of the Committee for a
Responsible Budget, a private watchdog group.

OLYMPIC PANEL ADOPTS MORALS CLAUSE IN SPONSORSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee will allow corporate
sponsors to terminate future marketing agreements if the IOC does
anything to harm the image of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The adoption of a so-called morals clause, a reaction to scandal
revelations of bribery before the awarding of the Winter Games to
Salt Lake City in 2002, is the first by any major sports
organization or league. Until now, sports industry observers said,
morals clauses have been used by businesses in endorsement deals
with athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we want to do to acknowledge that it is a
two-way street with our sponsors,'' said Michael Payne, marketing
director for the IOC, who said the new policy will apply to any new
sponsorship deals signed for games after the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney. ``We always have had requirements for how the sponsors
could use our Olympic symbols and marks in their marketing. Now, we
want the sponsors to know that there will be some reciprocity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't anticipate having problems like we have had recently
ever again,'' said Payne, speaking from the IOC's offices in
Lausanne, Switzerland. ``But should something like it ever occur
again, heaven forbid, and if we did not fix it right away, there
would be recourse for the sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   The step by the IOC is a major victory for the corporate
sponsors, who pay an average of $50 million to sponsor the Olympics
for four years. The companies have sought significant reform from
the IOC before signing new sponsorship deals this spring and
summer, observers and officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Businessmen close to recent negotiations with the IOC and its
sponsors say that both the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.
and Visa International pushed hard for contractual language that
would allow them to pull out of the sponsorship agreements for just
cause.
</P>
<P>
   David D'Alessandro, Hancock's president and chief operating
officer publicly called for such exit clauses, based on the IOC's
behavior, to be part of the sponsorship agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I brought this up two months ago, Payne told me
personally that there was absolutely no reason for the clause,''
said D'Alessandro, one of the few corporate leaders who have been
willing to publicly argue the need for reforming the IOC. ``We had
a pretty significant argument about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what this is is a reluctant and belated
acknowledgement that indeed the sponsors should have more say in
this,'' D'Alessandro said. ``It's a big deal. It also tells me they
are having a real hard time trying to sign new people up.''
</P>
<P>
   While none of the top Olympic sponsors have announced any
intention to withdraw from negotiations over renewing their
marketing agreements, some have said privately that the scandal has
diminished the allure of the games, and that is having an impact on
their negotiations. And Johnson &AMP; Johnson halted negotiations with
the United States Olympic Committee in February over a prospective
deal to sponsor the games in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   American companies finance a substantial portion of the IOC
budget. Eleven of them, including Hancock and Visa, are currently
paying an average of $50 million each to use the Olympic rings and
other marks as part of their sponsorship deals. Some of the
companies have similar marketing deals with the USOC, and they
spend millions of dollars in advertising on NBC to leverage the
sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   In total, observers say, the companies represent about $1
billion in revenue for the Olympics. Several of the companies are
currently negotiating new deals with the IOC, to renew their
agreements beyond the Summer Games in 2000 in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Payne said that all of the new sponsorship deals will be covered
by the morals clause. ``It's something I have already approached
the executive committee on, and they have approved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a first for an organization of that type,'' said Lance
Helgeson, managing editor of the IEG Sponsorship Report, a
Chicago-based newsletter that reports on the sponsorship industry
and just finished hosting an international conference dedicated to
the topic. ``From a standpoint of a property like the Olympics _
which is more of a league product than anything else _ this has
definitely not been seen before, and it's real pioneering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of stunning, really,'' said Bob Williams, president
of Burns Sports Celebrity Service, a Chicago-based company that
links advertisers with athletes for endorsements. ``We are at the
point of always advising our companies now to ask for really strict
morals language in almost all of their endorsement deals with
individual athletes. But this is like the reverse of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the businesses looking for some assurance from the
sport itself, that it won't do anything to harm their investment''
Williams said

RED SOX SPOIL HOLIDAY MOOD OF HOME CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
Devil Rays 4, Red Sox 1 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- If this is the future, Red Sox fans had better dig in
for a long season. It took only six home games to indicate that the
1999 edition can't depend upon the old magic to ensure success at
Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   A Patriots Day crowd of 33,167 witnessed a lifeless 4-1 loss to
Tampa Bay, as it was evident that the Olde Towne Team lacks the
offensive sock associated with past regimes.
</P>
<P>
   After opening the season 6-1 (including a win in the Fenway
opener), the Sox went 1-4 since on the first homestand. If you
think this is an fluke, than think again.
</P>
<P>
   They Red Sox are losing games to teams like the doormat White
Sox and Devil Rays not only because of a lack of power, but also
because of a lack of consistency throughout the order. This is not
what the Red Sox had in mind when they came home last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We faced one of the best pitchers in the league today in
Rolando Arrojo,'' reminded Jeff Frye, who had two hits Monday. ``At
11 o'clock. In the shadows of Fenway. He was tough. And I'm not
making excuses. The ball I hit in the eighth hit the runner (Jose
Offerman, which thwarted a rally). That's kind of the way our luck
has been going lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last three games we have struggled a bit. The pitchers
are doing a great job. But the rest of us have to do our part. I
wouldn't look for a big turnaround with home runs. We're not a home
run-type of team. We need base hits, two-out RBIs, moving guys
over. That's the type of team we have. That's the type of team we
have to learn to be.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Tampa Bay that used the long ball in this series. Jose
Canseco, who hit three homers in the series, was silent Monday. But
another former Red Sox, John Flaherty picked up the slack with a
run-scoring double in the second in the second and a solo home run
in the sixth to pin Bret Saberhagen (2-1) with his first defeat.
Saberhagen gave up two runs in the second. The Sox got one back in
the fifth on a controversial home run by Offerman (whose shot to
right appeared to have hit the railing).
</P>
<P>
   Offerman's 417 average in 12 games has been a bright spot, but
the rest of the bats have been sporadic at best. Nomar Garciaparra
(.294) can't find daylight, yet. The outfield _ Trot Nixon (.071),
Damon Buford (.250), Troy O'Leary (.267), and Darren Lewis (.167)
has been punchless. Reggie Jefferson, his back problems cured, made
his first start of the season as designated hitter and went 1 for
4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll snap out of it,'' said Sox manager Jimy Williams.
``There are just too many good hitters in that lineup. Arrojo was
tough. But I still feel good about our hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams couldn't have felt good about what happened in the
eighth, when the Sox put two runners on with two outs, only to see
the rally disintergrate in a matter of seconds. Jason Varitek had
hit two-out double and Offerman walked, setting the stage for a
possible big inning. Frye was at the plate and Tampa countered by
bringing in closer Roberto Hernandez. Frye hit a 3-0 pitch that was
headed toward right field but instead hit Offerman for the third
out. By rule, Frye was credited with a single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never did see the ball,'' confessed Offerman. ``It's hard to
see the ball in the daylight here. But that's not all to it. We
haven't played the same game that we played on the road. We know
we're going to get it back. Until then, we take one day at a
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Frye said the Sox have to forget about this homestand and get
back to basics Tuesday night in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're not looking for the big inning,'' he said.
``We've got to put together a good solid attack the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody has to accept some of the blame, added Saberhagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little frustrating,'' said Saberhagen. ``We hate to
come here and not play in our first homestand the way we had been
playing. (Tampa Bay) played well and deserved to win three of four.
</P>
<P>
   ``What hurt me today was a leadoff walk in the second which led
to two runs., You have to make guys earn their way on. Then we get
a run back at 2-1 and I kind of let them get a run back for 3-1.
They played a very good series against us.''

A BIRTHRIGHT DENIED? ADOPTEES SEEK THEIR ORIGINAL CERTIFICATES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CAROL CHRISTIAN 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Cyndi Smith wants her birth certificate.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound like a small matter, but because the Houston woman
was adopted, her original birth certificate is sealed by Texas law.
The document she has, though legal, was filled in months after her
birth to make it appear that her adoptive mother gave literal birth
to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of getting the original birth certificate is just
that _ to get it and see it, to have the confirmation of oneself,''
said Smith, 35, who was born in Fort Worth and adopted by Bryan
residents through the Gladney Center for Adoption. ``It's not fair
for some people in society to have access to this knowledge and
others to be legally barred from having it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another adoptee, Pamela Hannah of Austin, describes her altered
birth certificate _ which is dated July 1964 but lists an address
that her adoptive parents didn't occupy until spring 1965 _ as
``legal fiction to forever erase the truth of my birth.''
</P>
<P>
   By joining the Texas fight for adoptees' access to original
birth certificates, Smith and Hannah have put themselves in the
middle of an emotional national debate.
</P>
<P>
   On one side is an unknown number of adoptees and birth parents
yearning to connect with each other. On the other side are women
clinging to their privacy, afraid or unwilling to dredge up
memories of what for many was the most painful time of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   A bill to open access to the original documents appears stalled,
for the second straight session, in the Texas Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Under current state law, whenever someone is adopted, the
original birth certificate is sealed and an amended one is issued _
even in cases in which an older child is adopted by a stepfather
and has known his or her birth father for years.
</P>
<P>
   For adult adoptees looking for birth parents, the search is
simpler with an original birth certificate. But Smith and Hannah
have already found their birth mothers. They just want the true
records.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's everyone's right to know where they came from,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is impossible to determine how many people in the
United States were adopted and what percentage of birth mothers do
not want contact with their children, one thing is certain:
Proponents of openness get the most exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who want the privacy do not feel comfortable being very
public,'' said Heidi Cox, general counsel for the 112-year-old
Gladney Center, which has the nation's largest maternity home in
Fort Worth for women planning adoption for their babies.
</P>
<P>
   Some birth mothers don't want to be found because nobody in
their family _ including parents, husband and other children _
knows the secret, said Sylvia Franzmeier, program manager for
adoption and post-adoption services at DePelchin Children's Center
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to tell their current children is especially hard
for some birth mothers, Franzmeier said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel like telling about it would change their children's
opinion of them,'' she said. ``In real life, it doesn't, but that's
what they feel like.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes birth mothers don't want the intrusion in their lives
and think they should not intrude on the adopted person's life,
Franzmeier said. She noted, however, that most birth mothers
contacted by DePelchin at the request of adoptees not only don't
mind the intrusion but are overjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Other birth mothers don't want contact because they were rape
victims or had hostile relationships with birth fathers, said Paige
Smith, Gladney Center spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or it could be as simple as they are not emotionally prepared
for a meeting with the adopted child at this point and they want to
be able to have some element of control over when that meeting
takes place, if it ever does,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the case for open access appears to be losing in Austin,
the debate is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Cyndi Smith, a computer programmer, is co-founder of the Texas
Coalition for Adoption Resources and Education. The 110-member
group rallied for birth-certificate access in January in Austin and
since then has been lobbying legislators to pass House Bill 13.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which faces an uphill battle, would allow adoptees age
21 or older to get their original birth certificates and would
prevent revision of an original certificate if the court, adoptive
parents or an adoptee age 12 or older requests that it remain
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   House Bill 13 is likely to die in the Juvenile Justice and
Family Issues Committee before being brought to a vote, said
committee chairman Rep. Toby Goodman, R-Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, who opposes the bill, said the law could drive birth
mothers to place their babies with agencies in other states and
adoptive parents to look for children out of state or out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have Texas babies going out of state and foreign
babies coming into Texas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsor is Rep. Tony Goolsby, R-Dallas. He is working
on a revised bill that might have a better chance of coming to a
vote in committee, said an aide.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah's birth mother, Joyce Obenhaus of Freeport, has also
lobbied for House Bill 13.
</P>
<P>
   Obenhaus, who was a 27-year-old secretary at Rice University
when she became pregnant by a graduate student, said she had never
looked for her daughter because she was afraid Hannah would be
bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I know she doesn't hate me,'' Obenhaus said, ``I wish
I had tried to contact her years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Hannah has met both her birth parents, she said it is
patronizing to be denied her original birth certificate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk, we visit, there's nothing left to hide,'' she said.
``And I still can't get any of the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas and Alaska are the only states offering all adult
adoptees access to their original birth certificates. Ohio provides
it for any adoptee born before 1964 unless the original record was
sealed by specific request. Tennessee passed an access law in 1996
that survived a challenge in the federal court system but is now
being contested at the state level. In the past year, Oregon and
Delaware have passed access laws that are being challenged in
court.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, state Rep. Debra Danburg, D-Houston, has been a vocal
opponent of adoptees getting original birth certificates against
birth parents' wishes. She said she would oppose House Bill 13 as
long as it amounted to a government edict to expose birth parents
despite promises to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Danburg said she supports easier access to birth registries
where adult adoptees and birth parents can find each other if both
sign up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that curiosity,'' Danburg said. ``If I were
adopted, I would very much be that kind of person.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyndi Smith said she has spoken to birth mothers and heard of
others who attempted suicide because they feared they would never
know anything about their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are adoptees who attempted suicide because they didn't
know where they came from,'' Cyndi Smith said. ``It's a very
emotional issue on all sides. You can't deny the other person the
right to their own emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of House Bill 13 say existing laws never promised
birth mothers confidentiality in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Wanger, a Fort Worth-area attorney who has researched
Texas adoption law, said she found no statute that guarantees
confidentiality for birth parents. Instead, Wanger said,
confidentiality concerns have focused on adoptees _ on their right
to avoid the stigma of illegitimacy by keeping their birth records
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Wanger said, adoptions have usually involved both
a hearing to terminate birth parents' rights to the child and an
adoption hearing.
</P>
<P>
   To get their adoption records, adoptees have needed court orders
since 1973, when the Legislature reorganized all types of family
law into the Family Code and created a confidential central record
file. Termination files, by contrast, have never been confidential
unless there was a court order sealing a particular file.
</P>
<P>
   To show that birth mothers have not typically been promised
confidentiality, the Texas coalition has begun collecting copies of
relinquishment affidavits. Of about 25 gathered so far, none
promised the birth mother privacy, Smith said. In fact,
relinquishment affidavits are part of the termination proceeding,
and if the termination proceeding has not been sealed, anybody can
access that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has the birth mother's name loud and clear,'' Smith said of
a typical relinquishment document. ``It points out that it's not
the birth mothers being protected.''

<HEADLINE>
THE 10 MOST COMMON CAR-SEAT MISTAKES
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies CAR SEAT WARS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. Safety seat is in the car too loose. (You should not be able
to move it side to side or up and down more than 1 inch in any
direction.)
</P>
<P>
   2. Harness does not fit snug around the child. (If more than one
finger can be inserted between the harness belts and the child, it
is not snug enough.)
</P>
<P>
   3. Back-facing seat is not angled properly. (An infant should
ride sitting semi-reclined at a 45-degree angle so that breathing
is not obstructed if his head slumps forward. Place a rolled-up
towel or section of a ``fun noodle'' under the front edge of the
seat to achieve the proper angle.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Baby's head is not properly supported. (Infants may need
extra cushioning pads, rolled-up towels or rolled-up diapers around
their heads for support.)
</P>
<P>
   5. The harness retainer clip is out of place or not threaded
correctly. The clip should be in the middle of the chest, at armpit
level to prevent shoulder straps from slipping off.
</P>
<P>
   6. The locking clip is not used correctly to take up the slack
in seat belts that do not have locking or switchable retractors.
(See details in short accompanying story on locking clips.)
</P>
<P>
   7. Shoulder belts are not worn properly. Children often move
belts under their arms or behind their backs so that they are more
comfortable, but improper placement of belts can cause broken ribs
or internal injuries if there's a crash. Make sure lap belts fit
low and tight across the upper thighs and the shoulder belt crosses
the collarbone and chest _ never the neck or face.
</P>
<P>
   8. A booster seat is used without a shoulder strap. In some
cars, there are only lap straps and no shoulder straps in the back
seat. In most cars, the center seat does not have a shoulder strap.
Booster seats should not be used without shoulder straps, because
they leave the upper body unrestrained.
</P>
<P>
   9. An older child is put into the car's regular lap and shoulder
belts too soon. Booster seats are designed to make lap and shoulder
belts fit small bodies properly. Usually, seat belts will not
properly fit until a child is about 8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   10. Babies are bundled up too much to assure a safe, secure fit
of their car seats. If additional warmth is needed, a blanket can
be placed over the baby and the seat itself after the baby is
secured in the seat.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Rear-facing car seats:
</P>
<P>
   Babies should be kept in rear-facing infant or convertible car
seats until they are at least 1 year old and at least 20 pounds.
This offers the best protection for the baby's neck. The
rear-facing seat should be reclined at a 45-degree angle.
</P>
<P>
   Forward-facing seats:
</P>
<P>
   Children from age 1 to 40 pounds may ride in a convertible
safety seat facing forward or a forward-facing-only child seat.
Seats come in three harness styles: five-point, T-shield or
tray-shield. The five-point harness is most often recommended
because it can be adjusted to fit almost all sizes and shapes of
children up to 40 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Booster seats:
</P>
<P>
   Children between 40 and about 60 to 80 pounds (usually 4 to 8
years old) should be in booster seats. Booster seats make safety
belts fit right. Move your child to a booster seat when he outgrows
his forward-facing car seat, and keep him in the booster until your
vehicle's regular lap and shoulder straps fit properly across the
upper thighs and snug over the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   What the heck is a locking clip (and how does it work)?
</P>
<P>
   First: Don't throw it away.
</P>
<P>
   The locking clip is usually attached to the side or back of most
new child-safety seats, and you need to immediately check your
vehicle owner's manual to see if it's necessary to secure your
safety seat.
</P>
<P>
   Clips are needed to provide tight installation of safety seats
in cars with ``emergency-locking'' retractors _ seat belts that
lock only with a sudden stop or collision (most cars made before
1996) and in newer cars that do not allow you to switch it to
automatic locking.
</P>
<P>
   An ``automatic locking'' retractor locks whenever you stop
pulling it out and will hold a safety seat tightly without a
locking clip. An emergency-locking retractor will not.
</P>
<P>
   If your belts cannot be switched to automatic, the locking clip
must be used to take up the slack in the safety belts.
</P>
<P>
   To install the clip:
</P>
<P>
   _Put the seat belt through the correct path on the safety seat
and buckle it.
</P>
<P>
   _Push down on the safety seat and pull up on the shoulder end of
the belt until the belt is pulled tight.
</P>
<P>
   _Hold the two parts of the belt together at the latchplate and
unbuckle it.
</P>
<P>
   _Thread the belt though the locking clip, close to the
latchplate.
</P>
<P>
   _Buckle the belt again. If you put the clip on correctly, the
belt should stay tight around the safety seat.
</P>
<P>
   _Remove the locking clip when the belt is not holding a safety
seat.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget
</P>
<P>
   _The back seat is the safest place for children to ride in a
motor vehicle. Never place a child in the front seat in a vehicle
equipped with passenger-side air bags.
</P>
<P>
   _Read and follow the manufacturer's instructions for installing
and using your particular safety seat.
</P>
<P>
   _Consult your vehicle owner's manual concerning which seats best
fit your vehicle and how to install those seats.
</P>
<P>
   _For a convertible or front-facing seat, secure the car seat
snugly with the seat belt. Then, with the child out of the seat,
press your knee down into the car seat with all your weight while
pulling the seat belt even tighter.
</P>
<P>
   _Never buckle two people _ kids or adults _ into one seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   _Never use a car seat that has been involved in a crash. (They
are designed to withstand one crash.)
</P>
<P>
   _Never use a car seat that does not have a label saying it
conforms to federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   _Don't throw away your car-seat registration form. You need to
send in the registration form so that you can be notified if your
car seat is recalled. If you have any questions or wish to report
any problems, call the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration's Auto Safety Hot Line, (800) 424-9393), or check
the Department of Transportation home page at www.nhtsa.dot.gov.

 &HT;    Ethiopia's Roba wins with over two minutes' lead
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Since wrapping herself in her country's flag after
claiming Olympic victory in Atlanta, Fatuma Roba has become into a
favorite daughter of the Boston Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Her name is right up there with women from different eras _
Kathrine Switzer, Joan Benoit Samuelson, Rosa Mota and Ingrid
Kristiansen, to name a few. And now she ranks alongside the
grandest of them all, Uta Pippig, the only woman before Monday's
103rd edition of the storied race to win three straight.
</P>
<P>
   Running in a fluid style combining grace and subtle authority,
Roba grabbed the lead at the halfway point from 20-year-old Chinese
upstart Sun Yingjie and spent the rest of the afternoon bolstered
by her Ethiopian supporters who occasionally wandered onto the
course. They would run beside her for short spells, waving their
country's red, yellow and green flag. At 20 miles, she donned a
headband in her country's colors, a gift from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I have run in Boston, I have had great support from
the Ethiopian community,'' said Roba, an officer in her country's
army. ``At one point, in a hilly area, I was tired and the support
gave me a boost and I run with a new pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Roba's time of 2 hours, 23 minutes, 25 seconds was more than two
minutes faster than runner-up Franziska Rochat-Moser of Switzerland
and the fourth fastest ever at Boston. Early on, Roba said, she was
unaware that Yingjie had broken fast, running just off the lead
men's group and clocking five-minutes miles.
</P>
<P>
   Yingjie, who fell back to 11th, and countrywoman Ai Dongmei came
close to missing the race when they ran into visa problems. But
Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) intervened, and the two elite Chinese
athletes made it to the starting line.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one took (Yingjie) seriously,'' Rochat-Moser said of the
rapid pace. ``I think it was her first experience running outside
her country.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Boston, and first-timers don't manhandle the rolling
hills.
</P>
<P>
   Except Roba, who was an unknown in 1996 when she entered the
Olympic stadium in Atlanta far in front of her competitors and
became the first black African woman to win marathon gold at the
Games.
</P>
<P>
   The next spring, her first at Boston, she was intent on
validating her Olympic win. She did so and is now 3-for-3 there.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, she has not run well elsewhere. She dropped out of the
1997 world championships in Athens, Greece. The rolling courses of
Atlanta and Boston have suited her well.
</P>
<P>
   Now, her goal is a gold medal at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney,
which would match her late countryman Abebe Bikila, men's marathon
champion in 1960 and 1964. Roba refuses to put herself in the same
category with the Ethiopian hero, though acknowledges that she has
emerged as a role model for her country's children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they want to be like me,'' she said.

 &HT;    Kenyan Chebet no longer second
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Back home in Kenyan, Joseph Chebet had evolved into the
Avis of marathons. Always a bridesmaid, never a bride.
</P>
<P>
   He had been run down at Boston last year and, in his last two
starts of the New York Marathon, lost by a combined six seconds.
That was left to the past Monday when Chebet handled the
come-from-behind business, pulling away from Silvio Guerra of
Ecuador with about four miles to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to be second,'' said a relieved Chebet. ``I like
to be first..''
</P>
<P>
   Chebet came home in 2 hours, 9 minutes, 52 seconds, only the
38th fastest Boston time ever. It helped that two-time champion
Moses Tanui was felled by leg cramps.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Chebet benefitted from the inexperience of Guerra,
starting just his fourth marathon. Guerra proved impatient with the
slow first-half pace and surged up the hills of Newton late on the
course before Chebet easily took back the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left (the pack), I was thinking I could win,'' said
Guerra, his black hair tied in a ponytail. ``I felt strong and
ready to win. I didn't know how hard the end would be.''
</P>
<P>
   RECORD SHY: Affectionately dubbed ``Boston Billy,'' Bill
Rodgers' run at an American record for over-50 marathoners ended
with him dropping out almost 21 miles. The four-time Boston winner
suffered dehydration and received medical treatment along the
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``My body is telling me it can't run hard any more,'' Rodgers
said. ``I can't push hard for records.''
</P>
<P>
   Another top American, Lynn Jennings, enjoyed an only slightly
better afternoon. Jennings, a nine-time national cross-country
champ and Barcelona Olympic bronze medalist in the 10,000 meters,
finished 12th in her first official marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ROLLING ON: Franz Nietlispach took home to Switzerland his
fourth Boston title, winning the men's wheelchair race in a
personal-best 1:21:36. Louise Sauvage won her third straight title
in the women's wheelchair, outsprinting seven-time champ Jean
Driscoll to the finish line in 1:42:23.

US-AIDED NUCLEAR DISMANTLING IN RUSSIA CONTINUES APACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SERGIYEV POSAD, Russia _ Relations between the United states and
Russia may have reached their lowest point since the fall of the
Berlin Wall, but remarkably, that has not stopped a US-funded
program to dismantle the decaying, but still deadly, nuclear
arsenal of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   At a secret defense factory in this industrial town north of
Moscow, Russian submarine-launched ballistic missiles, which were
once aimed at U.S. cities, are being disarmed and dismantled _ with
American equipment and funding.
</P>
<P>
   A nearby training center for Russia's strategic rocket forces
uses techniques and equipment supplied by US specialists to weed
out Russians unfit to work with Moscow's nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Moscow wages a war of words with Washington over the
conflict in the Balkans, more than $1 billion in US-funded projects
to reduce the threat posed by Russia's weapons of mass destruction
have continued almost unabated.
</P>
<P>
   The hardiness of these projects, commonly referred to as the
``Nunn-Lugar'' program after its Congressional sponsors, former
Senator Sam Nunn and Senator Richard Lugar, provides a measure of
geopolitical comfort despite a chill in US-Russian relations not
seen since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The staying power of these joint projects despite hard times in
the relationship even suggests a model for how the West could have
better used the billions of dollars it spent to support Russia's
sporadic, and so far largely unsucessful, attempts at economic
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians see real results from Nunn-Lugar money,'' said
Pavel Felgenhauer, defense analyst for the Moscow daily Segodnya.
``Unlike other aid, where all of the money was spent and nothing
changed, with Nunn-Lugar money concrete things did happen. So the
Russians want to keep these programs, despite their suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Russian politicians, and many ordinary citizens, are upset at
the bombardment of a fellow Slavic, Orthodox Christian nation by
NATO, an alliance that until a decade ago was the Cold War
arch-enemy of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has consistently portrayed the United States as the
aggressor in the Balkan conflict, and Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, whom the West accuses of atrocities against ethnic
Albanians, as the victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton hopes to win, he hopes Milosevic will capitulate,
give up the whole of Yugoslavia, make it America's protectorate. We
will not allow this. This is a strategic place, the Balkans,''
President Boris N. Yeltsin said Monday to a meeting of Russian
editors and publishers. ``We simply cannot ditch Milosevic. We want
to embrace him as tight as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments have led to cancellation or postponement of
dozens of joint initiatives between Russia and NATO because, in the
words of one senior Russian commander, Gen. Leonid Ivashov, ``they
are no longer appropriate at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   But across Russia, a number of Nunn-Lugar programs _ which allow
Americans access to highly sensitive and until recently,
top-secret, technology _ are still under way.
</P>
<P>
   They include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Construction of a new storage site in the Ural Mountains to
keep 6,000 bombs' worth of nuclear material out of the wrong hands;
</P>
<P>
   _ A laboratory that will make it easier to keep track of
Russia's 42,000 metric tons of chemical weapons, a stockpile
capable of destroying all life on Earth many times over;
</P>
<P>
   _ Equipment and funding to help destroy ballistic missiles,
missile launchers, strategic bombers and nuclear submarines under
the 1991 Start I arms reduction treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In the first days after NATO began its airstrikes, Russia asked
that a planned review session of the program in Moscow be
postponed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But nothing else has been canceled,'' said an American
official close to the project. ``This is an incredibly tense and
difficult time for us, and there are things to work out on both
sides. They had to ask themselves a few questions. But we're moving
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nunn-Lugar program was initially created when the Soviet
Union collapsed and it became clear the successor states did not
have the resources to eliminate the cold war arsenal. Since 1991,
more than $2 billion in US funds have gone toward eliminating 3,800
nuclear weapons in Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Belarus _ the entire
nuclear arsenals of those countries _ plus reducing Russia's
arsenal by 96 submarine missile launchers, 50 missile silos, 273
strategic ballistic missiles and 30 bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Under agreements already reached, an additional 711 missiles and
many more submarine missile launch tubes will be eliminated. Other
programs, such as improving security at 50 nuclear weapons sites,
training personnel, and safeguarding transport and storage of
fissile materials _ are aimed at preventing the export of weapons
of mass destruction from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Russian military had a difficult time getting used
to the idea that Americans would pay to dismantle Russian weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first there was a big psychological problem,'' said Igor
Safranchuk of the Center for Policy Studies, a Moscow think tank
that monitors strategic arms control issues. ``Russian scientists
didn't believe that Americans would help. But when equipment and
money started coming, the mood changed. There was a sense of
humbled national pride, that Americans were financing disarmanent
by Russia, but it passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Commented the US official: ``It took time to build trust, to get
on that base where you would have been shot dead a few years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   US and Russian observers acknowledge that the Nunn-Lugar
programs have only made a dent in Russia's legacy of the nuclear
arms race. But sources on both sides call the program a success.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as February, Gen. Igor Valynkin, who heads Russia's
department for nuclear safety, praised the US aid, which he said
included special containers for transporting Russian warheads,
computers for keeping tabs on atomic weapons, emergency kits, and
screening equipment such as polygraphs for the training center in
Sergiyev Posad.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the computers (provided by the US) have been certififed by
Russian specialists,'' Valynkin commented. ``They have no bugs or
any other hidden devices to obtain secret information.''
</P>
<P>
   Valynkin's remarks point to another success of the Nunn-Lugar
program. While the officials in charge of economic reform in
Yeltsin's governments have almost all been young economists who
professed pro-Western views, the same could not be said about the
military officials and defense factory directors the US has dealt
with under Nunn-Lugar programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the International Monetary Fund gave Russia credits, they
would say, `now, restructure the economy','' said Safronchuk.
``Nunn-Lugar didn't work like that. They would say, `build this
facility' or `destroy these missiles.' And when the work was done,
then the Russians would get their money.''
</P>
<P>
   The program has also established direct contact with Russian
companies, said Russian and US sources, providing jobs and business
at a time when most factories are at a standstill. This, too, is a
reason why Nunn-Lugar has continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should Russia refuse hundreds of millions of dollars? That
would be foolish,'' said Alexander Pikayev, an arms control analyst
at the Carnegie Moscow Center. ``Because Russia receives American
money and technology, the US in return receives more transparency
of the Russian nuclear infrastructure, and maintaining this is very
important for the US.''

OLYMPIC PANEL ADOPTS MORALS CLAUSE IN SPONSORSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee will allow corporate
sponsors to terminate future marketing agreements if the IOC does
anything to harm the image of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The adoption of a so-called morals clause, a reaction to scandal
revelations of bribery before the awarding of the Winter Games to
Salt Lake City in 2002, is the first by any major sports
organization or league. Until now, sports industry observers said,
morals clauses have been used by businesses in endorsement deals
with athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we want to do to acknowledge that it is a
two-way street with our sponsors,'' said Michael Payne, marketing
director for the IOC, who said the new policy will apply to any new
sponsorship deals signed for games after the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney. ``We always have had requirements for how the sponsors
could use our Olympic symbols and marks in their marketing. Now, we
want the sponsors to know that there will be some reciprocity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't anticipate having problems like we have had recently
ever again,'' said Payne, speaking from the IOC's offices in
Lausanne, Switzerland. ``But should something like it ever occur
again, heaven forbid, and if we did not fix it right away, there
would be recourse for the sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   The step by the IOC is a major victory for the corporate
sponsors, who pay an average of $50 million to sponsor the Olympics
for four years. The companies have sought significant reform from
the IOC before signing new sponsorship deals this spring and
summer, observers and officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Businessmen close to recent negotiations with the IOC and its
sponsors say that both the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.
and Visa International pushed hard for contractual language that
would allow them to pull out of the sponsorship agreements for just
cause.
</P>
<P>
   David D'Alessandro, Hancock's president and chief operating
officer publicly called for such exit clauses, based on the IOC's
behavior, to be part of the sponsorship agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I brought this up two months ago, Payne told me
personally that there was absolutely no reason for the clause,''
said D'Alessandro, one of the few corporate leaders who have been
willing to publicly argue the need for reforming the IOC. ``We had
a pretty significant argument about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what this is is a reluctant and belated
acknowledgement that indeed the sponsors should have more say in
this,'' D'Alessandro said. ``It's a big deal. It also tells me they
are having a real hard time trying to sign new people up.''
</P>
<P>
   While none of the top Olympic sponsors have announced any
intention to withdraw from negotiations over renewing their
marketing agreements, some have said privately that the scandal has
diminished the allure of the games, and that is having an impact on
their negotiations. And Johnson &AMP; Johnson halted negotiations with
the United States Olympic Committee in February over a prospective
deal to sponsor the games in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   American companies finance a substantial portion of the IOC
budget. Eleven of them, including Hancock and Visa, are currently
paying an average of $50 million each to use the Olympic rings and
other marks as part of their sponsorship deals. Some of the
companies have similar marketing deals with the USOC, and they
spend millions of dollars in advertising on NBC to leverage the
sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   In total, observers say, the companies represent about $1
billion in revenue for the Olympics. Several of the companies are
currently negotiating new deals with the IOC, to renew their
agreements beyond the Summer Games in 2000 in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Payne said that all of the new sponsorship deals will be covered
by the morals clause. ``It's something I have already approached
the executive committee on, and they have approved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a first for an organization of that type,'' said Lance
Helgeson, managing editor of the IEG Sponsorship Report, a
Chicago-based newsletter that reports on the sponsorship industry
and just finished hosting an international conference dedicated to
the topic. ``From a standpoint of a property like the Olympics _
which is more of a league product than anything else _ this has
definitely not been seen before, and it's real pioneering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of stunning, really,'' said Bob Williams, president
of Burns Sports Celebrity Service, a Chicago-based company that
links advertisers with athletes for endorsements. ``We are at the
point of always advising our companies now to ask for really strict
morals language in almost all of their endorsement deals with
individual athletes. But this is like the reverse of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the businesses looking for some assurance from the
sport itself, that it won't do anything to harm their investment''
Williams said

RENOUNCE THE RACISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Well, it just seems to me that each race should keep
themselves pure. If we have too much race mixing, it's going to
wipe out the white race. We're far outnumbered by the blacks,
browns, yellows.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were the sentiments in 1987 of a New Hampshire state
senator, John Parker Hale Chandler Jr. They came up during an
interview in which he insisted that he was not racist, merely
concerned about the ``mongrelization'' of the white race.
</P>
<P>
   What made Hale's views on race newsworthy that year was that he
served as the honorary chairman for Merrimack County of Jack Kemp's
presidential campaign, and had been going around telling a boorish
joke about Jesse Jackson's grandmother. He had also been quoted as
saying that it revolted him to see Jackson kiss the daughter of a
white supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans reacted to Chandler's racism in different ways. The
then-governor of New Hampshire, John Sununu, allowed as how
Chandler's views were ``an unfortunate, inappropriate comment to
make.'' The chairman of the state Republican Party, Elsie
Vartanian, said, ``The voters have returned him on a regular basis
(and) will decide whether they want to do that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Kemp, by contrast, offered Chandler a choice: Apologize publicly
or resign. Chandler refused to apologize. Kemp booted him.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what Chandler is doing these days, but I wouldn't
be surprised if he is active in the Council of Conservative
Citizens, the racist political group to which a few well-known
Republicans _ notably Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott _ have
ties. The CCC seems to share Chandler's concerns about
``mongrelization.'' In one of its recent newsletters, Robert B.
Patterson, a regular contributor, writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can deny the importance of the question of
miscegenation or race-mixing. Its very essence involves the
preservation of the white race as well as the Negro race. It is a
matter of racial survival. . . . Any effort to destroy the (white)
race by a mixture of black blood is an effort to destroy Western
civilization itself.''
</P>
<P>
   CCC publications drip with this kind of poison. So does its Web
site. Its racist core and roots are not in doubt; it was built from
the remnants of the old segregationist Citizens Councils of
America. The CCC has some sway in the Deep South; its largest
membership is in Mississippi. The notion that an experienced
Mississippi politician wouldn't know what the CCC is about is,
shall we say, highly dubious. Yet, that was what Lott claimed when
he was first asked about the group in December. He had ``no
firsthand knowledge'' of the CCC's beliefs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That was almost certainly a lie. Lott has long been involved
with these people. He has spoken at their gatherings, invited their
leaders to his Senate office, and twice asked their top Mississippi
operative to chair his Senate campaign in his native Carroll
County. He addressed the CCC's national board in 1992. ``The people
in this room,'' he told them, ``stand for the right principles and
the right philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and conservatives have a choice when it comes to
dealing with a noxious outfit like the CCC. They can forthrightly
denounce it and sever all ties with its members _ the approach Kemp
took with Chandler in 1987. Or, like Sununu and the New Hampshire
GOP chairman that year, they can offer a bland noncondemnation,
proclaiming their own virtue while being careful not to alienate
the racists.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Lott assured the Anti-Defamation League that he
``can't imagine being associated with an organization that promotes
any form of racial supremacy.'' But he is associated with such an
organization, and he refuses to anathematize it. So have his
Republican colleagues. When US Representative Robert Wexler
introduced a resolution denouncing ``the racism and bigotry
espoused by the Council of Conservative Citizens,'' House
Republicans declined to support it. (They tried to substitute it
with a resolution blandly rebuking ``all who practice or promote
racism.'') Out of deference to Lott, no Republican will propose
Wexler's resolution in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   This is intolerable. Over the years, Republicans and
conservatives have shown an admirable willingness to excommunicate
the haters and crazies in their ranks. In the 1960s, William F.
Buckley and National Review drummed the John Birch Society _ an
anti-Communist group given to wild accusations and conspiracy
theories _ out of the modern conservative movement. More recently,
when members of a George Bush campaign committee turned out to be
hard-core anti-Semites, he axed them. David Duke's electoral bids
have been shunned by the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
   By tiptoeing around the CCC, Republicans and conservatives are
jeopardizing that record of not tolerating hate-peddlers. When
Jesse Jackson and the congressional Black Caucus balked at
denouncing Louis Farrakhan's grotesque Nation of Islam, it said
something about their willingness to confront moral degeneracy. By
the same token, if Republican leaders cannot say openly that they
despise the CCC, they will have said something important about
their values.
</P>
<P>
   There is no place in our politics for this kind of vermin. There
should be no place in the Senate for a majority leader who can't
say so.

THAT OTHER WAR AND THIS WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Although the room was filled with hard-nosed,
hard-news executives, an air of unreality drizzled on the gilded
ballroom sconces of the Fairmont Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society of Newspaper Editors had asked the White
House to explain the administration's aims in Kosovo. President
Clinton volunteered for the job himself. He spoke for an hour,
including a question-and-answer session. I listened intently.
Unlike many pundits and politicians, I have yet to develop strong
and sure opinions on military action in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Op-ed pages bristle with armchair Eisenhowers, mapping tactics
and strategy on how to stay or when to go. As former doves and
onetime hawks exchange plumage, the missing factor in this
dreamworld debate is speculative, but important.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when American casualties begin to accumulate? After
three weeks, the air war is still a melody played in a video
arcade. Ground troops will be needed in Kosovo if and when, as the
president said in his speech, ``the refugees return under the
protection of an international force.''
</P>
<P>
   Even pilots are not safe. The air of unreality in the
president's speech came not from what he said, but what he did not
say. He began his speech at 12:07. At 12:14 he discussed risk:
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the operation, we focused properly on
Serbia's highly developed air defenses to reduce the risks to our
pilots. There are still significant air defenses up, and therefore
there is still risk with every mission.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not return to the subject of risk. His speech was
familiar, cover-all-bases Clintonian tick-tock, an offbrand
Kennedyesque or Sorensenesque syncopation that few can quote or
remember:
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO would be discredited _ yes, because it made promises not
kept, but more important because its values and vision of Europe
would be profoundly damaged. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the stand we have taken, first in Bosnia, now in Kosovo,
against organized ethnic hatred is a moral imperative. But it is
also a strategic imperative. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Now at the end of the 20th century, we face a great battle
between the forces of integration and the forces of disintegration;
the forces of globalism vs. tribalism; of oppression against
empowerment. And the phenomenal explosion of technology, including
that of advanced weaponry, might be the servant of either side or
both.''
</P>
<P>
   An editor asked about the friendly-fire deaths of Kosovar
civilians last week. Stuff happens, the president replied: ``This
is not a business of perfection.''
</P>
<P>
   As tragic as that incident was, the dead were nameless and
faceless to most Americans. The funeral for the first American
casualty, however, is likely to be televised live, igniting debates
in kitchens, church halls, and coffee shops.
</P>
<P>
   At Oxford in 1939, young Englishmen debated defending Poland
against Nazi Germany. ``Die for Danzig?'' they asked. The
silver-haired grandees on the ASNE dais at the Fairmont share a
generational frame of reference. When someone mentions ``the war,''
they and Americans of a similar age think of the war that began in
1939 and ended in 1945. The heroes of that war find their ranks
diminished by time and chance, the debt owed them never fully paid.
</P>
<P>
   For many million more Americans, ``the war'' refers to an
ill-defined military action that began uncertainly in 1959 and
ended in defeat in 1975, a somber episode in what John F. Kennedy
called in his inaugural ``a long twilight struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference between World War II and the war in Vietnam is
the difference between clearly stated goals and rhetorical drift.
It is the difference between a formal declaration of war and
``mission creep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Die for Danzig?'' Such a question will not be asked while this
war remains antiseptic and undeclared. If body bags arrive at
American air bases, an answer will be required, an answer we have
not heard yet.

CRASHING TOWARD 2000, STEERING CLEAR OF TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How the electorate views the Clinton presidency in the coming
months may well determine his successor in the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   After years of Monica Lewinsky, Kenneth Starr, Whitewater, and
various scandals and controversies in Bill Clinton's tenure, the
American voters, though strongly supportive throughout Clinton's
ordeal, may be looking for a candidate less likely to generate
controversy. Voters don't want to hear, read, or watch reports on
one scandal or investigation after another generated by the
nation's leader.
</P>
<P>
   While some Republican presidential hopefuls, such as Lamar
Alexander and Dan Quayle, are attempting to come across as
occupants of the highest moral ground, they do not exactly incite
enthusiasm among many voters.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the populace is looking for something beyond
moral standards; they are also looking for someone who can, like
Clinton, do his job well and maintain the healthy economy.
</P>
<P>
   Early signs point to a presidential election battle between the
Republican with the money and the Democrat with the numbers.
Republican hopeful George W. Bush is raising money faster than any
other potential candidate. Vice President Al Gore is receiving
endorsements from large organizations, including organized labor.
He has already received the endorsement of the 600,000-member
Communications Workers of America, and is expected to receive many
more such endorsements as he makes his pitch to be labor's friend
and a friend of working families.
</P>
<P>
   Although some polls show that Republican Elizabeth Dole is
currently the front-runner in the New Hampshire primary, other
polls show Bush, the son of former President George Herbert Walker
Bush, defeating all potential candidates, including Gore, by
substantial margins.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the cerebral Bill Bradley, the former professional
basketball player and US senator from New Jersey, somehow catches
on during the Democratic primaries, Gore appears to be the
candidate who can offer voters both substance and personal
morality, if he is able to withstand controversy about his
fundraising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, too, comes with potential vulnerability. He acknowledges
without elaboration his earlier and wilder days _ ``when I was
young and irresponsible, I was young and irresponsible,'' he says
simply _ apparently hoping that by not elaborating, further
questions will go away. But in a presidental campaign, as Clinton
and former Democratic presidential hopeful Gary Hart know all too
well, such questions rarely disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is why it might be better for Bush and others to
explain their pasts, in context, early in the campaign. Not to do
so allows their opponents, or the media, to give these issues a lot
of exposure that could do more harm than an honest acknowledgment
of past misdeeds. That also protects a candidate from being on the
front pages in the final, and most dangerous, weeks of an election;
candidates who have been there would give both Gore and Bush that
advice.
</P>
<P>
   There is one thing voters do not want any candidate to be:
boring. And that means that Gore has some work to do. He needs to
rid himself of the wooden style that, for the moment, is a staple
for comedians.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he has two things in his favor: his good humor about the
jokes, and the distinct possibility that his Republican rival,
while generally perceived as a nice guy, may actually be more
boring than Gore appears.
</P>
<P>
   Gore must, in the coming months, portray himself as the
candidate who will continue Clinton's job of keeping the economy
strong, while separating himself from the scandal side of Clinton's
legacy. The Republicans, of course, will attempt to do just the
opposite _ link Gore to the negative side of the Clinton presidency
and stress that it is time for an entirely new team.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore know the task ahead of them. When the polls
open in November 2000, voters will decide which of the candidates
has best managed to be like Clinton in substance and job skills,
but bears no resemblance to the man who managed to get into enough
legal and political trouble to last voters a lifetime.

HILL COUNTY GEM: DEDICATION SET FOR REBUILT COURTHOUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILLSBORO, Texas _ When the Hill County Courthouse burned on
Jan. 1, 1993, a few distraught residents wondered whether the
historic structure should be torn down.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the clock tower had fallen to the courthouse's ground
floor and there were questions about whether the limestone exterior
was structurally sound.
</P>
<P>
   But that vocal minority was quickly drowned out. For most
residents, giving up on the old building was unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I would see my wife shed tears over a
building,'' said Hillsboro attorney Jim Showers. ``But the night of
the fire she stood there and cried. Like every Hill County native,
that courthouse meant so much to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Showers was planning a benefit concert with Hill
County native Willie Nelson. The long, costly road to bringing the
courthouse back had begun.
</P>
<P>
   Six years and approximately $10 million later, Hill County is
celebrating that perseverance. On Saturday, the structure, restored
to its original splendor, will be dedicated by Gov. George W. Bush,
and Nelson will perform again to celebrate its completion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody said they never dreamed it would take six years.
Everybody thought it would be three,'' said Hill County Judge
Kenneth Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we owed it to this 102-year-old building to try and
rebuild it, and with the help of everyone in this county and just
about everyone who ever lived here, we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who lives between Hillsboro and Itasca, said many
residents didn't appreciate the building until it was nearly gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know every time I came into town, just by habit, I would
look up there to see that clock and see what time it was,'' Davis
said. ``It really took me a year after the fire to stop looking up
and see nothing but sky.''
</P>
<P>
   In rebuilding the courthouse and the 70-foot clock tower,
project architect Larry Irsik tried to return the courthouse to the
way it looked when it opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty difficult,'' Irsik said. ``There's not any
original drawings. Surprisingly, very few original photographs
exist. There's not a single historic photograph of the district
courtroom. So what we did in some areas is totally interpretive.''
</P>
<P>
   But sorting through the burned debris of the fire, Irsik, who
works for the Dallas firm ArchiTexas, tried to account for every
piece of molding, tile and wood and its location in the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior of the building, which incorporates Classical
Revival and Italianate influences, was well known. But oral
histories from elderly Hill County residents were needed to tell
architects about the courthouse's interior before it was modernized
in the 1950s and 1960s, Irsik said.
</P>
<P>
   The two spaces that spark the most conversation inside the
renovated courthouse are the district courtroom and the basement.
</P>
<P>
   Before the fire, the courtroom's balcony had been sealed off,
the ceiling lowered, and it looked like many other old courtrooms
across Texas, Showers said. Now, it looks ready for a remake of
``To Kill a Mockingbird.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking up portions of the second and third floors, the courtroom
_ which is still smaller than the original _ includes a sweeping
balcony, a pressed metal ceiling and long-leaf pine floors that
were recycled from the renovation of the Texas Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coincidentally, much of interior is from the same era as the
Texas Capitol,'' Irsik said. ``A lot of the moldings were from
stock materials. I don't know much in the building that was custom
made. Most of the moldings were readily available in that time.''
</P>
<P>
   County officials say two weddings have been scheduled in the
courtroom, the first one on May 15, two days before the county will
begin moving its offices from a converted grocery store back into
the building.
</P>
<P>
   The cavelike basement has surprisingly drawn the most comments
from visitors, Irsik said. Workers excavated around the structure,
waterproofed it and left the natural limestone walls unadorned.
</P>
<P>
   The fire has also stirred interest in renovating other Texas
courthouses _ not just for fire safety but also to restore their
original grandeur. No longer are officials satisfied with makeshift
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Some Texas counties, such as Ellis and Hood, already have made
improvements. Others are not far behind.
</P>
<P>
   The Hood County Courthouse, which, like Hill County's, was
designed by W.C. Dodson and opened in 1891, was used as a reference
for hinges and other details in the Hill County Courthouse. The
interior of the Ellis County Courthouse, which is being renovated,
will rival the inside of Hill County's courthouse when complete,
Irsik said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has jumped into the restoration trend, proposing a
$100 million fund to renovate Texas courthouses. Officials in many
counties, such as those in Johnson County where Irsik's firm has
been hired, are eagerly waiting to see whether the Legislature
passes the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Hill County residents are thinking about the present. After
six long years, it's a point of pride that the old courthouse is
not only back, but vastly improved over the one that burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably going to be the finest restored courthouse in
the state of Texas,'' said Showers, the Hillsboro attorney. ``It
rivals the state Capitol in restoration quality. For those of us
who live here, it's awe-inspiring.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   What _ Hill County Courthouse dedication with Gov. George W.
Bush
</P>
<P>
   When _ 1:30 p.m. Saturday
</P>
<P>
   Where _ north side of the courthouse square in Hillsboro, 55
miles south of Fort Worth. Take Interstate 35W, exit at Texas 22,
go west to downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Cost _ dedication ceremony is free.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Nelson concert _ 2:30 p.m. on the south side of the
square. Cost is $25. Fences will prevent those without tickets from
seeing the show.

SALES HEAT UP FOR YEAR-END PREPAREDNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN AUSTIN 
and JAN JARVIS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Nobody can predict whether the Y2K bug will cripple or
inconvenience the civilized, computer-dependent world, but this
much is sure: Preparedness won't be cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Some opportunists have found in the Y2K craze the chance to cash
in on customers' escalating fears. Others who are concerned about
chaos spilling into the streets in 2000 have turned their living
rooms into mini grocery stores. Driving this booming cottage
industry are plenty of people eager to buy preparedness products,
even if it means a hefty investment.
</P>
<P>
   Stocking up on enough dehydrated foods for a family of four for
a year will cost about $3,000. Stash enough ready-to-eat meals to
keep that same nuclear family on three squares a day and the cost
can climb to around $14,000.
</P>
<P>
   Add a tent that sleeps six ($122), solar-powered shower ($295),
charcoal-burning stove ($280), grain mill ($116), a generator
($269) and water filter ($170) to the ammunition, weapons and
getaway survival ranch and it's easy to see that there's no limit
to how much people can _ and do _ spend. For some, the built-in
computer bug means war.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't want to wait,'' said Phyllis Hopkins,
owner of Best Prices Storable Foods in Mesquite. ``They want to
make sure they've got it now so they're not caught in the wheel
when it stops.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Jenkins of Garland has been stocking up on canned goods,
seeds and sprouts since last year. Now, with only canned eggs left
on her shopping list, she's confident that she'll be prepared for
any emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as insurance,'' she said. ``I know the kids will
have plenty of food next year, and if I don't use everything I
don't have to buy groceries.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Y2K bug will spur a crisis, Jenkins can't be
certain, but she's worried about the civil unrest that could occur
when people realize they are not as prepared as they need to be.
</P>
<P>
   All this angst stems from the so-called Y2K problem, which
arises from the inability of many computers to distinguish dates
correctly. Unmodified computers, for example, could read 2000 as
1900. The fear is that the miscalculations could lead to widespread
disruptions in a world that is increasingly dependent on
microchips.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency has said that forecasts
of cataclysmic collapse from the year 2000 computer problems are
greatly exaggerated, but many people are not buying it.
</P>
<P>
   What they are buying, many retailers insist, are products that
will function regardless of what the year is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every gun I have is Y2K compliant,'' said Dale DeGroote, sales
manager at Bob's Discount Firearms in Hurst. ``We're seeing a lot
of people buying the politically incorrect weapons. A lot of stuff
that holds 30 or more rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``politically incorrect'' hardware includes the AR-15
semiautomatic rifles he recently sold a 65-year-old woman. She
bought three rifles, 10 magazines and 3,000 rounds of ammunition.
Her tab for preparedness was $3,600.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never owned a gun in her life,'' DeGroote said, adding that he
has seen a big influx of new customers bitten by Y2K-bug phobia.
``She was going to the hills.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no average expenditure.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins' customers spend anywhere from $200 to $50,000 on
preparedness products ranging from powdered kelp to hand-cranked
grain mills. She sells $10,000 to $14,000 worth of grain mills
weekly.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that people are buying into the Y2K concept. At
Preparedness Expo '99 in Mesquite this month, about 2,000 people
showed up during the first hour it was open, said Angie Benson, who
works for the organizers of the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last year, we have seen an increase of about 30 percent
in attendance,'' she said. ``Dallas is traditionally one of our
best shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Food and water are at the top of shopping lists, but buyers are
also investing in $269 PowerPony generators from California and
$219 water filters guaranteed to eliminate 99.99 percent of E. coli
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   At Cheaper than Dirt in Fort Worth, ready-to-eat meals are
selling like hot cakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are buying meals like crazy,'' said Dan Grant, manager
at Cheaper Than Dirt, a Fort Worth store that sells camping and
outdoor survival supplies. ``We've had orders from people buying it
by the truckloads _ that's $104,000 worth of ready-to-eat meals.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Anderson, a Hurst woman who has written a book called
``Y2K For Women,'' said that if consumers spend an extra $10 a week
on basics they'll have six months' worth of food stored by Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   She suggests buying beans, rice, oil, sugar, pasta, unscented
bleach and maybe some chocolate along with a gallon of water a
week. Even if Y2K turns out to be nothing, the food can be eaten or
given away. If the worst happens people will be ready, she said.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   Katie Moore, of Carrollton, has been storing seeds, beans,
greens and other supplies over the past year. She has also
purchased a solar oven and generator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started in October,'' she said. ``I wish I had started
sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   The demand for generators is revving up to an unprecedented
pitch at Lawn &AMP; Garden Warehouse of Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big generators are on national back order,'' said Milton
Banks, spokesman for the store. ``These are all Y2K people, 'cause
we never used to have calls for these. It all started around New
Year's. People are frightened.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost for a 6,500-watt Honda generator that will provide
electricity for a large house is $3,400. A 1,000-watt generator
that would run a television and VCR costs $780. The little ones are
still available, but Banks said he's got 15 big ones back-ordered
and he could sell them immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Other items that are fast disappearing are radios and
flashlights that don't depend on batteries.
</P>
<P>
   A $99.95 wind-up radio from South Africa that has been on order
since January is not expected to be shipped until May, Hopkins
said.
</P>
<P>
   This minor inconvenience is just a warm-up for what some believe
lies ahead. The doomsayers predict food and fuel shortages, power
disruptions and possibly looting in the streets as those who didn't
prepare try to take advantage of those who did.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, only a fraction of the public is buying into the
idea of any kind of Y2K catastrophe. The majority of Americans are
ignoring or denying it, Hopkins said. In her opinion, the rush to
get last-minute supplies on New Year's Eve will resemble a scene
from a disaster movie.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the demand, Cheaper than Dirt has 78 telephone
operators to take orders. Once a business that catered to campers
and survivalists, Cheaper than Dirt has seen its business grow
since last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get three to six truckloads of ready-to-eat meals a week
now, compared to maybe a truckload every two weeks in the past,''
Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce and Phyllis Hopkins moved their home-based side business
out of their living room and into a 17,000-square-foot warehouse
when sales rocketed from $120,000 in 1997 to $3 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last January it started going crazy, and by May I had to quit
my job,'' Phyllis Hopkins said. ``I didn't get any sleep all night
because people were faxing things.''
</P>
<P>
   Their customers include programmers, church groups and lots of
grandmothers ordering for their families. Orders come from as far
away as Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicken Little syndrome has apparently hit hardest in
California, Washington and Texas, where many of Hopkins' customers
live.
</P>
<P>
   Most people adhere to the philosophy that the problem will be
solved by somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of the world is in denial on this,'' Hopkins said.
``Life is going to be real interesting for a while. The people who
don't do anything are going to go nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Big businesses have started to address the Y2K bug, but many
small businesses and doctors' offices are far from solving it,
Anderson said. An estimated 90 percent of doctor's offices and half
of small- to medium-sized businesses have yet to address the
computer problem, according to a U.S. Senate committee report on
compliance. And 64 percent of hospitals, most of them small, have
no plans to test their Y2K efforts simply because they can't afford
to, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of lack of access to medical facilities has led some
proponents to push people to stock up on prescription and
over-the-counter drugs and other emergency supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have said the best way to prepare is to
have enough food on hand to last several days, enough cash to last
the holiday weekend and at least a half-tank of gas in the car.
Fortunately, the technology in most cars is not sensitive to the
Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   In the event that someone has to go without food for a while,
there are survival tabs available that provide protein to sustain
essential body tissues. They cost $27 for 180, enough to last two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Just how long the Y2K crisis might last is debatable. While many
predict it will never happen, others are stocking up for an entire
year.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is among those who believe that people have nothing to
lose by hoarding food that they can always eat or share with
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a downside to preparing for emergencies,'' she
said.

BRADLEY EMERGES AS NO. 1 ALTERNATIVE TO GORE

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey likes to
tell audiences that in 1988 he looked at himself in the mirror and
said, ``You're not ready.'' He decided not to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, he says, ``there was something inside me that
said, `No. Don't do this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But by last fall, he recalls, he looked in the mirror again and
told himself: ``I'm at the top of my game. I'm going to run for
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Only months ago, many Democrats questioned Bradley's timing.
They argued that he passed up his best chance in 1992 _ and that
trying to triumph over an incumbent vice president was a quixotic,
even foolhardy, exercise.
</P>
<P>
   But now, largely because of circumstances that Bradley had
nothing to do with, few political professionals dismiss his
prospects outright, even as they concede that Vice President Al
Gore remains the clear favorite for the nomination. That is because
Bradley has already captured the prize for which nearly a dozen
contenders on the Republican side are arduously competing: to
emerge as the alternative should Gore falter.
</P>
<P>
   The parade of other Democrats who had planned to take on Gore
has evaporated, leaving a simple dynamic. If Gore does not get the
nomination, Bradley does. Never before in a modern-day contest for
an open White House has the competition been distilled to two
people so early.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Al Gore and I, one-on-one, for 11 months,'' said Bradley,
who is as much known as a basketball star at Princeton University
and for the New York Knicks as for his 18 years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   As the only alternative to Gore, Bradley is in a much stronger
position than he would have been had other Democrats, including
Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, Sen.
Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, and Jesse Jackson, not bailed out. He
will automatically draw all of the negative vote from those people
who dislike Gore or President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley will command far more attention from the press, and
from voters. On Tuesday, for instance, he plans to highlight his
long interest in race relations with a speech in New York that will
in part address the case of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed West African
immigrant who was shot and killed by city police officers. It is
the latest attempt by Bradley to promote so-called ``big ideas'' to
contrast himself with small-bore initiatives advanced by Gore, like
combating local traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who decided not to challenge Gore, said
Bradley has the potential to win the nomination. ``Any time there's
only two people in the race there's a possibility,'' he said.
``Bradley has two things people like: He was a good basketball
player and he's smart. If he adds a third one, that he's a leader,
he'll be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an enviable political perch: As the early favorite, Gore
faces pressure not only to prevail in the early contests, but also
to win overwhelmingly. Even if Bradley gains a respectable
percentage of the vote but ultimately loses, he can still win
plaudits as a dragon slayer who came close to toppling an incumbent
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bradley has yet to prove that he is the best candidate to
make the most of the one-on-one dynamic. The reality is that Gore's
weaknesses are not necessarily Bradley's strengths. Both are known
as more cerebral, even shy, than back-slapping politicians. Both
are often less-than-compelling orators. And it is difficult to
decipher any momentous issue differences between the two, beyond
that Bradley opposed the administration's welfare reform measure.
He feared that it would force mothers to abandon their children for
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's reputation as somewhat plodding is sometimes evident
in his campaign speeches. In a talk to contributors in Palm Beach,
Fla., recently, he hardly sounded convincing when he said, ``Now,
the question is, `Can you win?' And the answer is, `Absolutely.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he came alive at a Democratic Party convention in
Manchester, N.H., earlier this month when he delighted the
audience, and underscored his appeal as a celebrity, with tales
from his basketball days. He also puts forth a personal side.
Everywhere he goes, he says he is thankful that he did not run in
1992 because his wife, Ernestine, was diagnosed that year with
breast cancer and has since recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Though at 6-foot-5 Bradley looks a bit awkward loping about,
mingling with voters, his admirers often walk away from him with
the same response: He is more charming than they expected, and
would be a clean break from the scandalous Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Bradley said he doubted that those who
questioned his campaigning skills ``have ever been out with me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on the road for 30 years,'' he said, ``and all those
years I've either been performing in short pants, campaigning for
people or earning money on the road. Now I'm out campaigning for
the presidency, and it's the ultimate exhilaration.''
</P>
<P>
   Insisting that the contest was serious business for him, Bradley
said, ``I don't get into it unless I can see my way through to 270,
which are the electoral votes needed to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's biggest arguments for why voters should turn to him
are that he has had a more varied life experience than Gore, who
was the son of a senator, and more ambitious ideas. ``I had a life
before I got into politics,'' he tells audiences.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters also emphasize that Bradley has a
long-established reputation as championing campaign reform, and
that his ethics have never been questioned. That, they say, would
make a pointed contrast to the Clinton years and the questions that
have been raised about Gore's efforts to raise money in the 1996
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bradley, who retired from the Senate in 1996, has yet
to put forward many specifics about what he would do as president.
He has been reluctant, for example, to spell out how the
administration should be handling the most pressing matter of the
day: the crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers, already devising arguments to undermine their
competitor, say that it is disingenuous for Bradley, who is 55, to
cast himself as a Washington outsider because he was a senator a
decade longer than the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore advisers were clearly unnerved that Bradley collected
$4.3 million in the first three months of the year, an impressive
sum even though it did not approach the $8.9 million amassed by
Gore in the same period. The fact that Gore has an opponent has
also prompted him to display his political might by taking steps
like staging a formal endorsement with Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has nowhere near the endorsements or the vast staff of
the Gore organization. Not one member of Congress, not even from
New Jersey, has publicly signed on to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bradley has assembled a skilled staff, including many
longtime advisers, although they still seem to be struggling with
the unexpected demands placed upon the second candidate in a
two-person matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting that he was well aware of, but unfazed by Gore's
institutional advantages, Bradley offers a sweeping, yet rather
vague, explanation for how he can prevail: ``Ultimately, the people
decide these elections and they decide them on the basis of who's
speaking to their lives and who do they feel is speaking most
clearly about the future of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's unexpected position as an underdog to be reckoned with
is in part an outgrowth of Gore's miscalculations. Though the vice
president shrewdly scared off potential rivals who were intimidated
by his seeming invincibility, he did not take Bradley's intentions
as seriously as he did the others.
</P>
<P>
   Early polls show that Gore's support is quite shallow and that
Bradley has gained significant ground in the polls in recent weeks,
though he remains far behind Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley strategy is founded on the premise that voters in
the two most pivotal early contests, the Iowa caucuses and the New
Hampshire primary, sometimes pride themselves on being contrary and
do not always reward the expected winner. Bradley hopes he will
emerge in one or both of those early contests. He is also wooing
independent voters and even Republicans, with some success, judging
by the turnout at various events.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Schnitzer, a New Jersey resident who calls himself ``a
snowbird'' because he spends his winters in Florida, said at a
Bradley event in Palm Beach that he opposes Gore because ``he's a
little too much in the Clinton image.'' But, he said, he is worried
that beyond the mid-Atlantic states, Bradley may strike voters as
``too Eastern, too liberal, too intellectual.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers dismiss Bradley as the Gary Hart of 2000. In the
1984 Democratic primaries, Hart, at the time a Colorado senator,
emerged as the alternative to former Vice President Walter F.
Mondale, and, like Bradley, portrayed himself as the thoughtful
candidate with big ideas. Hart jolted the Democratic Party by
winning the New Hampshire primary, but his candidacy imploded when
he was accused of adultery. Mondale recovered the momentum with a
heavy advertising campaign and by posing this question about Hart's
vaunted ideas: ``Where's the beef?''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's advisers contend that because of the newly
compressed primary schedule in 2000, a victory in Iowa or New
Hampshire will make him unstoppable as the race turns quickly to
big states like California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gore maintains his standing, Bradley probably can't do
anything,'' said John Haskell, a professor of political science at
Drake University in Des Moines. ``But if the economy went bad, or
if you get lucky in some primary _ Gore makes a stupid mistake _ it
can really snowball because of the front-loaded primaries.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though Gore has established far more extensive organizations,
Bradley has the advantage of being able to campaign full time _ and
without being captive to Air Force 2 and other trappings _ which
can be important in early states where one-on-one contact with
voters is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulty Gore faces now in Iowa and New Hampshire is
that these are both states where he has never really campaigned on
his own behalf before and there's an inherent need in those
constituencies to see him up closer in a more retail way,'' said
William Carrick, a veteran Democratic strategist. ``Obviously,
that's easier for Bradley to do than for Gore. You're hearing
rumblings that Bradley's doing well _ but it's easier for him to
get out and touch people.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard part, Carrick noted, is advancing from No. 1
alternative to the nominee. ``We have a history of the process
producing significant and serious challenges to the established
front-runner,'' he said. ``But it's a 50-50 thing whether they win
or not.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, over lunch in Palo Alto, Calif., where Bradley was a
fellow at Stanford University, he recalled what he did not miss
about his old job: ``Who needed to be stroked? Who needed to be
called? Who needed to be reasoned with? Who in the press were our
allies? Who were our enemies? How do we convince four or five
people on the other side you need to have to make something really
go. It's just a different time.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked then whether he had the stomach or endurance to dive back
into the most competitive political arena of all, he shrugged and
said, ``Who knows? Who knows?''

WITH LITTLE FANFARE, GERMAN PARLIAMENT RETURNS TO BERLIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ With solemnity but little pomp, and with Europe at war
in the Balkans, Germany returned its parliament to the Reichstag
Monday, 66 years after a fire there ushered in Hitler's
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   The first session in the renovated Reichstag, now topped with a
glass dome to symbolize the political transparency on which Germany
has based its postwar revival, marked the dawn of the ``Berlin
Republic,'' a phrase dear to Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, but one
he insists will bring no fundamental changes in German policy.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the parliament Monday, Schroeder, a Social Democrat,
said that to equate the word ``Reich,'' or ``empire,'' with
``Reichstag'' would be ``as senseless as equating Berlin with
Prussian glory and German centralism.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on, ``The federative model of German politics is
well-established and in no way endangered.''
</P>
<P>
   With its many ghosts _ of imperialism, fascism, communism and
division _ Berlin has stirred some old fears that its periods as a
German capital are synonymous with disaster. The chancellor
appeared concerned to allay any such concerns, saying it was the
success of ``Bonn democracy'' that ``makes the Berlin Republic
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder spoke in a 669-member chamber of striking informality,
evidently designed to counter any imperial nostalgia that the
massive stone edifice begun under Bismarck might kindle.
</P>
<P>
   Gray carpets, simple mauve seats, low public galleries, and the
glass cupola and big windows give a feeling of accessible
ordinariness. Hovering over the proceedings is the pudgy eagle
known affectionately as ``the fat hen'' that adorned the parliament
in Bonn, retained after several leaner models more suggestive of
Prussian virility were rejected.
</P>
<P>
   No national anthem was played, and no thumping rhetoric
delivered, as speaker after speaker emphasized that the
westward-looking democratic values that have anchored Germany's
postwar rebirth and then unification in 1990 would remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitivity about the move back to Berlin has been heightened by
the fact that the first session in a building touched by so many of
this century's conflicts took place as war raged in the Balkans
with German planes taking part in NATO attacks on Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder did not directly refer to the violence, but said he
was convinced that a united Germany, assuming new political
responsibilities after its long postwar tutelage, must be prepared
to fight for ``a Europe of human rights that does not exclude
anybody on our continent.''
</P>
<P>
   To applause, he quoted the Albanian writer, Ismail Kadare: ``The
Balkans is the yard of the European house, and in no house can
peace prevail so long as people kill each other in its yard.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ludger Volmer, a deputy foreign minister, echoed growing
uneasiness in his environmentalist Green Party, the junior member
of Schroeder's governing coalition. ``We are initiating our Berlin
Republic in the midst of a European war,'' he said, ``and I am one
of the people responsible for a policy that leaves me no reason to
be optimistic or happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Volmer
added: ``We failed in our first goal of bombing Milosevic back to
the negotiating table within two or three days, and we failed to
stop a genocide in Kosovo. Now we must persevere, but the outlook
is not encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Gila Altmann, a Green and a deputy environment
minister, added her signature to a petition for a cease-fire
already signed by about 1,000 Green Party members. These divisions
in the party are putting pressure on Joschka Fischer, the Green
foreign minister, although his support in the country has risen
since the bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the crisis in the Balkans, the overriding symbolism
Monday was of European and German reconciliation. The first sitting
came almost exactly a decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall,
which the Reichstag abutted during its long postwar hibernation.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting a symbolic key to the Reichstag, Wolfgang Thierse, the
speaker of the parliament and a man who grew up in Communist East
Germany, stood in bright sunshine beneath the old inscription ``Dem
Deutschen Volke''' _ ``To the German People.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the words, betrayed by those who repeatedly trampled the
democratic aspirations of Germany in this century, symbolized the
grave responsibilities of every member of parliament on a day when
``all doubts are set aside, all resistance overcome, all problems
solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder took a somewhat more somber view, noting that every
sixth Berliner is unemployed and suggesting that the special role
of Berlin would lie in overcoming the lingering mistrust between
the eastern and western parts of the country and so completing the
unification of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as Bonn stands for the western part of the republic,
Berlin symbolizes a united Germany,'' he said. He accused ``a
sheltered generation'' of westerners of arrogance in criticizing
easterners without asking, ``What would we have done under similar
conditions?''
</P>
<P>
   Growing support from the eastern part of the country was
critical to Schroeder's victory in elections last year, and he has
made the struggle against high unemployment in formerly communist
areas a central plank of his government's program. Up to now,
results have been modest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Reichstag, which was completed in 1894, was a center of war
propaganda during World War I, the parliament of the Weimar
Republic and the site of a Nazi exhibition in 1938 on ``The Eternal
Jew.'' After the war, the border between the British- and
Soviet-occupied sectors ran through its damaged masonry.
</P>
<P>
   It has been restored at a cost of about $330 million by the
British architect Sir Norman Foster, who said Monday that the
``openness, fairness and resolution'' with which the project was
completed said much about the qualities of German society.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the major architectural projects in Berlin have been
entrusted to foreign architects, causing some grumbling here. The
decision clearly reflects the great sensitivity of architecture in
a city where Hitler's architect, Albert Speer, laid out elaborate
plans for ``Germania'', the planned capital of the 1,000-year
Reich.
</P>
<P>
   After the inaugural session, the members of parliament and
Schroeder moved upstairs for a jolly reception, at which an oompah
band performed as meatballs, smoked salmon sandwiches and beer were
consumed with evident relish.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was extremely relaxed and low key, very much
Prussia-lite. ``Behind its monstrous dress, what we now have inside
the Reichstag is a rather modest woman,'' remarked Michael Naumann,
the state minister for culture.

 &HT;    CNN, Arnett part ways
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ CNN severed relations Monday with Peter Arnett, one of
the network's brightest stars during the Persian Gulf War and later
its most controversial for his role in the Operation Tailwind
fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1966 for his reporting for
The Associated Press in Vietnam and who is recognized by his
colleagues as one of the greatest war correspondents of the
television age, was tarnished when he reported the Operation
Tailwind story, charging that the United States used nerve gas in
Laos in 1970. CNN then retracted the story in the biggest
embarrassment in its history.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett, 64, did not return telephone calls seeking comment
Monday. He was quoted in USA Today, before his departure was
announced, as calling CNN's treatment of him ``pretty shabby.''
Later on Monday, Arnett was quoted in a CNN statement as saying,
``I've had a long and wonderful relationship with CNN and have been
proud to be part of this great news organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The terse news release stated that CNN and Arnett had ``reached
an understanding that will bring Arnett's 18-year service to an
amicable conclusion.'' He had been in the middle of a five-year
contract, with a window of negotiation coming in July.
</P>
<P>
   CNN International President Eason Jordan, to whom Arnett
reported, declined to comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While Tailwind may not have been the only cause of Arnett's
dismissal _ there were indications from within CNN Monday that
salary and other issues were involved _ it's unthinkable that the
network would have ended his contract now had it not been for
Tailwind.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett was reprimanded by the network for his role as reporter
of the Tailwind story, which aired last June as the first
installment of the TV newsmagazine ``NewsStand.'' The report,
stating that U.S. military personnel used nerve gas in Laos in
1970, was soon attacked by the military.
</P>
<P>
   Besides retracting the story and reprimanding Arnett, CNN fired
two producers and allowed one executive to resign. The network has
since settled, for hundreds of thousands of dollars, at least two
lawsuits by veterans involved in Tailwind alleging defamation of
character, and at least two more suits are pending.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much Arnett contributed to the Tailwind story became a
source of controversy. He said at the time that he was responsible
for ``not one comma,'' and producers April Oliver and Jack Smith
acknowledged that they were the prime movers of the story, which
they maintain is true.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a gutsy reporter who has an incredible track record,''
Oliver said Monday from her home in Virginia. ``The military made
it clear that they wanted his head and it appears now CNN has given
it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one military man was glad at the news about Arnett:
Maj. Gen. Perry Smith, the former CNN military analyst (now with
NBC) who resigned over Tailwind and pushed the network to
apologize.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have any credibility left,'' Smith said Monday,
from Augusta, where he lives. ``Why he was not fired last summer
amazes me. It's taken awhile, but at least it's finally
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People looked at me as a role model,'' Arnett said last year,
shortly after being reprimanded by CNN. ``They couldn't understand
how a role model could be involved in such a sorry episode as this.
My journalistic principles were bent, but they're intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnett's role in Tailwind eventually came to overshadow the rest
of his career as a war correspondent. After he said he had narrated
the piece as a good ``company man'' but had not researched it, CNN
correspondent Christiane Amanpour, wrote a blistering op-ed piece
for The New York Times, attacking Arnett.
</P>
<P>
   But the incident displayed a key part of the TV newsmagazine
culture: that producers and researchers generally do all the
legwork, and the ``name'' correspondent usually comes in at the
last minute to do some interviews and narrate. After Tailwind, the
broadcast networks all went on record as saying that never again
would a correspondent on a challenged report be able to say he or
she was just a narrator.
</P>
<P>
   And some of Arnett's colleagues, aware that he had been caught
in a bad situation not entirely of his own making, stuck up for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never met anybody who had more respect for Peter Arnett
and his lifetime achievement as a reporter,'' CBS News anchor Dan
Rather said at a meeting with TV critics earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett was hired by CNN in 1981 when the network was still
disparaged by most professional journalists. ``Not only was he a
solid reporter, but he was valuable in terms of showing we were
serious about what we were doing,'' said Ed Turner, a former key
vice president at CNN.
</P>
<P>
   There was no doubt that the 18-year CNN veteran was
conspicuously absent from his network's coverage of the war in
Yugoslavia, though he had covered Yugoslav conflicts several times
from 1994 to 1997. Arnett told The New York Times he had asked CNN
to send him to Yugoslavia, but some CNN executives reportedly
believed that he continued to be tainted by Tailwind.
</P>
<P>
   ``His work will stand in the hall of great reporters. I think
the body of his work will survive the unfortunate concllusion that
occurred here,'' said Turner, now president of the Forum Network, a
public affairs cable network.

ASIA'S STOCK MARKETS ARE RISING AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Stock markets from Seoul to Singapore soared Monday,
extending a rally that many analysts here say is proof that foreign
investors are returning in large numbers to the recession-ravaged
economies of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something fundamental is happening,'' said Miron Mushkat, the
head of global economics and strategy at Indocam Asia Asset
Management in Hong Kong. ``The markets are telling us that the
Asian crisis is over. We are moving from deeply dark territory into
the land of the light.''
</P>
<P>
   The euphoria was most pronounced on the Jakarta Stock Exchange
in Indonesia, where shares jumped 6 percent. But the gains were
impressive throughout the region: 5.7 percent in Seoul, South
Korea; 5.5 percent in Manila, the Philippines; 4.1 percent in
Singapore; 2.7 percent in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and 2.2 percent
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The Nikkei index in Tokyo was the only exception, falling 1.1
percent after a string of powerful gains last week.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the general sense of a better tomorrow, analysts said
several factors were driving the rally. Asian governments have
aggressively cut interest rates; on Monday the Philippines cut
rates for the 10th time this year. Foreign-fund managers are
steering more money to the region, in part because technology
stocks in the United States have lost some of their appeal after
troubles at Compaq Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people shift out of technology stocks, they tend to look
at cyclical stocks and overseas opportunities,'' said Marc Faber,
managing director of Marc Faber Ltd., an investment firm in Hong
Kong. ``People do feel that the crisis in emerging economies
worldwide is over.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally in Asian stock markets is all the more remarkable
because it bears no relation to the underlying health of the
economies. In Hong Kong, for example, the government announced
Monday that unemployment reached a record rate of 6.2 percent in
the three months from January through March.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, the Hang Seng index roared past the 13,000 level
before closing at 12,766. The Hang Seng, which has risen 17 percent
just this month, has regained all the ground lost since it crashed
in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors said they were alarmed by this performance
because it could lull government officials and business executives
into thinking the hard times were over. With money pouring into
Asia, some analysts predict that efforts toward fundamental
economic changes could bog down in Indonesia, Thailand and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a once-in-a-blue-moon opportunity to sort out Asia,''
said Bill Kaye, the senior managing director of the Pacific Group,
an asset-management firm in Hong Kong. ``But here we are, back to
the races.''
</P>
<P>
   Faber said, ``The big problem with falling interest rates and
surging liquidity is that it lessens the incentives to pursue deep
reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Indonesia recently took steps to clean up its insolvent
banking system, the restructuring process has been extremely slow
in Malaysia and Thailand. In Hong Kong, the robust market belies an
economy that has failed to reduce costs, despite a reduction in
costs of rival economies like Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that shares in Seoul rose Monday because of hopes
that South Korea's largest conglomerates were finally reducing
their bloated operations. The leaders of LG Group and Hyundai
Group, for example, met Monday to discuss plans for a subsidiary of
Hyundai to acquire LG's electronics unit, LG Semicon.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are not the only people expressing a belief that the
worst is over in Asia. The Asian Development Bank said Monday that
the economic downturn had hit bottom, and it predicted that the
region would return to economic growth this year.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual report issued in Manila, the president of the
bank, Tadao Chino, said: ``I believe the worst of the financial
crisis is over. This gives us reason to expect that 1999 will see
notable improvements in economic performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The development bank predicted that Asia, excluding Japan, would
grow at an average annual rate of 4.4 percent in 1999 and 5.1
percent in 2000. That compares with 2.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Though the performance of Asian stock markets is impressive,
analysts pointed out two caveats.
</P>
<P>
   First, the volume of trading on some markets _ notably Jakarta _
is much smaller than it was before the crisis. So a relatively
small infusion of capital can cause a large percentage increase.
</P>
<P>
   Second, investors are aggressively buying shares in major public
companies like HSBC Holdings, the parent of Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corp., which hit an all-time high of $284 (Hong Kong), or
$36.64 (U.S.), before closing at $280 (Hong Kong), or $36.12
(U.S.). But that does not mean that money is flowing to the small
and medium-size companies, the backbone of many Asian countries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There is this disconnect between the large-cap stocks and the
carnage of small companies down below,'' said John Pinkel, a
partner at Shaw, Kwei &AMP; Partners Ltd., a Hong Kong fund that
invests in smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   For all the caveats, however, forecasters do not see an end to
the rally soon. As the sentiment about Asia improves, more fund
managers in the United States and Europe are expected to divert
capital to these markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to predict anything when we make these
qualitative leaps,'' Mushkat said. ``Our year-end target for the
Hang Seng was 12,000, which seems rather irrelevant right now.''

COUPLE SUES CITY OF HOUSTON AFTER DOGS MISTAKENLY PUT TO SLEEP 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A couple whose two pedigree golden retrievers were
mistakenly euthanized by the city's animal control department in
September has sued the city for an unspecified amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about money,'' said Pam Beckert, who filed the
state district lawsuit late last week with her husband, Donald
Beckert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never got an apology from anybody, and they never answered
our questions as to how this happened,'' she said Monday. ``We hope
this will make some difference and hopefully it won't happen to
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beckerts claim in their lawsuit that the city's Bureau of
Animal Regulation and Care violated its policy by putting the dogs
to sleep within hours after they were picked up in the Kingwood
area of Houston on Sept. 4. According to city guidelines, stray
dogs are supposed to be kept for at least three days before being
euthanized.
</P>
<P>
   The Beckerts also assert in the lawsuit that they repeatedly
called the animal control department from Sept. 4-8 and were
wrongly told the dogs had not been picked up.
</P>
<P>
   The Beckerts' attorney, Gary Polland, said he doesn't know the
monetary amount his clients will seek, but under state law the
maximum they could get by suing the city is $250,000,
</P>
<P>
   City officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs, 8-year-old Christi and 6-year-old Duncan, 6, slipped
out of the Beckerts' yard on Sept. 4 shortly after receiving a
bath. Their collars had not been put back on since they were still
wet.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor spotted the dogs and placed them in her yard and then
called the animal control department to have them picked up because
she did not have time to look for the owners, the lawsuit said. The
neighbor, who was leaving for the Labor Day Weekend, could not wait
for animal control officials to arrive at her house, so she faxed
them permission to enter her yard and retrieve the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Animal control officials apparently thought the woman who called
them was the owner and that she wanted them euthanized. Since the
dogs were not considered strays, animal control officials did not
have to wait three days before euthanizing them.
</P>
<P>
   Under city guidelines, people who request that their dogs be
euthanized must sign affidavits of ownership. The neighbor never
signed such an affidavit, Kathy Barton, spokeswoman for the city
Health and Human Services Department, which oversees animal
control, said in September. This requirement is sometimes waived if
the owner is under duress.
</P>
<P>
   Barton said at the time she doubted that the animal control
department would continue to allow such waivers in light of what
happened to the Beckerts' dogs.
</P>
<P>
   But the couple's attorney said Monday he doesn't think the city
has changed any euthanization procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Beckert said the dogs _ which she calls her ``first
children'' because she and her husband acquired them before any of
their three children were born _ are greatly missed.
</P>
<P>
   She said her 5-year-old daughter constantly asks about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell her they went to doggy heaven,'' Pam Beckert said.

KOSOVO'S FACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The faces of Kosovo refugees put life swiftly into perspective.
Arriving each morning on the front page of the newspaper, they
stare up from the breakfast table to challenge the daily whine.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone sweating a deadline at work or feeling stressed about
car-pooling the kids or in a fury because the laundry hamper is
full and the sock drawer is empty can feel the complaint dry up and
drop back down the throat before the silent anguish and exhaustion
in so many photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a cup of freshly brewed coffee in the secure familiarity
of a warm kitchen, a person tries to imagine the troops breaking
down the door, the snarled two-hour warning, the panic of decision
about what few things can go along on the escape route over the
snowy mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the danger, one might be tempted to hang on to the
concept of home for as long as possible and can understand how a
young man would stay behind because, as his father later explained
to a reporter in a Macedonia refugee camp: ``He did not want to
leave the cows.''
</P>
<P>
   Leave the cat, the dog, the wedding pictures, the quilt, the
violin, the threads of life sewn for generations? More than half a
million Kosovars nodded numbly in the affirmative this year to
travel the ageless journey of the displaced. That journey resonates
deep within the American psyche even though most Americans
experience such a trek only through photos, old and new, or through
stories passed down by relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Government-run Serbian media do not show the evocative faces of
forced migration, so Serbian citizens don't see the daily parade of
human misery in the news. The politics of ``ethnic cleansing''
insists on rendering a people invisible, obliterating their names
along with their homes.
</P>
<P>
   But the refugees are piercingly and appropriately visible here.
The creased, dusty faces draw us into the desperation behind barbed
wire and under tent flaps. The eyes register fear and hope as they
stare into the middle distance, as if trying to focus on a sane
future. We follow the gaze and hope they find it.

   PRINCETON, N.J. _ As he pulled up the charts one after another
on his office computer, Alan Krueger grew enthusiastic. Children do
better all through their schooling, he declared, if by fourth-grade
they have spent just one year in a class of only 15 students. The
tall green bars and rising red lines on Krueger's charts told the
story in simple-to-understand detail. Poor children in particular
are helped by early attention from a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small classes later on may have less impact,'' Krueger said,
rehearsing the punch line of a speech he would give a few days
later. ``I infer that very young children become socialized in a
small class. They learn how to behave in school. They are more
likely to take the SAT exams in high school, and to earn more later
as workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Empirical economists talk that way, as if each finding is a
nugget of fresh, significant insight. Many are. No group within the
profession is challenging accepted wisdom more vigorously. But
Krueger does so rather cautiously. For all his enthusiasm, he is
reluctant to prescribe small classes as national policy without
more research.
</P>
<P>
   There is a reason for his hesitation. Empirical economists may
be increasingly pressing theorists, but abstract thinkers still
dominate academic economics with their explanations of how people
and markets behave. Theory, for example, says that employment
should fall when the minimum wage rises, but empiricists have
uncovered exceptions. And for all the profession's emphasis on
education as the key to higher earnings, economic theory fails to
provide a blueprint for improving learning. Empiricists are trying
to fill the breach with studies like Krueger's.
</P>
<P>
   Many are less than a decade out of graduate school, which makes
Krueger, a 38-year-old Princeton University professor and the
editor of the prestigious Journal of Economic Perspectives, already
an elder statesman of the growing empirical movement. It is
bringing to economics what amounts to a reality check.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theory is being forced to be much more specific,'' said George
Akerlof, a theorist at the Brookings Institution who, like some
others of similar bent, is now doing more empirical work. ``The
whole intention of empirical economics is to force theory down to
earth.''
</P>
<P>
   And the profession is paying heed. The John Bates Clark Medal,
awarded by the American Economic Association every two years to an
outstanding economist in his 30s, has gone to empirical economists
the last two times. In 1995, the winner was David Card, a frequent
collaborator of Krueger's, and in 1997 to Kevin Murphy at the
University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger is frequently mentioned as a candidate for this year's
award, to be selected this month. So is Andrei Shleifer of Harvard,
a Russian-born empiricist, whose specialty is the study of
financial markets operating in different legal and political
settings. There are other possibilities as well for perhaps the
most prestigious award in economics short of the Nobel.
</P>
<P>
   Empirical economists test a theory or a belief by coming up with
just the right data or observations. Krueger likens the process to
medical research, where a drug is the equivalent of a theory or
belief and the empirical work is the testing among thousands of
people, some of whom get the drug and some a placebo. He came to
his conclusions about class size after tapping into a Tennessee
study of 11,600 children who had been placed randomly in small or
large classes.
</P>
<P>
   Public schools might work just fine if tax money were channeled
to the right programs, like small classes for very young students,
says Krueger, whose mother and wife are public school teachers, and
whose two children attend a public elementary school here. So why
doesn't he campaign for such reforms?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask, `Why am I cautious,' there are two reasons,'' he
said, talking across the wide, curved desk in his sunny office.
``The strength of a researcher is not in being an advocate, but in
making scientific judgments based on the evidence. And empirical
research teaches us that nothing is known with certainty _ even the
class-size results, which seem so definitive.''
</P>
<P>
   That reluctance is at odds with Krueger's public profile. A
Democrat, he served as chief economist at the Labor Department in
1994 and 1995. The journal he edits has a circulation of 25,500,
making it the most widely read in the profession. He pumps out
half-a-dozen research papers a year, a considerable pace in
economics, and travels every other week to seminars and
conferences. ``What I like to do is give the data its own voice,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, however, Krueger is asked for recommendations. What,
his audiences want to know, should be done? That's when he balks.
He is not in the business of making value judgments, he insists.
Once economists get caught up in value judgments, they become
reluctant to accept the findings of their own research when the
findings contradict their beliefs. ``Astronomy was plagued until
the 16th century,'' he said, ``by value judgments about the
centrality of man.''
</P>
<P>
   So he declines to advocate President Clinton's proposal to spend
$12 billion to reduce class size nationwide. Convincing as it
seems, the Tennessee experiment, started in 1986, is not
sufficient, he says. Further research is needed involving at least
12 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economics has to construct theory very slowly, block by
block,'' he said. ``There is no other choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Krueger's cautiousness represents one strong faction of
empirical economics. Edward Leamer, at the University of California
at Los Angeles, belongs to another, less diffident group. He
insists that theory and findings be yoked together, early on.
</P>
<P>
   Leamer studies the impact of trade on American wages. His thesis
is that there is an impact, one broader and more complicated than
standard theory has acknowledged. An apparel worker, for example,
driven from his job by cheap imports, may seek work as a waiter or
warehouse hand, perhaps driving down wages in those fields. A few
years later, apparel imports decline, but Japanese machinery
imports rise and machinery workers accept a wage freeze. The impact
on wages continues, with different evidence.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Economics is so theory-driven,'' Leamer said, ``that until you
have a theory that explains your findings, people will retain the
old theory. You need new theory to drive out old theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Krueger resists that lesson, but he is still reeling from it. So
is Card, now at the University of California at Berkeley. A
minimum-wage study they did in the early 1990s, while Card was at
Princeton, has brought them much more notoriety than they ever
anticipated. They found an eye-catching exception to the theory
that employment falls when the minimum wage rises.
</P>
<P>
   The study was very much in character for Krueger, who has a
knack for spotting what empiricists call ``natural experiments,''
where chance circumstances usually create the experimental
variables. (In laboratories, in contrast, scientists can control
the variables much more precisely.) Card, for instance, now wants
to study what happens when affirmative action is eliminated, as it
has been at the University of California. Krueger came up with a
question that can be answered empirically: What are the best black
students doing, turning to universities elsewhere or still
enrolling in California?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at my curriculum vitae, you will find more papers
that no one has read than in Alan's, 10 to 1,'' Card said. ``He
does not waste time on research he does not consider important and
practical.''
</P>
<P>
   Their minimum-wage research, initiated in the late 1980s, soon
after Krueger got his Ph.D. at Harvard and came to Princeton as an
assistant professor, seemed important to both of them. Their first
studies involved California. But when New Jersey in 1992 raised its
minimum to $5.05 an hour from $4.25, they jumped at the opportunity
for a natural experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Entrenched theory holds that supply and demand tend to balance
each other. When the minimum wage rises enough, as it did in New
Jersey, then demand among employers for minimum-wage workers
declines. So when Krueger and Card surveyed fast-food restaurants
in New Jersey, compared them with nearby Pennsylvania, where the
minimum was unchanged, and found no impact on employment, there was
an uproar.
</P>
<P>
   They published their study in 1994, just as Krueger started at
the Labor Department, where his boss, Robert Reich, was pushing for
an increase in the minimum wage, later enacted. Card-Krueger, as
they came to be known, were accused by some economists of shoddy
research for a political goal and blithe disregard for theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't root their findings in existing theory and
research,'' says James Heckman, a University of Chicago labor
economist and empiricist. ``That is where I really deviate from
these people. Each day you can wake up with a brand-new world, not
plugged into the previous literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Krueger and Card have reaffirmed their minimum-wage findings.
They insist that what happened in New Jersey could be explained
without upending supply-and-demand theory. Special circumstances
played a role. The New Jersey minimum had been unusually low.
Employers found they could fill vacancies more easily at the higher
wage, and employee turnover fell, two cost savings. Another wage
increase might indeed reduce employment, Krueger says.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his caution, standard theory is no longer the same
in his eyes. ``We tested the supply-and-demand curve,'' he said,
``and it needs to be amended.''
</P>
<P>
   Empirical economics blossomed in the mid-20th century, feeding
on the growing quantities of economic data the government collected
and the new polls that explored consumer attitudes and behavior.
``There was this outpouring of data in the '50s and '60s, and then
it became dangerous, all these numbers and not enough theory to
organize them,'' said.
</P>
<P>
   Theory, with its emphasis on abstract, mathematical modeling,
took command by the 1960s. Only in the last decade has empirical
economics gradually regained a footing, first in labor economics
and then in finance, education and trade. Computers make the data
easier to process.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, nearly half the articles in economics
journals dealt with empirical research, up from 27 percent in 1960,
one study showed.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger grew up in Livingston, N.J., where his father, an
accountant, still practices. His mother taught first grade in
nearby East Orange. ``The Worldly Philosophers,'' Robert
Heilbroner's tales of the great economists, first aroused his
interest. But he followed his sister, Barbara, to Cornell and
enrolled in its School of Industrial and Labor Relations, thinking
he would become a lawyer. ``It seemed like what people went into,''
he said, ``and I had seen the movie `Norma Rae.'''
</P>
<P>
   His goal soon changed. As research for a paper, he found himself
analyzing data on productivity and wages, a typical empirical
inquiry. He took to the statistical detective work. From Cornell he
went on to Harvard, earning a doctorate in economics in 1987.
Within weeks of graduation, he had landed at Princeton, thanks to a
chance encounter with Orley Ashenfelter, a Princeton labor
economist.
</P>
<P>
   There he soon fell in with Card, forming one of the more
enduring collaborations in economics. It is a collaboration, as
Ashenfelter put it, that ``reports results neither man had
anticipated beforehand.''

GRAND DESIGN IN UTAH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America's Western landscape is a unique natural asset, dazzling
in its grandeur and fragile despite its massive structures,
vulnerable to intrusions that disrupt wildlife, terrain, and the
simple quality of unspoiled vistas. A good program for protecting
such lands by designating them as wilderness areas has already
helped a lot. It should be extended to other areas in need of a
shield against desecration.
</P>
<P>
   Utah is a dramatic case in point. The Southern Utah Wilderness
Alliance has been engaged in a diligent cataloging of that state's
terrain to nominate it for congressional designation as wilderness.
Hundreds of volunteers have assembled photos, descriptions, and
other data that document 9.1 million acres of wilderness, according
to Tom Price, an alliance spokesman. The federal Bureau of Land
Management, which designates candidate areas, conducted a
preliminary survey in 1991 that identified 3.7 million acres, and a
second survey raised the figure to 5.8 million _ certainly a
minimum number for Congress to endorse.
</P>
<P>
   The task will not be easy. The Utah congressional delegation,
dismayed by what it sees as loss of economic potential in areas
that include coal, gas, oil, timber, and minerals, is hostile to
the idea. Congress has been loath to add at all to the 104 million
acres (less than 5 percent of total US land area) that have been
approved over the past 35 years. All of the land involved is
federally owned and can be regarded as the property of the entire
population.
</P>
<P>
   Wilderness designation is a rigorous preservation status.
Federal law prohibits not only conspicuously intrusive activities
like mining and oil drilling but the construction of roads and
dwellings or the use of all-terrain vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But the benefits exceed the losses. The singular qualities of
those natural wonders would be irreversibly damaged by
helter-skelter development of the kind that has reshaped other
parts of the country. Future generations will thank this one if it
guarantees the pristine qualities of these regions.

TRADE GROUP APPROVES A PENALTY IN BANANA WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The United States received the World Trade
Organization's formal approval on Monday to impose $191.4 million
in punitive tariffs on European goods in a protracted fight over
European banana imports. But the effective date of the sanctions
was still in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time in the four years the world trade group
has been in existence that such retaliation had been approved, and
only the second such retaliatory step going back to its
predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has maintained for six years that the European
Union unfairly discriminates against bananas from Latin American
countries, which are exported by U.S. companies, in favor of those
grown and exported from former European colonies, mostly in the
Caribbean. The trade group agreed with the U.S. complaint earlier
this month, although it reduced the amount of damages sought from
an original $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the European trade commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan,
said that the European Union would not appeal. But on Monday, the
Europeans' delegate here, Roderick Abbott disputed the effective
date of the sanctions, arguing that they were not retroactive to
March 3, the date the United States contended. ``It is normal that
a decision applies from the day that it was taken,'' Abbott said.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Hayes, the U.S. representative to the World Trade
Organization, disagreed and said that notice of the tariffs was to
be posted in Monday's Federal Register.
</P>
<P>
   Tariffs of 100 percent will be levied on a range of products
that includes lithographs, bed linens, German coffee makers, French
plastic handbags, cardboard packing material and lead-acid storage
batteries. The sanctions effectively double the price of the
imports and make them much harder, if not impossible, to sell in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   European and U.S. officials will meet Wednesday in an attempt to
negotiate an effective date for the sanctions, but a compromise
could be difficult. Abbott noted that the interests of the two
sides ``are diametrically opposed.''
</P>
<P>
   If the two sides cannot agree on a date, the matter would be
referred to the WTO's dispute-resolution process. But Mrs. Hayes
said the United States and the Europeans could settle the matter
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The retaliatory sanctions were the first to be imposed since
1952, when the Netherlands acted against the United States in a
dispute over dairy products. The victorious Dutch got approval to
reduce the number of metric tons of U.S. ground wheat flour they
imported.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to approving the U.S. sanctions on Monday, a
three-member arbitration panel reaffirmed the illegality of the
European Union's banana-import policy.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how or even when the Europeans will amend that
policy, but Abbott said Monday that any changes soon were unlikely,
because of European Parliament elections in June and the likelihood
that a new executive agency would not be in place in Brussels,
Belgium, until the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hayes said the ``only deadline is compliance,'' leaving the
European Union presumably in the position of paying the tariffs
until it makes its import policy acceptable.

   RINAS AIR FIELD, Albania _ Hundreds of battle-ready ground
troops of the elite 82nd Airborne Division departed American shores
Monday night for Albania to conduct ``infantry-type missions''
against Yugoslav forces in Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 members of the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment were
airlifted from the airborne division's headquarters at Fort Bragg,
N.C., as part of ``Task Force Hawk,'' the deployment of 24 Apache
attack helicopters and land-based missiles for use against Serbian
tanks and soldiers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The principle mission of the paratroopers is to provide security
for the basing of Apaches near the Kosovo border. Members of the
82nd Airborne performed a similar role as peacekeepers in Bosnia in
1996, providing security at an air base in Tuzla.
</P>
<P>
   But the statement issued Monday by an Army spokesman at Fort
Bragg announcing the departure of the paratroopers raised further
questions about whether NATO is moving closer to a ground war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our paratroopers will perform a variety of infantry-type
missions, including security,'' said Bob Coultas, spokesman for the
18th Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg. Spokesmen for the 82nd Airborne
Division declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 NATO troops are already in Albania, and Pentagon
officials have indicated that as many as 2,000 more airborne troops
could be sent there as part of Task Force Hawk. Another 6,000
ground troops are expected to help with the humanitarian relief
mission for Kosovar refugees in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are about 12,000 NATO troops in Macedonia,
including about 600 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana has repeatedly emphasized
that NATO has no plans to authorize a ground invasion of Kosovo.
But on Sunday, he significantly added to the ongoing ground troop
dialogue. ``If the moment comes when it is necessary (to invade
Yugoslavia), I'm sure the countries that belong to NATO will be
ready to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lead units of the 82nd Airborne Division arrived here Sunday
after a nine-hour flight on an Air Force transport from Fort Bragg.
They began moving out of their overnight quarters on this airfield
Monday, departing in camouflaged Humvees to points unknown along
Albania's frontier border with Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel motivated being here,'' said Army PFC Sam Cruce, 21, of
Gainesville, Ga., one of the first arrivals. ``It's pretty cool. I
never expected to be deployed out here.''
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to talk about their mission here, a squad leader,
2d Lt. Ryan Leigh, 23, of St. Cloud, Minn., said: ``It's a good
mission for America. And I am happy to be here, I'm proud to be
here. We are doing the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how many troops of the 82d were on their way to
Albania, a captain answered with two words: ``A bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon on Monday, Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald said
the Apache helicopters would arrive in Albania on Tuesday, unless
weather interferes.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., returned to Washington after a weekend
trip to the Balkans and warned Monday that it would be ``many
weeks'' and ``perhaps months'' before the Apache helicopters would
be a major factor in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's looking for a silver bullet,'' said Levin, a
member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He briefed
reporters, he said, in an effort to lower public expectations for
the helicopters, which are expected to begin flying missions in
about a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilots have to become accustomed to the terrain,'' Levin
said, adding that the complex support and defense preparations,
which include putting spotters on the ground to guide pilots to
potential targets, are a long way from completion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Apaches must proceed on a gradual basis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 82nd Airborne Division was formed in 1917 at Camp Gordon,
Ga. Because members of the division came from all 48 states,
including Sgt. Alvin York of Tennessee, the unit was nicknamed
``All-Americans'' that led to its famed ``AA'' shoulder patch.
</P>
<P>
   The division led the assault at Normandy Beach in D-Day in World
War II. Following the surrender of Germany, it was ordered to
Berlin for occupation duty.
</P>
<P>
   The division was called to action during the Tet Offensive in
Vietnam in 1968, in Grenada in 1983, as part of ``Just Cause'' to
arrest Panama strongman Manuel Noriega in 1989 and the liberation
of Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   As the 82d Airborne troops were getting organized by the taxiway
here Monday, an American mobile artillery unit from Germany rolled
out the airfield gates in the general direction of the
Albania-Kosovo border.
</P>
<P>
   The artillery troops were armed with truck-borne multiple rocket
launchers designed to fire tactical ATACM missiles, nicknamed
``Attack-Ems,'' at targets 60 miles away or further. The missiles
arrived here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As the American artillery unit passed along the potholed, narrow
roads leading northward, Albanians watched by the side of the road
with delight and wonderment. ``This is very lucky for all
Albanians,'' said Simon Goni, 58, owner of a roadside cafe. ``The
Americans are our guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday was also a day of considerable jubilation at the
headquarters of the Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA, in the capital
Tirana, where members of the guerrilla organization were issuing
KLA press credentials to journalists for use in territory inside
Kosovo after it has been ``liberated'' from the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the U.S. Army will stay forever in Kosovo,'' said Visar
Reka, a KLA spokesmen. ``I wish America would make it the 51st
state.''

KOSOVA CASTS A SHADOW OVER ADRIATIC RESORTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The bombing and the refugee crisis in Yugoslavia are
affecting vacation travel in some areas on the Adriatic Sea, and
not others _ so far. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Resorts on the Dalmatian coast, on the eastern shore of the
Adriatic, report dwindling numbers of visitors, and tourists have
largely abandoned Apulia, across the Adriatic on the heel of
Italy's boot.
</P>
<P>
   But in Venice tour operators and hotel owners are holding their
breath. The war has not affected tourism there, and indeed, the
Easter season was one of Venice's brightest ever _ perhaps, tourism
officials say, even buoyed by the decision of major cruise ship
operators to reroute their vessels from Croatian ports like
Dubrovnik to ports in Italy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than any other region, the Dalmatian coast of Croatia is
hurting. ``Tourism is suffering, even though it is peaceful and
quiet here,'' said Mives Milos, spokeswoman for the tourism board
of Dubrovnik, the ancient seaport that is the area's principal
attraction. ``People think we are too close to the war, and the
name Dubrovnik is associated with Yugoslavia.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tourism had begun to revive from the shaking it took during the
brutal three-year Bosnian war. When that conflict ended in 1995,
tourists began trickling back to Dalmatia, the narrow finger of
Croatian territory that inches down the Adriatic's eastern shore _
albeit in numbers far below what they had been before the fighting
began.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 tourist arrivals in Croatia rose 9.5 percent, to 4.2
million. Martin Brackenbury, chairman of the World Tourism
Organization's business council, said that travel bookings to
Dalmatia were ``not looking as good as we would like.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Ms. Milos said, Dubrovnik counted 13,526 visitors to
its narrow lanes and medieval ramparts. In the first 12 days of
this April, only 1,307 visitors came, more than 80 percent of them
from Croatia and neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dubrovnik's airport, on the bluffs above the Adriatic, was
closed for several days at the outset of the NATO air strikes; it
has reopened, but only for flights to and from the Croatian capital
of Zagreb. Other connections, like Alitalia's scheduled
twice-weekly flight between Rome and Dubrovnik, have been suspended
indefinitely. Dubrovnik's hotels, which have 7,000 beds, remain
open, Ms. Milos said, yet only about 200 visitors a day are
arriving.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dubrovnik and other Croatian ports have also been hurt by the
caution of major cruise lines, including Windstar Cruises, Holland
America, Silversea, and the Carnival Corp.'s Seabourn Cruise Lines
and Cunard Line, which have replaced stops there with stops in
Italy and Greece. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dalmatia's plight is in marked contrast to the exuberance in
most Italian cities on the Adriatic, including Venice, though some
regions of Italy, like Apulia, are suffering a flight of visitors
similar to Dubrovnik's. Ferry operators in Italian Adriatic ports
like Ancona have seen travelers eastward dwindle, and elsewhere
Italian officials fear that if the fighting continues or escalates,
they too may be affected. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had any signs of cancellations,'' said Pierluigi
Bolla, commissioner for tourism in the Veneto region, of which
Venice is a principal attraction. In resorts like Jesolo, he said,
hotels just reopened for the season were not sufficient to absorb
the tourist invasion.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But farther down Italy's Adriatic coast, in Ancona, the
principal port for embarkation to Dalmatia, ferry operators report
a sharp drop in travelers that reminds them of the dark years of
the Bosnian conflict. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the tourism research group of Confcommercio,
the Italian retailers' association, said that statistics were not
yet available, but that anecdotal evidence indicated that Easter
was a problem in Apulia. In March, after the bombing began, Italy
declared a state of emergency in the region, both for its proximity
to the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, 120 miles across the
Adriatic, and the possibility of large numbers of refugees from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At Brindisi and Bari, Apulia's major cities, the commercial
airports remain closed, forcing travelers to use the Naples
airport, a 120-mile bus ride to the west. Three NATO bases from
which warplanes are launched toward Kosovo _ in Brindisi, Gioia del
Colle and Amendola _ are there, and anti-aircraft missile launchers
and mobile radar units have been deployed along the region's broad
white beaches, frightening tourists away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Florentine schoolchildren on a recent outing to Torre
Cintola, an Apulian resort, telephoned home with excited reports of
missile emplacements near their hotel, so many calls were made to
the school by concerned parents that the trip was curtailed. &QL;

SERB DRAFT CALL TO MONTENEGRIN MEN CAUSES FRICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia _ With his aviator sunglasses, bomber
lapel pin and Bruce Willis-style attitude and haircut, Velko
Vlahovic looks every part the fighter pilot. But like so many men
here facing conscription by the Yugoslav military to fight,
Vlahovic doesn't know what he would do if Slobodan Milosevic's
forces demanded that he fight in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As a Yugoslav Air Force reservist, Vlahovic has dedicated much
of his life to aviation _ flying for the air fleet, painting
picture-perfect images of military aircraft, and participating in
air shows with his many friends in the US Air Force and British
Royal Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   His photo albums are filled with pictures of smiling American
military pilots, their arms slung around Vlahovic's broad
shoulders. The 31-year-old half-Serb, half-Montenegrin pilot still
e-mails a US Air Force buddy in Aviano, Italy, where NATO planes
are stationed for the attack on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Vlahovic considers himself what he calls a
``Yugoslav Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to fly, but I don't want to kill anyone, especially my
friends,'' said Vlahovic. He has received a draft notice, but
convinced the Army that it was a mistake, since he is an Air Force
reservist and pilots have not yet been called up.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro, which, with Serbia, makes up Yugoslavia, is
determined to stay out of the war in Kosovo. Part of its civil
disobediance has been a defiance of the Yugoslav Army's aggressive
effort to conscript Montenegrin men between 18 and 65.
</P>
<P>
   Even the 42-year-old Justice Minister, Dragan Soc, has received
three draft notices _ all of which he has defied. ``I think it's
politically provoked,'' said Soc, whose Montenegrin government
opposes Milosevic and the Yugoslav President's policies in Kosovo.
``There is no army in the world which calls up a minister in the
government into service in the infantry with a gun _ except mine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Milosevic regime also renewed its demand that Montenegro's
deputy prime minister, Novak Kilibarda, be arrested and tried in a
military court for his anti-conscription statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``They chose me as an example,'' said Kilibarda in an interview.
``I feel proud they are prosecuting me. It's like they are giving
me a medal against Milosevic's policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilibarda is heavily guarded, spending his nights at a local
hotel. Two Montenegrin police officers stand at the entrance of the
floor, wielding assault weapons. Bodyguards shadow him as he
attends sessions of Parliament and teaches at a local university.
Soc doesn't bother with extra protection. His house is directly
across the street from the military court, which could try him if
he continues to defy the Army. Soc salutes them as he walks past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just part of the special psychological war between civil
authorities and Milosevic's military authorities,'' Soc said.
</P>
<P>
   Soc's open and confident defiance is typical of people here.
Vastly outnumbered in population (a half million in Montenegro
against 10 million in Serbia) and in military capability (a maximum
10,000 Montenegrin police versus 20,000 Yugoslav Army troops
already stationed in Kosovo), Montenegrins say they would take up
arms to fight for their own republic _ be it against Serbia or
against NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a pacifist,'' and so refused the Yugoslav Army's
conscription effort, said 24-year-old Alem Mlatisuma. But he said
he would fight if Montenegro were attacked. ``The line between a
war criminal and a pacifist is very thin,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Soc said he did not know how many men had dodged the draft; the
estimated 25,000 Montenegrins who did answer the call are either
loyal to Serbia or felt obligated to follow the Yugoslav order, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Montenegrin government does not recognize Milosevic's
declaration of war, and so says the aggressive conscription and
attempt to arrest Kilibarda are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Local Montenegrin authorities are trying to protect men from the
draft by declaring that their civilian work is critical to hold
together the already-dismal Montenegrin and Yugoslav economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly don't do anything as a government to forbid
people from being conscripted,'' said Radomir Sekulovic, a senior
advisor to the Montenegrin government. The local authorities simply
told business owners that they should draw up a list of the
indispensable employees _ and ``you can guess'' that the list
includes draft-age men, Sekulovic said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Milosevic regime hasn't made the final push _
arresting government ministers, or imposing martial law here. But
locals fear the day is coming. Montenegrin political leaders and
residents alike display a remarkable willingness to take on a
stronger enemy. Sekulovic insisted that the local police force _
combined with police reservists, could wipe out the Yugoslav
National Army.
</P>
<P>
   He ridicules the Yugoslav Army troops, which are now spread out
through Montenegro, reportedly having abandoned their barracks
because they are afraid they will be bombed by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is their level of courage, their bravery, go ahead _
they can hide under the skirts of women here,'' Sekulovic said.
``We see it as a sign of weakness'' of the Yugoslav Army, he said.
But Montenegrins, caught in the middle between NATO and the
Yugoslav federation _ a country they love, led by a regime they
despise _ aren't picking a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Many Montenegrins have fond remembrances of the days when
Yugoslavia, then made up of six republics, was in the globally
unusual position of being accepted by both the Western capitalist
world and the Eastern communist one.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rule of Josep ``Tito'' Broz, from the 1940s to the
1980s, Yugoslavs could go virtually anywhere with their passports.
Yugoslavia sided with the Americans in both world wars.
</P>
<P>
   Since the brutal Balkan wars of this decade and under the
leadership of Milosevic, Serbia has become a closed state. It's
difficult for foreigners to get in, difficult for locals to travel
out, and the republic is suffering from both air strikes and
international economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegrins, meanwhile, still look to the West, even as they
cry for a halt to the air strikes against both Montenegro and
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The office wall of the Information Secretariat here has a
portrait, not of Milosevic or even of Montenegrin President Milo
Djukanovic, but one of a smiling, young Tito. Vlahovic's photo
album shows the odd contradiction: There are photos of him standing
alongside a Yugoslav fighter plane, armed with American-made
Stinger missiles. In another, he is in a cockpit with the chief
flight tester for a major US aerospace company.
</P>
<P>
   A picture of his mother shows her, in typical 1960's style
bouffant hair and minidress, standing proudly by the family's
then-fashionably pink 1966 Ford.
</P>
<P>
   One of his recent e-mails from his US Air Force friend said the
American pilot had just returned from a bombing mission in Iraq,
and noted wryly that ``we almost came by to drop bombs on you at
Christmas and New Year's.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that Vlahovic could end up on the other side in an air
war against his e-mail pal is something he can't contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have got so many friends among US Air Force pilots,''
Vlahovic said, closing his photo album. ``I do not know what I
would do in that situation, if they called me up.''

COMPAQ WOES: POOR STRATEGY OR MANAGEMENT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The abrupt ouster of Compaq Computer Corp.'s chief executive
this weekend revealed a fundamental debate about the world's
largest PC maker: are its recent financial woes the result of a
flawed strategy, or simply poor management?
</P>
<P>
   In his eight years at the helm of Compaq, CEO Eckhard Pfeiffer
built the company from a troubled manufacturing operation into a
broad technology competitor. His purchase of Digital Equipment
Corp. last year for $9.1 billion symbolized Compaq's transformation
into a full-service firm able to sell everything from handheld
digital assistants to systems that power stock exchanges and banks.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from Digital's former services line has grown 10 percent
in the past year, analysts estimate, and Compaq also hopes to
profit from AltaVista, Digital's innovative Internet search-engine
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the effort to diversify hasn't eliminated Compaq's exposure
to competition in its chief line of business: building personal
computers for consumers and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Compaq said first-quarter profits would be half of
what was expected, sending its stock down 22 percent. Shares fell
3/4 to close at 22 7/8 in New York Stock Exchange trading Monday,
about half the level they traded at in January.
</P>
<P>
   Now critics worry the company has failed to integrate Digital
and other disparate pieces into a cohesive whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear what Compaq is or what it stands for in the
market,'' said Merrill Lynch analyst Steve Milunovich. ``They're
not blowing the cover off the ball,'' said BT Alex Brown analyst
Phil Rueppel.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts Monday, Compaq Chairman
Benjamin Rosen rejected those opinions and said the Digital deal
and others mean the company ``can offer more complete solutions''
to customers than specialized competitors like Dell Computer Corp.,
which sells computers directly over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem lies in putting the broader strategy into
practice, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've fully exploited the potential of Digital
but I think we're well on our way,'' said Rosen, who now shares
Pfeiffer's duties with other board members pending a search for a
permanent replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq says it has completed the bulk of the work needed to
integrate Digital with the rest of its operations, centered in
Texas. To profit from the boom in Internet stocks, Compaq plans to
sell shares in AltaVista to the public. Compaq also recently
purchased Shopping.com, an electronic commerce service, for $220
million to bolster AltaVista, which has lagged behind Yahoo Inc.
and Lycos Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq also has moved AltaVista to offices on the West Coast,
part of a broad reorganization of Digital assets.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak in the late 1980s Digital, based in Maynard, Mass.,
employed 30,000 workers in Massachusetts and New Hampshire,
including large operations where it assembled minicomputers and
PCs.
</P>
<P>
   But Digital was late to the personal-computer boom, and by the
time of its takeover was attractive mainly for its services unit,
which sets up and runs large corporate computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   With headquarters in Stow, Mass. and headed by former Digital
executive John Rando, Compaq Services now employs 27,000 workers
worldwide, including much of a staff of 7,000 in Massachusetts and
about 2,000 people at offices in Nashua, N.H. Another 2,000 people
assemble high-end server computers at a plant in Salem, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Compaq also has service staffs in Shrewsbury,
Lexington, and Littleton and keeps an engineering office in
Marlborough. Shrewsbury is also the location for a unit that
develops information-storage systems.
</P>
<P>
   After the Digital deal, revenue from Compaq's services division
climbed to $3.7 billion last year from $462 million in 1997. Gross
profit margins for services were 32 percent, compared with 23
percent for the company as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't been enough to offset falling margins in Compaq's
main business segment, computer products, which fell to 22 percent
last year from 28 percent in 1997 amid stiffer competition from
rivals like IBM and Dell. Still, the 12.8 million PCs Compaq
shipped last year still made it the world's largest producer.
</P>
<P>
   IBM shipped 7.6 million and Dell shipped 7.3 million machines,
out of a total world market of 92.9 million, according to Gartner
Group's Dataquest unit.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to Rosen Monday, some analysts asked if the company
might abandon Pfeiffer's focus on building market share and
concentrate on increasing profits. Rosen declined to discuss the
tradeoff. ``We're not ready to answer that question, but it's an
excellent question and we're looking into it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Pfeiffer's removal, Compaq on Sunday said its former
chief financial officer, Earl Mason, had also departed to become
chief executive of another company. Rosen said Compaq plans to
allow the person it eventually selects for the top job to choose
the new chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq is due for several more days of scrutiny. Its
first-quarter results are due out Wednesday and the company's
annual meeting is set for Thursday in Houston.

BUSH DEFENDS SECURITY MEASURES IN TEXAS CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush said he had nothing to do
with a new policy that resulted in the arrests of four protesters
Monday outside the Governor's Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters complained the new rule was designed to squash
negative publicity about the governor as he considers a bid for the
Republican presidential nomination, but Bush and Texas Department
of Public Safety officials insisted that ongoing construction at
the mansion prompted the new policy.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush said it was solely the safety agency's call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't set the rules here,'' Bush told a news conference.
``They make the determination as to what's fair and what's not
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Public Safety decided last month that
protesters will have to restrict their activities to an area across
the street from the front of the mansion. Previously, they could
protest on the same side of the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a crackdown at all. As I understand it, there are a
set of rules. People are given a chance to come and express
themselves. If they block passageway into our mansion, they're
given a warning,'' Bush said. ``If they continue to do it, the only
recourse is to move them off ... Some people don't mind busting the
rules, and there's a consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   The consequences were demonstrated Monday when four people
protesting a bill that would allow certain industries to cut
pollutants voluntarily were arrested because they refused to stay
in the designated area, according to the DPS.
</P>
<P>
   DPS spokesman Tom Vinger said the four were arrested on charges
of obstructing a passageway, a misdemeanor punishable by up to six
months in jail and a maximum $2,000 fine. About 25 people were
protesting when the arrests were made Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``DPS Capitol Police asked them three times to disband and go to
the designated area. Those who did not comply were placed under
arrest,'' Vinger said.
</P>
<P>
   He said DPS officials decided to designate the protest area
because they were concerned about public safety when large groups
assemble outside the Governor's Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a large group is on the sidewalk, other people are going
to have to walk into the street to walk around them,'' he noted.
``For everybody's safety, we decided to establish a protest area,
so that people can protest, but it won't hinder anyone's access.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with him running for president,'' Vigner
said, referring to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But protester James Scott, who works for the consumer group
Public Citizen, said he and the other picketers were only
exercising their right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely think the Capitol Police were way out of line,
because this was just a peaceful protest,'' Scott said. ``They
weren't blocking anything at all. If anything was blocking the
entrance to the Governor's Mansion, it was the seven or eight cops
standing there looking ominous.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, there have been protests at the same location
with no problems,'' Scott said. ``They may have a heightened sense
of security because he's running for president ... and I would
understand that except he wasn't even there when we were
protesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush formed an exploratory presidential committee in March, but
he has said repeatedly he doesn't plan to make an official decision
on whether to run for president until after the state legislative
session ends on May 31.
</P>
<P>
   However, New York Times columnist William Safire on Monday
quoted Bush as saying: ``I am a candidate and I am going to be the
nominee. I think I am going to be the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he misspoke in the interview with Safire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot remember what the exact words were, but I have not
formally declared my candidacy, as you know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't actually seen the words'' in the column, he said.
``It should have been, `I'm still exploring.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If I run, I believe I have a very good chance to be the
nominee,'' Bush replied when pressed on the Safire interview. ``I
believe I'll be the nominee should I decide to run, but I've got a
lot of work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if I run, I have a good chance to be nominated. If I'm
nominated, I've got a good chance to win, but I haven't formally
declared my candidacy,'' he said.

HIGH COURT UPHOLDS LAW BANNING OBSCENE E-MAIL SENT AS ANNOYANCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday upheld a federal law
prohibiting computer users from sending obscene e-mail messages
intended to annoy their recipients.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, the justices affirmed without comment a
lower court's decision that ApolloMedia Corp. violated the 1996
Communications Decency Act with its ``www.annoy.com'' Web site, on
which people can send anonymous e-mail messages to public
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The lower court, a panel of three federal district court judges
in California, said the San Francisco-based company violated a
provision of the law that prohibits the transmission of a
``communication which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy or
indecent with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass another
person.''
</P>
<P>
   The messages ApolloMedia transmits to public officials via its
Web site are often laced with profanities and, some might say,
obscenities. In ruling against the company, the three-judge panel
said the law was valid, citing Supreme Court decisions that
obscenity is not protected under the First Amendment right to free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, people who send obscene e-mail messages with the
intent to annoy can be sentenced to prison for up to two years.
</P>
<P>
   In its unsuccessful appeal to the high court, ApolloMedia argued
for a broad interpretation of the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At stake ... is the right of ... all Internet users not to
have to live under the uncertain cloud of a statute that on its
face makes an indecent communication a felony,'' the company
argued.
</P>
<P>
   ApolloMedia President Clinton Fein, in a message on his
company's Web page, said that the free-speech rights of all people
were at stake in the Supreme Court appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This endeavor is not expedient, it is not politic and, indeed,
it more often than not, is not particularly popular,'' he said of
his company's legal challenge. ``Real free speech seldom is, but
fighting this battle is the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department had urged the justices to reject the
appeal, saying the federal government would not prosecute violators
of the law, such as ApolloMedia, unless their e-mail messages were
obscene.
</P>
<P>
   The decency act allows challenges to its constitutionality to be
appealed directly from a federal district court to the Supreme
Court without having to be considered first by an intermediate
appeals panel.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' unsigned, one-line decision in ApolloMedia vs.
Reno followed a 1997 ruling in which they struck down as
unconstitutionally broad a different provision of the decency law.
That provision had made it illegal for anybody to send ``obscene or
indecent'' material on the Internet that they knew could be seen by
someone under 18.
</P>
<P>
   While obscenity enjoys no constitutional safeguards, material
that is merely indecent is constitutionally protected, the court
said in 1997.

TURKISH ELECTION RESULTS REFLECT THE KURDISH WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Results announced Monday from the national
election on Sunday underlined the gap that separates Kurds living
in the impoverished southeast from the rest of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   In most of the country, the two top parties were the Democratic
Left, led by Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, and the far-right
Nationalist Action party. Both oppose any compromise with the
Kurdish movement, which they see as a threat to national unity.
</P>
<P>
   But in the southeast, the pro-Kurdish People's Democracy party
crushed all others. Although it will not be represented in
parliament, because it failed to take 10 percent of the vote
nationwide, its candidates were elected to govern six of the
region's most important cities.
</P>
<P>
   People's Democracy supports talks to end the fighting that has
raged in the southeast for the last 14 years. That idea is anathema
to the two parties that won in the rest of the country. They insist
that there is no independent Kurdish identity and no Kurdish
problem, only a problem of terrorism fomented by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The victory of Ecevit's party, with about 22 percent of the vote
based on a count of three-quarters of the ballots, came as no
surprise. But it was not decisive enough to end the uncertainty
that has hung over Turkey for the last few years. Who will head the
next government, and which parties it will include, remains
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The strong showing of Nationalist Action, which took about 18
percent, astonished even its own leaders. In the last election it
did not even manage to pass the 10 percent threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalist Action is based on the ideology of pan-Turkism,
which holds that Turkic peoples from the Balkans to China are part
of a great nation. Its symbol is a gray wolf, a reference to an
ancient legend of a gray wolf that led Turkic tribes westward from
their ancestral homeland in Central Asia many centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no time when there were no Turks,'' the party's
general secretary, Koray Aydin, asserted in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Nationalist Action has included strong strains of
chauvinist nationalism. Paramilitary groups associated with the
party are said to have been responsible for killing thousands of
leftists, Kurdish nationalists and others during the late 1970s, a
period of upheaval that was ended by a military coup in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   After the death of the party's leader, Alparslan Turkes, in
1997, it began to fashion a new identity. Several figures
associated with violent gangs were excluded from its list of
candidates this year, and the new party leaders said they
represented a modern form of nationalism compatible with European
values.
</P>
<P>
   The surge of votes for Nationalist Action was one of several
surprises in the voting on Sunday. The Islamic-oriented Virtue
party, which some had viewed as the most potent force in Turkish
politics, slumped unexpectedly to third place with about 16
percent. It managed, however, to re-elect its mayors in the
country's two largest cities, Istanbul and Ankara.
</P>
<P>
   Both center-right parties, Motherland and True Path, also lost
strength. Motherland, led by former Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz,
finished fourth with about 13 percent, while True Path, led by
another former prime minister, Tansu Ciller, followed with about 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The corruption of Yilmaz and Ciller has destroyed their two
parties,'' the Istanbul newspaper Sabah said in a front-page
commentary. ``Both of them should resign. Their mistakes have
caused the radical right to grow, and this is not a healthy
situation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The country's oldest political grouping, the People's Republican
party, which traces its roots to the founding of the Turkish
Republic in 1923, polled less than 9 percent and will not be
represented in the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Many votes for Nationalist Action evidently came at Virtue's
expense. They were apparently cast by voters trying to show their
dissatisfaction with the political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   The election results also appeared to have been strongly
affected by the change in national mood that followed the capture
of the Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan in February. Ecevit
profited from the fact that he was in power at the time of the
capture. Nationalist Action fed the wave of aggressive jubilation
that followed it, orchestrating rock-throwing attacks on Ocalan's
lawyers and demanding his execution.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a polar opposite to Nationalist Action, it is
certainly the pro-Kurdish People's Democracy party. Many of its
members consider themselves Kurds first and Turks second. The
party's sympathy for Kurdish nationalism has led prosecutors to
file a case aimed at dissolving it.
</P>
<P>
   People's Democracy polled only 4 percent of the vote nationwide,
but it won the mayor's race in Diyarbakir, the largest city in the
southeast, and also those in the predominantly Kurdish cities of
Bingol, Batman, Siirt, Hakkari and Sirnak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people voted for the party that is on their side,'' said
Feridan Celik, who was elected mayor of Diyarbakir.

   WIS-WELFARE (Milwaukee) _ Michelle Crawford's odyssey _ from
desperation to distinction, from welfare to work _ is indeed a
powerful, inspiring story. It is also an incomplete one, at least
in its official telling. After years of severe anxiety and
depression, Ms. Crawford, 39, is indeed off welfare and on the job
at a plastics factory outside Milwaukee. Her diligent record
recently earned her a raise, to $8.20 an hour. But behind the
scenes, her accomplishments have also placed new burdens on a life
that is much more difficult than her admirers realize and less
steady than the governor may hope. By Jason DeParle.

have come so far. Back in 1899 a patient with asthma might well
have marched under doctors' orders directly to the tobacconist for
a cigarette: ``smoking is sometimes beneficial'' for this
condition, the manual reports. An alcoholic might have been dosed
up with opium, or sent off to suck an orange and drink a pint of
hot water before meals to curb his craving. For baldness, the
doctor might have suggested applying ammonia to the bare pate
(``very useful'') or taking a little arsenic by mouth. By Abigail

IT WAS HEARTBREAK FOR RODGERS IN SENIOR EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEARTBREAK HILL _ When he set out in Hopkinton with the intent
to establish one of three over-50 records within his reach, Bill
Rodgers never imagined his Boston Marathon would end this way: on a
cot in a Red Cross medical tent, his feet propped up, a thermometer
stuck in his mouth, and his aching body covered by a layer of
blankets and Mylar wrap.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old Rodgers had hoped to be the first American
veteran to break the tape on Boylston Street in Boston, but fell
far short of the mark. He dropped out of the race, becoming the
first runner to check into a medical tent at the crest of
Heartbreak Hill, suffering from dehydration and fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an experienced runner,'' said Heather Aiello, a Red Cross
spokeswoman. ``He knows when it's time to turn around.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting a head cold, Rodgers struggled mightily to reach the
top of Heartbreak Hill. He plodded past the crest, then abruptly
came to a stop. He did an about-face and walked into the tent.
</P>
<P>
   This was nearly the same spot where Rodgers had pulled out twice
before _ in his very first Boston Marathon in 1973 and again in
1977. In both instances, Rodgers recalled, heat played a factor.
Monday, warm weather proved to be his undoing again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was whipped,'' Rodgers said. ``I was getting lightheaded and
I began to see flashing lights and I knew it was the first signs of
dehydration. If I kept going, I would've collapsed. I would've
keeled over.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers did not want to risk that, even though it meant dropping
out of a race he had won four times and abandoning his quest to
break the over-50 course record (2:27:17), the over-50 record for
an American (2:31:34), and the American over-50 record on a
point-to-point course (2:25:46).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on par for the record, and even had hit all my splits,''
said Rodgers, holding out a hand on which he had scrawled
checkpoint times. ``But when I hit the 15-mile mark, that's when I
felt like I hit the wall. For some reason, I've run so many hard
marathons over the years, that . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers paused and blinked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a tough event,'' he said. ``I've run 58 marathons
and have had eight DNFs now, but the thing people don't realize is
that Boston is the trickiest marathon to run in because of the
course. Boston is one of the greatest challenges in the marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   When he reached the 15-mile mark, Rodgers began to feel the
effects of the weather. And he had not yet hit the hills of
Wellesley and Newton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt tired,'' said Rodgers, who reached the half-marathon
mark in 1:14. ``I ran a hard race a week before in the pouring rain
and got a little bit of a cold and it left me, maybe, a little
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can run the marathon, but I don't know if I can push hard
for records. Maybe it's my body telling me that I'm getting old and
I can't push that hard. I can still run the marathon, but I have to
run it carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Gail Rodgers, Bill's wife, thought he made the right call.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked very pale and I think he made a wise decision to
drop out,'' she said. ``Bill knows himself quite well. He would
never run himself into real trouble. He knows when to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's going to be real disappointed. He trained so hard
for this marathon. He trained as hard for this marathon, maybe
harder, than for any marathon he's run. He was very serious about
it. He was in very good shape. He probably just tried to do to
much. He's going to be very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if this would deter him from running next year, Rodgers
said not at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll run with my brother Charlie next year, and we'll
cruise it, you know?'' he said. ``I've run 58 hard marathons, and I
don't want the last one to be a DNF.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers was soon joined in the medical tent by 50-year-old Joe
Wargo of Falls Church, Va., who in his third Boston was also
overcome by dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   When Wargo spotted Rodgers conducting an interview, he held out
his cap and asked for an autograph. Rodgers obliged.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best race I've ever dropped out of,'' Wargo said.
``I'm going to tell everybody I dropped out at the same spot as
Bill Rodgers.''

NATO SEES LOSSES ON THE PROPAGANDA FRONT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ NATO confirmed Monday it had probably killed fleeing
Kosovo refugees by mistake and at the same time began discreetly
beefing up its public relations apparatus, apparently worried that
it is in danger of losing the propaganda war even as it insists it
is winning the military one.
</P>
<P>
   While Europe's most prominent spin doctor worked behind the
scenes to bolster NATO's small, inexperienced publicity arm, the
alliance brought forward a commander leading the air war to admit
that his pilots may have inadvertently killed refugees.
</P>
<P>
   US Air Force Brigadier General Daniel Leaf stood in the briefing
room at NATO headquarters in Brussels, admitting his pilots bombed
vehicles in a convoy last week in which dozens of ethnic Albanian
refugees were killed, while Alastair Campbell, British Prime
Minister Tony Blair's press secretary, settled into an office just
down the corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's office confirmed that Campbell had been asked by NATO
general secretary Javier Solana and NATO chief spokesman Jamie Shea
to advise them how to improve NATO's public relations strategy. A
Downing Street spokesman said Campbell would remain in Brussels
overseeing a revamping of NATO's public information office ``as
long as it would be helpful.'' Other NATO countries are also
expected to send in public information officers to help Shea, who
has a staff of just three despite representing the world's biggest
military alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell was invited in after last week's debacle in which NATO
admitted its forces had inadvertantly bombed a column of refugees,
released a tape recording of a pilot purportedly talking about why
he mistakenly bombed the refugees, then insisted the recording was
of a pilot who had actually bombed Yugoslav forces, not civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Among the press secretaries of the various European leaders,
Campbell is widely considered the most powerful, making policy as
often as he articulates it. He is credited with devising the
campaign strategy that Blair used to move the British Labor Party
away from its dogmatic left-wing policies, end 18 years of
Conservative rule, and win the biggest parliamentary majority in
nearly two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Blair is willing to dispatch indefinitely to NATO
the man widely regarded as his closest adviser underscores how much
importance the western allies attach to the propaganda war, in
which Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic gained a leg up last
week after the embarrassing slaughter of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's appearance by Leaf, meanwhile, created as many
questions as it answered. The general, who is in charge of the
pilots based at Aviano, the main NATO airbase in Italy, said his
pilots had bombed two separate convoys near Djakovica over a
two-hour period last Wednesday. Serb authorities claimed up to 80
refugees were killed by NATO bombs, but reporters brought to the
scene by Serb military minders a day later counted about two dozen
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf said a reconstruction of the bombings, based on interviews
with the pilots, video imaging of the attacks, and press accounts,
led him to conclude that the first bombing run destroyed a military
target, but that the second convoy included civilian vehicles and
``unforseen casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a review of the first bombing showed that the pilot had
hit a vehicle carrying Serb troops who had been torching homes, an
integral feature of the Serb effort to drive ethnic Albanians out
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf said the pilots who dropped bombs on the second convoy,
after watching enhanced pictures of what they saw through their
four-inch targeting screens, acknowledged that the vehicles they
bombed could have been tractors used by fleeing refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The general said NATO could not be sure how many of the refugees
were killed by bombs because its investigators could not visit the
scene. He suggested Serb troops had opened fire on the refugees,
and dropped grenades on them from helicopters, after the NATO
bombing. He said other refugees had told journalists that some of
the bombs were dropped by low-flying jets, while the NATO planes
were flying at high altitude. Reporters who saw the bodies,
meanwhile, said some appeared to have been machine-gunned.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf said British pilots flying in the same area had tried to
warn their American colleagues that the convoy they were targeting
included civilians, but the attack ended before the Americans got
the warning. He also acknowledged that the American pilots decided
that the second convoy was a military one even though it included
far more vehicles than Yugoslav forces are known to travel in.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as there was any doubt, they stopped attacking,'' Leaf
said, adding, ``We don't jump to hasty decisions in these life and
death'' situations.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf declined to detail what information, besides their
eyesight, the pilots used to decide that the second convoy was
military. Last week, NATO officials said they were flying at 15,000
feet, but Leaf said that specifying how high NATO fighters were
flying would help Serb forces shoot them down.
</P>
<P>
   That information deemed crucial to the security of NATO pilots
Monday had been freely disclosed last week underscored attempts by
NATO to put its information office in order.
</P>
<P>
   A British government spokesman said Campbell was shocked when he
found out how small the NATO press operation was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was designed for peacetime,'' said the spokesman. ``This is
a unique situation, and clear support was needed.''

YUGOSLAV PRESS SAYS U.S. INTENDED TO KILL REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KOSOVO-NATO) 
(mk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ While NATO was making its own efforts
Monday to explain what happened last Wednesday in southwestern
Kosovo where, Yugoslav authorities say, 74 ethnic Albanians died in
a NATO attack on a convoy, a most decidedly alternative version has
appeared in the state-run Yugoslav press.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav version says American officials deliberately sought
out a convoy of refugees to kill. It includes what is said to be a
tape recording of the pilot's conversations with his superiors in
which he calls the Yugoslav forces ``Reds'' and is ordered to fire
by his controller, despite his protests.
</P>
<P>
   (The tape has been doctored, NATO's civilian spokesman, Jamie
Shea, said at a briefing in Brussels, Belgium, with the start of
the recording remixed and the end completely fabricated.)
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav version also asserts that Defense Secretary William
Cohen ordered the NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, personally to
choose the pilot, who for some reason was Dutch, and that President
Clinton wanted to dismiss Clark when the pilot failed to kill the
refugees in sufficient secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   According to Monday's Vecernje Novosti newspaper, ``well
informed sources in the White House'' said the Americans had
decided to kill ethnic Albanian refugees and blame their deaths on
the Yugoslavs. Supposedly upset with the influence of the moderate
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, who is talking to Yugoslav leaders
and urging refugees to return home, the White House wanted to send
a message, the paper claims.
</P>
<P>
   There were two reasons to kill the Albanians, the paper
asserted: ``To let everyone know that there would be no return for
refugees, because it is against NATO strategy, and second, to
accuse Serbian security and police forces with accompanying media
propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   But after other pilots saw the ``Dutch pilot,'' who is said to
have been trained in the United States, attack the convoy, Clinton
was furious, the paper said. ``After this alleged massacre, Clinton
wanted Clark fired right away, the same source says,'' according to
the Vecernje Novosti report.
</P>
<P>
   The tape recording of what was said to be a conversation between
the pilot (``Charlie Bravo'') and his guidance officers in the
AWACS plane (``Mother'') was played with a very heavy Serbian
voice-over on state television on Sunday night, again giving credit
to Vecernje Novosti.
</P>
<P>
   It includes the following exchange, translated from the Serbian
voice-over:
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie Bravo to Mother. I am keeping 3,000 feet. Under me
columns of cars, some kind of tractors. What is it? Requesting
instructions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother to Charlie Bravo. Do you see tanks? Repeat, where are
the tanks?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie Bravo to Mother. I see tractors. Can the Reds have
camouflaged tanks as tractors?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother to Charlie Bravo. What kind of strange convoy is this?
What civilians? Damn, this is the Serbs' doing. Destroy the
target.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie Bravo to Mother. What should I destroy? Tractors?
Ordinary cars? Repeat, I can see no tanks. Request additional
instructions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother to Charlie Bravo. This is a military target, a
completely legitimate military target. Destroy the target. Repeat,
destroy the target.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie Bravo to Mother. Understand. Roger. Target locked.
Launching.''

ARROJO FINALLY GAINS FIRST VICTORY OVER BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Whenever he had faced the Red Sox in the past, Rolando
Arrojo might have been tempted to wonder: You call this freedom?
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old _ that's what he says he is, anyway, though some
archivists believe he may have forgotten to count four birthdays or
so _ defected from Communist Cuba on July 9, 1996. And after a
bidding war for his devilish sidearm services, the righthander
burst upon the US baseball scene last season, winning 14 games for
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, a record for an expansion pitcher, and
being acclaimed as the American League Rookie Pitcher of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Except against the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   In Tampa's maiden game at Fenway Park last June 12, he dropped a
5-1 decision, though he allowed only two runs and struck out nine
in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   In his first start of 1999, Tampa's home opener April 9, Boston
oppression continued as Arrojo lasted just 5 1/3 innings in a 4-1
loss.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday the refugee celebrated Patriots Day spectacularly,
shackling the Red Sox for seven innings in a 4-1 victory, his first
of the season. Rationing his pitches like Castro does essentials,
Arrojo threw the ball only 79 times _ 53 for strikes _ struck out
six, walked none, and allowed only three hits, including Jose
Offerman's tainted home run to right field in the fourth that
appeared to hit the railing but was ruled to have gone into the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when everything seemed to go right for him, experts in
the visitors' clubhouse were asked what had worked best for Arrojo.
</P>
<P>
   ``His breaking ball for strikes from down under,'' said manager
Larry Rothschild. ``And he was pinpointing his fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A great slider,'' said former Boston catcher John Flaherty,
who assisted his batterymate with a run-scoring double in the
second and a sixth-inning homer, his first ever at his former
address.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Arrojo figured he had a couple of more important
items working _ his back and his head.
</P>
<P>
   Both had been betraying him all season. A sore lower back
rendered spring training a wasted exercise for him, and the
distraction of the pain weighed heavily on his mind. That was
reflected in his first two outings: the loss to the Sox and a
no-decision against Toronto in which he couldn't hold a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lost his concentration or something in that game,'' said
Flaherty. ``Today I thought he had his concentration throughout.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Arrojo theorized, was because he had his health throughout
_ well, almost. Until a stiff neck prompted Rothschild to lift him
for precautionary reasons, Arrojo was a portrait of physical
fitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really good for the first time,'' he said through his
interpreter, bullpen coach Orlando Gomez. ``I felt I didn't have a
real good spring because I couldn't throw the ball hard. But after
my last start, I could finally do my normal training _ running,
working on my legs. This was the first time my back hadn't bothered
me.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, ``my head was never out of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That was most evident in his one suspenseful inning, the fourth,
when Jeff Frye followed Offerman's leadoff homer with a single,
putting the tying run on base. After retiring Reggie Jefferson on a
fly to center, Arrojo faced his most crucial duel of the day. And
he won it by getting Nomar Garciaparra on a pop to second.
</P>
<P>
   ``He set the whole thing up with breaking balls,'' marveled
Rothschild. ``Nomar, being one of the best hitters in baseball,
fought him off on a few. Then he threw a fastball that he really
let go.''
</P>
<P>
   That handcuffed Garciaparra, and after Arrojo ended the threat
by getting Troy O'Leary on a dribbler in front of the plate, he was
in command.
</P>
<P>
   Given his recent medical history, the stiff neck may have been
alarming. But Rothschild attributed it to nothing more than fatigue
_ ``This was the first time he'd gone seven innings'' _ and Arrojo
considered it a nuisance, not a concern.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could have finished had it not been for Rothschild's
caution, Arrojo spoke emphatically a word that required no
translation:
</P>
<P>
   ``Easy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just what his workday was against the Red Sox. Finally.

COUNTRYMEN GIVE ROBA THE BOOST SHE NEEDS TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- En route to her Boston Marathon victories the past two
years, Fatuma Roba's journey through the Newton hills was made
easier by the waving flags and joyous cheers of her fellow
Ethiopians, many of whom gloried in dashing into the street to run
with her for as long as their full hearts could manage.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no surprise to the 27-year-old Roba when a dozen or so
exuberant members of the local Ethiopian community met her Monday
on the second hill. She especially loved their sense of timing:
Running on course-record pace under a sapping sun, Roba was
starting to falter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very tired,'' she said afterward through a translator.
``To be honest, the flags gave me a boost.''
</P>
<P>
   If the flags gave her a boost, the headband sent her heavenward.
She donned the red, green, and yellow gift thrust at her by an
admirer, rewarding him with a glowing smile, then sped off to
victory in 2 hours 23 minutes 25 seconds, joining Uta Pippig as the
only women to win three straight Boston Marathons since women were
officially allowed to compete in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it very special to me to win a third time,'' said
Roba, whose victory earned her $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   Second ($40,000) was Franziska Rochat-Moser of Switzerland in
2:25:51, while Japan's Yuko Arimori, now living in Boulder, Colo.,
was third ($22,500) in 2:26:39. Lynn Jennings of Newmarket, N.H.,
went through the halfway point in 1:12 but faded to finish 12th in
2:38:37.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it would be difficult,'' said Jennings, her legs so
stiff she needed help getting up the few steps to the microphone.
``I was not really prepared to start hurting the way I was at 15 or
16 miles.''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Roba, too, was hurting, blisters on the toes
of her right foot slowing her in the last miles. ``I was expecting
a better time, 2:21 or 2:22, but unfortunately this was the time
that I had,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Coming through the halfway point, the women were led by Sun
Yingjie, a 20-year-old from Liaoning, China, running her fifth
marathon but her first outside her country. Seemingly overexcited,
the young runner took off like a shot, putting 49 seconds on the
pack by 3.1 miles and 55 seconds by 6.2 miles.
</P>
<P>
   But by 9.3 miles, Roba and Kenyan Catherine Ndereba, making her
marathon debut, were beginning to reel her in, closing the gap to
41 seconds, and by 13.1, the midpoint of the race, Roba and Ndereba
_ having finally realized there was someone in front of them _ were
only seven seconds back and working together to close fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I didn't know'' someone else was in the lead, Roba
said afterward. ``Later I noticed, and just decided I had to change
my pace. I wasn't scared of the Chinese runner.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither, it turns out, was anyone else. ``I think no one was
taking her seriously,'' said Rochat-Moser. ``I think all the girls
looked at (each) other but not at the Chinese girls.'' Sun's
teammate, 21-year-old Ai Dongmei, finished 19th in 2:47:11.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sun's eagerness took her through the half in 1:10:20,
on a pace to break the world record, she was passed just steps
later by both Roba and Ndereba, and would finish a painful 11th in
2:37:11, and was quickly put on intravenous to combat dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   Now the race was down to Roba and Ndereba, the 26-year-old
Kenyan who has twice been ranked the No. 1 runner of the year for
her success at shorter distances. For 3 miles, the rookie ran right
on the veteran's shoulder, matching her stride for stride and both
still on a pace to run the fastest women's marathon in history as
they made the turn by the firehouse on Commonwealth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   But now, entering the Newton hills, they were in Roba's land.
Less than a mile later, at 18, the Ethiopian had been so uplifted
by her supporters that she was 20 yards ahead. By 20 miles, on
Heartbreak Hill, it was 160 yards, and soon Ndereba was nowhere to
be seen. She would finish sixth in 2:28:27, yet another competitor
vanquished by the 1996 Olympic gold medalist and now three-time
Boston Marathon winner who appears destined to have her name etched
in history with the likes of Joan Benoit Samuelson, Ingrid
Kristiansen, Rosa Mota, and Grete Waitz.

 &HT;    Star reporter was tainted by story about Tailwind
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ CNN severed relations Monday with Peter Arnett, one of
the network's brightest stars during the Persian Gulf War and later
its most controversial for his role in the Operation Tailwind
fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1966 for his reporting for
The Associated Press in Vietnam and who is recognized by his
colleagues as one of the greatest war correspondents of the
television age, was tarnished when he reported the Operation
Tailwind story, charging that the United States used nerve gas in
Laos in 1970. CNN then retracted the story in the biggest
embarrassment in its history.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett, 64, did not return telephone calls seeking comment
Monday. He was quoted in USA Today, before his departure was
announced, as calling CNN's treatment of him ``pretty shabby.''
Later on Monday, Arnett was quoted in a CNN statement as saying,
``I've had a long and wonderful relationship with CNN and have been
proud to be part of this great news organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The terse news release stated that CNN and Arnett had ``reached
an understanding that will bring Arnett's 18-year service to an
amicable conclusion.'' He had been in the middle of a five-year
contract, with a window of negotiation coming in July.
</P>
<P>
   CNN International President Eason Jordan, to whom Arnett
reported, declined to comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While Tailwind may not have been the only cause of Arnett's
dismissal _ there were indications from within CNN Monday that
salary and other issues were involved _ it's unthinkable that the
network would have ended his contract now had it not been for
Tailwind.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett was reprimanded by the network for his role as reporter
of the Tailwind story, which aired last June as the first
installment of the TV newsmagazine ``NewsStand.'' The report,
stating that U.S. military personnel used nerve gas in Laos in
1970, was soon attacked by the military.
</P>
<P>
   Besides retracting the story and reprimanding Arnett, CNN fired
two producers and allowed one executive to resign. The network has
since settled, for hundreds of thousands of dollars, at least two
lawsuits by veterans involved in Tailwind alleging defamation of
character, and at least two more suits are pending.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much Arnett contributed to the Tailwind story became a
source of controversy. He said at the time that he was responsible
for ``not one comma,'' and producers April Oliver and Jack Smith
acknowledged that they were the prime movers of the story, which
they maintain is true.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a gutsy reporter who has an incredible track record,''
Oliver said Monday from her home in Virginia. ``The military made
it clear that they wanted his head and it appears now CNN has given
it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one military man was glad at the news about Arnett:
Maj. Gen. Perry Smith, the former CNN military analyst (now with
NBC) who resigned over Tailwind and pushed the network to
apologize.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have any credibility left,'' Smith said Monday,
from Augusta, where he lives. ``Why he was not fired last summer
amazes me. It's taken awhile, but at least it's finally
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People looked at me as a role model,'' Arnett said last year,
shortly after being reprimanded by CNN. ``They couldn't understand
how a role model could be involved in such a sorry episode as this.
My journalistic principles were bent, but they're intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnett's role in Tailwind eventually came to overshadow the rest
of his career as a war correspondent. After he said he had narrated
the piece as a good ``company man'' but had not researched it, CNN
correspondent Christiane Amanpour, wrote a blistering op-ed piece
for The New York Times, attacking Arnett.
</P>
<P>
   But the incident displayed a key part of the TV newsmagazine
culture: that producers and researchers generally do all the
legwork, and the ``name'' correspondent usually comes in at the
last minute to do some interviews and narrate. After Tailwind, the
broadcast networks all went on record as saying that never again
would a correspondent on a challenged report be able to say he or
she was just a narrator.
</P>
<P>
   And some of Arnett's colleagues, aware that he had been caught
in a bad situation not entirely of his own making, stuck up for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never met anybody who had more respect for Peter Arnett
and his lifetime achievement as a reporter,'' CBS News anchor Dan
Rather said at a meeting with TV critics earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett was hired by CNN in 1981 when the network was still
disparaged by most professional journalists. ``Not only was he a
solid reporter, but he was valuable in terms of showing we were
serious about what we were doing,'' said Ed Turner, a former key
vice president at CNN.
</P>
<P>
   There was no doubt that the 18-year CNN veteran was
conspicuously absent from his network's coverage of the war in
Yugoslavia, though he had covered Yugoslav conflicts several times
from 1994 to 1997. Arnett told The New York Times he had asked CNN
to send him to Yugoslavia, but some CNN executives reportedly
believed that he continued to be tainted by Tailwind.
</P>
<P>
   ``His work will stand in the hall of great reporters. I think
the body of his work will survive the unfortunate concllusion that
occurred here,'' said Turner, now president of the Forum Network, a
public affairs cable network.

 &HT;    Braves notes: Braves bats and Baylor make for explosive lineup
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Consider the Braves offense of late.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-record 20 runs they scored on Sunday is a little
inflated to read much into, but why not? Underneath the light-air
advantage of Coors Field appeared some major forces at work, some
forces that re-shape the kind of offense the Braves will be putting
on this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some new trends developing _ some that were set by new hitting
coach Don Baylor _ that may re-define this lineup:
</P>
<P>
   _ A newfound patience in Andruw Jones.
</P>
<P>
   He struggled in spring training and struggled in the first week,
hitting the same way he hit the first half of last season - in a
hurry. Swinging at breaking balls in the dirt, missing fastballs
over the plate, falling behind pitchers and having little chance to
catch up.
</P>
<P>
   But ever since he came back from three consecutive strikeouts to
take a walk, score a run and eventually drive in the winning run in
a 3-2 win over the Diamondbacks, Jones has been a new hitter.
</P>
<P>
   He has struck out only three times in the six games since, none
in the last four games. He drew three walks on Saturday against
Colorado, bringing his season total to eight, which leads the team.
His patience paid off a day later on Sunday - when he doubled his
hit production this season in one game with a career-high five hits
and watching his batting average climb from .156 to .265.
</P>
<P>
   And he talks like a new hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day you go out, you can learn something,'' Jones said.
``I'm looking for a good pitch to hit, if I don't get it, I ain't
going to swing. They're going to get tired of seeing you walking
and they'll give you a pitch to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Continued quiet success of cleanup hitter Brian Jordan if it's
possible to get a quiet 13 RBI in the first 11 games. He lacks the
pop of Andres Galarraga but who doesn't? He's scored runs in nine
of the first 11 Braves games, driven in runs in seven of the 11,
scored a pair of winning runs and leads the team with four home
runs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chipper Jones has already matched his home run total from the
right side from a year ago, in only 11 games this season. That was
the first item of business when he first met with Baylor this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Braves are scoring some runs without waiting on the long
ball. They are 3-1 this season when they haven't hit a home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not relying on the three-run homer,'' Chipper Jones
said. ``We've got some guys who can run a little bit. we're doing a
good job of hitting behind runners, moving guys over, hitting a
harmless groundball to get a run in. When you execute, good things
happen, and we executed well (Sunday).''

CLINTON SEEKS $6 BILLION TO PAY FOR WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Inside President Clinton's request Monday for $6
billion in emergency funds to pay for the war in Yugoslavia lies a
clue that NATO's air strategy is about to shift from a near-total
use of accurate ``smart bombs'' to a greater emphasis on more
destructive but inaccurate ``dumb bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the extra money being requested _ $5.1 billion _ will go
for fuel, munitions, and other war supplies. The rest will pay for
aid to Kosovar refugees and to the countries in the region that are
giving them shelter.
</P>
<P>
   In the month's worth of bombing to date, officials said, the
Defense Department has spent nearly $1 billion _ $698 million for
munitions (bombs and missiles), $287 million for operations (fuel
and spare parts).
</P>
<P>
   The emergency request of an additional $5.1 billion breaks down
to $1.5 billion for munitions and $3.6 billion in operations.
</P>
<P>
   The vast boost in spending for operations makes sense, given the
substantial increase in US aircraft, helicopters, and personnel
moving into the area.
</P>
<P>
   However, it might seem strange, at first glance, that, even with
all this extra weaponry, the munitions over the next five months
will cost only twice as much as the munitions fired in the
campaign's first 27 days.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre was asked about this at the
White House news briefing, and his explanation revealed an
impending change in the bombing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an operation like this,'' he said, ``you use more of your
precision munitions'' _ cruise missiles and laser-guided smart
bombs _ ``in the very early days of the operation. ... Later on in
the operation, of course, it's what we call `dumb bombs,' you know,
it's gravity ordnance or semi-aided devices, and that's largely
what we're using now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruise missiles cost more than $1 million apiece. Laser-guided
bombs cost around $100,000; the highly advanced AGM-130s, fired
from F15E aircraft, cost $800,000. Gravity bombs _ the
old-fashioned kind that just fall through the air, then explode _
are much, much cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, NATO and Pentagon briefers have said over 90 percent
of the weapons dropped have been precision-guided munitions. This
explains why their cost over just the past month has amounted to
nearly $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   If the total cost of munitions over the next five months comes
to only $1.5 billion, as Clinton's supplemental request states,
then the mix of weaponry is likely to include very few smart bombs.
</P>
<P>
   John Pike, a military specialist at the Federation of American
Scientists, said Monday evening: ``If one takes these numbers as a
blueprint for the war, then this thing starts to look more like
Vietnam than Desert Storm. Five months of dropping dumb bombs on
Kosovo _ that will turn the place into a moonscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, videos shown at NATO's daily briefings reveal a growing
use of cluster bombs, which subdivide into as many as 200 bomblets.
Cluster bombs are generally used to attack wide areas, where troops
or weapons may be spread out, as opposed to pinpoint targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can surmise that we're going to start dropping a
lot more cluster bombs,'' Pike speculated.
</P>
<P>
   There might be several reasons for this shift. First, there are
only a limited number of targets for which precision-guided
munitions are most useful _ bridges, railroad lines, and factories
in well-populated areas, where commanders want to hit the target
without damaging the surrounding houses.
</P>
<P>
   Commanders might want to hit some of these targets again _ for
example, bridges, after they have been repaired _ but there is no
need to re-hit all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Second, NATO briefers have said future air campaigns will focus
more on hitting Serbian forces in the field. Many of these troops
are hidden or spread out. Some analysts have noted it makes little
sense to drop a $100,000 bomb in order to hit a single Serbian
tank, especially since the bomb might miss. It is cheaper, and may
be more effective, to spread out a cluster of bombs, in hopes of
hitting a lot of targets _ tanks, trucks, whatever _ in the general
area.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Hamre's statement of a new strategy _ which, if true,
should be seen materializing in the next week or so _ Clinton's
request for more money may raise other questions when Congress
starts considering it next week.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said
Monday that the $5.1 billion, requested for the military, may
exceed what is actually needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We erred on the side of more, not less,'' Lew said, in order
``to provide flexibility for circumstances that may develop in a
variety of ways.''
</P>
<P>
   However, some circumstances could arise that would make the sum
end up being less than what is needed.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the $5.1 billion assumes no ground troops are
introduced into the area, either in a combat or peacekeeping role.
If such troops are needed, Lew said, ``that would be a separate
action...and that would in fact require further funding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated last week that 4,000
peacekeeping troops _ which is what the aborted Rambouillet
agreement called for _ would cost an extra $50 million a month.
</P>
<P>
   Deploying and maintaining a division of combat troops would cost
$200 million a month _ $300 million if they were thrown into
battle.
</P>
<P>
   All of these matters are likely to be the subject of debate in
Congress, where some legislators want heavier, and some want
lighter, US involvement in the war.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton Monday called his request ``a matter of life
and death'' for the mission. Hamre said, ``We really do need it by
the first part of May'' to avoid facing ``a genuine readiness
crisis.''

NATO ACKNOWLEDGES IT MAY HAVE KILLED CIVILIANS IN BOMBING RAIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO acknowledged for the first time on
Monday that it bombed two entirely separate groups of vehicles near
the Kosovo town of Djakovica last Wednesday and might have killed
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, NATO has only acknowledged that its planes
accidentally bombed a civilian tractor north of Djakovica on that
day. But Serbian authorities and Kosovar refugees have insistently
reported allied hits along the road south of Djakovica, putting
NATO credibility to a severe test. The Serbs claimed that 60
civilians were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Providing its first comprehensive briefing on the disputed
attacks, NATO officers said that their pilots, flying at high
altitude, had been convinced that they were striking only military
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But as the raids proceeded, allied officers at a command post in
Italy became concerned that fleeing refugees might be in the second
group, a huge convoy of more than 100 vehicles southeast of the
town.
</P>
<P>
   Their suspicions were aroused after NATO intelligence experts
warned that Serbian military forces do not generally travel in such
long columns.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of OA-10 observation planes were quickly dispatched to
the area. Using binoculars, their pilots reported that civilian
vehicles appeared to be interspersed with the military ones, and
the NATO attacks were broken off.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we know from the debris that the Serbs showed is that
some civilians died there and that there is the possibility that
NATO aircraft were the cause,'' said Brig. Gen. Daniel Leaf, the
American commander of an air wing at Aviano, Italy, who led the
official NATO inquiry into the episode.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's briefing demonstrated the difficulties of identifying
targets from high altitude over a region where Serb army and police
forces have been driving civilians from their homes and often
herding them down roads. Allied planes have spotted Serb tanks
concealed next to ruined homes and even churches, and Serbian
soldiers have been reported using tractors and other vehicles as
well as military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's assessment was also an important political test for the
alliance. Since NATO's April 14 air strikes against convoys near
Djakovica spurred allegations of civilian casualties, NATO
spokesmen have been on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   That was the result not only of the insistent Yugoslav charges,
which were buttressed by reporters taken to the scene by Belgrade
authorities. It was also the result of contradictory statements by
NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, and conflicting
accounts of the raid by the Pentagon and the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   NATO sought to explain its error on Monday by releasing a flood
of information about aircraft patrols, laser-guided bombs and even
conversations between the pilots and airborne controllers.
</P>
<P>
   One such excerpt was drawn from a conversation between an
airborne command post, referred to in military parlance as ABCCC,
and an F-16 pilot attacking the convoy south of Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just received word that this is a VJ convoy,'' the ABCCC
told the F-16 patrols, using the acronym for the Yugoslav military.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of bad weather and frustrating attempts to uncover
hidden Serbian armor, the pilots thought they had stumbled on a
bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great,'' responded one of the F-16 pilots. ``ABCCC, I want as
many fighters as I can get, now.''
</P>
<P>
   Important questions still remain, however, some of which may
never be answered. One is how many civilians were killed in the
convoy on that Wednesday, and were they all killed by allied
planes. Another is whether NATO can reduce the risk of hitting
civilians without hampering its attacks on Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Another question is whether it is really possible to dependably
distinguish civilian from military targets at the altitude at which
NATO planes customarily operate, 15,000 feet, though they sometimes
fly somewhat lower.

MEDICARE WOULD PAY $1,700 A YEAR FOR PRESCRIPTIONS

<P>
   Congressional Democrats are expected to unveil legislation
Tuesday calling for Medicare to cover prescription drugs for 39
million elderly and disabled citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the bill calls for Medicare
to pay $1,700 a year towards outpatient prescription drugs for each
Medicare beneficiary, according to sources familiar with the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the program, which Republicans have warned would be
prohibitive, would be funded partly by the premiums paid by
seniors, a new tobacco tax, and money allocated from the federal
budget surplus. No exact figures on the cost of the proposal were
available.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy bill is the broadest proposal in Washington so far
to address what is increasingly perceived as Medicare's biggest
omission, the failure to cover outpatient medications.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill being cosponsored by Democratic Representative
Fortney ``Pete'' Stark of California, beneficiaries would chip in
20 percent of the cost of their prescriptions after meeting a $200
deductible. The benefit would be offered under Medicare's Part B
program, which pays for doctor's bills, home health care, and other
outpatient services. Seniors pay a monthly premium to cover 25
percent of Part B expenses.
</P>
<P>
   For seniors whose incomes are at or below 130 percent of
poverty, the bill calls for subsidies to help meet the deductible
and copayments.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the bill would cover 100 percent of the cost of
prescription drugs once a senior citizen spends $3,000 a year
out-of-pocket on medications. This benefit would be available to
all beneficiaries regardless of their income.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the bill would require all private insurance policies
that cover the bills not paid by Medicare _ so-called ``Medigap''
supplemental insurance policies purchased by seniors _ to offer
limited prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to be delivered Tuesday, Kennedy wrote, ``This
legislation is a lifeline for every senior citizen who needs
prescription drugs to treat an illness or maintain their health.''
</P>
<P>
   Seniors on average fill 18 prescriptions a year and take four to
six drugs a day, according to the Kennedy script.
</P>
<P>
   The growing importance of prescription drugs in the arsenal of
modern medicine and the rapidly escalating cost of those drugs have
boosted the argument for drug coverage under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscally conservative Republicans, however, have opposed adding
an expensive new benefit when the Medicare program is estimated to
run out of money as early as 2015.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fiscally fragile program,'' said Gail Wilensky, who
ran the Medicare program under the Republican Bush administration
and is chairwoman of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission,
which advises Congress on Medicare matters.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's proposal is also likely to run into stiff opposition
from the pharmaceutical industry, which fears that a broad benefit
under a government program would lead to price controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we understand it, the Kennedy proposal would. . . rely on
federal government controls for access, choice, scope of benefits,
and quality of care for seniors,'' said Alan Holmer, president of
the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an
industry group in Washington.

CLINTON SEEKS $6 BILLION TO PAY FOR WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Inside President Clinton's request Monday for $6
billion in emergency funds to pay for the war in Yugoslavia lies a
clue that NATO's air strategy is about to shift from a near-total
use of accurate ``smart bombs'' to a greater emphasis on more
destructive but inaccurate ``dumb bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the extra money being requested _ $5.1 billion _ will go
for fuel, munitions, and other war supplies. The rest will pay for
aid to Kosovar refugees and to the countries in the region that are
giving them shelter.
</P>
<P>
   In the month's worth of bombing to date, officials said, the
Defense Department has spent nearly $1 billion _ $698 million for
munitions (bombs and missiles), $287 million for operations (fuel
and spare parts).
</P>
<P>
   The emergency request of an additional $5.1 billion breaks down
to $1.5 billion for munitions and $3.6 billion in operations.
</P>
<P>
   The vast boost in spending for operations makes sense, given the
substantial increase in US aircraft, helicopters, and personnel
moving into the area.
</P>
<P>
   However, it might seem strange, at first glance, that, even with
all this extra weaponry, the munitions over the next five months
will cost only twice as much as the munitions fired in the
campaign's first 27 days.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre was asked about this at the
White House news briefing, and his explanation revealed an
impending change in the bombing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an operation like this,'' he said, ``you use more of your
precision munitions'' _ cruise missiles and laser-guided smart
bombs _ ``in the very early days of the operation. ... Later on in
the operation, of course, it's what we call `dumb bombs,' you know,
it's gravity ordnance or semi-aided devices, and that's largely
what we're using now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruise missiles cost more than $1 million apiece. Laser-guided
bombs cost around $100,000; the highly advanced AGM-130s, fired
from F15E aircraft, cost $800,000. Gravity bombs _ the
old-fashioned kind that just fall through the air, then explode _
are much, much cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, NATO and Pentagon briefers have said over 90 percent
of the weapons dropped have been precision-guided munitions. This
explains why their cost over just the past month has amounted to
nearly $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   If the total cost of munitions over the next five months comes
to only $1.5 billion, as Clinton's supplemental request states,
then the mix of weaponry is likely to include very few smart bombs.
</P>
<P>
   John Pike, a military specialist at the Federation of American
Scientists, said Monday evening: ``If one takes these numbers as a
blueprint for the war, then this thing starts to look more like
Vietnam than Desert Storm. Five months of dropping dumb bombs on
Kosovo _ that will turn the place into a moonscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, videos shown at NATO's daily briefings reveal a growing
use of cluster bombs, which subdivide into as many as 200 bomblets.
Cluster bombs are generally used to attack wide areas, where troops
or weapons may be spread out, as opposed to pinpoint targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can surmise that we're going to start dropping a
lot more cluster bombs,'' Pike speculated.
</P>
<P>
   There might be several reasons for this shift. First, there are
only a limited number of targets for which precision-guided
munitions are most useful _ bridges, railroad lines, and factories
in well-populated areas, where commanders want to hit the target
without damaging the surrounding houses.
</P>
<P>
   Commanders might want to hit some of these targets again _ for
example, bridges, after they have been repaired _ but there is no
need to re-hit all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Second, NATO briefers have said future air campaigns will focus
more on hitting Serbian forces in the field. Many of these troops
are hidden or spread out. Some analysts have noted it makes little
sense to drop a $100,000 bomb in order to hit a single Serbian
tank, especially since the bomb might miss. It is cheaper, and may
be more effective, to spread out a cluster of bombs, in hopes of
hitting a lot of targets _ tanks, trucks, whatever _ in the general
area.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Hamre's statement of a new strategy _ which, if true,
should be seen materializing in the next week or so _ Clinton's
request for more money may raise other questions when Congress
starts considering it next week.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said
Monday that the $5.1 billion, requested for the military, may
exceed what is actually needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We erred on the side of more, not less,'' Lew said, in order
``to provide flexibility for circumstances that may develop in a
variety of ways.''
</P>
<P>
   However, some circumstances could arise that would make the sum
end up being less than what is needed.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the $5.1 billion assumes no ground troops are
introduced into the area, either in a combat or peacekeeping role.
If such troops are needed, Lew said, ``that would be a separate
action...and that would in fact require further funding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated last week that 4,000
peacekeeping troops _ which is what the aborted Rambouillet
agreement called for _ would cost an extra $50 million a month.
</P>
<P>
   Deploying and maintaining a division of combat troops would cost
$200 million a month _ $300 million if they were thrown into
battle.
</P>
<P>
   All of these matters are likely to be the subject of debate in
Congress, where some legislators want heavier, and some want
lighter, US involvement in the war.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton Monday called his request ``a matter of life
and death'' for the mission. Hamre said, ``We really do need it by
the first part of May'' to avoid facing ``a genuine readiness
crisis.''

 &HT;    Pilot performed dogfight maneuvers before fatal crash
 &HT;    By Chris Reinolds
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTERSVILLE, Ga. _ Two people killed in a small plane crash
Monday in Bartow County, Ga. were apparently engaged in dogfighting
maneuvers with another plane.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Powell, National Transportation Safety Board air safety
investigator, said another aircraft was flying with the T-34 model
A plane that crashed at 12:51 p.m. The single-engine plane smashed
into a clump of pine trees in a field about 10 miles northeast of
Cartersville.
</P>
<P>
   The sky-blue plane's wing was found a mile from the crash site
south of Ga. 140. Powell said the two planes were ``performing a
mission.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They do dogfight simulations, from what I'm told,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The planes departed from Atlanta's Fulton County/Charlie Brown
Airport. The other plane returned to the airport following the
crash, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Bartow County Sheriff Don Thurman said witnesses saw the plane
spiral down into the stand of trees.
</P>
<P>
   Both planes apparently belong to Sky Warriors, which sells
flight combat fantasy experiences for $695.
</P>
<P>
   Sky Warriors' combat-trained pilots fly the T-34 military-style
trainers from the airport to the skies over Lake Allatoona. Once
there, the pilot, who sits in the back of the two-seat cockpit,
turns the controls over to the customer, the company's president
Earl ``Stinger'' Arrowood said in a 1996 interview.
</P>
<P>
   The plane came down about 100 yards from Shirley Trautwein's
barn in a neighborhood of homes on large lots widely scattered
around a valley surrounded by rolling hills.
</P>
<P>
   Trautwein wasn't at home when the crashed occurred, but arrived
later to find television news satellite trucks camped near her
house.
</P>
<P>
   After surveying the wreckage, Trautwein said the plane's
crumbled shell was no more than eight feet long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear them flying on the weekends and hear them
dogfighting,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Renate Kline, who lives across the valley near the crash, said
she and her husband heard a very loud boom but didn't see the
plane. Olive Waldorf, another neighbor, said she heard the
dogfighting, but didn't know the plane had crashed until she saw
the firetrucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a movie about World War I,'' Waldorf said.
``We're so used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second fatal plane crash in Bartow this year. In
February, an airplane slammed into the ground in Cartersville,
killing the pilot. That plane, a Piper Lance PA-32 RT, broke apart
about 20 yards from a 45-home subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators and witnesses said the Piper barely missed
crashing into the subdivision and into Cartersville Middle School,
about 150 yards from where deputies strung yellow police tape.

CLINTON ASKS CONGRESS FOR $6 BILLION TO PAY FOR KOSOVO
INTERVENTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton sent Congress a $6.05 billion
request Monday for emergency Pentagon spending to help prosecute
the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia and provide humanitarian
assistance to the Kosovar refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of promising quick approval, Republican leaders
threatened to turn the request into a platform for a debate over
U.S. military readiness, which they said has declined precipitously
under the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., issued a statement
labeling the request for funding ``shortsighted,'' saying that all
it would do is ``replace bullets for bullets and bombs for bombs
spent in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said he favors an ``open debate'' on the request that
would allow members to vent their frustrations about a U.S.
military he contends is spread so thin around the world that the
nation's defense is in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration has been downsizing the military
for the last seven years, and the Kosovo crisis has exposed how our
national security is now in real danger,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed with Hastert that a debate on military readiness
is a good idea. But he asked the Republicans to hold off on airing
their grievances about it until Congress takes up the Defense
Department appropriations bill later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need for this funding is urgent, immediate, clearly in the
national interest,'' Clinton said at a White House ceremony
honoring the national teacher of the year. ``There are literally
lives hanging in the balance. And so I hope, in the spirit of
genuine bipartisanship, the Congress will move the package right
away.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's request, based on the recommendation of Pentagon
officials, includes about $5.1 billion for military spending, $360
million for Defense Department humanitarian efforts, and $591
million in direct assistance to the Kosovar refugees and the
frontline states of Albania and Macedonia, where more than half a
million of them are living in camps.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the military-related funds, $3.6 billion would be used to
fund the U.S. portion of the ongoing NATO air campaign for the rest
of the fiscal year if necessary, while another $700 million would
be used to replenish munitions used in the attacks so far. The
remaining $800 million would be held in reserve and used as the
need arises.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget, told
reporters in a briefing that the emergency supplemental request
would ensure that the country maintains its military readiness
while providing ``the resources necessary to continue the current
operations as long as necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the humanitarian assistance will be enough to take care
of current refugee needs as well as ``additional refugee problems
as they emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the administration request was about $3 billion more
than Pentagon officials had hinted at last week, it was not enough
to Republican lawmakers who would like to use the supplemental
funding request to beef up other Defense Department operations and
provide a 4.8 percent pay raise for military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't just a matter of replacing spent bullets and bombs.
We must urgently improve our military capabilities across the
board. That means looking at weapons procurement, readiness,
personnel and other areas,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
R-Irving.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Clinton has created ``this national security
emergency by squeezing the defense budget while expanding military
commitments, first in Iraq and Bosnia, and now in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate side, Republicans are looking to use the emergency
funding request as a vehicle for debate over Clinton's entire
policy toward the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison cautioned against a protracted
debate over military matters Monday that would end up delaying
approval of the funding request. But she said it was important for
the Senate to at least give members a chance to share their views
on U.S. policy in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be bipartisan support for the funding request, but
there will also be debate on the policy,'' Hutchison said. ``People
are concerned about the way this operation is being conducted and a
lot of us are looking for more diplomacy and outreach to have a
chance for a long-term peace, not just in Kosovo but for all the
Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   While expressing support for the funding request, Hutchison said
Congress must ensure that the money does not come from ``other
defense appropriations.''
</P>
<P>
   As an emergency spending bill, however, the request is likely to
be paid for out of current budget surpluses and not by raiding
other programs or accounts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The threat by Republicans to turn the request into a platform
for criticizing Clinton administration policies came as no surprise
to White House officials who bristled last week when House Majority
Whip Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land, referred to the allied operation as
``the Clinton war.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican leaders have taken to calling the Kosovo
conflict ``the Democratic war,'' and Hastert has even referred to
U.S. military personnel involved in the NATO operation as ``his
(Clinton's) forces.''
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart told reporters Monday
that he hopes the Republican-controlled Congress will try to resist
the temptation ``to get bogged down'' in a bitter debate over
defense matters.
</P>
<P>
   He disputed claims by Hastert and others that the nation's
military readiness has eroded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our military readiness is top-notch. The president has worked
with the Pentagon over the last few years. We've reprogrammed some
money. There has been some ... additional readiness money
appropriated,'' Lockhart said, adding that Clinton included a
recommendation for a $100 billion increase in defense spending over
the next five years in his 2000 budget proposal.

US SUSPECTS HALF-MILLION ALBANIANS MAY BE MISSING

   WASHINGTON _ As many as 500,000 ethnic Albanian men are missing
and may be victims of Serb genocide, the State Department reported
Monday, igniting new fears about the breadth of Slobodan
Milosevic's brutal siege in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Amid allied reports of mass executions by Serb forces in more
than 60 Kosovo villages, State Department officials said no fewer
than 100,000 ethnic Albanian men are unaccounted for and may be
lying in mass graves throughout the separatist province. ``Based on
past practice, it is chilling to think where those 100,000 men
are,'' said State Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   The number of missing men could be as high as 500,000, the State
Department said, ``if reports of widespread separation of men among
internally displaced persons within Kosovo are true.''
</P>
<P>
   With the chaos in Kosovo, and the lack of international
observers in the province, State Department officials said, the
actual dimensions of the refugee crisis may not be known until
peacekeeping forces enter the territory.
</P>
<P>
   The report was issued as concern grew over the fate of an
estimated 35,000 ethnic Albanians who were trapped in Kosovo Monday
when Yugoslavia suddenly closed the main border crossing to
northern Albania. A top Albanian official said there is no trace of
the 35,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them disappeared,'' said Prec Zogoj, a top adviser to
Albanian President Rexhap Meidan. ``Where are they?''
</P>
<P>
   There were these other developments on the 27th day of the
allied airstrikes against Yugoslavia:
</P>
<P>
   _ President Clinton asked Congress for $6 billion in emergency
spending to fund the US military role in Kosovo through September
and increase aid to refugees. More than 600,000 ethnic Albanians
have fled Kosovo since the NATO airstrikes began.
</P>
<P>
   _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin directly appealed to Clinton
to end the NATO bombing and discussed the possibility of Russian
troops joining an international peacekeeping force in Kosovo when
the military conflict ends.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, in his first conversation with Clinton since the
bombing began, also vowed that the Russia military will not
intervene in the crisis and will not supplement the one spy ship
that is currently operating in the region.
</P>
<P>
   _ United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan announced he will
travel to Moscow next week to discuss Kosovo, including Yelstin's
offer for Russia to help mediate a possible truce.
</P>
<P>
   _ NATO formally acknowledged that two bombing raids in Kosovo
last week, including an attack on a refugee convoy, probably killed
dozens of ethnic Albanian refugees. ``It is possible there were
civilian casualties at both locations,'' said US Air Force
Brigadier General Daniel Leaf said.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Pentagon did not rule out the possibility that the United
States would try to exchange a captive Yugoslav army officer for
three American soldiers being held by Milosevic. ``We will pursue
any reasonable means to get them out,'' said Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth H. Bacon, when asked about a possible exchange.
</P>
<P>
   _ NATO officials, responding to concerns about the allies
launching a second month of air strikes Wednesday despite marginal
progress to date, appealed for patience. ``Since when was a
dictator defeated in 24 hours?'' said NATO spokesman Jamie Shea.
``It took six years to defeat fascism in Europe in the middle of
the 20th century. I think we can take two or three months to defeat
President Milosevic, quite frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Many of the allied nations, led by the United States, sought
consensus among the 19 NATO partners to prevent Yugoslavia from
importing oil. The strategy could include a naval blockade of
Yugoslav ports.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two American relief workers died when the car in which they
were riding veered off a slippery road and plunged about 1,300 feet
off a cliff in Albania as they headed for a refugee camp in Kukes.
They were identified as David McCall, 71, and his wife, Penny
McCall, 57, of New York City. The couple had played a pivotal role
in building Refugees International, a disaster relief group. Also
killed in the accident were Refugees International's European
representative, Yvette Pierpaoli, of Serviers, France, and the
car's Albanian driver.
</P>
<P>
   The developments occurred against a backdrop of fear and misery
on the roads leaving Kosovo and in the refugee camps in neighboring
countries. After 4,500 refugees trudged through the main crossing
point to northern Albania on Sunday, only 28 made it across Monday
before Yugoslavia shut down the border without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian officials said the additional 35,000 refugees were seen
headed for the border checkpoint at about 3 a.m. Monday. ``But
nobody arrived,'' Zogoj said.
</P>
<P>
   The 28 ethnic Albanians who did arrive told authorities they saw
rows of tractors and other vehicles abandoned by the roadside.
``They fear the vehicles may belong to the people who
disappeared,'' a relief official said in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering said the
United States has obtained ``numerous refugee reports of Serb
police now assembling Kosovar Albanians into grave-digging chain
gangs.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the refugees reportedly are being clad ``in red jackets
and forced to dig graves for their countrymen killed by Serbian
ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations World Food Program estimated Monday that
840,000 displaced Kosavars are on the move in the province, with
many facing grave risks. About a third of the homeless are bunched
near the borders with Montenegro and Macedonia. An additional
565,000 are believed to be divided into three separate groups
hiding in forests and on hills as they are shelled by Serb
artillery.
</P>
<P>
   As the UN agency issued an urgent appeal for food to feed the
840,000 homeless Kosovars, NATO vowed to press forward with the air
campaign and plans to commemorate the organization's 50th
anniversary with a three-day summit in Washington, beginning
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of determination is total,'' said NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana. ``This is not a conflict over territory or
raw materials or strategic routes. Only values are at stake here.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to meet in Washington before the summit with
Prime Minister Tony Blair of England, the major partner with the
United States in providing military support for the NATO campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In air strikes Monday night, NATO fired four missiles in two
separate attacks on a Serb satellite ground station that supports
telephone and television communications, according to the Yusolav
news agency Tanjug.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the relentless pounding for nearly a month, Milosevic
continues to send additional forces into Kosovo, where more than
43,000 Serb troops are believed to be carrying out his campaign of
``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of 24 US Apache helicopters are scheduled to arrive in
Albania this week for possible attacks on the Serb forces. The
Apaches, whose crews will face among the greatest risks yet among
the allied forces in the Balkans, are one of the Army's most
effective antitank weapons.

 &HT;    BellSouth adds Qwest to its puzzle
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (a) General news and (f) Financial categories.)
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth Corp. has agreed to pay $3.5 billion for 10
percent of Denver-based Qwest Communications, taking a large _ and
long-awaited _ stride toward becoming a complete telecommunications
company.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth, which has made no acquisitions since purchase of a
paging unit in 1992, has watched from the sidelines while the
industry has been rocked by a series of mega-mergers. Increasingly,
BellSouth has been under pressure from analysts and investors to
respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``This brings BellSouth back into the game,'' said Phil
Asmundson, director of telecommunications for Deloitte &AMP; Touche.
``That 10 percent at the end of the day is also a really
inexpensive way to practically guarantee exclusivity. As good as it
is to have Qwest, it's even better to make sure nobody else gets
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance might have been an all-out merger, but for the
limits of the law. Until BellSouth wins federal approval to offer
long-distance service, it is permitted only 10 percent ownership of
a long-distance company. Qwest, which last year bought LCI
International, is now the nation's fourth-largest long-distance
company. Qwest also has 18,500 miles of high-speed cables
crisscrossing the country.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth dearly wants entry into long-distance. But even more,
the Qwest alliance signals a vision of survival in a rapidly
shifting industry, and it is a different view than some others have
taken, said F. Duane Ackerman, company chairman and chief
executive. ``From my perspective, this is all about data. It is
about electronic commerce, Web hosting, Internet access and
video-streaming.''
</P>
<P>
   If the future belongs to data, profits from old-style voice
transmission are bound to fall, said Ford Cavallari, executive vice
president of Renaissance Worldwide, a Boston-based management
consulting company. Having access to Qwest's vast network should
let BellSouth exploit the transition to that new world, he said.
``This is very important and very impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the deal is most vulnerable is, ironically, the same place
it is strong: so many lines for high-speed data are being installed
that demand may take some time to catch up, slashing the immediate
profit from owning the networks, Cavallari said. There simply
aren't enough customers to use all the capacity _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   But prospects are generally good, said Marc Bacurin, analyst at
J.C. Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest should finish this year with revenue of $3.6 billion,
representing 60 percent growth, he said. ``This gives them access
to all of BellSouth's customers. It is a pretty good match.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gantt, economist and president of the Ansley Group, said
the deal is evidence of a shift inside BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are looking into the future and they know that the future
will be different from an old-line phone company. People will want
a company that will deliver a panoply of services to wherever they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth officials for months resisted the tide of mega-mergers
by saying the company was open to any negotiation, while expressing
confidence in its ability to succeed without a merger.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, Wall Street analysts have obviously become
more impatient with BellSouth's apparent determination to avoid a
merger.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth stock began to drift slowly downward from all-time
highs. In recent months, company executives have been increasingly
emphatic that there was no ``go it alone strategy,'' and rumors
began to swirl that a deal was in the works.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, talk of a Sprint deal dogged BellSouth for months.
But Sprint's cost would be formidable, and its management is
notoriously independent-minded. Moreover, Sprint already has
everything from local to long-distance and can play hard to get.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the most valuable part of an alliance is not the
network, said Michele Wolf, Bear Stearns analyst. ``The network is
the easy part. It is the distribution channels, the customer
support and the back-office that really makes a long-distance
company. You buy Qwest and you get a robust, solid long-distance
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch analyst Daniel Reingold too called it a positive
move. ``This deal gives BLS access to one of the premier fiber
optic networks in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   The pact benefits both sides. BellSouth gets access to 18,500
miles of high-speed lines, the expertise to manage those data
transmissions and the far-flung customers who use them. The two
companies can now market services jointly.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth now has a route to a full-tilt, national long-distance
effort _ and the only thing in the way is federal permission to
enter that market, which BellSouth expects soon. The deal gives
Qwest a local service presence that it has lacked, as well as much
deeper pockets and connection to a brand name that is good as gold
_ at least in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also meshes internationally. Qwest has a growing
business in Europe and is in talks toward a Japanese partnership.
BellSouth is the largest outside investor in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geographically, this is very complementary,'' Gantt said.
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of sheer size, BellSouth _ even with Qwest _ still
falls far short of rivals like AT&AMP;T and MCI WorldCom. And in terms
of services too, BellSouth still lacks some firepower.
</P>
<P>
   Most obviously missing from the BellSouth arsenal is
long-distance. But as the market for telecommunications becomes
national and even global, BellSouth is still mostly a regional
player drawing the lion's share of its business from phone service
in the Southeast. The combination has no local service component
outside the BellSouth region, no national wireless phone service
and only token international presence outside Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio shrugged off comparisons to larger rivals. ``I think we
match up quite well in high-speed Internet and broadband. I think
we are at the scale and scope to compete globally.''
</P>
<P>
   But BellSouth and Qwest may find themselves at a disadvantage to
companies that can offer one-stop shopping. That's why BellSouth
needs to win the right to offer long-distance, and it could be an
argument for adding other pieces as well, Cavallari said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, a telecom company should be able to offer voice,
video and data anywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, BellSouth had decided it needed to dramatically bolster
its high-speed and long-distance capabilities. That is why the
company approached Qwest, Ackerman said. ``It came out of our data
strategy, to pursue a good partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks started six months ago with Keith Cowan, vice president of
corporate development, serving as BellSouth's lead negotiator,
reporting to Senior VP Sidney Boren.
</P>
<P>
   As negotiations grew serious, Ackerman took to the air, flying
to Denver to meet with Nacchio. By this past weekend, with Nacchio
in Atlanta to close the deal, only details remained. Sunday, the
BellSouth board met via conference call and gave a thumbs up. A few
hours later, the Qwest board did the same. Another teleconference,
this one in the evening, was convened to inform various officers
and vice presidents of BellSouth and at 6 a.m. Monday, the word
went out to the news wires.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes later, Ackerman and Nacchio shared the spotlight
on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   One way to measure success of the Qwest deal would be
BellSouth's successful entry into long-distance. Ackerman has
predicted that BellSouth can collect about 25 percent of the
approximately $10 billion a year in long-distance business within
its region. Qwest offers a route to those revenues, but not without
approval to enter the market.
</P>
<P>
   Approval is no slam dunk. Three years after the
Telecommunications Act set out the rules for entering
long-distance, BellSouth has been rejected by regulators three
times _ twice for Louisiana and once for South Carolina. Rivals
like AT&AMP;T and WorldCom still bitterly oppose BellSouth's
application, arguing that the company has not opened its local
market up to competition as required.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ackerman predicted that BellSouth will be in long-distance
within the year, possibly within a few months. ``We are quite
optimistic about the outlook for Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the deal announced Monday provides that once BellSouth
has won approval for long-distance it can buy an additional 10
percent of Qwest and be given one of the seats on the 11-member
Qwest board. For two more years, the deal would limit BellSouth to
a 20 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman said he is not frustrated by the restrictions of law
and contract that will keep BellSouth from buying Qwest outright _
at least for now. ``We've always had the view that you can create
an alliance where you do not have to own everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators were quick to note that even with a only a 10
percent stake BellSouth was still paying far more for Qwest shares
than it would have a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman defended the price. ``The price reflects the great
potential we put on this aggressive young company. It gives us
access to a national network without having to build it
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Michael Balhoff of Legg Mason Wood Walker agreed that to
justify the deal, BellSouth must show its arrangement with Qwest
saves them from building $3.5 billion worth of network and
high-speed lines. ``And it appears that this is a reasonable
expectation.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Qwest seems vastly different from BellSouth,
which is often still seen as the stodgy successor to AT&AMP;T, enjoying
the monopoly bequeathed by Ma Bell.
</P>
<P>
   But through the 1990s, BellSouth has drifted through a long,
slow and sometimes painful transition that has reshaped its
identity. Tens of thousands of jobs have been cut, mostly from the
local phone unit. Other units _ wireless, Internet, cable
television _ have grown, often in businesses where cut-throat
competition is a given.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman said the two companies have worked together on a small
group of critical customers. ``We are not total strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio is, like much of BellSouth's top management, a veteran
of AT&AMP;T. Nacchio stayed with the giant after a federal consent
decree set off its 1984 divestiture of seven regional companies
known as the Baby Bells.
</P>
<P>
   At AT&AMP;T, Nacchio said he had not known Ackerman, but had been
friends with William Redderson, who is now vice president at
BellSouth. After divestiture, he fell out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``Machine Gun Joe'' by others inside AT&AMP;T, Nacchio was
known for his greater New York diction and his rapid-fire
conversational style. He was also known for turning around stagnant
units. By the mid-1990s, Nacchio was running the long-distance
consumer unit, a 40-something executive with a shot at succeeding
whoever was picked to run the company at the expected retirement of
Robert Allen.
</P>
<P>
   But another youngish executive _ John Walters _ was recruited
from the outside and named Allen's heir. Walters eventually was
sent packing, but not before the departure of many potential rivals
for the throne _ including Nacchio, who landed at Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth stock Monday rose 68.75 cents to $41.875. Qwest stock
soared $10.125 a share in early trading, before falling back to
close unchanged at $82.

industry has been rocked by a series of mega-mergers. Increasingly,
BellSouth has been under pressure from analysts and investors to
respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``This brings BellSouth back into the game,'' said Phil
Asmundson, director of telecommunications for Deloitte &AMP; Touche.
``That 10 percent at the end of the day is also a really
inexpensive way to practically guarantee exclusivity. As good as it
is to have Qwest, it's even better to make sure nobody else gets
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance might have been an all-out merger, but for the
limits of the law. Until BellSouth wins federal approval to offer
long-distance service, it is permitted only 10 percent ownership of
a long-distance company. Qwest, which last year bought LCI
International, is now the nation's fourth-largest long-distance
company. Qwest also has 18,500 miles of high-speed cables
crisscrossing the country.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth dearly wants entry into long-distance. But even more,
the Qwest alliance signals a vision of survival in a rapidly
shifting industry, and it is a different view than some others have
taken, said F. Duane Ackerman, company chairman and chief
executive. ``From my perspective, this is all about data. It is
about electronic commerce, Web hosting, Internet access and
video-streaming.''
</P>
<P>
   If the future belongs to data, profits from old-style voice
transmission are bound to fall, said Ford Cavallari, executive vice
president of Renaissance Worldwide, a Boston-based management
consulting company. Having access to Qwest's vast network should
let BellSouth exploit the transition to that new world, he said.
``This is very important and very impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the deal is most vulnerable is, ironically, the same place
it is strong: so many lines for high-speed data are being installed
that demand may take some time to catch up, slashing the immediate
profit from owning the networks, Cavallari said. There simply
aren't enough customers to use all the capacity _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   But prospects are generally good, said Marc Bacurin, analyst at
J.C. Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest should finish this year with revenue of $3.6 billion,
representing 60 percent growth, he said. ``This gives them access
to all of BellSouth's customers. It is a pretty good match.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gantt, economist and president of the Ansley Group, said
the deal is evidence of a shift inside BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are looking into the future and they know that the future
will be different from an old-line phone company. People will want
a company that will deliver a panoply of services to wherever they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth officials for months resisted the tide of mega-mergers
by saying the company was open to any negotiation, while expressing
confidence in its ability to succeed without a merger.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, Wall Street analysts have obviously become
more impatient with BellSouth's apparent determination to avoid a
merger.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth stock began to drift slowly downward from all-time
highs. In recent months, company executives have been increasingly
emphatic that there was no ``go it alone strategy,'' and rumors
began to swirl that a deal was in the works.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, talk of a Sprint deal dogged BellSouth for months.
But Sprint's cost would be formidable, and its management is
notoriously independent-minded. Moreover, Sprint already has
everything from local to long-distance and can play hard to get.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the most valuable part of an alliance is not the
network, said Michele Wolf, Bear Stearns analyst. ``The network is
the easy part. It is the distribution channels, the customer
support and the back-office that really makes a long-distance
company. You buy Qwest and you get a robust, solid long-distance
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch analyst Daniel Reingold too called it a positive
move. ``This deal gives BLS access to one of the premier fiber
optic networks in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   The pact benefits both sides. BellSouth gets access to 18,500
miles of high-speed lines, the expertise to manage those data
transmissions and the far-flung customers who use them. The two
companies can now market services jointly.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth now has a route to a full-tilt, national long-distance
effort _ and the only thing in the way is federal permission to
enter that market, which BellSouth expects soon. The deal gives
Qwest a local service presence that it has lacked, as well as much
deeper pockets and connection to a brand name that is good as gold
_ at least in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also meshes internationally. Qwest has a growing
business in Europe and is in talks toward a Japanese partnership.
BellSouth is the largest outside investor in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geographically, this is very complementary,'' Gantt said.
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of sheer size, BellSouth _ even with Qwest _ still
falls far short of rivals like AT&AMP;T and MCI WorldCom. And in terms
of services too, BellSouth still lacks some firepower.
</P>
<P>
   Most obviously missing from the BellSouth arsenal is
long-distance. But as the market for telecommunications becomes
national and even global, BellSouth is still mostly a regional
player drawing the lion's share of its business from phone service
in the Southeast. The combination has no local service component
outside the BellSouth region, no national wireless phone service
and only token international presence outside Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio shrugged off comparisons to larger rivals. ``I think we
match up quite well in high-speed Internet and broadband. I think
we are at the scale and scope to compete globally.''
</P>
<P>
   But BellSouth and Qwest may find themselves at a disadvantage to
companies that can offer one-stop shopping. That's why BellSouth
needs to win the right to offer long-distance, and it could be an
argument for adding other pieces as well, Cavallari said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, a telecom company should be able to offer voice,
video and data anywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, BellSouth had decided it needed to dramatically bolster
its high-speed and long-distance capabilities. That is why the
company approached Qwest, Ackerman said. ``It came out of our data
strategy, to pursue a good partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks started six months ago with Keith Cowan, vice president of
corporate development, serving as BellSouth's lead negotiator,
reporting to Senior VP Sidney Boren.
</P>
<P>
   As negotiations grew serious, Ackerman took to the air, flying
to Denver to meet with Nacchio. By this past weekend, with Nacchio
in Atlanta to close the deal, only details remained. Sunday, the
BellSouth board met via conference call and gave a thumbs up. A few
hours later, the Qwest board did the same. Another teleconference,
this one in the evening, was convened to inform various officers
and vice presidents of BellSouth and at 6 a.m. Monday, the word
went out to the news wires.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes later, Ackerman and Nacchio shared the spotlight
on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   One way to measure success of the Qwest deal would be
BellSouth's successful entry into long-distance. Ackerman has
predicted that BellSouth can collect about 25 percent of the
approximately $10 billion a year in long-distance business within
its region. Qwest offers a route to those revenues, but not without
approval to enter the market.
</P>
<P>
   Approval is no slam dunk. Three years after the
Telecommunications Act set out the rules for entering
long-distance, BellSouth has been rejected by regulators three
times _ twice for Louisiana and once for South Carolina. Rivals
like AT&AMP;T and WorldCom still bitterly oppose BellSouth's
application, arguing that the company has not opened its local
market up to competition as required.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ackerman predicted that BellSouth will be in long-distance
within the year, possibly within a few months. ``We are quite
optimistic about the outlook for Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the deal announced Monday provides that once BellSouth
has won approval for long-distance it can buy an additional 10
percent of Qwest and be given one of the seats on the 11-member
Qwest board. For two more years, the deal would limit BellSouth to
a 20 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman said he is not frustrated by the restrictions of law
and contract that will keep BellSouth from buying Qwest outright _
at least for now. ``We've always had the view that you can create
an alliance where you do not have to own everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators were quick to note that even with a only a 10
percent stake BellSouth was still paying far more for Qwest shares
than it would have a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman defended the price. ``The price reflects the great
potential we put on this aggressive young company. It gives us
access to a national network without having to build it
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Michael Balhoff of Legg Mason Wood Walker agreed that to
justify the deal, BellSouth must show its arrangement with Qwest
saves them from building $3.5 billion worth of network and
high-speed lines. ``And it appears that this is a reasonable
expectation.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Qwest seems vastly different from BellSouth,
which is often still seen as the stodgy successor to AT&AMP;T, enjoying
the monopoly bequeathed by Ma Bell.
</P>
<P>
   But through the 1990s, BellSouth has drifted through a long,
slow and sometimes painful transition that has reshaped its
identity. Tens of thousands of jobs have been cut, mostly from the
local phone unit. Other units _ wireless, Internet, cable
television _ have grown, often in businesses where cut-throat
competition is a given.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman said the two companies have worked together on a small
group of critical customers. ``We are not total strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio is, like much of BellSouth's top management, a veteran
of AT&AMP;T. Nacchio stayed with the giant after a federal consent
decree set off its 1984 divestiture of seven regional companies
known as the Baby Bells.
</P>
<P>
   At AT&AMP;T, Nacchio said he had not known Ackerman, but had been
friends with William Redderson, who is now vice president at
BellSouth. After divestiture, he fell out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``Machine Gun Joe'' by others inside AT&AMP;T, Nacchio was
known for his greater New York diction and his rapid-fire
conversational style. He was also known for turning around stagnant
units. By the mid-1990s, Nacchio was running the long-distance
consumer unit, a 40-something executive with a shot at succeeding
whoever was picked to run the company at the expected retirement of
Robert Allen.
</P>
<P>
   But another youngish executive _ John Walters _ was recruited
from the outside and named Allen's heir. Walters eventually was
sent packing, but not before the departure of many potential rivals
for the throne _ including Nacchio, who landed at Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth stock Monday rose 68.75 cents to $41.875. Qwest stock
soared $10.125 a share in early trading, before falling back to
close unchanged at $82.

STUDY SHOWS AIRLINES DOING WORSE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Neb., Kan.)  (af)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The major airlines are getting worse at many of the
parts of their jobs that passengers care about the most: being on
time, handling baggage and treating travelers decently.
</P>
<P>
   The findings come from the National Airline Quality Rating, a
study of statistics reported to the government conducted by
business professors at the University of Nebraska and Wichita State
University. The study also found that complaints to the
Transportation Department were up 26 percent in 1998, after rising
20 percent in 1997. The most frequent complaint was ``flight
problems,'' including cancellations and delays.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which made assumptions about the relative importance
of several factors, ranked USAirways as the best airline and United
Airlines, whose parent company the UAL Corp., as the worst. But the
authors acknowledged that few people have a choice between those
two, and that many have no choice at all.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said Dean E. Headley, an associate professor of
marketing at Wichita State who is one of the two authors, of the
1,000 most popular routes in this country, only about half are
served by more than one airline.
</P>
<P>
   Headley said, though, that ``if you still have some choice, this
may be useful to help you make a further choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey found enormous differences among the airlines for
each category.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked by the number of complaints, Northwest Airlines, which
left thousands of passengers stranded at the Detroit airport during
a snowstorm a year ago, had the worst record, 2.21 letters per
100,000 passengers. America West, whose parent is America West
Holdings Corp., was not far behind, with 2.11. Best was Southwest,
with 0.25 letters per 100,000 passengers, a rate one-tenth that of
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of planes arriving on time in 1998 was 77.2, down
from 77.9 the year before; Southwest Airlines was best, at 80.8,
and America West was worst, at 68.5.
</P>
<P>
   There were 5.16 mishandled bags per 1,000 passengers in 1998, up
from 4.96 the previous year. United was worst with 7.79 bags;
America West was best with 3.88.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints to the Transportation Department rose to 1.08 per
100,000 passengers, from .86 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   At the Air Transport Association, the trade group of the major
airlines, Edward A. Merlis, the senior vice president for
legislative and international affairs, said that some of the
problems were a byproduct of prosperity. Sitting in a full
airplane, he said, ``shorter tempers arise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more congested the system is, the lower your threshhold
for being disturbed,'' Merlis said. But a positive effect of fuller
flights is lower fares, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Merlis said the airlines had good reason to want to decrease the
number of misdirected bags, because it costs an airline an average
of $25 to return each lost bag to a passenger, a figure that is
about double the average profit per passenger.
</P>
<P>
   As for the number of complaints, he said that at about 8,000 a
year directed at United States airlines, ``out of 600 million
passengers, yes, a 25 percent increase is a lot and maybe it's
indicative of something, but I don't think as an absolute value
it's indicative.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates had other theories.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing is the net result of lack of competition,''
said Laurie Berger, editor of Consumer Reports Travel Letter.
``When there's no competition, there's no incentive for airlines to
provide better service.''
</P>
<P>
   Planes are dirtier and food is worse on domestic flights, Ms.
Berger added, because airlines are concentrating on their overseas
routes instead.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berger said that episodes like Northwest's mishandling of a
snowstorm in Detroit last winter, with thousands of people stuck in
planes for hours, had become ``the poster-child example of
passenger rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hudson, the executive director of the Aviation Consumer
Action Project, which is affiliated with Ralph Nader, the consumer
advocate, said ``the intensity of the complaints we get, I've never
seen it higher.''
</P>
<P>
   But in one category in the survey, the airlines did better.
Involuntary denied boardings, or ``bumping'' of passengers who had
reserved seats, fell to .87 per 10,000 passengers, from 1.06 the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Merlis said the reason was that ``yield management programs''
were improving. These are the same programs the airlines use to
decide how to price their seats, including when to raise the price
because only a few are left, and when to cut the price because
otherwise the plane will fly with empty seats.

LEMAY TOPS AMONG US FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Joe LeMay of Danbury, Conn., knew he wasn't the
odds-on favorite to be the first American to cross the finish line
of Monday's Boston Marathon. Which was fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept my eye on Rod DeHaven, the guy who everybody thought
would win,'' said LeMay. DeHaven indeed was the front-runner among
US athletes for much of the race, running with the lead pack for
most of the way, just a bobbing head to his fellow Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kept Rod in my sight; he probably had 20, 30 seconds on
me the whole time,'' said LeMay.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just before Heartbreak Hill, LeMay figured it was time to
make his move. He surged ahead and joined the leaders, and although
he was not fast enough to stay with eventual winner Joseph Chebet,
he was fast enough to leave DeHaven behind.
</P>
<P>
   LeMay earned no prize money as top American male, but his
13th-place overall finish was good for $1,800. And his time of 2
hours 16 minutes 11 seconds was good enough to earn him a spot in
the US Olympic marathon qualifier next February.
</P>
<P>
   DeHaven finished in 18th place, at 2:19:23, while last year's
top American, Joe McVeigh, finished 19th, at 2:20:21.
</P>
<P>
   LeMay, 32, had run four previous marathons, but Monday was his
first visit to the Boston course and Heartbreak Hill. He said it
was everything that he had anticipated. And more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little harder than I expected,'' he said. ``I thought
the downhills would be nice and easy, but they really tore my quads
apart. It was really difficult the last couple of miles.''
</P>
<P>
   He made adjustments for the temperature, which rose from 51
degrees when the starting gun went off at noon to 73 degrees an
hour later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had promised myself that if it was close to 70 degrees, I'd
adjust my goal,'' said LeMay. ``It was about 2:12 going in, but I
adjusted it to 2:14, 2:15. And I was prepared for that, had a lot
of water, and was constantly throwing water on me.''
</P>
<P>
   LeMay is eager for another shot at an Olympic qualifying race
after a bitter experience in 1996. He ran in the 10,000-meter
qualifier that year and finished second. But the race was slow, and
LeMay's time was not good enough to earn him a spot in the Atlanta
Games. So he was shut out of the Olympics. ``It sucked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LeMay, who started running competitively when he was 14, has
excelled at both 10,000 meters and the marathon. His fastest
marathon was in Chicago in 1996, when he finished in 2:14:58, and
he still holds the record at Princeton University for 10,000
meters, at 28:59.
</P>
<P>
   The last American to win the Boston Marathon outright was Greg
Meyer, in 1983, and LeMay acknowledged that at times he feels like
he's in a different league from the Kenyans, who dominate the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I feel like I'm not really in contention, although I did
beat a few Kenyans today,'' he said. ``They run the first half
faster than me, regardless, and I just try to pick up the pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   He put his time in perspective. ``I guess it's getting to be a
little prestigious to be the first American _ I mean, 2:16 is not
bad, but it's really not a very good time, taking into account the
rest of the world,'' he said. ``But I'm still very happy with it.''

COMMENTARY: THE GLOBALUTION GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few years ago I was interviewing a dissident Indonesian news
editor who was telling me about how he managed to get critical
things about the corrupt Suharto family into the heavily controlled
Indonesian press. He said that when President Suharto's son was
being given government subsidies for a wacky idea he had for
building an Indonesian car industry, the local press was reluctant
to come out openly against this nepotism. What the Indonesian press
did instead was wait for the World Trade Organization to bring a
case against Suharto's son for unfair trade practices and then
splash that on the front pages. The message was, ``Gosh, we would
never say anything bad about the president's son, but these folks
at the WTO sure think he's up to no good.''
</P>
<P>
   This Indonesian use of the WTO is not an isolated case.
Actually, it is an example of a new political phenomenon you can
see in many developing countries today, which I call
``globalution.'' Globalution happens when reformers understand that
revolution from below may be too explosive, and revolution from
above is never going to happen, so they choose revolution from
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Their strategy is to plug their country into every possible
global rules-based organization they can find _ from the World
Trade Organization to the PriceWaterhouseCoopers accounting firm to
Conservation International _ in hopes of importing rule-of-law
systems from beyond.
</P>
<P>
   This is how one should look at the issue of whether the United
States should support China's entry into the WTO _ something that
President Clinton balked at when China's prime minister, Zhu
Rongji, visited last week, but that Clinton is reconsidering and
renegotiating with the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   That China's joining the WTO _ on American terms _ is so
manifestly in our economic interest is not even worth debating.
America's markets are largely open. China's joining the WTO will
not have much impact on China's exports to the United States. But
it will have a huge impact on American access to China's market,
because it will force China to open up to foreigners on a defined
schedule with set rules overseen by a multinational organization _
replacing the arbitrary, closed system the Chinese have now. There
is this notion out there that letting China into the WTO is somehow
a giveaway. Well, it is, sort of. It's a giveaway to the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more going on here. Zhu Rongji is a closet
globalutionary. He knows that this deal would help force more
transparency, global standards and outside reviews on what is now a
highly secretive system of trade laws in China, in which individual
bureaucrats have huge discretion and therefore huge opportunities
to rip off both foreigners and Chinese. China's entry into the WTO
would also help open the interior of China to foreign investors in
the fields of Internet service, telephones, faxes and banking,
which in turn would help to raise living standards and to develop
parts of China that China itself cannot afford to develop. Right
now foreign companies cannot own telecommunications companies in
China. If China enters the WTO, Sprint, AOL and AT&AMP;T will all be
able to buy into companies there, and that can only contribute to
China's being more wired into the world. Lastly, Chinese
entrepreneurs, who today have to do their importing through state
trading companies, will now be able to import and export directly,
which can only help strengthen the private sector in China.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Zhu clearly sees the WTO as a way to force his
own economic and political reforms on the bloated, inert and
corrupt Chinese system. But we should have no illusions. Opponents
of this deal within China will fight an intense rearguard action
against it if China signs. Implementation will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that the biggest opposition in China is coming
from elements in China's national defense area who are saying to
Zhu, `You are putting us into a globalized world and we are going
to lose control,' '' says Michael Oksenberg, a Stanford University
China scholar.
</P>
<P>
   China is not going to be remade overnight, by this or any other
globalution deal. But China's joining the WTO would be a huge step
in the protracted process of opening up the Middle Kingdom and
easing its wrenching transition from Communism. It would be a
grievous error to miss this opportunity.

CHEBET FINDS FIRST PLACE A STEP UP THAT WAS WORTH IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- There are times when the marathoner has to hide the
disappointment, regroup in the lonely times when he is training,
grit his teeth, and say to himself, ``Second place isn't all that
bad, but what about first?'' Joseph Chebet discovered in his own
way that, to paraphrase Thomas Paine, these are the times that try
men's soles.
</P>
<P>
   How else to exult than with a monumental triumph in Monday's
103d running of the Boston Marathon? After all, he was second in
the New York City Marathon in 1997. He was second in Boston last
year, by three seconds, to fellow Kenyan Moses Tanui. He was second
in New York last year by three seconds to countryman John Kagwe.
Two major races, six seconds away from two victories.
</P>
<P>
   This is what made Monday very special, in a personal sense, as
Chebet seized the lead from Ecuadoran Silvio Guerra with a 4:43
mile just before they headed off Commonwealth Avenue in Brighton
onto the downhill stretch on Chestnut Hill Avenue for the final 4
miles of the 26-mile-285-yard course.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Chebet reached the finish line by the Boston Public
Library in the Back Bay, there was no change in the order. With
defender Tanui dropping out at virtually the same section where
Chebet made his decisive move, Chebet ran to victory in 2 hours, 9
minutes, and 52 seconds on an afternoon that saw bright sunlight
and favoring breezes at the start give way to a twisting wind that
slowed times as the runners headed home.
</P>
<P>
   Chebet's time was tied for only the 38th-fastest in the race's
history, but he won the world's oldest continuing marathon. Guerra,
who had threatened to run away and hide before reality set in, was
second in 2:10:19. Frank Pooe of South Africa, an 11th-hour entry
running in his first race outside his homeland, trailed in third in
2:11:37, followed by countryman Abner Chipu (2:12:46) and Kagwe
(2:13:58).
</P>
<P>
   Chebet, who ran 2:07:37 a year ago, was content to sit in a
shifting pack in the early miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a bit fast at 5 kilomoters,'' he said of the
15:22 pace established by Ethiopia's Tesfaye Bekele (20th, 2:21:20)
heading through Ashland.
</P>
<P>
   It remained for Kenyan Kenneth Cheruiyot to take it out through
the next 11 miles in his dutiful rabbit's role before dropping out
at the 17th mile. This is where Guerra moved to the front, opening
a lead of nearly 150 yards by the time he raced through 30
kilometers in 1:32:37. It was becoming time for Chebet to make his
move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I am not going to make the same time I did last
year,' '' said Chebet. ``I tried to talk to my competitors to tell
them to push the pace, but they were tired. I saw my fellow Kenyans
were not going to try to catch up. I said, `Maybe I should go. If
not, maybe I can be second.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line was that Chebet had to make his moves through
the Newton hills to avoid a fourth straight second place in major
marathons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pushed it hard,'' said Chebet.
</P>
<P>
   This left the pained Guerra in pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first half of the race was not too fast,'' said Guerra,
who made his marathon debut in Tokyo (2:14:02) in 1997. ``That's
why I decided to go out after 25 kilometers. I was feeling good. To
win a race, you have to take risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling great and strong, but I'm very new to marathons
and I'm just trying to learn how to run. That's why I left them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to win the race, but in a marathon anything can
happen. When I left, I just wanted to make a move and I didn't know
who was behind me. I turned back, and nobody was there. I pushed
hard, but after 20 miles I started to get blisters so I slowed
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Pooe found Boston to be ``a tough course'' for which you ``have
to be ready mentally and physically.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt to run well against the Kenyans you have to be clever
and save your energy to finish in a good position,'' he said. ``I
wasn't feeling too good in the last miles, so I dropped back on my
pace. I had to slow down. I think I'll come back and do it the next
time.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a race of attrition. Bill Rodgers dropped out at
Heartbreak Hill in his bid to set an American record for
50-and-over runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' he said, ``but I was struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   John Campbell of New Zealand, who had set a masters record (40
and over) with his 2:11:04 in 1990, also dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Jennings of Newmarket, N.H., was never a factor in her
official marathon debut at age 38, finishing 12th in 2:38:37.
</P>
<P>
   It remained for Chebet and the indefatigable Fatuma Roba of
Ethiopia (2:23:25) to take the final race of the 1900s and put it
away with comfortable margins of victory. There was no Tanui/Chebet
duel to the finish on Boylston Street.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, there were negative splits in the men's race _
Chebet passed through the half-marathon in 1:05:29, the second half
in 1:04:23 _ _ which doesn't happen often in Boston. But when
you've been second once too often, you have to turn it on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running second because of the way he was trying to push
the pace,'' said Chebet of the tactics employed by Guerra. ``I was
running by myself and the guy from South Africa and I didn't know
if we would catch up with him.''
</P>
<P>
   He did. And he won. Ever since Ibrahim Hussein won the first of
his three titles in 1988, Kenyans have captured 10 of 12 Boston
Marathons. (itals)Mambu Baddu.(unitals) The best is yet to come.

<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ She had practiced her lines and prayed with her
mother. She had bought her children new clothes. After 10 years on
welfare, Michelle Crawford was leaving her run-down home in the
central city to speak to the Legislature, at the governor's
personal request. She clenched her notes so tightly in the back of
the car that it seemed she was trying to choke them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not much of a talker,'' she said, drawing anxious breaths
and jumbling her words as the Wisconsin countryside flew past.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, she stole the show.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside the man she calls ``Government Thompson'' _
Wisconsin's governor, Tommy Thompson _ Ms. Crawford explained how
his showcase welfare program had transformed her life. ``Today, I'm
working as a machine operator, providing for my family,'' she said.
Then with flawless timing, she pointed at the gallery where three
of her children were watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' she said, holding an emphatic finger in the air, ``I
tell my kids that this is what you get when you do your homework.''
Ms. Crawford's prime-time, televised performance _ her poise, her
humor, her confident smile _ filled the chamber with cheers and
transformed her, after a life of defeat, into a potent symbol of
success. In one resonating moment, she became the most celebrated
beneficiary of the most closely watched welfare program in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last week, Thompson drew a burst of applause when
he retold ``her inspiring story'' to a room of conservative
supporters at a welfare conference in Washington. ``I want to run
for president,'' she recalls him saying when they met three months
ago, ``and I want you on my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crawford's odyssey, from desperation to distinction, from
welfare to work, is indeed a powerful, inspiring story. It is also
an incomplete one, at least in its official telling. In a series of
interviews over several months, Ms. Crawford offered a far more
complicated account depicting a life that is much more difficult
than her admirers realize and less steady than the governor may
have hoped.
</P>
<P>
   In sharing her fuller story _ in explicit, even harrowing detail
_ she said she wanted even the most troubled women to know that
they, too, can move forward. ``I want to tell other girls, hey, if
you're going through something, I've been there,'' she said. ``I've
had those things thrown in my face: `You'll never be nothing.'
There's women out there scared.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Legislature heard, Ms. Crawford, 39, is off welfare and
on the job at a plastics factory outside Milwaukee. Indeed, after
years of severe anxiety and depression, her diligent record
recently earned her a raise, to $8.20 an hour. But she continues to
struggle with panic attacks, unpaid bills, and barbs from
co-workers and relatives who envy her achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Thompson again praised the effect her work was having
on her children. But only a few days earlier, her 19-year-old son
threw her life into new turmoil when he was arrested, charged with
possessing cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, such pressures have overwhelmed Ms. Crawford. She
was hospitalized for a nervous breakdown as recently as a year ago,
and she said her troubles had been brought on in part by the
pressures of the very program _ Wisconsin Works, or ``W-2'' _ whose
virtues she now represents.
</P>
<P>
   Initially she resented being forced to work for her welfare
check, of $673 a month. ``To me, it was just like slavery,'' she
said. ``I couldn't be with my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most worrisome, Ms. Crawford's success has brought new
strains to a volatile marriage. Her husband of two years, Donald
Crawford, is an aspiring minister who plays New Testament tapes
when he drives her to work and warns, ``If you put God first in
your life, the Devil won't have time to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also a recovering addict who says he received the Holy
Ghost in prison three years ago, where he was facing a possible 30
years for his role in torturing a man he suspected of stealing
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   At least four times last year, the Crawfords' relationship
erupted in violence. Twice, Crawford was led away in handcuffs for
striking his wife, who has been beaten by a succession of men over
the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But once it was Ms. Crawford who was placed under arrest, for
hitting her husband in the head with an iron and threatening him
with a knife. ``I was going berserk,'' she said, in an argument
over money. She said she hit her husband to defend herself, after
he restrained her by grabbing her throat.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their fights, Crawford sometimes supports his wife's
work life, through prayers, rides and baby-sitting services. But he
also worries that his role as the breadwinner is being usurped. ``I
don't like it, because I'm the man of the house,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions in their life were on full display one recent
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the house, Ms. Crawford was frantically phoning for the
details of her son's arrest. Outside, Crawford angrily complained
that his wife had failed to tell her admirers about his
contributions to her success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled that lady in there out of a lot of rough stuff,'' he
said. ``Don't kick me to the curb, like `I did it all by myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   Worried that she would call the police again, he accused Ms.
Crawford of ``telling lies on me.'' He added darkly, ``I don't like
liars.''

46-YEAR-OLD TAKES WOMEN'S MASTERS HONORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Distance running is not a sport that you would usually
associate with France. It's not particularly popular there, in
terms of either participation or spectating.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Josette Colomb-Janin, of Les Eparres, France.
She wasn't interested in sports at all until she turned 35 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband Joseph, a marathoner who ran Boston last year,
convinced his wife to take up running by giving her sneakers for
her 35th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Colomb-Janin, now 46, loves the sport now. She won the women's
masters division Monday, placing 14th overall, with a 2:40:36
clocking. That was good enough to put $11,700 in her pocketbook _
$10,000 for winning the women's masters, $1,700 for her overall
finish.
</P>
<P>
   In her only other Boston Marathon, 1997, Colomb-Janin also took
the women's masters title, in 2:40:53.
</P>
<P>
   Her feet were hurting Monday, the result, she thought, of a race
two weeks ago in Paris where the surface was too hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel it was too easy, so I was very careful,'' said
Colomb-Janin. ``The weather was perfect, not too warm and not too
cold. I was very pleased with my time, though. In fact, I think
I'll come back next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like most about this event is the atmosphere. I
feel I'm still very quick, besides having the endurance to run
marathons.''
</P>
<P>
   Colomb-Janin spent two months preparing for Boston, training
during a noon-2 p.m. lunch break from her banking job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I run once a week, while most marathoners in my country go on
the road twice a week,'' she said. ``I'm just too busy with my
work. I do about 80 kilometers a week, or about 50 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband ran all the time as a youngster and then he stopped
before picking up the sport again. He knew that I never really
wanted to run, though. He kept talking to me about running more and
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then on my birthday, when I opened the birthday gift, I
went jogging for the first time. It was about 2,000 meters. And
then in my first marathon, that in 1994, I placed third in Lyon,
France, and I was our country's first finisher.''
</P>
<P>
   It has become a love affair.

   A Complex Case
</P>
<P>
   When Getting a Job Is Just the Middle
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week following his speech about Ms.
Crawford, Thompson said he knew nothing of her violent marriage,
her son's arrest or her history of emotional duress. When sharing
the stage with her in January, he said, he did not even know she
was married. At the time, Crawford was out of the house, under a
restraining order from a court.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a somber tone, Thompson said he was saddened but not
surprised, since many women on public assistance struggled with
similar issues. A four-term Republican who is seen as a national
leader on welfare, he went on to say that Ms. Crawford's problems
made her achievements all the more impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a richer story; it shows how complex and how difficult
this is,'' he said. ``People start out with some real difficulties,
emotionally as well as educationally and culturally. To overcome
these things, it's not easy dealing with human frailties. Michelle
is very much a success story and continues to be so, even more so
because she's been able to overcome these adversities.''
</P>
<P>
   Julia Taylor, the president of YW Works, a state-financed
welfare agency that offered Ms. Crawford a remarkable array of
services, views the story as a warning against the simplistic view
that ``all you have to do is go out and get a job.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``getting a job certainly helps,'' she said, policy-makers
should remember ``it doesn't make all the problems go away, and
sometimes it intensifies problems. The public needs to understand
how hard people's lives are.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her moments of panic and doubt, Ms. Crawford also draws
on reserves of uncommon, even eloquent, resilience. In pushing poor
women like herself to find their hidden talents, she said, Thompson
``did a good thing with W-2.''
</P>
<P>
   A Hard Start
</P>
<P>
   Abuse, a Miscarriage and Mental Illness
</P>
<P>
   The fourth of 13 siblings raised on welfare, Ms. Crawford has
struggled all her life. Her family moved to Milwaukee from Arkansas
when she was a child, on the tail of a vast migration of Southern
blacks chasing hope in the industrial North.
</P>
<P>
   But her father left their home when she was 7, and her mother
was still decades away from settling down. ``My mother was running
the streets,'' she said. ``When I was 15, I ran away. I told her I
wasn't taking care of all the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon she had children of her own. After an adolescence marred by
sexual abuse at the hands of a relative, Ms. Crawford left high
school, found a rough young man and followed him to Chicago. They
had a child when she was 18 and lost another a year later. ``He
beat it out of me,'' she said. ``It was a miscarriage.'' Two more
children followed, and too many beatings to count.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to Milwaukee and sought peace in pills _ the
devil's doing, as she sees it now. She drank. She battled urges to
hurt herself. Depleted in body and soul by the age of 24, she left
her children with her mother and entered a mental hospital. It took
her three years to grow strong enough to get her children back.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, when she met Donald Crawford in a training class for
welfare recipients, she had two more children, another violent
boyfriend, and a headful of worries. She admired Crawford from
across the room, but felt sure a man so tall and impressive _ 6
feet 2, with a wide, winning smile _ was already spoken for.
</P>
<P>
   He paired with her during interview rehearsals, showing her how
to impress an employer with a firm, confident grip. He drove her
home. He said he liked her. In 1996, he offered her a ring. ``I
thought he was joking,'' she said. ``Nobody ever wanted to marry
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Partner
</P>
<P>
   Struggles of His Own, and a Similar Past
</P>
<P>
   But Crawford had problems of his own. Like his wife, he came
from a large family of Arkansas migrants, with 11 siblings. Like
his wife, he dropped out of school and battled an addiction _
cocaine, in his case.
</P>
<P>
   Though his father had a steady life as a janitor and a preacher,
Crawford has been on and off welfare, and in and out of jobs. By
1996, he had found a sideline helping a nephew sell drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Early that year, they suspected a boarder of stealing their
cocaine. They stripped, bound and gagged the man, beat him with a
2-by-4, poured boiling water on his naked body and whipped him with
a cord, according to an account the man gave the police 10 days
later. Despite his injuries, the victim said he had stayed in the
house for a week after the assault, until Crawford, accusing him of
stealing a coat, assaulted him again.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford said his nephew was the main assailant, but
acknowledged, ``I had a hand in it.''
</P>
<P>
   On his knees in the cell where he was being held for the crime,
Crawford wept and prayed for divine intervention. ``I said, `Lord,
forgive me, it's all in your hands,'' he said. ``The Holy Ghost
came and filled me with the Spirit. Ever since then, nothing's
turned me around.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford was released a few weeks later. The victim, who told
the police he feared being killed if he testified, declined to
pursue the charges. Crawford proposed shortly after his release,
and Ms. Crawford accepted the following year. They married in July
1997.

 MILWAUKEE: July 1997.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Program
</P>
<P>
   After a Reluctant Start, Glad to Be Working
</P>
<P>
   The state began its bold remaking of the welfare system two
months later, requiring virtually everyone on cash assistance to
work for their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crawford was sent to a work site where her duties involved
picking up trash. She felt humiliated. After a life filled with
insults, she says, she felt as if the program equated her with the
garbage bags in her hand. ``It felt like they were punishing us,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Problems in the program collided with problems at home. Her
husband had rented an upstairs apartment to relatives who began
selling drugs. He got an eviction order. They got a gun. The
Crawfords constantly quarreled _ about his disruptive relatives,
her resentful children, and a pile of unpaid bills.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, Crawford was arrested for grabbing her by the
throat. In March, she went to jail for hitting him with the iron.
In May, she sought professional help, returning to a psychiatric
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a nervous breakdown,'' she said. ``I just didn't want to
live no more.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed next was an extraordinary collaboration, between a
creative agency and a tenacious client. YW Works, one of five
private agencies that run the welfare program in Milwaukee,
initially made Ms. Crawford's work assignment the pursuit of her
psychiatric care.
</P>
<P>
   After a month of intensive therapy, the agency sent her to a
plastics plant it had just bought to train poor clients. Though she
started in housekeeping, her supervisor noticed her unusual drive.
Others goofed off when vacuum cleaners broke, but Ms. Crawford
grabbed a broom. By August, the supervisor had promoted her onto
the assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   Not every day passed peacefully. Failing to take the medication
that helps control her mood swings, Ms. Crawford erupted one
morning and denounced her supervisor as a racist. He calmed her
down and sent her home, and by the next morning she was back on the
line, molding minnow buckets. ``They really put up with me,'' Ms.
Crawford said. ``They were like family to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, her supervisor drove her to a job interview, and she
fell to her knees when she was hired. ``I said, `Thank you, Jesus'
_ I'm going to be paying taxes, too!''
</P>
<P>
   When the governor toured the training plant in January, Ms.
Crawford was invited to join a group of clients meeting with him.
She gave him a hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir, I didn't like it _ but it worked for me,'' she said. A
few days later, Thompson startled his aides and Ms. Crawford by
inviting her to join him onstage at his annual State of the State
address. ``She is exuberant,'' he said. ``There was an instant
chemistry between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Six days after their first, brief encounter, Ms. Crawford was
standing before the Legislature. ``I thought I would always be on
welfare,'' she told her statewide audience. But now, ``my kids see
a difference in me,'' she said. ``I ask others to take a chance on
W-2 workers. We won't let you down.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the speech, Thompson recalled, ``There wasn't a
dry eye, including myself _ I even get teared up now when I talk
about it. It was just so emotional, so right, and so correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone thinks so. Her co-workers resent Ms. Crawford's
celebrity, and her mother and sister are furious. After failing to
comply with the work program, her sister was recently evicted, and
she matches Ms. Crawford's admiration for the governor with equally
potent spite. Her mother and sister ``hate Thompson's guts,'' Ms.
Crawford said. ``They said it's wrong to say those things about
W-2, because W-2 is messing up other people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, her husband, too, chafes at her prominence, and
the three children still living at home _ Lorenzo, 14, Lavita, 11,
and Yolando, 7 _ often chafe at her husband. ``I'm trying to go
straight in the Lord,'' he said. But his anger flared just a moment
later, when he noted that in her defining hour, Ms. Crawford
``didn't say nothing about me.''

   He was arrested last November, after another fight. But despite
the court order removing him from the home, Ms. Crawford let him
return after her speech. She praised him in a recent conversation,
saying, ``He doesn't hit women; he's a Christian man.'' In dreams,
she sometimes sees him in white, standing in a pulpit. ``We need
each other,'' she said. ``You just can't do things by yourself. You
need a helping hand.''
</P>
<P>
   She was scheduled to tell her story in Washington this week
before a congressional panel. She wanted to arrive in a limousine
and meet ``important people.'' But her son's drug arrest cost her
two days of work, and Ms. Crawford is sagging from the pressures of
the publicity. She plans to spend the day making plastic valves
instead, as she has through six months of crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like getting up in the morning, going to my job,'' she said.
``I just feel good about myself.''

ISRAEL ADOPTS COMPROMISE PLAN ON NAZARETH MOSQUE DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel has adopted a compromise plan to resolve a
violent dispute in Nazareth between Muslims and Christians. The
plan would allow a small mosque to be built next to a planned plaza
for millennium pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict over Muslim plans to build a large mosque on the
site of the plaza set off clashes for several days this month in
the Israeli Arab town, which is revered by Christians as the
boyhood home of Jesus. The Vatican and church leaders warned that
millennial celebrations there, including an expected visit by Pope
John Paul II, could be jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to avert further unrest and friction with the
Christian authorities, a committee of senior Israeli officials
decided on the compromise on Sunday after several unsuccessful
mediation efforts. Officials said that if the plan was rejected,
the government would press its case in court, where the dispute is
already being heard.
</P>
<P>
   The office of the Vatican's envoy to Israel declined to comment
on the plan Monday, but Muslim leaders in Nazareth rejected it,
setting the stage for perhaps weeks or even months of further
litigation before the government takes action.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a decision, not a proposal for negotiation,'' said
Motti Zaken, the prime minister's Arab affairs adviser. ``I'm happy
that the parties are not satisfied, because this is a compromise,
where no one is pleased but everyone can live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism Minister Moshe Katzav, the cabinet official responsible
for Arab affairs, predicted that ultimately ``both sides will
accept the solution, because the government has no other
proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute focuses on a half-acre of state-owned land near the
Basilica of the Annunciation, hallowed to Christians as the site
where the angel Gabriel told Mary that she was pregnant with a son.
The Nazareth municipality cleared the area 18 months ago for a
plaza to accommodate pilgrims expected for the celebrations of the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims set up a protest tent and held prayers at the site, next
to a structure revered as the tomb of Shihab a-Din, a 12th-century
Muslim leader who died in a Crusade battle. Asserting that the land
is the property of an Islamic trust, Muslim leaders announced plans
to build a sprawling mosque there.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute, which reflected a struggle between Nazareth's
Muslim majority and Christian minority over the character of the
city, erupted beginning on Easter Sunday. More than 20 people were
hurt, stones were thrown at Christian motorists and shops, and
stores were attacked with firebombs. Churches closed for two days
in protest, and the Vatican criticized the mosque scheme, calling
it a provocation.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government tried to mediate the dispute, offering
several solutions that were rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The plan presented Monday provides for a modest mosque at the
disputed site, while promising an alternative site in Nazareth for
a large mosque. The rest of the area will serve as a plaza for
millennium pilgrims, and will be vacated by the Muslim protesters,
according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has the support of Nazareth's Christian mayor, Ramez
Jeraysi, it was promptly rejected by local Muslim leaders, who hold
a one-vote majority in the city council.
</P>
<P>
   Salman Abu Ahmad, a leader of the Islamic Movement, which has
the majority in the council, denounced the government plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot give up sacred land that is an Islamic trust,'' Abu
Ahmad said. ``We will not leave this land. We will stay there and
continue our prayers.''

TWO EUROPEAN TELEPHONE GIANTS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Telecom Italia and Deutsche Telekom, two formerly
state-owned telephone giants of Europe, are expected to announce an
agreement as early as Tuesday to merge in a deal valued at about
$95.4 billion, creating the world's largest telecommunications
company.
</P>
<P>
   The combination, which the boards of the Italian and German
companies were still discussing on Monday night, would rank as the
biggest corporate deal in history. It also is the most stunning
example to date of corporate merger frenzies that are remaking
European businesses and the global telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   The companies had scheduled a news conference for Tuesday in
London to present the plan for a merger, then postponed it for what
they called organizational reasons. But their boards were planning
to meet Tuesday and people close to the talks said approval of the
deal was expected.
</P>
<P>
   Although the merger would face formidable obstacles, including
possible antimonopoly challenges by European Union regulators, it
is expected to set off a scramble by smaller telephone companies to
find partners.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said the combined companies could develop a
serious challenge to the overseas ambitions of some of America's
biggest phone companies trying to crack the European market.
</P>
<P>
   It also could presage a possible Deutsche Telekom takeover of
Sprint, the No. 3 long-distance company in the United States, the
one key market uncovered by the German-Italian merger plan.
Deutsche Telekom owns a 10 percent stake in Sprint and there was
speculation Tuesday that it might try to buy the rest.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Telecom Italia board said it had examined
``substantially, a merger of equals between Telecom Italia and
Deutsche Telekom, from which would emerge the second-largest global
telecommunications group'' by revenue. The board said it would
reconvene Tuesday ``to conclude its evaluations and to make
definitive decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger, if approved, would mark the first time that
two of Europe's formerly government-owned phone companies have come
together. Phone companies in Europe, like those in the United
States, have been joining forces to expand their markets and
increase their ability to compete around the world while cutting
costs.

U.S. PUSHES FOR ALLIED AGREEMENT ON CUTTING OFF FUEL TO SERBS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States, eager to cut off fuel supplies
to Serb military forces, pressed NATO allies Monday to agree on
inspection and enforcement procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's important that, working through the alliance,
that we choke off any efforts of oil being brought in from the
outside,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomatic and defense officials proposed boarding and
searching ships in the Adriatic Sea for cargo that might buttress
the war effort of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic against
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department did not rule out a naval blockade, but
Clinton administration officials indicated they hoped to stop short
of that formal step, which is an act of war under international
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the NATO alliance we are looking at a variety of things
to try to take steps to increase the pressure on Milosevic's
military supplies and try to get at the grip by which he represses
Kosovo,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats were reluctant to discuss resistance to the plan
within NATO, but administration officials indicated problems
remained with the French, Italians and Greeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the Balkans, Milosevic's military forces, who had been
herding Kosovar refugees toward Albania and Macedonia, closed
border crossing points without warning or explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of allied governments were at a loss to explain where
the long line of refugees, who had been waiting just inside Kosovo
over the weekend, had gone but said it was yet another ominous
sign.
</P>
<P>
   On the diplomatic front, President Clinton talked with President
Boris Yeltsin of Russia by telephone for 45 minutes, their first
conversation since the bombing started 28 days ago Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said the leaders' discussion included the prospect
that Russian troops would join an international peacekeeping force
in Kosovo after a cease-fire and withdrawal of Serb forces.
Russians are already part of a similar multinational force in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said he will soon go to Moscow
for consultations with Russian leaders, who have strongly condemned
NATO's assault on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said he would not be carrying any specific new peace
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Yeltsin reaffirmed his public statements that
Russia ``won't be drawn into this conflict.'' Yeltsin had announced
earlier Monday that additional Russian Navy vessels would not be
sent to the Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also asked Congress for $6 billion in emergency spending
for the Balkans conflict, most of it for the U.S.-led NATO military
operations but with some humanitarian funding for ethnic Albanian
refugees who have fled Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are literally lives hanging in the balance,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke over the weekend with French President Jacques
Chirac, and apparently they discussed cutting off Milosevic's oil
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters news agency quoted a French foreign ministry official in
Paris as saying that France was well aware it was crucial to stop
the flow of oil to Yugoslavia but said that a legal basis had to be
found.
</P>
<P>
   Halting oil tankers could require a new U.N. resolution, the
French government sources said, but the Clinton administration
contended no new U.N. authorization was needed to crack down on oil
shipments that could benefit Serb troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basis is that there already is a United Nations'
resolution banning any importing of military supplies,'' Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was complicated by the fact that Milosevic's only
seaport is in Montenegro, Yugoslavia's nominally pro-Western
republic.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said allied airstrikes ``have taken
out about 70 percent of the (Yugoslav) military supplies of fuel.''
He said Milosevic's army ``is hurting now because of a lack of oil,
both of supplies and the ability to distribute it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency said air raid sirens
sounded Monday night in the capital of Belgrade and that airstrikes
were reported in other regions, including Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a reporter at the alliance daily briefing at
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, to reflect on what will soon be
a monthlong air campaign, NATO spokesman Shea said the operation
would not be judged by the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more just your cause is, the longer you're justified in
pursuing that cause, obviously,'' Shea said. ``The strategy is
going to work. It's working at the moment.''

IN NERVOUS JASPER, A THIRD OF STUDENTS ARE KEPT OUT OF SCHOOL 
 

</HEADLINE>

c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ There were no bombs in Jasper on Monday. No
rallies, no marches, no threats, nothing. A handwritten sign taped
inside the front door of the Jasper County Courthouse casually
reminded the last person out to lock up.
</P>
<P>
   But in this East Texas town made famous by last summer's
dragging death of a black man, nerves are still jangled. On top of
that, Monday was the anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing and
the Branch Davidian fire in Waco, and Tuesday is a pretrial hearing
for the second of three white men accused in the murder of James
Byrd Jr.
</P>
<P>
   For many, it was just too much. So they kept their kids home
from school.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 1,080 students, or 32 percent of those enrolled in
Jasper's two elementary schools, the middle school and the high
school, were absent when the bell rang Monday morning, or were
picked up by parents shortly after classes started, said Doug
Koebernick, superintendent of the Jasper Independent School
District.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand parents hold their children very dearly,''
Koebernick said. ``But there have been no threats, no problems at
all. The weather is beautiful, and we are having a great day at
school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted the peace of mind,'' said Shannan Holmes, who
sent her 8-year-old daughter, Meagan, to the baby sitter with her
little brother instead of to second grade at Parnell Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's all kinds of nasty rumors going around, but I just
thought it was better to be safe. It's just one day. She can go
back tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The rumors started circulating several weeks ago after officials
at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice intercepted two letters
from a prison inmate who is a member of the Aryan Circle, a racist
prison gang. The inmate was once imprisoned with John William
``Bill'' King, a 24-year-old white supremacist who was convicted in
Byrd's dragging murder and sentenced to death earlier this year,
and with King's co-defendant, Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr., 32,
whose pretrial hearing is scheduled for this morning.
</P>
<P>
   The letters, intended for two other inmates, discussed a
``family reunion and annual Jasper tractor pull and drag racing
event'' that was to take place on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray earlier had cited
the date of the Oklahoma City bombing and the Waco fire in
rescheduling Brewer's change of venue hearing from Monday to
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI investigated the letter-writing inmate and alerted
Jasper authorities, who added more patrols as a precaution, Jasper
Police Chief Stanley Christopher said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Christopher insisted he had not received any other threats
of violence and urged parents to send their children back to
school. His own son went to high school Monday, and his grandson
was in day care, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all rumor,'' he said, clearly exasperated. ``There are
no threats. There are no bombs. We have not received any word of
any rallies or demonstrations by the KKK or the Black Panthers or
anybody. There is nothing to substantiate any of these rumors.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Superintendent Koebernick said parents started calling him at
home Sunday night, and he and other administrators tried to assure
them that the schools had not been threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lout, owner of local radio station KJAS 107.3, said several
parents called him Sunday night, asking about rumors of bomb
threats at the schools and at Wal-Mart. None was true, he told
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one call at 2:30 this morning, and another at 4 a.m.,
parents wanting to know if the schools were going to be open, and
if I thought it would be safe to send their kids,'' Lout said. ``I
told them I didn't see any reason why it wouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after several assuring radio reports on Monday morning,
worried parents continued to call the station, he said, asking
whether they should go pick up their kids.
</P>
<P>
   Koebernick said he was hopeful that the students would return to
school Tuesday, even though Brewer, who goes on trial May 17, will
make an appearance at the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one anniversary, and the anniversary is today,''
the superintendent said. ``We expect that all the kids will be back
in school tomorrow.''

   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Refugees arriving in Macedonia from Kosovo
are increasingly reporting rapes and killings by Yugoslav forces,
international observers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees arriving in recent days from the area around Gnijlane
in southeastern Kosovo have related stories of summary executions
and of a mass grave in the area they passed through, said an
official of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the European group have been interviewing
refugees to try to document reports of atrocities against the
Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The reports, if true, would represent a worsening of the
situation for civilians fleeing to Macedonia, the official said.
``In particular in the last three to four days, we have had stories
of summary executions,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Albanian refugees have flooded in from Kosovo over
the last few days, in a second wave of mass expulsions conducted by
Yugoslav forces. This wave appears to be slower than the first, in
which 50,000 refugees were forced out in 48 hours, but may prove
more deadly, the European official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is slower, and more systematic,'' he said. ``We are now
getting reports of mass graves, which is an indication that it is
getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   After surging over the weekend, the flow of refugees out of
Kosovo slowed dramatically Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the first wave of refugees here, largely from Pristina, the
Kosovo capital, and the city of Urosevac, there was only one report
of young men being separated and taken away, a European official
said, and most of the young men from Pristina were allowed to
leave. But reports that men are being separated from their families
and not allowed to leave with them are increasing.
</P>
<P>
   The early refugees had reported killings by Serbian security
forces, but in small numbers. ``I had the impression that in the
first wave they did not have time'' to commit systematic killing,
the European official said of the Serbian security forces.
</P>
<P>
   European officials said that in seven interviews recently,
including one with an alleged victim, refugees had reported rapes
by Yugoslav troops or police personnel.
</P>
<P>
   In the other six cases, the refugees said they had witnessed
rapes. One described a rape and the brutal killing of the victim.
Another described seeing the rapes of several women by soldiers or
members of the Serbian police.
</P>
<P>
   The European group has a team of 50 observers working in refugee
camps and villages in Macedonia, interviewing and trying to
document reports of human rights abuses. Another 77 are working in
Albania. The officials said the team members are being meticulous
in gathering documentation and trying to double-check the reports.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence will be offered to the tribunal at The Hague,
Netherlands, that is prosecuting Balkan war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   One European official, who is preparing an internal report
documenting the level of atrocities, described the situation in
Kosovo as ``absolutely lawless,'' with reports of abuses by
Yugoslav civilians as well as soldiers and police personnel. The
official said there were very few reports of police or army
personnel or Serbian friends offering help or protection to Kosovo
Albanians who were threatened with violence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In one report, a person was reported to have been killed for
refusing to leave for the border, the European officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the office of the U.N. high commissioner for
refugees said Monday that they feared that Yugoslav forces were
again preventing tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians from fleeing
Kosovo.

   After a wave of 30,000 refugees poured out of Kosovo during one
24-hour period last weekend, only several hundred refugees from
Kosovo crossed into Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro on Monday,
the refugee agency officials reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''It all seems very ominous,'' said Kris Janowski, a spokesman
for the office of the high commissioner. ``Before there were tens
of thousands of people who were terrified and fleeing, and now
you've got this invisible curtain that has descended where no one
crosses.''
</P>
<P>
   The few refugees who did manage to arrive in Macedonia reported
seeing Yugoslav forces blocking Albanians from leaving Kosovo.
Systematic attacks on Albanian villages, which refugees said were
intensifying last week in southeastern Kosovo, were now being
carried out against Albanian villages near Pristina, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Adem Kacori, a bus driver who arrived here Monday with his
8-year-old son, said five villages north of Pristina _ Barilevo,
Milevc, Leban, Pugovc and Ovenovac _ had been burned by Yugoslav
forces in the last three days.
</P>
<P>
   Two refugees from the Pristina area reported seeing villages
burning around Pristina during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees continued to describe nightmarish scenes inside Kosovo.
One of the refugees said the body of a man who was shot dead in
front of her home in Pristina lay in the street for four days
because no one dared venture outside to retrieve it. Her sons, she
said, were terrified by the thunderous concussions of NATO bombs
and the endless rifle fire from Serbian paramilitaries.

REFRESHED KUZNETSOV TAKES MEN'S MASTERS HONORS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON -- This time, unlike last year, Andrey Kuznetsov was much
more comfortable with his hotel arrangements. He didn't have to
sleep in the lobby of the hotel _ the Fairmont Copley Plaza _ for a
night, Saturday evening, upon finally getting his visa to come to
Boston to run the Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he had his own bed, telephone, shower area throughout
his stay. Life was much more comfortable this time.
</P>
<P>
   There was no difference in the result, though. Kuznetsov won the
masters for the second consecutive year. Monday, in seven place
overall, Kuznetsov _ from Havarovsk, Russia and living in
Gainesville, Fla. the last three months _ had a 2:14.20 time.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Kuznetsov, 41, has beefed up his bank account a
bunch, with $19,000 _ $10,000 for his masters crown and $9,000 for
the place. He is considered the world's best masters runner.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in his first year as a masters, he won five masters
marathons _ in Houston, Grandma's, Twin Cities, Ocean State as well
as Boston _ his total prize money $51,150. He was 15th overall in
Boston with the third best time at 2:15.27.
</P>
<P>
   This year's time is better, a new third best at the Boston
marathon. Kuznetsov's best marathon was at 2:12.31, that in Monaco
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first half of the race was easy for me, but in the second
half, I tried to run faster to get better results, but with the
mountains and the hills, my legs were heavy,'' Kuznetsov said. ``I
was happy with my results. This year, though, the wind with a
little more to my face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into the race, I felt very well, very confident. I was
ready to run, figuring that I would run about 2:12 or 2:14,
depending on the weather conditions. Every mile was faster, about
five minutes or so in the second half. I could catchup, but it was
a little too fast. I started to feel the tiredness.''
</P>
<P>
   In his last marathon, in Houston in mid-January, Kuznetsov won
with a 2:19.56. ``I wanted to get closer to my personal record,
that was one of my goals,'' he stated of Monday's run. ``I love the
track here, and the people are very nice. The general environment
is very welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuznetsov has been a serious runner since age 26. Before that,
he preferred cross country skiing. And now he runs six marathons a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the only running I do, though,'' added Kuznetsov,
who lives in Florida with his wife, Olga, and two daughters. ``I
run different races between them, about three or four other runs,
just not as long.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerning last year's hotel difficulty, it wasn't Kuznwetsov's
fault. ``It was the decision of the people who work in the American
Embassy,'' said Kuznetsov, who continues to coach youngsters in his
Russian hometown. ``They gave me a hard time. I went to Jamaica and
won overall there, with the course record. And then the American
Embassy didn't give me a visa.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I was forced to go from Jamaica in my shorts and t-shirt in
February in the freezing wind. I couldn't go back home, though,
because it's seven times zones different, can you imagine now many
thousands of miles that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I fought for my visa and rather than trying to go back and
training in Russia in the snow and ice. I got my visa to come here
very late, two days before the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Kuznetsov will go for his third consecutive Boston
Marathon in the masters division. Room service in his hotel
throughout his stay.

 BRUSSELS, Belgium: somewhat lower.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wearing his flight suit, Leaf explained that the episode began
about 12:30 p.m. local time, when a pair of U.S. F-16s observed
ethnic Albanian villages being set on fire north of Djakovica.
Their call sign was ``Bear 21.'' The episode was first documented
last week at NATO when alliance officials took the unusual step of
playing a taped interview with one of these F-16 pilots.
</P>
<P>
   A F-16 pilots in ``Bear 21'' saw people running from a house
that burst into flames and jumping onto a vehicle, which NATO
officials said may have been a tractor. Believing that they had set
the house on fire, he attacked the vehicle with a laser-guided
bomb, destroying it.
</P>
<P>
   Another bomb was later dropped north of the town in an attack by
a different group of F-16s. Serb television later showed destroyed
tractors at that site, raising the possibility of civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's principal disclosure, however, was of the attack later in
the day south of the town on a large convoy of more than 100
vehicles. That raid involved several sets of aircraft, including
F-16s, French Jaguars, OA-10 observers, as well as a flying
airborne command and control aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Another important link was NATO's command center in Vicenza,
Italy _ known at the Combined Air Operations Center- which is
coordinating the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The raids on this column began when two F-16s, code-named ``Bear
31,'' saw the convoy. From the start, the F-16 pilots were worried
about the possibility of civilian casualties. With many villages
aflame, there was reason to think that many refugees might be on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf said the pilots in ``Bear 31'' had an ``extensive
discussion'' with the ABCCC command plane about whether the convoy
was a civilian or military target. It was not easy for the pilots
to identify the vehicles from the high altitude they generally fly
at to avoid Serbian anti-aircraft artillery.
</P>
<P>
   And while F-16s incorporate advanced military technology, these
systems have their limits. Potential targets are shown in the F-16
cockpit on a special display, which is about 4.5 inches wide and
4.5 inches long. The targets are not shown in color, but in shades
of green.
</P>
<P>
   An F-16 pilot has to look out the cockpit to see the color of
the vehicles below him, an important factor since military vehicles
are often painted dark green. He cannot use binoculars because the
cockpit is too small, a military official said.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case of the ``Bear 21'' F-16 patrol north of
Djakovica, the ``Bear 31'' F-16s were flying air controllers, whose
mission was not only to carry out strikes but to coordinate attacks
by other allied planes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite worries about refugees on the road, a number of factors
led ``Bear 31'' to conclude they were observing a military column.
The 20 or so vehicles at the front appeared to be traveling in
formation, with a set distance between them. They were moving
quickly, leading the pilots to believe they were not tractors.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the ABCCC command and control alerted the planes that
the convoy was made up of Yugoslav military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The two F-16s attacked the convoy, destroying one vehicle. They
called in strikes by two French Jacquar planes, which missed the
convoy.
</P>
<P>
   The F-16s ran low on fuel and were replaced by another pair of
F-16 planes, codenamed ``Bear 41,'' which came under Serb
anti-aircraft fire.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, there was an ominous warning. After twenty minutes of
bombing against the convoy, the command center in Italy wanted the
planes to check the targets again and make sure that they were
military.
</P>
<P>
   Military intelligence experts at the command center were dubious
that Serbian forces would be driving down an open road in such a
long convoy. They had been hiding and hunkering down for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   To get a better look ``Bear 41'' asked for help from a pair of
OA-10s, code-named ``Cub,'' which had been flying over eastern
Kosovo. The plane is slower and its pilot use binoculars to pick
out targets.
</P>
<P>
   The OA-10s reported that military vehicles had been struck, but
that civilian vehicles also seemed to be present. By then seven
laser-guided bombs had been aimed at a convoy south of Djakovica,
though not all of them hit their mark.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf still insists that some military vehicles were hit. Others
appear to have been tractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we watch these videos in the comfort of this room and on a
large display it appears possible the vehicles are tractors _ or
tractor-type vehicles,'' he said. ``As I reviewed the tapes with
the pilots, they agreed. However, they were emphatic that from the
attack altitude, to the naked eye, they appeared to be military
vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf acknowledged that British Harrier pilots had seen a convoy
and identified it as containing refugees. This happened at about
the same time as the attacks on the convoy were being carried out,
but Leaf said the Harriers were ``not in communication with the
aircraft in question.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior allied officer said the episode had NATO commanders
order a re-examination of procedures for finding and identifying
targets. But worried about Serbian anti-aircraft fire, the alliance
appears intent on continuing high-altitude strikes for now.

   &LR; NEW YORK _ In a stunning reversal, investors piled out of
technology stocks and other market darlings on Monday, pummeling
the very shares that propelled the broad market averages to records
last week.
</P>
<P>
   After rising 271.8 points, or 2.6 percent, during the morning,
the Dow Jones industrial average ran out of steam shortly after
noon and ended the day down 53.4 points on the day, or a
half-percent, at 10,440.53.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq market started the day in negative territory and
never climbed out as investors fled the computer, Internet and
telecommunications stocks that they had favored. The Nasdaq
Composite, home to most of the nation's technology companies, fell
138 points, or 5.6 percent, to close at 2,345.61. That was the
composite's second steepest fall in points but only its seventh in
percentage terms. Its largest point decline took place on Aug. 31,
at the height of the Russian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange exceeded 1.2 billion
shares, the second-heaviest trading day in exchange history. Nasdaq
trading volume was also brisk, at 1.198 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, investors took refuge in stocks whose fortunes
rise and fall with the economy, but even those shares began to
sputter at the close. ``This kind of a sharp and dramatic reversal
is not just business as usual,'' said Byron R. Wien, an investment
strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``There's a message here.
The message is everything finally began to sell off from sheer
exhaustion.''
</P>
<P>
   Though oil prices rose in the morning, there was no fundamental
event that caused the noontime reversal in the Dow average.
Instead, the shift from the glamour stocks of technology, health
care, Internet and telecommunications companies _ a phenomenon that
began last week _ simply gained momentum on Monday. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's/Barra Growth stock index _ a collection of companies with
high growth rates and lofty stock valuations _ has fallen 10
percent in the past five trading days.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest losers Monday were stocks that had
previously seemed to levitate. Even after Monday's collapse, these
shares are trading at high prices based on their earnings and are
well above their lows. America Online, for example, fell $26.9375
to close at $115.875. Although that is down more than 30 percent
from its high of April 6, the shares are now where they were just
about a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   And Charles Schwab Corp., a brokerage concern that is a favorite
Internet play because of its online trading services, closed down
32 percent from its high of one week ago. Still, it is up 81
percent since the start of the year. Reflecting the overall damage
done to Internet stocks, the American Stock Exchange's Internet
index is down 18 percent from its high of last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Proving once again that the market's leadership can change on a
dime, investors last week began to realize that excessive
valuations in stocks posed more risk than they could comfortably
accept. Rather than flee stocks entirely, they shifted to shares of
some companies that had been left for dead. Previously unglamourous
companies such as United Technologies Corp, a maker of heating and
air conditioning systems, elevators and jet engines; 3M, an
industrial products maker, and Smurfit-Stone Container, a paper
manufacturer, registered impressive gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors had the idea that it's a new economy and a new stock
market and that meant you don't have to worry about the old rules
of diversification and quality,'' said Alan F. Skrainka, chief
market strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   No longer.
</P>
<P>
   The move away from growth stocks with high valuations and into
companies that are viewed as cheaper began last week. Market
strategists pointed to two events that gave investors pause. The
first was the European Central Bank's move on April 8 to cut
interest rates, a signal that policymakers are committed to keeping
the world on a path to economic growth by jumpstarting Europe's
economies.
</P>
<P>
   Why would this send growth stock investors running for cover?
``When growth is scarce, investors don't want to own stocks whose
fortunes are hostage to the economy,'' explained Skrainka. ``But
when growth is plentiful, the tide lifts all boats, and that may be
what we're facing as global economies start to pick up.''
</P>
<P>
   The second scare for growth stock investors came last Monday
when Compaq Computer warned that its quarterly earnings would be
half what Wall Street analysts had been expecting. This reminded
traders that technology, for all its promise, can also disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to investor concern about growth stocks in general and
technology stocks in particular, was the news on Friday that Robert
Stansky, the manager of Fidelity's Magellan fund, had sold large
positions in many of the hot technology stocks that had been his
biggest holdings. Stansky moved into more mundane stocks that were
trading at lower premiums to their earnings growth rates, so-called
value shares.
</P>
<P>
   Stock traders noted Monday that there were so few buyers for
most stocks that sellers could get out only if they accepted prices
well below the prevailing market. Some stocks fell sharply even
though a relatively few shares exchanged hands.
</P>
<P>
   Companies waiting in the wings to offer their shares to the
public for the first time were likely losers in Monday's market
decline as well. Three internet concerns, Net Perceptions Inc.,
Proxicom Inc., and Launch Media Inc., had planned initial public
offerings this week. Until investors become more hospitable to
companies like these, such offerings will remain on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Market strategists pointed to the hordes of rapid-fire
daytraders, many of whom are relative newcomers to stocks but who
have yet to experience a severe decline in stock prices. In recent
months, these traders have created significant momentum and profits
as they piled into stocks. Now that they are piling out, they are
likely to create tidal waves of selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case where a lot of these stocks have some
unreasonable gains,'' said Lazslo Birinyi, who heads his own stock
research company in Greenwich, Conn. ``Now people are starting to
lock in the gains when they can. As these stocks decline from their
highs, the movement feeds on itself.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Longtime traders worry that a flood of calls from brokerage
companies will go out to stock investors on Tuesday for more funds
to prop up diminished portfolios that they have borrowed against to
buy more stocks. Customers must meet these requests, known as
margin calls, with fresh money or with cash raised by selling
stocks. If shares are sold, the market decline could accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Ameritrade, a large discount brokerage firm,
acknowledged that it had slightly higher margin calls than normal
on Monday, adding that it had no discernible problems with trading.
She also noted that the brokerage firm had previously imposed
higher borrowing limits, presumably lessening the number of margin
calls that would go out to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, investors could jump back into their former stock
market darlings if they judge the selling to be overdone. Such a
strategy has served them well over the last five years and was
especially shrewd when the market rebounded from its correction
last October. Microsoft, for example, which was down 6.5 percent
Monday, announces its earnings Tuesday. Investors may like what
they see and bid the stock back up again.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Wien, of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said that the
United States stock market remained overvalued and that the broad
market averages would experience a correction, defined by traders
as a decline of 20 percent. ``What you're seeing is a resolution of
excessive valuation in the market. I expect the indexes to decline
further, but I don't think we're in a bear market.''

PILOTS RELY ON CAMERA AND THEIR OWN EYES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Peering down at the ground from 15,000 feet or
higher, NATO pilots like those who appear to have attacked
civilians in Kosovo by mistake last week rely on technology and
their own eyesight to identify targets, but ultimately they make
judgment calls under trying conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Military pilots said in interviews that while they were usually
able to differentiate between broad classes of vehicles from those
altitudes _ a tank from a car, for example _ it was very difficult
to pick out details or to make an identification with 100 percent
certainty.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking pilots rely on three basic types of information in
identifying targets. They are in radio contact with communications
aircraft and spotter planes, which help guide them to potential
targets. They have heat-sensing infrared cameras that allow them to
magnify fuzzy pictures of what is on the ground. And they have
their own eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But identifying targets is complicated by the altitudes and
speeds at which the pilots fly, as well as by weather and combat
conditions _ including the possibility that enemy troops are using
civilian vehicles or using civilians as shields.
</P>
<P>
   In the Balkans conflict, NATO pilots have been flying fairly
high _ 15,000 feet and above _ to avoid ground fire.
</P>
<P>
   One U.S. Air Force F-16 pilot likened the experience to bungee
jumping from the top of a building and trying to pick out details
on the ground during the descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the job and you get used to that, but it's
extremely difficult to put a lay person in that situation and have
them understand the complexity,'' the pilot said.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the actions of NATO pilots in attacking two convoys in
Kosovo last week, Brig. Gen. Dan Leaf of the U.S. Air Force, the
commander of an air wing at Aviano Air Base in Italy, said in
Brussels, Belgium, on Monday that distinguishing a tractor from a
military truck is harder than it might appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we watch these videos in the comfort of this room and on a
large display, it appears possible the vehicles are tractors or
tractor-type vehicles,'' Leaf said after playing back cockpit
videos of one of the convoy attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I reviewed the tapes with the pilots, they agreed,'' he
said. ``However, they were emphatic that from the attack altitude,
to the naked eye, they appeared to be military vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf said that a pilot in another warplane used high-powered
binoculars to study the convoy that was being attacked and that the
pilot concluded that the convoy included military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   NATO provided a glimpse of what an attacking pilot is going
through when it released an audiotape last week of the debriefing
of a pilot involved in one of the convoy attacks.
</P>
<P>
   On the tape, the F-16 pilot described making a series of passes
just after midday over an area of Kosovo in which he saw villages
burning.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot described seeing ``three uniformly shaped dark green
vehicles, look like deuce-and-a-half troop carrying vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he went in ``on two passes to get a close look, both
with my eyeballs and with my targeting pod _ IR picture.'' He
subsequently dropped a laser-guided bomb that he said destroyed one
of the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The infrared, or IR camera to which he referred, is part of a
targeting device contained in a military system known as Lantirn.
The system was developed to provide low-altitude navigation and
night-time targeting, but it is routinely used by fighter pilots
for targeting during daytime as well. Its heat-sensing infrared
camera is able to pick out targets from a distance of up to 25,000
feet but not to display them as sharply as a television camera.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots say they are trained to recognize vehicles that they are
likely to encounter in a combat area, particularly tanks and troop
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But because of their speed and altitude, pilots say they also
rely on their infrared targeting device, which provides them with a
magnified picture on a 4 1/2-inch by 4 1/2-inch screen that sits by
their knee in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Because it makes images based on heat rather than light, the
targeting device is particularly useful at night. But it also has a
number of advantages for pilots in daylight, including allowing
them to pick out vehicles that have been camouflaged, to keep the
picture centered on the screen even as they pass by and turn, and
to magnify the image substantially.
</P>
<P>
   But the picture the system provides is not crystal clear, and
its usefulness is limited in wet weather.

BLASTING OF BRIDGES OUTRAGES NOVI SAD'S CITIZENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NOVI SAD, Serbia _ Army-green barges ferry people across the
Danube now, under what would have been the shadow of the Varadinski
Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the morning of April 1, NATO planes destroyed both
spans of the bridge, which linked Novi Sad, Serbia's second-largest
city, with Petrovaradin and its famous medieval fortress, which
hugs the heights commanding the river. On April 3, NATO planes
destroyed a second, newer bridge, leaving one narrow span _ though
damaged in one lane _ for vehicle and railroad traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage has also completely blocked the Danube, trapping
dozens of ships and tons of freight on either side of Novi Sad,
about 50 miles northwest of Belgrade. Every year about 10 million
tons of goods, mostly grain, coal and ores, travel up and down the
Danube.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said the bridges were a crucial resupply link
from rich northern Vojvodina to Yugoslav forces fighting in
southern Kosovo. But Serbian officials _ and outraged citizens _
saw the destruction of the bridges as the beginning of what they
consider to be NATO's targeting of civilian infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Students in Novi Sad, the capital of Vojvodina province, began a
protest campaign, including a nightly vigil on the last remaining
bridge, to try to keep NATO from destroying that one too.
</P>
<P>
   For Nenad Kotovic, 25, a literature student with muscular
dystrophy, the loss of the bridges is more than a civic or cultural
tragedy. He is supposed to get regular treatment at a hospital in
Petrovaradin, he said Monday, ``and how must I go there?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he admits, he still can get there, but with enormous
difficulty. Traffic is restricted on the last of Novi Sad's
bridges, and people are so crammed onto the ferry, standing all the
way, that it worsens his illness, Kotovic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is useless destruction,'' he said. ``What have these
bridges to do with Kosovo? It's just a form of torture for the
Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Kosovo itself, he said, Serbia would keep ``what has been
ours for centuries.'' Asked about the reports of the expulsion of
ethnic Albanians, he said, ``It is NATO that has destroyed the
friendship between the two peoples.'' No ethnic purging then? ``I
don't know,'' he finally said. ``I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Kotovic spoke by the edge of the bridge, where it disappears
into the water. On what remains, there is a display of sculpture:
large papier-mache skulls; two wolves locked in combat, one biting
the throat of the other; and a Giacometti-like figure holding what
appears to be a sacrificed Paschal lamb, a reference to the recent
Orthodox Easter.
</P>
<P>
   Kotovic was drawn here out of curiosity when he saw a busload of
journalists scurrying around. Brought on another of the Yugoslav
Army Press Center's tours of NATO bomb damage, the reporters were
told by their minders: ``This is a group regime. No one is allowed
to work on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   But as usual, the minders were not terribly strict, though time
here was short. The purpose of the visit was to show the damage
inflicted early Monday morning, by a NATO missile, to a lovely
modernist building, constructed in the late 1930s, that houses the
Vojvodina provincial government.
</P>
<P>
   The missile nearly missed the building, hitting the top floor
and causing moderate damage, though a lot of glass was broken
throughout and plaster fell in huge chunks from ceilings. A chunk
of beige missile, with a red stripe, bore the number EB02318. It
hit at about 1:30 a.m., when the building was empty, and no one was
hurt, the authorities said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When reporters arrived Monday, employees were carting out
computers and electric typewriters. They had also salvaged a metal
bust of Tito, whose Yugoslavia has been dismembered over the last
10 years of fratricide.
</P>
<P>
   There seemed no question in the minds of the Serbian authorities
that the missile might have been aimed to hit something else; there
were no other obvious targets nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The damage outraged the head of the province's executive
council, Bosko Perosevic, who called it ``an attack on Europe
itself, on one of the finest administrative buildings in Europe.''
He called it ``a special shame for the European countries of NATO''
and insisted that it was ``a purely civilian building.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no evidence that the building contained anything other
than offices. Dr. Zdenka Milosavljevic, who runs the social welfare
and health department, was clearing out personal effects from her
office, which was carpeted with broken glass and plaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We protect human beings here and their human rights,'' she
said furiously. ``You see what they've done to us. What's the point
of hitting these offices? What were they thinking?''

   HAT CREEK, Calif. _ The uninitiated crack jokes. They mention
``The X-Files'' and little green men. They wonder if he attends
alien-abductee conventions. They have a good old time.
</P>
<P>
   William Welch just shrugs. It is not his job to convince
skeptics of the possibility of intelligent life beyond this planet.
As the first professor to hold the University of California at
Berkeley's Watson and Marilyn Alberts Chair for the Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence _ the first academic chair of its
kind anywhere _ Welch has the job of scouring the universe to find
humanity's neighbors out there, somewhere, light-years away.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in front of an array of 10 radiotelescopes at the
university's Hat Creek Observatory near Mount Lassen here in
Northern California, Welch neither looked nor sounded like a
starry-eyed optimist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will we find intelligent life in space in my lifetime?'' he
said. ``It's a very remote possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, exciting discoveries of the existence of planets around
other stars continually kindle hopes among scientists of one day
finding advanced civilizations in the dark recesses of the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Welch is far from alone: a growing community of
scientists is devoting time and energy to the search for
extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI (pronounced SET-ee), as the
field is commonly called.
</P>
<P>
   But while those committed to the endeavor include some of the
world's leading astronomers, working at universities like Berkeley,
Harvard and Cornell, the new SETI chair, endowed with $500,000 from
two Berkeley alumni, is giving the field new public notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chair is a recognition that this is a serious endeavor,''
said Welch, a longtime professor of astronomy and electrical
engineering who has been conducting SETI research for years.
``Scientists know it's a worthwhile pursuit, but this makes it
known to the wider public.''
</P>
<P>
   To Frank Drake, president of the SETI Institute in Mountain
View, Calif., who is the pioneer in the field, the SETI chair at
Berkeley is proof positive that the search for extraterrestrial
life has entered the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an affirmation,'' said Drake, a professor of astronomy at
the University of California at Santa Clara who 40 years ago first
used a radiotelescope to search for patterns in radio signals from
space that would indicate they had been produced by alien
civilizations. ``Back in 1960, SETI was way out there. Things have
gotten a lot better. The attitude in the scientific community is
that yes, there's life in space. There is a general belief that it
is out there and that while it is a difficult pursuit, this is so
important that it is worth the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all astronomers agree. Ben Zuckerman, a professor of
astronomy at the University of California at Los Angeles, is among
those who believe that the possibility of finding intelligent
extraterrestrial life is so remote that SETI scientists are
probably spinning their wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've pretty much reached the conclusion that the occurrence of
technological life is an extremely rare occurrence,'' said
Zuckerman, who has debated the issue with SETI scientists at
professional conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckerman was also an outspoken critic of NASA's decision to
finance the SETI Institute, support that Congress withdrew within a
year. ``If researchers in places like the SETI Institute can raise
money from Silicon Valley or other private donors,'' he said,
``then I say more power to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson Alberts, a retired neurophysiologist, and his wife,
Marilyn, a retired high school English teacher, decided to endow
the Berkeley chair after becoming involved in SETI as volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important to us that it be an academic chair,'' Mrs.
Alberts said. ``The University of California doesn't provide chairs
to little green men from Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   The bane of SETI researchers is the cult of UFO conspiracy
theorists who subscribe to the belief that a spaceship crashed in
Roswell, N.M., or that Area 51 holds alien corpses. (The SETI
Institute's Web site, www.seti.org, is one character away from the
Web site for UFO believers, cseti.org, for example.) On the
contrary, the prevailing belief of SETI devotees is that given the
technology and the size of the universe, finding signs of
intelligent extraterrestrial life may take 50 or even 100 years or
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone who thinks the discovery of extraterrestrial
life will happen in our lifetimes is a rosy-eyed optimist,''
Alberts said. ``The important thing is to just know that it's going
to go on. The idea that we're not going to live to see it is not
one that's holding us up in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   The chair, endowed in February, will provide support for a
faculty member in the astronomy department to conduct research.
Should intelligent life be discovered, the chair could be opened to
researchers in other departments, like linguistics.
</P>
<P>
   Most SETI research entails analyzing weak radio signals from
space, in a hunt for some manifestation of any alien civilization's
technology. (Other SETI projects, including two at Berkeley, are
looking for light pulses or narrow-frequency beams of light, on the
premise that distant civilizations may use light waves as a means
of signaling their existence to the rest of the universe.)
</P>
<P>
   Welch, who is an expert on star formation and is married to Jill
Tarter, a director of the SETI Institute who was the model for the
astronomer Jodie Foster played in the 1997 film ``Contact,'' is
using his SETI chair to help design and build what could become the
world's largest array of radiotelescopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank Drake came up with the idea,'' he said. ``What we've
decided to do is team up with the SETI Institute and build an array
of five hundred to a thousand commercially available satellite
dishes, like your backyard dish, and connect them so that they
become a very large and sensitive radio ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Many SETI observations depend on the famous 1,000-foot-diameter
radiotelescope at Arecibo, P.R. But Welch said competition for that
telescope, the world's largest, allowed SETI only 20 days a year of
observation time.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we set up and get the bugs out,'' he said, ``the
actual viewing time is cut substantially.''
</P>
<P>
   The new array (which will be built at either the Hat Creek
Observatory or one of four other locations in California where
radio interference is at a minimum) will allow SETI observations to
be performed 24 hours a day while other astronomical science is
conducted simultaneously, Welch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what makes it so exciting,'' he said. ``SETI
observations will be immensely helped, and scientists all over the
world will be able to take advantage of it.''

 ROME: cutting costs.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the agreement were announced, it would pose what appears to
be an insurmountable obstacle to a $65 billion hostile bid for
Telecom Italia by Olivetti SpA, the No. 2 Italian phone company.
</P>
<P>
   It was Olivetti's bid for Telecom Italia last month that forced
the bigger company's chief executive, Franco Bernabe, into an
urgent search for a savior and discussions with his Deutsche
Telekom counterpart, Ron Summer.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Colaninno, Olivetti's chief executive, was the most
prominent skeptic about the proposed German-Italian deal on Monday,
suggesting that the postponement of the news conference in London
signaled broader problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to cancel the press conference?'' he said to
reporters. `'Why? Aren't the planes flying?''
</P>
<P>
   But advisers to the companies said they were confident the
boards would reach agreement. `'They will pull it off,'' an adviser
to Deutsche Telekom said.
</P>
<P>
   A merger of the two companies would create the world's largest
phone company ranked by stock market value, at about $212 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Its revenue, of about $63 billion, would be surpassed only by
that of the Japanese phone giant, NTT.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dramatic move,'' said Christopher Tucker, director of
telecommunications research at the West LB Panmure brokerage in
London. `'It's a wakeup call to the sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Although details of the merger remained unclear on Monday night,
the chief executives of both companies were expected to share
responsibilities for a period of time.
</P>
<P>
   According to advisers to the companies, the deal could involve
the creation of a new company in which Deutsche Telekom
shareholders would own the majority stake. They said the new
company would pay as much as 12 euros, or about $12.72, for each
Telecom Italia share. Based on Telecom Italia's 7.43 billion shares
outstanding, the total value of the deal would be about $95.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Though the companies appeared at pains on Monday night to
describe the deal as a merger of equals, it was clear that Deutsche
Telekom would likely emerge the stronger partner.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in the shares of Telecom Italia on the Milan exchange
and in the company's American depository receipts on Wall Street
were suspended on Monday. The Milan authorities said they would
decide before the start of trading Tuesday whether to continue the
suspension. In Frankfurt, the share price of Deutsche Telekom
closed down 0.7 percent, at 37.90 euros.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the listless performance of Deutsche Telekom
reflected some investor skepticism at the deal. Given earlier
assurances by the government of Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema that
Telecom Italia should not be sold to foreign buyers, analysts said
it would be difficult to frame conditions that would make it appear
the deal was a full merger of equals. Moreover, given the powerful
market positions of both companies in their domestic markets, the
deal can be expected to come under close scrutiny by European
antitrust authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Karel Van Miert, the chief European antitrust official, said on
Monday that any such deal could not go ahead ``without substantial
concessions'' from both companies. Speaking to reporters in Geneva,
Switzerland, Van Miert said the proposed deal ``will be a
complicated case,'' but that `'one cannot be against a large merger
in principle,'' particularly given the trend to large combinations
in the global industry.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Olivetti advisers were quick to criticize the proposed deal.
``These are two not too efficient giants getting together, and they
think they are creating a Ferrari,'' said an investment banker
advising Olivetti.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while officials close to both companies sought to
project an air of certainty, differences appear to have arisen
among the members of the Telecom Italia board over the planned 40
percent control that would be left to Telecom Italia shareholders,
which would require substantial legal maneuvering to assure that a
merger of equals would in fact emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the German government, which now holds a 72 percent
share in Deutsche Telekom, would wind up with a diluted 40 percent
share after the proposed merger. But this too remains a problem for
Italian leaders. Telecom Italia, the formerly national phone
company, was taken public by the government in recent years, and
the Rome government now holds a residual 3.4 percent share, which
gives it veto rights over major decisions.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema, the Italian prime minister, reiterated Italy's interest
that the proposed company be controlled equally by German and
Italian interest. `'The agreement has to be of equals,'' he told a
weekly briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, German government ownership could be an
obstacle. `'We cannot allow ourselves to think that, having now
privatized Telecom Italia, it could become a company in which the
prime owner is the German state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A working group of cabinet and Treasury ministry officials is
expected to meet on Wednesday to set criteria under which the Rome
government may exercise its veto right, D'Alema's office said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of the deal came also from France Telecom, which
appeared to be one of the big losers in the arrangement. France
Telecom is linked with Deutsche Telekom in two major alliances, and
the companies have reciprocal 2 percent shareholdings.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom, in a statement, said it was `'premature to
measure all the consequences for the French-German partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   But the share price of France Telecom was hit hard on the Paris
bourse, falling 5.4 percent to close at 76.50 euros.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the merger was substantially worked out in recent
weeks in discussions between Telecom Italia's Bernabe and Deutsche
Telekom's Sommer. Deutsche Telekom hired Goldman Sachs to advise it
on the shape such a merger could take; Bernabe has been using
Credit Suisse First Boston and J.P. Morgan as advisers.

SERB REINFORCING TROOPS IN KOSOVO IN NEW OFFENSIVE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: 2nd take to move within 20 minutes.) 
 (nk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite four weeks of NATO air and missile strikes,
Yugoslavia's Army and police forces have sent thousands of
reinforcements into Kosovo and stepped up the use of helicopters
and aircraft to press their campaign against the province's
Albanians, NATO and Pentagon officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The reports of reinforcements _ and heavy fighting in several
parts of Kosovo _ appeared to undercut NATO's assertions that it is
choking off the ability of Yugoslavia to resupply its forces in the
field. The officials said they based their reports on intelligence
information.
</P>
<P>
   The inability to stop the Yugoslav offensive, after more than
6,000 allied sorties, has forced NATO to consider ways to expand
the scope and intensity of its attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In a development that could open up a new avenue for the
alliance's airplanes to attack Serbia from the east, Bulgaria
agreed on Monday to allow NATO to freely cross its airspace.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and NATO have asked several Balkan states to
consider allowing overflight or providing bases to accommodate more
than 300 additional aircraft that the alliance's supreme commander,
Gen. Wesley K. Clark, has requested for the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, President Clinton spoke to Bulgarian President
Petar Stoyanov, along with leaders of Romania, Albania and Hungary,
and discussed contributions their countries could make, a senior
administration official said. The official declined to elaborate on
options discussed by the nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get a number of things lined up,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials are also considering basing aircraft in Hungary,
one of the alliance's three new members, and could consider putting
additional aircraft in Turkey to use the Bulgarian airspace.
Another option being considered is using the aircraft carrier
Enterprise to broaden the air attack, which would mean devoting two
of the nation's 12 aircraft carriers to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   A day after reporting one of the most intense nights of bombing
since the air assault began on March 24, NATO officials said on
Monday that rain overnight forced the cancellation of a majority of
raids. Even so, they reported strikes against oil complexes at Novi
Sad and Smederevo and ammunition storage or manufacturing sites in
Paracin, Pristina and Bujanovac.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks continued for a 27th day on Monday, although with
less intensity.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO's headquarters in Brussels, officials continued to point
to the successes of the strikes, including the disruption of
Yugoslavia's oil supply, but so far the attacks have done little to
cripple the campaign. NATO spokesman Jamie Shea disclosed that
``about 8,000 extra Yugoslav forces'' had been sent to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Washington, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon put the
increase at about 3,000, saying the total number of Yugoslav Army
troops and paramilitary police in the province could be as high as
43,000. Officials later said the increase _ which was based on
intelligence reports and satellite photographs _ had occurred
gradually as the Yugoslav Army and police shored up units carrying
out a sweep of villages in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said the reinforcements underscored Yugoslavia's
difficulties in quashing rebels from the Kosovo Liberation Army,
whose fight for independence for the province prompted the Yugoslav
crackdown that has led to NATO's bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a sign of how difficult Belgrade is finding it to
bring the area under total control,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the buildup showed that the Serbs who dominate
Yugoslavia's military are still able to fight, despite an
intensification of NATO's bombing to include more daylight strikes
against ground forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Giuseppe Marani of Italy,
reported an increase in attacks by Yugoslav planes and helicopters,
including many on Sunday. NATO aircraft, which commanders have said
are able to strike at will over Yugoslavia, were not close enough
to them to attack, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marani dismissed the significance of Yugoslavia's Air Force,
which has been repeatedly targeted by NATO warplanes and missiles.
``If they succeed in taking off, their mission has to be short, has
to be of limited size and with limited scope,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days there have been new reports of clashes, not just
along Kosovo's border with Albania, where the rebels are strongest,
but also in other parts of the province, including Mitroveic,
Podujevo and Malisevo. ``In fact, we have reports of large
movements of Serb forces across Kosovo as these operations
continue,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said that the Serbs were driving about 150,000 of Kosovo's
Albanians from the north toward the provincial capital, Pristina,
in what he called ``a kind of anti-humanitarian corridor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This suggests that this is not simply random ethnic cleansing,
but it's being done on an almost scientific and systematic basis,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, NATO and Pentagon officials remain puzzled by the
Yugoslav strategy. On Sunday, the officials said Monday, some
40,000 refugees crossed into Macedonia and Albania. By Monday,
however, only a trickle did as Yugoslav authorities again
reportedly closed its borders.

WHITE HOUSE TANGLES WITH CHINA NOW, WITH CONGRESS LATER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Del., Mo.)   (af)  
 By ALISON MITCHELL and JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's negotiators leave for Beijing
on Tuesday to try to clinch a sweeping market-opening deal with
China. But some of the most intensive talks are going to take place
with a skeptical Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Any agreement that the administration reaches with China on its
entering the World Trade Organization is expected to face strong
opposition from a bipartisan coalition of Democrats who are
concerned about human rights and protection for American
manufacturers and Republicans who are interested in punishing China
for allegations of espionage and theft of United States weapons
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The political situation on Capitol Hill remains so tenuous that
Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader, said Monday that he would
advise the administration not to bring the issue to Congress until
more Republicans, including Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader,
could be turned around.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has called membership for China in the trade group ``the
wrong decision at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Chinese membership so controversial in Congress is
that it would deprive lawmakers of the opportunity they now have
every year to voice concerns about Beijing's behavior on an array
of issues.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Congress gets to vote annually on whether China should be
accorded normal trading status with the United States. If China
enters the WTO, its trade relations with the United States will be
made normal permanently.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fear that Congress would never approve an agreement
in the current climate that led President Clinton 10 days ago to
reject a proposed agreement with Zhu Rongji, the Chinese prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton abruptly reversed course last week after Zhu and
American business leaders loudly complained, leading to the renewal
of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they now believe that a final deal
with China can be negotiated by the end of May, presenting the
White House with a difficult decision.
</P>
<P>
   It could try to turn the annual debate in Congress over trade
relations with China into a make or break vote on ratification of
the deal. Or it could allow Congress to spill its anger at China in
the annual trade vote and then come back later in the fall and try
to win China entry to the world trade body.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official said opinion within the
administration was split, with Charlene Barshefsky, the United
States trade representative, advocating a full-blown debate soon
but others including Samuel R. Berger, the national security
adviser, believing that it would be politically costly and perhaps
fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., the finance committee chairman, who
is an administration ally on China, said Monday that he would lean
toward only one vote. ``My inclination is once is enough,'' Roth
said. ``It's going to take bipartisan support. I think we'll get it
through the Senate, but its not going to be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The House is even less certain, with many Republicans hewing
toward a more isolationist course and many Democrats less enamored
with free trade and more concerned about human rights issues while
looking for ways to protect American manufacturing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   John P. Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, said
simply that House approval of an agreement right now ``would be a
challenge,'' though Hastert himself supported Chinese membership in
the WTO as long as it obeyed the institution's rules.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., the House minority leader, said
he was trying to ``think creatively'' about ways that Congress
might yet be able to have an annual review of China's behavior. He
declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am for China being in the WTO,'' Gephardt said. ``I think
the more you get China involved in living with international rules
on trade and having a rule of law in the country, the better it is
for everybody. Having said that, it is also important to maintain a
way to keep pressure on China to give their people basic human
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, administration officials said, they will delay a
decision on how to proceed until they have a deal in hand and until
they can judge how successful the business community will be in
lobbying Congress not to imperil the huge market openings that
China has offered in areas ranging from agriculture to
telecommunications, banking and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty corporate executives from the Business Roundtable are to
meet at the White House on Tuesday with John Podesta, the White
House chief of staff, and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin before
lobbying lawmakers including Lott.
</P>
<P>
   But another wild card is labor. ``This is a new ball game,''
said David A. Smith, the AFL-CIO's public policy director, noting
that the United States already had a $60 billion trade deficit with
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless a range of human and labor rights questions are
resolved,'' he said, ``and at the moment that seems unlikely, it's
unlikely we would find any WTO accession agreement acceptable.''

A CAN'T-LOSE DECISION FOR TUCKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It seemed like the perfect fit: A local player
chooses to play baseball at the local university. For Brad Tucker,
though, it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   After three seasons at Fresno State, Tucker decided he needed to
go pitch for a team where he felt wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a time where I needed to make a decision for my
baseball career,'' Tucker said. ``What I felt was the best decision
for me was to get out of there. I felt I wasn't getting the best
out of myself. I needed a change of scenery.''
</P>
<P>
   The right-handed Tucker went from a pitcher without an identity
at Fresno State to a player who seemingly can't lose at Pepperdine.
His record with the Waves over the past 1{ seasons is 15-1,
including 7-0 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker has helped the Waves to a 32-7 record and a ranking as
high as third in the nation. Even after two mediocre outings this
past weekend at Loyola Marymount _ Saturday he lasted just 11/3
innings and gave up five earned runs _ Tucker leads the Waves
starters with a 2.73 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   In three outings before the LMU series, he was 2-0 with a 0.76
ERA. The Pepperdine staff entered last week fifth in the nation
with a 3.25 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy for Brad,'' Pepperdine coach Frank Sanchez
said. ``Brad has been able to establish himself here.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't at Fresno State, even after coming in as a heralded
freshman from Bullard High, a local baseball powerhouse. He
appeared in 28 games as a Bulldog, 19 starts, and had a combined
record of 7-5. He was 4-2 as a freshman, redshirted his sophomore
year after suffering a lower back injury, then went 3-3 with a 4.42
ERA in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The local media labeled Tucker a disappointment, especially
after the success his older brother Ben had as a pitcher at USC.
Still, he said it was tough to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of people that followed me up there and who were
supportive,'' he said. ``But I kind of got myself into a rut.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan rallying: Outfielder Matt Riordan developed into a solid
college player _ and pro prospect _ in his first two seasons at
Loyola Marymount.
</P>
<P>
   This year has been more of a struggle for Riordan, who was the
Daily News' Player of the Year in 1995 at Westlake High. After
getting the game-winning single in the Lions' 6-5 win over
Pepperdine on Sunday, Riordan's season batting average stood at
.315. His career average at LMU was .352 entering the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been unlucky in a lot of things,'' Riordan said. ``Bad
calls by umpires, line drives hit right at people.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he hit safely in a team-high 14 games earlier this
season and is 16 for 19 in stolen-base attempts, Riordan said he
thinks he's pressed at the plate. He will be eligible for the
major-league draft in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play pro ball,'' he said. ``We'll see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelic touch: It's no surprise LMU's three-game sweep of
Pepperdine coincided with the return of junior second baseman
Anthony Angel to the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Angel sprained his ankle in the first game of a doubleheader
against San Francisco three weeks ago. He missed the Lions'
nonconference game at USC and two games at Portland. LMU was 1-3 in
that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough to sit on the bench,'' said Angel, who is LMU
head coach Frank Cruz's nephew. ``It was definitely tough. (But) I
saw a lot of things I can work on.''
</P>
<P>
   Angel used his new-found knowledge to bat .533 (8 for 15) in the
three games against the Waves. He had seven RBI in the series and
hit his third homer of the season in Saturday's 19-10 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Angel) is such a magnet,'' Cruz said. ``He's a leader. It's
good to have him back, no doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Tie at the top: USC, all but out of the postseason six weeks
ago, is tied for the Pacific-10 lead with Stanford after taking two
of three against the host Cardinal this past weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (26-18 overall, 12-3 in the Pac-10) beat Stanford
17-15 on Sunday despite a career-high five hits and seven RBI by
former Camarillo standout Joe Borchard, who leads the Cardinal with
a .399 average and eight home runs.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the Trojans were down 9-2. The best pitching
performance by USC came from Dominic Correa, normally a utility
infielder. He pitched the last three innings and didn't give up an
earned run to earn his first career win.
</P>
<P>
   Great Scott: Bill Scott, a sophomore outfielder at UCLA,
continued his impressive season with a three-run homer and four RBI
in the Bruins' 9-3 win Saturday over Arizona State. Scott leads
UCLA with 15 homers and 60 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA got a game-winning grand slam in the bottom of the ninth
from second baseman Chase Utley to beat the 14th-ranked Sun Devils
8-6 Sunday and complete a three-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who had never hit more than two homers in a game at
Alemany High, set Pac-10 records with four homers and 11 RBI
against Washington on March 30. He leads the Bruins (20-23) in nine
offensive categories. &QL;

 Stock Splits And Your Tax Bill
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Arthur M. Louis &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I am holding some common stock that I purchased in 1987
at $72 per share. The original holding was 100 shares, but the
stock has split 2-for-1 three times since then, and now I have 800
shares, recently selling at $55 per share. If I sell only the
original 100 shares, can I use the $72-per-share cost basis in
figuring my capital gain?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Boy, don't you wish!
</P>
<P>
   If you could do that, you could reduce your tax bill by
declaring a capital loss to offset your capital gains or other
income. You would be selling $5,500 worth of stock while figuring
your cost basis at $7,200.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, you can't do that. Because the stock splits have
left you with eight times as many shares as you started, you must
divide your original cost per share by eight to determine your
present per-share cost basis.
</P>
<P>
   Eight divided into 72 equals 9, so your cost per current share
is $9. If you were to sell 100 shares at $55 per share, you would
have to report a $4,600 long-term capital gain ($5,500 minus $900).
The gain would be long term because you have held the shares for
more than one year.
</P>
<P>
   What you have in mind is not, as you suggest, selling your
``original 100 shares.'' Your original 100 shares have become 800
shares, so selling 100 now is the same as selling only 12-1/2 of
your original shares.
</P>
<P>
   Value of Old Stocks
</P>
<P>
   Q: From 1969 to 1975 I was employed with General Electric and
picked up some stock through my retirement fund. I have the
certificates in my possession, and want to know how I can contact
GE to determine their worth. I believe the stock has split over the
past 20 years and also has been accumulating dividends. Can you
give me some direction?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Something doesn't add up. If you have held the
certificates all those years, then GE should have sent you new
shares every time it split the stock. It also should have mailed
you dividends every three months.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that the bureaucracy fouled up your account somehow,
but I doubt it. The more likely explanation is that you changed
addresses without informing GE. If you did, the post office would
have bounced your split shares and dividends back to GE's transfer
agent.
</P>
<P>
   If that happened, then GE was legally required to turn your
property over to the government of the state in which you lived
just before the company lost track of you. The states hold
unclaimed property indefinitely. If that's what happened, you will
have to file a detailed claim with the state, establishing your
identity and your rights to the property.
</P>
<P>
   But your first move should be to telephone GE headquarters and
ask if the company has any records indicating what became of your
stock and your dividends. The headquarters number is (203)
373-2211. Ask for either the investor relations department or _
since you are a former employee _ the human resources department.
</P>
<P>
   Dividend Reinvestment
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have about 30 shares of PG&AMP;E stock and am participating in
the company's dividend reinvestment program. PG&AMP;E reinvests the
full amount of my cash dividends in the company's stock, but at the
end of the year it sends me a 1099 form indicating the amount of
dividends it paid me. Do I have to report that amount as income or
can I wait until I sell the stock and report it as a capital gain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Internal Revenue Service spokesman Larry Wright says you have
to report the dividends as ordinary income for the year in which
they are paid, even though you didn't actually lay hands on the
cash.
</P>
<P>
   When you sell the shares, the amount you paid through the
dividend-reinvestment program will constitute your cost basis in
calculating your capital gain.
</P>
<P>
   With most dividend-reinvestment programs, you get a detailed
year-end statement indicating how many shares you bought, when you
bought them and how much you paid. Save those statements, because
you will need them when you figure the tax on the shares you sell.
</P>
<P>
   The nice thing about these statements is that they enable you to
single out particular shares for sale _ assuming that you don't
sell them all at once. If you want to sell part of your holdings,
you should tell PG&AMP;E exactly which ones. You will want to sell

 Firm Hopes `Dot Com' Helps IPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Unwired Planet, the Redwood City company whose technology lets cell
phones access the Internet, is jumping in on the ``dot com'' trend.
</P>
<P>
   Just three weeks after filing to become a public company,
Unwired Planet plans to announce today that it will change its name
to Phone.com.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also adding a telecommunications heavy hitter to
its board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Reed Hundt, the former chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, will join Unwired's board effective today.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the company's impending initial public offering,
officials are in a ``quiet period'' and could not comment on the
name change or Hundt's appointment.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which was founded in 1994, provides technology that
enables the delivery of Internet-based services to wireless
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Using Unwired's Web-browsing technology, wireless carriers can
give customers the ability to get news alerts, check stock quotes
or find directions from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The information is displayed on a screen on the cell phone
instead of a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   Unwired, which plans to go public in the next few months, will
also change its Web site address today to &LR;  www.phone.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers familiar with Unwired said the company may
benefit from the dot com trend, in which dozens of Internet
companies have made millions _ at least on paper _ after going
public.
</P>
<P>
   However, several questioned whether the name Phone.Com is
actually a misnomer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they are trying to cash in on the cachet of the
Internet, but the name Unwired Planet spoke much more toward what
they did,'' said Albert Lin, who follows the wireless industry for
the Abernathy Group in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people will always associate them with phones.''
</P>
<P>
   Lin said the company's technology is universal enough that it
could be used in other devices, such as electronic organizers and
personal digital assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Hundt, who will join Unwired today, serves on the boards of
several Bay Area companies, including Alameda's Ascend
Communications and San Francisco's NorthPoint Communications.

 &HT;    Protesters arrested at Governor's Mansion
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A prudent measure intended to protect public
safety? Or an unconstitutional muzzling of free speech to suppress
criticism of Gov. George W. Bush's policy on air pollution?
</P>
<P>
   Those were the explanations offered by authorities and activists
after four protesters were arrested outside the Governor's Mansion
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a safety issue,'' said Tela Mange, a spokeswoman for
the Texas Department of Public Safety. ``If there are protesters on
the sidewalk, other people have to walk into the street to get
around them. They were asked at least twice to move out of the way,
and they refused and were arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters were handcuffed and taken to the Travis Central
Booking Facility on a charge of obstructing a passageway, a Class B
misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a
$2,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of several environmental and consumer groups
participating in the protest said it appears that Bush, who is
considering a run for the White House, wants to stifle critics. The
groups _ including Public Citizen, Texans United, the Texas
Campaign for the Environment and the Sustainable Energy and
Economic Development Coalition, among others _ oppose a Bush-backed
bill that would encourage, but not require, older industrial plants
to reduce emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Jacobson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties
Union, which is representing the arrested protesters, said he stood
on the sidewalk in front of the mansion for 35 to 40 minutes,
without holding a protest sign, and was not told to move. Only
people with signs were arrested, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motive is so clearly to stop their speech,'' Jacobson
said. ``It is certainly sad that in Texas, in front of the
Governor's Mansion, you cannot exercise your free-speech rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Those arrested were identified as Richard C. Abraham, 49, of
Houston; Roger C. Baker Jr., 56, of Austin; Michael R. Covington,
51, of Houston; and Karen N. Sloan, 47, of Webster, a Houston
suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The activists knew they were risking arrest and even sent out a
news release in advance announcing the possibility. Abraham was
arrested outside the mansion last month at a protest.
</P>
<P>
   DPS officers had instructed the activists to confine their
protest to an area just across Colorado Street, which borders the
mansion. But the activists marched from that side of Colorado to
the mansion side and began walking along a sidewalk at the edge of
the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, protests took place on the sidewalk without
incident, the activists said. Tom Vinger, a DPS spokesman, said a
new policy was initiated by Lt. Mike Escalante, head of the
governor's protective detail. Escalante consulted with DPS lawyers
on March 12 and notified the governor's office of the new rules,
Vinger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was concerned about safety and decided to establish a
designated protest area,'' Vinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush defended the policy and the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the rules are fair,'' he said. ``Everybody is given
the opportunity to come and express their pleasure or displeasure
with the governor. Everybody was given ample warning as to what
would happen if the rules were broken. As I understand it there
were several warnings given, and the person evidently wanted to
challenge the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   A bill supported by Bush and working its way through the
Legislature would allow older industrial plants to obtain air
pollution permits by complying with 10-year-old emission standards.
Participation in the program would be voluntary. Critics want the
Legislature to mandate compliance with current standards, which
would produce more cleanup but at higher costs.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Secret Service was preparing Monday for
President Clinton's planned visit to Austin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to land at the new Austin-Bergstrom
International Airport at 10:45 a.m. He will make a short speech to
invited guests, tour the airport passenger terminal, then go have
lunch with members of the Democratic National Committee at the West
Austin home of Roy Spence, an old friend and political backer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will be in Austin about six hours, said Dave Wilkinson,
the special agent in charge of the Austin office of the Secret
Service. The Secret Service is working with the Austin Police
Department, the Travis County Sheriff's Office and the state
Department of Public Safety on security matters.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Mayor Kirk Watson, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and other
dignitaries, including the family of the late Congresswoman Barbara
Jordan, for whom the airport's passenger terminal is named, are
expected to greet Clinton at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Construction at the airport is expected to be halted during the
president's arrival and departure at 4:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to fly on to Houston Wednesday for a supper
hosted by the Democratic National Committee.

CLINTON CALLS YELTSIN TO SEEK RESOLUTION IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton called President Boris Yeltsin of
Russia on Monday to press his country's involvement in a political
resolution in Kosovo that would involve Russian troops in an
international security force in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation, the first between the two leaders since the
NATO air assaults began on March 24, had a sense of urgency,
reflecting a perception that the longer the bombing dragged on the
more difficult a political outcome with the Russians would become,
according to an official who listened to the 45-minute
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The call was placed five days before the NATO begins a 50th
anniversary summit in Washington, a meeting that the administration
would like the Russians to attend as guests. But the Russians,
without formally rejecting the invitation, have indicated they are
unlikely to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal effort to engage Yeltsin followed a number of
feelers that have been put out in recent weeks by the
administration to Moscow, despite the strong anti-NATO sentiments
and protests that have swept through Russia since the bombing
began.
</P>
<P>
   From the very outset, the allied campaign looked to put
Washington-Moscow relations into a deep freeze. Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, en route to Washington when the decision
to bomb was taken, turned his plane around in mid-air and returned
home when he learned of it. Since then, Russian officials,
including Yeltsin, have issued frequent and bitter denunciations of
the campaign, ranging to hints that the Kremlin would restore cold
war targeting of its missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic continuing to
drive hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanians from their homes
and from the province despite the rain of bombs, administration
officials have been searching for steps toward a diplomatic
resolution in Kosovo. And almost from the beginning, they have
realized that any solution requires Russian cooperation, because of
the nation's special relationship with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton explained to Yeltsin on Monday that NATO and Russia have
mutual interests in Kosovo, according to the White House official.
</P>
<P>
   For the ethnic Albanians, NATO forces are essential to insure
their security in Kosovo. For the Serbian minority, a Russian
presence would insure their rights, and together the joint
overseers would allow for the autonomy of Kosovo within the
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, the White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's reply was neither a firm yes or no, but his answers
``put us on a more constructive tone than in the past,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Russians have insisted that a NATO-led force in
Kosovo is untenable, in large part because Milosevic has condemned
an outside force as a breach of Yugoslav sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has softened its language on the proposed
force, saying that it would have only a ``NATO-core'' and that a
Russian contingent could be under a separate command, much like the
Russian forces operate in the NATO-led force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   An international security force designed to secure Kosovo after
the bombing has forced all Serbian troops out, is the main element
of five principles set down by NATO for the resolution of the
conflict. The force, under NATO command and control, would insure
the return of the more than 500,000 ethnic Albanian refugees who
have been forced out of Kosovo by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   One underlying reason for pushing the Russians now,
administration officials said, was the possibility that a
protracted air campaign was likely to dim the possibilities of a
political solution. In part, NATO and the administration fear a
growing likelihood of civilian casualties, a prospect that would
make it very difficult for Moscow to be part of settlement
involving NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Monday that Yeltsin had
pledged not to send additional ships into the region. Last week,
the Russians sent a surveillance ship to cruise just south of the
Adriatic Sea. In addition, Yeltsin also told Clinton that Russia
would not be drawn into the conflict, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin agreed that the Russian and American teams set up to
deal with Kosovo _ former Prime Minister Viktor Chernymordin and
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov along with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
should work on the issue of sending forces to the region.
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared to be a reversion to form after the phone
conversation ended, Yeltsin put out a statement in Moscow saying
that as a precondition for finding a political solution, NATO
should immediately end the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House said that Yeltsin warned Clinton that he
would be issuing the statement. The president tried to dissuade
him, a White House official said, by saying that Milosevic had too
often let down Russia and the United States by breaking promises.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have said in recent days that they
understand how difficult it is for Yeltsin _ under pressure at home
from hard-liners _ to play a more constructive role in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Russian public opinion is strongly against the NATO air
assaults, and among the political class the bombing has underscored
Russia's slide from superpower status since the end of the cold
war.
</P>
<P>
   Russian nationalist and communist politicians have expressed
strong support for the Serb cause, and television images of damage
from NATO bombs _ supplied by the Serbians _ has further inflamed
feelings of Slavic brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Through all of this, Yeltsin has sought to soothe these
nationalist emotions, and administration officials here said the
phone call to Yeltsin on Monday was intended to play to his
pro-European, pro-democratic sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Moscow is engaged in trying to seal a new loan
agreement with the International Monetary Fund, and a delegation of
Russian finance officials is expected in Washington next week to
continue negotiations on the monetary package.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they had few illusions about
Russian leverage with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fraternal feelings between Belgrade and Moscow,
Russian diplomats had expressed frustration with Milosevic even
before the NATO air campaign began and viewed him more of a burden
than an asset.
</P>
<P>
   Although support for Serbia was strong among xenophobic Russian
politicians, administration officials have said in recent days that
Yeltsin understands the need for stability in the Balkans, which
includes the return of the ethnic Albanian refugees to a Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   By urging the Russians to sanction an international security
force and become part of it, the administration was holding out the
possibility of Kosovo remaining a part of Yugoslavia,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The push for Russian involvement in a diplomatic solution is
backed by the major NATO allies, particularly France and Germany.
The French interest in Russian participation, however, has a
slightly different focus.
</P>
<P>
   By winning Russian approval of an international security force
in Kosovo, a mandate from the U.N. Security Council for the force
would be much more likely, the French contend. The French view the
Security Council's approval of such a force as almost a
prerequisite, though American officials have said they are less
adamant on this point.

HOLBROOKE'S U.N. NOMINATION IS REPORTED CLOSE TO A DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate leaders and the State Department said Monday
that they were close to a deal that could rescue the long-delayed
nomination of Richard C. Holbrooke to lead the American delegation
to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would also at least raise the possibility that the
United States would pay hundreds of millions of dollars in back
dues to the organization.
</P>
<P>
   But Holbrooke's chief Democratic backer in the Senate is warning
that the longtime diplomat's nomination, sidetracked for eight
months by a Justice Department investigation, could still be
derailed by partisan debates in the Senate over policy in Kosovo or
over Holbrooke's ethics.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmaker, Sen. Joseph R. Biden of Delaware, ranking Democrat
on the Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview that
Holbrooke's nomination was ``not a done deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can flat out say it,'' Biden said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that if Sen. Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican
who is chairman of the committee, and other Senate Republicans do
not agree to hold a confirmation hearing in several weeks, the
nomination could effectively be dead. ``If it's not done in the
near term,'' Biden said, ``it means they've made a judgment to kill
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, a diplomat turned investment banker who is the
architect of the Dayton peace agreement in 1995 that ended the war
in Bosnia, has been active in shaping the policies that led to the
NATO air strikes this spring against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   His Senate confirmation has faced two major hurdles since
President Clinton chose him for the post last June, the ethics
investigation, which ended in February when Holbrooke agreed to pay
$5,000 to settle civil charges that he had violated lobbying laws,
and a dispute between the administration and Helms over a measure
to repay the back dues to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Senate and administration officials said Helms had pledged to
block Holbrooke's nomination unless the State Department agreed to
support a bill he has proposed with Senator Biden to pay the dues.
Under the deal between the Foreign Relations Committee and the
State Department, the department would support the so-called
Helms-Biden bill, which would allow the repayment of more than $900
million in back dues.
</P>
<P>
   The administration agreed to support another provision, to
reduce the overall contribution to the United Nations budget and
require bureaucratic changes at the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department had initially balked at several elements of
the bill, including its requirement of a 20 percent cap, down from
25 percent today, on American contributions to the overall United
Nations budget.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright was determined to hammer out a compromise with Helms, if
only to rescue Holbrooke's nomination, which had been stalled since
it was submitted in February. Officials said a compromise could be
reached as early as this week.
</P>
<P>
   The senator has refused to schedule a confirmation hearing,
saying through a spokesman that the committee cannot hold the
hearing until the Justice and State Departments have turned over
documents gathered in the ethics inquiry. ``Getting documents from
State and Justice has been like pulling teeth,'' said the
spokesman, Marc A. Thiessen.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Holbrooke said he had no comment on the Senate
and State Department talks.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement between Helms and the administration over his
version of the legislation might free up the nomination. But it
would not guarantee final passage by Congress or a final decision
by President Clinton to sign the legislation and allow the United
States to pay the back dues. In previous years, House Republicans
have saddled similar bills with anti-abortion provisions, leading
to Presidential vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced in June that he would nominate Holbrooke as
the chief delegate to the United Nations, a post that carries
Cabinet rank, replacing Bill Richardson, who became energy
secretary. The nomination was quickly sidetracked as a result of
anonymous allegations that Holbrooke had violated federal ethics
laws after resigning from the State Department in 1996 to become an
investment banker.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry ended in February, when Holbrooke, without
acknowledging wrongdoing, agreed to pay $5,000 to settle civil
charges that he had violated the law when, within weeks of
resigning, he asked the American Embassy in Seoul for help in
meeting South Korean leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Biden said he had reviewed that case. ``Nothing I have seen at
all, in any way, impugns his integrity or is any reason why he
shouldn't be confirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that might not stop Republicans on the Foreign
Relations Committee from starting a full-scale review of ``these
bush-league ethics charges.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As we all know,'' Biden said, ``once you get into this ethical
quagmire, it almost doesn't matter if you're totally innocent. If
there's a desire on the part of anyone in the Republican
establishment or on the part of even a single Republican to stop
his nomination, this could be their starting point.''

 WASHINGTON: it borders. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clark and other commanders have been frustrated by NATO's
inability to reverse Yugoslavia's success in driving hundreds of
thousands of Albanians from the province.
</P>
<P>
   More than a week after Clark asked for 300 additional aircraft,
bringing the total NATO force to more than 1,000, the Pentagon has
still not formally signed off on the request. Officials said
approval was expected, but because the request will require Clinton
to authorize the activation of as many 33,000 reservists and guard
members, the process has moved sluggishly.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue has been finding bases for the aircraft. Italy's
facilities, which have been the fulcrum of the strikes, are already
overloaded. Officials said they expected to be able to announce the
deployment of the additional aircraft later in the week, once they
had worked through the sensitivities in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of two dozen Apache helicopters to Albania _ part
of the effort to strike at the Yugoslav forces directly involved in
the killings _ has also suffered new setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the Apaches, now in Italy, were supposed to arrive
in Albania's capital over the weekend, but were grounded by
weather.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon on Monday, a spokesman tried to explain the
latest delay by showing photographs of deep mud at the airfield
where the Apaches were supposed to land. For reasons that were not
clear, the American forces sent in advance of the helicopters made
their base in a low-lying field near the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the mud in sector has accumulated,'' said Maj. Gen. Charles
F. Wald, the deputy director of strategic plans and policy for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff. ``And this is part of the reason it is
taking a little time to get there: Mother Nature.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Apaches may now arrive on Tuesday, but are not
expected to be ready for combat until next week, more than a month
after Clark first requested them.
</P>
<P>
   Impatience over NATO's strategy continues to reverberate here.
Clinton sent a request to Congress on Monday for more than $6
billion in emergency funds, most of it to pay for the Pentagon's
aircraft, ships, missiles and bombs in the Kosovo conflict. The
request might well ignite a heated debate over the state of the
American military, its role in the Balkans, and the readiness of
its arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called on Congress to approve the money quickly, without
rancor. ``The need for this funding is urgent, immediate, clearly
in the national interest,'' he said. ``There are literally lives
hanging in the balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said that part of the
money would go toward helping Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia,
Romania and Macedonia. ``They need to have some assurance of being
able to withstand the extraordinary drubbing that they have taken,
not just over the past month during the current military campaign,
but over the last decade,'' Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers, accusing the Clinton administration of
letting American military muscle atrophy, said they planned to use
the request as a funnel to provide the Pentagon with additional
billions of dollars for programs unrelated to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense capabilities are now grossly inadequate,'' House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said. ``Our armaments and other
necessary combat supplies are too low and insufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said House Republicans would ``review the president's
emergency funding request in light of our broader military needs''
and try to create ``a bill which strengthens our defense structure
when and where warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said,
``It will be very, very difficult, if not impossible,'' to pass an
emergency bill for the air war if it becomes laden with things not
essential to the war in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The request includes $5.1 billion for the cost of fuel, bombs,
missiles and personnel. There was also $850 million for unforeseen
contingencies and $274 million to pay for the four-day attack on
Iraq in December and the continuing enforcement of the ``no
flight'' zones over that country.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the administration had disclosed the added
costs of the nation's other running conflict.

COMPAQ HAS ITS JOB CUT OUT FOR IT IN SEARCH FOR NEW CEO 
 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Finding a replacement for Compaq Computer Corp.'s
ousted Chief Executive Eckhard Pfeiffer won't be easy, industry
analysts said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The talent pool of qualified replacements is too small,
Hewlett-Packard Co. is already on the hunt for a new CEO to take
Lewis Platt's place, and board members will have to please both
themselves and shareholders _ a difficult chore in any search,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any CEO search is difficult because you have various
constituencies _ both at the board of directors level and with
shareholders _ that make it a challenge,'' said Jane Howze,
managing director of Houston-based executive search firm The
Alexander Group.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation on Monday as to where Compaq would go for its
candidates ran the gamut of the nation's top technology executives.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg News quoted industry analysts &UR;  &LR; as saying several
executives would be good choices. Among them: Rick Belluzzo,
chairman and CEO of SGI; Eric Schmidt, chairman and CEO of Novell;
Robert Pittman, president and chief operating officer of America
Online; and Sam Palmisano or John Thompson, senior vice presidents
of International Business Machines Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Until a successor is named, Compaq chairman and co-founder Ben
Rosen will run the company with vice chairmen Frank Doyle and
Robert Enloe until a new CEO is found.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq must also find a replacement for Earl Mason, its chief
financial officer, who resigned Saturday to become president and
chief executive of Alliant Foodservice, a fast-growing
Chicago-based food service distributor.
</P>
<P>
   He had been in discussions with the firm since January and
notified the Compaq board of his intentions to leave in March.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Treasurer Ben Wells will be acting CFO.
</P>
<P>
   Mason didn't want to discuss whether Compaq would have kept him
as CFO if he hadn't resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. You'd have to ask Compaq,'' he said. ``I left on
very good terms with all of them. Ben and I are very good
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Howze expects it will take several months for Compaq to find a
replacement for Mason and Pfeiffer, who joined the company in 1983.
The search is being led by the search firm Heidrick &AMP; Struggles.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates must have a breadth of capability and would probably
be a CEO or have CEO potential, Rosen said during a conference call
Monday morning with analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The candidate should have a minimum comfort level with
technology,'' Rosen said. ``It requires someone in general who can
manage an extremely complex multinational company.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Mazzucchelli, a senior vice president at Gerard Klauer
Mattison, was not excited about the idea of a board running the PC
maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has a rational perspective on this,'' he said. ``In
my view, the stock shouldn't do anything until we get a better
sense of where they're going.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dzialo, director of research at Olde Discount Corp. in
Detroit, said a three-member executive panel is acceptable for the
short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq needs to have a person at the helm who has a good
working rapport with the management team and with the board of
directors,'' Dzialo said. ``The company has a lot of potential, but
they need help with the execution.''
</P>
<P>
   The departures of Pfeiffer and Mason came nine days after the
company warned first-quarter profits would be less than half what
analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq fell 7/8 to 22 3/4 in trading of 38.6 million shares,
making it the second-most active U.S. stock. The stock rose as much
as 4.2 percent earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   That's a far cry from last week's 24 percent tumble. Compaq
shares have lost more than half their value since reaching a record
high of 49 1/4 on Jan. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has struggled for much of the past year to become more
competitive with companies like Dell Computer Corp., the No. 1
direct PC seller. At the same time, it is trying to meld with the
services and sophisticated computers gained from its $9 billion
purchase of Digital Equipment Corp.

</P>
<P>
   In a stunning about-face, investors piled out of technology
stocks and other market darlings, pummeling the very shares that
propelled the broad market averages to records last week. The
Nasdaq composite index, home to many of the nation's technology
companies, fell 138.43 points, or 5.57 percent, to 2,345.61. That
was its second-biggest point fall and seventh largest in percentage

<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ On the wall behind his desk, Ehud Barak, the
Labor Party candidate for prime minister, keeps an old photograph
of himself dressed in white mechanic's overalls, descending the
gangway of a Sabena Airlines jet.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, disguised as a member of the flight crew, Barak, a
highly decorated former general, had just commanded the successful
storming of the plane, which had been hijacked by Palestinian
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere outside the range of the picture stood Benjamin
Netanyahu, then one of the lieutenants in Barak's tiny elite force,
now prime minister and Barak's chief rival for the top job in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   That the episode figures prominently in both of their political
biographies underscores how very small the power elite is in this
country of 6 million people. Personal or intimate professional
connections between leaders often predate their political
antagonisms.
</P>
<P>
   In this case the relationship between Barak and Netanyahu _ that
of a former commander and his lieutenant _ and between their
families may be preventing an otherwise bruising campaign from
descending into a quagmire of mudslinging. The links may have
prescribed natural limits based on some degree of mutual respect
and shared history between the two candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Or the civility could arise from polls indicating that ad
hominem attacks delivered by the candidates do not work.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, a campaign that was expected to focus exclusively on
character _ and specifically on Netanyahu's perceived flaws as a
leader _ has more content than most Israeli political analysts give
it credit for. Ideologically, it turns on the very different
attitudes toward peacemaking of Netanyahu and Barak, the leading
contenders in a five-way race for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   On May 17, Israelis will cast two ballots _ one for Parliament
and the other for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The storming of the Sabena plane was a formative experience for
both men, one of several defining encounters with terrorism. But
they drew radically different conclusions from their experiences,
shaping their very dissimilar perceptions of Israel's strength and
stability in a volatile Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   While the public debate has been superficial, each candidate has
in recent interviews fully expressed an attitude toward peace that
grows from divergent visions of Israel at age 51. Netanyahu
described a country that must still be on guard against those who
want to destroy the Jewish homeland; Barak saw a country strong as
``a kind of a benign killer whale'' in a ``tough neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Personally each man, and especially Barak, spoke of the other
without the vehemence voiced by their campaigns. Although Netanyahu
described his opponents on the left as consumed by a ``great deal
of antipathy, if not hatred,'' for him, he did not ascribe
responsibility to Barak but rather to the Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   Barak sounded relatively gracious, if condescending, in
describing the prime minister _ even if he did conclude by
referring to Netanyahu with a withering metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bibi's not a bad man,'' Barak said, using Netanyahu's
nickname. ``He's not as kind of superficial as his political
opponents from Likud or our side try to make him. He's focused.
He's systematic. He's well intentioned. He's not trying to destroy
anything deliberately. He's trying to do the right things for
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   And then the metaphor: ``I think of him as a high-quality
mechanical watch with one small wheel turning the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, Netanyahu, a graduate student at MIT, and
Barak, a graduate student at Stanford University, flew back
together from the United States to fight in the 1973 war. Three
years later, in an episode devastating to both of them, Netanyahu's
older brother, Yonatan, a commando, was killed in the airborne raid
to free hostages in Entebbe, Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu and his brother were very close. Barak and Yonatan
Netanyahu, who once served as his military deputy, were dear
friends who lived in the same apartment complex. Barak's wife,
Nava, broke the news to Yonatan's girlfriend that he had been
killed. And on the anniversary of the Entebbe raid, Barak and
Netanyahu both faithfully visit Yonatan's grave on Mount Herzl.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu and Barak have been running neck and neck, with Barak
a couple of percentage points ahead recently. Another former
general inside the intimate circle of opponents, Yitzhak Mordechai,
the Center Party candidate, has been trailing them. He was a
defense minister under Netanyahu and a commander under Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all of these Center Party guys,'' Barak said, referring
to Mordechai and the three other leaders, ``I go back so far I knew
their wives before they did.''
</P>
<P>
   In private conversations the prime minister has spoken of Barak
with a kind of chilly admiration, referring to him as a man of
substance who, like himself, has complex, often prickly
relationships with associates.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview, Netanyahu neither sang Barak's praises nor
assailed him personally. He offered his public criticism: that
Barak, at heart a leftist, will ``fold'' before Palestinian
demands.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Barak hardly sounds like a leftist to outsiders. He calls the
West Bank by its biblical _ and military _ name, Judea and Samaria.
He talks not of integration with the Palestinians but of a
``physical separation'' from them. And he says it pains him to
think of conceding land to the Palestinians or the Syrians, which
would be decisions made with his head, not his heart.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Netanyahu, he does not see Israel as in danger, and
that makes a world of political difference.
</P>
<P>
   To Netanyahu, Israel may be close to becoming an economic
``miracle'' but remains vulnerable. Too many concessions in the
name of making peace could create what he says the Palestinians
want: ``a reduced Israel that is largely indefensible, huddled on a
fragile coastline with a Palestinian state on the mountains above
holding an Iraqi or Iranian umbrella.''
</P>
<P>
   To Barak, Israel has emerged as ``the strongest country in a
thousand miles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get rid of this ghetto anxiety,'' he said, ``that
we are still surrounded by demons. We are surrounded by rivals that
are taking care of their business and we are taking care of ours.
We are stronger already, but we would be stronger still if we were
united and we did not control the Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu scorns the idea that a Western-style peace can be
forged between Israel and its neighbors _ a peace built on ``good
will and concessions.'' Concessions to dictators or undemocratic
governments are seen as ```signs of weakness and stimuli for
additional aggression against you,'' he said. He wants Israel's
security to come first, and mocks the many ``grand ceremonies on
manicured lawns'' that have accompanied treaty signings.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has long advocated ``peace with security.'' He insists
that the Palestinians clamp down more systematically not only on
terrorism but also on anti-Israeli propaganda before Israel turns
over any more land in the West Bank. He says that peace should be
made slowly so that it can last.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other way, it's faster, but you wake up not with a
hangover but with a potential catastrophe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, however, believes that the prime minister is holding the
bar too high. He jokes that Netanyahu wants all of Israel's Arab
neighbors to convert to ``Jeffersonian democracies'' before he will
consider making peace with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netanyahu argues that if there isn't a heavenly kind of
utopian security, we should not negotiate,'' Barak said. ``I say
the opposite. Start with peace, then you achieve security. We
should be open-eyed about our neighbors. They are not reading
Jefferson before going to sleep. Still, we have to move forward.''

SIDELINED ROENICK SEES A DIFFERENT COYOTE TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - He is sitting near his pool, hand
immobilized by a cast, eyes floating from a breakfast of
painkillers, face inflated from surgery, his jigsaw jaw fused in
three places.
</P>
<P>
   If you're wondering how Jeremy Roenick is doing, well, you try
waking up every morning with a mouthful of screaming teeth. Other
than that, he feels great.
</P>
<P>
   Not about himself. About a hockey team that must cross the
bridge without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to beat St. Louis, no question,'' Roenick
said. ``And I'm looking forward to watching it.''
</P>
<P>
   Intuition? Or wishful thinking?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just see a different look in their faces,'' he said. ``A
different mood. Keith (Tkachuk) is really prepared. I think he
wants to bring this team to a new level, and he's just the guy who
can do it. I have all the confidence in the world that they're
going to have a great playoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Words. You could freeze Roenick's vocal chords and they'd still
find a way out, full of swagger, destined for somebody's bulletin
board.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the door opens to another postseason. For the
Coyotes, the playoffs are like the kind of relative who stays a few
days, leaves the place a mess and takes off for someone else's
house. They are trying to break a long-standing jinx, trying to win
a series with long-term ramifications. And they must do so without
their leading scorer, their top-line center, their prime-time
player.
</P>
<P>
   You are tempted to smirk at Roenick's confidence, eager to
recall his gold-medal guarantee at the 1998 Olympic Games in
Nagano. That prediction went up in flames, and when someone reached
for the fire extinguisher, it was too late. Someone else had
already thrown it out of the dormitory window. &QL; 
Fed up with losing &QL; 
But this might be a little different. What Roenick senses could be
the natural evolution of a team weaned on first-round exits. A team
so sick of losing that it's not going to happen again, regardless
of injuries, excuses and opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``As athletes, a lot of times we learn the hard way,'' Roenick
said. ``But there's a whole different feeling about this team.
Shoney (head coach Jim Schoenfeld) has done a great job at staying
in tune with the pulse of the team. Keith has matured tremendously
as a leader. He knows that everyone in that dressing room wants the
same thing _ to win a Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   And for those who still cling to notions of a feud between the
two stars, Tkachuk was one of the first to call Roenick when he
returned from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an arrogant (mild expletive). So am I, and so are a lot
of hockey players,'' Roenick said. ``But he does care. A lot of
people say he just cares about himself. But Keith cares a lot about
this hockey team, and he does want to win. And I'm telling you,
he's got that look in his eye. The look where you know he wants to
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Proof: When Tkachuk was asked about overcoming Roenick's injury,
he barked out the following response: ``No excuses. This is where
it starts. I don't care if you have 10 guys out of the lineup, you
have to find a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a shame this kind of determination is saddled by injury,
especially when the another first-round flop could mean significant
changes in the organization. If the Coyotes fall to the Blues, the
head coach is gone. Roenick and a few others could be traded. The
chemistry might be altered. And pending the outcome of the Los
Arcos project, payroll might be slashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot depends on that new building,'' Roenick said. &QL; 
`A job to do' &QL; 
For now, all of that is out of Roenick's control. He can't play
hockey without risk of shattering his face. He can't chew for five
weeks. Because of his injured hand, he can't even use the
world-class putting green over in the corner of his yard. But one
thing is certain: Although his wife is concerned over his battered
body, Roenick will not retire any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wants me to be healthy, wants me to be able to play with
my kids,'' he said. ``But she would never ask me to retire from the
game. She knows I want to win a Stanley Cup. She knows that's my
dream, to carry that Cup. She would never take that away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   But the chase only gets tougher. In 1992, Roenick reached the
Stanley Cup Finals with the Blackhawks. They lost in a sweep. Since
then, he has missed two postseasons due to injury _ both courtesy
of Dallas' Derian Hatcher _ and found success wildly fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we lost in the Finals to Pittsburgh, I said, `It's OK.
I'll be back here some day,' '' Roenick said. ``I haven't had a
sniff since.''
</P>
<P>
   Now this. Ironic for a guy who lives next door to owner Richard
Burke, but Roenick has never felt so removed. He is powerless,
aching to be needed, lusting to be part of the quest. But as they
get ready to hoist the curtain and get on with a defining
postseason in the life of the Phoenix Coyotes, Roenick has one last
message to his teammates:
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget about me,'' he said. ``That would be perfect. Don't
think about me for one moment. The emphasis has to be on Keith
Tkachuk, Rick Tocchet, Nikolai Khabibulin. They're the ones who
have to do this. I'm not part of it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm behind them 100 percent, but this has to be about the
Phoenix Coyotes. Not about Jeremy Roenick's injury. This is the
playoffs, and they have a job to do.'' &QL;

AMERICANS WHO FIGHT FOR BALKAN COUNTRIES RISK PROSECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans who involve themselves in the Balkan
wars, like the ethnic Albanians who have joined the Kosovo rebels,
are venturing into a no man's land, legally speaking.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of Americans fighting on foreign soil under a
foreign flag raises, once again, the possibility of prosecutions
under neutrality laws, the most important of which bars anyone in
the United States from taking part in or aiding any military
expedition against ``any foreign prince or state, or of any colony,
district or people with whom the United States is at peace.''
</P>
<P>
   That language is from the Neutrality Act of 1794, enacted by the
fledgling United States of America to keep adventurers from getting
it into wars with more powerful countries. The law carries a prison
sentence of up to three years and a fine of up to $3,000, which was
a lot of money in 1794.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the State and Justice Departments have been
conferring on what, if anything, to do about Americans who have
gone overseas to fight under the red and black flag of the Kosovo
Liberation Army. They made it clear that it is a decision they
would just as soon not have to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fascinating, but at this point we don't have a clear-cut
answer,'' a Justice Department official said. ``Any determination
whether an individual has violated any statute would have to be
based on the individual facts of that case.''
</P>
<P>
   And what if Americans of Serbian descent choose to fight for
Slobodan Milosevic? ``We would find that question equally
complex,'' a Justice Department representative said, adding that
such cases will have to be judged on an individual basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see less fighting in Kosovo, not more,'' a State
Department official said, advising would-be volunteers to check
with a lawyer first.
</P>
<P>
   But a lawyer might be at a loss to give clear advice.
Enforcement of the neutrality laws has been selective over the
years, and some of the words are less precise than they might seem.
America is not exactly ``at peace'' with Yugoslavia. But the United
States has not been in a declared war since 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was more or less ``at peace'' with Germany in
1940, when some Americans joined the Royal Air Force to fight for
Britain, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt was tilting heavily
toward that country. Spokesmen in the State and Justice Departments
said that to the best of their knowledge no Americans were
prosecuted for fighting against Germany before the United States
entered World War II, or for fighting in Spain on behalf of the
republic against the fascist rebels in the late 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, when Robert Kennedy was attorney general, the top
law enforcement official of the United States, he said loose
enforcement of the neutrality laws was just fine. ``Clearly, they
were not designed for the kind of situation which exists in the
world today,'' he said just after the Bay of Pigs debacle of 1961.
He said the neutrality laws were not violated by the United
States-supported invasion of Cuba, a country with which the United
States was officially ``at peace,'' more or less.
</P>
<P>
   True, the invading force of Cuban exiles had been partly
organized in the United States and, yes, the CIA had backed the
enterprise. But the immediate base for the invasion was Central
America, not the United States, the attorney general argued.
</P>
<P>
   Many charges arose against many defendants in the Iran-contra
affair, involving the sale of arms to Iran and the diversion of
some profits to American-backed rebels fighting the Nicaraguan
government. But neutrality laws were seldom mentioned, even though
American support of insurgents fighting a government with which the
United States was at peace would seem to have been in violation of
those laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Logan Act, enacted in 1799, also falls under the rubric of
neutrality laws. Basically, it prohibits American citizens from
unauthorized negotiating with foreign governments on matters of
policy.
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever been convicted under the Logan Act, although in
1980 the Senate urged the attorney general's office to prosecute
anyone who violated it. That Senate resolution was passed with a
former attorney general in mind _ Ramsey Clark, who was one of 10
Americans who visited Iran for a conference on possible crimes
committed by the United States during the reign of the deposed Shah
Mohammed Riza Pahlevi.
</P>
<P>
   As for Americans fighting under foreign flags, professor Barry
Carter of Georgetown University Law School called it ``a
time-honored tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Some adventurers are part of national lore, others all but
forgotten. ``Davy Crockett and his volunteers fought in Mexican
territory at the Alamo,'' Carter observed. And died there, he might
have added.
</P>
<P>
   Carter recalled that a California lawyer named William Walker
organized a force of some 60 men who invaded Nicaragua in 1855 with
dreams of creating an empire throughout Central America. Walker
actually became president of Nicaragua for a short time.
</P>
<P>
   Troops from neighboring countries ousted Walker, but he never
faced trial for violating neutrality laws. He did face a firing
squad, however.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Joseph Chebet of Kenya enjoyed his trips to the United
States, even if he was always second best. He ran second in the
1997 New York City Marathon, second in last year's Boston Marathon
and second in last year's New York City Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to be second,'' he said Monday, and he is second
no more. Monday afternoon, in the 103th annual Boston Marathon, the
28-year-old Chebet took the lead with four miles to go and won by
200 yards over Silvio Guerra of Ecuador. Chebet ran the 26 miles
385 yards from suburban Hopkinton to the Back Bay section of Boston
in 2 hours 9 minutes 52 seconds, not quite pedestrian time, but not
exceptional either.
</P>
<P>
   While Chebet was piling up those second places, Fatuma Roba was
winning. The 27-year-old Ethiopian won the 1996 Olympic marathon in
Atlanta and the 1997 and 1998 races here. Monday, she made it three
consecutive Boston victories, a feat achieved officially only by
Uta Pippig of Germany from 1994 through 1996.
</P>
<P>
   For half the women's race, Sun Yingjie of China, who at age 20
was running her fifth marathon, set a suicidal pace close to that
of the men's leaders. But when Roba stepped up her pace, she passed
the fading Sun, shook off Catherine Ndereba of Kenya and won
comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   Roba finished 700 yards ahead of Franziska Rochat-Moser of
Switzerland in 2:23:25, the 15th fastest time in history. She
dismissed that, saying, ``I was expecting a better time _ 2:21 or
2:22.''
</P>
<P>
   The race sponsors, led by John Hancock, put up $525,000 in prize
money. Chebet and Roba collected $80,000 each. In addition, Roba
received an appearance fee of perhaps $80,000 and Chebet a lesser
amount.
</P>
<P>
   This was Patriots Day, a Massachusetts holiday that commemorates
the skirmishes in suburban Lexington and Concord that touched off
the Revolutionary War. There were 12,797 men and women running in
this, the world's oldest and most storied marathon. With the
starting-time temperature at 60 degrees and a westerly breeze to
the runners' backs, it was a nice day for a marathon.
</P>
<P>
   A Kenyan man won for the ninth year in a row. Nine Kenyan men
ran, and the best of them finished first, fifth, sixth, 10th, 12th
and 15th, their weakest performance in years. Moses Tanui, the
Kenyan who won the last two years and three of the last four, was
running eighth when he dropped out after 22 miles.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of the men's race, no one was brave or
foolhardy enough to force the pace. After 16 miles, Guerra had
enough of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling great and strong,'' he said. ``I'm still trying
to learn how to run a marathon. I go out to try and win the race,
but with a marathon you never know. I tried to win it, and to win a
race you have to take risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerra took the lead and stepped up the pace, and in Newton, on
the first of four hills that end with Heartbreak Hill, he ran an
uphill mile in 4 minutes 50 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   That shook off many contenders. It also left Guerra with big
foot blisters that forced him to back off a bit. Chebet, always
close, passed Guerra after 22 miles, and Chebet, although he tired
noticeably toward the finish, was never threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was worried about Guerra,'' Chebet said. ``After I passed
him, I was worried about someone else catching me, so I pushed very
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the women's race, Roba had every reason to worry. Sun,
the Chinese upstart, was running either the fastest race in history
or one of the most indiscreet.
</P>
<P>
   With a stiff, upright stride, arms hardly bent, she looked as if
she were trying to run through a bad case of arthritis. But she was
running comfortably alongside John Campbell of New Zealand,
history's fastest over-40 male runner, and after three miles she
was 300 yards ahead of Roba.
</P>
<P>
   Roba treated the situation as a distraction rather than a
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first,'' she said, ``I didn't realize that there was
somebody out in front of me. When I did, I picked up my pace
some.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun drifted back and finished 11th in 2:37:11. She left Roba to
battle it out with Ndereba, who dominated the American road-race
circuit last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyan women won major marathons Sunday in London and Rotterdam,
but there would be no weekend trifecta. For four miles, Roba and
Ndereba ran together. When Roba decided to take off after 17 miles,
they bumped slightly and muttered apologies. Then Roba left, and
Ndereba retreated to sixth place in 2:28:27.
</P>
<P>
   There were cheers for Roba all along the course from the large
Ethiopian community here. After 20 miles, two spectators waving an
Ethiopian flag started running behind her. They handed her a
headband in the green, yellow and red of the Ethiopian flag. She
put it on her wrist and then on her head.
</P>
<P>
   She was struggling slightly at the end and Rochat-Moser was
closing strongly, but too far back. Still, there was redemption of
sorts for Rochat-Moser. She has struggled since she won the New
York City Marathon in 1997, partly because she spends so much time
running her Michelin three-star restaurant, Girardet, in Crissier,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``My aim was to run my personal record,'' she said. And she did,
finishing in 2:25:51.
</P>
<P>
   For Roba and Chebet, there was big prize money and glory. For
Guerra, second in the men's race, there was less prize money
($40,000), less glory and a lesson for someone who started running
marathons only two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no regrets,'' he said. ``During a race, you do not have
too much time to think, so whenever you feel good you have to go
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Would he do anything differently?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said. ``I would have won the race.''
</P>
<P>
   FINISHING KICKS
</P>
<P>
   The leading American finishers were 38-year-old Lynn Jennings of
Newmarket, N.H., 12th among the women in 2:38:37, and 32-year-old
Joe LeMay of Danbury, Conn., 13th among the men in 2:16:11. This
was the first official marathon for the 38-year-old Jennings, one
of the world's leading distance runners.
</P>
<P>
   At 51, Bill Rodgers, a four-time Boston and four-time New York
winner, was running his first serious marathon in seven years. He
dropped out atop Heartbreak Hill, almost 21 miles into the race,
because of dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   The wheelchair winners were Franz Neitlispach of Switzerland
(1:21:36) and Louise Sauvage of Australia (1:42:23), each for the
third consecutive year. For the second year in a row, Jean Driscoll
of Champaign, Ill., finished second in the same time as Sauvage.

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS CAN BE BEST-OF-SEVEN MIND GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They stand behind the benches in fine suits, regally overlooking
the mayhem occurring before them, acting as if they are above it
all.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe it. Come playoff time, NHL head coaches are
nothing more than well-dressed Eddie Haskells, willing to try
anything to give their teams an edge in pursuit of the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   They will have players sport fake casts and arrange for
opponents to gag on paint fumes before a game. They even have been
known to throw change on the ice and then, with the feigned
innocence of a professional wrestler who has just placed brass
knuckles back in his trunks, blame it on unruly fans.
</P>
<P>
   Practically anything goes in the NHL playoffs, and it's all
passed off under the title of gamesmanship, a time-honored
tradition that helps make hockey's playoffs more intriguing than
any other professional sport's.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are trying to find that one little edge, someplace,
somewhere,'' said Mike Keenan, a former NHL coach who has coached
in four Stanley Cup finals, winning once. ``Sometimes, it takes on
its own drama and that's what makes it fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Emotion plays a bigger role in hockey than perhaps any other
sport. The game is so fast that strategy can be quickly rendered
useless, leaving emotion and effort as the only constants.
Preparing a team mentally during a long series can be as important
as any game-planning a coach does.
</P>
<P>
   That's why you will see coaches go to odd lengths in attempts to
inspire their teams, relieve the pressure on their players,
influence officials and rattle opponents.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes the NHL playoffs, which begin Wednesday, not
only about delivering hits, but about pitching fits. It's a time
for stingy goaltending and creative mindbending.
</P>
<P>
   The current master of mental gymnastics is Detroit Coach Scotty
Bowman, who has coached eight Stanley Cup champions, including the
Red Wings, who have won two straight.
</P>
<P>
   When St. Louis, the Coyotes' first-round opponent beginning
Thursday, played Detroit in the playoffs in 1996 and 1997, the
Blues were greeted by a freshly painted locker room in Joe Louis
Arena. The fumes were overwhelming even after the Blues tried to
clear the air by running floor fans around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably coincidental but Detroit went on to win each
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That room has had eight coats of paint the last two years,''
St. Louis defenseman Marc Bergevin told reporters last year. ``It
looks nice, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Few hockey coaches can match Keenan's love of gamesmanship. His
plans usually were as orchestrated as a symphony and accompanied by
media anxious for an interesting angle.
</P>
<P>
   There is an art to gamesmanship, said Keenan, fired this year by
Vancouver and now living in Florida. The best practitioners are
those who are in tune with their surroundings and intuitively know
what's needed in different situations.
</P>
<P>
   It's Zen mixed with a dash of used car salesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be able to read the situation, read the team, read
the needs and know what might be sellable with officials, the
league and . . .the fans,'' Keenan said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in 1992 Keenan's team, the Chicago Blackhawks,
were playing Pittsburgh in the Stanley Cup finals. One of Keenan's
best players, Jeremy Roenick, now with the Coyotes, was nursing a
sprained thumb, and Keenan was concerned the Penguins might go
after Roenick's injury.
</P>
<P>
   So rather than hide Roenick's wounded digit, Keenan made the
thumb a central part of the finals. He had Roenick show up to
practice in a cast. Roenick, normally friendly to the media, then
declined to answer questions about it.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan accused the Penguins of going after Roenick's thumb,
although he produced no videotape to prove it. But for a few days,
Roenick's thumb stood as tall in Chicago as the Sears Tower.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackhawks lost the series, 4-0, but not because Pittsburgh
went after Roenick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly drew it to the attention of the officials,''
Keenan said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the mind games become laughable as coaches try
anything to gain an edge. Players are accustomed to skating on bad
ice in practice sessions on the road, or having a Zamboni blocking
the entrance to the rink. The fact that grown, well-paid men dream
up these schemes is amusing to some.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called overthinking,'' said Charlie Simmer, a former NHL
player and color broadcaster for the Coyotes. ``There are only so
many ways you can cut a board. Some just do it better than
others.''
</P>
<P>
   The Valley received its first taste of NHL gamesmanship two
years ago in the Coyotes' first season here, when they met the
Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Ducks Coach Ron Wilson, unhappy with the way his star, Paul
Kariya, was being slapped around by Phoenix, warned the Coyotes
that Roenick and Keith Tkachuk had better have their helmets on
tight.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson wasn't serious about going after the Coyotes' stars. He
just wanted the referees to protect Kariya as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember the series changing any,'' said Bobby Smith,
the Coyotes general manager, whose team ended up losing in seven
games. ``But Tkachuk and Roenick spent two days answering questions
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   One purpose of gamesmanship is to reach the referees through the
media, thus influencing a series.
</P>
<P>
   Smith doesn't think referees pay attention to what's written or
broadcast but Keenan disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (referees) tell you they don't read anything, but they
read everything,'' Keenan said. ``And if they don't read, someone
tells them about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The media are often used as tools, and coaches like Keenan and
Bowman know their audiences. In a seven-game series, reporters are
eager for new and different angles. Keenan, Bowman and others have
masterfully provided them, lobbying referees and deflecting
attention and pressure from their teams in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus of the media is so much more intense as you go from
16 teams to eight teams to four teams,'' Smith said. ``It can be
used . . . to get a distraction. If you want to take the focus off
your goaltender for a couple days, you create something.''
</P>
<P>
   When Keenan was with the Blues in '96, he made a big deal out of
the size of the visiting bench area in Detroit's Joe Louis Arena.
Too small, Keenan said. Visiting teams didn't have enough room for
line changes.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan's charges were proven correct and changes were made. But
his main objective was not in securing larger bench accommodations.
It was deflecting attention from goalie Jon Casey, who was playing
in place of an injured Grant Fuhr.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about hockey gamesmanship is that the masters of
it admit it, as least after the statute of limitations has expired.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, St. Louis Coach Jacques Demers twice dropped pennies on
the ice to delay play in a playoff game against the Minnesota North
Stars. The joke was that he chose pennies because, as the league's
lowest paid coach, he couldn't afford more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had killed four penalties in a row and I did it to rest our
guys,'' he said a year later. ``I'll never do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds a little like Dennis the Menace promising to stay
out of Mr. Wilson's flower bed, hockey people understand. At
playoff time, almost everything said and done comes with an implied
wink.
</P>
<P>
   The purists hope that it stays that way, that television,
corporate sponsors and the league office don't pour antiseptic over
the game and try to sanitize it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have some bacteria somewhere,'' Keenan said.
``It's the last frontier, isn't it?'' &QL;

HARD TO WIN A MARATHON ON THE COUCH 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - I woke up Monday morning and turned on my TV. A guy on
ESPN2 said ``And ``off'' they go!''
</P>
<P>
   I read Dear Abby. Had breakfast. Shaved. Showered. Dressed.
Drove to work.
</P>
<P>
   When I arrived at the office, the TV announcer was interviewing
a small man wearing a medal that weighed more than he does.
</P>
<P>
   His gold laurel wreath brought to mind Caesar in ``The Ten''
``Commandments''.``''
</P>
<P>
   It was over.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Chebet already had won the Boston Marathon. The man ran
26.2 miles in 2 hours, 9 minutes and 52 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   When he broke the tape, he wasn't even breathing hard.
</P>
<P>
   They just keep going and going . . . &QL; 
Marathon runners are put on this earth for one reason. To make the
rest of us feel inferior and guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Human beings who run 26 miles in the time one can play nine
holes in a cart are almost as amazing as those bicyclists in the
Tour de France. The race starts in June. As the contestants depart,
the French people blow kisses and shower them with crepes. Here in
the States, we shrug and forget about them.
</P>
<P>
   Time passes.
</P>
<P>
   We celebrate the Fourth of July. Take family vacations. When we
return home two weeks later, tanned and rested, these guys are
still at it, hunched over their handlebars, legs churning
furiously, pedaling up the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what the TV ratings were for the Boston Marathon.
Probably not good.
</P>
<P>
   The race began at 9 a.m. Arizona time and went head-to-head with
Sally Jessy Raphael. Monday's show: unfaithful men are confronted
with proof.
</P>
<P>
   A good reason to ``start'' running _ and not stop.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much to watch, really. A river of humanity flows
away from the starting line. Spectators lining the streets cheer
and wave. Soon the contenders _ who measure .00013 percent body fat
_ separate themselves from the pack. They run uphill. Downhill.
Heartbreak Hill doesn't faze them.
</P>
<P>
   Eyes straight ahead.
</P>
<P>
   One foot in front of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Determined.
</P>
<P>
   Relentless.
</P>
<P>
   Marathon runners are like Buck Showalter. Their expression never
changes.
</P>
<P>
   How can they endure? Do they run on batteries? Or do you wind
them up, like a toy with a key?
</P>
<P>
   To win the Boston Marathon, the first thing you do is move to
Kenya. Actually, that's the second thing. The first thing is to
change your diet. No more pizza and cheesecake. It's bird seed from
now on.
</P>
<P>
   Then you move to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Chebet is a Kenyan. A Kenya runner has won the last nine Boston
Marathons. Opinion is divided over why athletes from that land now
dominate long-distance running. Is it genetics? Altitude? Training
techniques? Lifestyle?
</P>
<P>
   The book ``Kenyan Running'' alludes to the ``romantic myth'' of
a simple essential Africa in which young children run endlessly
across the plains to school.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Kenyans are just more dedicated. Perhaps they win because
they work harder. That's usually how it goes in life.
</P>
<P>
   Life, liberty, pursuit of laziness &QL; 
Americans once dominated the Boston Marathon. But an American male
hasn't won since 1983, an American woman since '85.
</P>
<P>
   I was hoping Bill Rodgers might win again until I read he is 50
years old.
</P>
<P>
   Although many Americans exercise, even more don't, choosing
instead to lie on the couch and watch TV or read paperbacks such as
the one called ``The Non-Runner's Book,'' advertised as a manual of
tips for the listless majority and advice for the preferably prone.
</P>
<P>
   The book suggests that non-running can be enjoyed by anyone, at
any time. It points out that once a person starts to not run it is
hard to stop.
</P>
<P>
   I have my own theory why Americans don't win the Boston Marathon
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   In this country most of us ask ourselves, ``Why run when I can
ride?''
</P>
<P>
   That's why NASCAR is so popular. &QL;

FORMER DOBSON QB LEIGH SIGNS AS FREE AGENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quarterback  &UR; Graham Leigh is glad there is film of his junior
season at New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put on the games, and he's throwing the ball on rhythm,''
Cardinals scout  &UR; Cole Proctor said of the Mesa Dobson High School
product. ``He's moving the football team. He was an exciting
quarterback making plays on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh, who agreed to terms on a rookie free-agent deal with the
Cardinals on Monday, was the Western Athletic Conference Mountain
Division Offensive Player of the Year in 1997. He threw for 2,318
yards and 24 touchdowns and eas intercepted only eight times. He
also rushed for 528 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But following the season, Lobos Coach  &UR; Dennis Franchione left
for Texas Christian University and was replaced by  &UR; Rocky
Long. &UR; Leigh had a poor senior year and was intercepted 17 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change in coaching staff really hurt him,'' said Proctor,
the Cardinals' West Coast scout. ``In 1997, it was a completely
different picture. He has a great opportunity to redeem himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh, who grew up in Chandler, three miles from the team's
Tempe training facility, will compete with seventh-round draft pick
 &UR; Chris
 &UR; Greisen for the No. 3 quarterback job.
</P>
<P>
   He chose the Cardinals over the San Francisco 49ers, the Oakland
Raiders and the Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else could he go and he have a 50 percent chance of
making the team?'' Cardinals offensive coordinator  &UR; Marc Trestman
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last year, Leigh was projected as a 1999
third-round draft pick. A year later, he wasn't selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through a lot (Sunday), having to sit through the whole
draft,'' said Leigh, who will graduate with an engineering degree
in May. ``I know I ranked a lot higher after my junior year. My
senior year, hurt me a lot _ new coaches, new system, a really
young team. I'm confident I'm the quarterback people saw in the '97
film.'' &QL; 
Recent additions
</P>
<P>
   Leigh was the only rookie free agent signing confirmed by the
Cardinals, with the rest of the list announced today.
</P>
<P>
   Three other rookie free agents apparently have agreed to terms _
offensive linemen  &UR; Kevin Swillis of California and  &UR; John Feugill of
Maryland and punter  &UR; Jeff Roberts of Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, 6-foot-3, 207 pounds, will compete with veteran  &UR; Scott
Player for the punting job. &QL; 
Good humor guys
</P>
<P>
   First-round draft picks  &UR; David Boston, wide receiver from Ohio
State, and  &UR; L.J. Shelton, offensive tackle from Eastern Michigan,
and fifth-round pick  &UR; Yusuf Scott, offensive guard from Arizona,
met the Valley's media on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Boston couldn't stop laughing at the one-liners from Shelton and
Scott, who offered to bring his homemade barbecue sauce to the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the best barbecue sauce in town,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton was asked about the possibility of replacing seven-time
Pro Bowler  &UR; Lomas Brown at left offensive tackle. ``More than I've
heard about replacing Lomas, I've heard about protecting our
big-money quarterback,'' Shelton said of starter  &UR; Jake Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who weighs 320 pounds, also had Plummer on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to work out a deal because my running back in Arizona,
 &UR; Trung Canidate, took me out to eat dinner after each game,'' Scott
said. ``So, Jake will have to take me out, and I'll take care of
him, too.'' &QL; 
On the mend
</P>
<P>
   Starting running back  &UR; Adrian Murrell likely will not
participate in drills at next week's three-day minicamp after
undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his left knee two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Murrell, who suffered a slight tear of his meniscus ligament, is
expected to be at full strength for training camp in July. &QL;

KIDD MAKING NAME AS SHOOTING STAR  
 DEDICATION, CONFIDENCE ARE DIFFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ When Jason Kidd entered the NBA as a 21-year-old rookie
in 1994, it was apparent that only one thing would determine
whether Kidd became a great player or just another good one.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd shot just 38.5 percent that first season with the Dallas
Mavericks, yet he still shared the NBA's Rookie of the Year award
with Detroit's Grant Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The book on Kidd was that if he could improve enough as a
shooter to hit 45 percent of his shots, he would be an unstoppable
force with his ball-handling, strength, vision and passing skills.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd admits he wasn't dedicated enough early in his career to
improve his shooting. That is one of the reasons the Mavericks
traded Kidd to Phoenix the day after Christmas in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   There were those in the Dallas franchise who didn't believe Kidd
would develop the ability to shoot, and thus shouldn't be the
centerpiece of a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks, who play host to the Suns tonight, have lived to
regret that decision. The Suns have lost only one game to the
Mavericks since the trade. And Kidd has improved his shooting each
season he has been in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to build a base to work from, and I've done that
since I came here (to the Suns),'' Kidd said. ``I think it just
comes from not being satisfied, and building some confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be a guy, when my career is over, who was
considered a good player that could have been a great player if I
could shoot it better,'' Kidd said.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd is shooting the ball this season better than he has at
anytime in his career _ 44 percent going into tonight's game. He
set a goal of shooting 45 percent this season, 35 percent from
three-point range and 82 percent from the free throw line.
</P>
<P>
   Those were ambitious marks considering Kidd's 41.3 percent last
season was a career best, and that his career mark from three-point
range was 32.1 and from the free-throw line was 71.4.
</P>
<P>
   But Kidd has come close. He's ahead of the three-point goal,
hitting 39.1 percent, and is making 76.2 percent of his free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd was named the NBA's Player of the Week on Monday for
averaging 22.8 points, 10.5 assists and 5.0 rebounds last week.
It's the first time this season Kidd has won the honor, the fifth
time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason is learning the game all the time,'' Suns Coach Danny
Ainge said. ``I think he's a lot better player this season than
he's ever been, and one of the areas he has improved the most is in
his shooting. He's more aggressive in looking for his shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot less hesitation than I've seen in the past. Jason
is about winning, and he knows his shooting is an important part of
uf winning.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean Kidd has become selfish. In fact, he leads the
NBA in assists with 10.8 a game.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he'll probably never have the no-conscience approach
of pure shooters. But for the first time in his career, Kidd sees
opponents respecting his shot. Throughout his previous four NBA
years, virtually every team would defend Kidd on pick-and-roll
players by having his defender slide below the pick.
</P>
<P>
   It is conceding an open jump shot. But now many teams are coming
over the pick to defend Kidd, a sign that he can't be counted on to
miss. And that creates opportunities for others from the
pick-and-roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can continue to knock down shots, it makes everyone else
get easier shots,'' Kidd said.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd has taken his shooting to a new level in April, making 56.4
percent of his shots and 16 of 32 three-pointers. It's not a
coincidence that the Suns are having their best month as a team
with a 7-3 mark in April.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd credits his wife, Joumana, for encouraging him to work on
his marksmanship, and assistant coach Frank Johnson and strength
coach Robin Pound, who work with him daily.
</P>
<P>
   He's even starting to make a little pocket change occasionally
in shooting games with his teammates and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never used to get in those games when I was in my first
couple of years in the league,'' he said. ``I usually just went
home after practice. Now I try to get in games with our better
shooters. You don't want to be considered one of your team's best
players if you can't even win any of the shooting games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to win them all, but I can win two or three
times a week. That's a lot better than in the past.''
</P>

SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE ON SELF-REPRESENTATION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide whether
people convicted of crimes have a constitutional right to represent
themselves on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   A California inmate _ representing himself _ persuaded the court
to hear the case. The justices will decide whether to extend to
appeals the right of self-representation the court established for
criminal trials nearly 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Faretta vs. California, in 1975, the court ruled that the
right to dispense with a lawyer and defend oneself at trial was an
inherent part of the Sixth Amendment right to present a legal
defense in a criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   While that amendment is best known for guaranteeing ``the
assistance of counsel,'' the court emphasized in the 1975 ruling
that a lawyer ``shall be an aid to a willing defendant _ not an
organ of the state interposed between an unwilling defendant and
his right to defend himself personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that most defendants are not likely to do as well
in court as most lawyers, the court said then, ``Personal liberties
are not rooted in the law of averages.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there has been disagreement among state and lower
federal courts over whether the principle of self-representation
also applies to appeals. The case the justices accepted Monday is
both an unlikely vehicle for a Supreme Court ruling and at the same
time a telling example of the dilemma for the legal system posed by
a defendant whose desire to tell his own story is not matched by
his legal training or acumen.
</P>
<P>
   Inexpertly typed in all capital letters, the petition was filed
by Salvador Martinez, a California man who was convicted of
embezzlement after representing himself at trial last year.
Applying longstanding state precedents, the California appellate
courts refused to let Martinez represent himself in his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   A state agency in California provides appellate lawyers for
indigent defendants and requires the lawyers to meet specific
standards in preparing their cases. Martinez did not explain to the
justices why he had not chosen to accept the state's help. In fact,
he offered no legal argument at all, simply listing the lower court
rulings that demonstrated the existence of conflicting judicial
views.
</P>
<P>
   His success in getting the justices' attention was nonetheless
notable; fewer than 2 percent of all cases filed at the court are
ever granted. But having brought his case this far, Martinez may be
disappointed to learn that he will not be able to argue it himself
when the court hears it next fall; he is not a member of the
Supreme Court's bar, and the justices, following their normal
practice, will appoint someone who is.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the question presented by the case, Martinez vs.
California, No. 98-7809, is not obvious because appeals stand on a
very different footing than trials. While the right to a trial is
guaranteed, the court has long made it clear that there is no
constitutional right to an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   All states do provide for appeals, and the court ruled in 1963
that when they do so, they must provide lawyers for indigent
defendants so as not to make the appeal a ``meaningless ritual.''
Nonetheless, a defendant does not necessarily have the right to be
in the courtroom during an appellate argument, while a defendant's
presence at trial is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   In opposing Martinez's appeal, California Attorney General Bill
Lockyer told the court that nothing in the Constitution's text
guaranteed the right to self-representation on appeal and that
``there is simply no good reason to alter years of fundamental
understanding'' by creating such a right.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer said defendants who represent themselves on appeal could
be expected to place new burdens on the legal system, requiring
judges and prosecutors to decipher poorly written material.
</P>
<P>
   The court may find that argument to be a weighty one. Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist, the only current justice who was on
the court when the Faretta decision established the right to
self-representation at trial, was one of three dissenters from that
decision. He joined a dissent by Warren E. Burger, then the chief
justice, who objected that the ruling ``can only add to the
problems of an already malfunctioning criminal justice system.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These were among the other developments at the court Monday:
</P>
<P>
   Obscene e-mail
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, the court upheld a ruling by a special
three-judge federal District Court here last year that a federal
law outlawing the transmission of obscene e-mail or faxes does not
violate the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The challenged provision of the Telecommunications Act of 1996
refers not only to obscene messages but also to those that are
``lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent'' _ all types of speech
that enjoy constitutional protection. However, the District Court
accepted the government's position that the law should be
interpreted to apply only to obscenity, which has no constitutional
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Appollomedia Corp. vs. Reno, No. 98-933, was brought
by a San Francisco company that maintains a Web site through which
users can send indecent messages to public officials and others.
</P>
<P>
   Deportation Case
</P>
<P>
   Also without comment, the court turned down a request to
reconsider its 6-to-3 ruling last month that foreigners facing
deportation for their political activities cannot raise a First
Amendment challenge claiming that they were unconstitutionally
selected for deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing eight Palestinians facing deportation for
their activities on behalf of the Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine argued that the decision last month, Reno vs.
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, No. 97-1252, was
procedurally unfair because the court had told the parties that it
would not decide the free speech issue.
</P>
<P>
   Because the court's focus appeared to be only on procedural
issues, the Palestinians' lawyers did not file a brief on the First
Amendment question. ``The court reached its result without even
hearing from the people it has now effectively silenced,'' the
lawyers told the justices in their petition for a rehearing.

EX-COMPAQ CHIEF PFEIFFER SAYS OUSTER WAS DESIGNED TO PLACATE WALL
STREET 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Although he hesitates to use the word ``scapegoat,''
Eckhard Pfeiffer said Monday that his abrupt weekend ouster as
leader of Compaq Computer Corp. was designed to mollify Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   An unbowed Pfeiffer also said that his controversial statements
that the entire PC industry is slowing ultimately will be proved
correct.
</P>
<P>
   The 57-year-old German native lost his job Sunday because, key
board members said, the company had not been executing well on its
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to appease the financial community, you create a
shakeup,'' Pfeiffer said. ``That, at least, seems to wipe the page
clean and you start from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that is subject to execution, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl Mason, Compaq's chief financial officer, also resigned
Sunday to become the chief executive at Chicago-based Alliant
Foodservice. Mason insists his departure was coincidental and not
related to Pfeiffer's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   The departures capped a tumultuous nine days for the computer
maker, which is Houston's largest company in terms of revenues.
</P>
<P>
   On April 9, Pfeiffer and Mason warned that Compaq's
first-quarter profits would be half what analysts were expecting,
citing dropping prices, cutthroat competition and softening demand
for business PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer said the conditions were industrywide, but when the
leaders of other computer makers began saying otherwise, analysts
and investors started questioning Pfeiffer's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``That created, let me say, frustration and a lack of
credibility with the financial community,'' Pfeiffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Rosen, the venture capitalist who loaned Compaq's founders
$20,000 to start the company, is now running Compaq along with two
other board members, Frank Doyle and Ted Enloe. The three are
overseeing the computer maker's day-to-day operations in an
``office of the chief executive.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the second time Rosen has engineered the departure of a
chief executive. In October 1991, Rosen moved to fire co-founder
Rod Canion, who seemed unable to adapt to a growing demand for
low-cost PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in somber tones and without bitterness, Pfeiffer urged
the triumvirate to quickly hire a new chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had better hurry,'' he said. ``I don't think the current
team is the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Sunday announcement came as a surprise, Pfeiffer
said he had been negotiating his possible departure over a period
of weeks _ even as he appeared poised and confident hosting
Compaq's biennial Innovate Forum 99 trade show last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That discussion went on for quite a while,'' he said. ``We
talked about management structure and potential variations.''
</P>
<P>
   During Monday's interview, Pfeiffer frequently used the word
``we'' when referring to his former employer. At one point, he
laughed and apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, it doesn't go away that fast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday and again in a conference call with
analysts on Monday morning, Rosen said that the board had become
concerned that Compaq was not keeping ahead of industry trends and
not moving fast enough with regard to its Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But Pfeiffer asserted that Compaq ``had already been moving at
Internet speed _ plus a lot,'' and that its initiatives had already
made it No. 1 in many Internet-related areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we are one of the strongest Internet players, while
the perception is not as strong as the hard fact,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of speed, what people are confusing is what it takes
to integrate companies like Digital and Tandem in a matter of two
years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq bought Tandem Computer, which makes large computers used
in big businesses, and Digital Equipment Corp., over a two-year
period. Compaq is still in the process of integrating Digital.
</P>
<P>
   During the Innovate trade show, Pfeiffer unveiled a new strategy
to make Compaq the leader in supplying Internet-related hardware
and services to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take credit for pointing it in this direction,'' he said.
``We are the only major company in the industry that has a 100
percent focus on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rosen has embraced the Internet strategy but said he wants to
see Compaq move faster on it.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer also stuck to his guns regarding an overall PC industry
slowdown. He pointed to a comment from Intel Corp. that sales of
processors during the second quarter appear to be slowing.
</P>
<P>
   And he said that archrival Dell Computer Corp. actually came in
below expectations on its quarter. But because its fiscal year is
different from the rest of the industry, its slowdown was masked by
the timing of its quarterly report.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer said that, for the foreseeable future, he will remain
in Houston but will ``go where the next opportunity takes me.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer's separation agreement with Compaq, according to
documents filed with the Securities Exchange Commission, includes a
provision that he not work for a competitor for two years.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that does not stop him from working for another
high-tech company that does not compete with Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after you've run a $40 billion company, where do you go?''
he asked.

POWER PLAY IS KEY FOR DUCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- If the Mighty Ducks have one advantage against the
Detroit Red Wings in their upcoming playoff series, it figures to
be on the power play. Anaheim finished the season with the NHL's
No. 1-ranked power play unit (22 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks scored 83 power play goals, 18 more than the Red
Wings, who finished 10th (16.8 percent). The team's power play had
struggled through a 1-of-19 slump before scoring twice early in the
Ducks' 3-3 tie in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   That was a sight for the sore eyes of Anaheim coach Craig
Hartsburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power play is important to us,'' said Hartsburg, whose
team opens the playoffs in Detroit on Wednesday. ``Early in the
games, the power play can get you some momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg said he wasn't overly concerned about the power play,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lots of confidence in the guys on that unit,'' he said.
``Power plays can be hot and cold. You just have to stick with what
has had success and stay with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings certainly know how dangerous Anaheim is when it
gets the man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't take a lot of penalties,'' winger Brendan Shanahan
told Detroit reporters. ``We're going to preach a lot of
discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   -- On paper, the Anaheim-Detroit series appears to be an
open-and-shut case. It would seem to be a mere formality for the
Red Wings as they begin their quest for a third consecutive Stanley
Cup title.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Ducks are 4-15-5 all-time versus the Red Wings in
the regular season and are 1-8-3 in Detroit. Those numbers don't
include the Red Wings' four-game sweep of the Ducks in the second
round of the 1997 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's players and coaches are saying the right things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a good test for us,'' said Detroit assistant
coach Barry Smith. ``They've played much better as a team this year
than previously. It's not just a two-man team.''
</P>
<P>
   One newspaper columnist in Detroit thinks Anaheim is little more
than a bunch of sitting Ducks. He suggested the Red Wings would
much rather face them than San Jose or St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   He cited Detroit's superior depth, Guy Hebert's inexperience in
the playoffs, the Ducks' young defensemen, their dependence on
Kariya and Teemu Selanne and Chris Chelios' ability to intimidate
Kariya.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim winger Jim McKenzie knows a lot of stock shouldn't be
put in one writer's opinion, but also added such an article
``should'' motivate the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You use whatever you can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Right wing Teemu Selanne won the inaugural Rocket Richard
Trophy as the National Hockey League's top goal scorer. Selanne
scored 47 goals and had 60 assists in 75 games.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL introduced the trophy last June to honor Maurice
Richard, who was the first player in league history to score 50
goals in 50 games. Ironically, this was the first full season since
1969-70 that no player scored at least 50 goals.
</P>
<P>
   -- While the Ducks played before only nine sellout crowds at the
Pond this season, hockey fever is alive and well in Hockeytown. The
Red Wings sold out all 41 games at Joe Louis Arena. Detroit also
played before sellout crowds in 35 of 41 road games.
</P>
<P>
   -- Both the Ducks and Red Wings are relatively healthy as the
playoffs begin. Defensemen Uwe Krupp, who signed a four-year,
$16-million free-agent contract in the offseason, is out with a
herniated disk after playing only 22 games this season. His absence
was a big reason the Red Wings were forced to trade for defensemen
Chelios and Ulf Sammuelsson at the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings will also likely be without tough-guy winger Joey
Kocur due to a groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Pascal Trepanier, who was providing much-needed depth
for the Ducks on defense, is out after undergoing surgery for a
torn ACL in his right knee. He was hurt playing basketball during
an off-day on the team's last East Coast road trip.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie did not practice on Monday after being hitting in the
neck and jaw with a high stick by San Jose's Andrei Zyuzin on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel fine. I want to play, no question,'' said McKenzie, who
has a large welt on his neck. ``But it's going to be a trainer's
and doctor's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie wasn't exactly thrilled with the stickwork Zyuzin
displayed in what should have been a meaningless game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a four-year-old playing hockey and that's one of the
first things you teach -- keep your stick down,'' said McKenzie.
``Maybe he thought he was Luke Skywalker and I was Darth Vader.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Jason Marshall, Pavel Trnka and Marty McInnis all sat out the
final game in San Jose due to undisclosed injuries, but all are
expected to play against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   -- Who knows if Kings president Tim Leiweke will be rooting for
the rival Ducks to beat the Red Wings in the opening round, but
there's little question he hopes Detroit takes a fall somewhere
along the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Ottawa wins it all,'' Leiweke told reporters recently.
``They've done it the right way, building through the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiweke obviously has a hard time dealing with the approach
Detroit took at the trading deadline when the Red Wings traded for
high-piced veterans Chelios, Samuelsson, Wendel Clark and Bill
Ranford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm (understand) Detroit did, but at some point, everybody has
to look themselves in the mirror and ask whether it's all about
buying a Stanley Cup,'' said Leiweke, whose team will lose millions
this season. ``To go out and write checks for the Stanley Cup
destroys the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa, Leiweke's sentimental pick, was molded by current
Anaheim general manager Pierre Gauthier and is run by ex-Kings
excutive Roy Mlakar.

ANALYSIS: NEXT CHIEF OF COMPAQ MAY HAVE TO REINVENT IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Compaq Computer Corp. begins its search for a new chief
executive, it is clear that the prospective leader's first
challenge will be to chart a course from the brick-and-mortar
retailers that have been the company's lifeblood to the
direct-sales model that is increasingly defining the industry's
future, analysts and consultants said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard Pfeiffer, 57, was dismissed over the weekend by Compaq's
board, led by a company co-founder, Benjamin Rosen. Earl Mason,
Compaq's chief financial officer, also resigned to become chief
executive at an unidentified company. The announcement came nine
days after Compaq warned that its first-quarter income would be
about half what analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's problems stem from a strategy that has appeared to pull
the company in opposite directions at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, it has struggled to compete in the
personal-computer market with Dell Computer Corp., which sells
directly to buyers, avoiding the dealer channel and its markup, and
builds each machine to order, keeping inventories and costs at a
minimum.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Compaq, though its acquisitions of Digital
Equipment Corp. last year and Tandem Computer in 1997, has tried to
become a major systems company, like IBM Corp. and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that Compaq's strategy has been unraveling for
quite a few years now,'' said Regis McKenna, president of McKenna
Group, a management consulting firm based in Palo Alto, Calif.
``They're caught between the low end and the high end, and that's
why you see them constantly changing their mind. The first thing
they have to do is figure out what they want to be when they grow
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer succeeded Compaq's first chief executive, another
co-founder, Rod Canion, in 1991, in a coup also led by Rosen. He
aggressively lowered Compaq's cost structure to meet the challenge
of new competition, and the reduced costs allowed the Houston-based
company to gain the computer industry's leading market share while
maintaining decent profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   But by the late 1990s, as Compaq embraced the sub-$1,000 PC, its
growth came at the expense of profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   About 18 months ago, Compaq announced that it was moving to a
build-to-order business model, similar to Dell's, but that it would
retain its traditional distribution through the dealer channel, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Although Compaq did reduce internal inventory levels, it has
never matched Dell's operating efficiency, and it has continued to
lag behind Dell in growth. Dell has systematically sought out
Compaq's strongest markets, first in laptops and then in servers
and work stations, and has gained market share in each.
</P>
<P>
   Like Canion, who made an unsuccessful attempt to acquire Silicon
Graphics in the late 1980s, Pfeiffer looked to the high end of the
market to differentiate Compaq. The Tandem and Digital acquisitions
were meant to transform Compaq from the world's largest PC company
into a fully integrated computer systems company. Just as it had
passed IBM in personal-computer sales, so Compaq would come to lead
the systems business, Pfeiffer predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of goals he had sounded good to shareholders _ like
being a $50 billion company by the year 2000, or to beat IBM _ but
they didn't have anything to do with customers,'' said Mark
Anderson, president of Strategic News Service, a research firm
based in Friday Harbor, Wash. ``The new CEO should look at
everything Eckhard acquired and ask: Did the customer benefit from
that? If the answer isn't yes, they should get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he was not necessarily advocating the sale of
Digital, Tandem or any of the smaller companies Compaq acquired in
recent years, only their integration into a coherent strategy. ``If
you think of the Internet as the all-embracing future, as Ben Rosen
seems to suggest from his statements, it's not hard to see how the
parts of Compaq fit into that,'' he said. ``The new CEO should have
a clear focus on a single business plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest challenge facing Compaq's next leader is how
to differentiate the company's products at a time when the value of
brands has been diminished and personal computers sell almost
exclusively on the basis of price. While Apple Computer can command
a small premium based on the ease of use or on the attractive
design of its products, and Sun Microsystems flourishes as a
high-end technology company identified with the Internet, most
computer makers struggle to add value to a commodity product.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business has been assiduously destroying pricing and
profitability, bent on self-immolation,'' said Seymour Merrin,
president of Merrin Information Services, a consulting firm based
in Palo Alto. ``Compaq, more than any other vendor, has the
opportunity to do what Robert Crandall at American Airlines did
when he said, `The time has come to stop killing ourselves.' The
customer, if he perceives value, is willing to pay. What all the
companies have failed to do, with Compaq right at the front, is to
differentiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell prospers by offering performance at a price, rather than
just a low price, and by making the purchasing process more
pleasant, Merrin said. But he said he did not believe that Compaq
should emulate Dell by eliminating the dealer channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq can't do that,'' Merrin said. ``They have better
distribution than anyone else. A good percentage of their customers
are buying through dealers because they want to. What they should
do is set up a totally separate business unit'' for direct sales.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a consulting firm
in Cupertino, Calif., agreed. ``I don't think you can cut the
channel off, but what you have to do is take off the price
protection you give dealers,'' he said, referring to the common
practice of reimbursing dealers for price cuts affecting current
inventory. ``It's a new world and a new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The new chief executive Bajarin said, ``has to build a model
that says no matter what the customer wants to buy, no matter where
they want to buy it _ on the Internet, by telephone, in a
superstore _ Compaq has to make it available.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day of widespread losses among technology stocks, Compaq's
shares closed Monday at $22.75, down 87.5 cents, on trading of more
than 38 million shares.

GUERRA GOT CAUGHT AFTER ATTEMPTING A GETAWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Silvio Guerra never knew what caught him.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling strong and fit about 16 miles into Monday's Boston
Marathon, Guerra had made his move. He pulled away from a pack of
runners and kept going. He put some distance between himself and
the field. He led the race at 30 kilometers (18.64 miles) and 35
kilometers (21.74 miles).
</P>
<P>
   And then came Joseph Chebet.
</P>
<P>
   Guerra had a bit of a problem with blisters but was pretty much
maintaining his pace. Still, he could do little about Chebet at
that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him at the finish line, he said he was feeling too
good, very strong,'' said Luis Posso, Guerra's agent, in explaining
Guerra's breaking away. ``He didn't slow down. Chebet sped up. He
looked once and saw nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   He saw nobody, and went for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left, I just wanted to make a move and so I ran off,''
said Guerra. ``It was just a little move I did. When I saw nobody
was there, I started to push hard.''
</P>
<P>
   But soon Chebet came after Guerra hard, and blew by him just
after the 22-mile mark. From there, Guerra, 30, held on to finish a
solid second in 2:10:19 in his fourth marathon and first Boston.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of up-and-coming South Africans out of Johannesburg _
Frank Pooe, 25, in 2:11:37 and Abner Chipu, 27, in 2:12:46 _
grabbed the third and fourth spots in their first attempts here.
</P>
<P>
   There was little front-line drama at the finish: Chebet was 27
seconds in front of Guerra, Guerra was 78 seconds in front of Pooe,
and Pooe was 69 seconds in front of Chipu.
</P>
<P>
   Guerra provided the excitement midway through the marathon and
was racing to win when he broke things open.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first half of the race was not too fast,'' Guerra said.
``That's why I decided to go out after 25 kilometers. I was feeling
good. This is only my fourth marathon, so I'm still learning how to
run a marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win a race, you have to risk it,'' he said. ``I was feeling
good and I took the risk. When you feel good, you have to go for
it. If you can do it, good. If not, at least you tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerra ran a 2:14:02 in his marathon debut in Tokyo in 1997,
when he was paid to set the pace, said Posso. Later that year he
put up a 2:09:49 in Chicago, and he had a 2:12:30 in Paris last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Guerra was looking to win Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how it would be in the end,'' Guerra said. ``But
I was racing to win the race. I prepared myself training the last
six months and the last couple of months in Boulder. I was ready
for the race and to improve my time. I didn't do it, but I'm very
proud of the second place.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerra, Pooe, and Chipu established themselves even more as
forces to be dealt with down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Pooe, a late entrant who was racing outside South Africa for the
first time, got his third-place finish in a different manner than
Guerra came to second. Pooe was steady to Guerra's flashy.
</P>
<P>
   Pooe first broke into the Top 10 at the 20-kilometer checkpoint,
was up to fifth at 25 kilometers and third at 30 kilometers, then
held on. He would have liked to finish even more strongly.
</P>
<P>
   ``To run well against the Kenyans, you have to be clever and
save your energy to finish in a good position,'' Pooe said. ``The
last miles, I wasn't feeling so good, so I dropped back on my pace.
I was dehydrating. My finish wasn't so great, so I think I'll come
back and do it the next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pooe came to Boston off his second straight South African
national marathon championship in February. He won that race in
1998 in 2:13:09 and this year turned in a 2:12:40.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is quite an incredible achievement only two months after
that race,'' said Alec Riddle, a South African who is the agent for
Pooe's countryman, Chipu.
</P>
<P>
   Chipu, too, had an impressive run in his third marathon. A year
ago, he was working 12-hour days as a security guard. Last fall, he
signed on with Riddle and in January entered Max Africa, a camp
designed to develop the country's runners.
</P>
<P>
   Riddle was hoping for a Top Three finish from his runner but
will certainly take fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Posso felt all along that Guerra could contend at the front of
the pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning I told him, `You are at the same level as
everyone in the race and don't let them intimidate you,' '' Posso
said. ``I really believe he can run a 2:07. This gives him a lot of
confidence. Now he believes he can run with these guys.''

WALTER STRALEY, 86, SCHOOL LEADER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Walter William Straley, who, as an American Telephone
and Telegraph vice president for public relations in New York City,
was a member of the city's Board of Education in the late 1960s,
died in Seattle on Wednesday. Straley, who was 86, had moved to
Seattle with his wife in 1976 and was prominent in civic affairs
there.
</P>
<P>
   An advocate of school decentralization, he was involved in
controversy while on the 13-member school board, to which he was
named by Mayor John Lindsay in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   At a private meeting of the board in 1969, for instance, he
initiated an unsuccessful effort to force the resignation of a
minister, the Rev. Milton Galamison as vice president of the board.
It was a move to censure Galamison while letting him remain as a
board member. But it was opposed by 7 of the 10 board members who
were at the meeting. Besides Straley, two other board members, Rose
Shapiro and Morris Iushewitz, supported the move.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Galamison had announced that he intended to seek the
resignations of the city's superintendent of schools, Bernard
Donovan, and his chief deputy, Nathan Brown. He had charged that
the two officials had resisted efforts to bring about school
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The board rejected Galamison's resolution to that effect, but
Straley said Galamison's action in the matter made it impossible
for the minister to work effectively with Donovan and Brown.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Straley was named chairman of the National Reading
Council, formed to study problems in teaching reading and to
mobilize public and private support for government efforts to cope
with the problems.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the New York Urban Coalition and the Board of
Overseers of Grinnell College. He was also a trustee of the
National Council on Crime and Delinquency.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, before he worked in New York, he became founding
president of the former Pacific Northwest Bell in Seattle. After it
was merged into US West, he took the AT&AMP;T post in New York in 1966.
He retired from the telephone company in 1971 and was a consultant
to John Deere &AMP; Co. for a time.
</P>
<P>
   Straley, who was born in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, graduated in 1933
from Grinnell College.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Rachel Worthington; three
daughters, Mary Worthington of Santa Monica, Calif., and Jane
Skrivan and Martha Straley, both of Seattle; two sons, Hugh, of
Seattle, and John, of Sitka, Alaska; 10 grandchildren; and a
great-grandchild.

CITIGROUP POSTS 9 PERCENT RISE IN PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Citigroup, displaying the kind of raw earnings power promised by
the merger that created the financial services giant last year,
said first-quarter profits jumped 9 percent, surpassing analysts'
estimates and earnings posted by such well-known titans as General
Electric Co. and General Motors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, buoyed by strong results in both its consumer
business and the corporate business that caused it so many
headaches last year, earned $2.36 billion, or $1.01 a diluted
share, compared with $2.16 billion, or 90 cents a share, in the
first quarter of last year (last year's figures were adjusted as if
the merger, which closed last fall, had already occurred).
</P>
<P>
   To put that performance in perspective, Citigroup earned more in
the quarter than many other financial services companies, such as
J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., are likely to earn all year. Its Salomon Smith
Barney investment banking unit, just one component of Citigroup,
earned more in the quarter than Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. did in its
entirety in the same quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup also produced revenue gains more robust than many of
its competitors; it demonstrated that it has expenses under
control; it is getting solid returns from its investment banking
unit after reducing some of the riskier parts of that business, and
it already appears to have begun moving beyond the managerial and
operational problems that plagued it last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, many companies with big trading and securities
operations have been benefiting from an unusually quick and robust
turnaround from the volatility that afflicted international markets
last year. BankAmerica Corp., which posted strong earnings gains on
Monday, was also the beneficiary of outsized trading gains. Because
of that, some analysts were quick to sound a note of caution about
Citigroup's results.
</P>
<P>
   ``This quarter's numbers, while great, don't yet speak to the
integration of the company,'' said David Berry, an analyst with
Keefe, Bruyette and Woods Inc. ``The question is how reproducible
it will be going forward. It's often a mistake to annualize
quarterly results if part of it involves trading.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had been expecting Citigroup to generate earnings of 87
cents a share according to consensus estimates compiled by First
Call Corp. In a tough day of trading for most financial services
stocks, Citigroup's shares fell $1, or 1.4 percent, to $70.625 on
Monday, but still closed well above their 52-week low of $28.50.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's operating earnings, excluding a one-time gain of $74
million related to the reversal of a reorganization charge and a
one-time charge of $127 million for accounting changes, were $2.42
billion, up 12 percent from $2.16 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   That also represented a solid rebound from Citigroup's dismal
fourth quarter, when it posted operating earnings of $1.4 billion.
Revenue in the first quarter was $14.5 billion, up 15 percent from
$12.6 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup is one of the most far-flung financial services
companies overseas, and John Reed, the company's co-chief
executive, said in an interview that despite relatively calmer
financial conditions abroad, many countries ``want to grow and
they're being starved for capital.''
</P>
<P>
   He said most Latin American and Eastern European corporations
are fundamentally sound, while Asian borrowers, particularly South
Korean chaebols and state-owned enterprises in China, are still
larded with bad debt.
</P>
<P>
   But Reed also noted that much of the world is still in recession
or facing the threat of recession. ``The great risk is that the
U.S. economy is the only one that is doing well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Income from Citigroup's global consumer business, which includes
insurance banking and credit-card products, rose 33 percent, to
$1.05 billion. Income from the global corporate business, which
includes investment banking, brokerage services, commercial
lending, emerging markets and property and casualty insurance,
climbed 31 percent, to $1.36 billion. The asset management unit's
income rose 16 percent, to $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, Citigroup saw income from investment activities
drop 77 percent, to $93 million, on lower debt sales and
proprietary investment gains. Its net loss on e-Citi, a research
and development unit focused on electronic commerce, widened 20
percent, to $36 million, because of increased spending.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   BankAmerica, the second-biggest financial services concern in
the United States after Citigroup, also posted impressive
first-quarter results on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica, based in Charlotte, N.C., also the product of one
of last year's biggest mergers, said earnings in the quarter rose
44 percent, to $1.91 billion, or $1.08 a diluted share, from $1.33
billion, or 75 cents a share last year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected the bank to post earnings of $1.03 a
share. BankAmerica's shares, caught in the decline of financial
stocks, fell $1.25, or 1.7 percent, to $71.75, up from their
52-week low of $44.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica's results benefited from $500 million worth of
trading revenue, a figure the bank candidly noted was
``unsustainably high.'' Thomas Theurkauf, an analyst with Keefe,
Bruyette, said investors might have sold Citigroup and BankAmerica
shares Monday because trading played such a crucial role in their
earnings gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick for BankAmerica is to replace these more volatile
trading revenue with more core revenue growth during the rest of
the year,'' Theurkauf said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides trading, BankAmerica, which saw total revenue in the
quarter drop 4 percent, to $7.8 billion from $8.1 billion a year
ago, also attributed its improved profits to better expense
controls and strong loan growth matched by improved credit quality.
</P>
<P>
   The company's investment banking unit, Nationsbanc Montgomery
Securities, saw profits plunge 37 percent, to $388 million from
$613 million last year. But the bank said it expects a recovery in
that business, which was hammered by last fall's market downturn
and by a heavy exodus of employees from the division.

 &HT;    Glenn leads 2003 Committee into action
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ He wasn't sitting on a rocket, but John Glenn got
the crowd chanting ``Ten, nine, eight. . .'' Monday afternoon in
the U.S. Air Force Museum, where he helped the 2003 Committee
launch its campaign to celebrate the centennial anniversary of
powered flight.
</P>
<P>
   When the crowd of about 100 people got to ``zero,'' the space
pioneer flipped a switch that started the committee's digital
``countdown clock'' to Dec. 17, 2003, the 100th anniversary of the
Wright brothers' first flights in a powered airplane.
</P>
<P>
   It was Glenn's first public act as secretary general of the 2003
Committee, which also started operating under the new name
``Inventing Flight.''
</P>
<P>
   The event preceded an invitation-only gala at the museum, where
Inventing Flight officials offered the latest plans for a year-long
series of events to celebrate the first flight centennial.
</P>
<P>
   J. Bradford Tillson, chairman of Inventing Flight's board of
trustees, highlighted the main activities:
</P>
<P>
   Preparation of educational programs and materials, among them a
school curriculum plan dubbed ``From Kites to the Wrights'' and a
Digistar planetarium show.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of sports events, including bicycle races reminiscent
of the Wright brothers' days as bicycle makers.
</P>
<P>
   An international arts festival dedicated to conflict resolution,
starting with a week-long festival in May or June 2001, with the
aim of making it an annual event by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   A series of aviation-related events, culminating in what
Tillson, who is also publisher of the Dayton Daily News, called
``an air show for the ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said the 100th anniversary of powered flight deserves ``a
celebration of mammoth proportions'' because the airplane was a
revolutionary development that changed the world.
</P>
<P>
   And he said Dayton is an appropriate place to celebrate Orville
and Wilbur Wright's accomplishments: ``They lived, they worked and
they invented flight right here in Dayton.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn himself helped pioneer space flight in 1962 when he became
the first American to orbit the earth. Last October, he became the
oldest person to orbit the planet when he flew on a space shuttle
at age 77.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, whose titles have included Marine Corps colonel,
astronaut and U.S. senator, poked a little self-conscious fun at
his latest salutation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never a secretary and I never made general,'' he
quipped.
</P>
<P>
   The countdown clock is one of several that will be on display
around the Dayton area. The first will remain in the museum, with
others at Dayton International Airport and downtown.

 &HT;    Gore visits Ohio, visits tornado sites
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Vice President Al Gore helped his 2000 presidential
prospects during a visit to Cincinnati on Monday by winning
endorsements from U.S. Rep. Tony Hall and other Democrats and by
adding $150,000 in pledges to his campaign treasury.
</P>
<P>
   During his six-hour visit, Gore also visited Blue Ash and
Montgomery, Cincinnati suburbs hit by an April 9 tornado, and made
a vigorous defense of the air war being waged by the United States
and its NATO allies against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   It was the vice president's second visit to Ohio in less than a
week, pointing up the state's importance in next year's
presidential elections, Gore backers said. Last Wednesday, the vice
president, who once raised tobacco on his Tennessee farm, visited
Akron for an anti-smoking event.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 people attended a fund-raising luncheon at the downtown
Westin Cincinnati Hotel and either made contributions to Gore's
campaign or promised to raise funds. A campaign aide said the event
is expected to net at least $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's endorsement came at the luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the easiest endorsement I've ever made,'' said Hall,
D-Dayton, who served in the U.S. House with Gore. ``He's my friend
and I like him a lot. I think he's a good and decent man.''
</P>
<P>
   Little mention was made of President Clinton, whose tenure had
been tainted by his impeachment and related allegations of
misconduct. Hall's reference to Gore as a ``good and decent man''
was echoed by Cincinnati Mayor Roxanne Qualls in her endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has made it clear he is ``absolutely committed'' to his
wife, their three daughters and their son, Qualls said. Qualls also
announced that the Gores will become grandparents for the first
time in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a young man to be a grandfather, wouldn't you say?''
she asked. The vice president turned 51 on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   At the event, the Gore campaign also announced that the vice
president has been endorsed by state Sen. Mark Mallory, former U.S.
Rep. David Mann and other Cincinnati-area Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County Democratic Chairman Dennis Lieberman, who
attended the fund-raiser, said he personally has endorsed Gore but
the county party has not.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's extremely intelligent. If people take the time to listen
to him, he'll be elected,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who attended private schools as a boy, told supporters
that if he's elected he will make ``revolutionary changes in our
public schools.'' He said he wants to reduce class sizes so no
teacher _ in all grades up to the 12th _ has more than 20 students.
Also, Gore said he wants to make early childhood education
available to every child in the country who wants it
</P>
<P>
   Such changes are necessary to help the United States maintain
world leadership in an information age, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also urged the friendly crowd to back the
American and NATO war effort in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It confronted us with a situation where there were no good
options,'' he said. ``I'm proud we did respond.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he does not want the 21st century to be molded by
``thugs in ski masks with hatred in their hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Ohio and nationally have criticized Clinton and
Gore for raising money while the war rages, and that continued on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Clinton on the golf course and Gore on the road, you
wonder who is watching the store . . . It's shameless,'' said Gary
Abernathy, spokesman for the Ohio Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, however, said such charges are ``nothing more than
political accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that both Gore and Clinton have been willing to discuss
the war and the reasons for American involvement, as Gore did
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what he's doing is commendable, bringing it to the
people,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   During the visit to Blue Ash and Montgomery, Gore sympathized
with those cleaning up from the tornado that killed four people and
destroyed hundreds of homes.
</P>
<P>
   He was not able to tell them, however, that Gov. Bob Taft's
request for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency
for families, businesses and local governments had been approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is under intensive review right now at FEMA. There should
be some kind of word on that early this week,'' Gore said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Presenting herself as a New Yorker in spirit and in
politics, Hillary Rodham Clinton began a two-day tour through
Manhattan and Long Island on Monday, praising the state's history
and culture as she expounded for the first time on why she might
want to be the senator from a state she has never called home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love New York,'' she proclaimed. ``I always have.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of a rigorous 12-hour day of speeches, dinners,
photo sessions and a news conference, the first lady also strongly
assailed the idea of private school vouchers as a threat to the
nation's public education system. In so doing, Mrs. Clinton drew a
strong, though unstated, contrast to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is
also considering running for Senate, and has enthusiastically
embraced the idea of private school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, who will be spending three days in New York this
week, said that her visits were all part of official White House
business. As such, they are being financed almost entirely by
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mrs. Clinton kept to a schedule that would have been
considered heavy even for a declared candidate entering the final
week of a difficult contest. Her choice of stops was reminiscent of
a typical Democratic candidate's campaign itinerary, from an
environmental event in Central Park in the morning to a fund-raiser
for Rep. Jerrold Nadler, where she praised the Manhattan Democrat's
``vigor, intelligence and energy'' in defending her husband during
impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton seemed to take pains to reply to a criticism that
Giuliani has repeatedly raised about her potential candidacy: that
if she ran, she would be a political opportunist, because she has
never lived in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton declared her affection for the state, instructing a
roomful of reporters about the diversity of the state's
agricultural crops and, by using the word ``we'' in discussing the
state, all but implying that she was a New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is truly a microcosm of America,'' she said, adding
that it had ``everything from our biggest, most dynamic city to
rural areas that produce some of the crops that you might be
surprised to know are actually grown right here in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So we have everything in New York that we have in America,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who grew up in Illinois, recounted her frequent
visits to New York as first lady, and said that she felt
politically comfortable in the state. She suggested that
representing New York would allow her to work on issues she had
hoped to tackle as first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way that New York handles a lot of issues, and the
challenges that are going to be facing America in the next century,
are ones that are of deep interest to me,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``So
in my many visits to New York, I have always been very excited by
the dynamism of the people here and the real cutting-edge approach
to a lot of what I consider to be the important issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's trip marked another chapter in what has become
a very active if not-quite-declared campaign between two
not-quite-declared candidates to succeed Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, the Democrat who is retiring next year. For all the
tentativeness of Mrs. Clinton's intentions, her mere arrival drew a
huge press contingent, including eight television cameras and a
pack of reporters from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In this campaign netherworld, Mrs. Clinton and her staff seemed
unsure whether she was a potential candidate or just a first lady.
They seemed flummoxed by questions about the appropriateness of
taxpayers financing the trip; the first lady's press secretary,
Marsha Berry, wearily suggested that a reporter who pressed her on
who was paying for the travel was ``a pinhead,'' though she said
that the first lady would address the question if and when her
candidacy became more concrete.
</P>
<P>
   While the schedule seemed designed to encourage press attention,
the first lady declined to provide routine transportation for her
sizable press corps, apparently concerned that such a gesture might
undercut her portrayal of the trip as business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was anything but tentative in his treatment of a
Democrat who even his aides acknowledge would be a formidable
rival. Outside of New York City, ``I do note, as I travel around
the state, a very strong reaction against her running,'' he said.
``I have people coming up to me, saying to me, and not just
Republicans, `Why don't you go run in Arkansas?' ''
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized Clinton's handling of Kosovo. ``From the very
beginning, this should have been thought out better and the purpose
should have been stated better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday marked the first time that the first lady had publicly
discussed a Senate race, at least on American soil. (She had
answered questions about it during a visit to Cairo.) The first
lady did nothing to discourage the speculation; her remarks, in
fact, suggested that she is exploring ways to deal with problems
she might confront as someone who does not live in New York.

<P>
   &UR; REFUGEES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ The flow of Kosovo Albanians into Albania and Macedonia dried

Russian troops in an international force in Kosovo. It was their
first conversation on the conflict since the bombing began on March
24.
</P>
<P>
   _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he would visit Moscow
on April 29 to discuss the Kosovo crisis.

OBSTACLES REMAIN IN L.A. BID FOR NFL TEAM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One thing is clear in this city's pursuit of a
National Football League expansion team _ it won't use tax dollars
to build the kind of stadium the NFL demands.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the only thing that's clear.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL picture here remains as hazy as the smog hanging over
the only U.S. city to lose two professional football teams in the
same year.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are there no plans to use tax dollars _ which the NFL
wanted _ but there are no plans for a state-of-the-art stadium.
There is no clear-cut location for it. There is no ownership group
with enough support from league owners to get the 24 votes needed
to join their elite club.
</P>
<P>
   To sort out some of the confusion, NFL officials flew here for
meetings Monday and Tuesday with business, civic and political
leaders to get a sharper image of what must occur to meet the
league's Sept. 15 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   If the answers aren't found by then, it is very likely Houston
and businessman Bob McNair will be get the league's 32nd franchise.
They have what Los Angeles doesn't: a ready-to-go $310 million
stadium deal backed by $195 million in local tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very confusing situation here,'' NFL Expansion
Committee Co-Chairman Jerry Richardson said in the Century Plaza
Hotel, where NFL officials are meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, owner of the Carolina Panthers, said that despite
the confusion he thinks Los Angeles can take a major step toward
getting pro football for the first time since the Raiders and Rams
left in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Richardson and other NFL officials attended a
cocktail party held by the Los Angeles Business Advisers, a group
of top business executives. Today, the owners will tour the
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we met in Phoenix last month, Los Angeles was standing
still,'' Richardson said. ``But in the last month, we have gotten
overwhelming support from almost everyone in the community. Every
business leader, religious leader, academic leader and political
leader seem to have a genuine interest to do what they can to get a
team.''
</P>
<P>
   What they have not done, however, is put together a solid deal.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the league has list of general goals the city
must meet, including a better understanding of how much parking a
Los Angeles deal can include and, specifically, who will pay for
it.
</P>
<P>
   If the owners agree to let a renovated Coliseum become the
stadium for the next team, they want assurances there is enough
parking close so fans don't have to walk through the rowdy
neighborhood around it.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson also said there are issues about control of the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But utmost among the goals is creating a situation here where
the league can up the ante for an expansion fee by pitting
ownership bidders against one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Owners don't want to be dictated to about who the Los Angeles
owner will be,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   That creates a dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Developer Ed Roski holds the right to make a new stadium out of
the old Coliseum. Though someone can buy that right from him _ for
the $5 million in costs he has incurred to date _ no one seems
willing to do it
</P>
<P>
   because it would also shoulder aside his partner, Eli Broad, one
of the most politically connected people in the city.
</P>
<P>
   A series of events unfolded last week that could lead to a
bidding war in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   First, Richardson bluntly told the Los Angeles Times that he
wanted Roski's deal terminated by the time NFL owners meet this
week.
</P>
<P>
   That coincided with an announcement by Hollywood deal-maker
Michael Ovitz that he was backing out of a competing proposal to
build a new stadium, called The Hacienda, atop a former landfill in
nearby Carson.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz said he would focus on the Coliseum project.
</P>
<P>
   But representatives for both Broad-Roski and Ovitz have said
they will not share control with each other. It's a winner-take-all
game.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And the game has a wild card, pushed by the NFL and supported by
Ovitz _ move the Los Angeles Dodgers from Chavez Ravine to a new
stadium next to the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were bought last year by Rupert Murdoch, who also
owns Fox Sports _ which televises NFL games. Last week, team
officials scoffed at the suggestion, saying they are working on a
$30 million to $50 million renovation of Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox officials have not dismissed the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion means little news is likely to come out of the
meetings, which will end with a Coliseum press conference attended
by Mayor Richard Riordan and City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   All this means is that Los Angeles has less than five months to
work out a deal it has been unable to cobble together for more than
a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't done much so far,'' said one NFL official.
</P>

YVETTE PIERPAOLI, 60, AID WORKER WHO DEVOTED LIFE TO REFUGEES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yvette Pierpaoli, a dynamic French woman who traveled the world
seeking to help war widows, displaced persons, land-mine victims,
homeless families, street children and other refugees, was one of
three aid workers killed on Sunday in an automobile accident near
Kukes, Albania. She was 60.
</P>
<P>
   As a European representative of Refugees International, an aid
organization, Ms. Pierpaoli had been making trips to the Balkans
since last June, when she saw some of the first refugees fleeing
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a legend in the international refugee community,''
said Richard Holbrooke, chairman of Refugees International,
President Clinton's nominee for chief American delegate to the
United Nations and a special envoy to the Balkans. ``A small woman
of incredible strength and enthusiasm, she carried people along
with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pierpaoli's efforts to help people began when she was 19 and
left France for Cambodia to operate an import-export business
there. She undertook aid missions to many countries in Asia, Africa
and Latin America, including Thailand, Cambodia, Mali and Niger.
</P>
<P>
   She was forced to leave Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge came to
power in 1975, and she retired between travels to a stone house in
the village of Serviers in the south of France.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, she founded Tomorrow, a nonprofit foundation that
provided seed money for development projects and emergency
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   One of her special interests was the plight of Tuareg refugees
in the Sahara desert of Mali and Niger. During many visits to these
countries, she helped to develop projects for irrigation and
raising livestock.
</P>
<P>
   She was a co-founder of Info Birmanie, a European human rights
organization focused on Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pierpaoli was well known in France, partly through her 1992
autobiography, ``Woman of a Thousand Children'' (Robert Laffont,
Paris).
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a daughter, Emanuel, who lives in the New
York City area, and a son, Oliver, who lives in Paris.

U.S. NOT SEEKING EXTRADITION IN KILLING OF REPORTER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Officials at the U.S. Justice Department said Monday
that they would not ask the Colombian government to extradite a
prisoner suspected of plotting the 1992 murder of a journalist in
Queens County.
</P>
<P>
   Guillermo Leon Restrepo Gaviria, a former leader of the Cali
drug cartel who was arrested Saturday in Colombia, is wanted in the
United States for helping to plan the killing of Manuel de Dios
Unanue, who had written several exposes about drug trafficking for
two Spanish-language magazines in New York.
</P>
<P>
   De Dios, 48, was shot to death in 1992 while dining at a
restaurant in Elmhurst, N.Y. Six people in the United States have
been convicted in the murder. The gunman, Alejandro Mejia Velez,
was 17 when he shot de Dios.
</P>
<P>
   Restrepo is the last person wanted by U.S. officials in
connection with the murder. Investigators accused him of making
calls to contacts in New York to order the killing with an offer of
$50,000. Investigators also accuse Restrepo of ordering the murders
of witnesses' relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the decision not to extradite Restrepo, John
Russell, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said that the
extradition treaty that the United States negotiated with Colombia
in 1997 is not retroactive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The treaty does not apply to Restrepo,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian officials said that Restrepo has been charged with
illegal enrichment and remains in custody in Bogota, where he faces
4 to 12 years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and friends of de Dios said such a penalty would be
too light. Victoria Sanchez, the mother of his 9-year-old daughter,
challenged the Justice Department's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the extradition treaty may not apply to this case,''
she said, ``but if the Justice Department really wanted to, they
could extradite Restrepo. I guess they don't feel Restrepo is big
enough of a fish for them to really pressure the Colombian
government.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from her home in Puerto Rico, Ms.
Sanchez added, ``Even though the Colombian government may want to
apply justice, it is very hard for them. But the United States
makes people pay for their crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Restrepo's arrest in Medellin sparked intense debate over U.S.
extradition policies among Hispanic journalists in New York. Some
repeated Ms. Sanchez's argument that justice systems in many Latin
American countries are rife with corruption and lack the political
strength to impose strong punishments on drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   But others said that de Dios probably would have supported the
U.S. Justice Department's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manuel was vehemently opposed to the extradition efforts by
the United States, because he felt they violated the sovereignty of
other nations,'' said Rossana Rosado, the editor-in-chief of El
Diario La Prensa. ``He was bitterly criticized for those views.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosado, whose newspaper is the largest Spanish-language
daily in New York, considers herself one of de Dios' protegees. She
was the metropolitan editor of El Diario when de Dios was the
editor in chief.
</P>
<P>
   She said she planned to write about de Dios' feelings on
extradition in tomorrow's issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one hand, of course I want to see Restrepo extradited so
that he can be punished for putting a contract on Manuel's life,''
she said. ``But on the other hand, I must remind people that Manuel
was vehemently opposed to extradition, and we can't conveniently
ignore his beliefs.''

LIMITS PLANNED ON BUILDING HEIGHTS IN NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Moving to overhaul New York City's zoning laws for
the first time in 40 years, the Giuliani administration on Tuesday
will propose the city's first broad limits on the height of
skyscrapers. The rules would curtail a longstanding practice that
permits developers to build higher buildings in exchange for
creating plazas or other public amenities at ground level.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are among several in the planned zoning revisions.
Some changes would open manufacturing areas to more medical and
social service complexes. Others would greatly increase the number
of parking spaces allowed in new residential buildings and impose
more restrictions on the large billboard-type signs that are common
across the city.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most significant changes involve building size,
with the new proposals aimed at setting maximum heights for
buildings in most parts of a city that is synonymous with its
skyscrapers. City officials say the height limits have yet to be
determined, but added that the permissible height of new buildings
would probably be similar to that of the tallest existing structure
in any particular neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The most congested parts of midtown and downtown would be
excluded from the new height rules, Joseph Rose, the chairman of
the City Planning Commission, said in an interview. The idea, Rose
explained, is not to protect those two most densely developed parts
of Manhattan from more dense development, but to prevent other
areas of the city from being overdeveloped.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed restrictions are intended to address the challenges
posed by a strong economy and a resulting building boom that has
tested limits on the height and scale of new construction.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Donald Trump is proceeding with plans for a
90-story apartment building on a residential East Side block, a
project he has been able to push by obtaining development rights
from several nearby properties.
</P>
<P>
   The Trump plan would have been blocked if the proposed zoning
changes had been in effect when it was awaiting city approval, Rose
said. He would not give other examples of buildings, either
existing or proposed, that would be disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the existing rules that allowed for such projects
cumbersome and obsolete, city officials say developers should no
longer be allowed to exploit such development rights _ and use
outdated city incentives _ to build ever-higher towers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they said, the city should find ways to
accommodate projects that meet the needs of its growing economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a city that has been built to its borders, but is
still growing and changing as rapidly as any other,'' said Rose,
who is scheduled to describe the proposed zoning changes to an
invited group of planners, community advocates and elective
officials in a City Hall address Tuesday. He said the height limits
would vary according to the existing scale of city neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the city's complex 900-page zoning law that was
first written in 1916 and last amended in 1961, Rose said he feared
what he called ``a Pandora's box'' of conflicting demands from
developers, environmentalists and others if the entire zoning
statute were opened for revision.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, he said, was to institute a limited number of
``dramatic modifications.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes face a battery of tests, including public
hearings, environmental review and a City Council vote. The
administration hopes to have the rules in place by the time
Giuliani leaves office; the last time such major changes were
proposed, in the 1950s, the revisions were not enacted for nearly a
decade.

 &HT;    Elite U.S. paratroopers land in Albania, raising spectre of
ground troops
 &HT;    (EDS: CORRECTS and clarifies datelines.)
 &HT;    By Joseph Albright at RINAS AIR FIELD, Albania
 &HT;    and Scott Shepard in WASHINGTON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hundreds of battle-ready ground troops of the elite 82nd
Airborne Division departed American shores Monday night for Albania
to conduct ``infantry-type missions'' against Yugoslav forces in
Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 members of the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment were
airlifted from the airborne division's headquarters at Fort Bragg,
N.C., as part of ``Task Force Hawk,'' the deployment of 24 Apache
attack helicopters and land-based missiles for use against Serbian
tanks and soldiers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The principle mission of the paratroopers is to provide security
for the basing of Apaches near the Kosovo border. Members of the
82nd Airborne performed a similar role as peacekeepers in Bosnia in
1996, providing security at an air base in Tuzla.
</P>
<P>
   But the statement issued Monday by an Army spokesman at Fort
Bragg announcing the departure of the paratroopers raised further
questions about whether NATO is moving closer to a ground war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our paratroopers will perform a variety of infantry-type
missions, including security,'' said Bob Coultas, spokesman for the
18th Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg. Spokesmen for the 82nd Airborne
Division declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 NATO troops are already in Albania, and Pentagon
officials have indicated that as many as 2,000 more airborne troops
could be sent there as part of Task Force Hawk. Another 6,000
ground troops are expected to help with the humanitarian relief
mission for Kosovar refugees in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are about 12,000 NATO troops in Macedonia,
including about 600 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana has repeatedly emphasized
that NATO has no plans to authorize a ground invasion of Kosovo.
But on Sunday, he significantly added to the ongoing ground troop
dialogue. ``If the moment comes when it is necessary (to invade
Yugoslavia), I'm sure the countries that belong to NATO will be
ready to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lead units of the 82nd Airborne Division arrived here Sunday
after a nine-hour flight on an Air Force transport from Fort Bragg.
They began moving out of their overnight quarters on this airfield
Monday, departing in camouflaged Humvees to points unknown along
Albania's frontier border with Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel motivated being here,'' said Army PFC Sam Cruce, 21, of
Gainesville, Ga., one of the first arrivals. ``It's pretty cool. I
never expected to be deployed out here.''
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to talk about their mission here, a squad leader,
2d Lt. Ryan Leigh, 23, of St. Cloud, Minn., said: ``It's a good
mission for America. And I am happy to be here, I'm proud to be
here. We are doing the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how many troops of the 82d were on their way to
Albania, a captain answered with two words: ``A bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon on Monday, Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald said
the Apache helicopters would arrive in Albania on Tuesday, unless
weather interferes.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., returned to Washington after a weekend
trip to the Balkans and warned Monday that it would be ``many
weeks'' and ``perhaps months'' before the Apache helicopters would
be a major factor in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's looking for a silver bullet,'' said Levin, a
member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He briefed
reporters, he said, in an effort to lower public expectations for
the helicopters, which are expected to begin flying missions in
about a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilots have to become accustomed to the terrain,'' Levin
said, adding that the complex support and defense preparations,
which include putting spotters on the ground to guide pilots to
potential targets, are a long way from completion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Apaches must proceed on a gradual basis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 82nd Airborne Division was formed in 1917 at Camp Gordon,
Ga. Because members of the division came from all 48 states,
including Sgt. Alvin York of Tennessee, the unit was nicknamed
``All-Americans'' that led to its famed ``AA'' shoulder patch.
</P>
<P>
   The division led the assault at Normandy Beach in D-Day in World
War II. Following the surrender of Germany, it was ordered to
Berlin for occupation duty.
</P>
<P>
   The division was called to action during the Tet Offensive in
Vietnam in 1968, in Grenada in 1983, as part of ``Just Cause'' to
arrest Panama strongman Manuel Noriega in 1989 and the liberation
of Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   As the 82d Airborne troops were getting organized by the taxiway
here Monday, an American mobile artillery unit from Germany rolled
out the airfield gates in the general direction of the
Albania-Kosovo border.
</P>
<P>
   The artillery troops were armed with truck-borne multiple rocket
launchers designed to fire tactical ATACM missiles, nicknamed
``Attack-Ems,'' at targets 60 miles away or further. The missiles
arrived here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As the American artillery unit passed along the potholed, narrow
roads leading northward, Albanians watched by the side of the road
with delight and wonderment. ``This is very lucky for all
Albanians,'' said Simon Goni, 58, owner of a roadside cafe. ``The
Americans are our guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday was also a day of considerable jubilation at the
headquarters of the Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA, in the capital
Tirana, where members of the guerrilla organization were issuing
KLA press credentials to journalists for use in territory inside
Kosovo after it has been ``liberated'' from the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the U.S. Army will stay forever in Kosovo,'' said Visar
Reka, a KLA spokesmen. ``I wish America would make it the 51st
state.''

STOCK MARKET HIT AS INVESTORS FLEE TECHNOLOGY AREA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout)   (mb) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON and    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a stunning reversal, investors piled out of
technology stocks and other market darlings on Monday, pummeling
the very shares that propelled the broad market averages to records
last week.
</P>
<P>
   After rising 271.8 points, or 2.6 percent, during the morning,
the Dow Jones industrial average ran out of steam shortly after
noon and ended the day down 53.36 points, or 0.5 percent, at
10,440.53.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq market started the day in negative territory and
never climbed out as investors fled the computer, Internet and
telecommunications stocks they had been favoring. Amazon.com lost
16 percent, Dell Computer declined 7.3 percent, and Microsoft fell
6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, home to most of the nation's
technology companies, fell 138.43 points, or about 5.6 percent, to
close at 2,345.61.
</P>
<P>
   That was the composite's second- biggest fall in points but only
its seventh in percentage terms. Its largest point decline took
place on Aug. 31, at the height of the Russian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange exceeded 1.21 billion
shares, the second-heaviest trading day in the exchange's history.
Nasdaq trading volume was also brisk, at 1.198 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, investors took refuge in stocks whose fortunes
closely track the performance of the economy, but even those shares
began to sputter at the close. ``This kind of a sharp and dramatic
reversal is not just business as usual,'' said Byron R. Wien, U.S.
investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``There's a
message here. The message is everything finally began to sell off
from sheer exhaustion.''
</P>
<P>
   Though oil prices rose in the morning, traders said this alone
was not enough to kill the rally in the Dow. The shift away from
the glamour stocks of technology, health care, Internet and
telecommunications companies began last week and it simply gained
momentum. The Standard &AMP; Poor's/Barra Growth stock index _ a
collection of companies with high growth rates and lofty stock
valuations _ has fallen 10 percent in the last five trading
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest losers on Monday were stocks that had
previously seemed to levitate. Even after Monday's collapse, these
shares are trading at high prices based on their earnings and are
well above their lows. America Online, for example, fell 23~ a
share, to 115~. That is down more than 30 percent from its high of
April 6, but the shares are now where they were just about a month
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Charles Schwab Corp., a brokerage concern that is
a favorite Internet play because of its on-line trading services,
closed down 32 percent from its high of one week ago. Still, it is
up 81 percent since the start of the year. Reflecting the damage
done to Internet stocks, the American Stock Exchange's Internet
index is down 18 percent from its high set last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Proving once again that the market's leadership can change on a
dime, investors last week began to realize that excessive
valuations in stocks posed more risk than they could comfortably
accept. Rather than flee stocks entirely, they shifted to shares of
some companies that had been left for dead. Previously unglamorous
companies such as Allied Signal, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing
and Smurfit-Stone Container registered impressive gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors had the idea that it's a new economy and a new stock
market and that meant you don't have to worry about the old rules
of diversification and quality,'' said Alan F. Skrainka, chief
market strageist at Edward Jones in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   No longer.
</P>
<P>
   The move away from growth stocks with high valuations and into
companies that are viewed as cheaper began last week. Market
strategists pointed to two events that gave investors pause. The
first was the European Central Bank's move on April 8 to cut
interest rates, a signal that policy makers are committed to
keeping the world on a path to economic growth by jumpstarting
Europe's economies.
</P>
<P>
   When economic growth around the world is scarce, as it has been
recently, investors retreat to stocks they know can produce good
earnings in spite of any malaise _ these are shares with hefty and
reliable profits, so-called growth stocks. Indeed, these investors
are willing to pay premiums for these profits. But when growth is
plentiful, a broader group of companies benefits and investors can
find improving profits in less expensive stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The second scare for growth-stock investors came last Monday
when Compaq Computer warned that its quarterly earnings would be
half what analysts had been expecting. This reminded traders that
technology, for all its promise, can also disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to investor concern about growth stocks in general, and
technology stocks in particular, was the news on Friday that Robert
Stansky, the manager of Fidelity Investments' Magellan fund, had
sold large positions in many hot technology stocks that had been
among his biggest holdings. Stansky moved into ``value stocks,''
more mundane shares that were trading at lower premiums to their
earnings growth rates.
</P>
<P>
   Traders noted on Monday that there were so few buyers for many
falling stocks that sellers could get out only if they accepted
prices well below the prevailing market. Some fell sharply even
though relatively few shares exchanged hands.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Companies waiting in the wings to offer their shares to the
public for the first time were likely losers in Monday's market
decline as well. Three Internet concerns, Net Perceptions Inc.,
Proxicom Inc. and Launch Media Inc., had planned initial public
offerings this week. Until investors become more hospitable to
companies like these, such offerings are likely to remain on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists pointed to the effect that hordes of rapid-fire day
traders _ many of whom are relative newcomers to stocks and have
yet to experience a severe, protracted decline in stock prices _
could have on the market. In recent months, these traders have
created momentum and profits as they piled into stocks. If they are
now piling out, they may create tidal waves of selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case where a lot of these stocks have some
unreasonable gains,'' said Laszlo Birinyi, who heads his own stock
research firm in Greenwich, Conn. ``Now people are starting to lock
in the gains when they can. As these stocks decline from their
highs, the movement feeds on itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime traders worry that a flood of calls from brokerage
firms will go out to stock investors on Tuesday for more funds to
prop up diminished portfolios that they have borrowed against to
buy more stocks. Customers must meet these requests, known as
margin calls, with fresh money or with cash raised by selling
stocks. If shares are sold, the market decline could accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Ameritrade, a large discount brokerage firm,
said that it had slightly higher margin calls than normal, adding
that it had no discernible problems with trading. She also said
that the brokerage firm had previously imposed higher borrowing
limits, presumably lessening the number of margin calls that would
go out to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, investors could jump back into their former stock
darlings if they judge the selling to be overdone. Such a strategy
has served them well in the last five years and was especially
shrewd when the market rebounded from its correction in October.
Microsoft, for example announces its earnings on Monday. Investors
may like what they see and bid the stock back up again.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wien of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said that the United
States stock market remains overvalued and that the broad market
averages will experience a correction, defined by traders as a
decline of 20 percent. ``What you're seeing is a resolution of
excessive valuation in the market. I expect the indexes to decline
further, but I don't think we're in a bear market.''

BRAZIL BOUNCES BACK, OFFERING $1 BILLION IN DEBT FOR SALE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Brazil devalued its currency in January, the nation was
faced with rising inflation, soaring interest rates, the threat of
default and a recession. Most foreign investors crossed Brazil off
their dance cards.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Brazil is offering $1 billion in five-year
notes for sale this week to global investors.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians' remarkable turnaround, which caught many
investors by surprise, is a reminder of how fast things can change
in volatile emerging markets. The planned sale is also a tribute to
the skill of the new head of Brazil's central bank, Arminio Fraga,
who took over in February and helped produce the sharp drop in
interest rates and the rally in Brazil's currency that has made a
return to the global capital markets possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty amazing,'' said David Sekiguchi, head of Latin
American Strategy at J.P. Morgan Securities. ``Brazil beat the most
optimistic expectation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not yet clear how strong the demand for the new
debt issue will be, the talk Monday in the corporate bond market
was positive. Early indications, though, are that prospective
investors want to be offered a premium over current yields on
existing Brazilian bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the closest maturity to the new debt _ the Brazilian
note due in 2008 _ was trading at a yield of 11.58 percent, or
almost 6.5 percentage points over the comparable U.S. States
Treasury obligation. Given that a five-year note would have a
slightly lower yield, a spread over the five-year Treasury note of
more than six percentage points would seem to provide the premium
that many investors want. That would put the yield just under 12
percent, which is high but well below where Brazilian interest
rates were at the end of February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are comfortable with the credit,'' said Barbara Kenworthy,
portfolio manager at Prudential mutual funds. But, she added, ``we
want to see if this will come at yields higher than outstanding
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of the issue is important in several ways. For one
thing, the government wants to prove to domestic investors that
foreign buyers are again interested in Brazil. Such a show of
foreign support would help lower the cost of Brazil's domestic
borrowing, which is one of the government's biggest burdens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a way to signal to the local market that the foreign
market is there once again for Brazil,'' said Jose Barrionuevo,
director of global market strategy at Lehman Brothers. ``It makes
local investors more confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Another purpose is to set up a benchmark for other Brazilian
debt. A successful sale of this government note would make it
easier for Brazilian corporations to come to market.
</P>
<P>
   The debt issue, which is being led by underwriters from Salomon
Smith Barney, a part of Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
offers investors a choice in how to buy the new five-year notes.
They can pay cash or they can exchange existing shorter-term Brady
bond issues. For Brazil, the exchange would retire some
higher-yielding debt. For example, the so-called IDU issue that
matures in 2001 was yielding about seven percentage points over
comparable Treasuries Monday, higher than the spread investors may
get on the new bond.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Swanson, portfolio manager of the Strategic Income Fund at
MFS in Boston, said he was considering buying the new five-year
notes because he thinks Brazil is ``an improving story.'' But he
said he would probably not exchange the eligible Brady bonds
because they offered a better yield.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians, according to Michael Corbat, head of Latin
American debt origination and emerging-market sales at Salomon
Smith Barney, will have a lunch in New York Wednesday for investors
where Fraga will speak. There will also be an investor conference
call and a separate meeting in Boston. The cash sale will be priced
on Thursday, and then the exchange will be set on Friday, based on
the cash price.
</P>
<P>
   There are many signs of improvement in the outlook for Brazil,
although the economy is not out of the woods. Official interest
rates were cut to 34 percent last week, the third reduction since
Fraga took over. The interest rate on Brazil's bond due in 2027
fell to 12.45 percent Monday from a high of 18.7 percent in
January. Stocks have rallied sharply, even in dollar terms. And the
nation's currency, the real, has rallied back to an exchange rate
of 1.6775 to the dollar. That is still down 28 percent from its
rate before devaluation, but it is a nice rebound from the 44
percent plunge at the currency's low point early in March.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the bond sale Monday gave an immediate boost
to Brazilian foreign debt, with many issues rallying. But by the
end of the day, many of those had given up their gains and were
down somewhat. Traders suggested that some selling may have come in
the wake of a selloff in United States stocks.

CARDS TAKE TWO IN FIRST _ BUT CAN THEY SIGN THEM? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Cardinals top draft pick David Boston guaranteed
Monday he wouldn't be a holdout.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad wouldn't let me hold out,'' said Boston, of his father,
Byron, an NFL game official.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, the Ohio State wide receiver picked eighth overall,
didn't put his pledge in writing.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Michigan offensive tackle Lonnie Shelton, the team's
other first-round pick, also said he planned on being signed before
the July 30 opening of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   History isn't on their side. Two of the team's last three
first-round picks _ Defensive ends Simeon Rice and Andre Wadsworth
_ missed all of camp and didn't sign until right before the start
of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   There are indications, however, this year will be different for
the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Team Vice President Bill Bidwill Jr. talked to Boston and
Shelton and their agents about their chances of holding out before
drafting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're going to have problems signing those
guys,'' Bidwill Jr. said. ``Both of those kids expressed desire to
be in on time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have had success getting players signed on time
when they don't have a pick in the top five of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, cornerback Tom Knight was picked ninth overall
and signed before training camp opened. In fact, the Cardinals were
one of the first teams to have all of their players signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knight wanted to be in on time and got in on time and got a
fair deal,'' Bidwill Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   Also helping the Cardinals' chances of getting the players
signed before the start of camp is that Kentucky quarterback Tim
Couch, the first overall pick, already has agreed to terms with
Cleveland on a seven-year, $48 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   Couch and the Browns reached agreement before the draft, the
first time that has happened in the NFL since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, hurting Wadsworth's negotiations with the Cardinals is
that last year's No. 1 pick, Tennessee quarterback Peyton Manning,
didn't even start negotiating with Indianapolis until mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably will affect the first three picks because all are
quarterbacks,'' said Boston's agent Mitch Frankel, who accompanied
him to Tempe Monday for a news conference to introduce the top
picks.
</P>
<P>
   There could be a trickle-down effect. With Couch signed, other
players picked in the top 10 might start negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Torry Holt will get done pretty quickly because St.
Louis is reasonable and is motivated to get him into camp as soon
as possible,'' said Frankel of the North Carolina State wide
receiver drafted sixth overall by the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel's last No. 1 pick, Miami of Florida defensive end Kenny
Holmes, was in Tennessee's training camp on time two years ago. But
the previous year, another of his clients, controversial running
back Lawrence Phillips of Nebraska, was late for the Rams' camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a unique situation,'' Frankel said of a complicated
contract in which Phillips' contract was tied to him staying out of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel said he didn't have a problem with Bidwill Jr. asking
pre-draft questions about the team's ability to sign Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made it clear to us that he didn't want to see a holdout
and said, `Do you forsee that happening?' '' Frankel said. ``We
told him we don't want that to happen, and I would have asked the
same question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always prided myself on being reasonable. . . . As long
as the Cardinals (are) the same way, I don't forsee any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, taken 21st overall, likely can't afford to be a holdout
if he wants to compete for the starting left tackle job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts an offensive lineman more than any other position to
miss training camp,'' Bidwill Jr. said. ``Look at what happened to
Orlando Pace (of the Rams) two years ago. There are tons of
examples.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton's agent, Lamont Smith, who also represented former
Cardinals offensive tackle Lomas Brown, said he understands how
important it is for rookie offensive linemen to be in camp on time.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, his client, offensive tackle Tra Thomas of Florida
State, picked 11th overall by the Eagles, signed well before camp
opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to get tackles in on time because of the
cohesiveness of the offensive line,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Also helping the Cardinals' negotiating position with Shelton is
that Oakland and the New York Giants drafted offensive tackles 18th
and 19th overall, respectively. As a result, Shelton's contract
will be slotted after those tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said when he talked to the Cardinals before the draft,
they inquired about ``taking certain things off the negotiating
table. We took the positon that we thought we could get (the deal)
done, but we didn't want to take the things off the table.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the player picked 21st overall, wide receiver Randy
Moss of Minnesota, received a signing bonus of $2 million and an
average salary of $1.092.5 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth-pick overall, defensive end Greg Ellis of North
Carolina, received a six-year, $11.5 million deal, including a $5.4
million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Contracts are expected to increase 8 percent from a year ago. &QL;

IN CONGO OR KOSOVO, A COMPULSION TO HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They tell each other it's because of the ``3Ms'' _ in
other words, they're convinced they have the characteristics of
martyrs, misfits and masochists. They see each other at the world's
most horrific disasters. They dig wells, rehydrate children with
intravenous fluid and live on adrenaline. Kosovo (and Rwanda and
Uganda and Congo) are how they make their living.
</P>
<P>
   So when Gerald Martone, a registered nurse, was talking to
refugees over the weekend in northern Albania, he wasn't all that
stunned when a fellow rescue worker ran up behind him and engulfed
him in a bear hug. ``And you try to remember, where did I last see
him?'' Martone said Monday by phone from Tirana. ``Was that
Liberia? Was that Sierra Leone?''
</P>
<P>
   Martone, who considers himself a masochist and a martyr but not
a misfit, is the emergency response director of the International
Rescue Committee, the world's largest nonsectarian refugee agency.
The committee was Albert Einstein's idea, to help people escape
from the Nazis; the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr helped found it.
</P>
<P>
   When things are calm, Martone lives in the Murray Hill section
of Manhattan and works out of the committee's headquarters there,
where he fidgeted through an interview two weeks ago. (Too much to
do, and he wanted to get to Albania.) When things are not calm, and
they usually aren't, Martone, 42, is in a satisfied frenzy, a
leader of a band of people who move from crisis to international
crisis. Right now Kosovo is the center of his world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm compelled by it,'' Martone said. ``For the lay person who
sees these images of Kosovo, it must evoke tremendous frustration
and a sense of guilt. For me, I just see, `Wow, we can make a
difference here.' I know what to do in this situation. People don't
have to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Martone has worked in a dozen war zones over the past 20 years,
and becomes excited about things like latrines. In fact, a snapshot
of one he built in Congo hangs on his office wall. ``Best thing in
the world to do to save lives,'' he said. ``Very unphotogenic.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has learned how quickly latrines can turn around a
cholera outbreak, like the one he saw in the Goma region of Zaire
in August 1994, when 2,000 people were dying each day. ``I remember
walking along with people pulling at your pants, saying, `Help
me,''' Martone said.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing Martone has seen in Albania is as bad, which does
nothing to diminish the horror stories from refugees who have
flooded across the border. He has heard of children who suffocated
in the packed trucks and trailers, and has seen pictures they've
drawn of their burning homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a horrible story of one family who had their injured
father hidden under a pile of clothing, with a kind of snorkel for
air,'' Martone said. ``It took so long to get to the checkpoint
that by the time they finally did pass through, they unburied him
and he had died.''
</P>
<P>
   Martone arrived in Tirana late last week to oversee his staff of
150, locals and expatriates, who are building dormitory-style
housing for refugees in towns throughout Albania. He lives in an
apartment with friends, but spends most of his time at the office,
a couple of fifth-floor rooms in a back alley of Tirana. The
weather is wet and cold, yet his spirits are good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on a bit of a high, I guess,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What turns someone into a 20-year relief worker? Martone said
that for him, it was his father, who designed uniforms for the Army
and who went to Vietnam when Martone was 10. ``I think he managed
logistics or something,'' Martone said. The elder Martone sent back
Super-8 film of primitive living conditions, which made an
impression on his son. ``I was appalled at the disparity,'' Martone
said.
</P>
<P>
   Right after graduating from the University of Massachusetts at
Lowell, in 1979, Martone went into the Peace Corps, to Liberia,
where he built latrines and worked in a clinic. Five months after
arriving, he was held up at gunpoint in a coup, thrown into the
back of a truck, then driven around a chaotic Monrovia, the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Martone can still remember the bloodshot eyes of his captors.
``It was the most frightening thing that's ever happened to me,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martone was eventually freed, and got right back on the horse _
if anything, the incident propelled him with even more purpose into
dangerous relief work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freud would say it's repetition compulsion, that people feel
compelled to repeat powerful emotional experiences,'' Martone said.
He passed up medical school _ he says his parents think he's ``a
little quirky'' _ and decided to become a nurse. ``In the Peace
Corps, I saw what nurses were able to do,'' Martone said. ``It was
nothing less than dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Martone is divorced (a sign in his office says ``Get a Life
Gerry''), and has a 7-year-old son who lives in Boston. He also has
a specialty in clinical hypnosis and is, in fact, a compelling and
slightly hypnotic personality. He does excellent magic tricks, like
taking out the little ball in his computer mouse and making it
disappear if you ask.
</P>
<P>
   He is clear-eyed about the impact of his work: ``A lot of people
reflect back on the futility of it, that we're making such a small
dent in such an enormous problem,'' he said. ``That's why so many
people in this field find one person they can grab on to, the one
refugee child who they go and bring an apple to. You measure your
success in very small increments.''

 NEW YORK: exchanged hands.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Companies waiting in the wings to offer their shares to the
public for the first time were likely losers in Monday's market
decline as well. Three Internet concerns, Net Perceptions Inc.,
Proxicom Inc. and Launch Media Inc., had planned initial public
offerings this week. Until investors become more hospitable to
companies like these, such offerings are likely to remain on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists pointed to the effect that hordes of rapid-fire day
traders _ many of whom are relative newcomers to stocks and have
yet to experience a severe, protracted decline in stock prices _
could have on the market. In recent months, these traders have
created momentum and profits as they piled into stocks. If they are
now piling out, they may create tidal waves of selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case where a lot of these stocks have some
unreasonable gains,'' said Laszlo Birinyi, who heads his own stock
research firm in Greenwich, Conn. ``Now people are starting to lock
in the gains when they can. As these stocks decline from their
highs, the movement feeds on itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime traders worry that a flood of calls from brokerage
firms will go out to stock investors on Tuesday for more funds to
prop up diminished portfolios that they have borrowed against to
buy more stocks. Customers must meet these requests, known as
margin calls, with fresh money or with cash raised by selling
stocks. If shares are sold, the market decline could accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Ameritrade, a large discount brokerage firm,
said that it had slightly higher margin calls than normal, adding
that it had no discernible problems with trading. She also said
that the brokerage firm had previously imposed higher borrowing
limits, presumably lessening the number of margin calls that would
go out to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, investors could jump back into their former stock
darlings if they judge the selling to be overdone. Such a strategy
has served them well in the last five years and was especially
shrewd when the market rebounded from its correction in October.
Microsoft, for example announces its earnings on Monday. Investors
may like what they see and bid the stock back up again.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wien of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said that the United
States stock market remains overvalued and that the broad market
averages will experience a correction, defined by traders as a
decline of 20 percent. ``What you're seeing is a resolution of
excessive valuation in the market. I expect the indexes to decline
further, but I don't think we're in a bear market.''

RAGHUBIR SINGH, 58, PHOTOGRAPHER WHO SOUGHT TO CAPTURE INDIA ON
FILM  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Raghubir Singh, who photographed the pulsating
expanse of India in all its varied shades and hues, died on Sunday
in Manhattan, where he lived. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
   He died after collapsing, apparently from a heart attack, said
his companion, Gwen Darien.
</P>
<P>
   A retrospective exhibition of Singh's photographs taken over the
last 30 years, ``River of Color: The India of Raghubir Singh,'' is
on view at the Art Institute of Chicago. A large book of the same
title containing pictures from nearly every corner of India,
Singh's last book and 13th collection, was recently published by
Phaidon Press.
</P>
<P>
   Singh was well read, intense and a man of strong opinions on a
wide range of cultural subjects. A patient artist, he once spent a
year photographing the change of seasons in the Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
   He had lived and worked in London, Paris and New York, but as he
made clear in his photographs and his occasional writings, his
lifelong subject and the fundamental sensibility through which he
perceived it were Indian. He had, after all, been steeped in what
he called the river of color from a childhood enriched by the
springtime festival Holi, in which women sprayed men with colored
water. He once recalled that the gold threads in his mother's blue
sari ``shone like stars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike those in the West, Indians have always intuitively seen
and controlled color,'' he wrote in the introduction to his last
book, adding that while Indians have come to admire the
black-and-white art of the West, ``the Indian photographer cannot
produce the angst and alienation rooted in the works of Western
photographers such as Brassai, Bill Brandt, Robert Frank and Diane
Arbus.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Henri Cartier-Bresson, the French photographer
whom he came to know, described color photography by using
``unprintable French army language.'' And while he acknowledged
being indebted to Cartier-Bresson for his emphasis on visual
surprise and the spontaneity that could be attained with small
cameras, he could no more disavow color as a medium than he could
reject the food and smells he had known all his life. All of his
books, among them works devoted to Kashmir, Calcutta, Bombay,
Benares, the Ganges and India's Grand Trunk Road, are filled
exclusively with color images.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond showing the rich palette of India's landscape and
peoples, many of his pictures also reveal an Indian way of seeing,
in that they simultaneously capture several equally important knots
of activity in the manner of old miniatures, rather than leading
the viewer's eye to some primary focal point. In a polytheistic
country, most things have many levels and lots of things happen at
once. In this respect, Singh's photographs have much in common with
the fury of the bazaar and the functional mayhem of Indian roads
and villages.
</P>
<P>
   Singh came to his views naturally from his childhood in a family
of Rajput aristocrats in Jaipur whose wealth and power were fading
as India became an independent republic.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote of the new lives his family members were fashioning:
``My father's Arab stallions were sold off; the horse carriages
began to rot. Our joint family house broke up, our large haveli
house became fragmented. I saw no future in staying.''
</P>
<P>
   He traveled to the other end of India, to Calcutta, intent upon
becoming a tea planter like an older brother. No one would hire him
so he spent his time taking pictures, a passion he had pursued
since high school when his mother gave him a camera. At one point
he showed his photographs to Satyajit Ray, the Bengali director,
whose response to them was, ``No guts.'' As the men became friends
and as the filmmaker saw more of Singh's work, he became more
admiring.
</P>
<P>
   By this time Singh, who is survived by a daughter, Devika, of
Paris, had begun to earn a living taking photographs for Indian and
foreign publications, among them National Geographic, Time, and The
New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Ray showed Singh his diary, in which decades earlier the Bengali
writer Rabindranath Tagore had written, ``I have spent a fortune
traveling to distant shores and looked at lofty mountains and
boundless oceans, and yet, I haven't found the time to take a few
steps from my home, to look at a single dewdrop, on a single blade
of grass.''
</P>
<P>
   The inscription impressed Singh greatly, he said, and he
referred to it in his introduction to ``River of Color.'' The India
that he set out to photograph, he wrote, ``was the India in the
dewdrop that Tagore talked of.'' He wrote that he had to dive into
the dewdrop and learn of India's art, morality and culture while at
the same time diving into the history of photography, ``which is
wholly Western.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he concluded: ``Wherever I have dived and come up for
air, the breath I take is deeply Indian because all my working life
I have photographed my country. In doing so, I have been carried by
the flow of the inner river of India's life and culture.''

VAN BREDA KOLFF HAS BIG PLANS FOR WAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU _ The standard for men's basketball in the West Coast
Conference used to be Pepperdine. Now it is Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   Jan van Breda Kolff, introduced as Pepperdine's new head men's
basketball coach Monday morning, said he wants the bar back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a unique situation,'' van Breda Kolff said. ``(We
have) a very good basketball team coming back.If the work ethic is
there and the determination is there, now it's just getting to that
next step: getting past Gonzaga and winning the league
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga won the WCC title this season, upset Stanford and
Florida in the NCAA Tournament and was one win away from the Final
Four before its run ended against eventual national champion
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine went 19-13 last season and finished second in the WCC
under head coach Lorenzo Romar, who resigned in March to take the
head position at Saint Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff said he wants to return the program to the
prominence it had from 1981-93, when coaches Jim Harrick and Tom
Asbury guided the Waves to a combined eight conference titles. The
Waves were selected to play in the NIT this season, marking their
first postseason appearance in five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's right on the cusp of being back where it was, back in the
days when Jim and Tom were here,'' van Breda Kolff said. ``That's
our goal. Other teams in our conference will use Pepperdine as a
barometer.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine athletic director John Watson, who was in charge of
the search committee, said van Breda Kolff was selected because of
his experience, his background and his character.
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff is the first coach Watson has hired since he was
named AD last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a man, in my judgment, who met all the standards we were
looking for,'' Watson said. ``A man who is committed to the mission
of this university, a strong Christian individual, a man of
character and integrity and a man who knows the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Pepperdine, van Breda Kolff was the head coach at
Vanderbilt for six seasons and Cornell for two.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt had six new players last year, and the Commodores
struggled to a 14-15 record. Lack of chemistry or experience isn't
the case at Pepperdine _ the Waves return four starters and have
top recruit Kevin Bradley projected as the starting point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do a lot of damage with the team we have,'' said Kelvin
Gibbs, a sophomore forward and the team's leading returning scorer.
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff said he uses a system that features an up-tempo
offense and a pressing and trapping defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to create offense off our defense,'' he said.
``Watching the film from last year, I think there is a lot of
athleticism here. I think we can be a team that can score more than
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs said he played van Breda Kolff's style in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will bring back a lot of memories,'' Gibbs said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff said he is going to use the next few days to
meet with returning players, contact the incoming recruits and form
a staff. He said he wants to have at least one assistant with ties
to the Los Angeles area.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ She had practiced her lines and prayed with her
mother. She had bought her children new clothes. After 10 years on
welfare, Michelle Crawford was leaving her run-down home in the
central city to speak to the Legislature, at the governor's
personal request. She clenched her notes so tightly in the back of
the car that it seemed she was trying to choke them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not much of a talker,'' she said, drawing anxious breaths
and jumbling her words as the Wisconsin countryside flew past.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, she stole the show.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside the man she calls ``Government Thompson'' _
Wisconsin's governor, Tommy Thompson _ Ms. Crawford explained how
his showcase welfare program had transformed her life. ``Today, I'm
working as a machine operator, providing for my family,'' she said.
Then with flawless timing, she pointed at the gallery where three
of her children were watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' she said, holding an emphatic finger in the air, ``I
tell my kids that this is what you get when you do your homework.''
Ms. Crawford's prime-time, televised performance _ her poise, her
humor, her confident smile _ filled the chamber with cheers and
transformed her, after a life of defeat, into a potent symbol of
success. In one resonating moment, she became the most celebrated
beneficiary of the most closely watched welfare program in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson recently drew a burst of applause when he retold ``her
inspiring story'' to a room of conservative supporters at a welfare
conference in Washington. ``I want to run for president,'' she
recalls him saying when they met three months ago, ``and I want you
on my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crawford's odyssey, from desperation to distinction, from
welfare to work, is indeed a powerful, inspiring story. It is also
an incomplete one, at least in its official telling. In a series of
interviews over several months, Ms. Crawford offered a far more
complicated account depicting a life that is much more difficult
than her admirers realize and less steady than the governor may
have hoped.
</P>
<P>
   In sharing her fuller story _ in explicit, even harrowing detail
_ she said she wanted even the most troubled women to know that
they, too, can move forward. ``I want to tell other girls, hey, if
you're going through something, I've been there,'' she said. ``I've
had those things thrown in my face: `You'll never be nothing.'
There's women out there scared.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Legislature heard, Ms. Crawford, 39, is off welfare and
on the job at a plastics factory outside Milwaukee. Indeed, after
years of severe anxiety and depression, her diligent record
recently earned her a raise, to $8.20 an hour. But she continues to
struggle with panic attacks, unpaid bills, and barbs from
co-workers and relatives who envy her achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Thompson again praised the effect her work was having
on her children. But only a few days earlier, her 19-year-old son
threw her life into new turmoil when he was arrested, charged with
possessing cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, such pressures have overwhelmed Ms. Crawford. She
was hospitalized for a nervous breakdown as recently as a year ago,
and she said her troubles had been brought on in part by the
pressures of the very program _ Wisconsin Works, or ``W-2'' _ whose
virtues she now represents.
</P>
<P>
   Initially she resented being forced to work for her welfare
check, of $673 a month. ``To me, it was just like slavery,'' she
said. ``I couldn't be with my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most worrisome, Ms. Crawford's success has brought new
strains to a volatile marriage. Her husband of two years, Donald
Crawford, is an aspiring minister who plays New Testament tapes
when he drives her to work and warns, ``If you put God first in
your life, the Devil won't have time to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also a recovering addict who says he received the Holy
Ghost in prison three years ago, where he was facing a possible 30
years for his role in torturing a man he suspected of stealing
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   At least four times last year, the Crawfords' relationship
erupted in violence. Twice, Crawford was led away in handcuffs for
striking his wife, who has been beaten by a succession of men over
the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But once it was Ms. Crawford who was placed under arrest, for
hitting her husband in the head with an iron and threatening him
with a knife. ``I was going berserk,'' she said, in an argument
over money. She said she hit her husband to defend herself, after
he restrained her by grabbing her throat.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their fights, Crawford sometimes supports his wife's
work life, through prayers, rides and baby-sitting services. But he
also worries that his role as the breadwinner is being usurped. ``I
don't like it, because I'm the man of the house,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions in their life were on full display one recent
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the house, Ms. Crawford was frantically phoning for the
details of her son's arrest. Outside, Crawford angrily complained
that his wife had failed to tell her admirers about his
contributions to her success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled that lady in there out of a lot of rough stuff,'' he
said. ``Don't kick me to the curb, like `I did it all by myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   Worried that she would call the police again, he accused Ms.
Crawford of ``telling lies on me.'' He added darkly, ``I don't like
liars.''

<P>
   In an interview last week following his speech about Ms.
Crawford, Thompson said he knew nothing of her violent marriage,
her son's arrest or her history of emotional duress. When sharing
the stage with her in January, he said, he did not even know she
was married. At the time, Crawford was out of the house, under a
restraining order from a court.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a somber tone, Thompson said he was saddened but not
surprised, since many women on public assistance struggled with
similar issues. A four-term Republican who is seen as a national
leader on welfare, he went on to say that Ms. Crawford's problems
made her achievements all the more impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a richer story; it shows how complex and how difficult
this is,'' he said. ``People start out with some real difficulties,
emotionally as well as educationally and culturally. To overcome
these things, it's not easy dealing with human frailties. Michelle
is very much a success story and continues to be so, even more so
because she's been able to overcome these adversities.''
</P>
<P>
   Julia Taylor, the president of YW Works, a state-financed
welfare agency that offered Ms. Crawford a remarkable array of
services, views the story as a warning against the simplistic view
that ``all you have to do is go out and get a job.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``getting a job certainly helps,'' she said, policy-makers
should remember ``it doesn't make all the problems go away, and
sometimes it intensifies problems. The public needs to understand
how hard people's lives are.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her moments of panic and doubt, Ms. Crawford also draws
on reserves of uncommon, even eloquent, resilience. In pushing poor
women like herself to find their hidden talents, she said, Thompson
``did a good thing with W-2.''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth of 13 siblings raised on welfare, Ms. Crawford has
struggled all her life. Her family moved to Milwaukee from Arkansas
when she was a child, on the tail of a vast migration of Southern
blacks chasing hope in the industrial North.
</P>
<P>
   But her father left their home when she was 7, and her mother
was still decades away from settling down. ``My mother was running
the streets,'' she said. ``When I was 15, I ran away. I told her I
wasn't taking care of all the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon she had children of her own. After an adolescence marred by
sexual abuse at the hands of a relative, Ms. Crawford left high
school, found a rough young man and followed him to Chicago. They
had a child when she was 18 and lost another a year later. ``He
beat it out of me,'' she said. ``It was a miscarriage.'' Two more
children followed, and too many beatings to count.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to Milwaukee and sought peace in pills _ the
devil's doing, as she sees it now. She drank. She battled urges to
hurt herself. Depleted in body and soul by the age of 24, she left
her children with her mother and entered a mental hospital. It took
her three years to grow strong enough to get her children back.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, when she met Donald Crawford in a training class for
welfare recipients, she had two more children, another violent
boyfriend, and a headful of worries. She admired Crawford from
across the room, but felt sure a man so tall and impressive _ 6
feet 2, with a wide, winning smile _ was already spoken for.
</P>
<P>
   He paired with her during interview rehearsals, showing her how
to impress an employer with a firm, confident grip. He drove her
home. He said he liked her. In 1996, he offered her a ring. ``I
thought he was joking,'' she said. ``Nobody ever wanted to marry
me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Crawford had problems of his own. Like his wife, he came
from a large family of Arkansas migrants, with 11 siblings. Like
his wife, he dropped out of school and battled an addiction _
cocaine, in his case.
</P>
<P>
   Though his father had a steady life as a janitor and a preacher,
Crawford has been on and off welfare, and in and out of jobs. By
1996, he had found a sideline helping a nephew sell drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Early that year, they suspected a boarder of stealing their
cocaine. They stripped, bound and gagged the man, beat him with a
2-by-4, poured boiling water on his naked body and whipped him with
a cord, according to an account the man gave the police 10 days
later. Despite his injuries, the victim said he had stayed in the
house for a week after the assault, until Crawford, accusing him of
stealing a coat, assaulted him again.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford said his nephew was the main assailant, but
acknowledged, ``I had a hand in it.''
</P>
<P>
   On his knees in the cell where he was being held for the crime,
Crawford wept and prayed for divine intervention. ``I said, `Lord,
forgive me, it's all in your hands,'' he said. ``The Holy Ghost
came and filled me with the Spirit. Ever since then, nothing's
turned me around.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford was released a few weeks later. The victim, who told
the police he feared being killed if he testified, declined to
pursue the charges. Crawford proposed shortly after his release,
and Ms. Crawford accepted the following year. They married in July
1997.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The state began its bold remaking of the welfare system two
months later, requiring virtually everyone on cash assistance to
work for their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crawford was sent to a work site where her duties involved
picking up trash. She felt humiliated. After a life filled with
insults, she says, she felt as if the program equated her with the
garbage bags in her hand. ``It felt like they were punishing us,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Problems in the program collided with problems at home. Her
husband had rented an upstairs apartment to relatives who began
selling drugs. He got an eviction order. They got a gun. The
Crawfords constantly quarreled _ about his disruptive relatives,
her resentful children, and a pile of unpaid bills.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, Crawford was arrested for grabbing her by the
throat. In March, she went to jail for hitting him with the iron.
In May, she sought professional help, returning to a psychiatric
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a nervous breakdown,'' she said. ``I just didn't want to
live no more.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed next was an extraordinary collaboration, between a
creative agency and a tenacious client. YW Works, one of five
private agencies that run the welfare program in Milwaukee,
initially made Ms. Crawford's work assignment the pursuit of her
psychiatric care.
</P>
<P>
   After a month of intensive therapy, the agency sent her to a
plastics plant it had just bought to train poor clients. Though she
started in housekeeping, her supervisor noticed her unusual drive.
Others goofed off when vacuum cleaners broke, but Ms. Crawford
grabbed a broom. By August, the supervisor had promoted her onto
the assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   Not every day passed peacefully. Failing to take the medication
that helps control her mood swings, Ms. Crawford erupted one
morning and denounced her supervisor as a racist. He calmed her
down and sent her home, and by the next morning she was back on the
line, molding minnow buckets. ``They really put up with me,'' Ms.
Crawford said. ``They were like family to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, her supervisor drove her to a job interview, and she
fell to her knees when she was hired. ``I said, `Thank you, Jesus'
_ I'm going to be paying taxes, too!'' Off cash assistance since
the fall, Ms. Crawford receives $65 a month in food stamps and the
coaching of a job retention specialist employed by YW Works.
</P>
<P>
   When the governor toured the training plant in January, Ms.
Crawford was invited to join a group of clients meeting with him.
She gave him a hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir, I didn't like it _ but it worked for me,'' she said. A
few days later, Thompson startled his aides and Ms. Crawford by
inviting her to join him onstage at his annual State of the State
address. ``She is exuberant,'' he said. ``There was an instant
chemistry between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Six days after their first, brief encounter, Ms. Crawford was
standing before the Legislature. ``I thought I would always be on
welfare,'' she told her statewide audience. But now, ``my kids see
a difference in me,'' she said. ``I ask others to take a chance on
W-2 workers. We won't let you down.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the speech, Thompson recalled, ``There wasn't a
dry eye, including myself _ I even get teared up now when I talk
about it. It was just so emotional, so right, and so correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone thinks so. Her co-workers resent Ms. Crawford's
celebrity, and her mother and sister are furious. After failing to
comply with the work program, her sister was recently evicted, and
she matches Ms. Crawford's admiration for the governor with equally
potent spite. Her mother and sister ``hate Thompson's guts,'' Ms.
Crawford said. ``They said it's wrong to say those things about
W-2, because W-2 is messing up other people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, her husband, too, chafes at her prominence, and
the three children still living at home _ Lorenzo, 14, Lavita, 11,
and Yolando, 7 _ often chafe at her husband. ``I'm trying to go
straight in the Lord,'' he said. But his anger flared just a moment
later, when he noted that in her defining hour, Ms. Crawford
``didn't say nothing about me.''
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested last November, after another fight. But despite
the court order removing him from the home, Ms. Crawford let him
return after her speech. She praised him in a recent conversation,
saying, ``He doesn't hit women; he's a Christian man.'' In dreams,
she sometimes sees him in white, standing in a pulpit. ``We need
each other,'' she said. ``You just can't do things by yourself. You
need a helping hand.''
</P>
<P>
   She was scheduled to tell her story in Washington this week
before a congressional panel. She wanted to arrive in a limousine
and meet ``important people.'' But her son's drug arrest cost her
two days of work, and Ms. Crawford is sagging from the pressures of
the publicity. She plans to spend the day making plastic valves
instead, as she has through six months of crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like getting up in the morning, going to my job,'' she said.
``I just feel good about myself.''

   With the United States' welfare rolls down 43 percent, President
Clinton, as well as his Republican critics, count the landmark 1996
welfare law as the cornerstone of their respective legacies. That
law replaced a 60-year-old cash safety net with a program of time
limits and work requirements.
</P>
<P>
   No place has come closer than Wisconsin to the goal of ``ending
welfare.'' A decade ago, 100,000 Wisconsin families relied on
public aid. Now 9,000 do.
</P>
<P>
   The changes taking place in the state, particularly in its
largest city, Milwaukee, continue to reverberate in broad and
unpredictable ways. Throughout the year, The New York Times is
returning to Milwaukee to plot the pattern of change.

TANUI CAN'T GO THE DISTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The will was strong, but the body was weak.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four kilometers into Monday's Boston Marathon, Moses
Tanui suddenly felt pain in his stomach. The urge to vomit
overwhelmed him. He stopped. He walked. He sipped water. He
attempted to run again.
</P>
<P>
   But just past the 35K mark (22 miles) on Chestnut Hill Avenue in
Brighton, the defending champion reluctantly decided he could not
continue.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Tanui did not finish a marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy because everybody cried when I stopped, but I
had no other way,'' said Tanui, who was too ill to attend the
postrace press conference and was reached by phone as he rested in
his room at the Athletes' Village. ``It was very sad. Everyone was
waiting, and all of a sudden this problem came.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanui said his training this year was much better than in 1998,
when he won the race in 2:07:34. But over the last three weeks,
according to his coach, Dr. Gabriele Rosa, Tanui said he did not
feel well and had symptoms similar to a chest cold. Rosa suggested
Tanui get a checkup, but the runner declined, telling his coach not
to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa believes that Tanui's cold symptoms and his failure to
finish may be connected. Tuesday Tanui departs for Italy, his
coach's home, for tests.
</P>
<P>
   Said Tanui, ``I want to test everything because it was very
unusual for me. I was completely confused because I don't know what
happened to my body.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the 30-kilometer mark, Tanui kept pace with the
frontrunners but never surged into the lead. He appeared to be
running the same type of smart race that enabled him to come from
behind and win in 1998. Last year Tanui was 11 seconds back at the
35K mark, but he surged to win in the third-fastest time on the
course.
</P>
<P>
   This year, many of the elite runners were keying off Tanui,
waiting for him to make a big move. They waited until the moment
the defending champion stopped.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Tanui has been an unmistakable presence at the
Boston Marathon. With his dignified carriage, carefully measured
words, and two titles, the athlete from Eldoret, Kenya, serves as
an ambassador of sorts for the elite runners.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Kenyan spectators was shocked when they learned that
Tanui had dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a shame,'' said Michael Odhiambo, a student at
Northeastern School of Law from Nairobi. ``But we have nine more
runners and I am confident we are going to take it for the ninth
year in a row.''

CAPITAL INVOKES FRAMERS IN VOTING-RIGHTS SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Relief, 200 years late, can be ordered,'' the
lawyer for the District of Columbia told a special three-judge
court Monday in arguing in its lawsuit against the federal
government that residents of the city should be allowed to vote for
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, John M. Ferren, the city's corporation counsel,
invoked the founding fathers, saying that Patrick Henry, Alexander
Hamilton and James Madison all spoke, in the convention that drew
up the Constitution, in favor of such voting rights for residents
of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   When the presiding judge, Louis F. Oberdorfer of the federal
district court here, noted Monday that no less an eminence than
Chief Justice John Marshall had disagreed with that position,
Ferren conceded the point but argued that Marshall had not been at
the Constitutional Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The 23rd Amendment gave the city's residents the right to vote
for president, and federal laws have established local elections.
But lawyers for the city argued Monday that its 500,000 residents
were being unconstitutionally deprived of their right to vote for
congressional representation, a right residents had for 11 years
until Maryland and Virginia, the states from which the District of
Columbia was carved, took it away in 1800.
</P>
<P>
   The District of Columbia is represented by a nonvoting delegate
in the House of Representatives, Eleanor Holmes Norton.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel was appointed to hear the case because of
the complex nature of the issues. Whatever it rules, it is certain
to be appealed to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The status quo is being defended by the Justice Department,
although Attorney General Janet Reno has said that she supports
voting rights. Because President Clinton and other federal
officials are defendants in the case, Justice Department lawyers
are defending them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution leaves us no choice,'' John R. Tyler, the
senior trial counsel in the civil division of the Justice
Department, argued in court Monday. ``The framers intended that
representation in Congress be reserved to the people of the several
states.''
</P>
<P>
   The city contends that while it is not a state, its residents
enjoy virtually all other constitutional rights, like trial by
jury.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it was opposing the suit only on
constitutional grounds, because Article 1 says congressional
representatives would be elected ``by the people of the several
states'' and it was not taking a stand on a political solution to
the question.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that the right for District of Columbia
residents to vote for congressional representation must be won
through constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the panel, Judge Merrick B. Garland of the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, raised
political questions about the case.
</P>
<P>
   If the District of Columbia sent one person to the House and two
to the Senate, Garland asked Ferren, would that not dilute the
power of the congressional delegations from the states and lead
them to oppose it?
</P>
<P>
   Ferren said the nation dealt with such dilutions each time it
expanded, from 13 to 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   The third member of the panel is Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of
the federal district court.
</P>
<P>
   In his summation, Ferren said: ``We are talking about the most
precious, the most fundamental right that any of us can have, the
right to vote. This right is at the very heart of a government we
fought a Revolutionary War to gain, a Civil War to protect, and
world wars in which men and women of the District of Columbia, like
men and women from all over this country, died to keep.
</P>
<P>
   ``But unlike every other adult citizen of the 50 states _
indeed, unlike men and women with whom we work side by side every
day, who live in Maryland and Virginia _ we don't have the right to
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremonial courtroom in the federal courthouse was jammed
with supporters of the voting rights suit, many of them voicing
their agreement as the lawyers spoke.
</P>
<P>
   When one of the principal lawyers bringing the suit, George
LaRoche, made a popular point, there was applause from the
spectators. Oberdorfer pounded his desk twice for order, using his
fist instead of a gavel.
</P>
<P>
   Ferren concluded his argument by declaring: ``If the framers
were here today, I believe they would be astonished that the
half-million citizens of our nation's capital _ unlike any other
capital of a democracy in the world _ do not have the right to vote
for those who govern them.''

 Salon Caps Changes With IPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Dan Fost &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Salon.com will soon see if a literary reputation and online cachet
lead to stock market riches.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Web publisher of literature, commentary and
news filed yesterday to sell stock to the public. It hopes to raise
at least $26 million by offering 24 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The move caps a rush of news out of Salon in recent weeks _ new
financial backing, a national advertising campaign, a redesigned
Web site, the acquisition of the online community the WELL and,
most notably, the changing of its name from Salon Magazine to
Salon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, companies with a ``.com'' at the end of their name
are commanding high stock market valuations, even if they don't
generate any profits.
</P>
<P>
   Salon certainly fits that model. According to the filing, the
company has lost $10.5 million since its inception in July 1995,
and expects continued losses in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   In the last nine months of last year, Salon brought in $2.1
million in revenue _ nearly triple the revenues for the same period
in 1997 _ but it lost $4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials declined to comment, citing the ``quiet
period'' mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The company relies on banner ads and sponsorships for 93 percent
of its revenue, and it has a relatively small number of
advertisers. For instance, just one advertiser, Borders bookstores,
accounted for 18 percent of Salon's revenues in the nine-month
period. Salon plans to develop electronic commerce sponsorships, as
well as add shopping capabilities to its site.
</P>
<P>
   The filing also noted that Salon may publish controversial
content that could irritate advertisers. The site gained wide
notoriety for its decision last year to break the news that U.S.
Representative Henry Hyde, R-Ohio, _ a leader in the movement to
impeach President Clinton _ had an extramarital affair 30 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many money-losing Internet firms have been able to generate huge
valuations under the theory that more people will be online as the
Internet becomes easier to use, and the companies that establish
Internet brands early will be poised to make significant profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will have to tell if this is all insanity or if spending
money to build a brand is money well spent,'' said Ben Holmes,
president of IPOPros.com, an independent research firm in Boulder,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   In an online world in which stories are short and news breaks
fast, Salon is almost an anomaly: A site that publishes thoughtful
commentary and well-known writers. It's been compared to the New
Yorker or the Atlantic Monthly, neither of which has a significant
online presence. Salon's only real online competition comes from
Slate, which is published by Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Salon was founded by a group of former San Francisco Examiner
editors. David Talbot, the Examiner's former arts and entertainment
editor, is chairman and editor in chief, overseeing a site that
publishes writing on travel, technology, arts, media, books,
politics and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Salon announced it had raised $15 million from a
variety of private investors. It also announced the hiring of achief financial officer and a vice president of sales, and it named
legendary television producer Norman Lear, the creator of ``All in
the Family,'' to its board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Salon plans to sell 2.5 million shares for between $10.50 and
$13.50 per share, which would raise between $26.25 million and
$33.75 million. A price of $10.50 per share would value the company
at $112.35 million, while the higher valuation would make it worth
$144.45 million.
</P>
<P>
   Salon's underwriters are W.R. Hambrecht + Co. and Daiwa
Securities America Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The initial public offering will provide a major test of
Hambrecht's new OpenIPO format, in which average investors get to
bid on shares before the offering price is set. While many hot
Internet offerings open at low prices but then soar when trading
begins, the OpenIPO system theoretically should bring offering
prices in line with the actual trading prices.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only Ravenswood Winery has used the system and that
company, which went public this month, has held far steadier than
the more volatile Internet offerings.

 Why the Time Could Be Right for Considering Sector Rotation
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Mark Veverka &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Isn't it about time that you finally have that discussion with your
teenage kids about, you know, um, sector rotation?
</P>
<P>
   Better that you do this before they learn about it on the
streets. It's time for tough love. Somebody has to tell junior to
log off and listen up: Not all overpriced technology stocks can go
up forever. Sooner or later, cheap stocks with wads of cash and
smart management are eventually going to lead the market.
</P>
<P>
   It is the unpleasant obligation of parents to deliver this
painful message to the ones they love. Sector rotation, of course,
is one of those $2 Wharton phrases that means investors are
shifting their preferences from certain groups of stocks that were
once on fire to others that had been sucking wind.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when institutions start pulling their money out of
Microsoft and Merck and begin plunking it down on Boeing, Allied
Signal and Minnesota, Mining and Manufacturing _ as they have been
over the past couple of days _ time may be of the essence to talk
to the kids.
</P>
<P>
   As noted last week in this column, cyclical stocks _ those that
are sensitive to economic factors such as interest rates _ caught
an updraft last week. And they continued to surge northward
yesterday into the teeth of a fierce Nasdaq sell-off as the
tech-heavy index suffered its second-biggest point drop in history.
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt shift from sexy growth stocks to boring value plays
is definitely real, but will it be a long-term relationship or just
a tease?
</P>
<P>
   Byron Wien, the chief investment strategist at Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, thinks the ``big move'' to cyclical stocks isn't over.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's just one expert's opinion. Wall Street
strategists and money managers are divided on this one. Many are
still picking up the pieces from yesterday's avalanche on the
Nasdaq Stock Market, wondering if their favorite names in
technology won't rebound faster than a mediocre Web site can go
public.
</P>
<P>
   There is some concern that the shift had been so quick and
pronounced that cyclicals might peak early and technology would
recover as nicely as it did after last August's ruble ruse. But
Wien doesn't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (cyclicals) have a ways to go, (and) I think the
upward trend will broaden to include small- and mid-cap stocks,''
Wien stated in a research note yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   So, what are you gonna do? Buy a little America Online on the
dip or take the value plunge and buy cheap manufacturing stocks?
</P>
<P>
   Wien is telling his clients to start looking for attractive
small- and mid-size stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the U.S. economy turns in another strong quarter, it should
be favorable for cyclicals and smaller stocks. Managements of
cyclical companies focus on revenues and therefore benefit from a
strong economic environment. Since these stocks trade relatively
thinly, a little money flowing into them tends to make a big
impact,'' Wien says.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the strategist points out that the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index remains about 25 percent ``overvalued'' according
to Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's economic models.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, he ``still expects a correction in the
not-too-distant future, (and) this may become the firm foundation
for a change in (sector) leadership,'' Wien says.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, nobody said that sector rotation would be pretty. As loyal
Street Smart readers may recall, Wien's counterpart at PaineWebber,
Ed Kerschner, also predicted a market correction for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   One of the scenarios is that the shift into cyclicals might
precede a minor correction of about 5 percent, setting the table
for another bull run fueled, this time, by small- and mid-cap
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the small-cap bulls aren't holding their breath. They
desperately want to believe. For more than four years, the
Lilliputians have been getting trampled in the land of the giants,
says William Edwards, president of Palo Alto Investors, a $60
million small-cap hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are pleasant things for us to hear, but we haven't seen
any evidence of it yet,'' Edwards says.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the undervalued stocks discovered in recent days have
been large-cap cyclicals. Meantime, small caps have been on the
sidelines for so long that even their most ardent fans are reticent
to declare that the tide is turning. (Small caps are widely
considered to be stocks with valuations under $1 billion.)
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index, a primary benchmark for small-cap
stocks, has seen about a 10 percent annualized return since April
1994, compared to about a 26 percent yearly return for the Dow
Jones industrials and a 27 percent performance by the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a staggering period of underperformance (for small
stocks). I`ve never experienced anything like this in my career,''
Edwards says.
</P>
<P>
   With the nudge of a stronger global economy, that's nothing that
a little sector rotation couldn't fix.

 Privacy Worries at the Grocery Store
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Rebecca Smith &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Frequent-shopper cards are sweeping the grocery industry with
eye-catching discounts for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   They have also caught the eye of California legislators who are
considering consumer protections amid growing fear the discount
cards pose a threat to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Two bills are moving through the state Senate to restrict the
collection and use of data gleaned from ``loyalty marketing'' cards
like the Safeway and Vons ``Club'' card and the Lucky ``Rewards''
card. A third bill would beef up privacy rights of consumers
throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Though they differ in their particulars, the bills share a
common fear of the way the grocery industry could use its
computer-based tool to monitor and modify consumer behavior. The
bills brush aside industry assurances that the discount cards are
harmless successors to previous supermarket promotional gimmicks
like green stamps and coupons.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone objects to having information collected on their
buying habits, says state Senator Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey
(Los Angeles County), one of the concerned legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ``But right now, people have no ability to find out what's being
collected or how it's &LR;   &LR; being used or shared,'' she says. ``We need
to give that control back to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it's true that shoppers sign up for cards voluntarily,
the best savings often are reserved for cardholders who must give
personal information when filling out application forms. Those
without cards must rely on coupons for savings.
</P>
<P>
   To date, there's no proof the industry is abusing its power to
collect information on shopper preferences and purchases. But
legislators like Bowen fear chains eventually will find the
temptation irresistible to sell or share data.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen, for example, if health insurers could buy
lists of people who buy cartons of cigarettes? What if
liquor-purchase records were readily available to employers for
pre-employment screening? What if weight-loss companies could get
the names of couch potatoes?
</P>
<P>
   The supermarket industry insists it uses discount cards to
funnel savings to the best shoppers, making scarce promotional
dollars work harder in an era when it's facing withering
competition from new food retailers like Kmart, Costco and Arco's
AM/PM markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grocers are as concerned, as anyone, about privacy issues,''
said David Heylen, spokesman for the California Grocers Association
in Sacramento. ``I'm not aware of any company that uses information
inappropriately or that supplies it to outsiders.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, powerful database software gives grocers the
ability to merge data on millions of individual transactions and to
reveal for the first time purchasing patterns. And they can track
the spending habits and tastes of individual shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how it works: Shoppers are issued individual cards with
bar codes on the back. After groceries are rung up, the cards are
scanned and a computer deducts savings in a matter of seconds. It
keeps a running log so discount certificates can be issued when
certain spending thresholds are reached, such as for $250 or $500.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers like the ease of getting discounts automatically with
no need to clip coupons. Stores like being able to trim advertising
budgets and funnel the best savings to shoppers who bring in the
most revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use the information to provide better service to
shoppers,'' said Kevin Herglotz, spokesman for the 325-store Vons
chain in Los Angeles. ``We do not sell information or provide it to
any outside vendor.''
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this year, Vons fought allegations that its lawyers
threatened to use liquor-purchase information in a lawsuit pressed
against the chain by a shopper who slipped and fell in a Vons
store.
</P>
<P>
   That case was thrown out of court and Herglotz said no such
threat ever was made by Vons' attorneys. But the story continues to
circulate.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there's nothing in California law to prohibit such a
use of club card information, legislators point out.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the supermarket industry different from other
industries that possess sensitive information. For example, the
video rental industry can't sell or share movie rental information.
Credit card issuers can't tell others what you're buying, and
telephone companies can't reveal whom you're calling.
</P>
<P>
   Three bills could establish similar protections over supermarket
data:
</P>
<P>
   _The proposed Supermarket Club Disclosure Act of 1999, which
passed the Senate Appropriations Committee yesterday and is headed
for a vote on the Senate floor later this week, would require club
card issuers to disclose how they use data. The bill, being carried
by Bowen, would give shoppers the right to have sales data deleted.
</P>
<P>
   _The proposed Supermarket Privacy Act of 1999 would give
cardholders the right to prohibit the ``collection, distribution,
aggregation or marketing'' of cardholder information collected
after January 2000. Under the bill by state Senator Jackie Speier,
D-Hillsborough, unauthorized sharing of information would subject
the chain to a $500 fine, per infraction.
</P>
<P>
   _The most sweeping bill, however, is the Personal Information
and Privacy Act of 1999, carried by state Senator Steve Peace, D-El
Cajon (San Diego County), that would presume privacy has been
violated anytime information is collected without the consent of
those from whom information was garnered. The bill would apply to
any industry or government agency collecting the data.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective is to do something globally so we don't have to
keep plugging privacy holes, industry by industry,'' said Peace.
``We have to act because the commercial interests simply are
overwhelming any practical right of privacy in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Peace said it makes most people uncomfortable to have data
collected on their purchases, even if it's used innocently.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to collect information on every supermarket purchase
I made, I'd view myself as having an anal-retentive compulsive
disorder,'' Peace said. ``It's an extraordinary violation, to me,
to think someone else can document my behavior just because I shop
at their store.''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks the need for privacy is deep in human DNA and explains
why the ``loyalty'' programs cause such uneasiness. His theory is
based on the idea that Early Man hid himself in order to hunt.
Privacy wasn't a frill, it was a survival skill. Those who couldn't
hide or whose patterns of behavior could be unlocked became the
prey.
</P>
<P>
   This fear of being understood and exploited is not irrational,
says Joseph Turow, communications professor at the University of
Pennsylvania, who has written on loyalty marketing programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The supermarket is the place where you can learn important
information about how people live their lives,'' he says. ``There
are Big Brother aspects to this that need to be understood.''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks the industry will be driven to sell data eventually,
because it has great value if combined with other types of
information. ``You wind up with lifestyle data that was never
possible to get before the computer,'' Turow says.
</P>
<P>
   Club cards, though they have proliferated rapidly, are a
relatively new addition to the shopping scene. The trend started in
1993 when a study funded by the Coca Cola Retailing Research Group
found that not all grocery shoppers are equal.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, the study concluded that 30 percent of shoppers
generate 75 percent of sales revenues. Rather than distribute
promotional dollars across the board, the study suggested, it would
make more sense for grocers to identify and reward the top tier
with loyalty marketing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky Stores was the first major chain in California to offer a
card _ in April 1995. Safeway was one of the last and didn't get
its card to shoppers until September 1997. No one knows how many
cards are being used, today, but industry analysts think a majority
of consumers have at least one card.

APPLE MEDIA SOFTWARE CHALLENGES 2 RIVALS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUPERTINO, Calif. _ In a direct challenge to both the Microsoft
Corp. and Real Networks Inc., Apple Computer on Monday introduced a
new version of its Quicktime multimedia software designed to permit
computer users to receive video and audio programming over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The distribution of multimedia content is emerging as one of the
hottest businesses on the Internet. Last week in Hollywood,
Microsoft announced its own technology in the field, known as MS
Audio 4.0, and the International Business Machines Corp. and Sony
Inc. announced an agreement to make their competing systems
compatible with each other.
</P>
<P>
   All three companies, plus a handful of other developers, large
and small, are vying to produce the technology that will ultimately
be adopted as the standard by the recording industry. That industry
is deeply concerned about the rapid growth of a vibrant cottage
industry around the MP3 audio standard, a format for storing audio
files.
</P>
<P>
   Because MP3 has no built-in copyright protection schemes, the
recording industry views it as a serious threat; hundreds of
thousands of MP3 users are already exchanging music over the
Internet without paying musicians or record companies.
</P>
<P>
   Multimedia programs _ incorporating audio, video, and computer
graphics _ can be played on computers in two basic ways: streaming
media, which delivers the program as the user watches or listens,
and downloaded media, which is delivered in its entirety to the
user's hard drive and then viewed or heard. Programming can
originate from television or radio broadcasts or from recorded
music.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the battle over the market for Internet viewing of
multimedia presentations has largely been between Microsoft, which
has built many of the most popular formats into its Windows Media
Player, and Real Networks, maker of the Realplayer streaming
software. However, analysts said Monday that Apple's strategy would
probably make it a three-way race.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to announcing an initial public test, or beta, for
Quicktime 4, Apple said it would offer software that would make it
possible for server computers using its Mac OS X operating system
to distribute multimedia content over the Internet. They said the
server software would support a streaming technology that has been
defined as a standard by an Internet engineering task force backed
by many companies.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, at the National Association of Broadcasters meeting
in Las Vegas, Apple executives said Monday that its new server
software would have the support of several key hardware
manufacturers, including Cisco Systems, IBM, Silicon Graphics Inc.
and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   The result will be relatively inexpensive server computers that
will allow independent artists or small businesses to offer
programming to large audiences over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said Monday that Apple should have a
significant advantage in the market for Internet multimedia
software since much of the multimedia material already offered on
line was originally created in the Quicktime format.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the media,'' said Andrew Gore, editor in chief
of Macworld magazine. ``For movies, they have a tremendous
advantage. However, for live video, Microsoft has made a
significant inroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple officials said Monday that the company's strategy was
different from those of both Real Networks, which charges a
licensing fee for its server software, and Microsoft, which offers
its server technology only on the proprietary Windows NT operating
system. Because Apple is releasing the source code for its server
software, it will be simple for organizations that want to transmit
multimedia material to adapt their own systems. Phil Schiller,
Apple's vice president for worldwide marketing, said the company
would make an effort to insure that the new Quicktime software
incorporates a wide variety of different media formats known as
``codecs'' (for compression-decompression), bodies of software
coding that transform audio and video programming into digital
format for transmission and translate it back on the user's
computer. ``We support more codecs than anyone in the world,''
Schiller said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in recent months the competition in the streaming media
market has shifted to a battle to demonstrate the highest quality
in codecs. While it is hard to tell the differences when one is
using a modem that delivers speeds of 56,000 bits a second,
Schiller said, the rapid shift among consumers to high-speed cable
modems and digital subscriber lines, is making distinctions more
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The Quicktime 4 viewer can be downloaded free by both Windows
and Macintosh users from Apple's Web site. A $29.95 version lets
users create and edit digital content. And separately, Apple said
Monday that it had begun shipping professional video authoring
software.

 (ATTN: Conn., N.J.)  (mk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ By the time Bill Rodgers reached the top of Heartbreak
Hill, his legs were fading and, much worse, his eyes were lying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started seeing flashing lights,'' he said. ``That's the sure
sign of dehydration.''
</P>
<P>
   That was also his cue to exit the Boston Marathon on Monday,
stage left, into a Red Cross tent that just happened to be
stationed there, like the last exit on the highway to Hades. It
wasn't quite the Eliot Lounge on Commonwealth Ave. _ a bygone
establishment on whose premises Rodgers once quit this famous race
_ but when those body alarms start sounding at the advanced
runner's age of 51, the judicious choice would seem to be the bed
over the beer.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers, knowing what awaited him if he insisted on finishing
the last five miles, told himself, ``I've dropped out here
before,'' and so it was that he did once more.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, he had not returned to Boston just to run
recreationally, any more than Wayne Gretzky played hockey to glide
around the ice. Rodgers did jog and wave to the crowd in 1996, the
centennial race, and that was fun but that gets old. He could do
that when he's 61. They call the contenders elite runners in this
grueling sport. When the legs go, the self-image does not.
</P>
<P>
   This time, having not run a competitive marathon since 1992, the
patriarch of American marathoners came with a stopwatch and a
dream.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers was aiming for a 2-hour-30-minute finish, an over-50
record and a rare yelp of Yankee exultation in a sport he owned
long before it became the national pastime of Kenya. He won here
for the first time in 1975, when Monday's winner, Joseph Chebet,
was jogging to nursery school in the Kenyan bush. Rodgers won four
Boston Marathons, four more in New York, and Monday's was his 52nd
overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the good over 40 and over 50 runners come to it
late,'' he said. ``My body was trying to tell me something, that
those 52 marathons have taken a toll. So maybe trying to set a
record on a sunny day on this particular course wasn't a good
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe LeMay could've told him that and saved him the pain. Then
again, LeMay, 32, represents the contemporary American marathoner,
whose objectives are more associated with surviving such a course
than actually defeating it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you get through Boston without crashing and burning,
that's a good day,'' he said, perhaps coining a modern American
mantra.
</P>
<P>
   Out of Danbury, Conn., by way of Ridgewood High School in New
Jersey and Princeton University, LeMay took the early-morning ride
to the start in Hopkinton, Mass., hoping to run his fifth marathon
in the vicinity of 2:13 or 2:14. He thought that a little
cooperation from his cranky back combined with one lucky break _
like the disappearance of the Kenyan bus _ might have put him in
the run for the prize money.
</P>
<P>
   Those aspirations went awry with the weather. ``I made a promise
to myself that if it got close to 70 degrees, I would shoot for
2:16,'' LeMay said. He finished at 2:16:11, in 13th place, the
first American to cross. In Chicago last October, they awarded
prize money for this distinction, but, as LeMay said, ``Two-sixteen
is not bad but not very good considering the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not exactly a fair fight, for several reasons, one of
them being that the Kenyans train together and don't spend their
weekdays in the employ of a computer company, as does LeMay. He
fiddles with a mouse for 40 hours, runs 120 miles and, in his spare
time, takes an honest look in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say the only reason they're so much better is that
we work, but it's not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Having concentrated on the 10,000 meters for much of his career,
LeMay said he always wanted to try marathons after watching Rodgers
as a kid. ``Most kids were looking at football and baseball
players,'' he said. ``For me, it was Bill. I've always wanted to
shoot for 2:10 because that's what he was running when he was
winning. For me, he's the man who set the standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers once gave LeMay a pep talk after a disastrous 1993
marathon debut in New York. The next piece of counsel could be that
standards are not set by playing it safe. LeMay held back and wound
up admitting his result was ``not very good.'' A smiling Rodgers
was helped into the interview room by a Red Cross volunteer and
made it clear there was no other way.
</P>
<P>
   They were 20 years and a generational mind-set apart.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  NAPLES, Fla. _ The remarkable thing about Zoran, the
52-year-old fashion designer, is not that he has grown rich by
selling clothes that have changed little in 20 years or that he
enjoys provoking retailers and clients with the occasional insult.
No, the amazing thing is how someone with his practical wisdom and
perverse assurance could still be such a fashion secret.

   Think of Calvin Klein or Ralph Lauren, and instantly you get a
picture of sleek models with ironed hair on the one hand, and on
the other, of all-American beauties in an atmosphere of old money,
authentic-looking right down to their prep-school faces and the
chipped paint on the porch floor.
</P>
<P>
   But Zoran? Zoran doesn't advertise, and even if he did it's
doubtful it would do much good, since his clothes are almost
indescribably plain, consisting of four or five solid colors, all
in the same expensive fabrics, like cashmere and Tasmanian wool,
yet minimally cut, without zippers or buttons _ a uniform, in
effect. The look has been described as ``Gap for the very rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Zoran put on fashion shows or court celebrities, the
usual way for designers looking for publicity. In fact, the list of
fashionable women that Zoran (like Halston, he uses only his first
name) has dressed over the years _ Queen Noor, Candice Bergen,
Lauren Bacall, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis _ is almost as impressive
as the number he says he has refused.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Zoran said, an assistant to Elizabeth Taylor
phoned him to ask if the star could order some clothes. Zoran
recounted the conversation in a heavy Balkan accent (despite having
lived in this country 30 years). He recalled the underling asking:
`` `But why Zoran doesn't want to speak to Elizabeth Taylor? Every
designer in the world wants to speak to her.' I said, `There's
always a first time.' She also wanted wholesale.'' The memory of
this all-too-common request brought a gale of laughter through
Zoran's iron-gray beard, which jiggles from his face like an
eccentric Brillo pad.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can somebody who makes a lot of money ask that?'' he said.
``If I want something from Tiffany, do I call and ask for
wholesale? How?''
</P>
<P>
   Although Zoran is outgoing and ruthlessly funny and can weigh in
on a variety of topics (``His politics are almost to the right of
Beowulf,'' said the architect Hugh Newell Jacobson, who is
designing his headquarters here), he and his business partner, Gary
Galleberg, a former mergers and acquisitions lawyer at Cravath,
Swaine &AMP; Moore, keep a low profile. They divide their time between
this elegant old resort community on Florida's west coast and New
York.
</P>
<P>
   But Zoran can also be found in Milan, where they have a
showroom, or in South Carolina, where he owns a plantation. There's
no telling. When Gloria Vanderbilt, a longtime client, recently
wanted to reach Zoran at his New York offices, which occupy a
building he owns in TriBeCa, she had to call the socialite Anne
Slater for the number. It's unlisted. ( Galleberg said that's just
to avoid solicitation calls.)
</P>
<P>
   Even more intriguing, Zoran and Galleberg have been talking to
Bill Blass about buying his business. The overture seems absurd,
given that Zoran himself has no licenses, no perfumes, nothing that
would qualify him to run a fancy Seventh Avenue house. As Galleberg
said: ``We don't operate on the cocktail circuit. We don't need
that constant schmooze factor.'' (They apparently don't need to fly
first class, either. It's coach, all the way.)
</P>
<P>
   While many of Zoran's better-known competitors are struggling to
redefine themselves in a culture that has turned stubbornly casual,
he is making millions at the one and only thing he does: fashion.
His deluxe minimalism doesn't come cheap. Put together two or three
pieces with one of his gossamer chiffon coats, and you're looking
at a $3,000 ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Galleberg declined to disclose annual sales, but conversations
with retail executives suggest that Zoran's volume is around $25
million in wholesale revenues, a number that has zoomed in the last
five years as stores like Saks Fifth Avenue and Bergdorf Goodman
(and in June, Neiman Marcus) have given his clothes a wider market.
But revenues tell only part of the story. Because Zoran refuses to
allow his clothes to be marked down, stores have an incentive to
sell them at full price. ``They love it, of course,'' said Zoran,
sitting on his patio. ``Who wouldn't take full markup?'' The upshot
is that the profit margin for Zoran's clothing is among the best,
usually neck and neck with Giorgio Armani. ``He's at the very
top,'' said Philip B. Miller, the Saks chairman, who carries Zoran
in 25 stores.
</P>
<P>
   And because Zoran and Galleberg aren't inclined to spend money
on advertising and expensive airline tickets, their profit margins
are probably above the industry's norm of 10 percent. Galleberg
declined to give specifics, but retail executives speculate that it
could be 20 percent. Galleberg's term for it was ``giant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not giant,'' Zoran interjected with a wave of his hand. ``But
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who spends time with Zoran quickly exhausts it listening
to him. He is a champion talker, with little interest in books or
television. (The last movie he said he saw was Truffaut's
``Breathless.'') And though his daily vodka intake seems enormous,
he is usually up at 7 a.m. and on the phone by 9, discussing what
sold the previous day in Boston or Beverly Hills. On this
afternoon, dressed in a white T-shirt and khaki shorts, he looks as
anonymous as any rich overachiever. Of his brand of T-shirt, he
said: ``I don't know what it is. Sears &AMP; Roebuck. How could you
wear fashion here, and why? And I hate to be stopped: `Where did
you get it?''' He frowned. ``So if someone asked you where you got
your T-shirt, and you say Sears, you close the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   And in way, that's exactly what Zoran's anonymous-looking,
logo-free clothes do: they silence the discussion about fashion.
</P>
<P>
   He inspires amazing loyalty _ when you consider some of his
imperious gestures, like installing a shower in his loft to remind
private customers he didn't approve of makeup with his clothes.
``It was there for indication,'' Zoran said. ``And, of course, who
was right? Look at Calvin, look at _ do they show jewelry or makeup
now?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vanderbilt recalled being photographed for a magazine when
one of Zoran's assistants, there to help, whispered that the red
polish on her toes was taboo. ``I can't say I took it off,'' Ms.
Vanderbilt said. ``But I did end up not wearing polish for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Coleman, the theatrical producer, has been a faithful
client for 20 years, and she rarely deviates. ``I never feel I look
as good in other designers' clothes as I do his,'' said Ms.
Coleman, who wore a white Zoran dress the night her show, ``Art,''
won a Tony. Ms. Vanderbilt gave another clue to Zoran's mystique.
She was giving a book reading at an Upper East Side book store when
he appeared. ``I was wearing, unfaithfully, an Armani suit, and
Zoran had with him this beautiful chiffon stole, amber colored. He
took it and draped it all over me so that the other outfit was
completely covered.''

   Shades of Anna Sui
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lots of designers have fragrances, but how many have
a full line of color cosmetics? There's Yves Saint Laurent. There's
Versace. And now there is Anna Sui, who is introducing her
collection of lipstick, nail polish, eyeshadow, mascara and more
Wednesday at Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   She will be there at 12:30 p.m. to show customers her wide range
of colors (51 for nails alone, including 21 shades of purple, her
favorite color). The products are scented with tea rose, one of Ms.
Sui's favorite flowers. In keeping with her rock-and-roll attitude,
the powder puffs are purple.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really wanted to do was bring fun back into makeup,''
Ms. Sui said. ``I have an obsession with buying makeup. I'll buy
something because it's an unusual color or because I like the
packaging. And I reuse the containers for jewelry.''
</P>
<P>
   The line, which has been sold in Japan since last fall, is one
of the three best-selling brands at Isetan, the department store.
</P>
<P>
   There is also an Anna Sui fragrance, which she describes as ``a
floral with an incense-y powder base, what they call a floriental
in the fragrance world.'' It, too, is purple and comes in a bottle
with a black lacquerlike frame. Fragrance prices range from $35 to
$145; makeup, from $13 to $35.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed to Paper
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sotheby's May 3 fashion sale is called ``Pulp
Fashion,'' a quizzical name until you stop to realize that paper is
made from pulp. ``The idea is anything related to paper and
fashion,'' said Tiffany Dubin, the head of the auction house's
fashion department. ``We originally called it `Paper Fashion,' but
`Pulp' gave us a little more leeway. One of the things we try to do
in each sale is have a sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   So, in addition to books, photographs and illustrations, the
auction will include items like a dress made of Bergdorf Goodman
gift cards, a jeweled shoe made of paper, a pair of Calvin Klein
briefs mounted on cardboard by Andy Warhol, cardboard replicas of
the Hermes Kelly bag, colorful paper dresses from the 1960s, men's
``chinos'' made of manila envelopes, and vintage luggage covered
with paper travel stickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the surprising lots I expect to be a killer,'' Ms.
Dubin said, ``is No. 129, a rough print of Marilyn Monroe in a
Jackie wig photographed by Bert Stern. Some negatives from the
shoot turned up a few weeks ago at the 26th Street flea market, and
everyone went wild.''
</P>
<P>
   The picture is expected to go for $2,500 to $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   Intermix Branches Out
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Intermix, the trendy boutique that started in
Manhattan's Flatiron district in 1993, attracting a customer base
of models and young career women, and branched out to upper Madison
Avenue last winter, plans to go national. Khajak Keledjian, who
owns the stores with Haro Kaldjian (they're brothers, but spell
their surnames differently), said Monday that they were planning to
open five more stores in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   The first three will be in South Miami Beach, Seattle and
Dallas. ``There will definitely be a store this fall in one of
those cities, though I can't say which,'' Keledjian said.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, the Intermix at 1003 Madison Ave. (77th
Street) gets a more sophisticated, more demanding customer than the
one at 125 Fifth Ave. (19th Street), Keledjian said. ``We get a lot
of mothers and daughters shopping together,'' he said of the uptown
location, ``and a lot of customers coming from other states. We
have a broader range of designers uptown, more higher end. There's
more attention to accessories, and the shoe area is a store within
a store.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the designers carried uptown are John Bartlett, Alberta
Ferretti, Rebecca Danenberg, Tracy Feith, Paul &AMP; Joe, and Isabel
Marant. There are accessories by Kate Spade and shoes by Jimmy Choo
and Tony Valentine.

BELLSOUTH AGREES TO ACQUIRE 10 PERCENT OF QWEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking to expand into data communications, BellSouth Corp. said
Monday that it had agreed to acquire 10 percent of Qwest
Communications International Inc., the No. 4 long-distance carrier,
for about $3.5 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is perhaps the most important strategic move for
BellSouth, one of the biggest local telephone companies in the
United States, since it split from AT&AMP;T Corp. in 1984. It is also
BellSouth's first major response to the wave of deal-making that
has swept the communications industry since passage of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth agreed to the investment as part of a broad
partnership that would give it access to Qwest's nationwide
fiber-optic network and that would give Qwest better access to
BellSouth's client base in the Southeast. In BellSouth, Qwest is
also set to gain perhaps the largest customer for its long-distance
network, while BellSouth is set to exploit Qwest's growing
expertise in offering advanced data services.
</P>
<P>
   The deal could help BellSouth retain big corporate customers
that are looking for integrated packages of local, long-distance
and data services _ packages that local carriers like BellSouth
have had difficulty providing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant step in our objective of becoming the
premier data communications provider to our customers,'' Duane
Ackerman, the BellSouth chairman, said in a statement. ``This
relationship allows our customers to enjoy the range of benefits
from a comprehensive set of Internet and broad-band digital
solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the second this year between a Bell local phone
company and a long-distance carrier. In February, SBC
Communications, which has agreed to buy Ameritech Corp., said it
would acquire up to 10 percent of the communications unit of
Williams Cos. for as much as $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the Qwest-BellSouth pact may have broader implications, and
not just because of the larger financial value. BellSouth has long
been thought of as a potential acquirer of Sprint Corp., the No. 3
long-distance carrier, and though the agreement announced Monday
does not explicitly preclude such a move, Ackerman said that his
main priority was making the alliance with Qwest a success.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Nacchio, chief executive of Qwest, said in an interview
that it was reasonable to think that BellSouth's investing in a
competing long-distance company would not help the BellSouth-Qwest
venture succeed.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the agreement, Daniel Reingold, the chief
telecommunications analyst at Merrill Lynch, released a short
report on the implications for Sprint titled ``Left Out in the
Cold?''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint shares fell $2.5625, to $97.4375. Shares of IXC
Communications Inc., another long-distance carrier that had been
considered a potential acquisition candidate for BellSouth, fell
$3.375, to $40.875.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, BellSouth shares rose 68.75 cents, to $41.875.
Qwest shares traded as high as $92.125 in the morning before
closing unchanged at $82.
</P>
<P>
   The early move in Qwest's stock appeared to reflect BellSouth's
agreement to pay $94.50 a share for its 10 percent investment in
Qwest, a premium of roughly 15 percent over Qwest's closing price
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   About 55 percent of the shares BellSouth agreed to buy, worth
about $1.93 billion, would be newly issued by Qwest. The remaining
45 percent, worth about $1.57 billion, would be sold by Anschutz
Co., Qwest's principal owner.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave Philip Anschutz, the reclusive oil and railroad
magnate, in control of about 40 percent of Qwest. Nacchio said
Anschutz had agreed to sell some of his shares partly out of a
desire to turn his paper profits into cash.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As with the other Bells, federal rules prohibit BellSouth from
selling long-distance service to its core customers until the
company convinces regulators that its local markets are open to
competitors _ a test that no Bell company has yet passed. The rules
cap Bell investments in long-distance operators at 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Qwest provides that once BellSouth wins entry to
the long-distance market, it will get a seat on the Qwest board and
the right to increase its stake in the company to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this deal, Duane Ackerman has said, `We're here to stay;
we're here to play, and we are going to be a force, not only
domestically but internationally,''' said Phil Asmundson, head of
communications and media accounting practice at Deloitte &AMP; Touche.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has invested heavily in Latin America, while Qwest has
formed a joint venture with the Dutch telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   Asmundson said he saw the deal Monday as just a prelude to a
full-blown merger between BellSouth and Qwest once BellSouth is
allowed into the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe by any stretch of the imagination that this is
it; this is just the beginning of the dance,'' he said. Qwest, he
added, ``is a company that was born and bred to be bought.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal leaves U S West as the only Baby Bell without an equity
alliance with a long-distance operation. Bell Atlantic Corp. has
agreed to merge with GTE Corp., which itself owns part of the Qwest
network.
</P>
<P>
   The Bells are allowed to sell long-distance service in
connection with new businesses like wireless phone service.
BellSouth currently uses AT&AMP;T for many of its long-distance needs,
but BellSouth said Monday that it would begin to move as much of
its traffic as was feasible onto Qwest systems.

ONCE AGAIN, EWING MISSES AND KNICKS LOSE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ In a very physical game against the Philadelphia
76ers, the Knicks were bumped and pushed three spots out of the
playoff standing Monday night with a 72-67 loss at First Union
Center.
</P>
<P>
   It was their fourth loss in a row and dropped them to .500 with
a 21-21 record. The Knicks had a chance to tie the game after
making up an 8-point, fourth-quarter deficit. But with his team
trailing by 69-67, Patrick Ewing's jumper landed off the mark with
21.8 seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was hope when Theo Ratliff missed two free throws
with 21 seconds left. But on his second miss, the rebound slipped
past Larry Johnson and made its way into the hands of Allen
Iverson, who was fouled and made 1 of 2 free throws with 16.6
seconds remaining to provide a 3-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   After a chaotic possession, Allan Houston rushed a 3-pointer
with 4.4 seconds to go. It missed badly and bounced over the
backboard. The 76ers' Eric Snow then hit two free throws to put the
game away.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, who did not score in the second half, finished 4 for 13
for 12 points. Latrell Sprewell scored 16 points and Ewing had 11
on 3-for-8 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Geiger led the 76ers with 22 points and Iverson added 20.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers were not the easy prey they had been in their two
previous games against the Knicks. Instead of falling apart every
time Iverson shimmied and shook and missed a jumper, the 76ers used
a very active and agile defense, led by the shot-blocking efforts
of Ratliff, and blended Geiger into the offense.
</P>
<P>
   The twosome propelled the 76ers to a lead in the opening minutes
of the game that they would not relinquish in the first half. To
punctuate the first half, the Knicks' defense left Iverson wide
open for a 3-pointer at the buzzer that gave the 76ers a 44-39
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers came out in the third quarter and hit the Knicks with
a couple of quick baskets to take a 48-41 lead. But then, on the
effort of two steals, a 3-pointer and a layin on the break by
Charlie Ward, the Knicks were able to make up some ground and tied
the game at 50-50 with 4:25 left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the 76ers block shots, Chris Dudley sprang up in
the paint and swatted away a runner by Larry Hughes, who had gotten
away with that shot twice before. The Knicks looked energized by
that play, but were unable to harness their energy and get off a
smart shot on their next two trips down the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Off a turnover by Sprewell, Snow launched an alley-oop from just
inside midcourt to Hughes, who fielded it in the air and turned it
into a hair-raising layup to give the 76ers a 54-50 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then off back-to-back blocks by Ratliff, one on Marcus Camby and
one on Sprewell, the 76ers were able to parlay his defense into a
56-50 lead at the end of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   This was a stark departure from the way the Knicks had
manhandled the 76ers in their first two meetings. In those games,
the Knicks compiled a combined halftime edge of 88-57 and went on
to comfortable victories.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week ago, when the Knicks were completing a three-game
winning streak with a 91-72 victory against the 76ers, Chris Childs
and Ward alternated intense defense on Iverson and held him to 4
for 16 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Iverson started the first half 5 for 11 with 14
points. Although the defense was tight on him, he was able to flash
his crossover moves and head fakes to create just enough space to
deliver.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were struggling just to breathe in the face to the
physical 76ers. They shot 35.7 percent from the field in the first
half, with Ewing (1 for 4) hurting more than helping. After a
2-for-7 beginning, Houston hit his last two shots of the half for
12 points and Sprewell came up with 8 points off the bench. The
efforts by Sprewell and Houston, plus some silly fouls by the 76ers
to put the Knicks to the line 15 times in the first half, allowed
them to stay closer than their off-kilter play would have
indicated.
</P>
<P>
   They were within 5 points at the half despite the exasperation
caused by the three blocked shots apiece by Geiger and Ratliff in
the first half. They made every layup an adventure for the Knicks,
which was part of the reason Ewing and Camby, who missed all three
of his first-half shots, were having such a difficult time
underneath the basket. The last time the Knicks played the 76ers,
Camby scored 15 off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Knicks played the 76ers, everything was going
so smoothly for them. They were riding a winning streak and feeling
confident that they had turned their problems around. But the 76ers
were the last team the Knicks had beaten entering Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   A 76ers team that had been the elixir for what had ailed them
earlier in the season would not go down so easily.

ROSKI PRESSURED BY NFL BLITZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ed Roski thought he had prepared for every
possible contingency in creating a redesigned Coliseum and
preparing a bid for a NFL expansion franchise.
</P>
<P>
   But he now realizes he didn't budget for a psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could use one right about now,'' Roski said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   As Phase II of the NFL's proposed return to Los Angeles
continues today with a visit by the league's expansion committee,
the Kings owner is having difficulty handling all of the NFL's
stressful blitzes and stunts.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL today will likely announce the New Coliseum as the site
for a team. But Roski, who literally willed the Coliseum back to
life with his support, will be kept hanging as the league goes
about hand-picking an owner or ownership group.
</P>
<P>
   The league wants to see if any other parties will come forward
with a bid, as well as a freshening of the bids by Roski and
Michael Ovitz. It could lead to an auction, ``and I don't think any
of us would have gotten involved if we knew it would come to
that,'' Roski said.
</P>
<P>
   Roski has already agreed to vacate his exclusive deal with the
Coliseum at the behest of the NFL. As personally flummoxed as he
may be, Roski's biggest concern is that the process could kill what
he's been working on for so long, the return of the NFL to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a real major problem,'' Roski said. ``There are a number
of stakes holders in and around the Coliseum that need to be
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a long list, including the Coliseum Commission, which has a
lease for the stadium through 2005; the state, which owns the land;
neighborhood business groups involved in the overall downtown
makeover; a handful of conservancies; the federal Department of the
Interior; the museums in Exposition Park; and USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, these people and relationships we've nurtured
would want to know who they're dealing with, and whether they'll be
involved in negotiations, and whether the agreement we worked out
will be honored,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty dangerous. We've worked real hard on this, and it
could potentially be a deal breaker.''
</P>
<P>
   That is especially so should the league say more public money
needs to be attached to the Coliseum deal. The project claims there
is a $348,976,000 public investment in the project. But $85 million
of that is the subjective land value which is owned by the state,
and which happens to be tied to a proposed new lease with the
Coliseum Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Another $223 million is in infrastructure (freeways, access) and
Coliseum renovations that have already taken place. There is only
$40 million of fresh public money in the deal. Stadium construction
costs are to be handled privately by Roski through a private bond
issue secured by stadium revenue.
</P>
<P>
   But every NFL stadium built or renovated in the last five years
has included a substantial financial committee from the public
sector. That would include Cleveland, Baltimore, San Diego, Tampa
and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have (that mentality) in California,'' Roski said.
``There is no way we can ask the city or state to invest in a
football stadium when there are so many other things that need to
be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was upfront with the NFL from the beginning. `We can do it
ourselves with private money.' All they have to do is look at the
Staples Center. There are a lot of minefields, but we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The expansion committee will meet this morning, then take a bus
tour of new downtown development that will end at the Coliseum and
lead into a 12:30 p.m. news conference.

 &HT;    Sparky Anderson elected to Reds Hall of Fame
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Sparky Anderson easily was the most popular, most
recognizable and most productive manager in the history of the
Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   And yet after the 1978 season, after finishing lower than second
only once in his nine years as manager and after putting two World
Series championship rings on his fingers, he was mysteriously and
unceremoniously fired.
</P>
<P>
   That was 21 years ago and Anderson never revealed why he was
pink-slipped by club president/general manager Dick Wagner, always
an ogre to Reds fans as the man who dismantled The Big Red Machine.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, during a media conference call concerning his
election to the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame by the Cincinnati
chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America, Anderson
offered his reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you now. . .why I think it happened,'' Anderson
said. ``I believe it was because I got a little stubborn, a little
bit high and mighty.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because he was loyal to his coaches and players.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the 1978 season, when the Reds were on their way to a
second straight second place finish in the National League West,
Anderson was told in San Francisco that some coaching changes were
going to be made. Anderson wouldn't name names, but insiders said
Wagner wanted to replace pitching coach Larry Shepard and third
base coach Alex Grammas, both close friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'They are not going to be made, not over me, not over
my head,''' Anderson told Wagner. ``I fought it in San Francisco
and it didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   After the season, Anderson took the Reds to Japan for an
exhibition tour and Wagner wanted to discuss coaching changes again
and Anderson told him to wait until the team returned to the United
States, ``But that it still wasn't going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   When Anderson stood firm after the trip, Wagner fired him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just fought too hard over those changes,'' Anderson said.
``They were 50 percent wrong and I was 50 percent wrong. My place
was in the clubhouse and I had no business trying to run things
upstairs. You have to cooperate and not be so arrogant. I can't
look back and blame them. I have to be honest and say I caused half
the problem myself.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Wagner also would not play the free-agent game. He
wouldn't sign free agents and he wouldn't match offers made to his
players by other teams _ pitcher Don Gullett, second baseman Joe
Morgan and infielder/outfielder Pete Rose. They all left as free
agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not competing by the (free agent) rules that
existed,'' Anderson said. ``And I was a little arrogant then
fighting for a couple of players.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Anderson was hired by the Detroit Tigers (he took
Grammas with him), where he managed for 17 years and matched his
1975 and 1976 World Series championship with a title for the Tigers
in 1984, the only manager to win the World Series in both leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be coy and say this (Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame)
doesn't mean much, but it means so much to me. . .the first place I
managed, the first big-league game I ever managed. I'm a dreamer,
always have been, but I could never dream up the great things that
happened to me in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into the Hall of Fame, well, I'll stay there an
eternity, as long as the world lasts. . .and that boggles your
mind,'' he said. ``All my relatives, for generations and
generations, will know exactly where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt when Anderson turns 70 and becomes eligible
for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, the
Veteran's committee will sweep him in on the first ballot.
</P>
<P>
   And which hat will he wear, Reds or Tigers?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still talking about that,'' Anderson said. ``But I know
one thing, (then general manager) Bob Howsam will stand next to me.
People thought he was crazy at the time when he hired me at 34 to
manage the Reds. Had he not, I might never have managed in the
major leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was 863-586 (.571) in nine years with the Reds,
2,194-1,835 (.545) for 26 years as a manager.
</P>
<P>
   He will be officially inducted as the Hall's 54th member during
pre-game ceremonies in Cinergy Field on Friday, July 16.

LUCAS, DIGITAL INNOVATORS TEAM UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Movie camera specialist Panavision Inc. is teaming
up with the Force.
</P>
<P>
   Panavision and Sony Corp. have formed a partnership to develop
digital cameras and lenses for George Lucas to shoot the second and
third ``Star Wars'' prequels, both to be shot entirely without
film.
</P>
<P>
   The companies also said that several scenes in the finished
``Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace'' were created using a
Sony digital camera and Panavision lenses as part of a ``real
world'' test of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This working relationship between ourselves, Sony and
Panavision represents a model for an industry seeking to capitalize
on fast-developing breakthroughs in digital imaging,'' said Rick
McCallum, producer of ``Episode 1'' in a statement Sunday at the
National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas is expected to start shooting ``Star Wars Episode 2'' next
spring at Fox Studios Australia for release in 2002. He had
announced earlier this year that it would be shot digitally rather
than on traditional film.
</P>
<P>
   Using digital cameras will give Lucas more flexibility in
manipulating images and creating never-before-seen shots for the
next two movies, which will revolve around the Clone Wars and
Anakin Skywalker's decision to go over to the Dark Side and become
Darth Vader.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, who also plans to use digital projectors in June for four
screenings of ``Episode 1,'' has long been an advocate for using
``electronic cinema'' to achieve the same theater-quality results.
In this case, Sony and Woodland Hills-based Panavision began work
with Lucasfilm 18 months ago on a series of tests with a filmless
camera on several ``Episode 1'' scenes.
</P>
<P>
   In a reflection of Lucas' commitment to leading-edge technology,
the scenes were transferred to conventional 35 mm film, and some
have been included in the finished film as a ``real world'' test of
the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Sony and Panavision, which first teamed in 1988 when they
developed a relay optical system for a Sony camera, said they will
give Lucas late this year the prototype of a digital
high-definition camera system specifically designed for
moviemaking. Preproduction on ``Episode 2'' is expected to begin
about the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas included an unprecedented 1,900 computer-generated special
effects shots in the coming ``Episode 1,'' due to open May 19 with
a story set 32 years before the original ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that ``Episode 1'' is the most anticipated
movie in many years, Panavision derived no benefit Monday on Wall
Street, with its stock falling 12.5 cents to $8.9375. The stock,
pushed down by the slowdown in Hollywood moviemaking, has lost
two-thirds of its value since investor Ronald Perelman took control
with a $600 million recapitalization in June.

 &HT;    O'Donnell released from Bengals
 &HT;    (EDS: This story runs in place of Bengals draft story. Slug
stays the same.)
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Quarterback Neil O'Donnell's turbulent 10-month
stay with the Bengals ended Monday when he was released by
president and general manager Mike Brown.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, who signed a four-year, $17.25 million contract in
July after getting cut by the New York Jets, beat out Jeff Blake
for the starting job during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   But he went 2-9 as the starter, and fractured a bone in his
right passing hand Dec. 6 against Buffalo. He spent the final three
weeks on injured reserve.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell became expendable when the Bengals made Oregon's Akili
Smith their top draft pick Saturday. Cincinnati has five
quarterbacks on the roster: Smith, Blake, Paul Justin, Eric Kresser
and rookie seventh-round pick Scott Covington. ``When Neil and I
talked a couple weeks ago, I told him if we drafted a quarterback
high, we would let him go,'' Brown said. ``This is what Neil
wanted. This gives him his best chance (to sign elsewhere).''
</P>
<P>
   In 13 games, O'Donnell completed 212 of 343 passes (61.8
percent) for 2,216 yards, 15 TDs and four interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just didn't work out here,'' Brown said. ``I have a hard
time saying exactly why. He didn't get an early start. It seemed
like he was never comfortable operating our system. That made it
hard for him to pick out the right receiver at the correct time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the NFL today, you can only keep so many high-priced
quarterbacks. Something had to give. By the end of the year, I
don't think anyone around here had the feeling it was going in the
right direction. We're not looking to continue that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Blake will begin the season as the No. 1 quarterback,
but anticipates Smith will push hard for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want it to be comfortable for both of them,'' Brown said.
``But they're competing, and when you compete, the pressures that
that produces will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off their fourth 3-13 record of the 1990s, the Bengals
goal is to score more points. They were outscored an average of
28.3 to 16.8 in '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL is an offensive game,'' Brown said. ``Offense and
defense are important, but the top teams today are the teams that
roll up the points.
</P>
<P>
   ``That helps their defenses. It gives them field position. It
gives them less time on the field. It gives them the advantage of
being ahead and taking chances, taking risks. All that helps a
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the way it's been around here in recent years, we haven't
be able to score enough. It's put an undo burden on our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he's pleased with his second-round pick, West Virginia
cornerback Charles Fisher, Brown will continue to negotiate with
free agents Ashley Ambrose and Ryan McNeil with the hope of adding
experience at a critical position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We filled the need,'' he said. ``We'll talk to unprotected
free agents at cornerback. But it would have to be something that
made sense for us. We're not going to overpay because we have a
sense of need.''

 &HT;    Draft makes Browns' 1999 picture a little clearer
 &HT;    By Sean McClelland
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND, Ohio _ The Cleveland Browns march into this weekend's
mini-camp with nearly 90 bodies on their expansion roster.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a fan, or even if you're head coach Chris Palmer,
that's the good news.
</P>
<P>
   Now, how many of those can play football? And how many will be
there when the NFL officially returns to Cleveland in September for
the first time since Art Modell spirited the original Browns out of
town in 1995?
</P>
<P>
   That's the mystery, and it doesn't figure to be solved until
deep into training camp, if even then.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to put the puzzle together,'' Palmer said.
``Maybe about 30 percent of our squad is clear in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the roster shapes up after the Browns made 11
selections in the NFL Draft:
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSE
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback: For now, Ty Detmer is the starter while top pick
Tim Couch learns his way around the system.
</P>
<P>
   Running back: If the season opened today, former 49ers Terry
Kirby and Marc Edwards would start. Not great, not terrible.
Missing is a third-down or change-of-pace back. Seventh-round pick
Madre Hill could find a niche here if healthy. Jerris McPhail and
six-year veteran Ron Moore add depth. Trading for Tyrone Wheatley
is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Wideouts: Leslie Sheppard, acquired from Washington, is the most
accomplished talent. Second-round pick Kevin Johnson will get every
chance to be the slot receiver and fifth-rounder Darrin Chiavarini
has the speed and hands to surprise. Freddie Solomon will
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end: Irv Smith. Solid, but no backup visible at this
point. If sixth-round pick James Dearth sticks, it will be as a
long snapper.
</P>
<P>
   Linemen: Deep enough to be ignored on draft day. Tackles are
both Browns, Lomas and Orlando. Center Dave Wohlabaugh arrived from
New England as a free agent. Jim Pyne is set at one guard spot with
fellow expansion-draft refugee Ben Cavil among those competing for
the other.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   Linemen: The signing of Derrick Alexander over the weekend means
the Browns almost certainly will employ a base 4-3 scheme. Palmer
envisions Alexander and John Jurkovic at the tackle spots with
Hurvin McCormack and Roy Barker on the outside. Could be worse.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers: Chris Spielman is the middle linebacker if his body
holds up. Elijah Alexander is a weakside candidate, although he's
injured and will miss mini-camp. On the strong side, a training
camp battle is shaping up between John Thierry and second-round
pick Rahim Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerbacks: Antonio Langham and Corey Fuller should be solid,
but Daylon McCutcheon, a third-rounder from USC, won't be held back
for long.
</P>
<P>
   Safeties: Marquez Pope, at free safety, and University of
California draftee Marquis Smith, a run-stuffing strong safety,
appear to be the best bets at this point.
</P>
<P>
   SPECIALISTS
</P>
<P>
   Place-kicker: Untested Phil Dawson can expect training-camp
competition from a number of free agents, their identities to be
determined.
</P>
<P>
   Punter: Eight-year veteran Chris Gardocki has this spot nailed
down.

KINGS FIRE ROBINSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Just before the start of the season, the
Kings offered Larry Robinson a two-year contract extension, a
reward for his work in 1997-98, when he'd been a finalist for the
Jack Adams Award as the NHL's Coach of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, in a move that to this day puzzles General Manager
Dave Taylor, declined to sign the extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult to understand why he didn't accept it,''
Taylor said Monday afternoon. ``But Larry, he'll tell you, is a
day-to-day person.''
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday, Taylor had concluded that a day-to-day person was the
wrong person for this job and that Robinson had run out of days.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson coached Sunday's season-ending 3-2 loss after being
told by Taylor he would not be back for a fifth season, and Monday,
the Kings officially announced that the contracts of Robinson,
assistant coaches Jay Leach and Rick Green, and goaltending
consultant Don Edwards would not be renewed. Taylor added that he
has yet to begin what promises to be an exhaustive search for the
right coach to lead the Kings into the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not an easy decision and it was not an easy process,''
Taylor said. ``Larry made it easier. He understands, and I think he
agreed with the decision. When I talked to him this morning, he
seemed more relieved than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, insisting he wants to coach again, said he wasn't at
all relieved at the conclusion of a four-year stint in which his
teams made the playoffs only once, didn't win a postseason game and
posted a cumulative 122-161-45 record with a rebuilding franchise,
including a 32-45-5 mark this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there would be (relief),'' Robinson said, ``but not
really. I still thought there would be a lot to be done. You want
to go out on top. This is not what I envisioned when I took the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he will compile an initial candidate list that could
have as many as 10 names on it, conduct interviews, narrow the
field, conduct more interviews, then make a decision. He said it is
not imperative that a coach be in place before the amateur draft on
June 26.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor added that he wants to hire someone with previous
coaching experience, and would not rule anyone out, including the
well-traveled and controversial Mike Keenan, who was fired earlier
this season by Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Among early candidates are two from the IHL: Long Beach Ice Dogs
coach John Van Boxmeer, who has worked with several of the Kings'
prospects, and Utah Grizzlies coach Butch Goring, who was fired as
Boston's coach in 1986 after a bit more than one season and was a
teammate of Taylor's in Los Angeles in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Said Van Boxmeer, whose team is preparing for the start of the
playoffs: ``It's not an appropriate time for me to be discussing
another job.''
</P>
<P>
   Goring also is believed to be a candidate for the New York
Islanders' job, but said of the position with the Kings,
``Hopefully, they'll put me on the short list and give me the
opportunity to take the next step. It seems like a very strong
match. Obviously, I have a lot of ties there.''
</P>
<P>
   Goring was a candidate for the Kings' job four years ago when
Robinson was hired, and turned down the Mighty Ducks' job a year
ago when he couldn't reach contract terms in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Others who may be considered are former Buffalo Sabres coach Ted
Nolan; Detroit assistant Dave Lewis, another former teammate of
Taylor's, and IHL coaches Dave Tippett of Houston and John Anderson
of Chicago. Taylor would not rule out hiring a college or junior
coach, and said he wants to see if any coaches become available
after the early rounds of the Stanley Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, several factors cost Robinson his job. Taylor said
that when Robinson questioned his coaching abilities at midseason
it sent ``the wrong message'' to the players, and Robinson's
openness and introspection in interviews the entire season also did
nothing to help his cause. Robinson also admitted that being a
stern taskmaster with players who aren't playing well is not in his
nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Larry loved the players so much,'' said left wing Luc
Robitaille, the only King who exceeded expectations this season.
``A lot of guys didn't understand how lucky we were. Usually, if
you're not playing well, you're in the stands. It didn't happen
here. I think a lot of guys didn't understand that. Maybe they
thought they were playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Kings were devastated by injuries to key
players, since-discarded free-agent pickup Steve Duchesne was a
dismal bust, and Robinson was hurt by the fact that a number of
Kings did not perform as well as they had the year before. Without
naming names, Robinson said the Kings had overrated their talent,
he said he felt his staff had done a ``great'' job with what it had
to work with, and he questioned the character of some of his
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you instill heart and drive and intestinal fortitude
into people who don't have it or don't want it?'' Robinson asked.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the 47-year-old Robinson said he hopes for another
chance, as soon as next season, to try again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'd like to get right back into it,'' Robinson said.
``I don't want to do this forever. My original plan was to retire
at 50 and start doing other things. So if I'm going to do it, I
better get to it.''

   Along with virtually every other publicly traded U.S.
pharmaceutical and biotech company, Amgen's shares fell sharply
Monday, dropping $5.875, or 8.7 percent, to close at $60.9375.
Amgen is traded on the technology-heavy Nasdaq stock exchange which
saw its index, the Nasdaq Composite, fall 5.6 percent Monday, its
third-biggest percentage drop this decade.
</P>
<P>
   For Amgen, the one-day drop followed a tough five days of
trading last week that saw its share price fall 14 percent, the
largest one-week decline in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of that, Amgen is actually performing well, company
officials say, and several industry observers expect the firm to
outperform a 44 cents-per-share consensus of analysts surveyed by
First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, people expect the earnings news to be rather
positive,'' said Caroline Copithorne, an analyst at Prudential
Securities in New York. Amgen shares were upgraded Monday by CIBC
Oppenheimer to a strong buy, from a buy rating, and analyst Michael
Sheffery of OrbiMed Advisors LLC said he expects the company to
beat expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling some of the confidence is an announcement Amgen made
last month that it would invest $100 million to develop a prostate
cancer drug it had acquired. The company noted that
higher-than-expected sales of its existing products, particularly
the anti-anemia drug Epogen, would offset the investment, allowing
it to meet analysts' full-year earnings estimates. The company is
expected to earn between $1.80 and $1.85 for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Epogen have grown faster than expected over the last
year thanks to a Clinton administration decision to ease funding
restrictions on the drug. Epogen is paid for almost entirely by
Medicare, the federal health plan for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's sell-off of Amgen and shares of other high-tech
companies comes after months of growth led by Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a big rotation out of Nasdaq names,'' Copithorne
said. ``They're all down significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Copithorne noted that Eli Lilly and Co. shares fell $9.4375 to
$72.875, Pfizer Inc. dropped $9.125 to $117.9375, and that Internet
stocks almost uniformly fell.

PROSECUTOR DEFENDS THE INVESTIGATION OF POLICE   OFFICER'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ As the latest suspect in the shooting death of an
Orange, N.J., police officer was arraigned here Monday, the Essex
County prosecutor spoke extensively about the investigation for the
first time, defending the ``diligence'' of her office's work on the
case, which has seen four people taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   One of the four died while in custody and under still
unexplained circumstances, and another was charged but eventually
exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Patricia Hurt, acknowledged that the April 8
death of the officer, Joyce Carnegie, had aroused ``high
emotions,'' but she praised the police department's work despite
allegations that those emotions led to an excessive use of force in
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt insisted that her office had ``strong evidence'' from
witnesses' descriptions that led to their first, mistaken arrest of
Terrance Everett for the slaying. The witnesses, she said, had
identified photographs of Everett as the man who had committed
three robberies on the night that the officer was killed. As a
result, Ms. Hurt said, authorities had no choice but to arrest him
on April 10 and formally charge him with murder on April 12. He was
released four days later.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth person taken into custody after the shooting, Condell
Woodson, 25, was arrested on Saturday in Newark. Monday he waived
an appearance before Judge Betty Lester at his arraignment in Essex
County Superior Court on murder, robbery and weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, from the Essex County public defender's office,
entered a plea of not guilty. Lester ordered that he remain held on
bail of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Ms. Hurt said at a news conference in her office
here, it was her office's investigation of the account from
Everett's lawyers and relatives of his whereabouts at the time of
the shooting that led to his exoneration. Ms. Hurt stopped short of
apologizing to Everett.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is regrettable what happened to Everett,'' she said. ``But
four or five days to exonerate Everett is not a very long time as
far as this office is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett has said he was hit in the face when a task force made
up of state troopers, federal agents, Orange police, East Orange
police, Essex County sheriff's deputies and investigators from the
prosecutor's office burst into his home to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Ms. Hurt denied that officers used excessive force, but
she added that she had taken steps to insure that the state would
investigate Everett's charges of mistreatment and that she had
asked that the state's division of criminal justice supersede her
office and conduct the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Another man caught up in the police net died while in police
custody. Ms. Hurt said that her office was still investigating the
arrest of that man, Earl Faison, 27, who, according to reports in
The Star-Ledger of Newark, died of a seizure on the night of April
11 while in police custody. Faison's relatives have said the police
beat him.
</P>
<P>
   Faison had been stopped while riding in a taxicab near the scene
of the crime. He matched a description of Carnegie's killer, Ms.
Hurt said Monday. Faison has been cleared of any involvement in the
shooting, she said, as has James Coker, 29, a Newark man who was
also picked up because he fit witnesses' descriptions of the
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt was unable to explain why investigators had picked up
Faison and Coker if her office had such strong evidence of
Everett's guilt. She said the arrests were part of a ``two-pronged
investigation,'' in which her office was checking Everett's account
of his whereabouts and trying to build a case against a murder
suspect at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had probable cause to arrest him,'' she said, referring to
Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Among those circumstances was verification of statements by
Everett and his wife that during the approximate time of the
officer's shooting they were eating hamburgers at a restaurant less
than a mile from the scene of the shooting and at an automatic
banking machine. Computer records of the transactions helped
confirm their account. In addition, Everett passed two lie-detector
tests shortly after he was taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   She said that work in checking his account had been delayed
because ``investigators had been up three or four days going
nonstop on the case and I had to give them a rest.''
</P>
<P>
   She denied widespread reports that her investigative staff was
deeply divided through last week on who should be charged in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The Essex County sheriff, Armando Fontoura, who joined Ms. Hurt
in the news conference, also defended the investigators and
insisted that they had not been ``overzealous,'' as many Orange
residents have charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cops were not overzealous and we could have sat back on our
laurels and gone out to play golf after we had Everett,'' he said.
``But we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt added, ``Sometimes justice calls for an arrest and
sometimes justice calls for release.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Perhaps to emphasize that she believed they finally had the
right man, Ms. Hurt, who had sounded confident of Everett's guilt
after his arrest, described the evidence against Woodson in some
detail.
</P>
<P>
   A gun that was found near the crime scene and linked to the
slaying of Carnegie was vital to the case against Woodson. Willie
Brownlee, assistant special agent in charge of the New York office
of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, who also joined Ms.
Hurt in discussing the case Monday, said that within 24 hours of
the shooting the agency had traced the gun to a transaction in
Butler, Ga. The town, in west central Georgia, is about 45 miles
northwest of Cordele, Ga., where Woodson had lived before coming to
East Orange about a month ago to visit relatives.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that the witnesses to the robberies who had
identified Everett as the man with a bald head and goatee had
subsequently identified Woodson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence in this case is strong,'' she said. ``But we are
continuing our investigation.''

AT ABORTION PROTEST, POLICE AND MEDIA OUTNUMBER DEMONSTRATORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, N.Y. _ Braving numbing rain and whistling winds, more
than 80 abortion protesters fanned across the suburbs of Buffalo
Monday morning in the second day of a highly publicized week of
demonstrations, delivering their message at high schools, public
thoroughfares and the area's biggest bookstore, which they said was
selling child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case on Sunday, there were no reports of violence or
arrests, only a few testy exchanges between abortion-rights
supporters and participants in Operation Save America, the series
of events organized by Operation Rescue, the national anti-abortion
group.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic in Buffalo, not a major headache to begin with, did not
suffer, either.
</P>
<P>
   And with a fortified presence outside abortion clinics and other
locations, police officials said they did not expect much disorder
for the balance of the week, a serene contrast to the maelstrom of
1992, when more than 600 people were arrested during a series of
demonstrations against abortions called the Spring of Life.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the first two days at least, there has been little
difference between Operation Save America and peaceful
demonstrations in other cities on more mundane subjects, with
people holding homemade signs, talking among their ideological
brethren and waving to honking drivers. Little difference, that is,
except for the intense news media and law enforcement attention.
</P>
<P>
   It was only six months ago that Dr. Barnett Slepian, an Amherst
obstetrician and gynecologist who performed abortions, was killed
in his home by a sniper in a case that made national headlines and
still remains open.
</P>
<P>
   So at some locations Monday, the protesters were outnumbered by
police, or outnumbered by television reporters doing live
broadcasts, giving the whole spectacle the aura of a
much-anticipated Broadway show opening to a less-than-packed house.
</P>
<P>
   That may change on Tuesday, when the first of several
demonstrations will be held outside the Buffalo GYN Womenservices
clinic, where Slepian used to work.
</P>
<P>
   For now, advocates on both sides have been content to interpret
it all to their advantage. ``We're happy that so many of them
didn't show up,'' said Karen Nicholls, a 28-year-old administrative
assistant from Brooklyn who is taking the week off to participate
in counterdemonstrations organized by the abortion-rights group
Refuse and Resist. ``This is a very small circus. A flea circus.''
</P>
<P>
   For abortion opponents, though, the mission of Operation Save
America is not about attendance, or expectations. It is not even
really about abortion, they say; it is, instead, about
strengthening a society weakened by immorality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take a stand, and we declare this city belongs to Jesus,''
said Joe Hermiz, a minister who, with his wife, Tina, drove five
hours from Columbus, Ohio, to participate. ``I call this a
spiritual war, and that's the way the Scriptures describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   With a grab bag of issues like abortion, child pornography,
teen-age sex and school violence, Monday's activities had been
billed by organizers as a move to broaden their agenda. But with
the exception of one large sign accusing Barnes &AMP; Noble of
promoting child pornography by selling books by the photographer
Jock Sturges, most of the signs, the discussion and the pamphlets
during a long day of protests dwelled on abortion. The day was
capped by a Spring of Life reunion dinner attended by more than 200
people.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, there were the occasional flashes of
righteous passion so common to the abortion debate. At the Barnes &AMP;
Noble store, protesters clashed verbally when Rusty Thomas, a
minister who lives near Waco, Texas, spoke thunderously about
America's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are drowning in a sea of blood,'' said Thomas, his voice
slicing through the drizzling rain. He said ``evil has opened up
like a Pandora's box'' and talked about the need for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, freedom from religion!'' an abortion-rights supporter
yelled back.
</P>
<P>
   At Kenmore East High School, Bill Nelson, 18, a senior, took
exception to the graphic posters that showed the bodies of Jews in
concentration camps side by side with a picture of an aborted
fetus, and that described both as Holocausts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pro-choice!'' he yelled from a distance, pumping his fist to
the applause of some classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pro-death!'' an abortion opponent fired back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a woman's issue!'' Nelson continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, to go to bed with a guy!'' the opponent volleyed back.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 minutes later, Nelson, his ire quelled, talked about
how he was annoyed, mostly, that the protesters showed up at his
school. ``They've got no life,'' he said.

A LOOK AT THE STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the dawn of a new playoff season, we ask only
one thing of the hockey Gods.
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually, we have several requests.
</P>
<P>
   Could we please have a Stanley Cup Finals that lasts more than
the minimum four games? New Jersey beat Detroit for the 1994 Cup in
four games, Colorado swept Florida in 1995, and the Red Wings swept
Philadelphia and Washington the last two years. In the case of a
championship playoff series, brevity is not the soul of wit or the
stuff of drama.
</P>
<P>
   And while we're at it, we would like to echo the recent
sentiments of Kings president Tim Leiweke, who said he is rooting
for teams such as New Jersey and Ottawa, which have had outstanding
seasons based more on smart management than on the size of their
bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's trading deadline, the Red Wings attempted to
purchase a third consecutive title, which would make them the first
team to accomplish the feat since the New York Islanders of the
early 1980s. Here's hoping it doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we aren't nave enough to believe the unlikely event
of a Senators championship would deter future spending by wealthy
U.S.-based teams. But it would be nice to see it's still possible
to build a Cup winner by developing players and following a system.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley Cup playoffs, particularly the early rounds,
historically have been dauntingly unpredictable. Nonetheless, what
follows is a modest attempt to sort out the events of the next two
months:
</P>
<P>
   WESTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   First round
</P>
<P>
   Mighty Ducks (35-34-13) vs. Detroit (43-32-7). Season series:
Detroit, 3-1. Series outlook: The tandem of Paul Kariya and Teemu
Selanne makes the Mighty Ducks an unattractive first-round opponent
for any team. But the Red Wings simply have too much depth and too
much experience for the Ducks to conquer. The Red Wings have eight
players on their roster who had 48 or more points this season. The
Ducks have five. The longer a series goes, the more important depth
becomes. If the Ducks can get hot on the power play, however, they
will give the Wings some trouble. Prediction: Red Wings in 6.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas (51-19-12) vs. Edmonton (33-37-12). Season series:
Dallas, 3-0-1. Series outlook: The Oilers shocked the Stars in the
first round of the playoffs two years ago. It won't happen this
time. Dallas is more mature, and the absence of suspended
defenseman Derian Hatcher will be balanced by the Oilers' loss of
leading scorer Bill Guerin. The Stars allowed a league-low 168
goals. Prediction: Stars in 5.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado (44-28-10) vs. San Jose (31-33-18). Season series:
Colorado, 3-1. Series outlook: The Avalanche loaded up for the
postseason by adding Theo Fleury to an already-potent offensive
lineup. The scoring records of the Oilers of the 1980s aren't in
any danger, but at the end of the 1990s, the Avalanche is as good
as it gets when it comes to firepower. San Jose added Vincent
Damphousse for its playoff drive, and the Sharks are pointed in the
right direction for the future. But it's hard to imagine them
forcing Colorado and goalie Patrick Roy into a protracted series.
Prediction: Avalanche in 5.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix (39-31-12) vs. St. Louis (37-32-13). Season series: St.
Louis, 2-1-1. Series outlook: The Coyotes were the best team in the
league at the start of the season. They have been a sub-.500 team
ever since. The loss to a broken jaw of leading scorer Jeremy
Roenick on the eve of the playoffs is a severe blow. The Blues, on
the other hand, seem to be coming together at the right time, and
are solid at both ends of the ice, with Pavol Demitra and Pierre
Turgeon leading the way offensively and Al MacInnis and Chris
Pronger fortifying the defense. Prediction: Blues in 6.
</P>
<P>
   Second round
</P>
<P>
   Colorado vs. Detroit. Series outlook: This will be memorable,
great players and two teams that hate each other, which is what
playoff hockey is all about. Colorado, however, has the better
goaltending and is a bit deeper offensively. On the other hand,
Detroit has a better cast of role players. Flip a coin to guess
who'll win this series. Prediction: Avalanche in 7.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas vs. St. Louis. Series outlook: The Stars will regain
Hatcher's services for the series, and he will be useful because
the Blues have some dangerous offensive weapons and are a
well-balanced team. The series will have added intrigue because
Dallas' Brett Hull will be facing his former team. Prediction:
Stars in 5.
</P>
<P>
   Conference finals
</P>
<P>
   Dallas vs. Colorado. Series outlook: The Avalanche will be at a
disadvantage at the start of this series after surviving an
exhausting and emotionally-draining battle with the Red Wings. This
will be the ultimate test for Dallas' defense, but the Stars begin
this series with two games at home and the chance to put the weary
Avalanche in an instant hole. Prediction: Stars in 7.
</P>
<P>
   EASTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   First round
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey (47-24-11) vs. Pittsburgh (38-30-14). Season series:
New Jersey, 4-1. Series outlook: The disciplined Devils were
shocked in the first round last year, but they have become a more
complete team under first-year coach Robbie Ftorek. The Penguins
can be sloppy defensively, and even though they have the reputation
of having an explosive offense because of the presence of NHL
scoring champion Jaromir Jagr, New Jersey actually scored six more
goals than Pittsburgh this season. Prediction: Devils in 5.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa (44-23-15) vs. Buffalo (37-28-17). Season series: Ottawa,
1-0-4. Series outlook: Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek is the great
equalizer, though his late-season groin injury adds a note of
concern. The Sabres finished with 12 fewer points than the
Senators, but allowed four fewer goals. Ottawa's rise this season
has been a great story, but in what should be a low-scoring series,
it's hard to pick against Hasek. Prediction: Sabres in 7.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina (34-30-18) vs. Boston (39-30-13). Season series:
Boston, 2-1-1. Series outlook: Playoff hockey arrives in North
Carolina and it will be interesting to see if anybody cares. The
Hurricanes have the third seed in the Eastern Conference and
home-ice advantage because they won the Southeast Division, but
they actually finished with five fewer points than Boston. Nobody
said life is fair. Neither team is overwhelming, but the Bruins'
playoff experience, the outstanding play of former Kings goalie
Byron Dafoe and the coaching of Pat Burns make Boston a clear
favorite. Prediction: Bruins in 6.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto (45-30-7) vs. Philadelphia (37-26-19). Season series:
Philadelphia, 3-1. Series outlook: At midseason, the Flyers looked
like the team to beat in the East. But with Eric Lindros gone
because of his collapsed lung and with Mark Recchi sidelined with
post-concussion syndrome, the Flyers are ripe. Toronto is not great
defensively, but with Mats Sundin leading the way the Leafs had the
league's highest-scoring offense. Toronto's Curtis Joseph also has
the edge in goal over the Flyers' John Vanbiesbrouck. Prediction:
Maple Leafs in 5.
</P>
<P>
   Second round
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey vs. Buffalo: Hasek and New Jersey's Martin Brodeur
met in a playoff series five years ago, with the Devils prevailing
in seven games. In five of the seven games, the winning team scored
two or fewer goals. Expect a similar series. Once again, New Jersey
has the better cast in front of its goalie, and this time, the
series should be shorter, though perhaps no higher-scoring.
Prediction: Devils in 6.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto vs. Boston: The Bruins end the Maple Leafs' surprising
season and continue their own surprising run. Boston has the
defense and goaltending to shut down the high-scoring Leafs, and
the Bruins have enough offense to puncture Toronto's unsteady
defense. Boston won the season series, 3-1-1. Prediction: Bruins in
6.
</P>
<P>
   Conference finals
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey vs. Boston: How do you stop the Devils? It's tough,
because they have four players who scored more than 20 goals this
season and 13 who scored at least 11, nearly twice as many
double-figure goal scorers as the Bruins. Couple that with New
Jersey's solid defense and it will be a tough combination to beat,
unless Dafoe is sensational. Prediction: Devils in 5.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Cup Finals
</P>
<P>
   Dallas vs. New Jersey: By the time these teams meet in the
finals, it will have been nearly seven months since they last faced
each other. In the one-game season series, the Devils recorded a
5-2 victory in Dallas. That game means nothing now. Neither does
the Stars' home-ice advantage. New Jersey won a record 28
regular-season road games. These are two complete teams that play
solid defense and are deep offensively. The important thing is that
after four straight sweeps, the Stanley Cup Finals will finally be
worth watching again. Prediction: New Jersey in 7.

PROFESSOR AWARDED PRESTIGIOUS GRANT TO WRITE ABOUT NAVAJO HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Navajo people do not dwell on their past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's done, gone,'' one Navajo woman says.
</P>
<P>
   So it is left to others to chronicle the story of a culture that
has survived where others have failed, a culture once thought
doomed by the incursion of European settlers.
</P>
<P>
   But as Navajos themselves have declared, their society is not a
museum piece locked in the 19th century. It evolves. It progresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred years ago, no one predicted there would still be
Indian communities,'' says Arizona State University history
Professor Peter Iverson, who has spent his academic life exploring
Navajo culture and politics. ``The story in 20th century Arizona
and elsewhere is that most people were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Long an admirer of the culture, Iverson has just been awarded a
Guggenheim Fellowship to write a comprehensive history of the
Navajo. In August, he will leave his teaching duties to conduct
interviews and research and begin writing. He'll return to teaching
in May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an important thing to do,'' Iverson says of the
book. ``I'm looking forward to it. You're appropriately humble
about taking it on. It's a big assignment, but it's an honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning a Guggenheim, which will pay Iverson about $30,000, is
equally an honor. He is only the sixth ASU faculty member to win
the prestigious award. Most recipients hail from eastern colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor for ASU,'' he says. ``You feel good about
representing the interior West.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Orlen, a poet in the Creative Writing program at the
University of Arizona, is also among this year's 179 Guggenheim
winners.
</P>
<P>
   One of almost 2,800 artists, scholars and scientists who vied
for the award, Iverson could only hope for the best after applying
last winter. When a colleague told him that winners would likely be
contacted in late February, he couldn't resist watching his mailbox
``like a hawk.''
</P>
<P>
   March blew in, and his hopes faded. He comforted himself knowing
he had received two previous awards from the National Endowment for
the Humanities. A Guggenheim seemed like a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put it on a back burner and turned off the stove,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Then, like an unwatched pot that finally boils, the letter
arrived: ``It is my privilege to inform you that you have been
named a fellow of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was absolutely thrilled,'' says Iverson, a modest man who
says he kept expecting to hear that the letter was a terrible
mistake. ``I couldn't believe it. You just can't believe your good
fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no mistake. He first shared the news with his wife,
Karen, his children _ grown and scattered around the country _ and
his mother in Menlo Park, Calif. Because his late father had also
been a university professor, she knew well the prestige of a
Guggenheim.
</P>
<P>
   When Iverson told his ASU colleagues, they applauded his
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been generous with their comments,'' he says.
``People have been kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson has written numerous books on Native Americans,
including last year's ``We're Still Here: American Indians in the
20th Century.'' He is also the author of ``Barry Goldwater: Native
Arizonan,'' a biography of the late Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   Indians, especially the Navajo, have intrigued him since
childhood. His maternal grandfather was principal at Navajo schools
in Fort Wingate and Toadlena, N.M., and Keems Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up hearing his stories,'' Iverson says. ``My interest
in the subject is personal and family related.''
</P>
<P>
   After earning his master's degree from the University of
Wisconsin in 1969, Iverson had an offer to interview for a teaching
job at Navajo Community College in Many Farms, the first tribal
college in the country. But the starving student had no money to
make the trip, and someone else got the job. As luck would have it,
that candidate withdrew, and Iverson was given the job over the
phone. He rented a U-Haul and made the trip West.
</P>
<P>
   After three years at the school, now located in Tsaile and
renamed Dine College for the word Navajos call themselves, Iverson
returned to Wisconsin for his doctorate, which he finished in 1975.
He was a visiting assistant professor at ASU for a year, then
taught at the University of Wyoming until re-joining the ASU
faculty in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Although other books have addressed aspects of the Navajo
culture, Iverson says his will be ``sweeping,'' chronicling the
history of the tribe from its migration into the Southwest around
the 14th century.
</P>
<P>
   Other histories, Iverson says, also disparage the Navajo in
focusing on their failures. He has a different perspective on the
community that is equal in size to West Virginia with an estimated
population of 200,000. It is located mostly in northern Arizona and
covers areas of northwestern New Mexico and southern Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell a story of success,'' he says. ``Navajos are
winners.''
</P>
<P>
   That success derives partly from the size of the tribe, largest
in the United States, and its geographic location _ what Iverson
calls ``a powerful landscape.'' Navajos inhabit land rich in
resources and noted for such tourist destinations as Monument
Valley and Canyon de Chelly.
</P>
<P>
   Early in their history, Navajos expanded their population by
embracing newcomers. In the 17th century, when Spaniards were
driven out of New Mexico and then returned, Pueblo people sought
refuge with the Navajo and were incorporated into the society.
</P>
<P>
   Times change, and the Navajo Nation has evolved with the times,
Iverson says. Change in Native American communities does not signal
acquiescence any more than it does in Anglo communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't consider ourselves less American than Abraham Lincoln
because we drive cars and he didn't,'' Iverson says. ``All cultures
change. Through contact and conflict, cultures are invigorated.''
</P>
<P>
   One cause for concern, however, is the decline of the Navajo
language, he says. Few Navajo young people speak their native
tongue. And fewer remain on traditional family sheep ranches,
increasingly moving into such towns as Window Rock and Chinle.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson will approach his work not only as an historian but as
an archaeologist and anthropologist as well, tracing the Navajo
roots back more than seven centuries to their origins north of
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a multidisciplinary enterprise,'' he says. ``That's
what an historian tries to do _ to make connections between
different fields.''
</P>
<P>
   His journey will take him from sources at ASU _ Native American
students and faculty members _ to the seat of the Navajo Nation in
Window Rock to the National Archives in Washington, D.C., where he
will study such documents as old treaties, correspondence and
records on education. He will study the Navajo language with ASU
graduate teaching assistant Alfred Yazzie.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to ensure responsible research, the Navajo
government asks scholars to obtain a permit before beginning a
project. In return, assistance and access to data are provided.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his research will come from materials passed down from
his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Iverson, 55, will draw on his own wealth of
knowledge gathered over decades as an Indian scholar. He promises a
book meticulously crafted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a strong responsibility,'' he says. ``I have great
respect for Navajo history. It's important to tell the story that
is respectful of tradition but that is honest _ not to say that
there are no problems but to tell the successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who takes on this task should have the right
background. It's not a book I could have written in my younger
life. This is the right time for me to do this.'' &QL;

PROSECUTORS TO PRESENT CLINIC DOCTOR'S SLAYING TO GRAND JURY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the finding of a buried rifle 11 days ago, the authorities
in the Buffalo, N.Y., area say they have gathered enough evidence
in the October slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian to begin presenting a
murder case to a state grand jury as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury has already been addressing the slaying
under laws that prohibit violence against providers of abortion.
Slepian was the mainstay of Buffalo's only abortion clinic before
he was shot to death last Oct. 23 at his home in suburban Amherst.
But the decision by District Attorney Frank C. Clark to begin
presenting evidence to a state grand jury suggests that he has
amassed enough material to support a criminal indictment for
homicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten to the point where we know what we want to
introduce before a grand jury,'' Clark said in a telephone
interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the authorities are not saying who the suspect is, all
of the attention so far has fallen on James C. Kopp, a 44-year-old
anti-abortion protester who had been traveling around the country
from demonstration to demonstration for years.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Kopp is being sought as a ``material witness'' in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said it was easier to seek extradition of an indicted
suspect from another state or a foreign country than of someone
wanted as a material witness. For now, though, that would be a
theoretical advantage since the authorities have admitted they have
no idea where Kopp is.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said there was ``no question'' that the finding of the
rifle was important in his decision to seek an indictment. The
rifle was discovered April 8 buried one foot below the ground,
about 200 feet behind Slepian's house. It is undergoing testing at
the FBI laboratory in Washington, but the authorities have said it
resembles the kind of high-powered rifle used in the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said other evidence that prosecutors might present
includes a strand of human hair found at the wooded firing site
that has a ``high likelihood'' of matching Kopp's hair and
testimony from a jogger who spotted Kopp's car near Slepian's house
at 6 a.m. ten days before the shooting. There also are videotapes
of Kopp's car crossing the Canadian border around the days _ in
1994, 1995 and 1997 _ that three Canadian doctors who perform
abortions were shot at. None of those doctors were killed.
</P>
<P>
   If a suspect is caught and charged in both state and federal
courts, a state trial would likely precede a federal one, giving
the authorities two chances to prosecute. New York State
double-jeopardy laws would make it difficult to prosecute a suspect
who had been found not guilty at a federal trial.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Denise E. O'Donnell declined to discuss what
federal charges were being pursued, but she said that in a case
like this, potential charges would be abortion-related violence,
the use of a firearm in an act of violence, crossing state lines to
commit a crime, and, if the suspect's act was tied to an
organization, violation of the so-called RICO statutes, which
prohibit an organized criminal enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, 52, and the father of four boys, was shot to death at
10 p.m. as he stood chatting with his wife in the kitchen of their
home in an affluent enclave in Amherst, which is the largest
Buffalo suburb.

REMOVE THE SILENCER ON GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Two police officers shot dead within 22 days and the
news is filled with stories about violence and lawlessness and lack
of values and urban expansion and Hollywood irresponsibility and
everything except what counts _ guns.
</P>
<P>
   I'm wondering how many good cops have to die before we can
unscrew the silencers and talk about the growing number of good men
and women suddenly moved to worship at the altar of pistol, rifle,
sawed-off shotgun, musket, mortar and howitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Is two enough?
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like, we can begin the conversation with the argument
made by the National Rifle Association each time someone wants to
talk about America's worshipful fascination with weapons.
</P>
<P>
   They say: Guns aren't the problem.
</P>
<P>
   And, they're correct. Guns aren't the problem. Gun nuts are the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is people who believe guns are the answer. People
who think the only reasonable response to violence is for more
people to have more guns.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, when Phoenix police Officer Marc Atkinson was
killed, an armed citizen named Rory Vertigan fired into the
suspects' car, wounding one of them.
</P>
<P>
   No one else was hurt, but it didn't save the officer.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a heavily armed Chandler police officer named James
Snedigar went into an apartment wearing full body armor and
expecting trouble. It didn't save him. &QL; 
What are our chances? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If someone that well-trained winds up dead, what chance does the
average homeowner with a .22-caliber pistol have? Most people say
they buy guns to protect themselves and their families. To save
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The papers are filled with their stories.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there's the one about the Phoenix teenager who
accidentally shot and killed a young nephew with a gun meant to
protect his family. Or the kid who killed a friend when his
father's gun accidentally discharged. Or the 6-year-old girl killed
by a 7-year-old brother who was playing with a rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Simply owning a gun makes you safe the way simply owning a Bible
makes you holy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why the gun nuts constantly bring up the Second
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the one that reads, in part,
``the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be
infringed.''
</P>
<P>
   It's there in plain English, they say. Gun ownership is
guaranteed. It's protected.
</P>
<P>
   And, they're correct.
</P>
<P>
   The right to own a gun isn't the problem. It's the notion that
we all ``need'' to own one.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a new idea.
</P>
<P>
   It can be traced along a row of graves stretching from here to
the invention of gunpowder. &QL; 
Theory into practice &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first time I saw the theory put into practice was 12 years
ago. It involved a fellow named Martin Olsen, an otherwise good man
who believed a pistol could solve the problem of violence.
</P>
<P>
   One day in 1987, Olsen was in the Lost Alaskan Bar in Mesa when
two men started breaking up the place.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen walked out of the bar to get a handgun he kept in the
glove compartment of his car.
</P>
<P>
   Before he got back, the two men fled the bar and drove away in a
truck. Olsen tried to shoot out the vehicle's tires, and missed.
</P>
<P>
   A lovely young woman named Susan Dina was stretched out on a
lounge chair near the pool of the Mesa Super 8 Motel, just across
the street. She lay next to her husband. The couple were in town
from Philadelphia for a friend's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   One of Olsen's bullets struck Susan Dina in the face, killing
her.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years I've spoken many times to the dead woman's
mother, Dolores Heil. Her family has never recovered, and she's
never been able to understand what she calls the ``gun-toting Wild
West'' mentality of the state where her daughter died.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if Susan had an opinion on the subject. But at
least her silence, unlike ours, is understandable. &QL;

RECRUITING RESOURCES MADE FOR PROUD PARENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parents with children playing high school sports get a bad rap,
some deserved, some not.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Howdeshell of Maryville, Tenn., is the proud parent of a
standout high school baseball player. But instead of getting in the
way of the coach _ as some parents are prone to do _ he has found a
way to be proactive in a constructive way.
</P>
<P>
   Howdeshell, who admits that he has grand plans for his son Andy
_ a collegiate baseball prospect at Maryville Heritage High School
_ created a Web site catering to parents with young athletes to
market.
</P>
<P>
   Howdeshell's effort is the High School Baseball Web
(www.hsbaseballweb.com), a one-stop resource for parents who have a
significant investment in their child's athletic future.
</P>
<P>
   Howdeshell is among many sites with this mission. Several sites,
such as Player Portfolio Website and AthleteNetwork.com, help
parents and young athletes get prepared for recruiting or choosing
the right college by assembling the right resources or providing a
service.
</P>
<P>
   Howdeshell's site is the only one known to be created by a
parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a site for players, parents and coaches to have
access to information and ideas about high school baseball ... the
college recruiting process, the pro draft, anything that they had a
question about,'' Howdeshell said.
</P>
<P>
   One example of the site's focus is a link to an article by
Baseball Parent magazine titled ``How to target market your son.''
</P>
<P>
   A message board poses such questions as: How many pitches would
be considered too many, in a week, for a 15-year-old high school
pitcher? Or, what does it mean when my son gets a letter and a
``baseball questionnaire'' from a college coach?
</P>
<P>
   Howdeshell launched his noncommercial site nearly two months ago
after scouring the Internet for recruiting information as it
pertains to baseball. At this point, Howdeshell has compiled mostly
a collection of links to articles, high school team sites and
baseball information sources. The site also lists camps and
showcases geared for high school athletes and has a message board
for baseball parents to exchange ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites have the same idea, but they take a different
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Players Portfolio Website (www.playersportfolio.com) allows high
school students to advertise their athletic resume on a personal
Web page. Their pages are indexed in a database that can be
accessed only by recruiters and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Young athletes must complete a brief online application. Upon
receipt, a representative of the Long Island, N.Y.-based site will
contact the athlete and find out what the athlete hopes to
accomplish. Athletes then pay a fee of $50 to $100 and have their
page posted with statistics and video clips.
</P>
<P>
   AthleteNetwork.com (www.athletenetwork.com) of Los Angeles
provides young athletes, parents, coaches and advisers with
resources necessary to make informed decisions. Users can retrieve
expert commentary and information on education, counseling,
parenting and sports psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond Dreams Scouting and Recruiting
(www.allstarbaseball.com), developed by Canadians Mike and Sean
Keady, offers advice to young athletes on finding scholarships and
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball Parent (members.aol.com/baseparent) mostly has
information for youth baseball, but it does have a list of
resources for parents who are looking for a college baseball
program best suited for their children.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone has been to a high school baseball game and watched _
and probably heard _ beaming parents, you will understand that
Howdeshell has cornered a market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that my Web site will give people the information
necessary to help a player achieve his goals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKING OF MARKETING: NPD Online Research of Port Washington,
N.Y., released a survey Monday that found sports sites are becoming
more important to female Web users. The major finding: 36 percent
of females (1,595 participated) who go online retrieve sports news
via the 'Net. Their favorite site: ESPN.com (42 percent).
</P>
<P>
   FANTASY HELP: For fantasy hobbyists who continue to have a life,
here is a book that should help eliminate more of it: Fantasy
Sports Online for Dummies. The guide, written by Jim Keogh and Gus
Nunziata for IDG Books Worldwide of Foster City, Calif., helps
fantasy sports players get the most out of online leagues. For
about $25, the book contains an Internet directory, explanations of
rules and procedures and a companion CD-ROM packed with several
fantasy-league programs.
</P>
<P>
   BROWNS ONLINE: The Cleveland Browns' official site
(www.clevelandbrowns.com) was relaunched less than a week ago.
Besides the standard press-guide information, it has lots of
interaction, including chat sessions, online trivia games, game-day
polls and e-mail postcards. Dawg Pound fans will be disappointed to
find they are not a part of the site.

 DAVID McCALL, 71, AND JOAN McCALL, 57, DIE IN CRASH  
(lb) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David B. McCall and Joan Mills McCall, who excelled
separately in the worlds of advertising, philanthropy and the arts,
and together as fiercely dedicated advocates for the world's
displaced people, died in a car accident Sunday while on an aid
mission in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   David McCall was 71. His wife was 57. The couple lived in
Manhattan and Bridgehampton.
</P>
<P>
   The McCalls, together with Yvette Pierpaoli, a well-known French
aid worker, and their driver, were on their way from Tirana, the
Albanian capital, to the northern town of Kukes, where tens of
thousands of refugees who have poured out of Kosovo have
congregated in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The four were driving in heavy rain when their car missed a turn
on a winding mountain road and plunged several hundred feet into a
ravine, said Dennis Grace, a vice president of Refugees
International, where both of the McCalls served on the board. All
four were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Grace said that the McCalls were among their nation's most
generous financial supporters of refugee aid. During their eight
years of involvement with Refugees International, they participated
in numerous missions to Thailand, Cambodia, Somalia and Eritrea,
among other places. They had traveled to Albania to explore the
possibility of setting up a satellite radio network that would help
refugee families separated by the chaos in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial reports referred to them as two American aid
workers,'' said Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. special envoy to the
Balkans, who is chairman of Refugees International and was to have
been succeeded in that post by David McCall later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would have liked that. They were highly successful
financially and socially. They could have lived a comfortable life
in New York with their family and friends. Instead, they repeatedly
risked their lives in Southeast Asia, Africa and the Balkans to
increase public awareness of the plight of people in need.''
</P>
<P>
   David McCall was born in New York, attended the Hotchkiss School
in Lakeville, Conn., and briefly attended Yale before serving in
the armed forces during the Korean War. He began his career in
advertising in the mail room at Young &AMP; Rubicam in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   From there, he joined Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, where he eventually was
hand-picked by David Ogilvy, the agency's legendary founder, to
succeed him as chief copywriter. At Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, McCall worked
on campaigns for Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co., Hathaway Shirts and Maxwell
House coffee, for which he wrote the tag line ``Coffee that tastes
as good as it smells.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, McCall left Ogilvy to become co-founder of an agency,
McCaffrey &AMP; McCall Inc. There he helped create campaigns for a
variety of companies, including Exxon, Tiffany and Mercedes-Benz.
One particularly memorable television commercial created by McCall
for Norelco showed Santa Claus sledding down a hill on one of the
company's electric shavers.
</P>
<P>
   ``David really supported the creative side tremendously,
oftentimes to the exclusion of the account managers,'' said Tom
Yohe, who was a creative director at the agency in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But it was McCaffrey &AMP; McCall's work for Mercedes-Benz that was
probably most influential, setting the standard for how luxury cars
are marketed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The agency was acquired by Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi in 1983. McCall
left five years later, eventually becoming a partner in the
Sawyer-Miller Group, a political and corporate communications
consulting firm in New York. At the time of his death, he was
chairman of Shepardson Stern &AMP; Kaminsky, a communications,
consulting and advertising firm based in New York that he helped
found six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, McCall exhibited a strong passion for
politics, education and human rights. In the 1960s he served on the
boards of the New York Urban League and the Congress for Racial
Equality. Later he was a founding member of the Central Park
Conservancy and of Meals on Wheels.
</P>
<P>
   He also used advertising to promote social causes. McCall helped
organize agencies around the country to create ads opposing the war
in Vietnam, a campaign called ``Unsell the War.'' He created
anti-tobacco advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But he took most pride in ``Schoolhouse Rock,'' an Emmy
award-winning series of animated educational segments aimed at
children that was shown on the ABC television network on Saturday
and Sunday mornings from 1973 to 1985 and again in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   McCall was married three times and is survived by six sons from
his first marriage, John, Peter and David Jr., all of New York
City, and William of Atlanta, Robert of Seattle and Thomas of
Easton, Md.; a sister, Margaret Wasley of Niantic, Conn., and six
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   He met his third wife at a party in Bridgehampton, and they were
married in 1978. Born Joan Partridge Mills, and known as Penny,
Mrs. McCall was born into wealth. Her mother was a member of the
Ordway family, which helped found Minnesota Mining and
Manufacturing Co., or 3M.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCall grew up in Greenwich, Conn., and attended the Ethel
Walker School in Simsbury. In addition to her refugee work, she
devoted much of her life to collecting art and supporting artists.
She served on the board of the New Museum of Contemporary Art in
Manhattan and established the Penny McCall Foundation to support
contemporary artists, especially women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   She was also a supporter of the Abyssinian Development Corp. in
Harlem and at the time of her death was working on an economic
development project in Harlem to set up an urban fashion design and
manufacturing company in association with the Thurgood Marshall
Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCall is survived by her mother, Dorothy Mills of
Greenwich; a daughter from a previous marriage, Jennifer McSweeney
Reuss of Rowayton, Conn.; and two brothers, George Mills of New
York City, and Sam Mills of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the McCalls had focused much of their attention
on the problem of land mines, which kill and maim thousands of
refugees around the world each year.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few months ago, the couple were instrumental in starting
a new organization called the Independent Demining Assessment
Center. Its aim is to bring new mine detection and removal
technology to the areas of the world that need it, said Grace of
Refugees International, which is helping to organize the center.

A NEW TRIAL FOR INDIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, April 20: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   India's divisive ethnic and regional politics have produced one
political crisis after another in recent years. Now these tensions
have caused the collapse of the Hindu nationalist government led by
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, which lost a vote of
confidence by a single vote last Saturday. The beneficiary could be
the troubled Congress Party, which has governed India for most of
the last 15 years and is now led by Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born
widow of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Even if Mrs. Gandhi manages
to form a government, the chances of it lasting very long are
considered slim.
</P>
<P>
   India can rejoice, of course, in its record of accommodating the
myriad caste, linguistic, religious and ethnic groupings that make
up its democracy. But its newest crisis threatens to disrupt
India's tentative efforts to defuse dangerous tensions with its
neighbor Pakistan. Only last week both countries tested new
missiles that can deliver nuclear weapons up to 1,000 miles from
their borders. As happened with last May's nuclear bomb tests,
India went first, and Pakistan responded to keep pace. If Vajpayee
had hoped that this latest show of bravado would shore up his shaky
coalition government, he was proved wrong almost instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee spent 45 years in the opposition and barely 13 months
in power, but he made a singular mark. He sent his country down a
self-destructive path of testing nuclear weapons. More recently,
however, he met with the Pakistani prime minister, Nawaz Sharif.
There was reason to hope that, in spite of the missile tests, India
and Pakistan could make more progress toward halting the
development of missiles and weapons-grade nuclear material. Mrs.
Gandhi and the Congress Party have not been as supportive of these
efforts as they should have been.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee's government won the confidence of investors with its
commitment to expanding free enterprise. But one of its notable
achievements was shelving the virulent anti-Muslim parts of its
platform. The prime minister deserves credit for pushing back the
militants in his own coalition and denouncing the violent attacks
on Christians carried out by Hindu fanatics in the last year. In
the end, his government toppled not because of any large issue but
because of demands by one of his coalition partners, the fiery
former actress Jayalalitha Jayaram. She asked that the government
drop a corruption investigation against her in the southern state
of Tamil Nadu, and is now talking about joining up with the
Congress Party. Mrs. Gandhi would be ill advised to drop the
inquiry as a price for Ms. Jayaram's joining a Congress-led
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   No single political organization has emerged in India to prevent
the constant political jockeying of recent years. The once-great
reach of the Congress Party fractured many years ago. That the
party has turned to Mrs. Gandhi, who has no political credentials
or record, is testimony to its weak leadership. Until this week she
seemed to understand that the party needed time to rebuild its
strength and credibility before seeking to form a new government or
run in a national election. Now, thanks to Ms. Jayaram, there may
be no time for the party to get ready. India's challenge is to
prevent the present political turbulence from undermining the drive
to make peace with its neighbors and among the warring groups
within its borders. &QL;

ADVERTISING: MAKING READING COOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey may have her reading club, but other celebrities
are joining efforts to persuade more Americans to pick up a book.
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign designed to make reading cool to young people _
and, by extension, to sell more books _ the actress Whoopi Goldberg
and the talk show host Rosie O'Donnell are being featured in ads
promoting reading as hip.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign from the Association of American Publishers uses
the catchy tag line ``Get caught reading.'' It will kick off the
annual booksellers convention, Book Expo America, next week in Los
Angeles. The promotion includes ads that will run in national
magazines and newspapers through the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, publishing has done very little to promote
reading,'' said Patricia Schroeder, the former member of the House
of Representatives and president and chief executive of the book
publishers group. As part of the campaign, the association has
designated May as Get Caught Reading Month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Caught Reading Month is directed at infrequent or lapsed
readers and will serve as a surprising, eye-catching reminder of
the joys of reading,'' Ms. Schroeder said, ``particularly among 18-
to 34-year-olds who often don't make time for books when the
Internet, television and so much other media compete for their
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schroeder cited industry statistics showing that adults 55
and older account for 32 percent of book purchases in the United
States while people younger than 35 buy only 20 percent of the
books sold.
</P>
<P>
   The ads that will try to increase the number of young book
buyers show Ms. Goldberg reading ``Peter Pan'' and Ms. O'Donnell
reading ``The Bean Trees,'' by Barbara Kingsolver. The ads, created
by Ogilvy &AMP; Mather New York, part of the Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide
unit of WPP Group PLC, are intended to communicate a love of books
and to promote the pleasures of reading.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, Ms. Schroeder said, is to do what milk producers did
by putting milk mustaches on everyone from Spike Lee to Melanie
Griffith _ use star appeal to reach a specific audience without
being preachy.
</P>
<P>
   The featured celebrities in the publishers group's campaign
chose the books they were photographed reading but were limited to
backlist titles to avoid giving the impression that the campaign
was intended to promote authors and publishers of new books.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which has been endorsed by the main publishing
houses, including Bertelsmann's Random House, Viacom's Simon &AMP;
Schuster and Time Warner's Warner Books, represents a collective
effort involving companies representing virtually every aspect of
the book industry. Businesses donated everything from the paper for
15,000 posters and bookmarks to the printing. Ogilvy &AMP; Mather
volunteered the creative work, and photographers donated their
photos of the celebrities. Ms. Goldberg and Ms. O'Donnell also
volunteered their services.
</P>
<P>
   ``A national book campaign sends an overwhelmingly positive
message throughout this country and is long overdue,'' said Mel
Parker, immediate past chairman of the publisher group's trade
executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the donated production work, magazines and newspapers
provided free space for the full-page ads. They range from People
magazine and Newsweek to USA Today and The New York Times Book
Review. Other publications include George, Business Week, Reader's
Digest and Disney magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The booksellers, who would be among the biggest beneficiaries if
more people read more often, got involved, too. Barnes &AMP; Noble,
Borders and other bookstores will promote the campaign with window
displays and posters as well as with bookmarks and shopping bags
displaying a ``Get caught reading'' logo. Some will hold special
events based on the theme.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the broad-based support for the project overwhelming,
Ms. Schroeder said, ``It will benefit everyone involved, not to
mention all those people who are inspired to pick up a good book.''
</P>
<P>
   She initially proposed the idea of such a project to the
publishers' association board more than a year and a half ago. At
the time, though, it was greeted with skepticism because some
members were concerned about how the group would pay for such a
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But as interest in it grew, and the donations began trickling
in, the board decided to back the project and set out to make it a
reality. Now, it is likely to be expanded into an annual event in
which the ads will be updated with new celebrity endorsers. For
next year, the actor Bill Murray is already scheduled to be a
celebrity endorser, though it has not been determined which book he
will be photographed reading.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Schroeder is walking her own talk. She just completed
``Charming Billy'' by Alice McDermott.

ADAM GUETTEL'S `MYTHS AND HYMNS' SONG CYCLE PLUMBS DEPTHS OF
PSYCHE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LAFAVE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a time when everything's been done, the only possible
artistic shocks will issue from pure talent burning its own,
strange light.
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, get ready for a big shock.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Guettel's ``Myths and Hymns'' is a theatrical song cycle
that burrows deep into the human psyche and finds all sorts of
politically incorrect things there. It's an unsettling spiritual
quest shaped as a series of song experiences of astonishing beauty.
</P>
<P>
   I have a special attachment to this work. After a brief
telephone interview last year with Guettel regarding his earlier
musical, ``Floyd Collins,'' he invited me to the production of his
latest, ``Saturn Returns,'' at the Public Theatre in New York. It
turned out that the show's opening preview coincided with one of
only four nights I planned to spend in New York for all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   So I went. But I wasn't prepared for what I was about to hear.
</P>
<P>
   One night in a bookstore, Guettel had discovered that a volume
of ancient Greek myths and a 19th-century Protestant hymnal were
saying the same things. Icarus sought to rise heavenward, and so
did Christians. Pegasus threw its rider for hubris; prideful
Christians were thrown down, as well.
</P>
<P>
   In response to this insight, Guettel did what any theatrical
songwriter would have to do: write songs. The lyrics of some he
adapted from the hymns. Others he wrote himself based on the myths,
and for two humorous numbers he asked lyricist Ellen Fitzhugh to do
the verbal honors. He set the whole to music as a themed song cycle
_ a group of songs with an implied central character and point of
view, exploring an idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturn Returns'' had no dialogue and was minimally staged. It
relied solely upon the songs to tell the story of a soulful search
and its intersection with two great streams of thought: Greek
mythology and Christian theology.
</P>
<P>
   The title originated in a quote from a Renaissance priest and
neo-Platonist, Marcilio Ficino: ``Very often, therefore, in human
affairs we are subject to Saturn, through idleness, solitude or
strength, through Theology and more secret philosophy, through
superstition, Magic, agriculture and through sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this wasn't your average pop musical.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with its title changed to ``Myths and Hymns'' (a mistake in
my opinion, the new title being too literal), this cycle is out on
a Nonesuch CD that captures all of the urgency and a great deal of
the excitement I remember from that first night. Many of the
Public's cast members are included, although the biggest change is
that Guettel himself now sings the part of the central protagonist.
He is very expressive, very capable. Musical theater composers are
not supposed to be able to sing this well, but Guettel does.
</P>
<P>
   Making guest appearances on the disc are Mandy Patinkin, who
sings a hilarious Sisyphus song (this Sisyphus is a dogged
pragmatist who believes in try, try again to the point of being a
fool); Billy Porter, who sings on two tracks; and ``Ragtime'' star
Audra MacDonald, who sings the buzzing part of the gadfly who bites
Pegasus.
</P>
<P>
   The score is complexly beautiful, with chiseled lyrics and music
distinguished by the sort of subtle harmonic changes that are rare
in contemporary pop music. It ``isn't'' contemporary pop music, of
course; it's a musical theater piece. But it has a contemporary
feeling, and here and there it salutes such genres as gospel and
country.
</P>
<P>
   Without a plot or character-continuity, the themes of ``Myths
and Hymns'' take a while to spin out and to cohere. The following
is one possible interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist finds himself in the throes of Saturn:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know from where the hunger springs,
</P>
<P>
   ``But that it's there and that it sings of someplace far away.''
</P>
<P>
   He longs to be lifted up ``like Icarus.'' Suddenly, he becomes
the demigod who flew too close to the sun against his father's
advice.
</P>
<P>
   The songs of the myths alternate with the hymns, each pursuing
the idea of transcendance. But they follow different courses. The
myths teach lessons about tragedy. The hymns touch on tragedy, but
promise a happiness at the end, a ``gathering of the faithful,''
with ``angel bands'' by a ``crystal sea.'' None of this is touched
by irony. The longings of the hymns are taken as seriously as the
lessons of the myths.
</P>
<P>
   If the protagonist is in spiritual agony, what was its genesis?
This is supplied by the most controversial song of the score,
``Come to Jesus.'' The protagonist has fathered a child that has
been aborted. In an unflinching look at the emotional ramifications
of abortion, this duet _ ``an entire play in six minutes,'' as
playwright Alfred Uhry notes in the CD booklet _ Guettel makes
human an experience that is nearly always frozen in the jargon of
issue-oriented journalism. (The song caused audible gasps at the
Public the night I was there.)
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist has been in love. He has been Leander swimming
to Hero's lighthouse. And like Leander, he is now lost in the tide
of love. In love, of course, death seems like nothing: ``Even if I
drown here inside this wave . . . My loving you was meant to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Death's reality has now come crashing back. At the end of ``Come
to Jesus,'' the couple attempt to crown their decision to abort
their child with a traditional ``Amen,'' but in one of the most
chilling theatricalisms I've ever heard, they cannot complete the
cadence and fade out on ``Ah . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist moves on. He is surrounded by the happy sounds
of the hymns as the celebrants approach their promised land:
``There's a shout in the camp for the Lord is here.'' He cannot be
one of them. He has opted to scratch out his own salvation. And in
``Awaiting You,'' the single most haunting song of the set, the
protagonist promises he will wait for God in his own way, armed
with plenty of questions about life's injustices (``But what about
the child that cannot breathe, or the gentle sage who won't see the
age of 32?'') yet tinglingly alive with the awareness of his own
need for a noble father _ a knowledge Icarus suppressed to his
great regret.
</P>
<P>
   As the joyous hymn singers intone their arrival in the
``heavenly land'' where ``everybody likes everybody,'' the
protagonist briefly joins them. It is all too easy, however, and in
the face of existence's infinite capacity for tragedy, a little
silly.
</P>
<P>
   In a sudden rush, the protagonist sees that to be saved is to
know who you are:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the rise of Icarus. I am the fall from Pegasus. I am the
lost Leander in the tide. . . . I am Saturn purified. Once around
the sun and now at last I see it! This is what I am.''
</P>
<P>
   He accepts the ``hollow and the burn'' inside him as ``an
opening, a passageway to guide me home.'' The sound of an ``Amen''
cadence begins once more. This time, it resolves. &QL;

 &HT;    Compaq's interim leaders vow to refocus company
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Compaq Computer Corp.'s long-time chairman on
Monday defended the overall expansion strategy of ousted Chief
Executive Eckhard Pfeiffer, but criticized the Houston company's
inability to respond to changes in the PC industry and left open
the possibility that other senior officials will leave.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts, Ben Rosen, Compaq chairman
and co-founder, vowed that a three-member committee he now heads
will move quickly to ``re-energize'' Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to speed up every aspect of decision making, we plan
to anticipate and to get ahead of industry changes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen declined to comment on further management changes, but
said he left that door open.
</P>
<P>
   While Rosen criticized Compaq's ability to execute and its
slowness to respond to changes in the industry, many analysts said
they believe Pfeiffer's resignation on Sunday apparently was
prompted mainly by disappointing first-quarter earnings and the way
Wall Street was notified of the shortfall on April 9. Late that
Friday afternoon, the company released a statement that earnings
would be about $250 million, or less than half what Wall Street
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Such warnings occur occasionally, but Compaq's leadership lost
credibility, analysts say, because an earnings shortfall of that
magnitude should have been apparent and reported earlier than a
week after the quarter's end. As a result, the company's stock
plunged 23 percent on the next business day.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Compaq shares dropped another 87 1/2 cents to close at
$22.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. It had traded as high as
$51.25 back in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Investors) should take a wait-and-see attitude, because
Compaq is now being lead by a committee,'' said Lou Mazzucchelli of
the Gerard Klauer Mattison securities firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said Compaq should make radical changes in the way
it makes and sells computers to big corporate accounts, including
switching almost completely to the direct-sales model pioneered by
Dell Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the corporate side, Dell's direct model has taken over,''
said Danny Lam of Fisher-Holstein Inc., an industry research group.
``I don't see much way out but to go direct.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be a profound strategic and cultural change from
Compaq's traditional system of relying on resellers to sell and
install its systems in the offices of big corporate accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen reiterated Compaq's support of the so-called indirect
channel even while the company tries to expand its direct business.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen, 65, who was the original venture capital investor in
Compaq in the early 1980s, is the acting CEO. Joining him on the
committee are directors Robert Enloe III, 60, and Frank Doyle, 67.
None of the three are employed directly by Compaq. Pfeiffer was the
only Compaq employee on the board, a position he also resigned from
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer built Compaq from a PC company with $3.3 billion in
revenues in 1991 when he became CEO to a complex global computer
systems enterprise with revenues of about $40 billion. He has not
said publicly what his next move will be.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the executive committee, with Rosen acting as
interim CEO, faces daunting challenges in addition to responding to
growing acceptance of the direct model.
</P>
<P>
   Art Russell of the Edward Jones securities company in St. Louis
said Compaq is still struggling to combine Digital Equipment
Corp.'s product-ordering and inventory systems with its own. Two
systems delay or distort the information from customers that Compaq
executives need to track sales and forecast demand, Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Compaq, which helped launch the market for sub-$1,000
PCs, is not efficient enough to compete with low-cost computer
makers like eMachines Inc., which is rapidly gaining market share
with PCs selling for $500 or less, said Lam of Fisher-Holstein.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said Compaq has begun a worldwide search for a new CEO. In
the inevitable speculation about who will replace Pfeiffer, the
names of Dell Vice Chairman Kevin Rollins and Chief Financial
Officer Tom Meredith were offered by analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be trying to get ahold of Rollins,'' said Don Young of
Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my druthers, I'd have Tom Meredith,'' added Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, through a spokesman, declined to comment on the
speculation.

 &HT;    Finance Committee passes Senate budget proposal
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Moving the session's most important bill another
step forward, the Senate Finance Committee on Monday approved its
version of the state's budget for 2000-2001, including new money
for schools, tax cuts and state employee pay raises.
</P>
<P>
   Though lawmakers and Gov. George W. Bush have many things they
want to accomplish before the session ends May 31, passing a
spending plan is the top priority for each Legislature and is the
main reason lawmakers gather every two years.
</P>
<P>
   The full House approved its version of the budget last week,
proposing $97 billion in spending and leaving more than $700
million available for other things such as sales and business tax
cuts and the state's savings account.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's version of the plan proposes $98.4 billion in
spending. After the full Senate adopts the Finance Committee's
proposal, representatives from both chambers will gather in a
conference committee to resolve the differences. The House and
Senate must pass the same version of the budget before it can go to
Bush. He has the power to veto portions of the plan, but cannot add
any money to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a good product,'' Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount
Pleasant, said before the committee he heads voted 11-0 to send its
substitute for House Bill 1 to the full Senate. ``It's a product we
can take to conference proudly.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the House version of the bill, the Finance Committee put
much of the proposed revenue growth over the current $88.5 billion
state budget into education. Public schools would get $29.6 billion
under the Senate bill, nearly $3 billion more than the current
$26.7 billion being spent to help educate Texas school children.
The House version of the bill would spend $30.3 billion on public
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we put our gold where our hearts ought to be,''
Ratliff said, referring to new money for schools, children's
protective services and children's health care.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill also contains $428 million for state employee
pay raises. That would equal a roughly 3 percent raise for all
employees, including nonfaculty workers at state colleges and
universities, Ratliff said. The House version did not contain a
general state employees' pay raise, but did leave room for public
school teacher pay raises to be determined by the House Public
Education Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Both proposals accommodate Bush's top priorities of teacher pay
raises, forcing cuts to local school property taxes by spending
more state money on public education and cutting some consumer and
business taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff said the Senate bill covers the state's needs, but
doesn't do as much as he and others would like.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander earlier this year said the
state has $94 billion for the 2000-2001 budget years, which begins
Sept. 1. That did not include an estimated $3.3 billion expected to
be left from the current budget or more than $1 billion from the
first payment to the state by the tobacco industry, under terms of
its lawsuit settlement.
</P>
<P>
   As has happened in the past, Rylander is expected to announce
that more money is available for the 2000-2001 budgets. As of last
week, however, Rylander said she still was unaware of any
additional money.
</P>
<P>
   With money from the state's $17.3 billion tobacco settlement
rolling in, both versions of the budget contain a new section to
clearly show where that money is going. Much of it would be used to
create an endowment for an anti-smoking campaign, while part of it
would go to help a teachers' insurance program.
</P>
<P>
   Of importance to Austin, the Senate bill contains $5 million for
the state to purchase 282 acres at Robert Mueller Municipal Airport
after it closes. The land is expected to be used for state office
buildings, and the city is expected to use money from the deal to
help redevelop the area after Austin-Bergstrom International
Airport opens this summer.

FACELIFT TO BEGIN AT SANTA ANITA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ The sea foam green and pale yellow grandstand
at Santa Anita Park has seen better days.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the wood and steel pavilion was packed
with eager race fans willing to plunk down a $2 bet on a Citation
or a Seabiscuit or a John Henry. There was a time when a tout with
holes in his shoes could rub elbows with movie stars and captains
of industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hot, humid and smoggy though it was, Monday marked the last day
of that bygone era.
</P>
<P>
   This morning the venerable race track will begin a metamorphosis
as new owner Frank Stronach implements his plan to remake the track
into an entertainment facility and usher in a new era in Southern
California horse racing. When Stronach's epic plan is complete, the
only recognizable thing at Santa Anita may be the San Gabriel
Mountains towering over the backstretch as silent reminders of the
giants that once raced here.
</P>
<P>
   Today the misty memories of 64 years will be swept away like the
cobwebs hanging in the high iron rafters. Work crews will begin a
non-stop reconstruction scheduled to end just in time for the Oak
Tree meet Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take on a whole new look Tuesday,'' said Craig
Luskey, a construction supervisor with Pave West. ``And by Friday
it will look totally different.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the $18 million first phase of Stronach's
multi-million renovation plan will remake the grandstand and tiled
track apron. The project also includes moving a barn area to the
north parking lot and constructing a new dining room and dorms for
backstretch workers.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Stronach planned to move the walking ring to the
front of the grandstand and eliminate the downhill turf course. He
has since scrapped both plans, much to the relief of veteran
track-goers. After all, both sites are steeped in the tradition and
lore of Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place does need some renovation,'' said Dr. Larry Samovar,
a San Diego State University professor and part-owner of Academic
Farm stables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing stays the same,'' Samovar lamented. ``I guess like
anyone else, though, the older I get the more I dislike change.''
</P>
<P>
   A change that particularly disturbs Samovar is the planned
makeover of box seats just below the glass-windowed press box.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my fellow owners has had an entire box for years,''
Samovar said. ``When this renovation came up he was never consulted
and has yet to be told what will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some younger race fans don't care about the planned changes.
Many say they are long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the '90s,'' said Enrique Bradley, 31, of Burbank. ``This
place is one of the prettiest tracks I've been do. It could use a
little upgrading though.''
</P>
<P>
   One immediate concern of Jessica Adkins, 27, of Glendale, was
the track's food service.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to bring young people in, they need to have
healthier food choices,'' Adkins said. ``It shouldn't be just hot
dogs and roast beef sandwiches.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that won't change anytime soon is the racing. Monday
there was plenty of that _ 10 races in all, including the $75,000
Santa Paula Stakes, the $100,000 Valiant Pete Handicap and the
$75,000 Bertrando.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect Six, a 5-1 shot, came out the winner in the four-horse
Santa Paula. The 3-year-old, ridden by meet champion David Flores,
paid $11.40 and $3.60.
</P>
<P>
   In the Valiant Pete, Enjoy the Moment was the winner. Trained by
Bill Spawr and ridden by veteran Laffit Pincay Jr., Enjoy the
Moment paid $7.20, $4.20 and $3.40.
</P>
<P>
   Vetheuil took the Bertrando and paid $22.40, $11.40 and $6.40.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The 84-day meet that ended Monday had its share of bright
spots. For the second straight year, both attendance and overall
handle were up.
</P>
<P>
   The meet had an average daily handle of $11,830,250, a 1.55
percent increase over 1997-98. The total handle was $993,740,990.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Anita Handicap and the Santa Anita Derby each brought
in more than $24 million.
</P>
<P>
   As for attendance, the daily average totaled 12,482 on track _ a
1 percent increase over last year, which was also up 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Top guns: Flores, with 75 wins, won the meet riding title, his
first ever at Santa Anita.... Bob Baffert led all trainers with 42
wins from 172 starters.
</P>
<P>
   Top horses: Reporters and handicappers polled by Santa Anita
chose Free House as Horse of the Meet. General Challenge, winner of
the Santa Anita Derby, was voted 3-year-old colt of the meet.
Excellent Meeting was voted 3-year-old filly of the season.

NATO ACKNOWLEDGES CIVILIANS MAY HAVE BEEN KILLED IN BOMBING RAIDS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout)  (sw) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDONr   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO acknowledged for the first time on
Monday that it had bombed two separate groups of vehicles last week
near a Kosovo town, Djakovica, and might have killed civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, NATO has only acknowledged that its planes
accidentally bombed a tractor northwest of Djakovica. But Serbian
authorities and Kosovar refugees have insistently reported allied
hits along the road southeast of Djakovica, putting NATO
credibility to a severe test.
</P>
<P>
   Providing its first comprehensive briefing on the attacks, in
which the Serbs claim that 74 civilians were killed, NATO officers
said their pilots, flying at high altitude, had been convinced they
were striking only military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But as the raids proceeded, allied officers at a command post in
Italy became concerned that fleeing refugees might be in the second
group, a huge convoy of more than 100 vehicles southeast of the
town. Their suspicions were aroused after NATO intelligence experts
warned that Serbian forces do not generally travel in such long
columns.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of OA-10 observation planes were quickly dispatched.
Using binoculars, the pilots reported that civilian vehicles
appeared to be interspersed with the military ones, and the attacks
were halted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we know from the debris that the Serbs showed is that
some civilians died there and that there is the possibility that
NATO aircraft were the cause,'' said Brig. Gen. Daniel Leaf, the
American commander of an air wing at Aviano, Italy, who led the
official NATO inquiry into the episode.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's briefing demonstrated the difficulties of identifying
targets from high altitude over a region where Serbian army and
police forces have been driving civilians from their homes and
often herding them down roads. Allied planes have spotted Serbian
tanks concealed next to ruined homes, and Serbian soldiers have
reportedly used tractors and other vehicles as well as military
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's assessment was also an important political test for the
alliance. Since the air strikes against the convoys, on April 14,
and the reports of civilian casualties, NATO spokesmen have been on
the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   This was a result not only of the insistent Yugoslav charges,
which Belgrade sought to reinforce by organizing visits to the
scene by reporters; it was also a result of contradictory
statements by the NATO commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, and
conflicting accounts of the raid by the Pentagon and the alliance.
The Yugoslavs continue to accuse NATO of killing civilians in
places NATO said it did not bomb.
</P>
<P>
   NATO sought to answer its critics on Monday by releasing a flood
of information about aircraft patrols, laser-guided bombs and even
conversations between the pilots and airborne controllers. NATO
officials said information was not released sooner because they had
to interview pilots, gather intelligence information and analyze
television broadcasts to determine what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   An excerpt was drawn from a conversation between an airborne
command post, referred to in military parlance as AB-triple-C, and
an F-16 pilot attacking the convoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just received word that this is a VJ convoy,'' the command
post told the F-16 patrols, using the acronym for the Yugoslav
army.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of bad weather and frustrating attempts to uncover
hidden Serbian armor, the pilots thought they had stumbled on a
bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great!'' responded one of the pilots. ``AB-triple-C, I want as
many fighters as I can get, now.''
</P>
<P>
   Important questions still remain, however. One is how many
civilians were killed; Leaf said reporters taken to the site saw
only about 20 victims.
</P>
<P>
   Another is whether they were killed by allied planes or by
Serbian artillery or even Serbian aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   And another is whether the allies can reduce the risk of hitting
civilians without hampering their attacks on Serbian forces. There
is also the question whether it is possible to dependably
distinguish civilian from military targets at an altitude of 15,000
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf said the episode began about 12:30 p.m. local time when a
pair of U.S. F-16's saw Albanian villages being set on fire north
of Djakovica. Their call sign was Bear 21. The episode was first
documented last week at NATO.
</P>
<P>
   A pilot in Bear 21 saw people running from a house that burst
into flames and jumping onto a vehicle, which NATO officials said
may have been a tractor. Believing that they had set the house on
fire, he attacked the vehicle with a laser-guided bomb, destroying
it.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials added on Monday that in addition to the Bear 21
attack, another bomb was later dropped north of the town in an
attack by a different group of F-16's, Bear 41. Serbian television
later showed destroyed tractors at that site, raising the
possibility of civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   NATO's principal disclosure on Monday, however, was of the later
attack southeast of the town on a convoy of more than 100 vehicles.
That raid involved several sets of aircraft, including F-16's,
French Jaguars, OA-10 observer planes and a flying airborne command
and control aircraft, the AB-triple-C.
</P>
<P>
   Another important link was NATO's command center in Vicenza,
Italy, the Combined Air Operations Center, which coordinates the
raids.
</P>
<P>
   The raids on the second column began when two F-16's, Bear 31,
saw the convoy. From the start, the pilots were worried about the
possibility of civilian casualties. With many villages aflame there
was reason to think that many refugees might be on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf said the pilots in Bear 31 had an ``extensive discussion''
with the command plane about whether the convoy was a civilian or
military target.
</P>
<P>
   It was not easy for the pilots to identify the vehicles from
their altitude, and while F-16's carry advanced military
technology, these systems have their limits. Potential targets are
shown in the F-16 cockpit on a special display, which is about 4.5
inches wide and 4.5 inches high. The targets are not shown in
color, but in shades of green.
</P>
<P>
   An F-16 pilot has to look out the cockpit to see the color of
the vehicles below him, an important factor since military vehicles
are often painted dark green. He cannot use binoculars because the
cockpit is too small, a military official said.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case of the Bear 21 patrol north of Djakovica, the
Bear 31 F-16's were flying air controllers, whose mission was not
only to carry out strikes but also to coordinate attacks by other
allied planes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite worries about refugees on the road, a number of factors
led the Bear 31 pilots to conclude they had spotted a military
column: The 20 or so vehicles at the front appeared to be traveling
in formation, with a set distance between them, and they were
moving quickly, leading the pilots to believe they were not
tractors.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the command and control plane told the F-16 pilots that
the convoy was made up of Yugoslav military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The two F-16's in Bear 31 attacked the convoy, destroying one
vehicle and missing one. They called in strikes by two French
Jacguar planes, who missed the convoy.
</P>
<P>
   The F-16's ran low on fuel and were replaced by another pair,
Bear 41, who came under Serbian antiaircraft fire.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there was an ominous warning. After twenty minutes of
bombing the convoy, the command center in Italy wanted the planes
to check the targets again and make sure that they were military.
Military intelligence experts at the command center were dubious
that Serbian forces would be driving down an open road in such a
long convoy.
</P>
<P>
   To get a better look Bear 41 asked for help from a pair of
OA-10's, known as Cubs. The pilots reported that military vehicles
had been struck, but that civilian vehicles also seemed to be
present. By then eight laser-guided bombs had been aimed at a
convoy south of Djakovica, though not all of them hit their mark.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf, while insisting that some military vehicles were hit, says
other targets destroyed appeared to be tractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we watch these videos in the comfort of this room and on a
large display, it appears possible the vehicles are tractors or
tractor-type vehicles,'' he said. ``As I reviewed the tapes with
the pilots, they agreed. However they were emphatic that from the
attack altitude, to the naked eye, they appeared to be military
vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf acknowledged that British Harrier pilots had seen a convoy
in the area and had identified it as containing refugees. This
happened at about the same time as the attacks on the convoy were
being carried out, but Leaf said the Harriers were ``not in
communication with the aircraft in question.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior allied officer said the episode has led NATO commanders
to re-examine procedures for finding and identifying targets. But
worried also about antiaircraft fire, the alliance appears intent
on continuing high-altitude strikes for now.

STRAWBERRY IS ONLY ONE PART OF YANKS' LEFT-FIELD PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deeply disturbed that he wasn't on the New York Yankees' roster,
Darryl Strawberry returned nine days ago to Tampa, Fla., where he
subsequently was arrested on charges of cocaine possession and
solicitation of prostitution, placing his baseball career in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   If Strawberry had avoided trouble, he probably would have had a
chance to play with the Yankees by the end of this month, in left
field, for five or six innings at a time. Among a handful of
problems nagging the Yankees, who carry a four-game losing streak
into Tuesday night's contest with the Texas Rangers at Yankee
Stadium, is the terrible production they are getting from their
left fielders.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Strawberry passes all of his pending drug tests, hurdles
his many legal obstacles and reaches an understanding with the
Yankees' owner, George Steinbrenner, he still won't be ready to
play for the foreseeable future. His workouts at the Yankees' minor
league complex in Tampa won't continue until his status is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball expected to receive results Monday from
the drug test Strawberry took last Tuesday, about 36 hours before
his arrest. Stawberry has been subject to regular testing by
baseball since the mid-1990s, when he underwent drug treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Levin, a baseball spokesman, said he would not discuss any
matter regarding Strawberry's drug tests, in keeping with a policy
to keep details of baseball's after-care program confidential
unless disciplinary action is taken. Silence bodes well for
Strawberry _ for the moment, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball administered at least one more drug test
after Strawberry's arrest, perhaps two, and those results could
come back later this week. The Yankees will be advised of the
results only if necessary, according to Brian Cashman, the general
manager. ``We've been told we're on a need-to-know basis,'' Cashman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry flew to New York from Tampa on Sunday in relation to
his after-care program and met with three people: Luis Melendez, a
lawyer for the owners' labor relations committee; Gene Orza, the
associate general counsel of the players association, and Dr. Joel
Solomon, who is affiliated with the players association. It is not
known exactly what was discussed, but given the people involved,
it's unlikely this meeting was meant to serve as a springboard for
disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's case is being reviewed by the state attorney's
office in Tampa, and an arraignment date won't be set until later
this week, at the earliest. According to his Tampa-based lawyer,
Joseph Ficcarrotta, Strawberry ``is doing very well, he's very up
and very positive, and he's looking forward to getting back into
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Strawberry continued his recovery from colon cancer without
incident, he could have been assigned next week to Class AAA
Columbus, where he would have had the opportunity to show he could
play left field.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Yankees want someone to take the job for his own.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee started in left field on opening day and struck out
three times, Chad Curtis played the next five games before giving
way to Ledee, who lasted one day before Shane Spencer took over,
and so on. Curtis is the only left fielder to start back-to-back
games. Don Zimmer, the Yankees' interim manager, has been waiting
for one of the three to get hot, with little success. Curtis hit a
home run in each of his first two starts, and yet collectively, the
threesome are batting .132 with 15 strikeouts in 38 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   As manager Joe Torre did last year, Zimmer is trying to give
playing time to all the left fielders. But Ledee and Spencer don't
have the experience that Tim Raines and Strawberry do, and struggle
when they play sporadically. Ledee has seven strikeouts and has hit
into a double play in his 11 at-bats (his only hit is an infield
single), and in one game last week, Spencer uncharacteristically
struck out three times on breaking balls.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees starved for run production, they could
determine to play one left fielder for the time being, perhaps
Spencer, who drove in 12 runs in 25 games in spring training. If
Ledee does not show progress, he could be a candidate for demotion
when third baseman Scott Brosius (sprained ankle) is eligible to
come off the disabled list April 29.
</P>
<P>
   The left fielders are not alone in their slumps. Tino Martinez,
the first baseman, has two runs batted in in 12 games, Bernie
Williams has just three extra-base hits, and Paul O'Neill is
hitless in his last four games, going 0 for 15.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch is 10 for 21 in his last five games, hitting the
ball very hard after radically changing his approach at the plate
last week. Typically patient, Knoblauch has started attacking
pitches early in the count and in ball-strike counts favorable to
hitters.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' starting pitching, once again considered the
potential weakness of this team, has been outstanding.

2 RIVALS JOIN TO TAKE OVER REVIVED FUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ask Wall Street experts to name two financiers whose
fortunes are tied most closely to the bond market and they would
most likely settle on Jon Corzine, the chairman of Goldman Sachs
Group, and John Meriwether, founder of the hedge fund Long-Term
Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
   So it comes as only a mild shock that Corzine and Meriwether,
longtime rivals and even bitter antagonists as recently as last
fall, have joined forces. Their plan is to head a revived version
of Long-Term Capital free from the banks and brokerage firms that
rescued it from imminent bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the new alliance, which was confirmed by people close
to the hedge fund, were sketchy Monday night. But Corzine and
Meriwether are expected to serve as the lead partners in a new
company that specializes in bond trading. They are seeking to line
up outside investors who could buy the multibillion-dollar fund
from the 14 Wall Street firms, including Goldman itself, that now
own and control it. The effort is in its early stages, the people
close to the hedge fund said.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital generated riches for its founding investors
for several years but nearly went broke during the panic in world
bond markets last September, just after Russia defaulted on its
debt. The Federal Reserve feared that the collapse of the fund,
which held securities valued in excess of $100 billion, could set
off a huge financial crisis. The Fed arranged for banks and
brokerage firms to keep it solvent with a capital injection of $3.6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Long-Term Capital has recovered strongly, earning at
least 25 percent profits for its saviors as it sold off risky
securities and reduced the amount of money it borrows to make bets.
</P>
<P>
   Meriwether and his partners have sought for weeks to secure a
future for the hedge fund independent of the Wall Street firms.
They have traveled around the world to explain its near-death
experience to early backers and line up future investment. The
consortium of Wall Street firms seems receptive to a buyout: People
close to the consortium said the banks would consider selling all
or part of its 90 percent stake as early as June.
 &UR;  &LR;  The involvement of Corzine in Long-Term Capital's efforts to
secure a future is rich in paradox. Early this year, Corzine lost
his executive position at Goldman in a board room coup, a rare
public rift at the tight-knit firm.
</P>
<P>
   Other top executives there complained that under Corzine, who
rose up to Goldman's executive suite from the bond-trading floor,
the firm wagered too much in risky bond trading. Goldman suffered
nearly $700 million in trading losses last fall, causing it to
withdraw plans to offer shares to the public at that time. Corzine
kept his position as chairman but recently announced plans to
retire as soon as Goldman completes its public offering, which is
scheduled for early May.
</P>
<P>
   Meriwether's bond-trading career has had similar ups and downs.
As the bond king at Salomon Brothers, Meriwether made that firm a
Wall Street powerhouse only to resign after a bond-trading scandal.
He eventually founded Long-Term Capital and staffed it with his
Salomon colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The two Wall Street executives were not thought to be friends.
In fact, they battled for top trading talent in the 1980s when they
ran the bond desks at Salomon and Goldman. And, in their more
recent roles, they butted heads in August, when Long-Term Capital
neared collapse.
</P>
<P>
   With Corzine calling the shots, Goldman sought to line up
investors to buy Long-Term Capital for pennies on the dollar. The
bid came even as Goldman itself negotiated to buy Long-Term Capital
as part of the Wall Street consortium. Goldman's independent buyout
offer was backed by Warren Buffett and American International
Group, the insurance giant. If it had succeeded, Goldman would have
taken over Long-Term Capital and Meriwether and his partners would
have been ousted. Several Long-Term Capital partners complained
about Goldman's role in subsequent interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine made another pass at Long-Term Capital in October, when
he called Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia to gauge his
interest in buying the hedge fund from the consortium. That effort
failed as well.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear when Meriwether and Corzine decided to join forces
instead of competing against each other, but people close to the
hedge fund said they had been talking for several weeks. Goldman
recently sent a letter to other members of the consortium,
including Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Citigroup and
Chase Manhattan, informing them of Corzine's intention of working
with Meriwether. The letter said that Corzine was acting as an
individual, not as chairman of Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   Both Corzine and Meriwether declined to comment on their plans,
which were first reported Monday in The Financial Times of London.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has been exploring future options for several months.
Top political figures in New Jersey, where Corzine lives, said the
financier had been actively exploring a bid to run for Senate on
the Democratic ticket in 2000. It could not be determined whether
Corzine's involvement with Meriwether would alter those plans.

MISSING LAWYER RETURNS AND SURRENDERS TO POLICE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ F. Mac Buckley, the Connecticut lawyer and
boxing promoter who vanished on his way to a hearing seven weeks
ago, turned himself in to the state police Monday morning and
appeared in court a few hours later looking trim and bronzed.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, who is charged with embezzling several hundred thousand
dollars from clients, was released on a $200,000 bond on the
condition that he immediately check into a locked ward of a
psychiatric hospital in Hartford until a court appearance scheduled
for April 30.
</P>
<P>
   It was a stunning comedown for Buckley, a defense lawyer known
for his fondness for cigars and tall tales, and for representing
mobsters and others in criminal cases. He is a former assistant
federal prosecutor, ran unsuccessfully for Congress and appeared on
ESPN as a commentator during the O.J. Simpson case.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Buckley had called a lawyer who arranged for him to
be interviewed by a psychiatrist for several hours, according to
statements in court Monday. The psychiatrist prepared a letter that
was presented in Superior Court here. Its contents were not
revealed, but Judge Patrick J. Clifford said after reading the
letter that he did not think Buckley was a danger to the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only threat may be to himself at this particular time,''
said Clifford, who entered a not guilty plea on Buckley's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, 57, whose case had been featured on the Fox television
program ``America's Most Wanted,'' told the authorities little
about where he had been since he disappeared on March 1. The
prosecutor, Herbert E. Carlson Jr., said Buckley's lawyer, Hubert
J. Santos, had said only that his client had been ``down south''
and ``a long distance away.''
</P>
<P>
   The many lawyers who packed the courtroom Monday morning said
they were startled by Buckley's deep tan and sun-lightened hair. He
had lost so much weight _ his wanted poster put him at 230 pounds,
but Monday's booking sheet said he weighed 200 _ that he kept
hiking up his pants during his court appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after Buckley's disappearance, friends said they
feared he might have been harmed by a former client or by an enemy
of one of the many gang members and mobsters he defended over the
years. The police searched the roads and woods between his home in
Marlborough and New Haven, where he had been due in court.
</P>
<P>
   But Buckley was declared a fugitive 11 days after his
disappearance, when warrants were issued charging him with
first-degree larceny and second-degree forgery. A couple he had
represented charged that he had forged their signatures on a check
from an account he held in trust for them, following a settlement
for their daughter's death in a drunken-driving accident. Buckley's
law license was suspended a week after his disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Santos said his client wanted ``to make sure that the victims
who are mentioned in the arrest warrant are made whole.'' He did
not mention the several other former clients who have gone to the
authorities with accusations that they had lost money Buckley
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   After Buckley surrendered at the state police barracks in
Hartford, he was arrested on the two felony charges, then taken to
court. He was met by his wife, Donna, five daughters, two
grandchildren, a brother and a sister. One daughter put up $20,000
in cash, 10 percent of the amount of the bond, and Buckley posted
bail two hours after his arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley and Santos were silent as they waded through the
newspaper and television photographers who followed them down the
sidewalk outside court. Santos, a former law partner of Buckley's,
briefly choked up during the arraignment. But Buckley stared coolly
at Clifford the whole time.

 &HT;    Fire used to battle Everglades blaze
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTON, Fla. _ Forest rangers trying to control a raging
Everglades wildfire that has consumed 120,000 acres are fighting it
the only way they know how: with fire.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, rangers began lighting fires across miles and miles
of sawgrass after the blaze jumped a canal Sunday, engulfing 10,000
acres in just twelve hours, and threatened to sweep westward. If
unchecked, firefighters fear the fire, pushed by shifting easterly
winds, will advance into parts of the Seminole Tribe's Big Cypress
reservation or the urban areas of Collier County. Rangers hope the
controlled back fires _ expected to consume another 100,000 acres _
will leave the out-of-control fire nothing to burn.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they're done, the fire will have consumed 220,000
acres in the famed river of grass that stretches for 2.365 million
acres.
</P>
<P>
   The area totals nearly half that burned in all of last year,
when blazes ignited Memorial Day weekend and continued through the
summer, erupting July 4th weekend in Flagler and Volusia counties
and chasing 70,000 people from their homes. Eventually, 370 homes
and buildings were destroyed or damaged.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, wildfires have engulfed about 130,000 acres,
not including the Everglades fire, which rangers dubbed the
``Deceiving Fire'' because of its unpredictable ferocity. The worst
fire by far ravaged Port St. Lucie, where federal and state
officials raised the tally of destroyed houses to 51 on Monday. St.
Lucie County officials valued the damage at $4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 127 homes were burned as fires, fanned by 30 mph winds,
streaked through the neighborhoods. The Federal Emergency
Management Agency arrived Monday to begin helping families. And
state legislative leaders decided to seek another $10 million to
battle the wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, skies in southern Palm Beach County darkened
with a dirty brown haze rising from the Everglades fire Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   The fire ignited Friday _ rangers have several theories on how
including sparks from a catalytic converter, but say the source was
definitely not natural _ but didn't grow alarming until Sunday. Up
until then, rangers thought they had the fire hemmed in by four
barriers: Interstate 75 on the south, which the Florida Highway
Patrol shut down Sunday because of heavy smoke; U.S. Highway 27 on
the east; the L-5 canal to the north; and to the west, the Miami
Canal, a 30-foot wide waterway which runs from Lake Okeechobee to
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Wind, dryness fan flames
</P>
<P>
   But about 7 p.m., flames jumped the Miami Canal and streaked
westward, fanned by winds carried south by Saturday's cold front.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not for that one spot, this thing would be close to under
control,'' Division of Forestry forester Erin Albury said Monday as
he stood on the edge of Alligator Alley, his Nomex flame-retardant
jumpsuit splotched with soot. ``Yesterday evening the winds got a
little swirly. One ember was all it took to burn.''
</P>
<P>
   Then on Monday, the humidity dropped to 30 percent, sucking any
bit of moisture from the drought-stricken area. (Monday's drought
index climbed to 713 on a scale of 800.)
</P>
<P>
   Because the fire has burned mostly in the interior of the
Everglades, rangers have been unable to attack by ground. The muck,
Albury said, is too wet for brush trucks and too dry for airboats.
Instead, firefighters and rangers patrol the two highways in water
tankers, making sure embers don't cross and ignite the other side,
and keep watch from above in reconnaissance planes. Monday morning,
the planes spotted an 8-foot-wide airboat trail beyond the Miami
Canal and planned to use it as a fire break. But by 4 p.m., they
determined the trail wasn't holding and started back-burning from
the L-28 canal near the Collier County border.
</P>
<P>
   Using a helicopter from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, rangers
dropped plastic balls packed with mildly explosive chemicals along
I-75, working westward to the canal, to ignite controlled fires,
DOF spokesman John Fish said. They'll also begin burning interior
sections, he said. What worries them most now is shifting wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a cold front comes from the North, it moves to the east
and then works around to the south, just like clockwork,'' Albury
said. ``The problem is, the only wind that's really predictable is
the north wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Ash falls on community
</P>
<P>
   As those winds shifted again Monday afternoon, they sent a dirty
cloud of smoke and ash over the barrel-tiled roofs of Weston. When
the ash landed, it melted like snow, leaving a greasy spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It leaves your clothes kind of greasy,'' said Jon Hess, who
sat by his San Messina neighborhood pool as his daughter played
nearby. ``Yesterday ash was everywhere. My daughter's basketball
game had to be cancelled.''
</P>
<P>
   The fires caught almost everyone off guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a sunny day and from one instant to the other, it's
dark,'' said Carlos Gomez. ``It looked like the Fourth of July over
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Respritory problems increase
</P>
<P>
   Broward County firefighters said the number of calls _ from
complaints about smoke to trouble breathing _ shot up. They warned
people in the neighborhood to stay inside, even Monday when the
skies lightened slightly. Rescue crews also packed additional
inhalers and medicine to cover the increasing respiratory calls,
said spokesman Todd LeDuc.
</P>
<P>
   The fires were a huge inconvenience to residents of Broward and
Miami-Dade, but were expected to do little if any damage to the
Everglades, where fires are part of the natural ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Highway Patrol predicted that I-75 would remain
closed for days as rangers continue battling the blaze and rerouted
most traffic to the Tamiami Trail. Rangers also said that a series
of Florida Power &AMP; Light poles that hold wires supplying power to
much of South Florida are no longer in danger because areas around
them have already burned. They plan to continue fighting the fire
from the air, unless the back-burning fails.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going in front of this fire. We're not going to put
people out there because nothing's in danger, so we won't put
people in danger for sawgrass,'' Albury said. ``But if it continues
westward and we're talking about the Indian reservation, that's a
different ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Drivers can call a Florida Highway Patrol hot line for updates
on road closings due to wildfires and smoke. The number is
800-342-3557.

2 TROOPERS CHARGED WITH FAKING DRIVERS' RACE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing to correct garbling)  (nk) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ In the first official sign that the New Jersey
State Police may have illegally singled out black and Hispanic
motorists, the attorney general Monday announced the indictments of
two troopers accused of falsifying documents to make it appear that
some of the black motorists they had stopped were white.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers John Hogan and James Kenna, who shot three unarmed men
during a traffic stop last April and are awaiting a grand jury's
ruling on possible criminal charges, will now face prosecution on
19 misdemeanor charges each for falsifying records and conducting
illegal searches.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Peter Verniero said that after the shooting,
his investigators began an inquiry into the troopers' traffic stops
on the New Jersey Turnpike. The investigators quickly noticed a
disturbing pattern: The license plate numbers reported by the
officers did not correspond with the cars owned by the motorists
they had stopped.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing the logs of 164 troopers, investigators found
some of them routinely falsified the race of drivers they stopped.
As many as 10 other troopers could face criminal charges, a law
enforcement official said.
</P>
<P>
   Two state police supervisors said it was common practice for
troopers on the turnpike to jot down the license plate number of
white motorists who were not stopped and use them on the reports of
blacks who were pulled over. Officers called the tactic
``ghosting.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General James Gerrow said that after
conducting extensive interviews with motorists who had been pulled
over by the state police, prosecutors decided that the racial
misidentification was part of a deliberate plan to conceal the
troopers' actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an omission on their part, or a mistake,'' he
said. ``This was an intentional misrepresentation as to the racial
characteristics of the individuals they stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the troopers were acting to cover up racial
profiling, Gerrow said, ``That would be a good way to characterize
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Verniero's nomination to the state Supreme Court has faced
opposition from civil rights leaders and legal experts who argue
that he has been slow to respond to discrimination charges against
the state police.
</P>
<P>
   But by charging the two troopers Monday, the administration of
Gov. Christie Whitman signaled that it is inching toward an
admission that its troopers have engaged in racial profiling to
curb drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's indictments came as the clamor over racial profiling
escalated. The Black and Latino Caucus of the State Legislature is
to hold its next public hearing on Tuesday, and at least a dozen
motorists and former troopers are expected to testify about
discrimination. On Friday, civil rights leaders have scheduled a
march to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the shooting
involving Kenna and Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   But Verniero dismissed the suggestion that the timing of the
announcement was politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' he said at a news conference. ``And I'm not
going to dignify that with further comment.
