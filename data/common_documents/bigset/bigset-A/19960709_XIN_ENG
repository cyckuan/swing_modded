<HEADLINE> Countries Meet in Geneva to Review Global Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Officials from about 150 countries
started here on Monday a two-week series of meetings to review and
try to push forward a further strengthening of the 1992 UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change.
</P>
<P>
The event, known officially as the second session of the
Conference of the Parties to the convention, will review how much
progress the global community is making in controlling greenhouse
gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which includes a ministerial meeting on July
17-18, will also take stock of and give political push to
negotiations, now at a critical half-way mark, that should lead to
stronger commitments for developed countries to reduce emissions
after the year 2000, said Michael Zammit Cutajar, Executive
Secretary of the Convention.
</P>
<P>
Under the current Convention, developed countried should take
measures to return their greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Last year in Berlin, however, the first parties' conference of
the Convention concluded that the present commitment of developed
countries is not adequate. New negotiations were therefore
launched in Berlin in a bid to reach a "protocol or another legal
instrument" containing stronger commitments for developed
countries after the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Cutajar told a news conference Monday that negotiators are
still bargaining over a number of options, including a 20 percent
reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2005; or a 10
percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2005 and a 15-20
percent reduction by 2010; or a five to 10 percent reduction in
all gases by 2010.
</P>
<P>
All the above-mention reductions are against the base year of
1990.
</P>
<P>
Cutajar said a final agreement would not come out until the end
of next year when the third parties' conference will be held,
probably in Japan, which is supposed to adopt the new commitments.
</P>
<P>
The climate change Convention was adopted at the 1992 Earth
Summit in Rio de Janeiro and entered into force in 1994. It has
been ratified by almost 160 countries.
</P>
<P>
The Convention secretariat will relocate from Geneva to Bonn
starting in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Oxford University Appoints 162 New Professors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Oxford University has almost doubled
its number of professors, appointing today 162 professors in an
unprecedented attempt to raise the status of its dons, local press
reports say today.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the newly-appointed professors will not
receive any financial benefits, but that the appointees will be
able to use the coveted title.
</P>
<P>
The mass promotion was agreed last year by the University
Congregation, the parliament of dons, to provide recognition to
scholars of international reputation who were not getting the
esteem they deserved because financial constraints prevented their
preferment.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 dons applied for professorships, and were judged
against the research records of holders of the title in other
leading universities, as well as on their teaching and
administrative work.
</P>
<P>
A Distinctions Committee of 14 academics has accepted the
claims of 162 dons to become professors and promoted another 99 to
the lesser title of reader.
</P>
<P>
The 80 percent success rate will bring the number of professors
to 361, and the 99 new readers will take the total of readerships
to 206, out of an academic staff of 1,262.
</P>
<P>
The number of women professors has risen from 12 to 30, and the
number of women readers has increased from eight to 20.
</P>
<P>
Dr Paul Slack, the chairman of Oxford's General Board, said:
"The purpose of this exercise was to give appropriate recognition
to the outstanding quality of the academics in this university,
despite the financial pressures which prevent us from increasing
the number of professors."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Former British Conservative Prime
Minister Sir Edwards Heath has launched a fierce verbal attack
upon the Conservative Euro-secptics, saying Britain must remain at
the heart of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC television interview earlier today, Heath,
British Prime Minister from 1970 to 1974, said that the
anti-Europeans in the Conservative Party were trying to hijack the
ruling party by urging the government to stay out of the European
integration process.
</P>
<P>
"It's got to be Britain at the heart of Europe. There's no
future for this country outside the European Union, Heath made the
statement on the eve of his 80th birthday.
</P>
<P>
Heath, who took Britain into the European Community in 1972,
made it clear that anti-Europeans made up a minority of the Tory
party, pro-Europeans had not made themselves heard and "the time
has come to shout out."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he was convinced his pro-European line would
win through, adding "It will prevail because the rest of the party
just isn't prepared to go along with the rebels."

<HEADLINE> British Envoy in Cyprus to Talk about Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- British representative for Cyprus
Sir David Hannay today started his meetings with Cypriot
government officials to listen to the views of the Greek and
Turkish Cypriots on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a two-hour meeting with President Glafcos
Clerides, Hannay, who arrived here Saturday, said he has had "very
clear and very hopeful indications by President Clerides on his
view on a whole range of subjects that are under discussion."
</P>
<P>
He said he did not present any British ideas during this
meeting, but gave a report to President Clerides on his contacts
in Athens, Ankara, the U.N., the U.S. and Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Hannay's meeting with Clerides, government
spokesman Yiannakis Casoulides said the British official "has not
brought anything new from Ankara" and noted that the Cyprus
government's position on the issue of security is "well-received"
by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said during the meeting the issue of Cyprus'
joining the European Union was also discussed.
</P>
<P>
The British envoy today also had talks with Foreign Minister
Alecos Michaelides at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides told the press afterwards that the British
representative was not here to put forward views and proposals
but to listen to the positions of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
sides on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Hannay was due to cross into the Turkish-occupied northern
part of Nicosia to meet Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and the
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
seized the northern third of the island following a short-lived
Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Greek Premier to Visit Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Prime Minister Costas
Simitis will soon visit Cyprus to talk with Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides on the Cyprus problem and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by government spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides at his daily press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, however, did not give exact date for the visit,
saying that this will depend on the two leaders' schedules.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said President Clerides had renewed his invitation
to the Greek premier to pay an official visit to the island.
</P>
<P>
Greek newspapers reported Sunday that Simitis will visit
Cyprus later this month or early in autumn. He will be the third
Greek prime minister to visit Cyprus after his predecessors
Andreas Papandreou and Costantine Mitsotakis.
</P>
<P>
According to the Greek press, Premier Simitis places the
Cyprus problem at the top of his foreign policy, especially after
the reaffirmation by the European Union (EU) leaders during their
latest summit in Florence, Italy, that membership talks between
Cyprus and the EU will start six months after the end of the
ongoing EU Intergovernmental Conference.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urges Nigeria to Step Up Port Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's economy may suffer further
set-backs unless concerted efforts are made to breathe life
into the ports again, according to a World Bank report on Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The warning was contained in a statement entitled ''1995
outcome and 1996 outlook for Nigeria'', issued recently by the
bank's Acting Resident Representative in Nigeria, Thomas
Hutchenson.
</P>
<P>
In its appraisal of recent ports reforms, among other economic
matters, the statement expressed fears that exports would be
hurt by the new requirements for pre-shipment inspection.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Anthomy Ani introduced at the beginning of
the year a new clearing system at the ports. He replaced customs
officials with accountants in the task of duty collection and
made import duty report mandatory for all imports, as some
of the measures to reduce corruption and improve revenue generation.
</P>
<P>
But the World Bank report said the reform had significantly
reduced movement of goods at the ports, thereby threatening the
overall performance of the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
It noted that economic activities would continue to be
constrained by erratic supply of power, poor telecommunications
services, and incessant fuel shortage. enditem

<HEADLINE> American Expert: US-Egypt Ties to Remain Close and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Relations between Egypt and the
United States will remain close and friendly despite their
disagreements on some issues, an American expert on Arab-American
relations said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The relationship between Egypt and the United States has
always been a close and friendly one and will continue to be so,"
Henry Siegman, director of the U.S./Middle East Project of the
Council on Foreign Relations, said in an exclusive interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"In the closest relationship you can have disagreements but it
is within the framework of mutual interests and of genuine
friendship and that will continue to be the case," added Siegman,
who is here to co-chair a seminar on Arab-U.S. relations, which
opened today.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian state-run media have recently accused the U.S. of
changing its policy on the Middle East peace process and endorsing
HAB286HAB319i0708QU00:2200:220846
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's call for resuming
peace talks without preconditions, which the Arabs have regarded
as going against the principle of land for peace.
</P>
<P>
The state-run press also accused the United States of adopting
double standards over the issue of armament in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government apparently has also shown resentment
against the United States recently, leading to speculation that
U.S.-Egyptian relations have become strained.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether there is any connection between Egypt's move to
seek more European support to the Middle East peace process and
the U.S. policy on Arab-Israeli negotiations, Siegman admitted
that the entire Arab world would like to see the European
countries more deeply involved in the "diplomatic aspects" of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is not surprising that the Arab world will look
for support in Europe since there had been a "long disagreement"
between the U.S. and the Arab world on policies toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the U.S. would change its policy on the Mideast
peace process, Siegman said that it is hard to say now because
Netanyahu's policy has not been clear.
</P>
<P>
"We also don't know how the U.S. government will respond to the
policy and deal with it," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We will not likely to know until after the U.S. elections
because the entire attention and energies of President (Bill)
Clinton will now be focused on the elections rather than making
changes in U.S. policy," he said.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Punish T-shirt, Jean Wearers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian authorities vowed to
punish severely those who wear and sell jeans and T-shirts with
various designs and slogans on them, a press report said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement on government campaign against "indecent"
clothing was made by Interior Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati,
which was carried in the press here today.
</P>
<P>
Besharati urged the Iranian people, particularly women, to
observe strictly the Islamic dress code in the country, warning
"those who are found to be ignoring Islamic clothing standards,
both producers and wearers, would be dealt with very strictly by
law enforcement forces."
</P>
<P>
Under the law, importers, producers and sellers of such
"indecent" clothing would be considered as law breakers and their
goods would be treated as smuggled items and confiscated.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian interior minister urged producers and importers of
clothing items to keep in mind the Islamic models or those that
are compatible with the Iranian Islamic culture.
</P>
<P>
Those who are found to violate Islamic dress standards would
have their shops closed from three to six months, their business
licenses withdrawn, and would be fined in cash and imprisoned,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It said that similar punishments are envisaged for the
consumers of "indecent" clothing in public places.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic dress code applies to both women and men in Iran
though it is more stringently enforced in relations to women. In
the strict sense, the traditional Islamic dress code for women is
the "chadore" or a loose black fabric that covers women's bodies
completely with the exception of their faces.
</P>
<P>
Men should also observe some kind of dress code and be covered
with shirts with long sleeves.

MAPUTO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocunbi supports UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in
effots to win another term of office as the UN Chief.
</P>
<P>
Mocunbi told a press conference here today that Ghali has
right to be re-elected to the post of the UN Secretary-General,
as did all his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
It is the African community, rather than the Mozambican
government, which should have an answer to the question of
whether Ghali should be re-elected to the post as the African
candidate, the prime minister noted.
</P>
<P>
The United States has expressed strong opposition to the
re-election of Ghali as UN Secretary-General, criticizing him
for lacking courage for the restructuring of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Mocunbi termed the US critics as inadequate as reason for
barring Ghali from re-election.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is an organization representing all the
member states, instead of the United States only, although the
latter has right to air its view, according to the Mozambican
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Reports say that the United States has threatened to use
veto power in order to block efforts for Ghali's re-election.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pakistan Faces Challenge of Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is facing an intensified
challenge of terrorism as a bomb exploded today in Faisalabad, the
textile industry hub of the country.
</P>
<P>
Three persons were killed and 23 others injured in the bomb
explosion at the waiting room of the Faisalabad Railway Station.
</P>
<P>
According to Police sources, the bomb which was concealed in a
plastic bag under a bench, went off at 1:55 PM (0855 GMT), causing
severe damage to the building besides claiming human lives.
</P>
<P>
"The bomb went off with a big bang, almost deafening me for
sometime," said Ghulam Hussain Bhola, an eye-witness.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a bomb disposal unit has collected the splinters of
the bomb and are investigating the make and intensity of the
device, police said.
</P>
<P>
Although the bomb caused great panic in the station, no train
has been held up after the incident, said a railway press release.
</P>
<P>
The bomb attack in Faisalabad, an economic center of Punjab
province of Pakistan, is the eighth of its kind in the country
since April this year.
</P>
<P>
A bomb explosion at a cancer hospital in Lahore, provincial
capital of Punjab, on April 14 claimed six lives, while another
explosion on a bus near Lahore left 52 people dead.
</P>
<P>
May 8 witnessed another bus blast at Sheikhupura in Punjab, in
which eight people were killed. And one person died in a bomb
blast at a post office in Lahore on May 26.
</P>
<P>
On June 10, eight people were killed in bomb blasts in
Gujranwala district of Punjab, and two died in a bus explosion in
the province on June 16.
</P>
<P>
The last explosion took place in Rawalpindi, a twin-city of
Islamabad, on June 27, leaving three people dead.
</P>
<P>
So far, nobody has claimed responsibility for these blasts, but
the Pakistani government has repeatedly announced that some
anti-government elements and foreign agents had something to do
with the terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Interior Minister
Nasirullah Babar had held several meetings, which were attended by
central and provincial government officials, on how to curb
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Provincial government officials had got more rights to use iron
hand to fight against the rampant terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government also received great international
support for checking terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that although terrorism could not be wiped out
in one day or two in Pakistan, the final victory would be on the
government side if it continued and strengthened its efforts
against terrorism.

LONDON July 8 (Xinhua) -- In the eyes of most British people,
their country suffered a humiliating defeat in the recent "beef
war" with the European Union (EU), according to a Gallup survey
for the Daily Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
While a tiny 13 percent believe Britain won the war, nearly
five times that number, 61 percent, believe Britain's position in
Europe is weaker as a result of it, and more than three-quarters
believe the rest of the EU emerged as the victors.
</P>
<P>
Asked which side they thought had suffered more damage, an
overwhelming 83 percent thought Britain had. Only four percent
thought it was the EU.
</P>
<P>
By an almost 2-1 margin, voters believe that in view of the
outcome of the war, normal negotiations, instead of the
government's policy of non-cooperation with EU, would have been
just as successful.
</P>
<P>
Fully 70 percent of voters rate the government's handling of
the whole beef crisis as poor.
</P>
<P>
Gallup interviewed 1,010 adults face to face between June 27
and July 1 in more than 100 districts in Britain.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Kills 450 in Northeastern Nigerian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- About 450 people have been confirmed
dead from the cholera epidemic which has been ravaging Borno
State in northeastern Nigeria for some 10 days, local press
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The State Health Management Board was quoted as saying that 42
of the victims were from Maiduguri, capital city of the state,
while the rest died in other parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
Four centers have been established in Maiduguri to treat
patients afflicted with the epidemic which has thrown the state
into panic and stretched the local medical services to the
limit.
</P>
<P>
In parts of the state capital, hotels and restaurants are
literally empty as customers apparently abstain from eating in
those places for fear of contracting the disease, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Health officials said the epidemic was caused by dirty
environment following heavy rainfall. More deaths were reported
in the rural areas, where there were few medical services for
the patients.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Produces Drug Control Document </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigergia's National Drug Law
Enforcement Agency (FDLEA) has produced a national drug control
document aimed at putting organisations and governments at all
levels into the anti-drug war efforts of the central government.
</P>
<P>
According to Major-General Musa Bamaiyi, Chairman of NDLEA,
the document is designed to assign specific roles to
organisations, governments as well as individuals in an attempt
to stamp out drug abuse and drug related offenses in the country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is facing a serious situation of drug abuse. As
Bamaiyi put it, there is no state in the country without drug
related problems.
</P>
<P>
Bamaiyi is in Borno State, northeastern Nigeria, which is the
13th state he has visited in his nationwide tour on the effective
application of the new document.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of his arrival in the state, his agency intercepted
36 bags of Indian hemp in Borno and some people have been
arrested in connection with the seizure.
</P>
<P>
According to Bamaiyi, his agency has recently destroyed Indian
hemp farms in Ondo, Osun and Taraba states, and it would destroy
all such farms whereever they are found in the country.
</P>
<P>
He called on traditional rulers, local and state governments
and citizens to assist in the war against drug offenses in order
to produce a healthier and crime-free country.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Pledges to Promote Developments on Golan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Jewish
communities from the Golan Heights said today that Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has assured them of their future on the Golan
Heights by promising to continue to develop areas on the heights.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with Netanyahu this afternoon in
Jerusalem, Sami Barlev, Qazrin mayor from Golan, said he was
assured that the government would invest more money for the
developments of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
"He promised us that we can live now on the Golan Heights
safely," said Barlev, adding that Netanyahu also promised to build
more buildings and promote developments there.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place just hours before Netanyahu is
scheduled to leave for his first official visit to the U.S. since
his election victory on May 29 and became the first directly
elected Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Barlev said that he thought Netanyahu met them before his
departure for the U.S., because "he wanted everyone to know that
Golan is part of Israel and will continue to be part of Israel in
the future."
</P>
<P>
In the 1967 Middle East war, the Israeli army captured the
Golan Heights from Syria, and on December 14, 1981, the Knesset
(Israel's parliament) passed the Golan Heights Law, declaring the
heights as part of Israel.
</P>
<P>
But Syrian leaders have maintained that the Golan Heights must
be returned to Syria before any peace agreement could be reached
between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu has repeatedly said that retaining Israeli
sovereignty over the Golan will be basis for an arrangement
with Syria, and that "the Golan is essential to the security
of Israel and its water sources."

<HEADLINE> France to Turn Jordan's Debts into Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The French government has decided to
convert Jordan's commercial debt to France, which amounts to 325
million francs (65 million U.S. dollars), into foreign
investments in development projects in the Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The 65-million-dollar debt is commercial credits granted by
French companies and guaranteed by the French government, and the
amount corresponds to 10 percent of debt ceiling in this category
as decided by the Paris Club, plus a part of the public aid to
development, according to a statement released released by the
French embassy here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in June of 1994, the Paris Club accepted a
proposal on rescheduling the whole of the Jordanian debt to its
members.
</P>
<P>
The move came in direct response to a request by King Hussein
to French President Jacques Chirac during the king's visit to
Paris in May, 1996, the embassy statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the French leader had expressed his government's
readiness to help Jordan cope with its current economic
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the French government decided on
the move during talks with a Jordanian delegation, led by  Deputy
Governor of the Central Bank of Jordan Michel Marto, which were
held in Paris on July 2.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, debts eligible to the planned operation
will  be sold by the French Treasury to international investors
wishing to invest in Jordan at a rate substantially inferior  to
its nominal value.

<HEADLINE> Report: Chinese Firms to be Listed in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Several Chinese companies will be
listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) by the year-end at the
earliest, a leading Japanese newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese and Chinese governments will agree on Chinese
firms' debut on the TSE by as early as the end of the month, the
Asahi Shimbun said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Finance Ministry's Securities Bureau and the TSE
will exchange a memorandum on the listing of Chinese stocks with
the China Securities Regulatory Commission after the two
governments approve the move, the daily newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The anticipated listing of Chinese firms, which will enable
Japanese investors to freely buy or sell Chinese stocks, is
expected to promote investment in growing Chinese enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Several Chinese companies, including a pharmaceutical
manufacturer and an automaker, have been cited as candidates for
going public on the TSE, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
A total of 26 Chinese companies have gone public in New York
and Hong Kong stock markets since 1993, when the Chinese
government began the listing of Chinese firms in overseas markets
in a bid to promote the privatization of state-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
A number of foreign companies withdrew from the TSE in the wake
of the burst of the asset-inflated bubble economy in the late
1980s. This prompted the TSE to make efforts to lure rapidly
growing Asian companies by easing listing requirements.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Get 1st Shipment of 368 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will be getting the
first shipment of military hardware worth 368 million US dollars
from the United States, Pakistani Defense Minister Aftab Shaban
Mirani said today.
</P>
<P>
Briefing newsmen in the capital's twin city Rawalpindi, Mirani
said a Pakistani vessel will be leaving the southern port city of
Karachi on July 15 and ship the first consignment from
Philadelphia of the US.
</P>
<P>
He said shipments will be completed by August 1996.
</P>
<P>
The delivery of the earlier contracted military equipment -
Howitzers, Anti-tank missiles, and P-3C Orion surveillance
aircraft - was stopped in 1990 under the Pressler Amendment, which
forbids the US from selling military equipment to Pakistan due to
its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
However, the delivery was made possible after the Brown
Amendment was passed early this year, which allows the US to
return those equipment sent to the US for repair and those
Pakistan has paid for.
</P>
<P>
The minister said so far the government of Pakistan had paid an
amount of 773 million dollars to the US for the purchase of
military hardware. This amount was besides the 658 million dollars
paid for the F-16 aircraft, which can still not be sold to
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Mirani said, had promised to return the
amount paid for the F-16 by selling the aircraft to a third
country.
</P>
<P>
So far, he said, United States has refunded 124 Million dollars
out of the 658 Million dollars paid for the F-16s.

WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Forty-eight cars of a freight
train derailed in southern Pennsylvania on Sunday, spilling corn
kernels and corn syrup into a local river.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here today, only an engineer and
a conductor were aboard the 138-car Conrail train when the
incident took place about 145 kilometers east of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
Both of them were unharmed.
</P>
<P>
About 15 cars jumped the tracks on a bridge above the Little
Juniata River, hanging off both sides of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the derailment was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
The train was from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Baltimore,
Maryland, on the same tracks that Amtrak, the government-run
railway carrier, uses for passenger trains.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Amtrak suspended train service between Pittsburgh
and Harrisburg and was moving passengers between the two cities by

<HEADLINE> U.S. Olympic Chief Wants to Put Paralympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The president of the United States
Olympic Committee has suggested to put the Paralympics ahead of
the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
LeRoy Walker said he'll submit his proposal when the executive
board of the International Olympic Committee meets in Atlanta this
week.
</P>
<P>
"I think (the Paralympics) deserves to have its day in the
sun," he said.
</P>
<P>
Walker added his proposal would draw more spectators to the
Games featuring the disabled and give organizers a chance to test
venues prior to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Paralympic officials said the idea has both benefits and
drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
Andy Flemming, president of the Atlanta Paralympics Organizing
Committee, said the concept of going first would work only if
Olympic organizers built early deadlines into construction plans
so Paralympic athletes weren't arriving to find unfinished venues.
</P>
<P>
"It could have enormous benefits if plaling allowed for it," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Walker may have to convince IOC members that those benefits
aren't just for the Paralympics.
</P>
<P>
"My loyalty in all this is to the Olympics," said Dick Pound,
an IOC executive board member from Canada. "If it would add to the
value of the Olympics, I'd be in favor of it. If not, I'd be
against it."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Firing Range Relocation Plan Causes Protest in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- About 12,000 people, including local
officials from three small towns in southwestern Japan, took to
the street today to protest against a proposed U.S. firing range
relocation plan.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here quoted local police as saying that the
protesters, chanting slogans against Japanese military policy,
gathered on the banks of the Kusu River some 800 kilometers
southwest of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
No incidents or arrests were reported by the police.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa, a small island 1,100 kilometers farther southwest, was
the focus of attention after the rape of a 12-year-old girl last
September by three U.S. servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Since then, opposition to the American bases has intensified.
And the United States agreed earlier this year to return 20
percent of the U.S. military base land to Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
To reduce U.S. military activities on Okinawa, the Japanese
government is considering letting the United States use the
artillery range at Camp Hansen on Okinawa in rotation with few
others across Japan.
</P>
<P>
One of the candidates on the rotation list, according to media
reports, is the Japanese military's Hijudai firing range covering
parts of the towns of Yufuin, Kokonoe and Kusu.
</P>
<P>
The protesters participating in today's demonstration were
worried that the U.S. military's artillery practice might be moved
closer to their rural homes.
</P>
<P>
Takaya Sato, mayor of Yufuin, said the relocation of the
practice, if decided by the government later this summer, would
spread environmental damage.

</P>
<P>
Reports from Sydney said in the Barcelona Olympic games,
Australia wrested seven gold, nine silver and 11 bronze medals.

can win 13 medals, including more than one gold with breaststroker
Samantha Riley and Scott Miller in the butterfly topping the list

coxless fours -- James Tomkins, Michael McKay and Nick Green --
will return to the water.
</P>
<P>
In the team sports, Australia's women's field hockey team are
gold medal favourites while there are also high hopes in men's

<HEADLINE> French Daily: CIA Informs Western Leaders of Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 8 (Xinhua) - The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
informed all Western leaders about the Srebrenica massacre soon
after it took place last summer, said the French daily La Croix
today.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 Muslims were killed and 5,000 others disappeared
after the eastern Bosnian enclave of Srebrenica fell to the Serbs
in July 1995, according to statistics published by Western media.
</P>
<P>
La Croix said that the CIA obtained photos showing the massacre
by July 13, 1995, from espionage satellites and U2 espionage
aircrafts flying across Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary photos showed "men standing and encircled by armed
men," and the following photos showed that the men "laid on the
ground, dead."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted an anonymous U.S. high-ranking official as
saying that "Washington had informed immediately all the partners
of the United States."
</P>
<P>
The International Tribunal on War Crimes in Former Yugoslavia
in the Hague today dug up some bodies believed to be those of the
victims of the Srebrenica massacre. The tribunal has accused
Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic of directly responsible
for the massacre.

<HEADLINE> France Repatriates 46 Children From Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 8 (Xinhua) - France will repatriate tonight 46
children from Rwanda who were evacuated by French troops to France
in May 1995 after the genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The office of the Secretary of State for Emergency Humanitarian
Affairs said that the children are due to be sent home tonight on
board a military aircraft departing from Chateuroux in central
France.
</P>
<P>
Some humanitarian associations have contested the repatriation
as "premature."
</P>
<P>
The children, of three to ten years old, belonged to a group of
72 orphans evacuated two years ago. Others will remain because
some of them have been adopted by French families, some are
receiving medical treatments and some have brothers or sisters in
France.
</P>
<P>
Five French companions of the children will accompany them to
Rwanda to make sure that the children will either find their
family members or find a family of adoption, or a follow-up be
made about the children, said French officials at the Secretary of
State for Emergency Humanitarian Affairs office.

<HEADLINE> Defense Lawyers Resign in Trail of Chun, Roh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Eight defense lawyers for former
South Korean Presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo resigned
today in protest against the judges' decision that the defendants
are guilty.
</P>
<P>
The move came at the 20th session of the public trial of the
two former presidents and their aides involved in the 1979 revolt
and 1980 crackdown on civil uprising opened at the Seoul District
Court here today.
</P>
<P>
The three-judge panel, which accepted the resignations of the
two former presidents' lawyers, plans to appoint lawyers Kim
Soo-yun and Min In-shik as state attorneys for Chun and Roh.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh, who ruled South Korea from 1980 to 1993, are the
nation's first former presidents on trial for alleged corruption,
mutiny and treason.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny and treason charges respectively stem from their
roles in the military revolt on December 12, 1979, and in the
bloody crackdown on the civil uprising on May 18, 1980, in
Kwangju, capital of South Korea's South Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh, who were arrested last year, have also been
indicted for collecting millions of dollars in bribes during their
terms.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Embarks On Journey to Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu left the Ben-Gurion Airport this evening for his first
official visit to the United States, in an apparent attempt to
persuade U.S. leaders to accept his new approach to the peace
process, which appears in striking contrast to the one taken by
his predecessor Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, eager to know the bottom lines of the
new premier's policy regarding the peace process, invited
Netanyahu to visit Washington as early as immediately after the
formation of his new government. But Netanyahu said that he could
not make it before early July.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is taking with him a string of confidence-building
measures to improve relations with the Palestinians, including
plans to ease the four-month closure on the Gaza Strip and West
bank, according to Israel Television.
</P>
<P>
He will also be expected to tell Clinton that he will meet with
Palestinian president Yasser Arafat after a meeting between the PLO
leader and Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu is unlikely to announce army redeployment
from the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
During the week-long visit, the premier is due to meet with
Clinton Tuesday. As currently scheduled, he will hold separate
talks with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Defense
Secretary William Perry and Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor. He
will also meet with congressional leaders and CIA Director John
Deutch.
</P>
<P>
Arrangement will also be made for a meeting between Netanyahu
and Republican presidential candidate Robert Dole. Netanyahu will
address the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish
Organizations.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is accompanied by his wife Sara, and two children
Yair and Avner. Others accompanying him include Jerusalem Mayor
Ehud Olmert, Foreign Policy Adviser Dore Gold, Director-General of
the Prime Minister's Office Avigdor Lieberman, Director for Policy
Planning and Communication David Bar-Ilan, Cabinet Secretary Danny
Naveh, Spokesman Shai Bazak, Director of the Government Press
Office Moshe Fogel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is to return to Israel late Saturday night.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Launches ON-Line International Register on Biosafety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Geneva-based UN Environment
Programme launched on Monday on the Internet the first-ever
International Register on Biosafety with a view to help countries
to better monitor and manage biotechnology risks.
</P>
<P>
The Register will contain authoritative and comprehensive
information on existing biosafety regulations, related conventions
and other legal instruments, risk assessment and management
procedures and programmes, as well as advisory services.
</P>
<P>
It will be linked to relevant national, regional and global
information networks accessible on the Internet. The information
subscribed will be provided by governments, UN entities,
universities, scientific institutions and biotechnology industry.
</P>
<P>
By establishing a knowledge base and promoting information
exchange, the Register is expected to help governments to control
or prevent imports of living modified organisms that the country
may lack the ability to safely manage, the UNEP said.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNEP, the Register is inspired by growing
concerns about the potential risks posed by living modified
organisms produced by modern biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
The risks include unintended changes in the competitiveness,
virulence, or other characteristics of the target species, and the
possibility of adverse impacts on non-target species and
ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
While many countries with modern biotechnology industries do
have domestic legislation, many others lack a national regulatory
regime governing the safe development, use and transfer of
biotechnology. the UNEP said.
</P>
<P>
Another concern is that many developing countries do not have
the technical, financial and institutional capacity to address
biosafety.
</P>
<P>
There are also no binding international agreements addressing
the situations where living modified organisms cross national
borders, according to the UNEP.

ATHENS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos said today Greece wholeheartedly supported Romania in its
bids to join NATO and the European Union, following a meeting with
his visiting Romanian counterpart, Teodor Melescanu.

his meeting with Pangalos had been the agreement to further
consolidate relations between the two ministers and ministries.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from the role Greece has to play in the framework of
inter-Balkan cooperation and in the Balkan region, we place
particular weight on the fact that Greece is the only Balkan state
in the European Union. As such, its role in the development of
relations with all European bodies is decisive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Melescanu said he was grateful for Greece's support and
stressed that he and Pangalos agreed on the issue of the
enlargement of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
"The enlargement should include all candidate nations," he
said.
</P>

The two foreign ministers also discussed bilateral and regional
cooperation, in light of last weekend's inter-Balkan cooperation
meeting in Sofia, and bilateral ties, including trade exchange,
which last year rose by 50 percent.

<P>
Balkan cooperation "has a future", Pangalos said, noting that
prior to the Sofia conference, Bulgaria, Romania and Greece had set
up a working group to promote the idea.
</P>
<P>
Melescanu, who arrived here today, is on an official two-day
visit to Greece. he is due to meet on Tuesday with Greek Defence
Minister Gerasimos Arsenis, Parliament Speaker Apostolos Kaklamnis
and other senior officials.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Jordan Pledges Not to Lift Subsidies on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti pledged here today that the government will not lift
subsidies on bread in a bid to ease the tension between the
government and the public on reported bread price hike.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the government will change the subsidy method
in order to confine it only to the poor Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
The conflict came following a report published in the local
press quoting Minister of Supply Muneer Suber as saying that the
price of bread, the main staple food of Jordanians, would be
raised from the current 85 fils (about 12 U.S. cents) per kilogram
to 250 fils (about 35 cents) as of July 15.
</P>
<P>
The reported price rise of bread has caused tense confrontation
between the government and opposition parties as well as
non-governmental organizations recently.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic party, Islamic Action Front (IAF), the largest
political party in the Jordanian Parliament, warned the government
"not to cross the red line," threatening to seek a vote of
confidence in the government.
</P>
<P>
But Suber has denied the report, noting that the subsidy will
only benefit Jordanians, not tourists, foreign workers or hotels.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government began studying lifting subsidies on
bread two months ago as part of the economic reform measures to
contain a budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
Bread in Jordan is sold at less than a third of the cost, so
much cheaper than the animal fodder that livestock breeders used
the subsidized bread to feed animals. Jordan's bread is even
smuggled to neighboring countries due to its cheap price.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government said that 30 to 40 percent of the
subsidized bread went to those "who do not deserve" subsidies and
to 1.2 million tourists and foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
Subsidies on bread, which every Jordanian consumes 115
kilograms a year on average, has become a great burden to the
government and is the main cause of the country's increasing
budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
Together with the huge consumption of flour (over 400,000 tons
per year) and record world grain prices as well as limited
domestic food output which meets only five to eight percent of the
country's needs, Jordan's import bill has already more than
doubled in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the government paid over 97 million dinars (about
145.5 million U.S. dollars) in subsidies on food imports
including barley and maize for animal fodder.
M01-70NAB035i0708ql02:1202:121749
</P>
<P>
Official studies forecast that state subsidies for the current
fiscal year are expected to reach 190 million Jordan dinars (about
285 million dollars), exceeding by five-fold the 38 million dinars
allocated by the state budget for subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said that an additional 30 million dinars (about
52 million dollars) or more are spent yearly for other
commodities subsidized in Jordan such as rice, sugar and
powdered-milk.
</P>
<P>
The food subsidy program is a crucial part of Jordan's social
safety net, with many officials and economists arguing that it is
vital for social stability in the debt-ridden country.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the government will have to get consent
from the public before it decides to take the boldest and the
most important step in its International Monetary Fund
(IMF)-guided reform, since its last attempt to raise the price of
bread recommended by the IMF in 1989 led to popular riots.

<HEADLINE> N. Ireland Plunged in New Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A Roman Catholic was murdered today
in a mysterious attack amid mounting Northern Ireland tension, but
politicians linked to Protestant gunmen denied it had something to
do with them, according to reports reaching here from Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The killing triggered instant speculation that Loyalist gunmen,
who killed hundreds of Irish Catholics to avenge pro-British
Protestant victims of its Catholic IRA foes, were responsible.
</P>
<P>
Police investigated the killing of a taxi driver in nearby
Lurgan, a Catholic stronghold, but said there was no indication
that it marked a return to the tit-for-tat sectarian killing that
scarred Northern Ireland for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
Joe English, a senior political figure in the Loyalist to
British rule which the IRA wants to end - said it was not the work
of the outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) who have abided by
an October 1994 ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"The loyalist ceasefire is completely intact. If there is any
breach of the ceasefire we are certainly not aware of it, and we
are as close as any observers," he told Irish Radio.
</P>
<P>
Asked if it might be the work of a lone Loyalist gunman, he
replied: "There is always that possibility, that possibility is
there for all the organisations."
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, head of Northern Ireland's biggest Protestant
pro-British political group, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), said
the killing would not serve the purpose of the province-wide
protest against the banned march.
</P>
<P>
Protestants angered at the banning of a march through a
Catholic suburb hijacked vehicles and blocked roads today in a
growing confrontation with the government and police.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators blocked main roads into Belfast, poured wet
cement on a key motorway intersection and set alight several
hijacked lorries in a trial of strength over the banning or a
parade through the Catholic Garvaghy road area of Portadown.
</P>
<P>
Political observers said that the incident had pushed
Northern Ireland closer to the brink of violence after almost two
years of uneasy peace brought about by guerrilla ceasefires and an
Anglo-Irish attempt to get protestant and Catholic politicians
discussing a settlement.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Envoy Denies Tension Between Iran and Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 8 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian diplomat denied here
today any tension between Tehran and Beirut, noting that the
bilateral relations were improving and contacts between the two
countries were continuing.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his meeting with Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz, Hamaion Alizadah, Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, said that
the Iranian-Lebanese relations were advancing and the two sides
had "a common channel" to maintain the momentum.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was the second between the Iranian envoy and
the Lebanese foreign minister in 10 days. Alizadah held another
meeting earlier today with Lebanese Vice House Speaker Elie Frizli.
</P>
<P>
Recent Beirut press reports said that a tension had loomed in
the relations between the Iranian and Lebanese governments
following a 16-day Israeli blitz in south Lebanon in April in
which some 200 Lebanese civilians were killed.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on a report that the Lebanese Embassy in
Teheran had stopped issuing entry visa to Lebanon, the Iranian
diplomat vehemently denied that there was any problem, tension or
crisis in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"These fogs or dirts you were talking about are baseless," he
told reporters, "but there are some currents which want to turn
the (Iranian-Lebanese) relationship into a ill one."
</P>
<P>
On the situations in south Lebanon, Alizadah said that the
United States and Israel did not play a positive role in
stabilizing south Lebanon and the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
"They are working to create tension and to exploit the
opportunities in order to impose some of the things upon the Arab
countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
Dissatisfied with the manner by which Iran provided
humanitarian assistance to some local Shiite organizations instead to
the Lebanese government, Lebanese President Elias Hrawi accused
Iran of bypassing the Lebanese authorities to foster its relations
with some Lebanese groups and personalities.
</P>
<P>
Iran is reportedly the main trainer and supplier of arms and
subsidization for the Lebanese Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah, or
Party of God, which strongly opposes peace negotiations with
Israel and spearheads a guerrilla warfare in south Lebanon
against the Israeli occupation.

YAOUNDE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Innocent children from war zones

the continent to stop war and save them.
</P>
<P>
"Why can't you stop war?" Angela Masali, a 12-year-old
Liberian boy who had been fighting against the fate of being a
child soldier, angrily put the question across to the 30 African
heads of state and over a dozen government chiefs attending the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) 32nd summit meeting which
opened here today.

<P>
"No child soldiers! No child soldiers!" cried another girl
delegate who comes from war-torn Sierra Leone.

<P>
Their calls were supported by the United Nations Secretary
General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who, also at the OAU summit in

their children, the future of the continent.

<P>
The heads of state, ministers, diplomats and journalists
observed a one-minute silence for the millions of children killed
at random by the wars.

A girl from Somalia told her story about a most horrible crime
in the sun: children traded for armes.
</P>
<P>
A boy from Ethiopia, who became a victim of landmine when he
was seven years old, was yearning for a safe haven for children.
</P>
<P>
The children, representing millions of others affected by wars
and conflicts in Africa, demanded that the OAU summit kick out
effective mechanisms to prevent, manage and resolve armed
conflicts in the continent.
</P>

They read out a "final communique" mapped out following a

stable life that they deserve.

MAPUTO, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocunbi said here today that Mozambique and South Africa should
exempt each other from visa requirements.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at his office, he said both Maputo and
Pretoria should make appraisals of the possible affections by the
exemption of visa requirements from the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The cancellation of visa requirements by both sides is vital,
he said, because the two governments are making efforts to
promote the free movement of people and goods across their
borders.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government in mid-June imposed an entrance visa
charge ranging from 230,000 Meticais to 600,000 Meticais (12,000
Meticais equal one US Dollar) on each South African applicant.
</P>
<P>
And, the South African government also imposed a 30-US-Dollar

<P>
He said that African countries have spent so much money
training their people, but they ask for outside help when a

Asante warned that if African countries do not become self
sustaining, most of them will enter the next century with very
bleak future.
</P>
<P>
On the UN performance in Africa, he said that though the UN
has helped alleviate some economic problems, it has not done
enough to prevent civil wars in Africa.

DAMASCUS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Syria reiterated here today that
it adheres to the peace process on the basis of relevant
U.N. Security Council resolutions and the principle of
land-for-peace.
</P>
<P>
Radio Damascus, in its commentary today, said Syria always
consider peace as a strategic option, adding that a comprehensive
and just peace could not be achieved in the region if Israel does
not return the Golan Heights it seized in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The commentary came the same day as Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu is leaving for Washington to meet
U.S. President Bill Clinton to clarify his new approach to the
peace process, which appears in striking contrast to the one taken
by his predecessor Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has rejected returning Golan to Syria, saying that he
would only accept those U.N. resolutions that serve what he called
Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
The radio accused Netanyahu of undermining the very concept of
peace which provides security for all parties.
</P>
<P>
Radio Damascus urged the United States to seriously support the
peace process in accordance with the land-for-peace principle and
international legitimacy resolutions that guarantee the interests
of all parties in the Middle East.

At the 22nd Group of 77 Chamber of Commerce and Industry

only 20 percent of the resources are available for 80 percent of

trillion U.S. Dollars by the end of last year.

He challenged leaders from developing countries to put their
heads together for the economic development of their nations so

<P>
YAOUNDE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- African leaders gathered to
address pressing issues concerning political stability and
socio-economic development in the continent as the 32nd
Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Thirty heads of state and over a dozen government chiefs in
Africa attended the meeting declared open by the current OAU
Chairman, Cameroonian President Paul Biya at 14:30 (local time),
three and a half hours behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela, whose appearance at
the meeting was greeted with waves of applause and hail, paid an
hour-long attendance at the opening ceremony, and then left to
fly to London for his state visit to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, OAU Secretary General Salim
Ahmed Salim put across the two themes of the summit, regional
peace and socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
"The horror of conflict is still haunting this contient," he
said, referring to wars in Liberia, Somalia, Burundi, Rwanda,
Sierra Leone, among others countries.
</P>
<P>
"When there is no peace and stability, there is no economic
development," said Salim, calling for all sorts of possible
contributions to strengthening the OAU mechanism of conflict
prevention, management and resolution.
</P>
<P>
The OAU scribe also pointed out a number of pressing
challenges facing Africa, namely, the overwhelming burden of
foreign debt, the daunting obstacles of regional economic
integration, the deplorable situation of food supply, health
care, education and other social problems.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the United Nations
Secretary General who is also at the OAU summit, called for the
African leaders to adopt a self-reliance policy and map out their
own action plan for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"You can depend on me. But you'd better depend on yourself,"
said the UN chief, referring to the 10-year u.n. special
initiative for Africa launched in march to raise 10 billion U.S.
Dollars to the political, economic and social development of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing OAU Chairman, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi,
in his report to the summit, summoned an unanimous political will
to step up the economic integration process which he said is the
only way that Africa can save itself and hope for a bright
future.
</P>
<P>
After the speeches, 50 children came forward onto the stage of
the OAU forum and urged the African leaders to promptly seek ways
M14-70NBB132i0708ql03:4003:400987

<HEADLINE> Iran Regrets over Mubarak's Rejection to Syrian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran today expressed regret over
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's rejection to Syria's mediation
between Tehran and Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, a spokesman for the Iranian Foreign
Ministry, said that "Iran will only resume diplomatic ties with
Egypt if it distances itself from the Zionist regime."
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak Sunday rejected Syrian efforts to reconcile
Egypt with Iran on grounds that Tehran is still trying to
undermine the Egyptian government.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman termed the Egyptian approach on the Syrian
diplomacy as a "regretable effort" and is aimed at crippling
Syrian shuttle diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Syria's diplomacy for strengthening the United
Islamic Arab front against the Israeli regime's expansionist
policies is an honest effort.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi made a reference to Arab world's show of concern over
the hardline position of the newly elected Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran welcomed Syrian diplomatic initiation only
because it would have positively contributed to strengthening the
Arab world stance against "the surging and reviving Israeli
expansionist and hegemonic policies in the region," rather than
serving its own interests.
</P>
<P>
Today's local English daily Iran News also published an
editorial, saying that "the current Egyptian stances delight
enemies of third world."
</P>
<P>
On the basis of principles of its foreign policies, the
editorial noted, Iran is ready to have closer and good relations
with all countries in the world except Israel.
</P>
<P>
It called on President Mubarak to note that the peoples of Iran
and Egypt have cultural and economic relations that are improving
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
It asked Egypt or other neighboring countries to present
evidence, if any, to prove Iran's involvement in subversive
activities in their countries.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the Iranian foreign policy-makers are
obviously confused as what policy line to pursue in relation with
Egypt as there have been differences between Iran's Supreme Leader
Ali Khamenei and moderate President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Since late March, President Rafsanjani has called for
improvement of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Our ties with Egypt is not good enough at present. We are
planning to improve our ties economically, culturally and
politically," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's statement seemed to anger Iran's Supreme Leader
Ali Khamenei whose speeches have been hostile and often insulting
to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei and his supporters oppose the establishment of close
ties with Egypt because of its good relations with Israel
following the signing of the 1979 Camp David Accord.

<P>
NAIROBI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's performance in
international trade has continued to be overshadowed by persist
deficit in its balance of trade, Kenyan Minister for Commerce and
Industry Kirugi M'Mukindia said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan minister was opening a five-day seminar on world
trade and Uruguay Round, the Kenya News Agency reported this
evening.
</P>
<P>
Kirugi M'Mukindia said Kenya's economic woes are worsened by
the high demand of imports of capital goods, while the
agricultural production performs poorly, exposing the country to
huge import bill.
</P>
<P>
He said Kenya's exports base is diversified through primary
agricultural products such as coffee, tea, hides and skins, sisal
and horticultural produce.
</P>
<P>
He said the unstable nature of the world's agricultural
commodities markets and susceptibility of farm produce to the
various weather conditions pose a grave danger on economic
planning and management.
</P>
<P>
The five-day seminar organized by the Kenyan government
attracted over 100 participants from civil service, private and
parastatal organizations and international organizations based
here.

<HEADLINE> All Pows in Croatia to be Freed by August 20 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Croatian government Committee
for Captured and Missing Persons has promised to release by August
20 all prisoners of war (pows) remaining in Croatian prisons.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the Yugoslav government Committee for
Humanitarian Issues and Missing Persons, Pavle Todorovic, told a
press conference here today that the Croatian committee made this
promise at a meeting with Yugoslav authorities held on july 5-6 in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
During a bid to gain independence, Croatia fought a brief war
with Yugoslavia in 1991. In a battle in@`ukovar, the Yugoslav Army
and the Croatian troops wrestled to capture the city, a strategic
place in Eastern Slavonia. The Croatian troops finally withdrew
from the city after suffering a heavy casualty.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav official also said the two countries' expert teams
had adopted a referendum which served as a basis for their
commitment to work out by September 15 detailed lists of missing
persons sought by both sides regarding the conflict in the
territory of the former Yugoslavia, to exchange these lists by
September 30, as well as lists of those not registered as missing.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also pledged to exchange by September 15 data
regarding the identification of persons who were killed during the
Yugoslav-Croatian war and thus enable each other to deliver their
remains, he added.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council is
expected to renew U.N. Angola Verification Mission III (UNAVEM
III) for another three months, council sources said after
closed-door consultations today.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said that formal action will be
taken at a meeting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
UNAVEM III, which has 7,2000 troops, is now the biggest
peacekeeping operation of the world organization.
</P>
<P>
It was established to help implement an agreement signed in
Lusaka, Zambia, in November 1994, ending nearly two decades of
civil war between the Angolan government and former rebels of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
</P>
<P>
In a recent report to the Security Council, U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said UNAVEM III's
involvement, particularly at this stage of the implementation of
the Lusaka Protocol, remains essential. He thus recommended that
the missin be extended for another three months.

<HEADLINE> Global Warming Poses Threat to Public Health: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 8 (Xinhua) -- United Nations health and
environmental agencies warn that global warming due to air
pollution "could have a wide range of impacts on human health."
</P>
<P>
The warning is given in a report due to be issued today when
international negotiations on global warming resume in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have become more and more concerned about the
possible health consequences of global warming. They believe that
the earth climate will change rapidly in the coming century as
pollution in the atmosphere traps solar radiation -- the so-called
greenhouse effect.
</P>
<P>
Within five years, according to the report, the warming of
climate could increase substantially the proportion of the world's
population living in potential malaria zones.
</P>
<P>
Heat waves triggered off by global warming have caused
thousands of additional deaths each year in major cities
worldwide, and would lead tens of millions of people to the risk
of malaria, the report warns.
</P>
<P>
According to another report issued by the World Energy Council
in London last Thursday, carbon dioxide emissions largely from
burning of fossil fuels rose 12 percent between 1990 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times today quoted the Centers for Disease Control
as reporting that a heat wave killed 465 people in Chicago, the
United States, alone, and in New York, where heat-related deaths
now average 320 per year, three to six times that many might die
annually by 2050.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Baltic
nations today began a 10-day land exercise in Riga, Latvia, the
U.S. State Department announced today.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first land exercise conducted in the Baltic region
under the (NATO'S) Partnership for Peace," State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns told a press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman disclosed that about 300 American Seabees and a
reinforced company of U.S. Marines will train in a peacekeeping
scenario with the Baltic Battalion.
</P>
<P>
The Baltic Battalion, formed by Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia,
is an armed force involved in the NATO-led Bosnian Peace
Implementation activities. They have been working with American
troops in the northern Bosnian part.
</P>
<P>
Burns said that the exercise "is a very important training
opportunity and a very important...symbolic opportunity to
demonstrate on a continual basis the great concern that the United
States has for the security and the future of the Baltic
countries."
</P>
<P>
"It comes in the wake of a successful meeting that President
Clinton had here, just before the Lyon summit (of the world's
leading industrialized nations), with the three presidents of
the Baltic countries," the spokesman noted.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Program to Track Guns Saled to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced today a 17-city program to trace weapons by computer as
an effort to prevent guns from reaching teen-agers' hands at a
time when juvenile crimes with guns were soaring.
</P>
<P>
The president met in the White House with law enforcement
officials from 17 cities who will provide information on guns
confiscated from juveniles so they can be traced to the seller.
</P>
<P>
"We have to give the future back to all of our children,"
Clinton said. "We cannot... keep allowing our young people to die
before their dreams ever have a chance to take shape."
</P>
<P>
Under Clinton's plan, information on confiscated weapons will
be entered into the federal computer system run by the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), and traced back to the
original seller through documents and serial numbers.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the number of homicides committed by teens with
guns has tripled since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the New York Times today, since 1984,
homicides by those under age 18 with handguns have increased by
418 percent.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier report, the paper noted that arrest rates for
homicides committed by 14-17-year-olds have more than tripled
in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Justice disclosed recently that the arrested
number of teen-agers who committed violent crimes in 1994 reached
150,000, the highest in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
Criminologists expect a new surge in crime with the number of
teen-agers projected to increase by 20 percent over the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
The ATF estimated that there are about 220 million firearms in
the United States today.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's plan was unveiled on the background that pilot
programs of gun-control in some cities have resulted in a sharp
decrease in juvenile crimes.
</P>
<P>
Gun-control was one of the options. Many states are trying to
tighten laws to get more juveniles into the adult criminal justice
system, where they will presumably serve longer sentences under
more punitive conditions.
</P>
<P>
U.S. national crime control experts warned that what was
happening was a failure of society.

<HEADLINE> US Condemns Hijacking of Cuban Jetliner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
reiterated that it "strongly condemns" the hijacking of planes
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn acts of air piracy wherever they occur in the
world," U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told
reporters when confirming that a Cuban commercial jetliner was
hijacked to an American military base at Guantanamo Bay Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the hijacker was a Cuban citizen who identified
himself as a lieutenant colonel. The plane carrying three crew
members and 15 passengers was hijacked en route from Santiago to
Guantanamo City.
</P>
<P>
"After determining that the plane was airworthy, that all
aboard were unharmed, and that all aboard wished to resume their
journey to Guantanamo City, the U.S. military authorities cleared
the three crew members and the 14 passengers...to depart
Guantanamo Bay Naval Base," Burns added.
</P>
<P>
But he said the hijacker, whose name is Jose Fernanadez Pupo,
was kept behind.
</P>
<P>
"He is currently in custody at Guantanamo Bay. He is in the
brig there. He is being questioned by our military authorities
and by Justice officials...about why he undertook this action,
and about what his plans and desires might be," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the fate of the hijacker would not be
determined "before the period of questioning has been completed."

NEW YORK, July 8 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks slid further
today, failing to stabilize after Friday's tumble on a strong
employment report that aggravated inflation fears and sent
long-term interest rates higher.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.31 to 5,550.83, adding
to Friday's 115-point plunge.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly a 7-to-3

The NYSE's composite index fell 2.91 to 350.33, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 4.92 to 652.52.

<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 9.52 to 1,148.83, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 5.42 to 568.91.

Many leading technology names rebounded slightly, however. On
the Nasdaq, Intel and Microsoft both advanced. And on the NYSE,
IBM was one of the Dow's strongest components.

WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Two Ku Klux Klan members being
held on state charges in the burning of a predominantly black
church in South Carolina last year also have been charged in
federal court, the U.S. Justice Department announced today.
</P>
<P>
The two men were named in a federal complaint and arrest
warrant unsealed today by a federal judge in Charleston, South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
Gary Christopher Cox, 23, and Timothy Adron Welch, 24, were

Church in Greeleyville, S.C.
</P>
<P>
The department said the two men were members of the Christian
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
The federal criminal complaint alleges that the men violated a
federal criminal arson statute. If convicted on the federal
charge, Cox and Welch could face up to 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department said there have been fires at more than
50 churches, black and white, across the country since June 1.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Pledges Solidarity With Rest of Africa by Guo Ming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela today pledged his solidarity with the rest of Africa in
its fight for political stability and economic independence.
</P>
<P>
"We are here to celebrate the successes of the continent and
to share in her pain as equals," said Mandela in a written
message to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) 32nd Summit.
</P>
<P>
Mandela appeared for an hour-long at the opening ceremony of
the summit being attended by a total of 30 heads of state and
over a dozen of government chiefs in Africa, and then flied on to
London for a state visit to Britain.
</P>
<P>
As he entered the OAU Assembly Hall, the "African hero" became
the only leader who was greeted with waves of applause and hail
from the younger generations of African leaders, the official
delegates, the foreign envoys from all over the world, together
with the journalists.
</P>
<P>
"We are indebted to you for struggling on our side as brothers
and sisters to reclaim our common dignity," said Mandela who came
here to attend the OAU 32nd summit.
</P>
<P>
Without making a speech at the summit, the South African
president, or rather, hero of the African continent, just sat
quietly listening to calls and appeals from other leaders of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Mandela also asked African leaders to "put
people first", and to "take the responsibility to steer the
continent in her way to the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
"We assemble here not merely as ourselves nor for ourselves;
but as leaders expected by dint of continental mandate, to give
leadership and reclaim to her, Africa's deserved position in
world affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa acquired the OAU membership in 1994 when the last
decay of apartheid was removed by the free, democratic general
elections during which Mandela became the first black president
of the country.
</P>
<P>
President Mandela did not appear at the 31st OAU summit held
in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa last June.
</P>
<P>
"We feel honored by his coming this time," said many African
ambassadors here. enditem

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets Burundi State Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, Chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, today expressed satisfaction with the development of
the Sino-Burundi relations, and hoped for expanding cooperation
between the two countries in various ways.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Nicolas Mayugi, state secretary of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Burundi, Li said
China attached much importance to its links with Burundi,
believing relations would develop on the basis of the existing
good ties.
</P>
<P>
Though China and Burundi are separated afar, and each has its
own specific conditions, they share or have similar views on major
international issues. It is a set policy of the Chinese government
to strengthen relations with Burundi and other African countries,
as well as all other developing countries. The Chinese government
thanked the Burundi government and its people for their support to
China on international issues.
</P>
<P>
"As old friends of Burundi, the Chinese people and the
government sincerely wish Burundi to develop its economy and
maintain social stability, and hope that the Burundi people under
the leadership of the Burundi government, can unite and join their
efforts to rebuilt their homeland," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed the guests on China's economic and social
development, and the ongoing reform and opening to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC leader said China is confident in solving the
existing problems, such as poor agricultural infrastructure, low
efficiency of state-owned enterprises, and poor social order in
some areas.
</P>
<P>
Mayugi said he was honored to have met with Chairman Li for the
third time. Burundi and China have a deep-rooted friendship which
has stood various tests, he said, adding that the Chinese people
and government were always on the Burundi side in the most
difficult periods.
</P>
<P>
And in the United Nations, China opposed the armed intervention
by foreign power into Burundi's internal affairs, thus maintaining
the integrity of sovereignty of Burundi, Mayugi noted. "For this,
the Burundi people are sincerely grateful to the Chinese people."
he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharing Li Ruihuan's view on bilateral relations, Mayugi said
the friendship between Burundi and China has been developing
continuously since the two countries forged links diplomatically
in 1962.
</P>
<P>
Mayugi promised that the Burundi government would always
support China in major international issues, and support China's
stand in realizing its national reunification.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Per Capita GDP Up 11 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's per capita gross domestic
product (GDP) recorded an 11.2 percent increase in the outgoing
fiscal year ending July 15, the government said in an economic
survey.
</P>
<P>
According to the economic survey report for the 1995-1996
fiscal year, presented to the parliament Monday, the country's GDP
rose 6.1 percent in the year.
</P>
<P>
The 1995-96 fiscal year had witnessed a high economic growth
rate thanks to a remarkable increase in the agricultural
production, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The state of industrial production and investment was also
encouraging and the export sector had reversed the declining trend
during the last few years, it said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's economic growth was only 2.9 percent in the 1994-95
fiscal year mainly due to a slight decline of agricultural output
caused by unfavorable weather condition.
</P>
<P>
According to the economic survey, positive impacts had been
noticed in the country's economy as a result of the
market-oriented economic policies pursued by the present
government.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural production was expected to increase by 5.4 percent
this year while non-agricultural production was to go up by 6.7
percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Food grain production was estimated to increase by 13.4 percent
to 6.14 million metric tons this year, it said.
</P>
<P>
Total investment in the country increased by 18.7 percent in
the 1995-96 fiscal year against the 15.4 percent recorded in the
previous year, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
As one of the world's poorest countries, Nepal's per capita GDP
is less than 200 US dollars, according to the World Bank figures.

<HEADLINE> New Drugs Not Cure for AIDS, Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- New Drugs that have been marketed
recently to attack the AIDS virus should not be viewed as a cure
but a way of keeping AIDS at bay, a leading scientist told the
11th International AIDS Conference in Vancouver, Canada.
</P>
<P>
It is dangerous to get carried away with the hype of
cutting-edging AIDS treatments because the fight to squelch HIV is
not won, said Dr. Scott Hammer of Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
"Complacency that we have arrived needs to be avoided," he was
quoted as saying by today's local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The AIDS virus causes a breakdown in the immune system that
leaves people open to illnesses that constitutes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Protease inhibitors are a series of new drugs that can disable
HIV when used with other drugs. But it is far too soon to say that
they kill off HIV.
</P>
<P>
Their prohibitive prices, up to 10,000 U.S. dollars a year
taken as part of a cocktail of drugs, keep those most need them
away in the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Some 90 percent of new HIV infections occur in the developing
world where few could afford the drugs.
</P>
<P>
By the turn of the century, about 44 million people will fall
victim to the HIV virus that causes AIDS, up from an estimated
21.8 million currently.
</P>
<P>
The five countries with the highest estimated number of HIV
cases are: India, three million; South Africa, 1.8 million;
Uganda, 1.3 million; and Kenya, 1.1 million, according to the
United Nations AIDS Program.

<HEADLINE> France Loses its Seasons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Heavy snowfalls and unexpected
temperature drop give the French people real cool days this
summer, with today's daytime temperature in Paris reading 20
degree Celsius, a 21-year low, the weather bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Winds up to 180 kilometers per hour swept across the north of
the Mediterranean island of Corsica and areas in southeastern
France had as much rain on Sunday a day as usually in a month and
a half of summer.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures Sunday afternoon in Clermont-Ferrand, Macon,
Dijon and other central cities fell to 14 degrees Celsius, the
lowest in 50 years or at least 10 degrees Celsius below the
seasonal average.
</P>
<P>
Snowfalls and strong winds in the Alps even forced bicycle
riders at the Tour de France to change to buses to avoid likely
dangers on a uphill course.
</P>
<P>
But the cold weather does not necessarily mean that the French
poeple should take out their spring fashions, because just a month
ago the temperature stood at 30 degree Celsius, and the weatherman
said it will warm up any time. No wonder some French are saying
that France has lost its seasons.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Spread Slows in Canada, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of new HIV infections per
year in Canada has declined sharply since the peak of the
disease's spread, according to the latest federal statistics.
</P>
<P>
In 1982-83, there were 5,500 new HIV infections annually. In
the period from 1989 to 1994, the new HIV infections went down from
2,500 to 3,000, says the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control
(LCDC) under the federal Health Department.
</P>
<P>
The number of actual AIDS cases diagnosed per year -- about
2,300 annually -- has remained virtually unchanged for the past
three years, ending a decade of steady rise, LCDC was quoted as
saying by today's local press report.
</P>
<P>
The leveling of new cases is largely due to public education
and prevention of the past decade, LCDC said. An estimated 50,000
Canadians are carrying HIV or have AIDS.
</P>
<P>
However, LCDC's figures contradict recent reports which suggest
the incidence of HIV infection in Canada is accelerating.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada reported on July 2 that the number of
Canadians diagnosed with AIDS is increasing across Canada and
among all risk groups except blood-product recipients.
</P>
<P>
The annual rate of AIDS diagnoses has gone from 1.8 per 100,000
adult population in 1985 to 9 per 100,000, or 2,500 a year, in
1994, it said.
</P>
<P>
The controversial assessments are partly because of the
continuing battle by activists for extension of federal funding.
There are concerns that support for such funding might decline if
people perceive the threat of AIDS is fading.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Agricultural Cooperative Associations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Cooperative Associations, which
used to be an effective mode of production in Lebanon's
agriculture, are declining, threatening a real crisis in the
whole sector whose products comprised 13 percent of the total
exports in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural experts attributed the decline to the lack of
organized and balanced official support which has left the
agricultural sector short of ways to tap its potentialities.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's unique topography makes only about 38 percent of
land area arable, and confines cultivation to around 22 percent
in the absence of full irrigation.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, compared with its neighbors, Lebanon is highly
favored by climate and soil for agriculture and in the case of
fruit enjoys a virtual monopoly of supplies to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Another characteristic in Lebanon's agriculture is the
exceedingly small size of land holdings. According to a survey
carried out in 1953 by the United States Operations Mission, out
of a total number of agricultural holdings of about 150,000, no
less than 132,000 were of 25 acres or less.
</P>
<P>
Even so, a small holding, particularly in the mountains, may
be broken up into several fragments separated from each other by
a considerable distance.
</P>
<P>
On their way to modernize the production, the Lebanese
agricultural population developed the cooperative associations.
</P>
<P>
Today there are 372 agricultural cooperative associations
distributed throughout the country, among which 245 are public
ones and the remaining scattered among specialized agricultural
sectors, including fishing, bees, oil and animal production.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics of the Agriculture Ministry,
members of these associations numbered 15,975 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
About 44 new cooperative associations have been established
since then, and the number of members have increased to more than
16,800.
</P>
<P>
Many of the cooperative associations have not been active
since the day of their establishment some 20 years ago, and 105
are now completely out of work.
</P>
<P>
Financial difficulties plague all the cooperative associations,
leaving the cooperatives unable to improve their performances
even as the challenges to Lebanon's agricultural sector mounted.
</P>
<P>
Only ten cooperative associations in all of the Lebanese
provinces are outfitted with proper equipment.
</P>
<P>
In the South Governorate, there are 31 cooperatives, out of 83,
which do not own any kind of machinery, and the other 52
associations altogether possess only 15 tractors, three oil mills
and ten water tanks.
</P>
<P>
The most successful model is the Qub Elias agricultural
cooperative association which established a market of its own to
enable the consumer to get their needs directly from the farmer
at the best prices and quality.
</P>
<P>
For others, the main challenge which they are facing is a
struggle for survival.

<HEADLINE> French Prosecutor Opens Case on Double-Fratricide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A procurator's office in the northern
French city of Verdun today opened a case of fratricide committed
by a 17-year-old boy, who killed his two younger brothers in
Bar-le-Duc in the department of Meuse on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The boy will be charged with "assassinating minors of less
than 15 years old," according to Agence France Presse reports
quoting procurator's office in Verdun. The two boys killed are
four and nine years old.
</P>
<P>
Procurator Thierry Villardo said that the boy, whose name was
not released, plotted the fratricide because he took advantage of
the absence of his parents and killed his two brothers in two
different rooms of the house.
</P>
<P>
" He killed his two brothers because he did not have the
courage to commit suicide. By doing this, he wished he could be
killed by others,"said Villardo.
</P>
<P>
Police said the boy had been suffering from a mental crisis and
had been given psychological treatments by a psychiatricist for
months.
</P>
<P>
Police discovered a chopper, a knife and a hammer at the scene
of the killing, which they described as "extremely violent."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pakistani Government Strives to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's balance of payments in
the new fiscal year is expected to improve in the new fiscal year
with a strong growth in exports and a relatively moderate increase
in imports.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks after the release of the federal budget for 1996-97
fiscal year, the Pakistani government has approved the foreign
exchange budget and has set an ambitious target of 10 billion US
dollars for exports and 12 billion dollars for the imports.
</P>
<P>
Local economists believe that an expected improvement in the
balance of payments will help trim the long-running trade deficit
by 657 million in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
During the current fiscal year, exports are expected to rise by
14.4 percent, while imports are projected to increase 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The envisaged increase in exports is likely to emanate from a
high growth of 6.5 percent in the commodity producing sectors,
favorable external demand conditions, and the positive impact of
the announced incentives for investment and exports of textile and
non-textile products.
</P>
<P>
The projected increase in exports is based on the assumption
that the next cotton crop would yield 10.8 million bales with an
anticipated exportable surplus of 1.8 million bales, and the paddy
crop would yield 4.2 million tons leaving a sizable surplus for
exports. These estimates are also reinforced by an estimated 7.2
percent growth rate of the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
The estimated 5.1 percent growth in imports is based on the
assumption that the general economic activity will gain momentum,
resulting in higher imports of intermediate and capital goods.
</P>
<P>
Imports of capital goods are expected to constitute the single
largest share in overall total imports with an estimated bill of
4.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The imports of petroleum oil and lubricants are to constitute
the second largest share among imported goods. The import cost is
estimated to be 2.28 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's foreign trade sector is facing major challenges
mainly because of the snowballing trade deficit caused by
relatively weak export industries and a narrow export base.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary foreign trade estimates for the last financial
year indicate a gap of three billion dollars with imports
projected at 11.5 billion dollars and export at 8.5 billion
dollars. The export target of 9.2 billion dollars has yet to be
met.
</P>
<P>
A rather striking feature of the foreign trade has been that
imports have not fallen as steeply as expected after a one-time 7
percent devaluation of rupee in last October even though it was
followed up by another 7 percent crawling readjustment of the
local currency over the whole year.
</P>
<P>
In terms of reducing the trade deficit, a traditional remedy is
the curtailment of imports and acceleration of exports.
</P>
<P>
However, that does not seem to be working in Pakistan's case.
Among Pakistan's total imports, petroleum and its products, edible
oil, wheat and fertilizers have a rather heavy weightage, and
these are obviously not to be curtailed.
</P>
<P>
And to further investment promotion efforts, the import of
machinery and raw materials will also continue to rise in response
to the demands of the various sector of the economy.
</P>
<P>
No appreciable fall in imports even after three devaluation
measures and frequent readjustments clearly indicates that
industry and trade have imported what the market demanded and the
imports can only be curtailed at the risk of slowing down the
economy. But that definitely seems to be impractical.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the projection for the rise in
imports during the current fiscal year seems to be on too low a
side to be realistic. Meanwhile, the attainment of the export
target will remain crucial and compelling.
</P>
<P>
In the longer term, there is no other option for Pakistan but
to accelerate its exports and enhance its competitiveness to a
level where the trade gap is substantially reduced.

MADRID, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Two small bombs, one of them claimed
by the Basque separatist group ETA, exploded today in the southern
Spanish resort of Almunecar, but fortunately caused no casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish Civil Guard found one of the bombs at a bus station
early this morning, shortly after receiving a telephone warning
from someone who claimed to be an ETA member.
</P>
<P>
Police set off the bomb, saying it consisted of a small
quantity of explosives and caused little damage.
</P>
<P>
The second bomb, which was also small, went off at an aquatic
park.
</P>
<P>
The blasts came on the same day as France announced the
extradition to Spain of two suspected ETA members, and on the eve
of an anti-terrorist meeting in Madrid to be attended by a group
of Spanish political parties.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish authorities, in anticipation of an ETA bombing
campaign, recently announced they would keep a wary eye on tourist
zones.
</P>
<P>
ETA, namely Basque Homeland and Freedom, has been fighting
since the late 1960s for a separate state in northern Spain,
leaving hundreds dead.

<HEADLINE> China Confident in Fulfilling Foreign Trade Target for This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Despite falling exports at the
beginning of the year, China is confident of fulfilling the 280
billion US dollars worth of foreign trade volume planned for 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the country's customs, China
registered 104.07 billion US dollars worth of imports and exports
in the first five months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The imports volume stood at 51.79 billion US dollars, down 7.1
percent in comparison with the same period of last year, while
exports increased by 34.5 percent to 52.28 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The problems facing the exports are multiple, Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi said at a national
foreign trade export conference which opened today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, some of the major problems include the rise of
export cost, foreign trade enterprises' slow transition of
management mechanism, China's disadvantages in international
competition owing to its failure to join the World Trade
Organization, protectionism of regional economic groups, and the
influence of fluctuating markets on exports of some bulk
commodities.
</P>
<P>
Although the situation for exports is not optimistic, Wu Yi
said, the overall situation for China's foreign trade is good, and
China is confident of fulfilling its import and export target for
this year.
</P>
<P>
Listing factors conducive to the development of China's foreign
trade, she said that the sustained, rapid and healthy development
of the country's national economy, and the continuous improving
economic environment, provide sufficient resources of commodities
for broadening exports on the one hand, and create a good
foundation for increasing imports and attracting foreign funds on
the other.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, the exports of
foreign-funded enterprises increased 16 percent compared with the
same period of last year, to 21.18 billion US dollars, accounting
for 40 percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Wu also urged faster transition of foreign trade mechanisms,
and of growth mode of foreign trade exports.
</P>
<P>
In addition, she urged the acceleration of the reform of
state-owned foreign trade enterprises, and the implementation of
an import and export agent system.

<HEADLINE> Work Harder to Aid Poor Farmers: Zhu Rongji </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, July 9 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji has
called for greater efforts be made to aid the poor in the
country's rural areas, and to invigorate the rural economy.
</P>
<P>
While inspecting northwest China's Gansu Province from June 29
to July 5, Zhu told local officials that the government's major
national policy is to solve food problems for most poor rural
residents by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the campaign of aiding the poor involves the rural
economy, agricultural development and the livelihoods of rural
residents. It is an important issue for narrowing the difference
between town and country, between workers and farmers, and between
different regions."
</P>
<P>
He went on to say: "If the rural economy in central and western
China which accounts for two-thirds of China's territory can not
grow rapidly, and if the earnings of rural residents in the area
cannot increase, state-owned manufacturers would lack the markets
on which they depend for development, and it would be impossible
for China to improve its overall economic returns and create a
socialist market economy."
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Gansu, Zhu, who is also a Standing Committee
member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee, visited farmer families in central Gansu, an
arid and underdeveloped area.
</P>
<P>
He told local farmers that the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee and the State Council, China's highest administrative
body, have taken effective and feasible measures to aid poor
areas in eliminating poverty.
</P>
<P>
He called on people in poor areas to do all they can to
eliminate poverty at an early date.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier also expressed support to the efforts of the
governments and people in arid area in northwest China to combine
the undertakings of major water-diversion projects with the control
of soil erosion in valleys.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Rongji also inspected the Liujiaxia Hydroelectric Power
Station on the Yellow River and a number of state-owned
enterprises, and held talks with executives of nine major
state-owned enterprises in the Gansu provincial capital of
Lanzhou.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is unrealistic to use one model, or one method,
to solve all problems overnight that state-owned enterprises have
encountered, because the problems are left over from history.
</P>
<P>
He promised the government has already taken, and will take, a
series of measures to help state-owned enterprises overcome their
difficulties.

immediately inform the police or the local administration," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Faisalabad blast is the eighth of its kind in Punjab
province since April this year, killing a total of about 80
people.
</P>
<P>
Nakai appreciated the traders and politicians of the city for
their role in the provision of relief and rescue services to the
people injured in the bomb blast on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Visiting the hospital where victims of the Monday bomb blast
are being treated, the chief minister inquired about the health of
the victims, especially those in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
The chief minister asked the hospital administration to take
every possible step for the early recovery of the injured.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 9 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin appointed
today Nikolai Kovalyov, a former career KGB officer, new head of
Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), said a statement issued
by the presidential press service.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Yeltsin met with Kovalyov in the Kremlin to
congratulate him upon the appointment and discuss future plans for
the agency.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Itar-Tass news agency, Kovalyov was
born in Moscow in 1949, and graduated from the city's Electronic
Chemistry Institute in 1972 before starting career in the Soviet KGB
in 1974.
</P>
<P>
He rose through the ranks and remained in service when the

Union.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets US President Assistant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin spoke
in Beijing today of the country's quest for a peaceful, stable and
prosperous world going into the next century.
</P>
<P>
The President said that China, a force for safeguarding world
peace and promoting the common development of the mankind, is
ready to make joint efforts along with peoples all over the world,
including the US, to realize the ideal.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark this afternoon at a meeting with Anthony
Lake, assistant to the US president for national security affairs.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to Lake, who is in China for the first
time, Jiang said he hoped that Lake's current visit will help
enhance mutual understanding between China and the US, and promote
the improvement and development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
It is the strong desire and common demand of all the peoples
around the world to safeguard world peace, promote a common
development, and create a new and beautiful world of peace and
stability, according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Facing such a situation at the coming of a new century, leaders
of all countries are considering what kind of a world should be
taken into the next century, which is also a question demanding
serious thought from leaders of both China and the US, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese Government has always paid much
attention to Sino-US relations, and there are still extensive
interests between the two countries, although the world situation
has experienced drastic changes.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the development of a sound Sino-US
relationship is not only in the interests of the two countries and
the two peoples, but also conducive to jointly creating a better
world, as well as peace and prosperity in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Based on this consideration, Jiang said, China holds that China
and the US should view and handle Sino-US relations from a
strategic height, oriented to the 21st century, to set up a
healthy, sound and stable relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Quoting an old Chinese saying as "sincerity will bring about
results", Jiang stressed that so long as China and the US have
that sincerity, adhere to commitments, and make joint efforts,
Sino-US relations can be improved and developed.
</P>
<P>
Lake said that one of his important objectives during the visit
is to discuss with Chinese colleagues on how to conduct strategic
dialogs between the two sides, that is the question about how to
establish a sound relationship between major countries in the next
century, in a bid to help build a peaceful and safe world.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that the US and China, as two great
countries, can play an important role in this process.
</P>
<P>
Lake also agreed with Jiang on Jiang's proposed principle in
handling US-China relations as enhancing mutual trust, decreasing
conflicts, developing cooperation and avoiding confrontation.
</P>
<P>
He said that so long as the two sides abide by the principle,
the two countries can establish normal and constructive relations.
</P>
<P>
Conveying US President Bill Clinton's greetings to Jiang, Lake
said that Clinton is expecting to meet with Jiang in Manila in
November this year.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his appreciation, Jiang said he is also expecting to
meet Clinton then, during the informal summit meeting of the APEC.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Foreign Affairs Office under the State Council
Liu Huaqiu, Vice-Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing, US Assistant
Secretary of State Winston Lord and US Ambassador to China James
R. Sasser, were present at the meeting.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Two South African astronomers
have for the first time measured the diameters of two variable
stars by using the Hubble space telescope (HST), the South
African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) announced today in Cape
Town.
</P>
<P>
Patricia Whitelock of the SAAO and Michael Feast of the
University of Cape Town, part of an international team including
two Italians using HST, made the difficult and accurate
measurements from space.
</P>
<P>
The stars measured were well-known variables in the
constellations of Leo, the lion and Hdra, the Water Monster.
</P>
<P>
Whitelock said: "We pick these particular stars because we
think they are very much like the kind of star our own sun."
</P>
<P>
"By studying them, we'll know more about what will happen to
our sun, and us, in the far distant future," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Feast said the stars behave in a strange way. "They
actually pulsate, getting bigger and smaller."
</P>
<P>
Feast also said they are continuing to take measurements with
the HST to see how much sizes and shapes of the stars changed in
the course of the year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets US President Assistant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said today
that Sino-US dialogue at various levels will help improve the
bilateral ties by enhancing understanding and abrogating
misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
He told Anthony Lake, assistant to the US president for
national security affairs, during their meeting in Beijing that
the dialogue should be carried out on the basis of mutual respect
and equality.
</P>
<P>
There is no reason for China and US, both great nations in the
world, not to live well with each other, he said, adding that the
leaders of the two countries, while dealing with the bilateral
ties, should be far-sighted, and proceed from the situation as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the two countries should increase contact, deepen
understanding, and expand cooperation. This is not only in the
interests of the peoples of the two countries, but beneficial to
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, and in the world
at large, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the development of the Sino-US trade ties has
maintained good trends, and the continuing, smooth and normal
two-way trade is also in the interests of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
China always holds that the two countries should solve problems
by cooperation through equal consultations, he said, adding that
the two governments should create a good political environment for
the cooperation between the business circles of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Lake said that his current China visit came at an important and
hopeful time for the development of Sino-US bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
It was encouraging that recently the US House of
Representatives approved, by a great margin, the unconditional
renewal of most-favored-nation trade status to China, he said. He
added that although the two countries should continue to solve
their differences, it is more important that they should establish
more constructive ties beyond those concrete differences.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining good relations between the US and China will play
an important role in establishing a new order, which will be
beneficial to all countries in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lake said the US has always held that a strong China is in the
interests of the US, and he spoke highly of the rapid development
of China's economy. Such progress had created big opportunities
for the development of the US-Chinese trade ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Strengthening the two way trade is one of the most important
aspects of the US-Chinese ties, and the US side would like to spur
the development of bilateral trade relations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the meeting were Liu Huaqiu, director of
the Foreign Affairs Office of the Chinese State Council; Li
Zhaoxing, Chinese vice-foreign minister; Winston Lord, assistant
secretary for east Asian and Pacific affairs of the US State
Department; and US Ambassador to China James Sasser.

<HEADLINE> New Thai Central Bank Governor Appointed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Caretaker Governor of the Bank of
Thailand Rerngchai Marakanond has been appointed new governor of
the bank today to succeed Vijit Supinit.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Bodi Chunnananda, who today informed the
cabinet of the appointment, said Rerngchai is an experienced and
capable banker.
</P>
<P>
Rerngchai, a former deputy governor, has been with the Central
Bank for many years.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say that his seniority at the bank is his
advantage, because he, as an insider, could command the support of
his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Vijit resigned last Tuesday under pressure because of his
failure to tackle problems associated with the Bangkok Bank of
Commerce (BBC) scandal.
</P>
<P>
Vijit was accused of moving too slowly to tackle the BBC's
problems. The BBC extended huge amounts of loans on overvalued
collaterals to politicians and to companies belonging to its own
executives. The BBC is now believed to have bad and doubtful debts
running to the tune of 78 billion baht (3.12 billion US dollars).

<P>
SEOUL, July 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea today remitted 6 million
U.S. dollars to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development
Organization (KEDO) as pre-project service costs for a light-water
reactor in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The amount given to KEDO's Secretariat, which takes up two
thirds of the estimated 9 million dollars required for the
pre-project service, was decided last March at the KEDO Executive
Board meeting in New York.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Japan donated three million U.S. dollars to the KEDO
for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
The KEDO, a multinational consortium led by the United States,
South Korea and Japan, is responsible for supplying two reactors
to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Under the Washington-Pyongyang framework agreement signed in
Geneva in October 1994, two 1,000-megawatt light-water nuclear
reactors will be provided to the DPRK in return for DPRK's
freezing of its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
The KEDO has selected South Korea as the prime supplier of the
light-water reactors.

TEHRAN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Turkey are to launch a
joint investigation in the Iranian border region attacked by
Turkish helicopters on June 26, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister said the agreement was reached
during visit to Tehran of Turkish Deputy Interior Minister Erol
Chaker.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said that the Turkish helicopter attack could be
confirmed or disproved after the investigation into the matter is

would be a pre-judgement.
</P>
<P>
On Tehran's ties with Ankara, he said relations between the two
neighboring countries, regardless of who leads the Turkish
government, have always been very important and sensitive.
</P>
<P>
The two countries had always favored mutual cooperation and
multilateral relations, free from any tension, he added.
</P>
<P>
Velayati noted that Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan
has always adopted a friendly stance toward Iran and since he is
in favor of having cordial ties with Islamic states "we are
looking forward to seeing more friendly ties between Iran and
Turkey in future."
</P>
<P>
On Monday evening after his arrival here, the Turkish official
said his government is ready to make compensation to Iran for its
recent attack which killed six Iranian nationals and wounded 15
others in the border region.

co-accused in the Chandraswami case.
</P>
<P>
London-based businessman Lakhubhai Pathak, a non-resident
Indian, has alleged that Chandraswami and his aide, Kailash Nath
Aggrawal Alias Mamaji, had cheated him of 100,000 US dollars on
false promises of awarding him a contract for supply of paper pulp
and newsprint in India.
</P>
<P>
The case took a new turn last week when businessman Pathak told
the court that he had paid the money to the godman only after Rao
assured him in 1983 in a New York hotel that his "work" would be
done.
</P>
<P>
Before making the promise to him, Rao, who was then the
external affairs minister in the Indira Gandhi cabinet, was
closeted with Chandraswami in the hotel room for over an hour,
Pathak said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, Chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, today expressed satisfaction with the development of
the Sino-Burundi relations, and hoped for expanding cooperation
between the two countries in various ways.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Nicolas Mayugi, state secretary of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Burundi, Li said
China attached much importance to its links with Burundi,
believing relations would develop on the basis of the existing
good ties.
</P>
<P>
Though China and Burundi are separated afar, and each has its
own specific conditions, they share or have similar views on major
international issues. It is a set policy of the Chinese government
to strengthen relations with Burundi and other African countries,
as well as all other developing countries. The Chinese government
thanked the Burundi government and its people for their support to
China on international issues.
</P>
<P>
"As old friends of Burundi, the Chinese people and the
government sincerely wish Burundi to develop its economy and
maintain social stability, and hope that the Burundi people under
the leadership of the Burundi government, can unite and join their
efforts to rebuilt their homeland," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed the guests on China's economic and social
development, and the ongoing reform and opening to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC leader said China is confident in solving the
existing problems, such as poor agricultural infrastructure, low
efficiency of state-owned enterprises, and poor social order in
some areas.
</P>
<P>
Mayugi said he was honored to have met with Chairman Li for the
third time. Burundi and China have a deep-rooted friendship which
has stood various tests, he said, adding that the Chinese people
and government were always on the Burundi side in the most
difficult periods.
</P>
<P>
And in the United Nations, China opposed the armed intervention
by foreign power into Burundi's internal affairs, thus maintaining
the integrity of sovereignty of Burundi, Mayugi noted. "For this,
the Burundi people are sincerely grateful to the Chinese people."
he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharing Li Ruihuan's view on bilateral relations, Mayugi said
the friendship between Burundi and China has been developing
continuously since the two countries forged links diplomatically
in 1962.
</P>
<P>
Mayugi promised that the Burundi government would always
support China in major international issues, and support China's
stand in realizing its national reunification.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen Meets British Entrepreneurs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen said in Beijing today that there is every
reason to believe that a smooth transition will be realized in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Meeting a delegation from John Swire and Sons, led by its
company group Chairman Sir Adrian Swire, Qian said that the vast
majority of Hong Kong residents and entrepreneurs hope to achieve
the goal.
</P>
<P>
"This desire is bound to become true," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He said the continuing maintenance of Hong Kong's stability and
prosperity conforms not only to the interests of the whole of
China, including Hong Kong, but also to the interests of the
investors of Britain, and other foreign countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed his appreciation for the British company's
extensive involvement in Hong Kong's business and investment,
adding that John Swire and Sons has long taken Hong Kong as its
place for business, and established its Swire Pacific headquarters
there, showing its positive attitude towards Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
This will be beneficial not only to the business development of
the British company itself, but also to Hong Kong's stability
and prosperity, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian also noted the cooperative attitude that John Swire and
Sons has taken in issues concerning its shares in Dragonair, and
the Hong Kong-Taiwan air route, adding: "We appreciate this."
</P>
<P>
The Vice-Premier stressed that after 1997, China will implement
the principle of "one country, two systems" towards Hong
Kong. This is not an expedient measure, and the earnest
implementation of this principle will be conducive to keeping Hong
Kong's position as an international financial, trade and shipping
center.

"John Swire and Sons, and other foreign companies, are welcome
to remain in Hong Kong to make fresh contributions to Hong Kong's

Swire said his company has full confidence in the development
of the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, and will put the stress
mainly on Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland in its future
business development.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters of Swire Pacific, a major company under John
Swire and Sons, will continue to stay in Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
Swire said he was satisfied with the settlement of the two
issues, one about its shares in Dragonair, the other about the
Hong Kong-Taiwan air route.
</P>
<P>
Swire noted that John Swire and Sons has a great amount of
investment in the construction of the new airport in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that after its completion, the new
airport will be the best airport in Asia, and a hub of
communications in the region.
</P>
<P>
This will bring good to both Britain and China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Swire said John Swire and Sons has invested a total of about
700 million U.S. dollars in the Chinese mainland, used mainly in
projects of beverages, paints, sugar refining and container wharfs.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that we have the confidence in China's future," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Wives of Western Hostages Seek Release of Their </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The wives of the two Western
hostages made an emotional appeal here today for the release of
their husbands.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference, Jane Schelly Hutchings,
accompanied by Julie Mangan, whose husbands were kidnapped a year
ago by a group called Al-Faran in India-held Kashmir, said, "let
my husband, let Julie's husband, let the others go."
</P>
<P>
Al-Faran, a little-known group who called themselves freedom
fighters of the Kashmiri people, kidnapped five Western tourists
and demanded the release of some Kashmiris held by the Indian
government in exchange of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
One Norwegian hostage has been beheaded while the fate of the
other four are still not sure.
</P>
<P>
"All we want is to know about our loved ones; we want to know
where our husbands are," said soft-speaking Mrs. Hutchings, who
fought hard to control herself.
</P>
<P>
"We have heard nothing from our husbands for many months. We do
not know where they are, we do not know how they are. We do not
even know if they are still alive."
</P>
<P>
"From the bottom of our hearts, we ask each one of you, if you
have seen Donald (Hutchings) or Keith (Mangan), if you know
anything about them or the other hostages, or if you know any way
we can contact them, please, please find a way to let us know."
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Hutchings, a school teacher, and Mrs. Mangan, a baker,
traveled to both India and Pakistan to seek help from the
governments and other groups involved for the release of their
husbands and the other two hostages.
</P>
<P>
They met Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto during their
stay here and the prime minister assured them the support and help
of the Pakistani government.
</P>
<P>
Allah Baksh, father of Mohammad Masood Azhar, one of the people
Al-Faran seeks to be released in exchange of the Western hostages,
has sent a message appealing for the release of the held-up
Western tourists.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal in the name of Almighty Allah that those people
should not care for my son and should release the innocent
hostages," said the father.
</P>
<P>
During the press conference, Mrs. Mangan read out a message for
their husbands and the other two hostages, asking them to "remain
strong."
</P>
<P>
"Through this ordeal, support, look after, and nurture each
other," she said, adding, "be steadfast friends and a tremendous
support to each other."

<HEADLINE> S.Leone's Girl Student Needs Urgent Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Doctors in the capital of Sierra
Leone are battling to save the life of a 14-year-old secondary
school student, Katty Sillah who has a bullet lodged in her head.
</P>
<P>
The team of doctors today made a "passionate" appeal to donor
agencies and humanitarian organizations for assistance to fly
Katty overseas as the operation is not available in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
According to Sulaiman Jah, National Chairman of the Relief
and Rehabilitation Agency, Katty, who is a war displaced student
attending the Saint Joseph's Secondary School in Freetown, "took
advantage of the current ceasefire (between the Sierra Leonean
government and the Revolutionary United Front) and joined
a private car to travel to Bo (in the south) to spend part of
her holidays."
</P>
<P>
She unfortunately fell into a rebel ambush between Bo and
Taiama where she was shot in the head on June 28, Jah said.
</P>
<P>
Katty was rescued by government troops and taken to the Bo
government hospital and it was discovered on July 4 that a bullet
was lodged in her head.
</P>
<P>
She was flown to the capital and is now admitted at the
Intensive Care Unit of the Cannaught Hospital.
</P>
<P>
According to medical and x-ray reports, there is a bullet
deep in Katty's drain which needs to be removed urgently by an
operation which cannot be done in Sierra Leone, said Jah.
</P>
<P>
Family sources said today Katty lost her mother a year
ago in a rebel attack in the south while her father,
Emmanuel Sillah is internally displaced and resident at the
Gondama Displaced Camp in Bo.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of people preparing to
travel for sightseeing during summer holidays is expected to
increase by some 40 percent this year, following the opening of an

<HEADLINE> Somali Islam Group Claims Attacking Ethiopian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Islamic radical group AL-Itihad
Al-Islam said here today it was responsible for the armed attack
on Abdulmajid Hussein, Transportd and Communication Minister of the
Ethiopian government on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for AL-Itihad in Mogadishu, Abdulkadir Mohamud
Dhaqane, said his group has carried out the attack which he
described as a prudent measure against what he called the
obstacles to independence in the eastern region of Ethiopia
inhabited By the Somalis.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, speaking to reporters in South Mogadishu today,
has accused the Ethiopian minister of dividing the Somali
community in Zone fifth of Ethiopia and creating unrest in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also termed as illegitimate the political party
chaired By Abdulmajid, Ethiopian Somali Democratic League (ESDL),
the strongest party in fifth zone Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Dhaqane threatened that they will continue their attacks on
Ethiopia's high-ranking officials and their guerrilla fighting in
the eastern region until Zone fifth attains independence from
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"Abdulmajid will not escape next time although he survives
this attack," said Dhaqane who admitted that 18 other senior
officials are in his targeted list and will be executed soon.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic extremist group of Al-Itihad earlier claimed the
responsibility of a series of explosions which occurred in Addis
Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, in January and February this
year.
</P>
<P>
Dhaqane said his organization has carred out the bomb attacks
in Ghion and Ras hotels in Addis Ababa in which four people were
killed and more than 20 others wounded in February.
</P>
<P>
Dhaqane has also claimed that his group were responsible for
the killing of senior military official in the Defense Ministry
of Ethiopia, Brigader General Haylom Ariya on February 14 in
Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
He said like those in Eritrea, Somalis in eastern Ethiopia
must have their own rights for national referendum where the
people can decide their future determination.
</P>
<P>
The supporters of Al-Itihad Al-Islam have found strong bases
along the border regions between Somalia and Ethiopia for more
than five years.
</P>
<P>
The Moslem extremists benefitting from the anarchy in Somalia
have collected a lot of weapons and ammunition. They also have
many bases in Somalia including Luq and Qardho districts and Hawd
reserve area of Somaliland, the break away republic of Somalia.
Al-Itihad has many religious followers among the youngsters from
many different regions of Somalia.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's counter-intelligence
police on Monday discovered an underground "telephone office"
which has caused millions of dollars of loss to the country's
telecommunications departments, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The office, which was stationed in a tall building in the
residential quarters of the capital, made a huge sum of money by
secretly dealing with internal and international telephone
businesses through its own networks which spread almost all over
Europe, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The office, equipped with the most advanced equipment, has its
own subscribers and offered cheap service to them in Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian police have been cooperating with police of other
countries concerned to find the office.
</P>
<P>
Weapons have been found in the headquarters of the office, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
From the detained files the police found that the office is
installing satellite instruments which can connect them wirelessly
with the whole world.
</P>
<P>
The police suspect that some people in the Bulgarian
Telecommunications Bureau might have close connection with the
office.

<HEADLINE> Operations Against Smuggling Stepped Up in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The anti-smuggling unit of the
Uganda revenue authority (URA) has stepped up operations along
the eastern border due to increased smuggled goods in the
country, reported the local daily "the New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
A source from the URA was quoted as saying that the operations
were temporarily halted mid-April this year when the campaign for
presidency was carried out due to political pressures.
</P>
<P>
"Some politicians here had taken advantage of our
operations to make political capital out of it as well as
decampaign government policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But now that the dust has settled, we have revitalized our
machinery and we are ready to deal with any person found
smuggling," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "we halted our operations because some politicians
were protecting smugglers arguing that their political opponents
were behind the impounding of each others' goods."
</P>
<P>
The source disclosed that the unit has deployed its personneln
along the border areas of Busia, Malaba and patrol boats on lake
Victoria.
</P>
<P>
Billions of Shillings (1,050 Ugandan Shillings equal to one
U.S. Dollar) are lost in revenue collection yearly through
smuggled goods in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Some local manufacturers have since April expressed concern on
the increase of smuggled goods which they said undermined their
production capacity.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Security Committee Plans Next Steps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Members of the ministerial
committee of the summit of the Great Lakes region on Burundi will
have to visit Burundi for consultations, before taking any
practical initiatives for a deployment of forces.
</P>
<P>
Edgar Maokola-majogo, Minister of State for Defense and
National Service told reporters here on Monday that the committee
headed by Tanzania, would present their proposals as for security
arrangements envisaged for Burundi and then proceed to brief the
rulers there.
</P>
<P>
He said, the committee was on the final stages of drafting
proposed arrangements, but the way in which the proposals would
be approved had not been decided, whether it would be in the form
of another summit, consultations or a normal meeting at lower
levels than the Heads of State.
</P>
<P>
"It is after this meeting that the committee will go to
Burundi for consultations with the government, as it is the one
which asked for the assistance," he said, expressing the hope
that after the consultations were finalized it should be possible
to deploy the forces in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian minister of state said, if the Burundi
authorities inform the committee that the type of assistance and
the proposed arrangements were not needed there, the committee
would call on the Heads of State for a decision.
</P>
<P>
"But no matter what the committee will be told in Burundi, the
international community will not sit back to watch killings go on
in that country," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Security assistance aimed for this central African state of
Burundi is not only meant to help the government but to create
conditions for ensuring peace for all sectors of the population in
that country, according to the Tanzanian minister.
</P>
<P>
In case the Heads of State decide to send army units into
Burundi it will not be Tanzanian army units but internationally
units in which Tanzania shall only participate.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's New Means to Recover Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's National Electric Power
Authority (NEPA), the state-owned electricity supplier, has
engaged the services of the military to recover a staggering 2.4
billion Naira (28 million US Dollars) debt owned by three states.
</P>
<P>
The difficulty in the recovery of the debt by consumers in
Oyo, Ogun and Osun states, all in southwestern Nigeria adjacent
to Lagos, has led to the establishment of a special task force
comprising the military, police and NEPA personnel for the
exercise.
</P>
<P>
The development was confirmed by Augustine Orie, newly
redeployed district manager for Ibadan, capital of Oyo state, who
said it has got to a stage NEPA's efforts alone could not
guarantee the objectives.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the military personnel would move from house
to house and from company to company to collect its bills and
disconnect whenever a debtor failed to pay on the spot.
</P>
<P>
The debtors in Oyo state include state government, industrial,
commercial and residential consumers, as well as the big-name
University of Ibadan, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Developing member countries of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) should carefully handle
"extraneous issues" included in the WTO agenda such as the
environment, Malaysian Minister of International Trade and
Industry Rafidah Aziz said at a conference here today.
</P>
<P>
She urged developing countries to be vigilant in ensuring that
developed countries do not turn extraneous issues into
"protectionist tools."
</P>
<P>
She said that when people in a group are not alert enough,
others might bring in extraneous matters.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah warned participants of the WTO ministerial conference
scheduled for Singapore in December this year not to be distracted
by other issues, such as multilateral investment rules, labor
standards and bribery, which the developed nations planned to
include into the WTO conference work programs.
</P>
<P>
She said developing countries should not allow the WTO agenda
to include the proposal to give similar national treatment to all
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah noted that the WTO conference should give priority to
reviewing the implementation of the Uruguay Round commitments as
well as focusing on the areas specified in the built-in agenda.

<HEADLINE> Italy Happy About Helping Promote Europe-Asia Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Italy is happy to have helped bring
about the Europe-Asia summit in the capacity of the rotating
presidency of the European Union (EU) for the first half of 1996,
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said today.
</P>
<P>
The summit held on March 1-2 in Bangkok, Thailand, the first of
its kind between government leaders of Europe and Asia, marks the
beginning of a new relationship between the two regions, Dini told
a press conference of Italian and foreign reporters today when
summarizing his country's work as EU's rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
The positive results achieved in this summit are not only in
the field of economy and trade but also in the field of politics,
Dini added.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the relations between China and the EU as well
as Italy, Dini said that the EU and Italy have attached great
importance as always to their relations with China because China's
economic reform has achieved great results.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of human rights, Dini said that the EU and Italy
noticed that China has made great progress on this issue.
</P>
<P>
But of course, there are still some differences on this issue
between Europe and China due to different traditions.
</P>
<P>
However, the differences do not mean that China and Europe
including Italy can not develop cooperative relations.
</P>
<P>
As for his position on the Helms-Burton law, which the United
States adopted to isolate Cuba in retaliation for the shooting
down of two U.S. registered aircraft by Cubans, Dini said that the
EU is very worried and concerned about the fact that the law will
be put into operation as from August 11.
</P>
<P>
Under the American law, Cuban commodities are forbidden to
enter the U.S. market through other countries and the United
States has the right to punish the companies that do business with
Cuban firms.
</P>
<P>
If the EU member states are involved in the law, the identical
reply of Europe will be negative.
</P>
<P>
During the press conference, Dini also answered questions about
the reform of the United Nations, the peace process in Middle
East, the situation in Bosnia, Iraq and Algeria and the expansion
of the EU.
</P>
<P>
The current EU presidency is Ireland.

NAIROBI, July 9 (Xinhua) --All housing projects have been
suspended in Kenya's capital of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Nairobi Town Clerk H. Oluoch on Monday announced to stop the
constructin of houses in the capital with immediate effect. The
move is to vet the house construction plans made by the Town
Planning Committee.

He said "Housing construction must be stopped forthwith and
the plans brought to the council for vetting."

werecoming up without the knowledge of the city council, he

<HEADLINE> PA Officials Reject Police Summons in East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority (PA)
officials in East Jerusalem have refused to comply with Israeli
police summons for questioning, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem police Monday summoned at least seven members of the
legislative Palestinian Council (PC) to the police station today,
to warn them against violating the ban on PA activity in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The seven PC members include Abu Ala, the PC Speaker, and
Hanan Ashrawi, a prominent Palestinian woman activist and
Minister of Education in the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
Infuriated by the move, Ziyad Abu Ziyad, one of the summoned,
said: "We have been elected to a council set up under an
agreement between Israel and the PLO, and the Israeli police have
no right to summon us and try to intimidate us."
</P>
<P>
He described the move as his first personal experience with
the new Israeli government's policy in East Jerusalem, saying that
"If this is the spirit of the new Israeli government, then things
look very bad."
</P>
<P>
He said: "If the Israeli authorities have a message for us,
they surely know the proper channel is through the liaison
office."
</P>
<P>
The right-wing Likud government has declared that it is obliged
to accept the Oslo agreement although it resents it. Therefore it
will do its best to lessen its bad effects. Particularly, it will
not tolerate PA activity in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Police sources confirmed that they known the PA officials
would not come, but believed the summons itself would serve as a
warning to them not to violate the ban on PA activity in
the city.
</P>
<P>
The PA officials were each given a specific time to report to
the minorities division of the Jerusalem police department, which
deals with security matters in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo agreement, Israel and the PLO would take up the
issue of Jerusalem in the final status talks between the two
sides. But the hardline Likud government has made it clear since
its rise to power that in no way will it negotiate Jerusalem with
the Palestinians. It has declared that Jerusalem is Israel's
eternal and undivided capital and the Jewish state has exclusive
sovereignty over the city.

<HEADLINE> OAU Removes Sanctions on Gambia, Guinea Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African Unity
(OAU) today announced the removal of its sanctions on Gambia and
Guinea Bissau as they have endeavored to clear part of their
membership dues owed to the regional body.
</P>
<P>
"Now, Gambia and Guinea Bissau have the capacity to exercise
their rights to speak and vote at the OAU forum, and have the full
capacity as OAU members," announced an OAU spokesman during the
ongoing summit meeting held in Yaounde, Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting which entered into the second day today,
Gambia paid one million U.S. Dollars and Guinea Bissau paid
450,000 U.S. Dollars in membership dues to clear part of their
arrears owed to OAU.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, four countries including Chad, Comoros, Zaire and
Djibouti have paid "a good amount of contributions" of the OAU
membership dues to enable themselves to become the "good boys".
</P>
<P>
"The situation is getting better," said Ibrahim Dagash, press
officer of the OAU secretariat, explaining that the number of OAU
member states under sanctions for serious arrears, have been
reduced to six as of today from 13 before the opening of the 64th
council of minister meeting on July 4.
</P>
<P>
The six OAU member countries in heavy arrears and still under
sanctions are Cape Verde, Equatorial Guinea, Central African
Republic, Sao Tome and Principe, Niger and Seychelles.
</P>
<P>
Four other countries whose economies have been virtually
destroyed by years of civil war, including Liberia, Sierra Leone,
Burundi and Somali, are enjoying membership due exemptions.
</P>
<P>
Under the OAU rules, member states placed under sanctions are
not allowed to speak or vote at OAU meetings until they pay up.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the ongoing OAU 32nd summit meeting, held from
July 8 to 10, is the best time for African countries to "show
their solidarity" and pay up their contributions to the
continental body.
</P>
<P>
The arrears problem has limited the scope of functions of the
OAU which is eager to expand its roles in stepping up
peacekeeping and regional economic integration in the region.
</P>
<P>
OAU is considering withdrawing or reducing its observers
mission in Burundi partly because of the limited operational
fund.
</P>
<P>
In Liberia, the peacekeeping role is largely played by the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
And the first session of the Economic and Social Commission of
the African Economic Community (AEC), a key instrument in the
implementation of the Abuja treaty which set up the AEC, has been
delayed time and again, mainly due to the lack of fund.

Ministry was quoted in Monday's Business Times as saying.
</P>
<P>
The parks are found in both the north and south, and go from
cold to warm and hot climate zones, such as Tianchi Lake in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Zhejiang's
Qiandao Lake, and Zhangjiajie. They are used for vacationing,
outings, camping, scientific research, and expeditions.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the massive afforestation, protection, and fire
control efforts, Zhangjiajie has a 97 percent vegetation rate, and
accounts for half of the gross national product in the area.
</P>
<P>
To improve management of the parks, the Forestry Ministry set
up a special office for forest park construction and management in
1992 and developed China's first regulation for supervision.
</P>
<P>
Forest tourism study has also become a special field of study
at Beijing Forestry University, Northeast Forestry University, and
at Central South China Forestry Institute, the official said.

<HEADLINE> 6.7 Billion Yuan to Be Used to Ease Capital Crunch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua)-- The Construction Bank of China, the
country's main financer of construction investment, will provide
6.7 billion yuan in loans to large state enterprises to increase
production.
</P>
<P>
They will be used as working capital for 31 state firms in the
petrochemical, power, building materials, metallurgy, textile,
electronics, transportation, and aviation industries.
</P>
<P>
This is the second group of loans the bank has made to shore up
fund-strapped state enterprises since the central bank decided to
ease the credit crunch, especially for pillar state industries,
late last month.
</P>
<P>
Those which benefit most are large state firms that include
China's leading TV set manufacturer -- Shaanxi Caihong (Rainbow)
Group Inc., the Xian Aircraft Industrial Group, the Handan Iron &AMP;
Steel Plant, and an oil refinery in Fujian Province and a cement
works in Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
According to bank officials, this is one of the concrete
measures financial authorities have taken to help the reform of
large state enterprises, which have long been plagued by a
shortage of funds and burgeoning bank debts.
</P>
<P>
A bank official notes, however, "we are selective, our clients
must have good prospects and sound management to ensure the safety
and profitability of our credit."
</P>
<P>
The bank has signed cooperation agreements with about one
hundred such enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets Senior US Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen has expressed the hope that the current visit
of Anthony Lake, assistant to the US president for national
security affairs, will help promote mutual understanding between
China and the United States and improve their bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Anthony Lake here today, Qian noted
that Lake's visit comes at a critical moment in Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
Lake said that he is very glad to have the opportunity to visit
China for the first time, and that it is really an important and
hopeful time for the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The US side would like to establish constructive, normal ties
with China through high-level contacts and dialogue at various
levels, he said, adding that one of the important objectives of
his visit is to explore ways of making strategic dialogues with
China, especially on how to establish close cooperation among big
nations in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Since the United States hopes that a strong China will benefit
world peace in the next century, it attaches great importance to
its ties with China, he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that recently the US House of Representatives
approved by a great margin the unconditional granting of
most-favored-nation trade status to China. This, he noted,
demonstrates that to some extent, the US Congress has reached a
decision about paying attention to US-Chinese ties. The US side
hopes that, based on this progress, the development of bilateral
ties can be further promoted, Lake said.
</P>
<P>
Lake also disclosed that US Secretary of State Warren
Christopher is looking forward to his meeting with Qian during the
ASEAN meeting in late July.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that China agrees with the idea that constructive
dialogue between China and the US should be held to discuss some
strategic problems concerning global development.
</P>
<P>
After the end of the cold war, it is important to set up normal
ties between countries, based on major principles of international
relations, such as mutual trust, equality, and mutual benefits, he
said, and that if this can be done, it is possible to avoid world
wars and conflicts like those of the past, and a more peaceful
world will result in the next century. China and the US, as two
great nations, should play an important role in this process, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier also said that China places great importance
on bilateral ties, and hopes to have stable and constructive
relations with the US. Although there are some differences between
the two countries, they can be properly solved if the two sides,
examining the situation as a whole, respect each other and seek
common ground, while maintaining differences, based on a sense of
equality, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian also said that he would like to exchange views with
Christopher on Sino-US ties and issues of common concern, during
their upcoming meeting in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Among those present in the meeting were Liu Huaqiu, director of
the Foreign Affairs Office of the State Council; Li Zhaoxing,
Chinese vice-foreign minister; Winston Lord, assistant secretary
for east Asian and Pacific affairs of the US State Department; and
US Ambassador to China James Sasser.

<HEADLINE> Big-Screen Color TV Sets Sell Well in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Better off Chinese families are
turning their homes into mini-cinemas - by snapping up big screen
television sets.
</P>
<P>
Lower prices, better living conditions and increased incomes
have made big-screen color TV sets (at or above 25 inches)
hot-selling items in China in the past year, "China Machinery and
Electronics Daily" has reported.
</P>
<P>
Statistics collected from the country's department stores show
that sales of big-screen color TV sets rose 2.3 times in 1995 from
the previous year, and the growth rate in the first five months of
this year was 1.7 times higher than the corresponding period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year big-screen color TV sets
accounted for one-third of the total color TV sets sold in shops
in China.
</P>
<P>
In March color TV manufacturer Changhong, which is famous
across the country, took the lead by cutting its price and scaled
down the price again in June, resulting in a daily national sale
of 400 sets since then.
</P>
<P>
Many other color TV manufacturers and dealers have one after
another offered marketing tactics such as narrowing profit margins
and increasing discount rates.
</P>
<P>
Big-name overseas color TV manufacturers like Samsung, Toshiba,
Philip and Matsushita have all lowered their prices by about five
percent on average.
</P>
<P>
One of the major reasons for brisk sale of big-screen color TV
sets is that about 70 percent of the Chinese families who bought
color TV sets during the 1980s will replace the old sets in the
next few years, according to the paper.

<P>
KUNMING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A set of two souvenir badges have
been put on sale in the capital city of Yunnan Province to mark
the 625th birthday of the Chinese sailor, Zheng He.
</P>
<P>
The remarkable sailor was born in Yunnan on July 11, 1371. From
the year 1405 to 1433, he sailed more than 50,000 km on seven
voyages to 39 Asian and African countries.
</P>
<P>
He led a large Chinese fleet to seas west of China, such as
near Java, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and to as far away as
the east coast of Africa.
</P>
<P>
It was not until some 80 years later that Columbus discovered
the American continent.
</P>
<P>
The souvenir badges are one-tenth of an ounce gold and half an
ounce of silver and are being produced by the Shanghai Mint. Their
obverse sides bear an image of Zheng He and the reverse side has a
picture of his ship.

<HEADLINE> More Cultural Relics Unearthed in Three Gorges Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Four rubbish pits from the Late Stone
Age and two tombs from the Spring and Autumn period (770-476 BC)
have been unearthed in Zigui County, in central China's Hubei
Province.
</P>
<P>
The sites are among some 1,000 historical ones in the Three
Gorges area. These sites will be submerged after the Three Gorges
Project, China's largest water conservation program, is finished.
</P>
<P>
In the newly-discovered sites, Chinese archaeologists unearthed
pottery, stoneware, and animal and fish bones. They say that the
pottery and stoneware date from the Longshan Culture some 4,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Longshan cultural objects, first found at Chengziya in east
China's Shandong Province, were mainly well polished stone and
shell ware and gray pottery.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the new finds are the first relics
representing this kind of culture found in the Three Gorges area.
</P>
<P>
In one of the discovered tombs bronze weapons and pottery jars
were unearthed.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the weapons are in the Ba style but the tomb
and pottery are in the Chu style. Ba and Chu were people who lived
in the Three Gorges area some 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
A rubbish pit from the middle Western Zhou Dynasty (11th
Century-771 BC) was also found in the county, with pottery in it.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the pit will help the study of the ancient Kui
State which was located in the county during that time period.

<HEADLINE> Rare Relics Unearthed from Tomb on Silk Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Most valuable pottery from the
Tang Dynasty (618-907) and exquisite porcelain and glassware from
Eastern Rome have been unearthed in a tomb alongside China's
ancient Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
The gilded and painted pottery are two animal figures and two
warriors serving as guards of the tomb, which, according to
Chinese archaeologists, represent the highest artistic level of
Tang pottery.
</P>
<P>
The foreign porcelain and glassware are a clue to exchanges
between China and the West, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
The tomb is located in Guyuan County, in northwest China's
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and belonged to Shi Daoluo, a
Sogdian living in Middle Asia in ancient times who migrated to
China during the Northern Dynasties (386-581). He and his father
and brother were officials during the Tang.
</P>
<P>
His brother was an imperial interpreter, the only interpreter
whose name has been recorded in Chinese historical documents.
</P>
<P>
The father and brother's tombs, located nearby, were excavated
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The recent excavation was conducted by a Sino-Japanese team
which got a financial assistance of 14 million yen from the
Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
The team is now excavating another tomb in the county, which
belonged to Tian Hong from the Northern Zhou Dynasty
(557-581). The name of the tomb occupant can also be found in
historical documents.

<HEADLINE> WHO Steps up "Africa 2000" Initiative at OAU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) is stepping up its "Africa 2000" initiative as the health
situation in Africa still faces daunting challenges, WHO Director
General Hiroshi Nakajima said here today.
</P>
<P>
"In allocating the regular budget for 1996-1997, special
consideration has been given to the needs of Africa," Hiroshi
told Xinhua in an interview during the ongoing summit meeting of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Among WHO's 1996-1997 budget of 843 million U.S. Dollars, 154
million Dollars will be spent to improve the health situation in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
And according to the WHO chief, he has brought with him to the
OAU summit an addition budget of 7.4 million Dollars which was
approved to enhance the "Africa 2000" initiative.
</P>
<P>
"This program is aimed at controlling and eradicating some of
the biggest killer diseases and improve the general health
situation in Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fighting HIV/AIDS is the most daunting challenge facing
Africa, according to him.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 13 million adults in African countries south of Sahara
are currently infected with the disease and are still alive, said
the WHO chief, adding that to his knowledge, up to 60 percent of
the general hospital beds in some places such as Uganda, have
been occupied by AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
Hiroshi said his organization, in cooperation with other
international agencies, is now making progress in the un-AIDS
program to fight the most dangerous killer disease in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
Other disease which WHO hopes to take control include ebola,
tuberculosis, meningitis, etc.
</P>
<P>
And other programs of the "Africa 2000" include the
eradication of polio, river blindness, poliomyelitis, guinea
worms, leprosy, dracunculiasis, malaria, among others. "Today we
have the means and opportunity to eradicate them from Africa," he
promised.
</P>
<P>
"The picture before us is not very rosy," said Hiroshi, adding
his organization would step up its implementation of the
initiative created in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 WHO health indicators showed that life expectancy for
sub-Saharan Africa at 50-51 years compared to 74 years in the
developed regions.
</P>
<P>
Infant mortalityy, estimated for sub-Saharan Africa at 101
infant deaths per 1000 births, is seven times more than the
developed world, while the maternal mortality, estimated at 717
per 100,000 live births in sub-Saharan Africa, is 28 times higher
than the developed nations.
</P>
<P>
"In fighting the war, we are calling for prompt and active
response from the governments, the non-governmental organizations
and the people in Africa," he said.

Abacha, who was expected to have arrived in the Cameroonian
capital of Yaounde, the venue of the summit, since Sunday, was
reported to have cancelled the trip for an undisclosed reason,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
''This development may have necessitated a recall of the head
of state's advance party to Yaounde yesterday,'' the Nigerian
Tribune newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The aborted trip is however, said the newspaper, believed to
have been informed by the mounting hostility between Nigeria and
Cameroun over the Bakassi peninsula as all peace initiatives to
resolve the dispute have been thwarted by the Cameroonian
government.

<P>
But Abacha was still being expected to arrive for the meeting
as at last night, the Punch newspaper said.

<P>
Nigeria's Head of State was also absent during last year's

<P>
HANOI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A recent official survey showed that
Vietnam's present population is about 75 million and the annual
birth rate in the country was 2.53 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Minister Mai Ky, Chairperson of the National
Committee on Population and Family Planning (NCPFP), Vietnam's

NCPFP has closely monitored three key zones, the Red River
delta, the central coast, and the Mekong delta. In these areas the
committee has carried out various programmes such as improving the
capacity of family planning (fp) teams, especially on mass
education and population growth information.
</P>
<P>
With state funds, NCPFP has built 627 new inter-communal fp
service centres to raise the total number to 1,189 nation-wide,
and has constructed or upgraded 2,025 communal dispensaries with
an fp section.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to control population growth rate at 1.7
percent per annum, birth rate at 2.3 percent, average number of
children per family at 2.8-2.9.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2,000, seventy percent of the couples must be using

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Approves Creation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Knesset (Israel's
parliament), in a vote of 50-33 Monday night, approved the
establishment of the Ministry of National Infrastructure, with
Likud's hardliner Ariel Sharon as its minister.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delayed his departure to the
U.S. for several hours in order to announce the establishment of
the ministry and the appointment of Sharon as the minister.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, former defense and housing minister, sworn in as
the last member to join the new government, bringing to an
end to the coalition crisis following Foreign Minister David
Levy's threat to quit the cabinet if Sharon does not join
the cabinet by the time Netanyahu flies to the U.S. for a visit.
</P>
<P>
The jurisdiction of the powerful infrastructure ministry, a
new creation custom-tailored for Sharon by Levy, will include
Israel's Lands Administration, parts of the Water Administration,
railways and ports, national sewage project, and the Public Works
Department.
</P>
<P>
Sharon will also be responsible for negotiations with
neighboring states and the Palestinians on water resources.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the Knesset plenum, Netanyahu presented
the request for the new ministry and praised Sharon, saying
Sharon would make an important contribution not only in the
field under the ministry's jurisdiction, but also on security
issues.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also made use of the opportunity to promote his trip
to the U.S. and discuss the planned economic cuts, stressing that
the economic program was a one-off decision to put the economy
back on the right track.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet Sunday approved the Treasury's plan for a
massive budget cut, which was presented for a comprehensive
blueprint for slashing government expenditures in 1997 by 4.9
billion shekels (about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told the Knesset that without the program, the nation
would suffer greatly from rampant inflation, which would have hit
the weaker sectors in particular.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister repeated his stand in favor of market
liberalization and privatization, saying the economic reform would
 help attract foreign investors, and he would be able to
encourage this during his trip to the U.S..
</P>
<P>
According Israel's basic law, the Knesset must approve the
final 1997 budget no later than October 28.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu later boarded the plane for the U.S. and was
scheduled to arrive in Washington after midnight. This is his
first official visit to the U.S. since he became Israel's first
directly elected prime minister following his May 29 election
victory.
</P>
<P>
This morning, he will have a two-hour meeting with
U.S. President Bill Clinton on various issues, and then hold a
joint press conference in the White House.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is also scheduled to meet separately with Secretary
of State Warren Christopher, Defense Secretary William Perry, and
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.
</P>
<P>
He will also meet today with the Jewish Institute for
National Security Affairs, which was occasionally on the outs
with the former Labor government because it questioned the
placing of U.S. troops on the Golan Heights to monitor a
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is due to return to Israel late Saturday night
after concluding his five-day visit to the U.S.
