<HEADLINE> Babbitt Called Before Grand Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt was called  
today before a grand jury in connection with the investigation into 
whether campaign funds influenced a decision in 1995 to reject an 
Indian casino in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-month investigation by Independent Counsel Carol Elder  
Bruce reportedly was moving toward conclusion. It was Babbitt's 
first appearance before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Department spokesman Mike Gauldin said he could not  
comment on the case, referring questions to Babbitt's personal 
lawyer, Lloyd Cutler. Cutler could not immediately be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The special counsel is looking into whether promises of campaign  
contributions to the Democratic Party influenced the Interior 
Department decision in 1995 to reject a request by three Chippewa 
tribes to open a casino in Hudson, Wis. Other tribes opposing the 
casino later contributed nearly $300,000 to the Democratic National 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt has vigorously denied any connection between campaign  
contributions and the decision to reject the casino permit. 
</P>
<P>
	But a longtime friend, Paul Eckstein, who was a lobbyist for the  
tribes seeking the casino, testified at congressional hearings that 
Babbitt alluded to Democratic campaign contributions and pressure 
from the White House during a meeting on the day the casino 
decision was made. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the questions the special counsel is trying to answer is  
whether Babbitt lied before Congress when he described the events 
leading up to the casino decision. Babbitt has said Eckstein 
misunderstood the conversation and has denied misleading lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce was believed to be wrapping up her investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	The Minneapolis Star Tribune report today that Bruce anticipates  
completing the fact-gathering part of the investigation by 
mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce has asked the U.S. attorney in Madison, Wis., for an  
additional 60-day delay of a federal court suit involving the 
casino issue, so she could wrap up her own fact-finding, according 
to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are nearing the end of our factual investigation and are in  
the process of reviewing the facts and the law in order to reach a 
final conclusion as to whether any indictment(s) should be 
sought,'' Bruce wrote, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. attorney in Wisconsin represents the Interior  
Department in the lawsuit brought by the Indian tribes who had 
sought the casino permit.

<HEADLINE> Medicaid Limits Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The emergency room doctor diagnosed Donald  
Ashwell with early stage pneumonia and prescribed an antibiotic. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mississippi limits how many prescriptions it buys each month  
for Medicaid patients, and the drugstore said Ashwell had reached 
his limit. Unable to pay for the $45 antibiotic, Ashwell went home. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days later, Ashwell, 37, had worsened severely and was  
hospitalized -- but it was too late. He died. 
</P>
<P>
	And Medicaid had a $4,900 hospital bill.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a dilemma that thousands ... of people across the  
country face every month,'' said Cynthia Folcarelli of the National 
Mental Health Association, which is using Ashwell's death last 
month to ask the federal government to end state prescription 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey by the Health Care Financing Administration, which  
oversees Medicare and Medicaid, found that at least 11 states 
restrict the number of prescription drugs nonhospitalized Medicaid 
patients can receive per month. Limits vary from three in Arkansas 
to five in Mississippi and 10 in West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the same conundrum facing all health plans: Medications are  
the fastest-growing health care cost, so limiting them is logical 
when budgets are tight, said William Waldman of the American Public 
Human Services Association, which represents Medicaid directors. 
</P>
<P>
	There must be safeguards ensuring critical care isn't denied,  
Waldman cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics say even in states that provide waivers for  
emergencies -- as most do -- vulnerable patients must know how to 
work the byzantine system. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's mind boggling, all the red tape and things people have to  
go through,'' said Ashwell's sister, Patricia Vinciguerra. ``If you 
don't (know how), you are in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashwell took five drugs every day to control schizophrenia and  
manic depression. The medicines worked well enough that he became a 
frequent, and popular, volunteer at area health clinics, said Susan 
Richards of the Mental Health Association of Harrison County, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Wiggins, Miss., hospital death report says Ashwell  
couldn't buy a sixth drug, the antibiotic, ``because of financial 
problems.'' The records describe painful and expensive attempts to 
save Ashwell after his untreated pneumonia worsened. 
</P>
<P>
	Limiting prescriptions rarely is a problem, said Mississippi  
Medicaid director Helen Wetherbee. Of Mississippi's 500,000 
Medicaid recipients, ``we have about 2,500 who bump that limit once 
a year or more,'' she said. ``The limit is a very generous one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Mississippi passed a law in April allowing patients to  
appeal for an extra five drugs if a doctor determines exceeding the 
limit is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	There's the real mystery of Ashwell's death: Under the new law,  
Wetherbee says she would have authorized Ashwell's antibiotics if 
only someone had asked. Why didn't anyone? 
</P>
<P>
	``That's my question,'' said Wetherbee, who is contacting the  
hospital, drugstore and Medicaid case managers involved ``to make 
sure it doesn't happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Richards contends Medicaid is responsible: It didn't notify  
health officials, including pharmacists, about the new waiver until 
May 14, days after Ashwell died. 
</P>
<P>
	``Legislation is notice to all the world,'' responded Wetherbee.  
</P>
<P>
	Sally Richardson, who oversees state Medicaid operations for the  
Health Care Financing Administration, said in a statement that her 
office is looking into Ashwell's death, but that states can limit 
Medicaid as they see fit. 
</P>
<P>
	Folcarelli's group, which represents thousands of patients who  
rely on numerous drugs daily, has written every state that limits 
prescriptions urging that they lift the limits because of Ashwell's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Most states allow some waivers, if a doctor notifies Medicaid  
that someone needs an emergency prescription, or don't count 
certain drugs like insulin toward the limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Rarely are appeals denied, acknowledged Cynthia Wainscott of the  
mental health association in Georgia, where the limit is five 
drugs. But many patients may not know they can appeal, or the 
process can take too long, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states creatively bend prescription limits: In North  
Carolina, doctors can prescribe a 100-day supply so patients who 
need more than six drugs a month can stagger refills. Plus, a $6 
million fund allows mental health patients to get psychiatric drugs 
directly from state clinics, thus leaving Medicaid to cover other 
illnesses.

<HEADLINE> Merrill To Pay $15M in Copper Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. has agreed to pay a civil  
fine of $15 million to settle federal regulators' allegations of 
helping commodities firms illegally manipulate copper prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced the  
settlement Wednesday. Merrill Lynch said it also had agreed to pay 
about $10 million to settle related charges made by the London 
Metal Exchange in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	The CFTC charged in May that the big Wall Street firm worked  
with Global Minerals and Metals Corp. and Japan's Sumitomo Corp. to 
artificially force prices higher in late 1995, fueling a scandal in 
the world copper market. 
</P>
<P>
	In agreeing to the settlement, Merrill Lynch neither admitted to  
nor denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	David Spears, acting CFTC chairman, said the action  
``demonstrates that the CFTC stands ready to take stern action 
against those who would assist others in manipulating U.S. futures 
and commodity prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement applies to two divisions, Merrill Lynch  
International Inc. and Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner &AMP; Smith (Brokers 
&AMP; Dealers) Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The CFTC dropped its earlier charges against the parent company,  
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. Inc. The reason was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, the two divisions also agreed to refrain  
from such violations in the future and to cooperate with the CFTC 
in its ongoing investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's charges are still pending against New York-based  
Global Minerals, its president and chief executive officer, R. 
David Campbell, and its chief copper trader, Carl Alm. Global 
Minerals and Campbell have denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Merrill Lynch, which earlier had denied the  
agency's allegations, said Wednesday it agreed to the settlement 
``to bring closure to these regulatory proceedings and to avoid the 
expense and distraction of protracted litigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case stems from a scandal that rocked the world copper  
market in 1996, based on trades that occurred as much as 10 years 
beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	Yasuo Hamanaka, a former Sumitomo star trader who has been  
convicted of fraud and forgery by a Japanese court, caused $2.6 
billion in losses in unauthorized copper trading over a decade 
after cornering as much as 5 percent of the market. When the losses 
were exposed in 1996, copper prices plunged. 
</P>
<P>
	According to traders, Hamanaka's activities kept the price of  
copper high on the New York and London commodity futures markets in 
1995 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Former CFTC Chairwoman Brooksley Born has said the alleged  
manipulation caused serious harm to the U.S. copper market and 
American users of the metal by driving up prices. 
</P>
<P>
	About a year ago, Sumitomo agreed to pay $150 million to settle  
the CFTC's charges that it manipulated the world copper market. The 
big Japanese trading house, which also agreed to pay $8 million to 
British regulators, neither admitted to nor denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The CFTC alleged that Merrill Lynch ``knowingly and  
intentionally aided, abetted and assisted'' the manipulation scheme 
by providing substantial credit and financing that Global Minerals 
and Sumitomo used to corner warehouse stocks of copper. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators also accused Merrill Lynch of intentionally  
advising Global Minerals and Sumitomo on how they could best corner 
the market, saying that Merrill Lynch benefitted from the scheme in 
its own copper trading.

	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Northern Ireland's rival  
politicians failed Wednesday to meet a midnight deadline for saving 
the 1998 peace accord. British Prime Minister Tony Blair launched 
the negotiations in hopes of winning a long-overdue agreement to 
form a new Protestant-Catholic Northern Irish government. The 
negotiations went into the early hours Thursday at Stormont, center

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve today raised interest  
rates for the first time in two years. But the central bank 
indicated its tiny quarter-point increase may be all that is needed 
to keep inflation under control. That message cheered financial 
markets. The Dow Jones industrial average soared 155.45 points to 
10,970.80. The bond market, which has been battered for weeks by 
fears of inflation and higher interest rates, also staged a strong 
rally. The Nasdaq rose 44.30 to a new high of 2,686.41.

will say that excluding Social Security, budget surpluses over the 
next 10 years now appear to be about $170 billion higher than the 
non-partisan agency projected in January, congressional aides 
speaking on condition of anonymity told The Associated Press. On 
Monday, the White House calculated a $333 billion 10-year,

<HEADLINE> Digital Gauges Highlight New Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amtrak's new high-speed trains look nothing  
like the ironhorses of old. 
</P>
<P>
	Even at rest, the turquoise-and-silver, eight-car train sets  
look like some elongated bullet a giant Lone Ranger might have 
fired. Instead, ``Acela'' will streak between Boston, New York and 
Washington starting late this year at up to 150 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Up in the engineer's quarters, the greasy steam gauges have been  
replaced with Nintendo-style joysticks and computer-animated 
displays with a speedometer that goes up to 160 mph, 5 mph below 
the train's top speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in the passenger cars, there are electronic seat markers,  
power outlets at every seat and bright, roomy bathrooms that will 
allow diaper changes at faster than double the highway speed limit. 
The cafe cars will have beer on tap. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak gave reporters and a group of VIPs the first public  
viewing of the train Tuesday, in a railyard just two miles from the 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	A warm reception from gathered dignitaries, as well as the  
anticipation that the Northeast Corridor service will prompt calls 
for similar trains in the Southeast, Gulf Coast, Midwest and West, 
put Amtrak's chairman in the mood to boast. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're railroading, and we're going to be high-speeding all  
across America,'' said Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, the 
Republican who heads Amtrak's board of directors. ``When you look 
at this train, it says there's a new dawn a-comin'.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The train that was on display, numbered ``F 2001,'' is the  
second set completed by its manufacturer, the Bombardier-Alstom 
consortium. The first set is being tested in Pueblo, Colo., where 
it has hit 140 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The second train has been undergoing stationary testing in  
Philadelphia. Although its interior needs finishing, the train was 
brought down to Washington for the dedication of a new high-speed 
rail maintenance facility. The train will soon begin high-speed 
runs outside Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Acela train will begin passenger service in November  
or December. All 20 sets on order will enter service by late next 
summer. In the fall of 2000, Amtrak will reconfigure its entire 
Northeast Corridor schedule, allowing it to run its new trains at 
their intended speed. 
</P>
<P>
	That will reduce the trip between New York and Washington from  
three hours to 2 1/2 hours, and the longer run from New York to Boston 
from 4 1/2 hours to as little as three hours. At those trip times, 
Amtrak figures it can compete with airline shuttles when comparing 
the time it takes to get from the center of one city to another. 
</P>
<P>
	The fare is expected to run about $140 a trip, a little more  
expensive than the current service but about $60 less than the 
walkup fare for a similar shuttle flight. Businesses will also be 
offered group discounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new train service will establish a higher standard for  
intercity travel,'' said Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, 
who attended the unveiling with several legislative supporters, 
including Sens. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., 
and Rep. Bob Franks, R-N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's appearance in Washington was the latest in a series of  
events Amtrak is staging to build public interest in the new train 
service. In March, it unveiled the Acela name and distributed 
pictures and a computer animation of the new trains during a gala 
production in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Late this summer or in early fall it plans to show off the new  
train in action in Colorado. The date of the first passenger trip 
has yet to be set.

<HEADLINE> Web Consortium Approves XML Design </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- An Internet standards body has approved  
coding specifications that will allow the designing of Web pages 
using Extensible Markup Language, or XML. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Wide Web Consortium on Tuesday approved a standard for  
using ``style sheets'' in conjunction with XML, giving Web 
designers a wider range of design and display options when using 
XML. 
</P>
<P>
	Style sheets allow documents in an XML format to be easily  
converted into HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, which is the 
programming language used for displaying documents on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	XML documents can be coded to identify any portion of a  
document, such as a quote from a specific person. With this coding, 
search engines can give users more refined search, finding only 
those documents where the specified person is quoted. XML coding 
also could specify the zip code or codes that a document's contents 
refer to, allowing searches to find information about a specific 
zip code. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's Internet Explorer 5.0 browser already supports the  
new specifications, while future versions of Netscape are expected 
to. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Wide Web Consortium was founded in 1994 to develop  
common standards for Web design. The consortium is jointly hosted 
by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Institut National 
de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique based in France and 
Keio University in Japan.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Exercise Rice Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Glen Rice will be back with the Los  
Angeles Lakers next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers on Wednesday night exercised the $7 million option  
they hold on Rice, who had been the subject of trade rumors. The 
sharpshooting guard struggled in the Lakers' offense after arriving 
in a trade from Charlotte in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``We value Glen a lot,'' Lakers executive vice president Jerry  
West said. ``Our intent is to have him finish his career in Los 
Angeles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West bristled when asked if Rice would be traded later.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's very annoying to keep hearing innuendos of trades. It's  
not comfortable for us, it's not comfortable for the players,'' 
West said. ``It's something people simply make up a lot of times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers dipped down to the Division III ranks and made Devean  
George of Augsburg College in Minnesota their first-round pick in 
the NBA draft Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	George, the Division III player of the year, was the 23rd  
selection overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really not a secret,'' West said. ``You don't hear that  
much about him, but he really impressed everyone with his play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the second round, the Lakers took guard John Celestand of  
Villanova with the 30th pick overall. Los Angeles had just one 
selection in each round. 
</P>
<P>
	George, a 6-foot-6 1/2, 220-pound guard-forward, attracted the  
attention of NBA scouts at the Portsmouth Invitational, averaging 
13.7 points and 10 rebounds to earn all-tournament honors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know this isn't something a lot of people expected, but in  
my heart this is what I expected because of how much work I put 
into it,'' George said in a telephone call from his Minneapolis 
home. ``I was thinking first round all the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George made an impression on the Lakers during a workout.  
</P>
<P>
	``He can make shots,'' West said. ``A lot of teams liked him.''  
</P>
<P>
	George is Augsburg's No. 2 scorer with 2,258 points and No. 2  
rebounder with 1,211. He scored in double figures in 92 of 96 
career games, and five times had 40 or more points. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a versatile player. He'll give us some size and some more  
ballhandling,'' West said. 
</P>
<P>
	George played in a pro league with members of the Minnesota  
Timberwolves, including Kevin Garnett. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will not be intimidated by these players,'' West said.  
``He's very confident about his abilities.''

<HEADLINE> Committee OKs Holbrooke Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Richard Holbrooke's long-delayed nomination to  
be U.N. ambassador won the unanimous backing of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, but new obstacles emerged late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	More senators were planning delaying tactics, following the lead  
of Sen. Charles Grassley, who announced last week he would block 
the nomination over an unrelated civil service dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	While Grassley, R-Iowa, suggested in an interview the impasse  
could be resolved by week's end, later Wednesday other senators 
added their own ``holds'' to the nomination, said a spokesman for 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Grassley, these senators did so anonymously, which is  
allowed under Senate tradition, spokesman John Czwartacki said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he did not know who the senators were or whether their  
concerns were identical to Grassley's, but their objections to 
moving ahead this week with the nomination appeared 
``irreconcilable.'' Czwartacki did say the situation could change 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley is protesting a State Department decision to transfer a  
senior staff member from a U.N. office in New York to a lesser post 
in Washington after she informed members of Congress about alleged 
waste and mismanagement within the United Nations. He contends the 
transfer and demotion violated a law that he sponsored protecting 
whistle-blowers. 
</P>
<P>
	The new delays are the latest in a series of obstacles to  
Holbrooke's yearlong effort to win Senate confirmation. Now an 
investment banker, the veteran diplomat was the architect of the 
1995 Bosnia peace agreement and more recently served as the 
administration's envoy for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee vote was anticlimactic. Holbrooke's nomination was  
one of more than two dozen diplomatic nominations approved 
unanimously, by voice vote, without debate, and sent to the Senate 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, the chairman, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., joked with  
State Department official Barbara Larkin that the vote was one of 
the quickest ever for his panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke supporters hoped the Senate would approved the  
nomination before its July Fourth vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	But the hold by Grassley, who is not a committee member, remains  
in the way. By Senate tradition, any senator can block -- at least 
for a while -- any nomination for any reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley said the civil servant, Linda Shenwick, should be  
restored to her former job as a budget and administrative officer 
at the U.S. mission to the U.N. in New York. But he said he would 
settle for a ``mutually acceptable'' agreement between Ms. Shenwick 
and the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Secretary of State Madeleine Albright or any other State  
Department official has called him to try to work something out, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That raises the question: How badly does the secretary of  
state want this nomination to go through?'' Grassley asked. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James Foley refused to comment  
Wednesday on new developments. But earlier in the week, spokesman 
James Rubin said the matter was ``under investigation.'' He denied 
that Albright had waged a ``vendetta'' against Ms. Shenwick. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Shenwick contends she was singled out by Albright, who  
served as U.N. ambassador in New York from 1993 until becoming 
secretary of state in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is happening to me should not happen in the United States  
of America,'' Ms. Shenwick said on ABC's ``Nightline'' Tuesday 
night. ``It certainly should not happen in a government office to a 
government employee who is telling the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators generally predicted the dispute would be overcome, but  
were not sure how. ``Everything's resolvable around here,'' said 
Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a committee member. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced the nomination in June 1998, but it was  
delayed for nine months while the Justice and State departments 
investigated ethics allegations. The Foreign Relations Committee 
then conducted its own investigation and held hearings on 
Holbrooke. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations mainly concerned Holbrooke's private-sector  
contacts and speaking fees after leaving the State Department in 
1996. Without admitting wrongdoing, Holbrooke paid $5,000 to 
resolve most of the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also approved the nominations of John Holum as  
undersecretary of state for arms control and international security 
affairs, and Donald Pressley as assistant administrator of the 
Agency for International Development.

<HEADLINE> State Child Care Regulations Vary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	At Rhode Island daycare centers, caregivers can supervise no  
more than six toddlers, and state inspectors visit twice a year. In 
Idaho, child-care workers can oversee up to 18 toddlers, and 
centers are inspected every two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country, state regulation of child care varies  
widely, Working Mother magazine reported in its seventh annual 
survey, raising questions about safety and sanitation in some 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority of states don't require soft surfaces under center  
playground equipment. Three states -- Alabama, Connecticut and 
Montana -- don't require workers in accredited centers to wash their 
hands after diaper-changing, Working Mother reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states are funneling millions of dollars into child-care  
programs and have tight regulations concerning teacher-child 
ratios, inspections and training for staff members. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine didn't rank the states, but it singled out the 10  
best and 10 worst in terms of quality, availability and safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 best were: California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland,  
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The states with the poorest systems were Alaska, Arkansas,  
Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Tennessee, 
Utah and Wyoming, the magazine wrote in its July/August issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again the news from our report is a good news-bad news  
situation,'' said Nicola Godfrey, editor-in-chief of Working Mother 
magazine. ``Clearly there are some states that slumber when it 
comes to child care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While experts recommend ratios of up to six toddlers or up to  
four infants per caregiver, Idaho allows a caregiver to supervise 
up to 18 toddlers or up to six infants. 
</P>
<P>
	Most states average one caregiver for every four infants, and  
more than seven toddlers for every caregiver, according to The 
Children's Foundation, a Washington, D.C. advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
	In Idaho, some child-care center owners and advocates, aghast at  
the state's regulations, are working to change them. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way in that type of ratio that they can get the  
quality of care they need,'' said Laurie Roy, owner of the Prime 
Time Child Care Center in Meridian, Idaho, who is pushing for 
smaller ratios. ``Their minds need to be nurtured. That (state) 
ratio doesn't allow for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Idaho regulations also mandate four hours of training annually  
for daycare workers and inspections every two years. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne said the state is  
committed to helping provide good child care. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel very good about the efforts we're making in terms of  
early childhood development here in Idaho,'' said spokesman Brian 
Whitlock. ``The governor has declared this the ``generation of the 
child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island made it into the magazine's top 10 in part for  
passing legislation that doubled the state's child-care funding to 
$13 million. As part of the bill, the state will help fund health 
care coverage for daycare workers -- a rare state initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Most daycare workers earn near-poverty wages, leading to an  
average turnover rate of 30 percent at centers nationwide, 
according to a 1998 study by the Center for Child Care Workforce, 
an advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
	The lowest-paid assistants earn an average of $6 an hour, which  
compares with an average of $6.38 an hour for parking lot 
attendants, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois was cited by Working Mother for expanding its  
daycarelicensing staff 40 percent and allocating $26 million to 
programs that improve quality in child care programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The complete survey results can be seen at the magazine's Web  
site, www.workingmother.com.

<HEADLINE>  Dr. J Denies Fathering Tennis Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Even if her first Wimbledon is her  
last, Alexandra Stevenson certainly created quite a fuss. Her 
mother, too. 
</P>
<P>
	First there were questions about sex, race and money. Then, on  
the day she advanced to the quarterfinals, the issue of her 
parentage came up. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of Stevenson's birth certificate, printed by The Fort  
Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel on Wednesday, lists her father as Julius 
Winfield Erving II -- the same formal name of basketball great 
Julius ``Dr. J'' Erving. 
</P>
<P>
	The certificate gives the child's name as Alexandra Winfield  
Stevenson, born Dec. 15, 1980, and was filed Jan. 7, 1981, in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press also obtained a copy of the certificate.  
The father's state of birth (New York) matches that of the 
basketball star, although his age is listed as 31 and he was 
actually 30 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Contacted by the AP at his Orlando office shortly before the NBA  
draft on Wednesday night, Erving said: ``This is not the time to 
talk to anyone about personal business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erving, vice president of the Orlando Magic, promised to discuss  
the subject at another time. 
</P>
<P>
	He had told the paper that Stevenson was not his daughter.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have four children,'' he said, listing the names of three  
sons and a daughter. He and wife Turquoise have been married since 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson refused to comment when asked three times at  
Wednesday's post-match news conference about the identity of her 
father. Her mother, Samantha Stevenson, a free-lance journalist who 
covered the Philadelphia 76ers when Erving starred for the team, 
also wouldn't comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether she had a father figure in her life, Alexandra  
Stevenson said, ``My mother. She was both my mom and my father and 
she's a great single parent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the 18-year-old Stevenson refused to answer questions  
about her parentage, she did read a statement defending her 
mother's accusations over the weekend about racism and lesbianism 
on the WTA Tour. Samantha Stevenson is white; her daughter is 
black. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stevensons also had threatened legal action if Alexandra was  
denied Wimbledon prize money. She entered the tournament as an 
amateur but then turned pro. The dispute over her status was 
resolved and she will receive at least $80,448 for reaching the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's racism everywhere in the world and it's no different  
in the tour because the tour is part of the world,'' said Alexandra 
Stevenson, who said a racial slur was used against her in a junior 
tournament a year ago in England. 
</P>
<P>
	On the court, Stevenson rallied to beat fellow American Lisa  
Raymond 2-6, 7-6 (10-8), 6-1 to set up a historic quarterfinal with 
Australian 16-year-old Jelena Dokic -- Wimbledon's other 
high-profile prodigy. It's the first time two women qualifiers have 
reached the final eight in Wimbledon's 113 years. 
</P>
<P>
	After struggling in the first set, Stevenson eventually  
overpowered Raymond as the ball started to bounce into her hitting 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The key point came in the tiebreaker in the second set. Raymond,  
a small, scrambling player, led the tiebreaker 6-5 and was a point 
from taking the match when she moved to the net on a rally and 
seemed poised to close things out with a volley. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stevenson hit a forehand winner down the line, passing  
Raymond to even the tiebreak at 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
	She clenched her fist, slapped her thigh and smiled broadly at  
her mother at courtside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to say that's my trademark shot,'' she said. ``I  
love hitting that shot. Pete Sampras hits that shot very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said her mother: ``She showed great poise as a future champion.  
Under the pressure she's had, she played tennis like an athlete 
plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Dokic, Stevenson faces a baseliner who shocked top-ranked  
Martina Hingis in the first round and Mary Pierce in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belgrade-born Australian has controversy swirling around her  
father, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Damir Dokic has been well behaved at Wimbledon, but he was  
ejected from a tournament three weeks ago for shouting at match 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	He was later arrested outside the Birmingham, England, tennis  
club for blocking traffic and jumping on a car. He was released 
after police said he had ``sobered up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dokic has said she can win the tournament. Ditto for Stevenson.  
</P>
<P>
	``She's gone this far and she believes she can win it,'' said  
Stevenson's coach, Craig Kardon. ``She's like a sponge. She keeps 
impressing me every day.''

<HEADLINE> First Lady Plans Upstate N.Y. Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday she  
will create her Senate exploratory committee next week and then go 
on a ``listening tour'' across upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
	A statewide poll reported it is an area of New York where she  
needs help politically in the 2000 race to succeed retiring 
Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	Papers creating the committee probably will be filed Tuesday  
with the Federal Election Commission, the first lady said in a 
statement. The committee will allow her to raise and spend money 
for campaign-related purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers have said they do not expect Mrs. Clinton formally to  
announce her candidacy until September at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after the filing, Mrs. Clinton said she plans a four-day  
trip into traditionally Republican upstate New York as part of what 
she expects to be a summer-long series of tours of the state. The 
first stop is at Moynihan's Oneonta-area farm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm eagerly looking forward to listening to New Yorkers and  
hearing directly what's on their minds about the issues affecting 
their families,'' said Mrs. Clinton, who has never lived or worked 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	During Mrs. Clinton's last visit upstate, to Binghamton three  
weeks ago, demonstrators greeted her with ``Carpetbagger Go Home'' 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll from the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute reported  
Wednesday that on the strength of upstate support, the best known 
of Mrs. Clinton's potential Republican opponents, New York City 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, was in a statistical tie with the first 
lady. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey found 46 percent of registered voters questioned  
favored Mrs. Clinton while 44 percent opted for Giuliani; the 
margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Quinnipiac poll indicated that Giuliani was favored by 67  
percent of GOP voters for the party's nomination, with lesser-known 
GOP rival Rep. Rick Lazio, of Long Island, at 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A February poll from the Hamden, Conn.-based polling institute  
had 54 percent of the respondents supporting Mrs. Clinton, compared 
with 36 percent for Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinnipiac pollster Maurice Carroll noted that in February, Mrs.  
Clinton held a 12-point lead among upstate voters, and that current 
polling gives Giuliani a 13-point edge in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest telephone poll of 1,131 registered voters was  
conducted June 22-28. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton's political aides defended  
political work performed by Ann Lewis, the White House's 
communications director. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's political  
operation, said Lewis has worked on setting up the first lady's Web 
site ``on her own time, using her own resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,  
accused Mrs. Clinton of ``using people she's never paid to run a 
campaign in a state where she's never lived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Giuliani and Lazio are running about neck and neck in  
the dash for Republican Senate race cash, according to estimates 
from both camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani and Lazio operatives each claim they will have just  
under $3 million in the bank when the books close Wednesday on the 
latest campaign filing period. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio's total is padded by the $1.8 million he already had in  
his campaign coffers, mostly left over from his 1998 congressional 
re-election bid. Giuliani has raised most of his money since 
forming an exploratory committee in mid-April.

<HEADLINE> GM To Acquire Rights to Hummer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Take a hike Jeep. Move over Ford Excursion. The  
General's buying Hummer. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. said Wednesday it plans to acquire the  
rights to market and distribute the Hummer, the civilian version of 
the military's tank-like ``Humvee'' all-terrain vehicle. More 
significantly, GM hopes to expand the Hummer line into the growing, 
high-profit market for big sport utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Zarrella, president of GM's North American operations, said  
the Hummer brand has strong appeal among under-30 drivers, a 
segment the world's largest automaker has struggled to attract in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very distinctive from anything else we have and anything  
else in the automotive market,'' he said. ``It has a positioning 
that revolves around the ultimate go-anywhere, do-anything vehicle. 
It's actually very strong with younger consumers in the research we 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a memo of understanding with manufacturer AM General  
Corp., GM plans to gain worldwide rights to the Hummer brand name. 
AM General would continue to assemble Hummers in Mishawaka, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	GM plans to market and sell the vehicles through the 52 Hummer  
dealers in the United States and Canada and eventually through its 
own, much larger dealer network, though Zarrella said details 
remain to be worked out. He said the deal should close within two 
to three months. 
</P>
<P>
	If done right, expanding the Hummer brand could position GM to  
better challenge its Detroit competitors in the light truck market: 
Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG. Both companies have been a 
step ahead of GM in introducing new light truck models. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford plans to begin selling the largest SUV yet in the fall, the  
Excursion, just as GM introduces its redesigned but slightly 
smaller Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL twins. 
DaimlerChrysler's Jeep and Dodge divisions have been tough 
competitors as well, with such hit models as the Dodge Durango and 
Jeep Grand Cherokee. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Gary Lapidus of Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. said the  
Hummer could help GM but probably would not be enough to regain 
sales leadership in the light truck market from Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that one brand alone is going to help them  
regain dominance,'' Lapidus said. ``Though you might have argued 
the same thing with Chrysler when they bought Jeep. They've 
certainly done a good job with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hummer is truly a niche vehicle. Priced from about $68,000  
to $86,000, it appeals to a small group of well-heeled drivers who 
want a big, military-style vehicle with an intimidating stance. GM 
could use the brand's tough image to market a new line of SUVs and 
pickups. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hummer was originally designed for military use. It's known  
in the armed forces as the ``Humvee,'' the pronunciation soldiers 
use for the acronym HMMWV, which stands for High Mobility 
Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle. It's built to go just about anywhere 
-- over boulders, across streams, and through mud, snow and desert 
sands. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Humvee earned praise and publicity in the Persian Gulf  
War, AM General began marketing it to civilians in 1992. Its first 
customer was Arnold Schwarzenegger, who bought a custom-made 
conversion of the military model and the first two civilian 
production models off the assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
	Zarrella said any new Hummers would have to be consistent with  
the brand's image and not conflict with trucks GM already makes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now it's an interesting niche,'' Lapidus said. ``AM  
General could use GM's help in product development, manufacturing 
and distribution. They just need to get Arnold as their spokesman. 
I could just see the ads now: ``Hummah -- Ahh'm baaack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AM General sold just 1,059 Hummers retail in the fiscal year  
ended Oct. 31. Total Hummer and Humvee sales worldwide were just 
over 3,000, spokesman Craig Mac Nab said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed deal, privately held AM General will continue  
to market the military version and produce other light- and 
medium-duty trucks for military and government use. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Zarrella said GM does not plan to take an equity stake in  
AM General, the deal could help the smaller company, which has been 
struggling with declining military spending and $30 million in lost 
sales over the past three years. Last year it lost $8.3 million on 
sales of $392.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	AM General, which grew out of a military truck contract with the  
long-defunct Studebaker Corp., is owned by New York-based Renco 
Group Inc.

<P>
	GOSHEN, N.Y. (AP) -- An assistant district attorney has been  
charged with murder for allegedly running down a roller skater, 
then driving a half-mile with the body on the hood of his car. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Harnisch, 39, faces second-degree murder charges in  
Saturday's death of Edwin Quirk, 40, who was skating with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Harnisch drove his car onto a bike path in  
Chester, hit Quirk and injured his wife, then continued with Quirk 
on the hood. He allegedly stopped his car, stole a parked car and 
drove a short distance before he was stopped by police. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Saturday, Harnisch's family called police to say he was  
manic depressive and had not been taking his medication, the 
Middletown Times Herald Record reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Harnisch spent 10 years in the office of the Manhattan district  
attorney before he was hired in Orange County in 1997.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Teen Abortion Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House passed new restrictions on abortion  
Wednesday that would penalize anyone who helped a minor avoid 
parental involvement laws by going to another state to end her 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 270-159 tally fell short of the two-thirds majority, or  
286 votes, needed to overturn a threatened White House veto. The 
bill moves to the Senate, which killed similar legislation last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Those voting for the measure included 206 Republicans and 64  
Democrats; opposed were 14 Republicans, 144 Democrats and one 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters argued such a law would safeguard parental rights,  
protect the health and well-being of minors and uphold the more 
than 30 state laws that require the notification or consent of at 
least one parent for a minor's abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	During more than three hours of debate, proponents noted that  
many schools will not distribute aspirin or take students on field 
trips without a parent's approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``But for a dangerous and sometimes fatal procedure a child ...  
can be transported across state lines without a simple notification 
of their parent,'' said Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas. ``This 
practice has to stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., said minors also would be  
protected from the adults who get them pregnant and then spirit 
them away for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the bill, ``rapists, sex abusers and other violators can  
continue to exploit our nation's underage daughters, help them 
disobey state laws and continue to rape and abuse them,'' said 
Ros-Lehtinen, the sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill makes it a crime for anyone other than a parent,  
guardian or legal custodian to evade parental involvement laws by 
taking a minor to another state for an abortion. It would not apply 
if the abortion was needed to save the girl's life. 
</P>
<P>
	Violators face maximum penalties of a year in jail and $100,000  
in fines, and parents whose daughters had abortions could pursue a 
civil remedies. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents argued that the bill would do more harm than good by  
forcing girls without supportive parents to resolve the situation 
on their own. Grandmothers and other relatives who help them would 
be subject to federal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, critics said the bill was unconstitutional and they  
questioned the wisdom of punishing people who cross state lines to 
have an abortion, which is legal, while guns or lottery tickets are 
bought, with impunity, in other states. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why should we make an exception here?'' asked Rep. Tammy  
Baldwin, D-Wis. She said 86 percent of counties do not have 
facilities that perform abortions and that it is common for women 
to go to other states for the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, criticized House Republican  
leaders for not allowing lawmakers to offer amendments on the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats had sought amendments, also backed by the White House,  
to exempt close family members, counselors and medical providers 
from liability. 
</P>
<P>
	``Young women have the same right to choose, constitutionally,  
as others,'' Jackson Lee said. ``This (bill) is not going to 
diminish abortions. This is only going to take away the rights of 
young people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., said opponents were motivated  
by their dislike for parental involvement laws. Instead of 
circumventing state law, he said relatives who want to help should 
assist the minor in getting a judge's permission for an abortion -- 
an option that most of the state laws provide. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a bill which is aimed at the right of adults to  
travel,'' Canady said. ``This is a bill which is aimed at the 
protection of minors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1218.

<HEADLINE> Women Drawing Huge Crowds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For the folks who put together the Women's World Cup, financial  
success was achieved just halfway through the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	For the folks hoping to win the Women's World Cup, the serious  
stuff is only getting started. 
</P>
<P>
	As the quarterfinals begin tonight in San Jose, Calif., with  
China playing Russia and Norway taking on Sweden, ticket sales have 
gone far beyond initial projections. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team, which plays Thursday night against Germany in the  
opener of a doubleheader at Landover, Md. -- followed by 
Brazil-Nigeria -- has played to an average of more than 65,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The non-U.S. games have drawn an average attendance of more than  
21,000, better than 11 of the 30 major league baseball teams 
currently average. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 570,000 tickets have been sold for the tournament, and  
chief organizer Marla Messing boldly predicts the number will soar 
beyond 600,000 if the Americans continue advancing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always believed in the potential of this tournament to  
be very successful, a breakthrough event for women's sports,'' 
Messing said Tuesday. ``But we are frankly in awe of what has 
happened so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That includes some very solid television ratings. ESPN's  
audience for last Thursday's U.S.-Nigeria game drew a 1.85 rating, 
the second-highest soccer match on the network, behind the men's 
World Cup semifinal last year between Brazil and the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Sunday's U.S.-North Korea game on ESPN2 got a 1.96 rating,  
the highest for any soccer match on ESPN2 and the fifth 
most-watched event on the network. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's soccer has been a big hit at the souvenir stands, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's not a story we anticipated,'' Messing said. ``We are  
consistently selling out all merchandise at the stadiums. The 
demand for our products is outstripping your standard demand ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	The story everyone in the United States is anticipating is an  
American advance to the final. But now things get dicey -- there are 
no more soft teams in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Germany is a lot like us,'' U.S. midfielder Julie Foudy said.  
``They are very skillful, hard-working and disciplined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Germans are also not as healthy as the Americans. The  
Germans will be without captain Martina Voss, out with a torn leg 
muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	But even without Voss, Germany still has midfielder Bettina  
Wiegmann. She creates much of the offense and is complemented by 
finishers Inka Grings and Brigit Prinz up front. Prinz has been 
especially dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, so have most of the Americans, who had a 13-1 edge in  
scoring in the first round. Plus, coach Tony DiCicco was able to 
rest key players throughout the opening round. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Akers and Kate Sobrero, both starters, have not played  
since the first half of the second game, against Nigeria. They 
should be fresh. Mia Hamm, Tiffeny Milbrett and Cindy Parlow up 
front and Foudy in midfield also got breathers in the opening 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	The subs, meanwhile, were superb, particularly Tisha Venturini  
(two goals) and Shannon MacMillan (one goal, two assists) against 
North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are playing pretty well,'' DiCicco said. ``But  
there still were a couple of breakdowns we need to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to keep getting better and evolving our game so the  
team you saw on June 19 hopefully will be much better on July 10. 
And we're working to be there on July 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would be in the final at the Rose Bowl.

</P>
<P>
	STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) -- Samdach Vira Bhante, a Cambodian monk  
who attained the highest spiritual status in Buddhism and advised 
leaders of Cambodia and India, died Saturday. He was 110. 
</P>
<P>
	Bhante served as a spiritual adviser to Cambodia's King Norodom  
Sihanouk and kept watch at the deathbed of India's first prime 
minister, Jawaharalal Nehru. 
</P>
<P>
	Sihanouk sent Bhante to see how schools were run in the United  
States and invited him often to meditations and conferences around 
the world. But the monk kept a simple lifestyle, giving up his 
possessions, cigarettes and alcohol and eating mostly fruits and 
vegetables, never past noon. 
</P>
<P>
	Bhante came to the United States for a quiet life of meditation  
with his relatives, most of whom arrived here as refugees from the 
war in Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
	He was called on to conduct the spiritual cleansing at a  
Stockton, Calif., school after a 1989 massacre left five children 
dead. He also was asked to build a temple for the city's growing 
Cambodian community -- estimated at more than 16,000.

</P>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Allan Carr, the writer-producer who  
brought the teeny-bopping play ``Grease'' to the big screen and won 
a 1984 Tony award for producing the Broadway hit ``La Cage aux 
Folles,'' died Tuesday. He was 62. 
</P>
<P>
	``Grease'' earned Carr several awards, including producer of the  
year from the national Association of Theatre Owners and two 
People's Choice awards for best movie and most popular film. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, he co-produced his first film, the coming-of-age comedy  
``The First Time,'' starring Jacqueline Bisset. 
</P>
<P>
	The next year, he co-produced the comedy ``C.C. and Company,''  
starring former quarterback Joe Namath as a motorcyclist who 
battles a biker gang that menaces a fashion journalist played by 
Ann-Margret. 
</P>
<P>
	After the success of ``Grease,'' Carr co-produced the 1980  
musical ``Can't Stop the Music,'' which starred the disco band The 
Village People. Carr returned to Rydell High in 1982 with the 
critically panned ``Grease 2,'' starring Michelle Pfieffer. 
</P>
<P>
	He continued producing stage shows while making movies, and in  
1984 won a Tony Award for producing that year's best musical, ``La 
Cage aux Folles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That same year, the producer made his last two films, the spy  
comedy ``Cloak and Dagger'' and sex farce ``Where the Boys Are 
'84.''

</P>
<P>
	YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) -- Catholicos Garegin I, the leader of the  
Armenian Apostolic Church, died Tuesday of larynx cancer. He was 
66. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this summer, the Armenian church canceled a trip by Pope  
John Paul II to Armenia because of the Catholicos' failing health. 
The Vatican had scheduled a July papal visit to Armenia as part of 
John Paul's efforts to improve relations with other Christian 
denominations. 
</P>
<P>
	Garegin studied at a seminary in Beirut, Lebanon, where he later  
became director. He became a deacon in 1949 and took a vow of 
celibacy in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	He studied in the theology department at Oxford University in  
1957-58, and in the 1970s he led church dioceses in the United 
States, Iran and India. 
</P>
<P>
	He took the name Garegin after an earlier Armenian spiritual  
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Garegin was elected Catholicos in April 1995, succeeding Vazgen  
I, who had held the post for 40 years.

	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- Eudora Garrison, food editor for The Charlotte  
Observer in the 1950s and 1960s, died Sunday. She was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrison was asked to head the food section in 1953. She stayed  
in the job until 1966, then wrote a regular column until 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Famous for her recipes for pound cake, fruit cake, fudge,  
biscuits, orange marmalade and maple-walnut bars, Garrison 
published several small cookbooks before a larger volume, ``It's 
Not Gourmet -- It's Better,'' came out in 1978.

	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Michael Hooker, a chancellor at the  
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and hailed as a 
visionary who wanted to use technology to change education, died 
Tuesday of cancer. He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	Hooker rose through the ranks of academia, from a teaching post  
at Harvard to the presidency of Vermont's Bennington College at age 
37. After three years at the helm of the University of 
Massachusetts, he returned to Chapel Hill as the eighth chancellor 
of the nation's oldest public university. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert on medical ethics, Hooker wrote scholarly articles on  
applied ethics in business and the ethics of biological warfare. He 
chaired a biotechnology advisory panel for the congressional Office 
of Technology Assessment from 1982 to 1984. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	Lee co-starred in 13 of the 21 RKO films popularized by the

in her lifetime, the last of those being ``Repent at Leisure'' in 
1941. Two years prior, she appeared with Ball in ``Twelve Crowded 
Hours.''

with expanding the San Diego Daily Transcript into a venerable 
business and financial newspaper, died Saturday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	The former banker bought the Daily Transcript in 1972 and worked  
to shape the paper into a local version of the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lister sold the Transcript in 1986 but was publisher for seven  
more years. 
</P>
<P>
	He ventured into publishing after retiring at 55 from his first  
career in banking. He had founded Lister Investment Co. and went on

whose gold and silver medals in the 1936 Games in Berlin upset 
Adolf Hitler, died June 16. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	His sister, Dever Antes, said Wayne spoke with Hitler after he  
won the springboard diving silver medal and the gold in platform 
diving. She said Hitler was upset that a German had not won. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne returned from the Berlin Olympics to his family home in  
Miami but returned to Europe as a colonel in the Army Air Force in 
World War II.

                            *John Woolf    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British film producer Sir John Woolf, who brought  
``The African Queen'' and ``Oliver!'' to the silver screen, died 
Monday. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, C.M. Woolf, had helped to rebuild Britain's film  
industry after World War I, setting up General Film Distributions 
in the late 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	After distinguishing himself in World War II, where Woolf worked  
on Army films and received the U.S. Bronze Star, he returned home 
to work for his father's company, which was the distribution arm of 
The Rank Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	After his father's death in 1942, Woolf became a managing  
director. In 1948 he founded his own company, Romulus Films, with 
his brother James. 
</P>
<P>
	As a producer, Woolf had a sharp eye for spotting hits. He put  
up half the money for ``The African Queen,'' which starred Humphrey 
Bogart and Katherine Hepburn and was a huge success. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Woolf's leadership, the company produced a string of hits,  
including ``Richard III'' starring Laurence Olivier, John Huston's 
``Moulin Rouge'' and ``Beat the Devil,'' the adaptation of John 
Braine's novel ``Room at the Top'' and Academy Award-winner 
``Oliver!'' in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Woolf's films won 13 Oscars.  
</P>
<P>
	He founded Anglia Television in 1958 and set up a drama  
department that produced more than 100 plays and series such as 
``Orson Welles' Great Mysteries'' and ``Tales of the Unexpected'' 
for broadcast around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolf was knighted in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Hawaiians Hope the Dance Goes On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- It's as Hawaiian as sitting on a beach at sunset  
and sipping a tropical drink with a tiny parasol in it. As 
mandatory as trying poi at a luau or taking a photo with Diamond 
Head in the background. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kodak Hula Show, held Tuesday through Thursday mornings at  
the Waikiki Shell in Kapiolani Park, has drawn tourists since it 
debuted in 1937 with ukulele players and dancers in grass skirts. 
</P>
<P>
	The free show was the brainchild of a former Eastman Kodak Co.  
executive, who saw it as a sure-fire way to sell film. Until then, 
tourists had little opportunity to snap pictures of hula dancers in 
daylight. 
</P>
<P>
	The gambit worked wonders until Kodak announced in May that it  
was ending its longest-running sponsorship in hopes of attracting 
younger photographers. There was a sigh of relief Tuesday among 
tourists and organizers when Kodak extended its sponsorship for 30 
days until a co-sponsor can be found to help pay the show's 
$550,000 annual cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Part cultural, part commercial, the year-round show has come to  
symbolize Hawaii to the more than 17 million visitors who have seen 
it over the past 62 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We come every time we are here,'' said Debbie Corona of Los  
Angeles, who first saw the show as a 10-year-old in 1968. ``It's 
fun. We get out there and hula and my dad takes videos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tourism is the Aloha State's No. 1 industry, generating $11  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The show features a cast of 40 from the Royal Hawaiian Girls  
Glee Club, including hula dancers dressed in traditional skirts 
made of green ti leaves and coconut bras, fragrant flower leis in 
their hair. 
</P>
<P>
	While it has evolved over the years, the house orchestra remains  
endearing: 14 musicians in long muumuus and sun hats perform 
throughout the hour-long photo opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	During the show, hula dancers spell out ``Hawaii'' in big red  
and yellow letters, what the show's host calls the quintessential 
``Kodak moment.'' And tourists snap away every time. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the music is what we used when we started, the dances  
too,'' said Lily Wai, who was in the first Kodak show. ``It's great 
to keep up the old traditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Word that the show could be saved was welcome news to May Akeo  
Brown, who has been part of the dance for 61 years, and now serves 
as the show's manager and narrator. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got goose bumps,'' said Brown, whose aunt, Louise Akeo  
Silva, created the show along with Kodak executive Fritz Herman. 
``That's great news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herman saw the show as a way to sell more film to tourists since  
most hula shows in Hawaii are held at night, in darker hotel 
showrooms and arenas. If tourists run out of film, there's plenty 
for sale nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	But this spring, Kodak spokesman Jim Blamphin said the company  
was looking to attract younger people into photography, and the 
hula show mostly attracts older visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a shame to lose the show,'' said Brown, whose  
daughter, Betsy, is a dancer. ``I've made a lot of friends over the 
years, people from all around the world. A lot of people come back 
to visit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	News of its impending demise prompted a community effort to save  
the show. Nearby businesses worried that tourists would instead 
spend money at the Bishop Museum, the Waikiki Aquarium or the 
Honolulu Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something different, something fun,'' said Delphine  
Rickard, who also started with the show in 1938 as a dancer, and 
now plays ukulele while her niece, Lehua Young, dances. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great family tradition,'' Young said.

<HEADLINE> McCain Pushes Campaign Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEDFORD, N.H. (AP) -- Criticizing colleagues in both parties,  
presidential candidate John McCain pledged today to ``call for the 
reform of our political system everywhere I go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona senator, seeking the Republican presidential  
nomination, delivered an address at Bedford Town Hall on 
overhauling the campaign finance laws, promising to make the issue 
a major plank in his platform. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, on NBC's ``Today'' show, he said the current way of  
financing political campaigns alienates young voters, helping to 
depress turnout on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are corrupted by it,'' McCain said. ``It's the future of  
America that's at stake here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I will call for the reform of our political system everywhere  
I go in this campaign,'' McCain said. ``I will ask my supporters to 
make campaign finance reform their top priority, and I'll challenge 
my opponents to declare their independence from the political 
welfare system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His call for overhauling the system echoes that of another  
presidential candidate, former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N,J., who 
talked about campaign finance during his visit to New Hampshire 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, the lead sponsor of campaign finance legislation in the  
Senate, singled out President Clinton for hosting big Democratic 
contributors in the Lincoln Bedroom and Vice President Al Gore for 
attending a fund-raiser in a Buddhist temple. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most Americans care very much when monks and nuns abandon  
their vows of poverty and pay tens of thousands of dollars to have 
spiritual communion with the vice president,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also found fault with fund-raising practices in his own  
party, asserting that contributors were able to obtain projects in 
congressional spending bills. Corporations give tens of thousands 
of dollars in unregulated ``soft money'' contributions that are not 
covered by federal restrictions. McCain's bill would ban soft 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine the promises we could keep and the good we could do if  
politicians stopped treating the federal treasury as a duty-free 
shop for soft-money donors,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, he said, ``For the sake of soft money, we have put tax  
loopholes for special interests ahead of tax relief for working 
families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech today, McCain promised to try to get a Senate vote  
within the next few weeks on his bill to ban soft money. The 
measure was defeated last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to fight as hard as we can,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Accused L.A. Madam Pleads Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A woman charged with running one of the  
area's largest illegal escort services has pleaded innocent to 
providing call girls to high-class clients and celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
	Jody Diane Gibson, also known as ``Babydol'' and ``Sasha,'' was  
charged Tuesday with nine counts of pandering, pimping and 
conspiracy. She was arrested June 9 after a 10-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gibson and her attorney, Jerry Scotti, declined comment  
Tuesday. She could be sentenced to six years in prison on each 
count. 
</P>
<P>
	Police described Ms. Gibson, 41, as a one-time rival of  
``Hollywood Madam'' Heidi Fleiss who kept detailed notes on her 
customers and marketed her ``California Dreamin''' business on the 
Internet. Clients, accepted by referral, would pay between $500 to 
$3,000 for the services. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 30-employee operation serviced more than 100 men, Lt. Mike  
Felix said. Although names contained in Ms. Gibson's ``black book'' 
were not released, Felix has said she may have inherited some of 
Ms. Fleiss' clients. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Writer-Producer of 'Grease' Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Allan Carr, the film and stage  
producer who brought ``Grease'' to the big screen and whose ``La 
Cage aux Folles'' won him a Tony Award, has died after battle with 
cancer. He was 62. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr died in his Beverly Hills home Tuesday afternoon, said Cece  
Karz, a spokeswoman for Paramount Studios. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a number of health problems in the past year, including a  
kidney transplant and hip surgery in December, Karz said. Doctors 
discovered he had cancer in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr was known for adding a touch of camp to everything he  
touched, from ``Grease'' to the often-lampooned 1989 Academy Awards 
telecast. 
</P>
<P>
	``Grease,'' the 1978 teen dance extravaganza starring John  
Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, earned him several awards, 
including People's Choice awards for best movie and most popular 
film. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, he co-produced his first film, the coming-of-age comedy  
``The First Time,'' starring Jacqueline Bisset. 
</P>
<P>
	The next year, he co-produced the comedy ``C.C. and Company,''  
starring former quarterback Joe Namath as a motorcyclist who 
battles a biker gang that menaces a fashion journalist played by 
Ann-Margret. 
</P>
<P>
	After the success of ``Grease,'' Carr co-produced the 1980  
musical ``Can't Stop the Music.'' He returned to Rydell High in 
1982 with the critically panned ``Grease 2.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He continued producing stage shows while making movies, and in  
1984 won a Tony for producing that year's best musical, ``La Cage 
aux Folles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He later produced the 1989 Oscars show, criticized by some as  
tacky and tedious. It included a 20-minute opening dance number 
with a squeaky-voiced Snow White-lookalike singing ``Proud Mary'' 
with actor Rob Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to shock people with glamour and humor,'' Carr said  
while preparing that telecast. ``Whether people like me or don't 
like me, or they like what I do or don't like what I do, they know 
that I love Hollywood and I'm a big enthusiast for Hollywood.''

<HEADLINE>  Dr. J Denies Fathering Tennis Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Even if her first Wimbledon is her  
last, Alexandra Stevenson certainly created quite a fuss. Her 
mother, too. 
</P>
<P>
	First there were questions about sex, race and money. Then, on  
the day she advanced to the quarterfinals, the issue of her 
parentage came up. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of Stevenson's birth certificate, printed by The Fort  
Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel on Wednesday, lists her father as Julius 
Winfield Erving II -- the same formal name of basketball great 
Julius ``Dr. J'' Erving. 
</P>
<P>
	The certificate gives the child's name as Alexandra Winfield  
Stevenson, born Dec. 15, 1980, and was filed Jan. 7, 1981, in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press also obtained a copy of the certificate.  
The father's state of birth (New York) matches that of the 
basketball star, although his age is listed as 31 and he was 
actually 30 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Contacted by the AP at his Orlando office shortly before the NBA  
draft on Wednesday night, Erving said: ``This is not the time to 
talk to anyone about personal business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erving, vice president of the Orlando Magic, promised to discuss  
the subject at another time. 
</P>
<P>
	He had told the paper that Stevenson was not his daughter.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have four children,'' he said, listing the names of three  
sons and a daughter. He and wife Turquoise have been married since 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson refused to comment when asked three times at  
Wednesday's post-match news conference about the identity of her 
father. Her mother, Samantha Stevenson, a free-lance journalist who 
covered the Philadelphia 76ers when Erving starred for the team, 
also wouldn't comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether she had a father figure in her life, Alexandra  
Stevenson said, ``My mother. She was both my mom and my father and 
she's a great single parent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the 18-year-old Stevenson refused to answer questions  
about her parentage, she did read a statement defending her 
mother's accusations over the weekend about racism and lesbianism 
on the WTA Tour. Samantha Stevenson is white; her daughter is 
black. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stevensons also had threatened legal action if Alexandra was  
denied Wimbledon prize money. She entered the tournament as an 
amateur but then turned pro. The dispute over her status was 
resolved and she will receive at least $80,448 for reaching the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's racism everywhere in the world and it's no different  
in the tour because the tour is part of the world,'' said Alexandra 
Stevenson, who said a racial slur was used against her in a junior 
tournament a year ago in England. 
</P>
<P>
	On the court, Stevenson rallied to beat fellow American Lisa  
Raymond 2-6, 7-6 (10-8), 6-1 to set up a historic quarterfinal with 
Australian 16-year-old Jelena Dokic -- Wimbledon's other 
high-profile prodigy. It's the first time two women qualifiers have 
reached the final eight in Wimbledon's 113 years. 
</P>
<P>
	After struggling in the first set, Stevenson eventually  
overpowered Raymond as the ball started to bounce into her hitting 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The key point came in the tiebreaker in the second set. Raymond,  
a small, scrambling player, led the tiebreaker 6-5 and was a point 
from taking the match when she moved to the net on a rally and 
seemed poised to close things out with a volley. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stevenson hit a forehand winner down the line, passing  
Raymond to even the tiebreak at 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
	She clenched her fist, slapped her thigh and smiled broadly at  
her mother at courtside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to say that's my trademark shot,'' she said. ``I  
love hitting that shot. Pete Sampras hits that shot very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said her mother: ``She showed great poise as a future champion.  
Under the pressure she's had, she played tennis like an athlete 
plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Dokic, Stevenson faces a baseliner who shocked top-ranked  
Martina Hingis in the first round and Mary Pierce in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belgrade-born Australian has controversy swirling around her  
father, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Damir Dokic has been well behaved at Wimbledon, but he was  
ejected from a tournament three weeks ago for shouting at match 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	He was later arrested outside the Birmingham, England, tennis  
club for blocking traffic and jumping on a car. He was released 
after police said he had ``sobered up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dokic has said she can win the tournament. Ditto for Stevenson.  
</P>
<P>
	``She's gone this far and she believes she can win it,'' said  
Stevenson's coach, Craig Kardon. ``She's like a sponge. She keeps 
impressing me every day.''

<HEADLINE> Global One Chief Executive Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The president and chief executive  
officer of Global One, a telecommunications consortium of Sprint 
Corp., France Telecom and Germany's Deutsche Telekom AG, has 
resigned in the wake of published reports that the venture was 
failing and could be dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies announced Wednesday that Gary Forsee would resign  
from the international venture effective July 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Forsee, who was named to the position in February 1998, cited  
personal reasons and the desire to pursue other career options for 
his decision to leave the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint spokesman Bill White said that Forsee's resignation was  
not an indicator that the consortium was falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``The partners are continuing discussions with Global One,'' he  
said. ``We have discussions regarding the structure of Global One 
going forward, to make sure there is alignment among the 
partners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Global One was formed in 1996 to offer large multinational  
corporations complete, integrated telecommunications services 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, The New York Times reported that an agreement to  
dissolve the consortium could be imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives close to Global One told the newspaper that Sprint  
chairman William T. Esrey sent a letter to executives at Deutsche 
Telekom and France Telecom that said the venture was failing, and 
decisive moves should be made to end the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	At Sprint's annual meeting in Kansas City, Mo., in April, Esrey  
confirmed that Sprint had proposed to its European partners that 
the relationship be re-examined. 
</P>
<P>
	Without offering specifics, he told shareholders that ``we have  
taken decisive steps to bring Global One's performance up to our 
expectations. Global One is winning significant contracts with 
multinational customers, and revenues are expected to grow at 
double-digit rates in 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White said Wednesday that little had changed and that the  
discussions to improve Global One's performance were still ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``All three companies are committed to serving multinational  
customers, and right now that is under Global One,'' White said. 
</P>
<P>
	White said there was no timeline to replace Forsee.

<HEADLINE> Senate Rejects Easing Cuba Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate approved a $12.7 billion foreign  
aid package late Wednesday after rejecting, on a 55-43 vote, an 
effort to sharply ease restrictions on Americans who want to travel 
to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors said 38 years of sanctions have failed to produce much  
impact on the policies of Cuba's Fidel Castro -- and it was time to 
try something new. Opponents argued it would undermine U.S. policy 
toward the communist government. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would send a signal to Fidel Castro that we're prepared to  
do something without anything in response,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, 
D-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., the chief sponsor of the  
rejected proposal, asked: ``What's the purpose of a further 
isolation (of Cuba) if in 40 years it hasn't produced a change?'' 
</P>
<P>
	After rejecting the proposal by Dodd, the Senate approved, 97-2,  
the overall foreign aid package. The House has yet to take up 
similar legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would provide $535 million to the Serbian province  
of Kosovo and various Balkan and Eastern European states next year. 
The White House is threatening a veto of the overall bill, mainly 
on grounds that it cuts too much from what it views as critical 
programs, including the Peace Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide $1.9 billion less than President Clinton  
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Another section opposed by the administration would add $20  
million for a security force in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	A White House statement on Wednesday said this provision ``could  
be interpreted as aimed at training and equipping the Kosovo 
Liberation Army'' and that this was ``diametrically at odds'' with 
the recent agreement by the KLA to disarm under NATO supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of the Senate  
Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee, told the Senate 
that ``members of the KLA may very well be included in a security 
force, but that is not a decision for us to make.'' He said the 
measure does not provide express support for arming or supporting 
the KLA. 
</P>
<P>
	On the effort to ease travel restrictions on Cuba, the proposal  
by Dodd would have allowed all U.S. citizens the same liberalized 
travel rights to go to Cuba that journalists and government 
officials now enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, there are no regular flights from U.S. airports to  
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Direct charter flights to Cuba were legal until 1996 when the  
four Miami-based planes were shot down. Clinton retaliated by 
banning such flights but reinstated them in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the government imposes sharp restrictions on who can  
travel, mostly limiting travel rights to those who have families in 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., opposed the move to relax these  
restrictions. Even under the current setup, some 100,000 Americans 
a year have been visiting Cuba, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our argument with Fidel Castro is not over,'' Torricelli said.  
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the easing complained that Americans are free to  
travel to many other countries that have authoritarian governments, 
including China. 
</P>
<P>
	But any move to lift restrictions on Cuba always brings  
vociferous objections, particularly from those with a large number 
of Cuban-American constituents. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the time for lifting any of the sanctions on  
Cuba,'' said Florida's Graham. ``This is the time for us to hold 
the line on our policy.''

<HEADLINE> House Passes Teen Abortion Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House passed new restrictions on abortion  
Wednesday that would penalize anyone who helped a minor avoid 
parental involvement laws by going to another state to end her 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 270-159 tally fell short of the two-thirds majority, or  
286 votes, needed to overturn a threatened White House veto. The 
bill moves to the Senate, which killed similar legislation last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Those voting for the measure included 206 Republicans and 64  
Democrats; opposed were 14 Republicans, 144 Democrats and one 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters argued such a law would safeguard parental rights,  
protect the health and well-being of minors and uphold the more 
than 30 state laws that require the notification or consent of at 
least one parent for a minor's abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	During more than three hours of debate, proponents noted that  
many schools will not distribute aspirin or take students on field 
trips without a parent's approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``But for a dangerous and sometimes fatal procedure a child ...  
can be transported across state lines without a simple notification 
of their parent,'' said Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas. ``This 
practice has to stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., said minors also would be  
protected from the adults who get them pregnant and then spirit 
them away for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the bill, ``rapists, sex abusers and other violators can  
continue to exploit our nation's underage daughters, help them 
disobey state laws and continue to rape and abuse them,'' said 
Ros-Lehtinen, the sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill makes it a crime for anyone other than a parent,  
guardian or legal custodian to evade parental involvement laws by 
taking a minor to another state for an abortion. It would not apply 
if the abortion was needed to save the girl's life. 
</P>
<P>
	Violators face maximum penalties of a year in jail and $100,000  
in fines, and parents whose daughters had abortions could pursue a 
civil remedies. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents argued that the bill would do more harm than good by  
forcing girls without supportive parents to resolve the situation 
on their own. Grandmothers and other relatives who help them would 
be subject to federal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, critics said the bill was unconstitutional and they  
questioned the wisdom of punishing people who cross state lines to 
have an abortion, which is legal, while guns or lottery tickets are 
bought, with impunity, in other states. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why should we make an exception here?'' asked Rep. Tammy  
Baldwin, D-Wis. She said 86 percent of counties do not have 
facilities that perform abortions and that it is common for women 
to go to other states for the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, criticized House Republican  
leaders for not allowing lawmakers to offer amendments on the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats had sought amendments, also backed by the White House,  
to exempt close family members, counselors and medical providers 
from liability. 
</P>
<P>
	``Young women have the same right to choose, constitutionally,  
as others,'' Jackson Lee said. ``This (bill) is not going to 
diminish abortions. This is only going to take away the rights of 
young people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., said opponents were motivated  
by their dislike for parental involvement laws. Instead of 
circumventing state law, he said relatives who want to help should 
assist the minor in getting a judge's permission for an abortion -- 
an option that most of the state laws provide. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a bill which is aimed at the right of adults to  
travel,'' Canady said. ``This is a bill which is aimed at the 
protection of minors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1218.

<HEADLINE> NHL Drops Puck on Free-Agent Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Another NHL season opens Thursday. No, not the race for the  
Stanley Cup, the race for free-agent dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Such players as Colorado's Theo Fleury and Valeri Kamensky and  
Pat Verbeek of the champion Dallas Stars will be able to sign with 
any team with the passing of the midnight deadline Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	They are part of this summer's unrestricted free-agent crop,  
meaning they can sign with any team in the NHL without compensation 
to the former team. A player whose contract has expired becomes an 
unrestricted free agent at the age of 32, as long he has four years 
of NHL experience. 
</P>
<P>
	The restricted free agents are something else. To sign such a  
player, the penalty is steep: up to five first-round draft choices, 
depending on the amount of salary offered the player. In this case, 
the former team has the right to match the offer sheet presented to 
the player. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those in this elite ``Group II'' crop are Detroit  
defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom and forward Miroslav Satan of Stanley 
Cup finalist Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim's Paul Kariya and Philadelphia's Eric Lindros were taken  
out of the mix when they re-signed with their respective teams just 
before the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	It should otherwise be open season for NHL teams looking for  
that key player and missing ingredient. Such as Brett Hull, who 
joined the Stars after coming over from St. Louis last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Except there are no Hulls available this time. Or even a Ron  
Francis or Curtis Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
	Those three signed with new teams last summer in a big year for  
big-name free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury, who was traded from Calgary to Colorado just before the  
trading deadline in March, is the biggest name in a less glamorous 
crop this time. Fleury scored 93 points in the 1998-99 season from 
40 goals and 53 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury figures to be one of the big winners this summer,  
expected to get a hefty raise from the reported $2.4 million salary 
he earned this past season. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Rangers may be interested, among other teams. Wayne  
Gretzky, who retired at the end of the season after playing three 
years in New York, said he had recently done some lobbying with 
Fleury for his former team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's up to the Rangers,'' Gretzky added.  
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers have already kept two of their top players out of  
the free-agent market by re-signing defenseman Brian Leetch and 
forward Adam Graves. Mark Recchi was another big-name player who 
re-signed with his team, the Philadelphia Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the other unrestricted free agents available: defensemen  
Ulf Samuelsson and Mark Tinordi of Atlanta, and Steve Duchesne of 
Philadelphia; forwards Joe Murphy of San Jose, New Jersey's Dave 
Andreychuk, Joe Juneau of Buffalo, and Craig Janney of the New York 
Islanders; and goaltenders Kirk McLean of Florida, Ken Wregget of 
Calgary, and Washington's Rick Tabaracci.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Prices Rocket Higher / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices soared on Wednesday in a powerful  
rally triggered by investor relief over the Federal Reserve's 
suggestion it won't raise interest rates for a second time this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 9/32  
points, or $12.81 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, fell to 5.96 percent from 6.06 percent 
late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Fed raised rates slightly on Wednesday to check  
nascent inflationary pressures, the move was widely expected in the 
financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed policy-makers said they were increasing the target for the  
federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other on 
overnight loans, from 4.75 percent to 5 percent. That move was 
followed quickly by announcements from commercial banks they were 
increasing their prime lending rate, the benchmark for millions of 
business and consumer loans, from 7.75 percent to 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the same time the Central Bank indicated the increase may  
be all that is needed to keep inflation under control, sending 
bonds higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates on new Treasury securities such as bonds tend to  
depress the value of existing fixed-rate investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the Treasury market, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities rose 5/16 point to 13/32 point, while prices of 
intermediate maturities rose between 11/16 point and 1 1/32 points, 
reported Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 4.75 percent, while  
the discount fell 0.07 percentage point to 4.63 percent. Six-month 
yields fell to 5.02 percent as the discount fell 0.08 percentage 
point to 4.83 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	One-year yields fell to 5.05 percent, while the discount fell  
0.10 percentage point to 4.80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.25 percent from 4.88 percent on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 11/32 to 118 15/16, with the yield 
falling to 5.53 percent from 5.55 percent.

players acquired by the Detroit Red Wings at the March 23 trading 
deadline still with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendel Clark, who came to the Red Wings from the Tampa Bay  
Lightning for goaltender Kevin Hodson and a second-round draft 
pick, was officially informed Tuesday that the team will not 
exercise a $2-million option on his contract for the upcoming 
season, The Detroit News reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark scored 32 goals last season, including four for the Red  
Wings in 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
	A little more than three months after Detroit acquired Chelios,  
Clark, defenseman Ulf Samuelsson and goaltender Bill Ranford, only 
Chelios remains. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Samuelsson was dealt to the expansion Atlanta  
Thrashers for future considerations and Ranford was waived last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings traded for the four playoff-tested veterans just  
before the trading deadline as the team prepared for a run at a 
third consecutive Stanley Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit was beaten in six games by the Colorado Avalanche in the  
Western Conference semifinals.

<HEADLINE> Starbucks Expects Lower Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Starbucks Corp. warned Wednesday that annual  
profits would be lower than expected due to shortfalls in its 
non-core businesses and the cost of launching a new Internet 
portal. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had estimated the gourmet coffee retailer would earn 60  
cents per share for fiscal 1999. But Starbucks late Wednesday 
predicted earnings of 54 cents per share, with earnings over the 
next two quarters coming up 3 cents short of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was made after the markets closed. Starbucks'  
shares fell $10, or nearly 27 percent, in after-hours trading on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market, after closing the regular session at 
$37.56 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Calabrese, editor and analyst at Argus Research predicted  
the stock would rebound gradually Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certain it won't hold there in the morning,'' Calabrese  
said. But he cautioned, ``I don't think it's going to climb up to 
where it closed today for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a strong core retail business, some of Starbucks' other  
businesses haven't grown as expected, CEO Howard Schultz said in a 
conference call. He named the company's specialty food business and 
its North American partnership with Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz also cited $4 million in unbudgeted costs for developing  
the company's Internet strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Company executives had expected that strong retail sales in  
Starbucks core coffee business would make up the difference, but 
that didn't happen, Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We raised our expectations too high,'' he said. While the  
company's North American retail profit margin is up 1 percent in 
fiscal 1999 compared with fiscal 1998, Schultz said profits fell 
below internal estimates. In retail sales alone, Schultz said, 
revenue was expected to be $16 million less than initial internal 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Schultz said, ``We remain as optimistic as ever  
for the potential for significant profit growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet will play a role in that growth.  
</P>
<P>
	To direct the launch of the new Internet portal, Starbucks will  
form a new subsidiary named Starbucks X, led by senior vice 
president Debbi Gillotti, Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said the company plans to create a ``canopy brand'' Web  
site that will include sales of gourmet food, kitchen products and 
home furnishings as well as coffee products and music. He also said 
the company will announce a major strategic partnership for the 
Internet site later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	By expanding Starbucks' online sales beyond coffee, Schultz said  
the company is taking a crack at potential revenues estimated at 
$100 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Starbucks, more than 75 percent of the company's  
customers use the Internet, and they have an average income of more 
than $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a category in which we can win,'' Schultz said.

<HEADLINE> Ausmus Suspension Cut to 1 Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Brad Ausmus' suspension for ``aggressive  
arguing'' with an umpire was reduced from two games to one by 
American League president Gene Budig, and the Detroit catcher sat 
out Wednesday's game against the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Budig left in place the $500 fine against Ausmus. He eliminated  
the $500 fine against Detroit manager Larry Parrish but left intact 
his two-game suspension. Parrish will miss games at Minnesota on 
Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Budig, who heard the appeals Tuesday, imposed the original  
penalties June 7, saying Ausmus and Parrish were too aggressive 
when they argued with umpire Chuck Meriwether on May 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair also bumped the umpire during an argument following the  
ejection of the Tigers' Matt Anderson, who hit Mike Stanley with a 
pitch in the seventh inning of an 8-7 loss at Boston. Anderson was 
fined but not suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigers coach Lance Parrish, who is not related to the manager,  
probably will act as manager Friday and Saturday.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Rights Chief Visits Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- With ethnic Albanian refugees  
flooding home to Kosovo and tens of thousands of Serbs fleeing 
revenge attacks, the United Nations' top human rights official flew 
into the province today to check on efforts to protect both groups. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Mary Robinson's first trip into Kosovo since NATO  
peacekeepers began deploying in the province June 12 as Serbian 
troops withdrew under a peace accord that ended the 78-day allied 
air war. 
</P>
<P>
	International investigators, meanwhile, are uncovering  
widespread efforts to destroy evidence of atrocities in Kosovo, a 
Yugoslav war crimes tribunal spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are very clear signs that mass grave sites have been  
tampered with,'' spokesman Paul Risley told reporters at The Hague. 
``There are eyewitness accounts that the bodies of victims have 
been removed from sites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As well as attempts to destroy or tamper with forensic evidence  
such as mass graves, investigators in the last two weeks have found 
evidence of intentional torching of documents that could point to a 
systematic campaign of war crimes by Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``In virtually every police station and administrative office  
that we ... were able to secure, there was evidence of huge fires, 
piles of ashes as high as a person's chest,'' Risley said. ``It is 
clear there was a very extensive process of burning of these kinds 
of documents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tribunal already has charged Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic and four senior aides with orchestrating atrocities by 
Serb forces in Kosovo. None of the indicted men are in custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson expressed concerns about ``the safe return of the  
Kosovo refugees, and also the protection of the Serb population,'' 
she told AP Television News as she arrived by helicopter outside 
Pristina, Kosovo's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian forces began cracking down on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo  
early last year, and accelerated their efforts during NATO's 
bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately it has been Serbs suffering at the hands of some of the  
477,000 ethnic Albanians who have flooded back so far. Many have 
found their homes or farms burned and relatives dead or missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite NATO's pledges to protect Serbs in Kosovo, more than  
71,000 have fled, Ron Redmond of the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees said today. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 50,000 went to Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's two  
remaining republics. The rest went to the smaller republic, 
Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbs have felt especially threatened in western Kosovo, scene  
of some of the worst atrocities against ethnic Albanians during the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond said Serbs and Gypsies in Orahovac, 30 miles southwest  
of Pristina, are ``feeling increasingly insecure and are seeking 
assistance in evacuation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More evidence of atrocities against ethnic Albanians surfaced.  
Maj. Jan Joosten of the peacekeeping mission said today that 11 
burned bodies were found in a house in Kalilane, north of Pec in 
northwestern Kosovo. He said they all appeared from a single ethnic 
Albanian family. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pristina, the scene of considerable looting and other  
lawlessness in the past two weeks, peacekeepers said life was 
returning to some semblance of normalcy. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are returning to work, and commercial activity is  
beginning to blossom,'' Joosten said. 
</P>
<P>
	British forces also reached an accord with the management of  
Pristina's Grand Hotel, which houses many of the foreign 
journalists and aid workers in Pristina, to hire as many as 140 
ethnic Albanians while keeping on staff the 70 Serbs working there. 
</P>
<P>
	Unhappiness over exclusive Serb control of the hotel since 1991  
boiled over Sunday when Albanian-born Americans occupied the hotel 
bar and began serving drinks. The occupation ended with an 
agreement to enter negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	In Serbia, there were signs of growing dissent against  
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10,000 protesters demanded his ouster during an opposition  
rally Tuesday in Cacak, the only town in Serbia fully controlled by 
the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, 50 opposition Democratic Party members demanded that the  
Serb government release two Kosovo Serb refugee leaders detained 
June 22 in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, during a protest against 
treatment of Serbs who have fled Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The opposition in Serbia remains relatively weak and divided,  
and the extent of popular dissatisfaction with Milosevic remains 
unclear. Opponents have been bolstered by the influential Serbian 
Orthodox Church, which also has urged Milosevic to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo is a small republic in southern Serbia. Though many Serbs  
regard it as the medieval cradle of their religion and nationality, 
its prewar population of about 2.1 million was 90 percent ethnic 
Albanian. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 860,000 ethnic Albanians fled Kosovo and Serb forces during  
the NATO air war that began March 24.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Pitches Medicare Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- While the GOP gingerly picked through his  
Medicare plan, President Clinton pitched his ideas Wednesday like 
an easygoing salesman and teased the rival party: ``No one escapes 
time and age. Republicans age just like Democrats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president, opening a campaign for his proposed Medicare  
overhaul, addressed some 350 senior citizens inside the ornate 
Chicago Cultural Center. But his message also was aimed at 
Republicans laboring on Capitol Hill to find fault with his ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Loosen up, relax,'' Clinton said before taking the afternoon  
off at a Chicago Cubs game. 
</P>
<P>
	As some elderly women in the audience penciled notes on the back  
of their speech invitations, the president made a salesman's pitch, 
reeling off costs, copayments and growth projections of the 
Medicare proposal he unveiled on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the money to do this. This is simply a matter of  
choice,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he was guest of honor at a $500,000 Democratic party  
fund-raiser before returning to Washington. Democrats, he said, 
have a ``solemn responsibility'' to get things done with 
congressional Republicans. ``We shouldn't be caught playing 
politics waiting for the next election,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has proposed new, universal coverage for prescription  
drugs -- at a 10-year cost of $118 billion to the government -- and 
the elimination of patient copayments for preventive services, in 
addition to incentives for Medicare patients to choose more 
cost-effective HMO's. 
</P>
<P>
	Frances Seidman, a retired Illinois state worker eager to shake  
Clinton's hand, said it was about time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medication is a huge expense and it always seemed strange to  
me it wasn't included,'' Mrs. Seidman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he can pay for the entire package and buttress  
Medicare against the coming wave of Baby Boom retirements by 
designating, over the next 15 years, $794 billion in expected 
federal budget surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 28-minute speech Wednesday, he thrice shadowboxed with  
Republicans who favor using surplus funds for tax cuts and who have 
their own ideas for securing Medicare's financial solvency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, I know there are a thousand good uses for this surplus,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Again, I say ...  
</P>
<P>
	``And I say again, there are many good uses for the surplus. I  
have my ideas, the Congress has their ideas. But first things 
first,'' he said. ``We have to take care of this problem and do it 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House invited Hanna Bratman, a 79-year-old Chicago  
widow to speak about how hard it can be to afford necessary 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
	With apologies for being nervous, Mrs. Bratman told the audience  
that she spends $2,800 a year -- about 10 percent of her income -- on 
inhalers for her asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have three of the dumb things, they make sure I can  
breathe,'' she said. ``It's hard to describe the fear of not 
knowing whether you'll be able to afford the next medication the 
doctor prescribes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a Republican lawmaker stung in the 1996 elections  
by Democratic charges the GOP wanted to gut Medicare, delicately 
criticized Clinton's plan as too generous to senior citizens who do 
not need help. 
</P>
<P>
	California Rep. Bill Thomas, chairman of the Ways and Means  
health subcommittee, circulated a ``Dear Colleague'' letter that 
offered several ``observations'' about the president's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proposal gives a drug benefit to everyone, regardless of  
whether they need it or not -- even retired millionaires. Two-thirds 
of seniors already have coverage. Why replace these private dollars 
with taxpayer dollars?'' Thomas wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, offered its troops  
``talking points,'' counseling them to ``be cautious about any 
changes that could lead to higher premiums for seniors or restrict 
seniors' choice of drugs, doctors or hospitals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their party, which controls Congress, was working on its own  
Medicare reforms ``that put seniors and their doctors in control of 
their health care decisions, not Washington bureaucrats and 
politicians,'' the RNC said.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton's Search Fuels Rumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTH SALEM, N.Y. (AP) -- The possible sighting of what might  
have been Secret Service agents on a rural road in Westchester 
added fuel to rumors that Hillary Rodham Clinton has chosen a new 
home. Not that the fuel had been running out. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the speculation has been going something like this:  
</P>
<P>
	--Mrs. Clinton plans to buy a house in Westchester. No, wait,  
she's buying a co-op in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	--She's looking in North Salem. No, wait, North Salem's too  
fancy. 
</P>
<P>
	--She's considering the stone lodge that belongs to the man who  
made David's Cookies. No, wait, she rejected it because it was 
``too rustic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Well, then, she's spending $3.8 million for an 18-room mansion.  
The Secret Service was there, so Mrs. Clinton must have been there 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	--Wait! Can she afford it?  
</P>
<P>
	--Wait! New Rochelle's invited her!  
</P>
<P>
	--Wait! What does Mrs. Clinton say?  
</P>
<P>
	Well, Mrs. Clinton's not saying much. Marsha Berry, her  
spokeswoman, said Wednesday that Mrs. Clinton has made no decision 
on a house and has no favorite she's aware of. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's not dampening the speculation about her future home --  
or keeping people from objecting in advance to her possible arrival 
in North Salem. On Wednesday, not far from Town Hall, the words 
``Rudy yes, Hillary no'' were hand-lettered on a manila envelope, 
accompanied by three deflated balloons and attached to a stop sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Town Supervisor Sy Globerman, a Republican, said a few residents  
called him Wednesday asking if anything could be done to keep Mrs. 
Clinton out. ``They're worried about an intrusion on the 
peacefulness of the town,'' he said. ``Traffic, the media, the 
Secret Service. But the borders are open. If you have the money you 
can have the land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State law says that if Mrs. Clinton runs for the Senate, she has  
to have a New York residence by Election Day 2000 -- 16 months from 
now. On Monday, Ms. Berry said, Mrs. Clinton and her daughter 
Chelsea looked at houses ``in the city and the environs.'' She 
wouldn't say which houses and wouldn't even confirm Mrs. Clinton 
was in Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
	So much for the facts. Here's the latest dish:  
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the same day she was house-hunting, some people in  
North Salem thought they saw what looked like Secret Service agents 
on both ends of Mill's Road, a two-lane byway that is the address 
of a vacant home on a 17-acre lot listed at $3.8 million. 
Wednesday's New York Post reported that agents visited the house, 
though their ``mission'' was unclear. Some people thought Mrs. 
Clinton was there. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was there, she wasn't there,'' real estate agent Sally  
Siano said Wednesday. ``Nobody really knows. It's just brokers 
talking to other brokers, asking each other what they've heard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The house is owned by James Kohlberg, managing partner of a  
brokerage in Mount Kisco and son of Jerome Kohlberg, one of the 
founders of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co., a Wall Street firm. 
Through a spokeswoman, he declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The house, called ``Mill's Ridge,'' has 18 rooms, including five  
bedrooms, plus a barn, a pool and a caretaker's cottage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has fabulous views of the Titicus Reservoir,'' Ms. Siano  
said. ``It's up on a hill and sort of hangs over the water. And 
it's at the end of a long, long driveway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The driveway may help meet one of the Clintons' reported  
priorities -- privacy. ``It's heavily wooded and no one would ever 
know who was coming and going,'' said Ms. Siano, of Sally Siano &AMP; 
Associates in Bedford. 
</P>
<P>
	The other priority is said to be golf, and Westchester likes to  
think of itself as the American cradle of the game. Country clubs 
pretty much surround North Salem. 
</P>
<P>
	So it might be a good fit. But can the Clintons, who have legal  
debts and less-than-fabulous salaries, afford $3.8 million? 
Besides, who buys the first house they see? 
</P>
<P>
	Other reports have the Clintons looking elsewhere in  
Westchester, including in Harrison and Croton-on-Hudson. The 
Democratic mayor of New Rochelle has invited them to his 
middle-class city. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's still Manhattan to consider.  
</P>
<P>
	Wendy Sarasohn, senior vice president of the Corcoran Group,  
said she thinks representatives of the Clintons -- hiding their 
purpose -- have been looking at townhouses. And she won't take 
second place to Westchester on the privacy issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the city, we become more respectful because we're  
accustomed to walking down the street and passing celebrities all 
day long,'' she said. ``Katharine Hepburn lived in a house on 49th 
Street for years and was a recluse. A Westchester house with guards 
would have more people gawking. In Manhattan, people get over it.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Dole Makes Candidacy Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former American Red Cross president Elizabeth  
Dole dropped all pretense about her political intentions today. 
She's running for the presidency in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time Republican Cabinet member formed an ``exploratory  
committee'' in the spring to raise and spend money while she 
determined the feasibility of a campaign for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer said today that Mrs. Dole is no  
longer simply exploring. ``She's running,'' he said. A formal 
announcement is expected in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole has made her intentions clear for months, but the  
spokesman said she decided to drop the exploratory language on the 
same day that second-quarter presidential fund-raising ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer said Mrs. Dole will report raising $3.4 million,  
including $2.7 million in the last three months. That 
second-quarter figure is second only to Texas Gov. George W. Bush, 
Fleischer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has the most momentum than any candidate other than  
Governor Bush,'' the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Bush is on pace to raise at least $20 million more than  
Dole. And at least one other GOP foe, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, 
has raised more money than Dole overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer noted that McCain and fellow candidate Rep. John  
Kasich of Ohio are allowed by law to transfer money from their 
congressional campaign accounts, calling that a ``cozy little 
loophole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it is impressive that Mrs. Dole raised more in the  
second quarter than the lawmakers, both chairmen of powerful 
committees `who can raise oodles of money from lobbyists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most polls show Mrs. Dole a distant second to GOP front-runner  
Bush. Recent gains in the polls by the Texas governor have come at 
Mrs. Dole's expense.

<HEADLINE> No Progress at E. Timor Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- East Timor's rival factions failed to  
make substantive progress in five days of peace talks, agreeing 
today only to abide by a previous agreement and leaving some key 
issues unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
	The tense negotiations were aimed at paving the way for a smooth  
vote in late August, when East Timorese will choose whether to 
become independent or gain autonomy within Indonesia, which invaded 
the former Portuguese colony in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	The pro- and anti-independence forces, however, couldn't even  
reach accord on how to continue negotiations, rejecting a proposal 
by the host Roman Catholic Church to set up a joint committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite a good atmosphere around the negotiating table, deep  
divisions remain,'' church spokesman Domingos Sequiera said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources at the talks said the biggest -- and perhaps  
irreconcilable -- difference involves guarantees the losing side 
will have of safety after the referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	A proposal to free rebel independence leader Jose Alexandre  
``Xanana'' Gusmao, who is serving a 20-year sentence under house 
arrest in Jakarta, also was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The rival factions did agree to abide by a June 18 agreement to  
surrender their weapons and to honor the outcome of the referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	But previous promises to disarm have quickly been broken, and  
deadly violence has continued. Dozens have been killed in the last 
two months alone, and thousands have fled their homes for the 
jungle. 
</P>
<P>
	The referendum, originally scheduled for Aug. 8, was postponed  
earlier this month by at least two weeks because of security and 
logistical concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-independence militias have been accused of waging a terror  
campaign to derail the referendum and reportedly tried to steer the 
discussions away from the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	They insisted that Indonesia had conceded enough by allowing the  
referendum to take place and said pro-independence leaders should 
be more flexible. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks concluded a day after a U.N. electoral office in East  
Timor was attacked, injuring several workers and sharply 
underscoring the deep divisions there. 
</P>
<P>
	Condemnation of the attack was quick and widespread.  
</P>
<P>
	U.N. special envoy Jamsheed Marker told reporters today in  
Jakarta that the organization would not be ``chased away'' by ``the 
hoods and hoodlums who carried out this despicable attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian army commander Gen. Wiranto today began an  
investigation into the attack, which he said had resulted from a 
clash between pro- and anti-independence groups. Wiranto, like many 
Indonesians, uses only one name. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-independence leaders expressed outrage at the attack.  
</P>
<P>
	``It happened while we were talking about reconciliation and  
peace here,'' said Manuel Viegas Carrascalao, a pro-independence 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-independence militia leaders at the conference, who have  
claimed the United Nations has sided against them, appeared 
unconcerned. 
</P>
<P>
	If the U.N. office or U.N. personnel have been attacked, ``it's  
because of dissatisfaction among the people,'' said militia leader 
Eurrico Gutterres.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Pitches Medicare Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- While the GOP gingerly picked through his  
Medicare plan, President Clinton pitched his ideas Wednesday like 
an easygoing salesman and teased the rival party: ``No one escapes 
time and age. Republicans age just like Democrats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president, opening a campaign for his proposed Medicare  
overhaul, addressed some 350 senior citizens inside the ornate 
Chicago Cultural Center. But his message also was aimed at 
Republicans laboring on Capitol Hill to find fault with his ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Loosen up, relax,'' Clinton said before taking the afternoon  
off at a Chicago Cubs game. 
</P>
<P>
	As some elderly women in the audience penciled notes on the back  
of their speech invitations, the president made a salesman's pitch, 
reeling off costs, copayments and growth projections of the 
Medicare proposal he unveiled on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the money to do this. This is simply a matter of  
choice,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he was guest of honor at a $500,000 Democratic party  
fund-raiser before returning to Washington. Democrats, he said, 
have a ``solemn responsibility'' to get things done with 
congressional Republicans. ``We shouldn't be caught playing 
politics waiting for the next election,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has proposed new, universal coverage for prescription  
drugs -- at a 10-year cost of $118 billion to the government -- and 
the elimination of patient copayments for preventive services, in 
addition to incentives for Medicare patients to choose more 
cost-effective HMO's. 
</P>
<P>
	Frances Seidman, a retired Illinois state worker eager to shake  
Clinton's hand, said it was about time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medication is a huge expense and it always seemed strange to  
me it wasn't included,'' Mrs. Seidman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he can pay for the entire package and buttress  
Medicare against the coming wave of Baby Boom retirements by 
designating, over the next 15 years, $794 billion in expected 
federal budget surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 28-minute speech Wednesday, he thrice shadowboxed with  
Republicans who favor using surplus funds for tax cuts and who have 
their own ideas for securing Medicare's financial solvency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, I know there are a thousand good uses for this surplus,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Again, I say ...  
</P>
<P>
	``And I say again, there are many good uses for the surplus. I  
have my ideas, the Congress has their ideas. But first things 
first,'' he said. ``We have to take care of this problem and do it 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House invited Hanna Bratman, a 79-year-old Chicago  
widow to speak about how hard it can be to afford necessary 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
	With apologies for being nervous, Mrs. Bratman told the audience  
that she spends $2,800 a year -- about 10 percent of her income -- on 
inhalers for her asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have three of the dumb things, they make sure I can  
breathe,'' she said. ``It's hard to describe the fear of not 
knowing whether you'll be able to afford the next medication the 
doctor prescribes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a Republican lawmaker stung in the 1996 elections  
by Democratic charges the GOP wanted to gut Medicare, delicately 
criticized Clinton's plan as too generous to senior citizens who do 
not need help. 
</P>
<P>
	California Rep. Bill Thomas, chairman of the Ways and Means  
health subcommittee, circulated a ``Dear Colleague'' letter that 
offered several ``observations'' about the president's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proposal gives a drug benefit to everyone, regardless of  
whether they need it or not -- even retired millionaires. Two-thirds 
of seniors already have coverage. Why replace these private dollars 
with taxpayer dollars?'' Thomas wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, offered its troops  
``talking points,'' counseling them to ``be cautious about any 
changes that could lead to higher premiums for seniors or restrict 
seniors' choice of drugs, doctors or hospitals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their party, which controls Congress, was working on its own  
Medicare reforms ``that put seniors and their doctors in control of 
their health care decisions, not Washington bureaucrats and 
politicians,'' the RNC said.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Litigation Bill Faces Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House lawmakers, shrugging off last-minute  
White House concerns, agreed Wednesday to bring a bill limiting 
Y2K-related lawsuits to the House floor Thursday for certain 
passage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate could also approve the legislation Thursday, sending  
it to President Clinton for his signature or veto. 
</P>
<P>
	After several days of tough negotiations with the White House,  
House and Senate lawmakers announced Tuesday that they had a deal. 
White House Chief of Staff John Podesta, in a letter, said he was 
prepared to recommend that Clinton sign the bill with inclusion of 
several changes designed to increase consumer protections. 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said  
Wednesday that several glitches had come up that required further 
attention, and congressional sources said the White House was still 
unhappy over some of the bill's legal language. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, who played a role in crafting the final  
product, said in an interview that he understood there were some 
last-minute problems in putting the deal in writing. But he said 
there was a ``90 percent chance'' they would be worked out and the 
bill signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore conceded he was in a political box trying to assuage the  
conflicting interests of trial layers and the computer industry -- 
two important Democratic constituencies. But, he said the pressure 
was ``no more than is frequently the case when you have differing 
legitimate points of view that have to be reconciled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are working through some of the details of the compromise  
that John Podesta outlined in his letter yesterday, and are hopeful 
that at the end of the day we will have legislation that the 
president can sign into law,'' said White House spokesman Jake 
Siewert. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican lawmakers said they were not going back to the  
negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regardless of the administration position today or yesterday,  
we'll move forward and I am confident the president will sign this 
good bipartisan Y2K liability reform legislation at the end of the 
day,'' said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreier's Rules Committee, which sets the agenda for floor votes,  
approved the compromise bill without dissent Wednesday, setting the 
stage for final passage Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, sought by the high-tech community but opposed by many  
consumer groups, would try to head off a flood of lawsuits from 
millennium bug computer failures by giving companies 90 days to fix 
Y2K-related problems before lawsuits can be filed and by 
encouraging mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	It also sets punitive damage caps for small businesses, makes it  
harder to file class action lawsuits and states that, in most 
cases, a defendant can be held liable only for the proportion of 
damage he causes. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri said he still  
opposed the bill, saying Republicans were using it to win financial 
support from the high-tech industry and that it ``harms what is a 
very, very good civil justice system in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, ranking Democrat on the  
Judiciary Committee, said he was pleased with the compromise: ``We 
have now fully crafted a bill that we can all live with and 
enjoy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., a chief sponsor of the bill, said support  
of Democrats such as Conyers, who opposed the original House-passed 
bill, ensured its success because even if the president vetoed it, 
the House could override the veto.

<HEADLINE> Vt. Prison Escapee Captured in Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- A game of pool with undercover officers  
led to the capture of a prison escapee. 
</P>
<P>
	James Lertola was captured by five U.S. marshals in a bar in  
Daytona Beach, Fla., Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal William Gerke Jr. 
said yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lertola, 23, was one of two inmates who escaped last month from  
Vermont's Northern State Correctional Facility in Newport. He was 
serving a five- to 33-year sentence for previous escapes and 
kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	After talking to the driver of a car stolen in Vermont that was  
found in Florida, marshals started watching the bar for Lertola and 
the other escapee, Craig Whitman. Plainclothes marshals saw Lertola 
on Saturday but weren't sure of his identity, so they engaged him 
in a game of pool. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had been very cautious and reserved,'' Gerke said.  
</P>
<P>
	During their conversation, Lertola asked the deputies where they  
were from. ``They said, 'Where are you from?' He said, 'I'm from 
Vermont.' After that question was asked and answered, the melee 
ensued,'' Gerke said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He put up a huge fight,'' Gerke said. ``You can characterize  
it as an extremely violent struggle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman was still at large.

<HEADLINE> Tragedy at the Track; Life Goes On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The winning filly in the Mother Goose Stakes was Dreams Galore.  
</P>
<P>
	Dreams galore are what trainer Eddie Plesa Jr. had for Three  
Ring -- a storybook script in which the filly would win the Kentucky 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 19th-place finish in the Derby was a disappointment, but the  
Mother Goose was a tragedy. Three Ring never even got to the post 
for the race last Saturday at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	In the paddock, Three Ring fell, hit her head and had to be  
euthanized. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impact fractured her skull,'' attending veterinarian Dr.  
Anthony Verderosa said. ``It was not something she could survive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A thoroughbred horse can be poetry in motion, at times the most  
exciting performer on the sports scene. But these powerful animals 
also are crystal fragile. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoist the Flag, touted as a Triple Crown winner in 1971, broke a  
leg during a gallop at Belmont Park in April and was retired. 
Charismatic broke a cannon bone and sesamoid during the Belmont 
Stakes on June 5 in his bid to become the first winner to sweep the 
Derby, Preakness and Belmont since Affirmed in 1978. There were, of 
course, the fatal breakdowns of the fillies Ruffian and Go for 
Wand. 
</P>
<P>
	Broken bones, which lead to retirement or death, are part of  
racing. You might say they're the nature of the beast. 
</P>
<P>
	What happened to the multiple stakes-winning Three Ring, whose  
principal owner was Barry Schwartz, was a freak accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Plesa has been quoted as saying the filly was playing a little  
while blinkers were being put on her. When she took a step 
backward, she lost her balance on a slight incline that sloped to a 
storm drain next to her stall and hit her head hard. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Ring then reportedly struggled to get up, lost her balance  
and hit her head on a stanchion. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Gary Lavan, a longtime vet, said Thursday from his Longfield  
Farm at Goshen, Ky., he remembered something similar happening ``to 
a good colt named Gentleman Jim or Gentleman James in Florida about 
40 years ago,'' who was trained by Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons. 
</P>
<P>
	``There also was a very good filly at Churchill Downs 10 years  
or so ago,'' Lavan said. ``She was coming out of the barn and going 
over a little drainage ditch when in a split second something 
spooked her and she went over and hit her head on the concrete 
culvert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A tragedy or a career-ending injury to a horse running for their  
pleasure, or profit, can make people shudder or repulse them. 
</P>
<P>
	People in racing shudder, too, but the game is their livelihood,  
especially trainers and jockeys, and hope for the Big Horse is 
their holy grail. So they go on. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know what tragedy is lurking outside the barn,''  
Lavan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Accidents happen on farms as well as at race tracks.  
</P>
<P>
	``Horses can be out in the field at night when a storm or some  
freakish thing happens and they can run into each other or into 
trees,'' Lavan said. 
</P>
<P>
	After comforting his stable help following Charismatic's  
breakdown in the Belmont, trainer D. Wayne Lukas faced the media 
the next morning and talked about three beautiful workouts he had 
just witnessed. They were by 2-year-olds. After all, there's 
another Triple Crown next spring.

<HEADLINE> Cartoonist Hits Nerve With Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Md. (AP) -- Racist. Mean-spirited. Degrading.  
</P>
<P>
	After two months of national syndication, ``The Boondocks,'' a  
wickedly satirical comic strip by a young black artist about black 
children living in white suburbia, has been called all that and 
more. It has also developed a fierce and loyal following. 
</P>
<P>
	Whites and blacks alike have complained that the cartoon  
promotes violence and perpetuates racial stereotypes. Others have 
contacted their newspapers to say thanks for giving them a voice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am offended and appalled by The Sun's printing that horrible  
cartoon, `The Boondocks.' In this day, when there is so much hatred 
between the races and violence among our youth, do we need more of 
the same in the comics?'' Cynthia Matthews of Columbia wrote in a 
letter to the Baltimore newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Not since ``Doonesbury'' in 1970 has a comic had such a  
successful -- or controversial -- debut, said John McMeel, president 
of Universal Press Syndicate, which distributes both comics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Boondocks'' was created by Aaron McGruder, a 25-year-old  
who works from a bedroom in his parents' home in Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	It debuted April 19 and appears in more than 180 newspapers,  
including The Washington Post, The Dallas Morning News, the Los 
Angeles Times and the San Francisco Chronicle. Only one small 
paper, The Aiken (S.C.) Standard, has dropped the strip. 
</P>
<P>
	Readers of the 15,000-circulation paper ``were offended by it,  
but they also didn't think it was funny,'' said Scott Hunter, 
editor and publisher. ``I agreed with them. It seemed to be based 
all on race, but it wasn't funny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strip mirrors the life of McGruder, who was born in Chicago  
and moved to the suburbs in Illinois, Kentucky and finally 
Maryland, where he was often the only black child in class. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get any big thrill out of making people mad, despite  
what people might think,'' McGruder said. ``I just want to make 
people laugh and think, and do my thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strip's main character, Huey Freeman, is an angry but  
respectful boy with a militant outlook. His Afro about a foot high, 
Huey carries a perpetual scowl and tries to convert his exhausted 
grandfather and others to his sensibility, dropping references to 
the Black Panthers and fearing that a neighbor watering a lawn is 
about to hose the family down, Bull Connor-style. 
</P>
<P>
	His grandfather sighs, ``Should have never let that boy watch  
`Eyes on the Prize.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The strip's most controversial character is Huey's little  
brother, Riley, a pint-sized gangsta wannabe who talks about 
carjacking a neighbor's Lexus. In one panel, he startles the white 
driver of a convertible with two words: ``Nice car.'' The flustered 
driver stumbles into his house as a beaming Riley says, ``Well, 
that oughta keep him awake tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As of last week, The Washington Post had received about 100  
calls, e-mails and letters, and the Los Angeles Times had gotten 
about 250 -- most of them critical. 
</P>
<P>
	``But an almost equal number say the strip portrays their lives  
accurately and with humor, and critically exposes stereotypes,'' 
said Narda Zacchino, the reader representative for the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	In what may be the ultimate tribute, several newspapers have  
plucked ``The Boondocks'' from the comics pages and placed it in 
features sections and on editorial pages alongside ``Doonesbury,'' 
whose creator, Garry Trudeau, said he is impressed by McGruder's 
artistry and daring. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't surprise me that there are some black readers who  
can't personally relate to his fish-out-of-water storylines. But if 
you study the strip closely, you come to see that it's really about 
the universal theme of survival, of just getting through the day,'' 
Trudeau said. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington Post reporter Vanessa Williams, president of the  
National Association of Black Journalists, said she likes the 
strip: ``It's direct, it's honest and it pushes at the edges. I 
think a lot of people don't get it because they haven't heard 
voices like that in their daily, white-bread newspapers.''

<HEADLINE>  Tiger Not Afraid of Change  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- Never satisfied, always trying to find  
another edge, Tiger Woods has never been afraid to change his swing 
and adjust his game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won the U.S. Amateur and said, `I want a new game.' I won  
four events and said, `I don't like it, I need to improve,''' Woods 
said Wednesday as he prepared for today's first round of the $2.5 
million Western Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Coach) Butch Harmon and I tore down my golf swing, rebuilt it  
and I won two more U.S. Amateurs. And I said, `You know what? I 
know I can take it to a new level.' Tear down again and build it 
back up. And that's what we did. I did it in the middle of '97.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods has won two PGA Tour events this year and has three  
straight Top 10 finishes entering the Western, an event he won in 
1997, when he had four titles, including the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods said tinkering with his swing and alleviating problems in  
it is just part of golf. But implementing the changes takes time, 
especially in pressure situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt I have an even more well-rounded game now,'' he said.  
``If you look at the way I played in '97, I did win, yes. But where 
did I finish when I didn't win? I'm finishing higher now when I 
don't have it, which means my swing is better. My short game is 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods will never forget his walk up the 18th at Cog Hill Golf  
and Country Club two years ago. The adoring gallery engulfed him, 
and he's learned to deal with his popularity and the masses that 
follow him when he plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overwhelming, no. Distracting, sometimes. Obviously, they're  
making a lot of noise, and it depends when they make that noise -- 
if it's in your swing or they catch you in a wrong moment, then 
it's a little tough,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods and Vijay Singh, who's placed in the top five of his last  
three tournaments, lead the Western field. U.S. Open champion Payne 
Stewart and money leader David Duval are among those absent. Six of 
the Top 10 money winners are in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	At last year's Western, where Singh finished second, he  
committed to a cross-handed approach. Seven weeks later, he won the 
PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd putted cross-handed before, but this was the first time  
where I said, `This is it.' And I haven't changed since. This is 
the longest streak I've had putting cross-handed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he led after three rounds last year, Singh didn't  
win the Western because Joe Durant was too good on the final day, 
shooting a 66 to win by two strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't lose it. He won it,'' Singh said.

<HEADLINE> Leading Indicators Rise Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A key gauge of future economic activity rose 0.3  
percent in May, more than reversing a 0.1 percent decline in April 
and keeping the U.S. economy on track to achieve its longest 
expansion ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve later raised interest rates for the first  
time in two years, but also signaled it was not preparing further 
rate increases soon, a strategy that should help keep the economy 
growing. Financial markets soared at midafternoon following the 
Fed's announcement, with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index and 
Nasdaq composite index both closing at new highs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a private business group, reported today  
that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators, which spots growth 
trends for the coming three to six months, rose to 107.4 in May 
from 107.1 in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leading indicators show the resilience and robustness of  
this expansion, which is poised to become the longest ever in early 
2000,'' said Michael Boldin, director of business cycle research at 
The Conference Board. ``There is little evidence of cyclical 
imbalances that would jeopardize the economy's stability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The longest economic expansion in U.S. history lasted for 106  
months, from February 1962 until December 1969. The current 
expansion, already the longest peacetime growth ever, would match 
the record if it continues through January 2000 and pass it if it 
lasts until February. 
</P>
<P>
	The Leading Indicators report came as Federal Reserve  
policy-makers were deciding to raise its target for a key 
short-term interest rate by one-quarter of a percentage point in a 
pre-emptive bid to cool the economy's torrid growth and prevent a 
rekindling of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, went to 5 percent from the 4.75 percent that has been in 
effect since Nov. 17. 1998. The widely expected move was the first 
increase since March 25, 1997. What was unexpected was a Fed 
disclosure that it had shifted its bias from raising rates to a 
more neutral stance. 
</P>
<P>
	The move cheered financial markets because it was taken as a  
sign today's rate increase may not be followed by others when Fed 
officials next meet in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average, down more than 50 points just  
before the Fed's action was disclosed, quickly reversed course and 
was up nearly 188 points and above 11,000 before giving up some of 
its gains by the close. The Dow finished the day up 155.45, or by 
1.4 percent, at 10,970.80. 
</P>
<P>
	In the bond market, yields on 30-year Treasury bonds returned  
below 6 percent from 6.06 percent Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In its report, the Conference Board said nine out of 10  
indicators that make up the leading index rose in May. The most 
significant increase came in a slowing of vendor deliveries. Slower 
deliveries means busy manufacturers are backed up in fulfilling 
their orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Another big contributor to the growth in the index was an  
increase in the nation's money supply, indicating that individuals 
and companies have more cash to invest in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Another component, the difference between the yield on 10-year  
Treasury notes and the Federal Reserve's overnight funds rate, also 
rose. That is a sign that financial companies are earning higher 
returns on their loans -- also an incentive to invest, Boldin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices were the only component to show a decrease in May,  
though that was insignificant, the Conference Board said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite slower vendor deliveries, the report showed only a  
slight increase in new orders to manufacturers for consumer goods 
and materials. Average weekly initial claims for unemployment 
insurance rose only slightly, as did building permits and the 
average work week for production workers. 
</P>
<P>
	A component measuring consumer expectations rose slightly in  
May. On Tuesday, the Board reported that its consumer confidence 
index for June rose to its highest level in more than 30 years, 
signaling even stronger economic growth ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board's index of coincident indicators, which measures  
current expansion, rose 0.2 percent in May to 124.1. Its index of 
lagging indicators, which measures recent past performance, was 
flat at 108.4. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading indicators are calculated from a base of 100, set in  
1992. First calculated in the late 1960s, it is periodically 
fine-tuned and figures from past years are revised.

<HEADLINE> Low IQ Leads To Death Row Reversal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- A three-time killer with an IQ of 65 was  
taken off Nebraska's death row Wednesday, saved by a law that bans 
executions of the mentally retarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarence Victor, 66, had his death sentence reduced to life in  
prison because of a state law passed last year that made it illegal 
to execute anyone with an IQ below 70. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pleased,'' defense attorney Mark Weber said. ``He  
leaned over to me and repeatedly said, 'Thank you, thank you, thank 
you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. Ernie Chambers, who sponsored the bill, sat in the  
courtroom with Victor's sister. 
</P>
<P>
	``This law should not have been necessary because no civilized,  
mature society would ever entertain the possibility of executing 
anybody who was mentally retarded,'' Chambers said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	The state attorney general said he would appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	``What this law does is let people with below-average  
intelligence, who do understand that it was wrong to kill, to 
escape the death penalty,'' Attorney General Don Stenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor was sentenced to death in 1988 for the 1987 beating death  
of Alyce Singleton of Omaha. He also had been convicted of 
manslaughter in 1964 for strangling a 40-year-old woman, and of 
second-degree murder in 1976 for slashing the throat of a 
24-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 38 states with capital punishment, Nebraska is one of 12  
that prohibit execution of the mentally retarded.

	LONDON (AP) -- Hold the gossip -- Catherine Zeta-Jones has  
confirmed that she and Michael Douglas have a ``very special 
friendship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the kind of person it's easy to feel good with,'' she  
told this week's Hello! magazine. ``Michael has always been great

</P>
<P>
	Zeta-Jones, the 29-year-old star of ``Entrapment'' and ``The

<HEADLINE> U.S., Canada Sign Salmon Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and Canada signed an  
agreement today aimed at protecting and building up dwindling 
Pacific salmon supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacific Salmon Treaty, agreed to after five years of tough  
negotiations and years of disputes between U.S. and Canadian 
fishermen, revises a 1985 agreement to rebuild wild salmon runs and 
ensure that both sides get a fair share of the catch. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas R. Pickering, acting secretary of state while Madeleine  
Albright is in New York for meetings on Kosovo, and Canadian 
Ambassador Raymond Chtien signed the accord at formal ceremonies in 
the State Department's Treaty Room. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty establishes two regional funds managed by both  
countries to improve fisheries management and enhance cross-border 
scientific cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agreement represents a critical step in the  
administration's long-term strategy for restoring salmon in the 
Pacific Northwest,'' the State Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. negotiators included representatives of the State  
Department, White House, 24 Indian tribes and the states of Alaska, 
Washington and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	The salmon dispute reached a low point in 1997 when Canadian  
fishing boats prevented an Alaska state ferry from departing Prince 
Rupert, British Columbia, after Canadian fishermen claimed 
Americans were taking too many salmon. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal divides up salmon among the two countries' fishermen  
only after ensuring that enough remain to reproduce healthy and 
growing runs, especially of wild chinook, sockeye and coho salmon. 
Some salmon runs are being listed as endangered or threatened under 
the U.S. Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement has the effect of reducing Canada's catch of  
chinook salmon bound for streams in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, 
while giving Canada more of the Fraser River sockeye salmon that 
have been harvested by Washington and Oregon fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska has agreed to reduce its chinook and coho salmon catches.  
</P>
<P>
	Officials on both sides have declared the agreement is in their  
mutual interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement calls for the United States to spend $140 million  
to restore salmon habitat and for other steps to rebuild stocks. 
More than $30 million additional is expected to be needed to buy 
out the licenses of U.S. fishermen who will lose their Fraser 
sockeye harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Trout Unlimited, a fish conservation group, has endorsed the  
agreement with reservations. Some conservationists fear it aims too 
much at increasing the number of fish so more can be caught rather 
than conserving the natural resource.

<HEADLINE> New Deposits Aimed At Elderly, Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Low-income and elderly Americans who receive  
Social Security and other federal benefit checks in the mail are 
getting a new incentive to have the money deposited electronically. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department in cooperation with several banking  
institutions is offering a new low-cost direct-deposit program for 
federal payment recipients. Though recipients already can get their 
checks deposited electronically, many do not. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to save a lot of money for families that don't  
have a lot to spare,'' Vice President Al Gore said Wednesday in 
announcing the changes in a brief appearance with Treasury 
Secretary Robert Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said many elderly and low-income Americans have difficult  
time getting to a bank or do not trust their money with others. 
They end up paying stiff fees to get their checks cashed elsewhere 
and are easy prey for thieves, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new program would allow banking participants to charge  
beneficiaries a maximum fee of $3 a month to handle the electronic 
transfers. Tax refunds, however, are not included. 
</P>
<P>
	Account holders would get a minimum of four cash withdrawals and  
four balance inquiries each month -- either from tellers or through 
automated teller machines -- covered by the $3 fee. The accounts 
would be subject to the same consumer protections that the 
financial institutions make available to other account holders. 

</P>
<P>
	There would be no minimum balance -- except as required by  
federal or state law -- and account holders would get monthly 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial institutions would decide whether to pay interest  
on account balances. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, the government pays each institution a one-time  
per-account fee to set up an account. The program is being offered 
only through federally insured financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The program is believed to save the government money in the long  
run as people switch over to the electronic payment system. That 
would reduce the government's costs for mailing and printing 
benefit checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Many banks, savings and loans, and credit unions already offer  
low-cost checking accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 requires most  
federal payments, except for tax refunds, to eventually be made by 
electronic transfers. Gore's announcement was a step toward 
implementing the act. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore listed the first financial institutions to have preliminary  
agreements to offer the low-cost accounts: Banco Popular de Puerto 
Rico &AMP; NA; Bank of America; Britton &AMP; Koontz First National Bank; 
Chase Manhattan Bank; Washington State Bank; and Wells Fargo &AMP; Co.

<HEADLINE>  Tiger Not Afraid of Change  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- Never satisfied, always trying to find  
another edge, Tiger Woods has never been afraid to change his swing 
and adjust his game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won the U.S. Amateur and said, `I want a new game.' I won  
four events and said, `I don't like it, I need to improve,''' Woods 
said Wednesday as he prepared for today's first round of the $2.5 
million Western Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Coach) Butch Harmon and I tore down my golf swing, rebuilt it  
and I won two more U.S. Amateurs. And I said, `You know what? I 
know I can take it to a new level.' Tear down again and build it 
back up. And that's what we did. I did it in the middle of '97.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods has won two PGA Tour events this year and has three  
straight Top 10 finishes entering the Western, an event he won in 
1997, when he had four titles, including the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods said tinkering with his swing and alleviating problems in  
it is just part of golf. But implementing the changes takes time, 
especially in pressure situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt I have an even more well-rounded game now,'' he said.  
``If you look at the way I played in '97, I did win, yes. But where 
did I finish when I didn't win? I'm finishing higher now when I 
don't have it, which means my swing is better. My short game is 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods will never forget his walk up the 18th at Cog Hill Golf  
and Country Club two years ago. The adoring gallery engulfed him, 
and he's learned to deal with his popularity and the masses that 
follow him when he plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overwhelming, no. Distracting, sometimes. Obviously, they're  
making a lot of noise, and it depends when they make that noise -- 
if it's in your swing or they catch you in a wrong moment, then 
it's a little tough,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods and Vijay Singh, who's placed in the top five of his last  
three tournaments, lead the Western field. U.S. Open champion Payne 
Stewart and money leader David Duval are among those absent. Six of 
the Top 10 money winners are in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	At last year's Western, where Singh finished second, he  
committed to a cross-handed approach. Seven weeks later, he won the 
PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd putted cross-handed before, but this was the first time  
where I said, `This is it.' And I haven't changed since. This is 
the longest streak I've had putting cross-handed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he led after three rounds last year, Singh didn't  
win the Western because Joe Durant was too good on the final day, 
shooting a 66 to win by two strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't lose it. He won it,'' Singh said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Jump on Fed Action / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose sharply in early trading  
Thursday, riding an overnight rally on Wall Street sparked by the 
Federal Reserve's decision to nudge up interest rates. The dollar 
edged higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 321.00 points,  
or 1.83 percent, to 17,850.74 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
On Wednesday, the average closed down 252.05 points, or 1.42 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.90 yen, up 0.04 yen from late Wednesday in  
Tokyo but slightly below its late New York level of 120.93 yen 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo stock market started higher in a follow-through move  
from New York where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 155.45 
points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 10,970.80 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section rose 22.11 points, or 1.56 percent, to 
1,438.31. The TOPIX closed down 9.04 points, or 0.63 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, the Fed raised short-term U.S. interest rates by a  
quarter point -- an anticipated move that did not have a major 
impact on currency trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed did surprise markets, however, by announcing it was  
abandoning its bias toward raising rates further. 
</P>
<P>
	News that the Fed was adopting a neutral stance toward interest  
rates -- meaning it was no longer leaning toward raising them -- sent 
some investors away from the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates mean higher returns on liquid investments  
held in that currency, so the prospect that U.S. rates may not 
increase for a while made the dollar less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the greenback moved lower from its New  
York level after U.S. funds sold dollars to invest in Japanese 
stocks, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said market attention has now shifted to the Bank of  
Japan's ``tankan'' survey of corporate sentiment due out Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't much response to the Fed,'' said a Japanese bank  
trader, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 125.30 yen, up from  
125.06 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government bond fell to  
1.8200 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.8500 percent, driving 
its price up to 99.82 yen from 99.57 yen.

<HEADLINE> MetroStars 2, Mutiny 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Petter Villegas scored the tying  
goal in regulation and then added a score in the shootout Wednesday 
night as the New York-New Jersey MetroStars snapped a six-game 
Major League Soccer losing streak with a 2-1 shootout victory over 
the Tampa Bay Mutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory snapped a club-record losing streak for the  
MetroStars (5-10). Tampa Bay (6-9) has lost four straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay scored two minutes into the second half when Alejandro  
Sequiera converted Carlos Valderrama's pass into a chip shot over 
MetroStars goalkeeper Tim Howard. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-New Jersey knotted the issue in the 73rd minute on  
Villegas' first MLS goal, a shot from the top of the arc that 
whistled past Mutiny keeper Andy Kirk and into the upper right 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-New Jersey won the shootout as Tab Ramos, Villegas and  
Billy Walsh scored against Kirk. Pete Marino and Steve Ralston 
scored for the Mutiny, but Howard saved shots by R.T. Moore, Paul 
Dougherty and Valderrama to preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars missed an opportunity to win the match in  
regulation when Nansha Kalonji's header bounced over the bar in the 
82nd minute.

<HEADLINE>  EU Ends Duty-Free Shopping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Millions of Europeans traveling to  
neighboring nations by plane, boat and hovercraft long have snapped 
up tax-free liquor, tobacco, perfume and other goods at duty-free 
shops. But that's all coming to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	At midnight Wednesday, the European Union was abolishing  
duty-free shopping for travelers within its borders, ending a 
much-cherished institution and a business worth $7 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sad day for consumers,'' said Barry Goddard, secretary  
general of the British Duty Free Confederation, which led a 
campaign to save the travelers' perk. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU's top tax official hailed the demise of duty-free  
shopping, which he had long denounced as an unfair tax break that 
made no sense in the European Union, where border controls have 
largely disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is excellent news for EU taxpayers,'' said Mario Monti,  
the EU tax commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	The demise of duty-free shopping won't wipe out opportunities  
for bargain-hunting travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	Duty-free stores at Europe's airports will stay open for  
travelers in and out of the EU's 15 nations, and those purchases 
will be unaffected by the new ruling. Many duty-free stores say 
they will hold down goods' prices by absorbing the costs of taxes 
and duties, but some airport authorities acknowledge prices of 
alcoholic drinks and tobacco products will rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Travelers seeking cheap drinks and smokes will still be able to  
find a good deal on Europe's ferries, thanks to differences in tax 
levels in the various EU nations. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, British travelers on so-called ``booze cruises'' to  
France can buy beer, wine and spirits much cheaper than at home. As 
soon as a ferry enters French territorial waters, its riders can 
pay the much lower French alcohol taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eighty percent of our customers are British. They have strong  
incentives to buy duty-paid in French waters,'' said Chris Laming 
of P and 0 Stena Lines, which operates 35 daily sailings each way 
between Dover, England, and Calais, France. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Baltic Sea, ferries that take 10 million passengers a  
year between Stockholm, Sweden, and Helsinki, Finland, will now 
detour to the Aland Islands, a self-governing Finnish region that 
successfully lobbied for an exemption from the duty-free ban. 
</P>
<P>
	For Aland -- a Swedish-speaking region of 6,500 islands and  
25,000 people -- winning an exception was matter of survival, its 
governor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If (duty-free shopping) had ended now, shipping here would  
have collapsed immediately, the Aland economy would have 
collapsed,'' said Peter Lindback. ``This is vital for the economic 
interests of the islands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Alands are the most significant duty-free stop among a  
handful of islands and enclaves that will escape the ban, from 
Spain's Canary Islands to Germany's Helgoland. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, people behind the campaign to save duty-free shopping  
predicted dire economic consequences, with tens of thousands of job 
losses, higher ticket prices and cuts to ferry routes. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU's Monti dismissed such talk. He said the EU could provide  
aid if difficulties arise on specific ferry routes. 
</P>
<P>
	EU nations agreed unanimously in 1991 to ban duty-free shopping  
and gave the industry until June 30, 1999, to prepare. Most EU 
leaders later changed their minds, but they needed unanimous 
agreement to overturn the ban and failed to overcome Danish and 
Dutch resistance.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Reveals SEC Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission is  
investigating Microsoft Corp., apparently to review the way the 
company manages its revenue to smooth its financial results, a top 
executive said. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation of the world's largest software maker  
apparently began several months ago and could continue for months 
``or even years,'' Microsoft chief financial officer Greg Maffei 
said in a telephone news conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our understanding is that it is related to reserves and  
reserve policies,'' Maffei said. ``The SEC has requested 
information from Microsoft and we are cooperating fully with the 
SEC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC probe -- under standard rules -- is under a tight cover of  
confidentiality, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maffei said the investigation apparently stemmed from an item in  
the Wall Street Journal on Jan. 14 about settlement of a 
wrongful-discharge lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court by Charles 
Pancerzewski, a former Microsoft internal auditor. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was settled for undisclosed terms and the record  
sealed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal reported that Pancerzewski had accused Microsoft of  
``cookie jar'' accounting, a practice in which revenue in strong 
quarters is set aside as reserves and reported in weaker periods to 
make earnings appear more stable. 
</P>
<P>
	A recorded message on a telephone line listed under  
Pancerzewski's name in Mukilteo said no one at that number was 
taking messages. Maffei would not comment on the case or the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, former Microsoft chief financial officer Mike Brown  
sent chairman Bill Gates an e-mail message that said in part, ``I 
believe we should do all we can to smooth our earnings and keep a 
steady-state earnings model,'' according to a court transcript 
cited by the Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street has generally responded favorably to Microsoft's  
tendency to understate its results. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked whether the SEC might find Microsoft's reporting had  
been overly conservative by design, Maffei replied, ``I don't know 
what their view would be. We are obviously a company that is known 
for conservatism, and I would be surprised if anyone who looked at 
our books would conclude otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday Maffei announced a series of revenue-neutral  
accounting changes and a longer amortization period for Windows, 
the personal computer operating software that is Microsoft's 
best-known product, that will boost earnings by a penny a share in 
the last quarter and a projected penny a share again during 
Microsoft's next fiscal year, which begins Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounting changes were made voluntarily to better reflect  
company operations, while the amortization change was required by 
an SEC regulatory change that was announced in December and is now 
taking effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounting changes will force the company to record money  
received for product support, consulting, certification and 
training of systems integrators and MSN online access as revenue, 
rather than as a reduction in expenses, Maffei said. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the changes involve reserves or have anything to do with  
the SEC probe, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maffei said he was ``very comfortable'' with analyst projections  
for the three months now ending, adding that those figures should 
be adjusted upward a penny a share and another cent for the next 12 
months because of the change.

<HEADLINE> Women Drawing Huge Crowds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For the folks who put together the Women's World Cup, financial  
success was achieved just halfway through the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	For the folks hoping to win the Women's World Cup, the serious  
stuff is only getting started. 
</P>
<P>
	As the quarterfinals begin tonight in San Jose, Calif., with  
China playing Russia and Norway taking on Sweden, ticket sales have 
gone far beyond initial projections. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team, which plays Thursday night against Germany in the  
opener of a doubleheader at Landover, Md. -- followed by 
Brazil-Nigeria -- has played to an average of more than 65,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The non-U.S. games have drawn an average attendance of more than  
21,000, better than 11 of the 30 major league baseball teams 
currently average. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 570,000 tickets have been sold for the tournament, and  
chief organizer Marla Messing boldly predicts the number will soar 
beyond 600,000 if the Americans continue advancing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always believed in the potential of this tournament to  
be very successful, a breakthrough event for women's sports,'' 
Messing said Tuesday. ``But we are frankly in awe of what has 
happened so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That includes some very solid television ratings. ESPN's  
audience for last Thursday's U.S.-Nigeria game drew a 1.85 rating, 
the second-highest soccer match on the network, behind the men's 
World Cup semifinal last year between Brazil and the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Sunday's U.S.-North Korea game on ESPN2 got a 1.96 rating,  
the highest for any soccer match on ESPN2 and the fifth 
most-watched event on the network. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's soccer has been a big hit at the souvenir stands, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's not a story we anticipated,'' Messing said. ``We are  
consistently selling out all merchandise at the stadiums. The 
demand for our products is outstripping your standard demand ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	The story everyone in the United States is anticipating is an  
American advance to the final. But now things get dicey -- there are 
no more soft teams in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Germany is a lot like us,'' U.S. midfielder Julie Foudy said.  
``They are very skillful, hard-working and disciplined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Germans are also not as healthy as the Americans. The  
Germans will be without captain Martina Voss, out with a torn leg 
muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	But even without Voss, Germany still has midfielder Bettina  
Wiegmann. She creates much of the offense and is complemented by 
finishers Inka Grings and Brigit Prinz up front. Prinz has been 
especially dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, so have most of the Americans, who had a 13-1 edge in  
scoring in the first round. Plus, coach Tony DiCicco was able to 
rest key players throughout the opening round. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Akers and Kate Sobrero, both starters, have not played  
since the first half of the second game, against Nigeria. They 
should be fresh. Mia Hamm, Tiffeny Milbrett and Cindy Parlow up 
front and Foudy in midfield also got breathers in the opening 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	The subs, meanwhile, were superb, particularly Tisha Venturini  
(two goals) and Shannon MacMillan (one goal, two assists) against 
North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are playing pretty well,'' DiCicco said. ``But  
there still were a couple of breakdowns we need to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to keep getting better and evolving our game so the  
team you saw on June 19 hopefully will be much better on July 10. 
And we're working to be there on July 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would be in the final at the Rose Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Town Wants To Honor Bob Dylan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HIBBING, Minn. (AP) -- A task force of Hibbing residents is  
considering a center that would honor Bob Dylan, the folk music 
pioneer who grew up here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember a fellow coming from Ireland, and he came to  
Hibbing looking for a Dylan museum. This had to be in the late 
'70s,'' task force member Don Hilligoss said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Dylan was born in Duluth, 75 miles away, but grew up in Hibbing.  
Task force member Ed Beckers said Hibbing's center could have 
performance areas, with proceeds used to fund scholarships for fine 
arts students. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have a place. We don't have anything but this idea.  
We don't have money,'' Beckers said. ``When he left in '59, that's 
all he had too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, New York consultant Susan Phillips is spearheading an  
effort to develop a nonprofit Bob Dylan Digital Arts Center in 
Duluth. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips envisions a privately funded center that would feature  
a library devoted to writings about Dylan and his paintings, as 
well as interactive media and a performance space. It would include 
a screening room featuring video clips, concert footage and Dylan's 
favorite movies.

<HEADLINE> Infertility May Be Passed To Sons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New fertility techniques have enabled men with  
low sperm counts to father children, and sons born to some of these 
men may also be infertile, according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. David C. Page, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute researcher  
at the Whitehead Institute, said that about 10 percent of all men 
who can produce little or no sperm suffer from a genetic defect in 
a part of the Y chromosome. 
</P>
<P>
	When these men father children through in vitro fertilization,  
or IVF, techniques, said Page, their sons tend to inherit the 
genetic defect. Daughters are not affected since females receive 
from their fathers an X chromosome instead of the Y chromosomes. 
</P>
<P>
	This means, said Page, that although IVF may help otherwise  
infertile men produce sons, it will not ensure that there 
eventually will be grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Infertility affects 10 percent to 15 percent of all American  
couples. Men are responsible for about half of infertility 
problems, with an inadequate number of sperm being the most common 
problem. Some men with low sperm counts have a genetic flaw in a 
part of the Y chromosome known as the AZFc. 
</P>
<P>
	A normal sperm count is 50 million to 200 million per cubic  
centimeter of ejaculate. Men with the AZFc genetic mutation may 
have sperm counts of zero to only 5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Page said the AZFc part of the Y chromosome plays a key role in  
the production of sperm. For reasons not understood, he said, some 
men develop a mutation of the AZFc. Since the condition causes 
infertility, the mutation is not thought to be inherited. 
</P>
<P>
	Before IVF, such men were unlikely to father children. However,  
an IVF technique called intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or ICSI, 
enables test tube conception with a single sperm. 
</P>
<P>
	The ICSI technique involves injecting a single sperm into an egg  
in a laboratory dish. When an embryo develops, it is transferred 
into the fallopian tube of the mother and can result in a normal 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Daughters born from this technique are normal, but Page said  
that a genetic study of four sons born to men with flawed AZFc 
genes were found to share the flaw. The study is published this 
week in the journal Human Reproduction. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study is the first to demonstrate that ICSI does result  
in some men passing the genetic flaw responsible for their 
infertility on to their sons,'' said Page. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery may lead prospective parents to ask that their  
doctor determine the gender of an embryo, said Page. Only female 
embryos would be implanted into the mother. This could ensure that 
the baby would be a fertile daughter instead of an infertile son. 
</P>
<P>
	Page said it is possible that the AZFc flaw may cause the sperm  
count to drop only with age, and that men with the genetic flaw may 
have normal sperm counts during puberty and early adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
	If that is the case, he said, sperm could be collected in the  
male's youth and then frozen until he is ready to start a family.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- He was just a pipsqueak then, a rail-thin,  
curly-haired goofball who was blessed -- or cursed -- with a sly 
smile and a Gatling-gun mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	John Leguizamo was 14 in the summer of '77. New York City was  
sweltering. The discos were hotter. And there was a maniac out 
there with a .44-caliber handgun. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember it. Yeah, I do,'' Leguizamo says. ``It was coming  
of age for me. That whole summer, I was on a mission. I was trying 
to de-virginize myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At night, he remembers, he would put on his Lothario outfit: a  
three-piece Polyester disco suit and an unbuttoned shirt with huge 
lapels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would take my mother's mascara and draw a mustache and a  
beard. I would go to clubs with a fake ID from Times Square. I 
would say, 'Hey, lemme in. I'm a midget, man!''' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, he recalls, the bodies continued to mount.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was paranoia. People wouldn't even hang out in the  
streets. Lovers' lanes were empty. I used to bike there all the 
time to see if I could learn something -- you know, through all the 
fogged up windows. But there wasn't anything. It was creepy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-two summers later, Leguizamo has returned to those  
murderous days in Spike Lee's ``Summer of Sam,'' a story about 
neighborhood friends living during the Son of Sam's bloody reign. A 
former postal worker named David Berkowitz was arrested 22 years 
ago and confessed to fatally shooting six people and wounding seven 
others. He later said he took orders from a neighbor's black 
Labrador retriever named Sam. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbian-born Leguizamo, now 35, was a natural choice as the  
film's lead. He was raised here, after all, skipping from one 
working-class neighborhood to the next throughout his adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
	He studied theater at New York University and dabbled in  
stand-up comedy before earning attention with his quirky one-man, 
off-Broadway shows, ``Mambo Mouth'' and ``Spic-O-Rama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After making his film debut as a soldier in ``Casualties of  
War,'' he tried to kill Harrison Ford in ``Regarding Henry'' and 
succeeded in offing Al Pacino in ``Carlito's Way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a little tired of being the guy that gets shot in the  
first half-hour, or the messenger. I love villains and I love 
gangsters, but it has to be three-dimensional -- got to have respect 
and dignity. Well, as much as a drug dealer can have respect and 
dignity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was mostly unarmed and drug-free in ``Hangin' With the  
Homeboys,'' ``Whispers in the Dark'' and ``Super Mario Bros,'' but 
packed a weapon in ``Revenge,'' ``William Shakespeare's Romeo &AMP; 
Juliet'' and ``Die Hard 2.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leguizamo made jaws drop as a cross-dressing diva in 1995's ``To  
Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar'' and as Clown, a 
corpulent demon who spewed bawdy one-liners in ``Spawn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also launched the raucous but short-lived Fox TV  
sketch-comedy series ``House of Buggin,''' becoming the first 
Latino since Desi Arnaz to star in, co-write and co-produce a 
prime-time show. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't easy, he says. Before Sammy Sosa began crushing  
baseballs, or Jennifer Lopez and Ricky Martin showed up in tight 
pants, Leguizamo found the mainstream running mostly uphill. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, of course, America has been bitten by the Latin bug.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time, man,'' he says. ``Thank God! People now know  
that we've got really good-looking Latin people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The talent's always been there,'' he adds. ``The inroads that  
Latin people have made are still not as close as what they should 
be, but we've put our mark on this country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the most important talent that we need to nurture is  
the writers. That's where you get the intellect of a culture -- the 
ideas, the soul,'' he says. ``It's just a matter of our stories 
being told. And they are being told.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Told mostly by Leguizamo himself. Last year, he won raves and  
two Tony nominations for his Broadway show, ``Freak,'' dubbed a 
``semi-demi-quasi-pseudo-autobiographical comedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Freak'' celebrated Leguizamo's dysfunctional parents; The  
spare, one-man show winked at sex, his fat brother and strutting 
friends; it lampooned Irish lasses, Italian toughs, Latino 
attitudes, love and more sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's free,'' says Leguizamo's ``Summer of Sam'' co-star,  
Adrien Brody. ``He doesn't censor himself. A lot of people are 
worried about taking risks. Not John. And when someone is taking a 
risk, it's easier to take a risk yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His parents, however, were horrified: Mom came off equal parts  
smothering and neglectful -- a sort of protective disco queen -- 
while Dad emerged as a physically abusive, raging alcoholic waiter. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened is that I wrote it and it was easy to write  
because there were no repercussions,'' he says. ``I thought I was 
doing it TO them. When I took it to Broadway, I realized, 'Oh my 
God, I was doing it to MYSELF.''' 
</P>
<P>
	And now? ``I feel now I'm OK with it,'' he replies.  
</P>
<P>
	Based in part on the strength of ``Freak,'' Leguizamo signed a  
first-look deal with Miramax Films to develop movie and TV 
projects. After Spike Lee's new flick, he has two more coming out, 
both with regal names: ``Joe the King'' and ``King of the Jungle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then it's off to rub shoulders with Ewan McGregor and Nicole  
Kidman in director Baz Luhrmann's ``Moulin Rouge,'' a musical set 
in the Paris of 1899. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-time pipsqueak has finally got some Hollywood pull.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a little clout,'' he says, modestly, like a little boy.  
``Yeah!'' he reconsiders, lifting his arms in the air. ``I've got 
huge clout. My clout! Raise the roof! I love my clout.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One critic doesn't care and has already given Leguizamo's new  
film about the summer '77 a thumbs-down. The critic is Berkowitz 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	From inside Sullivan Correctional Facility, a maximum-security  
prison in upstate New York, Berkowitz told The New York Times he's 
unhappy ``Summer of Sam'' dredges up the awful past. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's interesting that Berkowitz feels that he still has  
rights. I mean, of course, it's America and I respect the 
Constitution and I'd love to hear what he has to say. But at the 
end of day, it doesn't have any weight,'' Leguizamo says. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has no rights about how his image is portrayed, or how his  
image is misportrayed. You killed eight people! You took people's 
lives, man. What happened to their rights?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leguizamo isn't scared any more.

<P>
	CIUDAD DEL ESTE, Paraguay (AP) -- In a dazzling display of  
offensive weaponry, Brazil's Ronaldo and Amoroso scored two goals 
each as Brazil routed Venezuela 7-0 Wednesday in its first Copa 
America match. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil notched five goals in the second half with a rejuvenated  
Ronaldo leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronaldo scored his first goal in the 26th minute as the two-time  
FIFA player of the year showed he may have fully recovered from a 
knee injury last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The best goal of the night went to Ronaldhino, the Brazilian  
youngster being billed as ``Ronaldo II.'' Lifting the ball over the 
head of a Venezuelan defender, Ronaldhino sprinted around him to 
drill the team's fifth goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Emerson and Rivaldo had the other Brazil goals.

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Jane Beadon, one of the leading witnesses in the  
sensational divorce case of the 11th Duke of Argyll, died 
Wednesday. She was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Beadon was Jane Wigham in 1963 when she gave evidence  
against her stepdaughter Margaret, the Duchess of Argyll. 
</P>
<P>
	The divorce of Ian Douglas Campbell, 11th Duke of Argyll, chief  
of the Clan Campbell and Hereditary Master of the Royal Household 
in Scotland, and his wife made headlines worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The case became notorious because of the mysterious ``headless  
man'' photographs. The pictures showed the duchess, wearing only 
three strands of pearls, taking part in a sex act with a naked man, 
whose head had been cut off by the camera. He has never been 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The duke began divorce proceedings on grounds of adultery, and  
Jane Wigham gave evidence on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	The duke was granted a divorce. In his ruling, the judge called  
the duchess promiscuous and ``wholly immoral.'' She died in 1993 at 
age 80.

</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- William M.B. Berger, the white-bearded founder of  
the Berger Funds, died Tuesday. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger came from a long line of bankers. His grandfather founded  
the Colorado National Bank in 1862. At age 26, Berger began 
managing a $100 million stock portfolio for the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1960, Berger discovered the Centennial Fund, the first  
tax-free exchange fund. It allowed investors to trade their shares 
of stock for shares of the fund without incurring a tax liability. 
Then the Internal Revenue Service changed its rules to stop the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1966, he merged his Centennial Management Co. with Founders  
before starting the funds that bear his name eight years later. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his own commercials, Berger made appearances on  
Wall Street Week and on several of CNBC's financial talk shows.

<P>
	EPPING, N.D. (AP)-- Cindy Duehring, a woman who won international  
honors for environmental research while being confined to her North 
Dakota home, died Tuesday. She was 36 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy Duehring died in her home where she lived in isolation  
because of an extreme sensitivity to chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her organ system just broke down,'' said her husband, Jim, who  
was forced to live in a nearby cabin because the smells that clung 
to him after a day at work made his wife sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Duehring was among five people honored in Sweden in 1997  
with the Right Livelihood Awards, known as the ``alternative 
Nobels.'' Her husband flew to Sweden to accept her award. 
</P>
<P>
	She founded the Environmental Access Research Network, a group  
to help people suffering from chemical sensitivity, and answered 
hundreds of research requests per month. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Duehring traced her illness to the mid-1980s when an  
exterminator sprayed her Seattle apartment for fleas. Tests by a 
specialist in environmental medicine found pesticides had damaged 
her immune system.

<P>
	ELKHART, Ind. (AP) -- Frank Gach, an American imprisoned at the  
Auschwitz concentration camp for selling commodities on the Polish 
black market, died Monday. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1942, Gach and a group of his friends were discovered by the  
Nazis and arrested. Gach was taken to Auschwitz, one of the Nazi 
concentration camps where more than 6 million Jews and other people 
were executed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gach suffered severe injuries to both legs, but instead of being  
killed by the Nazis, he was let go. Of thousands of Americans who 
were imprisoned in the death camps, Gach was among the 
approximately 200 who made it out alive. 
</P>
<P>
	He stayed in Poland until 1959, then gathered up his wife and  
five children and came back to the United States.

<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- John P. Howe, a physical chemist who helped  
develop the world's first nuclear reactors as part of the famed 
Manhattan Project team, died June 13. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Howe was a 32-year-old chemistry professor at Brown University  
when he was recruited to study nuclear energy under physicist and 
Nobel Prize laureate Arthur Compton at the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the code name ``Metallurgical Laboratory,'' the team  
sought to create the world's first self-sustaining nuclear chain 
reaction. On Dec. 2, 1942, the Manhattan Project succeeded. By 
1944, large plutonium-producing reactors were operating in Hanford, 
Washington. Howe moved there to act as the Metallurgical 
Laboratory's liaison.

<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Harold Rosenthal, a sports writer  
and author who covered baseball and football in a career that 
spanned five decades, died Tuesday. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenthal worked for more than three decades for the New York  
Herald Tribune, and was especially noted for his baseball coverage 
from 1947 through 1963. He reported on games of the Giants,

into public relations, first with the Continental Football League. 
After working briefly for the New York Giants, he became public 
relations director of the American Football League and, when it 
merged with the NFL, he served as director of information for the 
American Football Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He left the NFL in 1974 and worked briefly as public relations

<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Tom Williams, a retired sportswriter and editor

``The African Queen'' and ``Oliver!'' to the silver screen, died 
Monday. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	After his father's death in 1942, Woolf became a managing  
director. In 1948 he founded his own company, Romulus Films, with 
his brother James.

<HEADLINE> EU To Probe Formula One Racing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Commission put a speed  
bump in front of Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone's auto racing 
and media empire, opening a formal investigation into antitrust 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union's executive commission said today it had told  
the FIA, the organization which runs the multi-billion-dollar 
international motor racing, it has been ``abusing its dominant 
position and restricting competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said it had sent a similar warning to two  
companies controlled by Ecclestone and involved in the selling and 
marketing of broadcast rights to major international auto races. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most significant conclusions of its preliminary  
investigation is that commercial contracts involving auto sports 
business, particularly those involving broadcasters, infringed EU 
competition law, according to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``These contracts would therefore have to be renegotiated if the  
Commission's view is ultimately confirmed,'' the EC statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reopening the contracts could seriously hamper Ecclestone's  
plans to float his business, since he received a $1.4 billion 
eurobond issue based on those rights only in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The eurobond issue was underwritten by Morgan Stanley of the  
United States and Germany's Westdeutsche Landesbank. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue was scaled back from a planned $2 billion deal after  
investors failed to show enough enthusiasm to support that amount. 
</P>
<P>
	The EC probe also concluded that the Federation Internationale  
de l'Automobile (FIA) abused its dominant hold over motor racing to 
restrict competition. 
</P>
<P>
	It did this, said EU spokesmen, by requiring Formula One  
competitors and business partners to have licenses with FIA, which 
it could cancel if they dealt with any competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	FIA also threatened to pull its business from any track that was  
the site for a competing race, the EC said. 
</P>
<P>
	FIA blocked the start-up of a proposed GT touring car race  
circuit by these means, on the grounds that it would compete with 
FIA events, according to the EC. 
</P>
<P>
	The EC move to a formal investigation came after two years of  
informal work on the issue, during which it received two formal 
complaints and ``many'' informal complaints about FIA's tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	FIA, and Ecclestone's two companies, Formula One Administration  
and International Sportsworld Communicators, have time to reply to 
the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	The maximum penalty, if the EC upholds the decision, would be 10  
percent of the turnover of the companies involved. 
</P>
<P>
	But EU Commission spokesman Stephan Rating said it was too early  
to discuss the amount of fines: ``This is only the start of the 
procedure. If we reach a final decision, fines are discretionary.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed in Tenn. Gas Tank Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIVINGSTON, Tenn. (AP) -- Two storage tanks containing crude oil  
and natural gas exploded today, killing two people and injuring 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion occurred about 7:30 a.m. CDT as workers repaired  
the tanks, which are located in a field about 500 feet from the 
nearest home, Overton County Sheriff's Department Sgt. Tim Poore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A third tank was threatened by the flames, but did not explode.  
The fire was extinguished in about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston is on the Cumberland Plateau, about 85 miles east of  
Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Tennessee's oil supply is found in Overton County and  
other areas along the plateau. Underground geological formations 
there include folds in the limestone where oil is trapped in wide, 
shallow pools.

<HEADLINE> Honduran Boy Admits Tale Was a Lie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was an incredible story. It simply wasn't  
true. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen-year-old Honduran native Edwin Sabillon had New Yorkers  
reaching for their handkerchiefs with a heartbreaking tale of how 
Hurricane Mitch had killed his family and how he had trekked 3,200 
miles to New York to be with a father he'd never met. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived alone Sunday at LaGuardia Airport, and a concerned  
taxi driver took him to police. After the story broke, hundreds of 
people offered gifts and clothes; some said they'd adopt Edwin if 
his father didn't appear. 
</P>
<P>
	But then the little boy with a sweet smile and a big imagination  
admitted to police Tuesday that his headline-grabbing story was 
just that -- a story. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives interviewed the boy after his grandmother in Honduras  
told The Associated Press that the story Edwin had given 
authorities was false. His maternal grandmother told the AP that 
the boy's mother is alive and his father is dead. She said he was a 
runaway. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin admitted that he had lied, and that he knew his father was  
dead and his mother is alive, according to a police statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why he did this -- maybe because he wants to live  
in the United States,'' said Paula Vazquez Hernandez, 65, who lives 
in San Buenaventura, Honduras. ``He loves me, and I adore him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Vazquez Hernandez said Edwin's father, Grevis Sabillon,  
died of AIDS shortly after returning to Honduras from Miami last 
October. The boy's mother lives in the northern Honduras industrial 
town of Choloma, but abandoned him when he was an infant, Mrs. 
Vazquez Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin was living with an aunt in Miami but returned to Honduras  
when his father died, his grandmother said. In March, he left to 
live with one of two aunts in Hialeah, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Vazquez Hernandez did not know how he got there, but  
guessed that he probably hitched rides on trucks. Police said she 
reported to Hialeah authorities on Thursday that Edwin had run 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Edwin went to a cafeteria in Miami on Saturday and  
told his tale to people who bought him a bus ticket to New York 
City. He arrived in New York on Sunday and took a cab to the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
	When the cabbie brought Edwin to police on Sunday, the boy told  
officers that his mother, brother and grandfather died in a mud 
slide last year when Hurricane Mitch pummeled Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin also said his father sent him $200 on May 19 and told him  
to meet him at LaGuardia on either June 25, 26 or 27, police said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be wearing a white shirt, black pants, white sneakers  
and a black hat,'' Edwin said his father told him, according to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Edwin's admission, New York police had spent Monday and  
Tuesday looking for his father. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani urged him to 
come forward. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear what would happen to the boy, who is staying  
with a Spanish-speaking foster family in the city. Police 
Commissioner Howard Safir said the officers would continue to 
investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin's grandmother said she just wants him to come home.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll put him in a reform school until he straightens out,''  
she said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sydney Helps Blind Get Olympic Tix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Sydney Olympic organizers have opened a  
phone line to help blind people apply for tickets following a 
complaint to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint, lodged on behalf of Bruce Maguire, claimed  
discrimination because SOCOG had not provided a braille version of 
the official ticket book. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's interim finding required SOCOG to maintain  
Maguire's rights to apply for tickets after the July 16 deadline 
until a final determination could be made. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG denied there was discrimination and is discussing the  
decision with the commission. It has set up six phone lines to 
assist the vision impaired, with specially trained operators who 
can fill out ticket order forms and then mail them to applicants to 
be signed and returned. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG said Wednesday that it had been advised by the Royal Blind  
Society that documents were usually only published in braille if 
they were used for repeated reference. 
</P>
<P>
	A society spokesman said that only a few thousand of the  
approximately 300,000 legally blind people in Australia were 
braille readers.

<HEADLINE> Gay Parent Visitation Rights Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Gay people who help their partners raise a child  
have visitation rights after the couples break up, the state's 
highest court has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Judicial Court ruled Tuesday in the case of a  
lesbian who helped her partner raise her son, saying the woman was 
``de facto'' -- or ``in fact'' -- a parent of the child. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is to be expected that children of nontraditional families,  
like other children, form parent relationships with both parents, 
whether those parents are legal or de facto,'' Justice Ruth Abrams 
wrote for the four-member majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Gay and lesbian parents can adopt in Massachusetts, which would  
make them legal parents. But in the case considered by the court, 
the non-biological parent had not adopted the child. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Charles Fried, in a strongly worded dissent, said  
allowing visitation ``was wholly without warrant in statute, 
precedent or any known legal principle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also charged that the court was taking an unwarranted step  
toward endorsing same-sex marriages, calling the decision 
``judicial lawmaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Buseck, executive director of Gay and Lesbian Advocates and  
Defenders that helped bring the case to the courts, lauded the 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great victory for the kids,'' he said. ``It's  
certainly a victory for gay and lesbian families.''

<HEADLINE> Fed Expected To Raise Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After lowering interest rates last fall to  
protect the U.S. economy from global financial turmoil, the Federal 
Reserve is now ready to raise rates to cool an economy it considers 
to be growing too rapidly for its own good, private economists 
believe. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets nervously awaited the expected mid-afternoon  
announcement at the close of the second day of meetings of the 
Federal Open Market Committee, the panel that sets interest rates. 
Analysts believe the Fed will decide to raise rates, based on 
recent remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices fell in early trading today with the Dow Jones  
industrial average down 62 points following two days of solid gains 
as bargain hungers had pushed prices higher in light trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists believe the Fed will be able to accomplish a ``soft  
landing'' in which growth slows enough to keep inflation in check 
without the economy toppling into a recession. They took 
encouragement from a report today showing a solid 0.3 percent rise 
in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, designed to forecast 
the economy's future course. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the May indicators advance showed the economy has  
enough momentum to withstand the rate increase Greenspan and other 
Fed officials have signalled was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greenspan in his June 17 congressional testimony virtually  
guaranteed a quarter-point tightening move,'' said David Jones, 
chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	At that appearance two weeks ago, Greenspan said, ``When we can  
be pre-emptive, we should be, because modest pre-emptive actions 
can obviate the need of more drastic actions at a later date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed under Greenspan has preferred to be forward-looking,  
moving to raise interest rates before higher inflation has a chance 
to take off. In the past, Fed policy-makers waited too long to 
start raising rates, meaning they had to push interest rates so 
high that the economy was often knocked into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1994, the Greenspan-chaired Fed launched a  
pre-emptive strike against inflation with a series of seven rate 
hikes that succeeded in bringing about a soft-landing with growth 
slowing enough to keep inflation in check but not so much that a 
recession occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed started raising rates again in March 1997, but stopped  
that time after only a one quarter-point move as the global economy 
became embroiled in the Asian currency crisis. Before that turmoil 
was over, the Fed last fall engineered three rate cuts to keep 
overseas troubles from disrupting U.S. prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed critics charge that it is being too hasty to consider  
raising rates now with only a fragile global recovery under way. 
</P>
<P>
	``The risks of raising rates are far greater than any benefits  
that might be achieved,'' said economist Jerry Jasinowski, 
president of the National Association of Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism ahead of the Fed decision was coming not only from  
conservative business groups but also from liberal labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Working families will pay the price of a mistaken  
tightening,'' AFL-CIO President John Sweeney complained at a 
Capitol Hill rally last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists believe, however, that Greenspan and his  
colleagues have become convinced that the U.S. economy must slow in 
order to take pressure off tight U.S. labor markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment has fallen to the lowest levels in three decades,  
currently at 4.2 percent. While inflationary wage pressures have 
not yet become evident, Fed policy-makers are concerned that many 
of the factors that contributed to low inflation last year -- 
falling oil prices and weak global demand -- are beginning to 
reverse, setting the stage for a potential inflationary surge, 
especially with U.S. consumer demand remaining so strong. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best news is clearly over for inflation,'' said David  
Wyss, chief financial economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyss said he expects a June rate hike to be followed by one more  
increase some time in the early fall. He said the Fed may then be 
willing to sit on the sidelines to watch and see if the economy 
slows as expected. Wyss said one factor arguing against a rate 
increase late in the year is the concern the central bank has about 
the effects the Year 2000 computer problem will have on the banking 
system and the U.S. economy in general. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said he is looking for three rate increases beginning at  
this meeting and then again in August and either October or 
November. He said he believes the Fed will hurry to finish its rate 
hikes this year so that it can remain on the sidelines during next 
year's presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed likes to get any tightening out of the way before an  
election year,'' Jones said. ``It's a delicate situation to be 
changing policy during a presidential election and the Fed usually 
goes out of its way to avoid doing so.''

<HEADLINE> Fair, Whalen, Roberts Lead Cheers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANDOVER, Md. (AP) -- Lorrie Fair, Sara Whalen and Tiffany  
Roberts had their fun on the field in the first round of the 
Women's World Cup. As the Americans play in the second round 
tonight against Germany, that trio will go back to being 
cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
	You won't hear them complaining.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're in this together, and I know you hear that a lot, but  
it's true for this team,'' Fair said. ``It's OK coming off the 
bench. Of course, I'm not used to it, but you accept the role given 
to you, whether it's a starter or a reserve or a cheerleader. You 
know a time will come when you'll be needed and you have to be 
ready. Until then, you do the best job you can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fair, an alternate in the 1996 Olympics, is a college star. She  
has one season of eligibility remaining at North Carolina, where 
she will be a favorite for the player of the year award after being 
a nominee in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	When she looks at the talent surrounding her on the American  
team, she doesn't fret about riding the bench. When her opportunity 
comes, as it did in a first-round runaway against Nigeria, she 
jumps all over it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I'd be nervous,'' she said of her World Cup debut,  
``but (assistant coach) Lauren Gregg said, `You need to do this and 
do that' to be ready. So all the nerves went away even before I got 
on the field. It's like, `You're in, now go and have fun.' 
</P>
<P>
	``We were having so much fun on the bench that it was almost as  
tiring as playing. Every time we scored, we'd be celebrating so 
much that we'd have to sit down and recover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whalen also got into the Nigeria game, and she played the entire  
way against North Korea in the last opening-round match. A 
three-time All-American at Connecticut, Whalen might be the fastest 
player on the squad. She displays tremendous composure for a 
23-year-old with limited international experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Tony DiCicco said he never hesitates about using Whalen.  
She has responded with steady performances and authoritative play. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's Tony. He definitely wants to spread the leadership on  
the team,'' Whalen said. ``It's a good idea for the future. When 
some of the veteran leaders are gone, we must step up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony makes sure we all get to play in key situations. And when  
we don't play, we watch, we cheer and we try to learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts, who played the first 73 minutes against North Korea, is  
just 22. Despite her youth, she is in her sixth year of work with 
the national team, and, in 1995, started at right midfield. A 
backup now, Roberts has completed her college eligibility. Look for 
her to move back into the lineup heading toward the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you are on the bench on this great a team, it's not a big  
deal,'' she said. ``We all get our opportunities and we all have to 
stay sharp for those chances, and make something of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight, they probably won't do much more than offer support for  
the regulars. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're needed,'' Fair said, ``we'll be there. Everybody  
knows that.''

<HEADLINE> Fleury Talks With Colorado Hit Snag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The prospect of Theo Fleury staying with the  
Colorado Avalanche dimmed with the announcement that salary talks 
have not even started because of the right wing's insistence on a 
no-trade clause. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want a no-trade contract, regardless of the content of  
that agreement,'' general manager Pierre Lacroix said Tuesday. 
``We're not going to hurt the chemistry of this club for one 
contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barring a major surprise, Fleury will become an unrestricted  
free agent Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacroix conceded that uncertainty about the team's ownership is  
``a very delicate situation.'' But he said that did not rule out 
the possibility of making Fleury a significant offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ascent Entertainment has reopened bids on the Avalanche, Denver  
Nuggets and the new Pepsi Center after shareholders sued to block a 
$400 million sale to Bill Laurie and his wife, Nancy, an heiress to 
the Wal-Mart fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche acquired Fleury in March from the Calgary Flames,  
the only other team he has played for. The 30-year-old Fleury 
became the Flames' career scoring leader this year, with 364 goals 
and 466 assists in 791 games. 
</P>
<P>
	His acquisition was seen as a boost to Colorado's playoff  
chances three years after its Stanley Cup title. The Avalanche made 
it to the Western Conference finals, losing to eventual champion 
Dallas in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacroix said he talked to Fleury's agent, Don Baizley, over the  
weekend and again on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty clear they've elected to see the open market and  
what's available,'' Lacroix said. ``We understand their position. 
We respect that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury, the best player available in a thin free-agent group, is  
expected to attract several suitors, including the New York 
Rangers, who are reportedly ready with an offer in the five-year, 
$40 million range. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's other major unrestricted free agents, left wing  
Valeri Kamensky and defenseman Sylvain Lefebvre, also appear 
destined to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacroix said Kamensky's agent told him his client wants to test  
free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacroix said the Avalanche did not try to re-sign Lefebvre in  
part because of upcoming prospects, such as 1998 No. 1 pick Martin 
Skoula.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Man Kills Wife After Stroke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUTLER, Pa. (AP) -- A 78-year-old man has been charged with  
suffocating his wife of 54 years in a nursing home because he 
``couldn't stand looking at her'' after her second stroke, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Marchetto visited his 75-year-old wife, Thelma, every day  
since her second stroke in March, nursing home staff said. She 
suffered her first about a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest stroke left her paralyzed on both sides, and she was  
placed in St. Francis Nursing Center North in Cranberry Township. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was able to speak. Movement was difficult,'' said Jennifer  
Fuller, a spokeswoman for the nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a nurse walked into the room and saw Marchetto  
standing over his wife's bed with his hands over her neck and a bed 
sheet over her head, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The nurse asked what he was doing and he replied, ``I couldn't  
stand looking at her,'' police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A white plastic bag was over her head, police said. She died two  
days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Marchetto told others that his wife had suffered enough since  
her first stroke 10 years earlier, police said. He was released 
into the custody of his daughter, who lives in Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> McLachlan Talks To Spin Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sarah McLachlan wants to make one thing clear  
about the Lilith Fair -- it's not a concert for ``white chicks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what stereotype about the all-female music festival  
bothered her, the singer said: ``That it's a white chick folkfest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We invited artists who play all different kinds of music, but  
because of who said yes, it became this `White Chick with an 
Acoustic Guitar' thing,'' she says in the August edition of Spin 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the artists at last year's fair was rapper Missy  
``Misdemeanor'' Elliott. McLachlan, the founder of the Lilith Fair, 
said Elliott was the biggest diva of the festival. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was actually very sweet, but her whole production was  
kinda closed off. Backstage, I approach everyone and try and talk 
to them a bit, but it just didn't happen,'' said McLachlan. ``It 
was a real us-and-them attitude, which was a drag because I was 
really excited about her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLachlan says this year's Lilith Fair tour, beginning July 8,  
will be the last. Besides McLachlan, acts include Sheryl Crow, 
Monica and the Dixie Chicks.

<HEADLINE> WR Grace To Set Up Education Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal securities regulators have secured an  
agreement by chemicals maker W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. to set up a $1 
million educational fund as part of their campaign against 
falsified financial reporting by big companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The new fund, announced Wednesday, is part of an agreement  
between W.R. Grace and the Securities and Exchange Commission to 
settle allegations that the company fraudulently manipulated 
earnings of a former subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC also announced a related settlement with two partners of  
W.R. Grace's auditing firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said that the partners, Eugene F. Gaughan and Thomas J.  
Scanlon, failed to comply with auditing standards and played a role 
in W.R. Grace's alleged financial reporting violations. Without 
admitting to or denying the allegations, Gaughan and Scanlon agreed 
in the settlement to refrain from causing future violations. 
</P>
<P>
	W.R. Grace, based in Boca Raton, Fla., also neither admitted to  
nor denied the SEC's allegations in its settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are settling the case because we think it is in the best  
interests of our employees and our shareholders to put this matter 
behind us,'' the company said in a statement. ``The issues involved 
in this case relate to things that happened several years ago. 
Grace today is a different company with a new leadership team in 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a lawsuit filed in December in federal court in Miami, the  
SEC alleged that former top managers of W.R. Grace misled investors 
from 1991 to 1995 by manipulating the income and growth rate of the 
company and its health care division in financial reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Accurate financial reporting is the cornerstone of our capital  
markets,'' SEC Enforcement Director Richard Walker said in a 
statement. ``This case makes plain that we will not tolerate 
efforts to play fast and loose with the accounting rules to meet 
earnings targets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $1 million fund will be used to foster awareness and  
education concerning financial reporting and accounting principles, 
the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt has been pushing publicly traded  
companies to improve their financial reporting and avoid 
manipulating their earnings to meet Wall Street analysts' 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
	Still pending are the agency's allegations of fraud against six  
former officials of W.R. Grace and a former subsidiary, National 
Medical Care Inc. They include Jean-Paul Bolduc, a former W.R. 
Grace president, chief executive officer and chief operating 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing before an administrative law judge at the SEC has been  
scheduled for September. 
</P>
<P>
	In its suit against W.R. Grace, the SEC alleged that senior  
officials of the company and National Medical Care falsely reported 
results in quarterly and annual statements. The agency said W.R. 
Grace deferred reporting income earned by National Medical Care 
mainly to ``smooth'' the earnings of W.R. Grace's health care 
division, of which National Medical Care was its main component. 
</P>
<P>
	W.R. Grace used reserve funds to manipulate the reported  
earnings of the health care division and the parent company, the 
SEC charged. It said the excess reserves were used mainly to bring 
the health care division's results in line with W.R. Grace's 
financial targets and to increase its earnings per share. 
</P>
<P>
	National Medical Care, once described as the world's largest  
kidney dialysis company, was spun off by W.R. Grace in June 1996 
and merged with a German firm.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Center Puts on French Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- This capital's Kennedy Center for the  
Performing Arts is hosting its first play in French: Pierre 
Marivaux' 269-year-old comedy ``Le Jeu de l'Amour et du Hasard'' 
(``The Game of Love and Chance).'' 
</P>
<P>
	A full house at the center's Eisenhower Theater last night had  
the benefit of subtitles in English, enabling those who watched 
them to catch some of the laughs sooner than the rest of the 
audience. For those with a smattering of French, the performance 
had a triple focus: the actors, their lines in French and a rapid 
barrage of translations flashed on a screen high above them. 
</P>
<P>
	The plot, with the heroine posing as her maid and the hero as  
his valet, took some concentration to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	The company of the Theatre des Amandiers, with Caroline Proust  
starring as Silvia, went through the 140-minute performance with no 
intermission. There were several interruptions for laughs and

<HEADLINE> Amish Men Sentenced for Drug Roles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Two Amish men received a year in prison  
Wednesday for buying cocaine from bikers and selling it among youth 
groups in their strict religious community. 
</P>
<P>
	Abner Stoltzfus, 25, and Abner King Stoltzfus, 24, Lancaster  
County men who are not related, are members of the Old Order Amish, 
the most conservative Anabaptist sect. 
</P>
<P>
	They eschew automobiles, electricity, computers, fancy clothes  
and most other modern conveniences, and use horse-driven buggies 
for transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	``These defendants ... were responsible for bringing disrepute  
to themselves, their families and their community,'' U.S. District 
Judge Clarence C. Newcomer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 200 Amish, some holding babies, packed the courtroom and  
hallway outside. All were clad in traditional Amish dress -- women 
in dark smocks and white bonnets, men in suspenders and straw hats. 
As Newcomer read the sentences, many wept quietly or buried their 
faces in their hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men apologized to the judge and said they have turned their  
lives around since their arrest in June 1998, returning to their 
religious roots and spreading the word in the Amish community about 
the dangers of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was a teen-ager I got with the wrong crowd. ... I've  
changed my life around (and) gave my heart and soul to God,'' Abner 
Stoltzfus said. ``I apologize deep from the bottom of my heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A sobbing Abner King Stoltzfus said only a few words before he  
was overcome with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lived a terrible life for a while. We want to try to be  
better,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcomer said he appreciated the men's cooperation with  
investigators -- they wore recording devices in their hats during 
discussions with Pagans motorcycle gang members. But the judge said 
he had to send a message about the severity of the men's actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the men purchased $100,000 worth of cocaine  
from members of the Pagans between 1992 and 1997, then sold the 
drugs at hoe-downs for the Crickets, the Antiques and the Pilgrims 
youth groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The men pleaded guilty to conspiracy to deliver cocaine and  
could have received up to four years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, seven people connected with the Pagans were  
sentenced, most to four or five years in prison, for their roles in 
the drug ring.

<HEADLINE> Boy Scout Finds Missing Girls Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAR VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- Two girls who got lost on a trip near  
a Sierra Nevada lake were found safe after spending the night in 
the rugged wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve-year-old Mallory Smith and 8-year-old Rebecca Liberty  
slept on a rock and shared a sweatshirt for warmth as Monday's 
overnight temperatures dipped into the 40s. Mallory was only 
wearing a bathing suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Tuesday, the girls spotted a Boy Scout and asked him for  
directions. Thomas Ferrey realized the pair were the girls reported 
missing and led them to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Tired, hungry and bitten by mosquitos, the girls were otherwise  
in good shape. They were four miles from where they were last seen 
Monday afternoon while on a fishing trip with Rebecca's father. 
</P>
<P>
	Mallory's mother greeted her daughter with open arms.  
</P>
<P>
	``Her mom was in tears, scolding her but at the same time  
rejoicing and counting her blessings,'' Ferrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls became lost while playing a game of hide-and-seek as  
they headed back from Lake Alpine to get gum from the family car. 
Mallory said she knew they would be found because they heard 
helicopters overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls drank lake water and ate chips and crackers from a  
food bag they found hoisted in a tree. The bag had been placed 
there by the Boy Scout troop to keep bears away.

<HEADLINE> New Trial in Pa. Radiation Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- When cancer victims and their families won  
$36.5 million in a trial against uranium plant operators, their 
lawyers called it the biggest verdict involving radiation exposure 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they have to try it all over again.  
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Donetta Ambrose on Tuesday ordered a new  
trial, ruling that some testimony was prejudicial and evidence was 
improperly withheld from lawyers for the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Apollo, about 25 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, say  
they inhaled white radioactive dust from the plant for three 
decades. The dust contained uranium that caused an unusually high 
cancer rate, they claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant shut down in 1986, and residents sued in 1994.  
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for plant operators Atlantic Richfield Co. and Babcock  
and Wilcox Co. argued that no one could prove a medical link 
between radiation and the cancers. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury disagreed last September and ordered the companies to pay  
$36.5 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambrose said evidence including testimony from scientists who  
linked violations of federal emissions standards to the cancers was 
``highly prejudicial and often irrelevant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ambrose, who presided over the original trial, said she agreed  
with arguments from company attorneys that no juror could ``remain 
unaffected by that evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also said scientific evidence obtained by the families  
should have been shared with the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried it the first time and we won, and we'll try it the  
second time and we'll win,'' said Fred Baron, attorney for the 
families.

<HEADLINE> Hubbell Pleads Guilty in Starr Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Longtime presidential friend Webster Hubbell  
pleaded guilty today to concealing his and first lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton's legal work on a fraudulent land deal back in 
Arkansas. Prosecutors recommended no jail time or fine for the 
felony. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a deal with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr,  
prosecutors asked that Hubbell serve one year of probation. U.S. 
District Judge James Robertson will decide the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell also pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in a tax evasion  
case that revolved around payments he received from friends of the 
president in 1994 and 1995, while he was under investigation by 
Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked in court whether he would change his previous ``innocent''  
plea on failure to disclose facts to Whitewater investigators, a 
somber-looking Hubbell answered, ``I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former associate attorney general answered the tax charge  
with one word -- ``Guilty'' -- as his wife, Suzy, watched from the 
front row. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr sat at the prosecution table during the hearing that ended  
his nearly five years of investigation of Hubbell, who was formerly 
the No. 3 official at the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea halted plans for a trial next month that could have  
been embarrassing for Mrs. Clinton as she explores whether to run 
for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	And it finished two separate criminal cases brought last year  
against Hubbell, who already has served 16 months in prison for an 
earlier guilty plea in Starr's probe. 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, Hubbell was accused of covering up his and Mrs.  
Clinton's legal work on a 1,050-acre land development south of 
Little Rock owned by Mrs. Clinton's Whitewater partner, Jim 
McDougal, and Hubbell's father-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	The land deal -- which federal regulators said was riddled with  
sham transactions -- cost the failing savings and loan owned by the 
Clintons' Whitewater partner $3.8 million and contributed to the 
insolvency of the institution. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax indictment, Hubbell was accused of failing to declare  
as income $74,000 of more than $450,000 in fees from 15 employers 
in 1994, when top Clinton advisers arranged consulting contracts 
for the former associate attorney general from Vernon Jordan and 
other close friends of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment said Hubbell paid only $30,000 in taxes for  
1989-92 and 1994-95, even though he earned more than $1 million 
from 1994 to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment said that by the end of 1997, Hubbell and his  
wife had liquidated about $1 million in assets and spent virtually 
all their money. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell had promised to fully cooperate with Starr's  
investigation when he 
</P>
<P>
	pleaded guilty in 1994 to stealing $400,000 from his Arkansas  
law firm and its clients. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hubbell's memory lapses about key events in the Whitewater  
saga slowed the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Two events renewed Starr's interest in Hubbell in 1996.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's law-firm billing records emerged under  
still-unexplained circumstances inside the White House, revealing 
her work and Hubbell's on the fraudulent land development south of 
Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	And Starr discovered the financial assistance to Hubbell  
arranged by the president's friends, which raised the specter of 
``hush money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question now is whether Hubbell has anything further to tell  
Starr's investigators about the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	While Hubbell will be subjected to questioning once again by  
Starr's office, the prosecutor may end up with little more from 
Hubbell than he had in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see anything Starr gets out of it except the windup of  
these proceedings and another notch in his belt,'' said George 
Washington University law professor Mary Cheh. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently released court records reveal that in his first round  
of cooperation with Starr's office in 1995, Hubbell gave the 
prosecutor damaging information about major figures in the 
Whitewater scandal, while providing little if anything useful to 
the prosecutor about his longtime friends.

<HEADLINE> Football Players May Be Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Investigators plan to ask county  
prosecutors next week for felony warrants charging two Michigan 
football players and a former teammate with embezzlement and 
conspiracy to commit embezzlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The trio and three others are being investigated by the  
sheriff's department after being accused of stealing merchandise 
from a Kmart store, Lt. Brenda Sutton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive linemen Jonathan Goodwin and Maurice Williams and  
former fullback Demetrius Smith were described as being part of a 
six-person embezzlement ring in 14th District Court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still in the investigation process,'' Sutton said. ``It's  
going to be up to the prosecutor's office to determine charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three men along with two women, with help from a female  
cashier, are accused of taking thousands of dollars worth of 
merchandise -- from cameras to comforters -- through a checkout lane 
at the store earlier this month, the court records show. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone charged and convicted could face a maximum penalty of 10  
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief assistant Washtenaw County prosecutor Joe Burke could not  
be reached by The Associated Press today, but declined comment to 
the Detroit Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin also declined to comment to the Free Press Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams said: ``I made a bad decision; no comment.''  
</P>
<P>
	Smith could not be reached, the paper said.  
</P>
<P>
	Michigan president Lee Bollinger said, ``I don't know the facts,  
and until I am fully briefed, I can't comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators searched an apartment where Goodwin and Williams  
live and recovered 52 items valued at more than $3,000, including 
telephones, furniture, video tapes and toilet paper. They also 
expect to search three other locations and recover another $3,000 
worth of merchandise, the Free Press said. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation began last Wednesday when a loss control  
manager for Kmart contacted the sheriff's department. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who was suspended during spring practice for violating  
team rules, pleaded guilty on June 8 to forging a check. He is 
scheduled for sentencing July 27, Washtenaw County Circuit Court 
records say.

<HEADLINE> Capitol Architect Hearing Canceled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Rules Committee canceled a hearing  
today on the Architect of the Capitol's management of congressional 
buildings and grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of the panel, was unable  
to convene the hearing because he was busy with legislation on the 
Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Architect of the Capitol Alan Hantman had been scheduled to  
testify after months of news stories about workplace health and 
safety problems, and questions about delays in a proposed 
congressional visitors' center. 
</P>
<P>
	The architect's office has been cited by a congressional  
enforcement agency with numerous workplace safety violations, 
including improper storage of dangerous chemicals and discovery of 
unacceptable levels of Legionnaire's bacteria in the Capitol's 
heating and cooling plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The architect's staff at one point had the highest accident rate  
of all federal agencies, government figures revealed, and the House 
inspector general has called the Capitol a firetrap with defective 
sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the early 1990s, the architect's office has been unable to  
get a successful recycling program under way -- although lack of 
cooperation from lawmakers has been partly to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	Hantman also is defending a number of employee grievance cases,  
many of them predating his assuming office. 
</P>
<P>
	Such issues raise the question of whether Congress is willing to  
abide by the health and safety rules it imposes on the rest of the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hantman has the difficult job of overseeing a $250 million  
budget and 2,000 employees, while balancing the competing goals of 
openness and security in congressional buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Appointed by President Clinton two years ago, the former chief  
architect at New York's Rockefeller Center has been accused of 
moving too slowly on the proposed $160 million visitors' center. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed facility was given impetus last summer when a  
gunman burst into the Capitol and killed two police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawmakers have questioned why the project has not moved  
along faster, although Hantman is handicapped by the inability of 
several congressional committees to reach a consensus on how to 
proceed.

	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Thirteen doctors have been charged with  
mail fraud for allegedly supplying false disability reports to 
General Motors Corp. and DaimlerChrysler AG employees. 
</P>
<P>
	A probe began after the General Motors National Benefits Center  
noticed a trend of fraudulent disability claims, according to FBI 
affidavits released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Undercover investigators from GM and Blue Cross Blue Shield  
visited the physicians, telling the doctors they needed to get off 
work but had no health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	One affidavit says Dr. Brian Grappin suggested a diagnosis of  
stress with headaches and a stiff neck for an investigator who 
wanted to go to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Grappin said the accusations were false.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every patient who comes in here gets an examination and  
chiropractic treatment,'' he said. ``Everything I did was based on 
what the patients tell me and my findings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors charged as little as $25 for a note covering a one-day  
absence, and up to $120 for a two-week leave, the affidavits 
alleged. 
</P>

	Company rules require autoworkers to get a doctor's excuse to be  
paid for time off due to illness.

<HEADLINE> Medicare HMOs Changing Coverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- About 200,000 Medicare HMO recipients will be  
forced to change health plans next year and millions of additional 
seniors will face higher rates for fewer benefits as HMOs complain 
that government reimbursements no longer are keeping up with their 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	PacifiCare Health Systems, Humana and Foundation Health Systems  
-- three of the nation's biggest Medicare health maintenance 
organizations -- said Wednesday they will stop covering Medicare 
members in several markets. 
</P>
<P>
	CIGNA and several regional HMOs previously said they will  
withdraw from a number of Medicare markets on Jan. 1, 2000, while 
Aetna and United Healthcare are expected to join the trend on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the HMOs said they expect to raise premiums and  
reduce some benefits on many of their remaining members as a way to 
make staying in the program financially viable. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the HMOs complain the government is cutting back,  
Medicare officials say payments continue to grow, but at a slower 
rate in some markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Studies continue to show that Medicare managed care plans are  
still being overpaid,'' said Nancy Ann DeParle, administrator of 
the Health Care Financing Administration which oversees Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The health plans were required to notify the federal government  
by Thursday of any changes to their Medicare HMO operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems virtually every Medicare (HMO) beneficiary will be  
affected by some type of cutback,'' said Karen Ignagni, president 
of the American Association of Health Plans, an HMO trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare HMO members will receive notices in the next several  
days if their plan is withdrawing from Medicare, and they will 
either have to choose another health plan -- if one is available -- 
or choose traditional Medicare. Members will be notified of precise 
benefit changes and premium increases in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Humana, for example, said some of its members will no longer get  
coverage for any prescription drugs other than generics. Some 
Humana members also will have to pay part of the cost of outpatient 
hospital care. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6.2 million of the 39 million Medicare enrollees now get  
health insurance coverage through an HMO. Seniors have signed up 
with HMOs as an alternative to Medicare's traditional 
fee-for-service coverage because the HMOs offer them prescription 
drug coverage and fewer co-payments. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton on Tuesday unveiled his plan to offer a  
prescription drug program for traditional Medicare, though 
Republican opposition is likely to hurt its chances for passage. 
</P>
<P>
	In many retirement areas such as South Florida and Arizona,  
federal reimbursement for HMOs had been so high the plans did not 
charge seniors a premium. 
</P>
<P>
	But HMO officials say that's about to change.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, about 400,000 Medicare recipients in more than 30  
states had to change health plans when more than 100 HMOs opted 
against renewing Medicare contracts after the federal government 
cut the growth in the reimbursement rate. Until then, Medicare had 
been seen as the most lucrative market for HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Medicare payment changes, part of the 1997 balanced-budget  
law, were made in response to reports that Medicare was overpaying 
the health plans. 
</P>
<P>
	While fewer Medicare recipients will have to change health plans  
in 2000 compared to 1999, industry officials say the situation is 
worse because so many Medicare HMO members will face higher 
premiums, Ignagni said. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles-based Foundation, one of California's biggest health  
insurers, said it will drop about 5 percent of its 283,000 Medicare 
enrollees in 2000. The company said it's planning to drop Medicare 
coverage in parts of several states where it operates. It refused 
to disclose specific details. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Hartford-based CIGNA said it would drop coverage of  
about 10,000 Medicare beneficiaries next year or about 5 percent of 
its Medicare members. CIGNA is leaving six markets: Little Rock, 
Ark., Cleveland, Kansas City, Kan., Philadelphia and southern New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisville, Ky.-based Humana said Wednesday it will withdraw its  
Medicare HMO from the following markets: Tucson, Ariz., Las Vegas, 
Dallas, Kansas City, Kan., Austin, Texas, Milwaukee, Wis. and 
Melbourne, Fla. Humana also plans to exit parts of the San Antonio 
and Houston markets. As a result, about 46,000 of Humana's 480,000 
Medicare HMO members will be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	``When government reimbursement of care for seniors in Medicare  
Choice plans is no longer adequate to cover the cost of quality 
care, we have no choice but to discontinue the product,'' said 
Gregory H. Wolf, Humana's president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Santa Ana, Calif.-based PacifiCare said Wednesday it is pulling  
its Medicare plan out of several markets including: Dayton, Ohio, 
Medford, Ore., McMinnville Ore., Spokane, Wash. and central 
California. The move will affect 16,400 of its 991,000 Medicare HMO 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Arizona said it plans to quit  
covering Medicare members in that state, forcing 13,000 of its 
members to find another insurance option.

<HEADLINE> Jones, Johnson Win at Bislett Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Three women set world seasonal bests at the  
Bislett Games on Wednesday, but track and field's biggest female 
star was not among them. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion Jones began her quest for the $1 million Golden League  
jackpot winning the 200 meters in a time of 22.13 seconds. The 
American led all the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was rather chilly, but the conditions were the same for  
everybody,'' Jones said. ``We just came to Europe after our trials, 
so I'm satisfied with my win and time. The race for the jackpot 
started well. It was my first 200 on this track and it was OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden League comprises the most important one-day meetings  
in Oslo, Rome, Monaco, Zurich, Brussels, Berlin and Paris. A $1 
million jackpot will be shared among those athletes who win Golden 
League events in all seven meets. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones won both her previous 100-meter races at Bislett, one of  
the sport's most storied venues where 51 world records have been 
broken since 1924. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 200 is her favorite distance. She had a winning time of  
22.10 in the USA Championships last week, .29 off her seasonal 
best. Last year, she ran a 21.62, the second fastest time in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Beverly McDonald of Jamaica was runnerup Wednesday in 22.51 and  
third went to Zhanna Pintusevich-Block of Ukraine in 22.66. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's seasonal bests were set by Gabriela Szabo of Romania  
in the 3,000 meters, Tanja Damaske of Germany in the javelin and 
Deon Hemmings of Jamaica in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
	Szabo, one of the world's top middle and long-distance runners,  
was perhaps the most impressive as she won her race in 8:27.21. It 
was 11 seconds faster than her previous best this year and also a 
new Bislett Stadium record. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good, but not the best,'' Szabo said. ``I'm only at the  
beginning of the year. But I've had a very good training for this 
season, so my expectations are high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zahra Ouaziz of Morocco was second in 8:28.26 and Gete Wami of  
Ethiopia third in 8:29.83. 
</P>
<P>
	Damaske's best throw of 214 feet, 9 1/2 inches was also a new  
German record. Still, she wasn't very pleased with her series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any of my throws were ideal. I hope they will  
come in Spain in August,'' said Damaske, refering to the World 
Championships in Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	The women were competing with the new javelin.  
</P>
<P>
	``Today we had a wind which would have been better for the old  
javelin,'' Damaske said. ``The old jav could sail better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hemmings took the 400 in 53.48.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very good race for me,'' she said. ``I'm not even  
tired. To beat the world's best time (this year) here was beyond my 
expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Barmasai of Kenya clocked 8:06.15 in the 3,000  
steeplechase and Kenyan-born Wilson Kipketer won the 800 in 1:43.11 
for seasonal bests among the men. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not bad, but I have more in me,'' Barmasai said. ``The first  
pacemaker was good, the second was a problem. He didn't do 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kipketer, who set the 800 world record two years ago during a  
season when he also won his second world championship gold medal, 
is trying to come back after a bout with malaria that hurt him 
badly in last year's European Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``The king is back, but only almost,'' Kipketer said. ``It's  
still not perfect. I need to adjust some small things. I still 
can't train at 100 percent after my illness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	World champion Allen Johnson won the men's 110 meter hurdles in  
13.14, missing another world seasonal best by just .03. Fellow 
American Larry Wade, fastest this season, didn't compete. Johnson's 
time equaled the Bislett Stadium record he set two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time is OK,'' Johson said. ``This win shows to people who  
wrote me off that, after my injury problems, I'm back. I'm not 
dead. My strongest part was the finish and that's good. I'm happy 
that I equaled my stadium record. That's something special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florian Schwarthoff of Germany finished second in 13.22 and Mark  
Crear of the United States third in 13.31 in a race marred by two 
false starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia, the world's top long-distance  
runner, failed in an attempt to break the 5,000 record he set last 
year in Helsinki, Finland. He won the race, which did not count 
toward the Golden League, in 12:53.92. 
</P>
<P>
	It was more than 14 seconds off his world record, but the first  
sub-13 at Bislett. Said Aoutia of Morocco set the old Bislett mark 
of 13:00.40 in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was rather cool and windy, so we changed our plan,''  
Gebrselassie said. ``The pacemakers were OK. We didn't run fast 
enough for two or three laps. But it's something special to run a 
sub-13 as first ever on this track.''

<HEADLINE> Kaye Ballard Has No Plans To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kaye Ballard remembers the time she worked with  
comedian Lenny Bruce at the Crescendo in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the only comedian he ever wrote for,'' she said. ``At the  
time, I was doing a lot of comedy routines. I said, `Lenny, I need 
a number.' He took the laundry cardboard out of one of his shirts 
and wrote me a satire on 'Autumn Leaves.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard liked it so much, she put it on an album.  
</P>
<P>
	``I got a check for 14 cents,'' she said. ``The album didn't  
sell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard is best known as a comedian and for her role as Kaye  
Buell in the '60s television series ``The Mothers-in-Law.'' During 
her long and successful career, she has been on Broadway, performed 
one-woman shows, made movies and recordings, and appeared in guest 
spots on television, including more than 150 appearances on the 
``Tonight'' show. 
</P>
<P>
	She is currently playing a loving grandmother in the  
off-Broadway production of ``Over the River and Through the Woods'' 
at the John Houseman Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud that I'm 72 and I learned this grandmother part in  
eight days,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard keeps a picture of her grandmother on her dressing  
table. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing my own grandmother in the show. .... My mother's  
mother. She was the most important person in my life. It's a 
pleasure to do this. At the end of it, I feel like I'm her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Joe DiPietro's warmly sentimental comedy, a young man makes a  
weekly trip from Manhattan to Hoboken, N.J., to visit his four 
Italian grandparents. The young man's dilemma: He wants to accept a 
job transfer to Seattle, but feels guilty about leaving his 
relatives, who don't want him to move away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am an Italian woman,'' said Ballard, who was born Catherine  
Gloria Balotta. ``This part is like wearing a second skin. I just 
would love to re-create it in a movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if someone decided to make ``Over the River'' into a film,  
she would like Martin Scorsese to direct. Ballard said Scorsese 
would see his own mother in the story. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, Ballard was performing with veteran singer-dancer  
Ann Miller in ``Follies'' at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, 
N.J. Miller barreled through ``I'm Still Here,'' an anthem to 
show-biz durability of herself -- and Ballard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got to sing `Broadway Baby,''' Ballard said. ``It was such a  
thrill, every minute of it. Ann Miller was so cute. `I'm here, I'm 
here,' she'd warm up her voice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``The Mothers-in-Law,'' which ran from 1967 to 1969,  
Ballard's character and her husband were unconventional next-door 
neighbors to Eve Arden and her character's husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still get mail from all over from that show,'' she said.  
``It made such an impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She began her career in her native Cleveland, playing tuba and  
flute in Spike Jones' band, which did a lot of musical parodies. 
``He was responsible for helping me find myself in the way of 
comedy and ideas,'' she said. ``He was brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
	``From him I went into musical comedy: `Three to Make Ready'  
with Ray Bolger, a month on Broadway and on tour 10 months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard introduced the song ``Lazy Afternoon'' in ``The Golden  
Apple'' on Broadway in 1954. She also appeared in the Broadway 
production of ``The Pirates of Penzance'' in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love musical comedy better than anything,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	When she's not working, Ballard relaxes at her home in Rancho  
Mirage, near Palm Springs, Calif. ``I bought Desi Arnaz's little 
house, one smart move I made in show business. I enjoy my house 
immensely. I spent so much money on apartments. I always had a 
beautiful apartment and I'd go on the road to pay for it. I never 
enjoyed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What about retirement?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to retire. I don't believe in retiring. I do  
take more time off now to enjoy life and my three dogs and house. 
But if something wonderful comes up, I'm ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She never married. ``I didn't want to,'' she said. ``I could  
have, many times. But I just wanted a career too much. I was smart 
enough to know, if you get married and have children, that's it. 
Being Italian and raised as a Catholic, I took children seriously. 
Maybe I made a mistake. Who knows?''

<HEADLINE> Theater in Kenya Struggles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Tony Njuguna, one of Kenya's most famous  
actors, was meeting his public -- schoolgirls in green pleated 
skirts. But it wasn't his performance that night in ``Bedside 
Manners'' or his distinguished acting career that had them 
squealing. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his toothpaste commercials.  
</P>
<P>
	``Crest!'' the schoolgirls screamed, mobbing Njuguna in the  
theater lobby one recent Friday night as though he was Brad Pitt or 
Tom Cruise. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike Pitt, Cruise and other American stars, acting is  
neither easy nor is it a full-time job in Kenya, even for the 
handful of well-known stars like Njuguna. 
</P>
<P>
	Njuguna is one of the few nationally known faces here, and  
that's only because of his work on TV commercials. The other stars 
of ``Bedside Manners,'' a farce written by Briton Derek Benfield 
about two pairs of unfaithful spouses who end up in the same hotel, 
work during the day as travel agents and advertising consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	Locally made theater, television and film are nearly nonexistent  
in Kenya, where movie theaters show year-old American and Indian 
films and television is filled with professional wrestling, 
evangelical preachers and episodes of ``The Bold and the 
Beautiful'' from the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	With no drama schools, no college acting programs, not a dime of  
government funding and no tradition of private donations for the 
arts, theater in Kenya is limping along. 
</P>
<P>
	Performance halls built by British colonialists have been looted  
or made into parking lots, and white theater troupes have slowly 
disbanded since Kenya gained independence in 1963 and whites began 
trickling from the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phoenix Players, the country's only full-time theater group,  
performs ``Bedside Manners'' at the Professional Centre in what 
looks like an American high school auditorium or an 
off-off-Broadway space at best. Its 120 vinyl-backed chairs are 
crammed into a basement with busted lights. Little signs are taped 
to the flimsy sets to make sure the audience understands what they 
are. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like when people are little they play the good fairy  
and say, `Mummy, I want to be an actor when I grow up,''' said 
James Falkland, a British-born Kenyan actor and director who 
co-founded the Phoenix in 1983. ``What's the point of having a 
drama school if there's no industry for them to go into?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the fat lady hasn't sung yet. With the demise of the  
European-run theaters, many see the beginning of something new and 
truly Kenyan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenyan society is slowly opening up. In 1992, the country  
revived its multiparty political system, and the following year 
tossed out a colonial-era law requiring artists to have a 
government license to show their work. 
</P>
<P>
	Slowly, Kenyan actors are surfacing.  
</P>
<P>
	On weekends, actors have started putting on little plays in  
small hotels, restaurants and bars on the outskirts of Nairobi, 
shoving aside tables and chairs to make a stage. The plays touch on 
issues like government corruption and AIDS, and are frequently 
ribald. All this would have been highly risky less than a decade 
ago under government censorship. 
</P>
<P>
	The playlets are frequently in the Kikuyu language -- a notable  
change since performances in local languages were particularly 
censored under colonial rulers and then under the single-party rule 
of the Kenyan African National Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the British and KANU leaders were more tolerant of  
performances in English and Swahili, assuming the well-educated 
audiences were already accustomed to dissident art and were too 
small to launch a rebellion. It was the masses they were worried 
about. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past few years, small theater troupes have been founded  
for the first time. But even the best-known, like the Nyungu 
Cultural Club and the Mhalamwezi Players. perform to very small 
audiences, and just about everyone in the room is Kenyan. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 Kenyans recently turned out at the Nyungu club for a  
one-man show about different versions of the Creation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in the crowd of mostly well-dressed yuppies laughed and  
others nodded off as the performer danced, drummed and spoke in 
Swahili and English about how progress has brought human beings no 
closer to knowing why they were created. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilda Obyerodhyambo, who runs the troupe, said it will take a  
major shift in Kenya's cultural mindset for theater to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	For most of the hundreds of thousands of people who have  
migrated to the city from rural Kenya since independence, she said, 
performance was something informal that just broke out in public 
spaces and at family get-togethers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Africans aren't accustomed to paying for performance'' or art,  
she said. ``People say, `Why should I pay $230 for that painting? 
Why don't you just give it to me?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Falkland says he's been predicting this theater drought since he  
came to Kenya in 1970, and that white troupe leaders refused to 
invest in locals. They didn't think it was possible, he said, for 
Kenyans to put on a production like ``Bedside Manners,'' which was 
performed by an all-Kenyan cast. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you suggested this 10 years ago at a muzungu cocktail party  
they would have laughed at you,'' he said. Muzungu is Swahili for 
white person. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenyans are being exposed to all kinds of performance art and  
there's no reason they should be limited to doing tribal dances 
outside mud huts, Falkland said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Culture is not a static thing. It keeps changing to suit the  
society as it changes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Growing Kenyan theater is important to young people, at least to  
more than 200 of them who showed up at the Professional Centre over 
a recent weekend to try out for a few spots in the Phoenix's fall 
production of ``Cinderella.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among them was Saaqut Wagana.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to do something from the inside,'' the 24-year-old  
said, making a motion with his hands of something coming up from 
the depths of his gut. ``For me, it's do or die.''

<HEADLINE> `Miss Saigon' To Close in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The producer of ``Miss Saigon'' said Wednesday the  
blockbuster musical will close in London on Oct. 30, a decade after 
it opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Producer Cameron Mackintosh called the closing ``entirely  
sweet'' and said: ``For the most serious of all musicals, this is a 
great achievement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said recent audiences have fallen to about 60 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were starting to see its time in London was coming to a  
natural end,'' Mackintosh said. 
</P>
<P>
	The show is still running on Broadway, where it will celebrate  
its 10th birthday in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Set during the Vietnam War, ``Miss Saigon'' is the story of a  
tragic affair between a young Vietnamese girl and an American 
soldier at the time of the fall of Saigon in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Since it opened, the London ``Saigon'' has taken in more than  
$250 million and made an estimated $35 million in profits. That 
places it after ``Cats'' and ``Les Miserables'' as the third most 
profitable musical in British theater history.

<HEADLINE>  Turks Celebrate Ocalan Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Turks celebrated the death sentence  
given Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan with displays of 
nationalist fervor Wednesday, even as some analysts questioned 
whether hanging Ocalan would truly be in Turkey's best interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan's rebels have threatened to increase attacks if their  
leader is sent to the gallows, and European countries are warning 
that an execution could seriously hamper Turkey's already troubled 
bid to become a full member of the European Union. The 15-nation EU 
opposes the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is hanging Ocalan necessary and to the benefit of Turkey?''  
asked Oktay Eksi, chief columnist for the prominent Hurriyet daily. 
``It is our duty to seek the answer of this question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What is the use of saying blood for blood?'' wrote another  
columnist, Perihan Magden, in the Radikal newspaper. ``The 
important thing is not to go after cheap revenge ... not to lose 
more lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was violence in the largely Kurdish southeast on the day  
of the sentencing Tuesday. Soldiers killed 12 Kurdish guerrillas in 
a clash on the slopes of Mount Havillati in southeastern Hakkari 
province, the Anatolia news agency reported Wednesday. It gave no 
other details. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebels of Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party launched a pair of  
rockets overnight at police housing and the municipal building in 
the southeastern town of Idil, officials said. The rockets exploded 
in the air. No injuries or damage were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	PKK militants also firebombed Turkish businesses and other  
establishments across Germany early Wednesday. One person was 
injured in Stuttgart. More than 2 million Turks live in Germany, 
and about one-quarter are Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, the self-proclaimed Kurdish parliament-in-exile  
warned Turkey to expect more violence if the death sentence is 
carried out. The parliament is made up of 65 Kurds -- mostly from 
Turkey -- who live in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two peoples have nothing to gain from a new war, which  
risks being more violent than ever,'' said Yasar Kaya, head of the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	There is enormous pressure in Turkey to hang the man blamed for  
37,000 deaths in 15 years of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Turks believe that Ocalan's death would be the final blow  
to his Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, and would bring peace to 
the devastated southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 men, apparently Turkish soldiers in civilian clothes,  
marched through the streets of Diyarbakir, the largest city in the 
southeast, chanting ``Imrali will be Ocalan's grave.'' Imrali is 
the prison island where Ocalan stood trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents silently watched the flag-waving demonstrators.  
</P>
<P>
	The Sabah newspaper printed a picture of a hangman's noose on  
its front page Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want that man who slaughtered numerous people hanged  
immediately,'' said taxi driver Huseyin Tutun. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be months before that happens. The death penalty must  
still be approved by parliament and President Suleyman Demirel. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, which holds the presidency of the EU, led a chorus of  
appeals on Tuesday from European countries for Turkey to let Ocalan 
live. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.N. official also appealed to Turkey to refrain from carrying  
out the death sentence, citing legal ``irregularities'' in the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, U.N. special  
investigator on executions Asma Jahangir said Ocalan was held 
incommunicado for ten days, his access to legal counsel was 
severely limited, and his lawyers were harassed and threatened 
before the rebel leader was convicted and sentenced for treason. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan's lawyers said they would apply to the Strasbourg-based  
European Court of Human Rights to prevent the execution.

severely limited, and his lawyers were harassed and threatened 
before the rebel leader was convicted and sentenced for treason. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan's lawyers said they would apply to the Strasbourg-based  
European Court of Human Rights to prevent the execution.

<HEADLINE> Census: U.S. Cities Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Like thousands of other transplants from the  
Midwest, Mark Janousek moved here from Minnesota to escape the 
snow. He found plentiful sunshine, and he also found plenty of 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people drive much, much too fast and follow too close.  
There's too many tailgaters -- I'd never seen that before,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aggressive drivers on congested highways are just two byproducts  
from Phoenix's explosive expansion in the 1990s -- a population 
surge that made the city the nation's fastest growing. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Census Bureau reported Tuesday that Phoenix's  
population increased 21.3 percent between 1990 and 1998 to 
1,198,064. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio was second among cities of 1 million people or more,  
with an increase of 14.1 percent to 1,114,130 over the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego (9.9 percent, 1,220,666), Houston (8.0 percent,  
1,786,691) and Dallas (6.8 percent, 1,075,894) rounded out the top 
five among major cities. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Census Bureau said the fastest growing category was  
cities with populations between 10,000 and 50,000, which grew 8.6 
percent overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Mesquite, Nev., rocketed 441.2 percent to 10,125 people, and  
Frisco, Texas, grew 328.5 percent to 26,304. Of course, a few new 
folks can make a relatively dramatic difference in smaller cities. 
A city of 1 million, by contrast, would have to grow by 86,000 
people to show an 8.6 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the new estimates, New York remained the nation's  
most populous city, with 7.4 million people, followed by Los 
Angeles, with 3.6 million. Phoenix became the nation's seventh most 
populous city in 1998, climbing from ninth in 1990. San Antonio 
rose from 10th to eighth place. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that Phoenix was tops in population growth doesn't  
surprise residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you have do is look around Phoenix to see that we have  
been growing quickly,'' said Sandy Bahr, spokeswoman for the Sierra 
Club in Phoenix. ``But we haven't planned that growth very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the decade, the massive growth has reshaped the look of  
the city, with new factories, highways, houses, office buildings, 
schools, shopping centers and sports stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy has become much more diversified,'' said Ferrell  
Quinlan, spokesman for the Arizona Chamber of Commerce. ``We have a 
lot of high-tech, high-paying jobs that have brought wealth in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio officials say they have also diversified beyond a  
traditional reliance on the military. The city has developed a 
vibrant medical and biomedical economy and increased its tourism 
and convention business. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're seeing is the payoff from the transformation of  
this city's economy over the last 25 years,'' said Joe Krier, 
president of the Greater San Antonio Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix's growth this decade continues a pattern from the 1970s  
and '80s, driven in part by retirees looking for warmer days and 
blue-collar workers fleeing declining industries in the rust-belt 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	But cheap housing and land in the early 1990s and an influx of  
California transplants helped launch the current boom, Quinlan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For Phoenix officials, the go-go growth has been a cultural and  
recreational boon. The city added major-league hockey and baseball 
teams this decade to the football and basketball clubs it already 
had. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bahr and others say there is a clear downside to the influx  
of more than 200,000 newcomers in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	More people means more cars and longer commutes, more accidents  
and higher insurance rates. A transportation research group ranked 
Phoenix third among large metro areas for traffic deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	More people means more pollution from lawn mowers, cars and  
factories. The city could lose federal highway funding if it 
doesn't improve its air quality, especially during the winter 
months when brown smog shrouds Phoenix and increases respiratory 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	More people also means overcrowded schools, more stress on the  
city's social services and more crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our quality of life has suffered because of this very rapid,  
unplanned growth,'' said Bahr, whose group is involved in a 
petition drive to create controls on growth.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Select Duke's Brand No. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Chicago Bulls decided to keep their No. 1  
draft pick Wednesday night and selected Elton Brand, the college 
player of the year who left Duke after his sophomore season. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, a 6-foot-8 forward, was chosen after the Bulls took a  
serious last look at Rhode Island's Lamar Odom, bringing him into 
Chicago for a workout on the eve of the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, though, Bulls general manager Jerry Krause went with  
the safer of the two picks, choosing to try to rebuild his dynasty 
with a solid frontcourt player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know where I was going to fit in this draft. I did  
want to be the No. 1 pick,'' Brand said. ``I feel I am the best 
player and I can improve a lot. I think I can be the cornerstone in 
their rebuilding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he knew he would be the No. 1 overall pick, Brand said:  
``Not at all. I didn't have the slightest idea. I feel blessed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, 20, was the first player ever to leave Duke as an  
underclassman. He averaged 16.2 points and 9.8 rebounds in his 
final season there, leading the Blue Devils into the NCAA 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand became the first player from Duke ever selected first  
overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just an outstanding person,'' Krause said. ``It was a  
very tough decision. We just came to a decision that we think Elton 
Brand is an outstanding player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vancouver Grizzlies selected second and chose guard Steve  
Francis, who had indicated he would be less than enthralled to play 
in Canada. Francis kept his head buried in his hands as his name 
was announced, then raised his arms in the air to a loud ovation as 
he walked onstage to meet commissioner David Stern. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis played in college at nearby Maryland, averaging 17.0  
points in his only season for the Terrapins. Francis, 22, was a 
first-team All-ACC selection last season and was widely considered 
one of the most exciting college players to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	A shooting guard in college who was expected to be a point guard  
in the pros, Francis might play alongside point guard Mike Bibby 
with the Grizzlies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, when I wake up tomorrow, I'll be happy,'' said  
Francis, who has never been to Canada. ``I feel relieved now more 
than happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA guard Baron Davis was taken third by the Charlotte Hornets,  
who had said they would grab him if he was still available. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, 20, left the Bruins after a sophomore season in which he  
averaged 15.9 points and 5.1 assists while still recovering from a 
torn anterior cruciate ligament suffered during the 1998 NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis had said prior to the draft that he would prefer to play  
for the Los Angeles Clippers, who selected fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	The drafting of Davis is expected to speed up the Hornets'  
efforts to trade veteran point guard David Wesley. Charlotte also 
has been trying to deal one of its power forwards, Derrick Coleman 
or Anthony Mason. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of getting Davis, the Clippers landed Odom, the  
6-foot-10 phenom who so intrigued Krause. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old Odom had one of the most bizarre pre-draft  
existences of anyone, making himself eligible, hiring and then 
firing an agent, trying to get reinstated at Rhode Island and then 
missing a pre-draft physical before NBA scouts in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Those were only the latest travails involving Odom, who attended  
three high schools during his senior season and planned to enroll 
at UNLV before the validity of his entrance exam scores were 
brought into question. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some decisions I made may not have been the best at that  
time,'' Odom said. ``I'm 19 years old. I'm thankful I didn't make 
those mistakes when I'm 29 and it's too late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Rhode Island, he averaged 17.6 points, 9.4 rebounds and 3.7  
assists -- numbers that had many player personnel directors calling 
him the most talented all-around player available. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom's thoughts on joining the Clippers, the league's perennial  
doormat: ``When the Bulls got Michael Jordan, they weren't the best 
team in the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto, selecting fifth, took high school center Jonathan  
Bender of Picayune, Miss., a rail-thin, 205-pounder who scored 31 
points in the McDonald's All-American game, breaking Michael 
Jordan's record by one. 
</P>
<P>
	Bender, 6-foot-10, was chosen higher than any high school  
entrant since Kevin Garnett, who went fifth overall to Minnesota in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Wally Szczerbiak went sixth to the Minnesota Timberwolves,  
becoming the first senior selected in this draft. In 1997 and 1998, 
seniors were the top picks overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak, 22, a 6-7 small forward with NBA 3-point range and a  
strong all-around game, is one of three collegians who have been 
added to the U.S. national team that will compete in July for a 
qualifying berth in the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The others are Brand and Richard Hamilton, a shooting guard from  
Connecticut who was chosen seventh by the Washington Wizards -- much 
to the delight of the hometown crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, 21, left Connecticut after a junior season in which he  
averaged 21.5 points and led the Huskies to the national title. He 
could move right into the starting lineup if the Wizards lose Mitch 
Richmond to free agency. Richmond is said to be pondering a return 
to his original NBA team, the Golden State Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Cavaliers, who coveted Szczerbiak, had to settle  
for Utah point guard Andre Miller, a member of the first-team 
All-America team. The 23-year-old, who also completed four years of 
college, averaged 15.8 points and 5.6 assists for the Utes last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	He is Utah's career leader in steals and led the Utes to the  
NCAA championship game in a junior season in which he shot 55 
percent from the field -- a very high percentage for a point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Marion, a 6-7 forward from UNLV, went ninth overall to the  
Phoenix Suns, who acquired the pick from Dallas a year ago in the 
Steve Nash trade. Marion, who averaged 23.5 points for the Runnin' 
Rebels, left college after his junior year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Hawks selected Arizona point guard Jason Terry with  
the 10th pick, quickly filling the vacancy left by the trade of 
Mookie Blaylock to Golden State on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2 Terry averaged 21.9 points and 5.5 assists for the  
Wildcats, earning a first-team All-America selection. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland used its second first-round pick, 11th overall, to  
take Duke senior Trajan Langdon, a 6-foot-3 shooting guard 
originally from Anchorage, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	Langdon was the second member of the Blue Devils to be picked  
the first round, and Duke -- which also lost William Avery and Corey 
Maggette -- had a good chance to become the first school with four 
first-rounders selected in the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raptors selected center Aleksandar Radojevic 12th overall,  
taking a chance on a 7-foot-3 giant from Montenegro who has been 
playing basketball for only a few years.

	RATING ICE CREAM: Consumer Reports readers are used to seeing  
the magazine give its Best Buy label to VCRs, vacuum cleaners, lawn 
mowers and the like. But in its July issue, three kinds of ice 
cream -- Breyers vanilla and coffee ice cream and ShopRite's Premium 
vanilla -- win the rating. Best Buy indicates a product high in 
overall quality and relatively low in price. The magazine tested 18 
kinds of vanilla ice cream, 17 kinds of chocolate, and six kinds of 
coffee. Haagen-Dazs got highest overall ratings for flavor and 
texture, but Consumer Reports noted that budget-conscious consumers 
could save a lot of money by going for store brands. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	STRINGS ATTACHED: If your idea of the perfect business is one  
that could combine a Beethoven sonata and the Internet, Inc. 
magazine may have what you're looking for. The magazine, which each 
month features a business that's up for sale, describes a violin 
shop in the mid-Atlantic region in its July issue. The business 
includes a 2,200-square-foot store, about 30 different models of 
violins totaling about $350,000 and parts to assemble violas and 
cellos. Now, if the idea of actually assembling a violin makes you 
say, ``I could never do that,'' there is nothing to fear. Inc. says 
the two skilled owners of the store, who are moving on to other 
opportunities, are willing to help teach a budding entrepreneur how 
to build a violin. If this is too low-tech for you, the shop also 
has a sophisticated computer system to help you track sales trends 
and inventory.

	ANOTHER CLICHE, AND YOUR JOB, BITE THE DUST: The pink slip, the  
decades-old symbol that an employee's services will no longer be 
required, may be passe, according to Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, 
an employment consulting firm. Challenger Gray reports that a 
growing number of companies are notifying workers by e-mail that 
they're being laid off, including an Oklahoma firm that did a mass 
e-mailing to 1,450 employees last week. Challenger Gray theorizes 
that companies may take this approach because it's easier to 
deliver bad news electronically, than face-to-face or by telephone.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Regina Carter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Regina Carter has this way of catching  
first-time listeners by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing on the bandstand during a recent gig at New York's  
Sweet Basil jazz club is this petite, 5-foot-4-inch woman, her hair 
in dreadlocks, carrying a violin. Those expecting some lighter, 
smooth jazz fare are about to find themselves on a thrilling roller 
coaster ride. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter tucks her violin under her chin and launches into the  
Gershwins' ``Oh, Lady, Be Good!'' -- the choruses rolling off at 
ever faster tempos, her phrases twisting and turning. When she 
finally puts down her instrument, the packed house erupts in 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter is the heir apparent to a select club of jazz violinists  
going back to Eddie South and Stuff Smith in the Swing Era, through 
Stephane Grappelli and on to the more contemporary Jean-Luc Ponty 
and John Blake. Carter said she is ``relating to that tradition ... 
and hopefully can take the music forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old Detroit native has been playing violin since she  
was 4, when she began studying the Suzuki method. She had a 
thorough classical training and was preparing to play in a symphony 
orchestra when she shocked her family and teachers by switching to 
jazz. After two years at the New England Conservatory, she 
transferred to Oakland University in Michigan to concentrate on 
jazz studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter moved to New York in 1991. The gigs eventually followed:  
a slot in the avant-garde String Trio of New York; straight-ahead 
jazz dates as a sideperson with pianist Kenny Barron and trombonist 
Steve Turre; appearances on ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' backing up 
guest singers such as Billy Joel and Dolly Parton; and session work 
on pop albums, including the multiplatinum ``The Miseducation of 
Lauryn Hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her first two albums for Atlantic were in an electric, smooth  
jazz vein and only hinted at her potential. But she began to be 
taken more seriously after show-stealing appearances with Wynton 
Marsalis' Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Blood on the Fields'' project 
and Cassandra Wilson's ``Traveling Miles'' recording and concerts 
honoring Miles Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Downbeat magazine put her on the cover of its June issue,  
hailing her as one of the rising young jazz stars. Her talents are 
fully displayed on her new -- mostly acoustic -- album ``Rhythms of 
the Heart'' (Verve). The album reflects her eclectic musical tastes 
-- a mix of African, Afro-Cuban and bossa nova tunes, as well as 
swing, bebop and even Motown (the Temptations' ``Papa Was a Rollin' 
Stone,'' reinterpreted here by Cassandra Wilson). Just before going 
out with her quintet on a tour of U.S. and European jazz festivals, 
Carter was interviewed at her record company's offices. 
</P>
<P>
	1. What inspired you to switch from classical to jazz violin?  
</P>
<P>
	Carter: I think I really decided in high school after I saw this  
concert with Stephane Grappelli. When he started to play, it was 
like this transformation happened, and it seemed like he was so 
incredibly happy. ... I just wanted to feel that buzz. ... It was 
the freedom to it as well -- to not have to play it this way because 
somebody says it, to be able to play how you feel that day and be 
able to improvise. ... I came home that day and said, `I'm playing 
jazz.' And my mother said, `No you're not. They don't make any 
money. They don't have any pension, health insurance.' 
</P>
<P>
	In high school, my quartet had a master class with Yehudi  
Menuhin. My teacher said to him, `Oh, she wants to ruin her career 
and play jazz.' And Yehudi said, `Oh, leave her alone.' And he did 
this little jazz lick on his violin to let us know he'd been 
dabbling in it as well. 
</P>
<P>
	I decided to completely make the switch in my second year in  
college. I got a lot of negative response. ... But it was such a 
great passion that I knew I was going to be OK with it. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Why do you think jazz violinists are so few and far between?  
</P>
<P>
	Carter: People have this preconceived notion that jazz isn't  
jazz if you don't have a horn player. That's the first 
misconception. And then people have a misconception about how the 
violin is going to sound, and people think that it can't swing. 
People look at the violin and think that it's not an instrument 
that necessarily belongs in jazz. ... Where it really has a whole 
history that goes back to the big band era. 
</P>
<P>
	I'm trying to get people to see the history of jazz violinists  
and then hopefully accept the instrument as part of the idiom. ... 
The violin can be anything. I can play it as a percussion 
instrument. I can get a lot of other sounds that other instruments 
can. It's a fiery instrument. It's a soulful, swinging instrument. 
It's got passion from one end to the other. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Do you have a particular favorite jazz violinist? Classical  
violinist? 
</P>
<P>
	Carter: My two favorite jazz violinists are Stuff Smith and  
Eddie South. They just both swing so hard. Stuff Smith for me is 
more gutsy and fiery and really digs into the instrument. Eddie 
South also swings hard, but he was a brilliant classical violinist 
and you can hear it in his playing. 
</P>
<P>
	I always have to say my favorite classical violinist is Itzhak  
Perlman. He was my first introduction to classical violin, and as a 
youngster I had master classes with him. His playing has always 
just been so full of passion and fire. ... He seems like such a 
genuine person and his music really reflects that. I think that a 
lot of people pretend to be something but their music will always 
tell the truth about them. 
</P>
<P>
	4. What do you think your album ``Rhythms of the Heart''  
reflects about you as a musician and a person? 
</P>
<P>
	Carter: I think that it shows that I'm very curious about other  
people and their cultures and their music, curious enough to really 
try and learn about it and play it. And that I like to take 
chances, especially with things that I'm not maybe so comfortable 
with. I like to face those challenges, and I'm not afraid to put it 
out there for people to see my shortcomings as well as what I know 
that I can do well. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Based on the album, your musical tastes seem pretty eclectic.  
Is there any theme that ties it all together? 
</P>
<P>
	Carter: In doing this project, it was really difficult for me to  
come up with a concept because I've been influenced by a lot of 
different types of music. Growing up in Detroit, I started first 
studying classical European music. Then there was the influence of 
Motown music. And we have a lot of Hispanic, Greek and Arabic 
communities, so hearing that music influenced me in some way. And 
I've recorded with a lot of different groups in different styles of 
jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	So it was hard for me to pick one and say this is who I am. I  
thought what's the best way to present all of my influences?. My 
A&AMP;R person came up with the idea of a rhythmic concept because I 
usually have a strong pull toward the drums and play more 
rhythmically. So I wrote down all the rhythms that had influenced 
me and then found pieces that either represented those rhythms or 
found people to write pieces that would specifically fit them. 
`Rhythms of the Heart' is the rhythms that are most dear to me.

<HEADLINE> Two Special Olympians Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Two Moroccan soccer players are missing  
from their nation's delegation to the Special Olympics World Summer 
Games, bringing the number of vanished athletes to four. 
</P>
<P>
	Niam Tanji, 21, and Jamal Agdani, 23, were last seen at lunch  
Monday and did not attend their soccer match later in the day, 
event officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Moroccan coach told the head of the delegation, who then  
alerted organizers, said Joe Freddoso, chief executive officer of 
the Games. Authorities said there was no indication of foul play. 
</P>
<P>
	Information about the Moroccan athletes has been sent to law  
enforcement agencies across the state. Their names and descriptions 
also have been entered in a national police database. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, two Special Olympics basketball players from the  
Dominican Republic left a shopping trip in Greensboro, took a cab 
to Charlotte and then caught a bus to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The two basketball players were described as highly functional  
mentally retarded men. A sister of one of the athletes lives in New 
York. They have not returned to the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The four missing athletes have broken no law, according to  
authorities. Organizers contacted police in order to find the men 
and make sure they are safe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Special Olympics World Summer Games began June 20 and  
conclude Sunday.

	OWEGO, N.Y. (AP) -- A 22-year-old baby sitter was accused of

	The victim's great-aunt and legal guardian, Donna M. Hollenbeck,  
returned from work Tuesday shortly before 3 a.m. to find the girl 
unconscious, police said. The girl was pronounced dead less than an 
hour later at Robert Packer Hospital in Sayre, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	A preliminary autopsy found that the child died of hyperthermia,  
an abnormally high body temperature, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker pleaded innocent to the murder charge at her arraignment  
and remains in Tioga County Jail without bail awaiting grand jury 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Scherter and other family friends said the child had  
bounced around to at least nine different temporary homes during 
her short life while her mother tried to get back on her feet, 
according to the Press &AMP; Sun-Bulletin of Binghamton. Hollenbeck had 
cared for her for a year and was very loving and attentive, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's not mine but I loved her,'' Hollenbeck said as she  
cried. 
</P>
<P>
	Police would not comment on how the child's body temperature got  
so high. But Hollenbeck and several neighbors said the thermostat 
was turned up to 95 degrees and wiring had been removed so that the 
thermostat could not be lowered.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Medicare Plan Is Affordable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Saying the nation is too prosperous to relegate  
older Americans to a life of sickliness and worry, President 
Clinton today appealed for passage of his Medicare drug plan. ``It 
is constructed in a way America can afford,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president addressed an audience of about 350 senior citizens  
and others at the Chicago Cultural Center, which offers various 
programs for older people. He won generous applause as he argued 
that a cost cannot be put on the lives of older Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that goes way beyond health care and way  
beyond money,'' Clinton said. ``How do you put a price on being 
able to see the birth of a grandchild?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not welfare. This is not some blind gift,'' Clinton  
said. ``This is something we are doing for the integrity of 
families through the generations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president traveled to Chicago for the first of several  
national visits by top administration officials to sell the 
Medicare proposal directly to senior citizens. Later tonight, he 
was speaking at a fund-raising dinner that expected to bring in 
$500,000 for the Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Clinton proposed several changes in Medicare. The  
most significant would have the government help the disabled and 
people 65 and older pay for prescription drugs under Medicare -- up 
to $1,000 a year initially in return for a $24 monthly patient 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The maximum federal payment for drugs would climb to $2,500 by  
2008 as the monthly patient fee rose to $44 in gradual, annual 
steps. However, beneficiaries with annual incomes below $11,000 for 
individuals and $17,000 for couples would pay no premium or 
cost-sharing for drug coverage up to the annual limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the president listened to stories of elderly people  
having to choose between groceries and prescriptions, or stretching 
out their pills to make them last longer -- putting themselves at 
risk of serious illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way I can do without these medications,'' said  
Hanna Bratman, 79, a widow who said she spends $2,800 a year -- 
about 10 percent of her income -- on asthma drugs. ``It's hard to 
describe the fear of not knowing whether you'll be able to afford 
the next medication the doctor prescribes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please do everything you can do to make sure seniors ... can  
get the prescription drugs they need to have,'' Mrs. Bratman told 
Clinton. ``This is just the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Esposito, a geriatric pharmacist in Cicero, Ill., said it  
breaks her heart to watch elderly customers discover they lack 
coverage for their medication, or cannot find other coverage 
because they were rejected as too ill, or literally scrape funds 
together to pay out of their pockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Some advocates for the elderly say Clinton's plan doesn't go far  
enough, and medical industry leaders wonder if they're going to 
wind up paying for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders questioned how the plan would be financed,  
who would pay, whether it would fix Medicare's solvency problems 
and whether his proposed cost restrictions might hinder medical 
breakthroughs and drug innovations. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Democrats, meanwhile, criticized Republicans for  
not immediately and wholeheartedly embracing Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``My fear is that the Republican reaction to this is negative,''  
said House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., at a news 
conference today. ``It's clear to me that the Republican leadership 
simply is responding to special interests and not to the interests 
of ordinary Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether retirees will see Clinton's plan as a good deal remains  
to be seen, said Horace Deets, executive director of the American 
Association of Retired Persons, the nation's largest organization 
of older adults. 
</P>
<P>
	``It requires that Medicare beneficiaries still pay a  
considerable amount of the cost of their drugs and only a vigorous 
public debate will tell us whether older Americans believe that the 
additional premium for prescriptions is affordable,'' said Deets. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if not enacted this year, Clinton's initiative will set the  
markers for a political brawl in next year's elections. It is a 
potent issue because Medicare touches the lives of 39 million 
Americans, and the elderly show up to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and  
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., pledged to seek ``a 
bipartisan solution to expand access to affordable prescription 
drugs.'' Lott expressed interest in providing prescription drugs to 
elderly Americans who ``are poor and cannot afford what they 
need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, health care providers from HMOs to hospitals worried  
that they will be made to sacrifice billions of dollars in payments 
to help achieve Medicare savings to pay for Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``As caregivers, we recognize that prescription drugs are an  
important part of treating illness and enhancing wellness,'' said 
American Hospital Association president Dick Davidson. ``But before 
we expand benefits -- and make new promises -- to Medicare 
beneficiaries, it is essential that we keep our current promises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative groups joined Republican lawmakers in questioning  
whether government-subsidized prescription drug benefits are truly 
needed by all 39 million Medicare beneficiaries, when two-thirds 
already have drug coverage -- mainly from privately purchased 
insurance or retirement benefits from employers.

<HEADLINE>  Tiger Woods Used to Large Gallery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- The gallery engulfed and then nearly  
swallowed him two years ago as he walked up the 18th fairway, ready 
to finish off a victory in the Western Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods, by now, is used to those swarms that follow his  
every move. 
</P>
<P>
	They come to watch him be brilliant. They want to see him  
dominate a game that frustrates millions or rout a confounding 
course with his shot selection. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overwhelming, no. Distracting sometimes. Obviously they're  
making a lot of noise and it depends when they make that noise -- if 
it's in your swing or they catch you in a wrong moment, then it's a 
little tough,'' Woods said Wednesday on the eve of the $2.5 million 
Western Open, which is sponsored by Motorola. 
</P>
<P>
	``They get excited when we pull off shots, and especially shots  
they can't hit. That's what makes it neat when you can go out and 
pull off a few good shots. And who knows? You can get on a little 
hot streak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's on one.  
</P>
<P>
	Woods, with three straight top 10 finishes, and Vijay Singh,  
who's placed in the top five of his last three, lead the Western 
field. U.S. Open champion Payne Stewart and money leader David 
Duval are among those absent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cog Hill Golf and Country Club is where Woods had his first  
sub-70 round in a professional tournament, shooting 69 on the final 
day of the 1995 tournament when he was still an amateur. Two years 
later, he won the tournament, his fourth title during a torrid 1997 
that included a Masters title. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's made some changes in his game, especially with his  
swing, and has two tour victories this season. He reeled off the 
technical alterations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've worked on changing my grip a little bit, worked on my  
first move off the ball,'' he said. ``My swing plane, make sure I 
rounded off in the top instead of early and don't get too deep too 
early. From there, just keep the club head in front of me on the 
way down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods said it's taken some time to adjust.  
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt I have an even more well-rounded game now,'' he said.  
``If you look at the way I played in '97, I did win, yes. But where 
did I finish when I didn't win? I'm finishing higher now when I 
don't have it, which means my swing is better. My short game is 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singh's putting grip is certainly different. Last year's  
Western, where he finished second, is where he committed to a 
cross-handed approach. Seven weeks later, he won the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd putted cross-handed before but this was the first time  
where I said, 'This is it.' And I haven't changed since. This is 
the longest streak I've had putting cross-handed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he led after three rounds last year, Singh didn't  
win the Western because Joe Durant was too good on the final day, 
shooting a 66 to win by two strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't lose it. He won it,'' Singh said.

<HEADLINE> House Hikes Veterans' Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House authorized cost-of-living increases  
for disabled veterans who receive government compensation and in 
the same legislation expanded a variety of other programs for 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, passed Tuesday on a 424-0 vote, would authorize  
increases for both veterans and for survivors of some disabled 
veterans. About 2.3 million veterans received disability 
compensation last month, and the Department of Veterans Affairs 
expects to spend more than $18 billion on such benefits this fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Add a form of lung cancer -- bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma -- to  
the list of service-connect diseases eligible for benefits. This 
type of cancer is not associated with tobacco use. 
</P>
<P>
	--Authorize survivors' benefit payments to spouses of prisoners  
of war who were 100 percent disabled when they died because of 
service-related injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	--Restore eligibility for certain benefits -- medical care,  
education and housing loans -- to surviving spouses who have 
remarried and whose subsequent marriage has ended. 
</P>
<P>
	--Authorize a $65 million loan from the U.S. Treasury to begin  
construction of a memorial to World War II veterans and schedule 
groundbreaking for Veterans Day 2000. The bill also would expand 
the American Battle Monuments Commission's authority to raise money 
for the memorial. About $57 million in private money has been 
pledged. 
</P>
<P>
	--Grant permanent eligibility for housing loans to national  
reservists and National Guard members who have served a minimum of 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Authorize $100 million over five years for the Labor Department  
to run a program to help homeless veterans find work. 
</P>
<P>
	--Direct the VA Department to obligate money and begin planning  
to buy four new national cemeteries for veterans and to begin a 
comprehensive study of burial space needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The House also passed by voice vote a bill offering technical,  
financial and other help to businesses owned by veterans. A third 
bill, also passed by voice vote, commemorates the 100th anniversary 
of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bills are H.R. 2280, H.J. Res. 34 and H.R. 1568.

<HEADLINE> Honduran To Remain in NYC for Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The 13-year-old Honduran boy who fooled New  
Yorkers with his tale of journeying thousands of miles to find a 
dad he'd never met will remain here until authorities figure out 
what to do with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin Sabillon stayed with a foster family Wednesday and is  
under the care of the Administration for Children's Services. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy duped police and city officials with his tale of a  
fantastic journey. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin told police his mother, brother and grandfather were  
killed in a mudslide last year when Hurricane Mitch pummeled 
Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his father in New York City had wired him $200 and he  
left home May 22, hitchhiking, taking buses and walking his way 
north through Mexico and Texas to Miami, where strangers bought him 
a bus ticket to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	But interviews conducted by The Associated Press showed that  
Edwin's mother is alive and living in Honduras, his father died of 
AIDS last year, and that Edwin had been living in Florida with an 
aunt since March. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin's grandmother in Honduras, who raised him since his mother  
abandoned him shortly after his birth, says she wants him back. But 
city officials say it is too early to say if the boy will be 
returned to his native country, remain here, or be taken to 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin's aunt in Hialeah, Fla., said she does not have enough  
money to care for the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would gladly keep him but I can't support him financially,''  
Aurora Sabillon said Wednesday in a telephone interview. ``But if 
there's a family in New York who wants to adopt him, and can 
support him, I would agree to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Honduran consulate officials here talked to Edwin,  
but would not say what was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	When police detectives told Edwin on Tuesday night that they had  
learned his story was false, he owned up to his fabrication. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials and residents seem willing to forgive the boy,  
and even admitted that New Yorkers -- reputed to be uniquely gifted 
at sniffing out scams -- were charmed by the 90-pound lad with big 
brown puppy dog eyes and a sweet grin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a credit to the city that he was able to dupe the  
entire city,'' Police Commissioner Howard Safir said. ``Because 
people talk about hard-nosed cops, and people talk about hard-nosed 
politicians. This is a situation where he pulled all of our 
heartstrings.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Soar; Dow Ends Up 155.45 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks soared Wednesday, with some market  
indexes smashing through to record highs, as the Federal Reserve 
raised interest rates but hinted that a single, modest increase 
might be all that's needed to quell inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 155.45 to close at  
10,970.80, rounding out a session that saw the index drop as much 
as 83 points in morning trading, then pop over 11,000 for the first 
time since May 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's rally propelled broader market indicators to new  
closing highs. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 21.26 to 
1,372.71, beating its previous record of 1,367.56 reached May 13. 
The Nasdaq composite index rose 44.01 to close at 2,686.12, 
eclipsing the previous high of 2,652.05 set April 26. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market got a major relief rally,'' said John Shaughnessy,  
chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices, battered for weeks by the threat of inflation and  
higher interest rates, also recovered, sending yields on the 
30-year Treasury bond falling to 5.96 percent from 6.06 percent 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's Open Market Committee surprised few with the  
announcement of a quarter-percentage point increase in short-term 
interest rates. But the committee also returned to what's called a 
neutral bias on interest rates, which indicates Fed officials 
believe they may not need to follow up Wednesday's rate action with 
additional increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders welcomed the Fed's announcement, hoping for an end to  
the volatile price swings and sluggish trading that has 
characterized the market since mid-May, when the Fed first signaled 
its willingness to raise rates in an effort to hold inflation down. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank and brokerage stocks were among the first to benefit, as  
the Fed's future course appeared less punishing than previously 
feared. Shares of those companies are particularly vulnerable to 
higher interest rates, which cut into lending volume. 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan rose 4 3/4 to 140 1/2, the strongest gainer among Dow  
components. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter shot up 7 7/8 to 102 5/8, and 
Schwab gained 8 7/8 to close at 109. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts were quick to caution that the Fed's neutral bias  
leaves it plenty of room to impose higher rates if it finds further 
indications that inflation has crept into the still-booming 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did not close the door on further rate increases,'' said  
Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America, who 
expects the Fed to raise rates two to four more times -- each time 
by a quarter percentage point -- over the course of the next 12 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday marked the end of the second quarter and first half,  
and some money managers shifted their portfolios up to the last 
minute, hoping to settle positions left in limbo while investors 
awaited the Fed's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	David G. Sowerby, a vice president at Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co., said  
the sluggishness of the past few weeks should be easy to forget in 
light of the market's vibrant performance in the first half. The 
Dow has gained 19.5 percent in the year to date. The Nasdaq, which 
is dominated by technology stocks, gained 22.5 percent in the first 
half, and the S&AMP;P 500 gained 11.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sowerby noted that a wide range of stocks in the S&AMP;P 500 rose  
over the course of the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a broader, deeper leadership,'' he said. ``Many  
people will be pleasantly surprised when they look at their 401(k)s 
or mutual fund statements from this quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the overall market continued its rally Wednesday, some  
stocks were left on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of long-distance phone companies were mostly lower. MCI  
WorldCom faltered, slipping 7 9/16 to 86 1/16, amid reports of a 
Justice Department antitrust investigation of its undersea cable 
business. Also, one Wall Street analyst predicted an industry price 
war as the companies struggle for competitive position. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney was lower for much of the session after Merrill Lynch  
analyst Jessica Reif Cohen forecast lower earnings for fiscal years 
1999 and 2000. The ebullience of the afternoon session lifted 
Disney shares, however, to close at 30 13/16, up 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. NYSE composite volume totaled a robust 
1.33 billion shares, compared to 964.00 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 10.14 to 648.13, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 20.45 to 797.93. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.60 to 457.68. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.42 percent.  
European indexes were mostly higher, as Germany's DAX index was up 
0.4 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.2 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 rose 0.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Druckenmiller Trial May Be Moved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHRISTIANSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Prosecutors want to move the rape  
trial of San Francisco 49ers reserve quarterback Jim Druckenmiller 
to prevent ``favorable bias'' for the former Virginia Tech star. 
</P>
<P>
	Selecting a neutral jury in Montgomery County ``may be an  
impossible task,'' assistant commonwealth's attorney Peggy Frank 
said in a motion filed Wednesday in Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The motion said there are ``so many people within the community  
who have some affiliation to Virginia Tech or its athletic programs 
and would potentially show favorable bias toward the defendant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It said there ``appears to be popular sentiment towards the  
defendant because of his status as a national football player and 
standout as a Virginia Tech quarterback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case against Druckenmiller, 26, is based on an alleged March  
4 incident at a Blacksburg house. The accuser, a recent Virginia 
Tech graduate, said Druckenmiller had sex with her against her will 
after a night of partying. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers have said the woman agreed to have sex with  
Druckenmiller and aggressively pursued him. 
</P>
<P>
	Bev Davis, one of Druckenmiller's lawyers, said the motion to  
move the trial was without merit and would be opposed during a 
pretrial hearing July 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Trial is scheduled for July 19.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Takes Time Out for Cubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- President Clinton came to Chicago to talk  
Medicare but wound up witnessing Sammy Sosa's 30th home run this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a speech Wednesday to pitch his new Medicare proposal  
to senior citizens, the president went to Wrigley Field to watch 
the Chicago Cubs-Milwaukee Brewers game. He was so excited about 
going to the game that he announced it at the start of his speech -- 
to the annoyance of the Secret Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton paused at a local hotel to change out of his business  
suit and keep tabs on the Northern Ireland peace talks. He spoke 
for about 10 minutes with British Prime Minister Tony Blair to get 
an update, then zipped over to Wrigley Field, where the score was 
4-3 Brewers in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	The president settled in the Cubs' owner's box, looking relaxed  
in a yellow, open-necked shirt and brown blazer. He waved to the 
fans. Some booed, others craned to catch a view of him. 
</P>
<P>
	In the seventh inning, Sosa slammed a ball over the left field  
wall for the game-winning home run. Clinton, clutching a half-eaten 
hot dog and a Cubs baseball cap in his left hand, stood and 
applauded. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs won 5-4. After the game, Cubs general manager Ed Lynch  
took Clinton to the clubhouse to congratulate Sosa. Lockhart said 
Clinton and Sosa hadn't seen each other since Sosa came to the 
White House in January for the State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Sosa chatted for 10 minutes in the locker room and  
for another 10 minutes alone in a nearby room. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa gave Clinton a blue Cubs jacket and a red Beanie Baby toy  
with a Cubs emblem on the package. The two exchanged autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He brings good luck,'' Sosa said of Clinton. ``A big guy like  
that comes to town to see the game -- it doesn't look too good if we 
lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton dropped his  
usual impartial stance on sports to root for Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was asked whether his wife, Hillary, would allow him to  
keep the jacket, given her newfound loyalty to the New York 
Yankees. Clinton nodded yes -- after a slow pause. He teasingly 
chastised a reporter who asked whether both Clintons were Cubs 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what she said. Don't play press games here,'' he  
said, smiling. ``This is about sports, not politics.''

<HEADLINE> Govt Outlines Electronic Check Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans would be able to receive Social  
Security and other federal benefit payments electronically, under a 
low-cost account program outlined by Vice President Al Gore today. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, spoke about the program at an event in New York and  
offered final details on the plan which was proposed by the 
Treasury Department last year, following the mandates of a 1996 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounts would be available to anyone who receives a federal  
benefit -- from Social Security and veterans benefits to federal 
employee pensions -- Gore said in a statement released by his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	The payments would be electronically transferred from the  
government into the low-cost accounts. Tax refunds, however, are 
not included. 
</P>
<P>
	The program is designed to particularly help the several million  
Americans who, for various reasons, currently don't have bank 
accounts and now receive federal benefit payments in the mail. The 
program could reduce the risk of these government checks getting 
stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department has been encouraging federally insured  
banks, savings institutions and credit unions to voluntarily set up 
low-cost accounts to accept the electronically transferred federal 
benefit payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore listed the first financial institutions to have preliminary  
agreements to offer the low-cost accounts: Banco Popular de Puerto 
Rico &AMP; NA; Bank of America; Britton &AMP; Koontz First National Bank; 
Chase Manhattan Bank; Washington State Bank; and Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, the government pays each institution a one-time  
per-account fee to set up an account. The program is being offered 
only through federally insured financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The program is believed to save the government money in the  
long-run as people switch over to the electronic payment system. 
That would reduce the government's costs for mailing and printing 
benefit checks. 
</P>
<P>
	People who have the accounts would be subject to a maximum fee  
of $3 a month. Account holders would have a minimum of four cash 
withdrawals and four balance inquiries each month -- either from 
tellers or through automated teller machines -- that would be 
covered by the $3 fee. The accounts would be subject to the same 
consumer protections that the financial institutions make available 
to other account holders. 
</P>
<P>
	There would be no minimum balance -- except as required by  
federal or state law -- and account holders would get monthly 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	It's up to the financial institutions to decide whether or not  
to pay interest on account balances. 
</P>
<P>
	Many banks, S&AMP;Ls and credit unions already offer low-cost  
checking accounts. But for a variety of reasons, including fear of 
stiff bounced-check fees, an estimated 8 million Americans have no 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 requires most  
federal payments, except for tax refunds, to eventually be made by 
electronic transfers. An exemption is available to people if an 
electronic deposit would cause a hardship.

<HEADLINE> Venus Williams Ousts Kournikova </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- In a battle of tennis teen-agers,  
Venus Williams was shaky at the start but strong at the finish, 
brushing aside Anna Kournikova at Wimbledon on Wednesday to set up 
a quarterfinal confrontation with seven-time champion Steffi Graf. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old Williams overpowered the Russian 3-6, 6-3, 6-2  
and now has the chance to end Graf's bid to win Wimbledon for an 
eighth time, just one short of Martina Navratilova's record. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some good matchups and I'm definitely ready to  
compete,'' Williams said. ``I have to try to get to the semis. I 
have never before. She has had seven wins so I've got to try to 
take something for myself this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who has a 2-2 record against Graf but has won their  
last two meetings, reached the quarterfinals last year before 
losing in two close sets to eventual champion Jana Novotna. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the 19-year-old Kournikova, she seemed to be building  
her game up to something big. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of Tuesday's rainout, the match between two of the  
game's biggest attractions was switched from Centre Court to Court 
18. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of playing before some 14,000 fans, Williams and  
Kournikova battled it out before little more than 1,000. The court 
holds only 788 but many more found vantage points on balconies to 
catch a glimpse of the two stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams looked tentative at the start as Kournikova raced to a  
4-0 lead, then closed out the set with an immaculate serve and 
volley. 
</P>
<P>
	But the American turned the match around when she broke for 3-1  
in the second. Kournikova began to wilt under the pressure of 
Williams' improving game and increasing power. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian won only two games out of 11 as Williams took the  
second set and moved into a 4-0 lead in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Kournikova was able to hold twice at love, she couldn't  
handle Williams' serve. The American clinched a place in the 
quarters with a high backhand volley winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams acknowledged she can't let Graf race away to an early  
lead when they meet Thursday on Centre Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't want to do that,'' she said. ``I don't want to do it  
in any match. It's not fun being behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going out there and be ready to play, ready to attack  
and take the opportunities and definitely believe in what you're 
doing and concentrate on yourself. 
</P>
<P>
	``She (Graf) loves the game and when you love something you have  
to work hard to be the best at it,'' Williams said. ``I'm working 
my hardest to get to the top spot. I'm trying my best to get there 
and I'm getting better.''

<HEADLINE> Star Watch: John Leguizamo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- He was just a pipsqueak then, a rail-thin,  
curly-haired goofball who was blessed -- or cursed -- with a sly 
smile and a Gatling-gun mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	John Leguizamo was 14 in the summer of '77. New York City was  
sweltering. The discos were hotter. And there was a maniac out 
there with a .44-caliber handgun. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember it. Yeah, I do,'' Leguizamo says. ``It was coming  
of age for me. That whole summer, I was on a mission. I was trying 
to de-virginize myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At night, he remembers, he would put on his Lothario outfit: a  
three-piece Polyester disco suit and an unbuttoned shirt with huge 
lapels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would take my mother's mascara and draw a mustache and a  
beard. I would go to clubs with a fake ID from Times Square. I 
would say, 'Hey, lemme in. I'm a midget, man!''' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, he recalls, the bodies continued to mount.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was paranoia. People wouldn't even hang out in the  
streets. Lovers' lanes were empty. I used to bike there all the 
time to see if I could learn something -- you know, through all the 
fogged up windows. But there wasn't anything. It was creepy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-two summers later, Leguizamo has returned to those  
murderous days in Spike Lee's ``Summer of Sam,'' a story about 
neighborhood friends living during the Son of Sam's bloody reign. A 
former postal worker named David Berkowitz was arrested 22 years 
ago and confessed to fatally shooting six people and wounding seven 
others. He later said he took orders from a neighbor's black 
Labrador retriever named Sam. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbian-born Leguizamo, now 35, was a natural choice as the  
film's lead. He was raised here, after all, skipping from one 
working-class neighborhood to the next throughout his adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
	He studied theater at New York University and dabbled in  
stand-up comedy before earning attention with his quirky one-man, 
off-Broadway shows, ``Mambo Mouth'' and ``Spic-O-Rama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After making his film debut as a soldier in ``Casualties of  
War,'' he tried to kill Harrison Ford in ``Regarding Henry'' and 
succeeded in offing Al Pacino in ``Carlito's Way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a little tired of being the guy that gets shot in the  
first half-hour, or the messenger. I love villains and I love 
gangsters, but it has to be three-dimensional -- got to have respect 
and dignity. Well, as much as a drug dealer can have respect and 
dignity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was mostly unarmed and drug-free in ``Hangin' With the  
Homeboys,'' ``Whispers in the Dark'' and ``Super Mario Bros,'' but 
packed a weapon in ``Revenge,'' ``William Shakespeare's Romeo &AMP; 
Juliet'' and ``Die Hard 2.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leguizamo made jaws drop as a cross-dressing diva in 1995's ``To  
Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar'' and as Clown, a 
corpulent demon who spewed bawdy one-liners in ``Spawn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also launched the raucous but short-lived Fox TV  
sketch-comedy series ``House of Buggin,''' becoming the first 
Latino since Desi Arnaz to star in, co-write and co-produce a 
prime-time show. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't easy, he says. Before Sammy Sosa began crushing  
baseballs, or Jennifer Lopez and Ricky Martin showed up in tight 
pants, Leguizamo found the mainstream running mostly uphill. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, of course, America has been bitten by the Latin bug.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time, man,'' he says. ``Thank God! People now know  
that we've got really good-looking Latin people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The talent's always been there,'' he adds. ``The inroads that  
Latin people have made are still not as close as what they should 
be, but we've put our mark on this country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the most important talent that we need to nurture is  
the writers. That's where you get the intellect of a culture -- the 
ideas, the soul,'' he says. ``It's just a matter of our stories 
being told. And they are being told.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Told mostly by Leguizamo himself. Last year, he won raves and  
two Tony nominations for his Broadway show, ``Freak,'' dubbed a 
``semi-demi-quasi-pseudo-autobiographical comedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Freak'' celebrated Leguizamo's dysfunctional parents; The  
spare, one-man show winked at sex, his fat brother and strutting 
friends; it lampooned Irish lasses, Italian toughs, Latino 
attitudes, love and more sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's free,'' says Leguizamo's ``Summer of Sam'' co-star,  
Adrien Brody. ``He doesn't censor himself. A lot of people are 
worried about taking risks. Not John. And when someone is taking a 
risk, it's easier to take a risk yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His parents, however, were horrified: Mom came off equal parts  
smothering and neglectful -- a sort of protective disco queen -- 
while Dad emerged as a physically abusive, raging alcoholic waiter. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened is that I wrote it and it was easy to write  
because there were no repercussions,'' he says. ``I thought I was 
doing it TO them. When I took it to Broadway, I realized, 'Oh my 
God, I was doing it to MYSELF.''' 
</P>
<P>
	And now? ``I feel now I'm OK with it,'' he replies.  
</P>
<P>
	Based in part on the strength of ``Freak,'' Leguizamo signed a  
first-look deal with Miramax Films to develop movie and TV 
projects. After Spike Lee's new flick, he has two more coming out, 
both with regal names: ``Joe the King'' and ``King of the Jungle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then it's off to rub shoulders with Ewan McGregor and Nicole  
Kidman in director Baz Luhrmann's ``Moulin Rouge,'' a musical set 
in the Paris of 1899. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-time pipsqueak has finally got some Hollywood pull.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a little clout,'' he says, modestly, like a little boy.  
``Yeah!'' he reconsiders, lifting his arms in the air. ``I've got 
huge clout. My clout! Raise the roof! I love my clout.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One critic doesn't care and has already given Leguizamo's new  
film about the summer '77 a thumbs-down. The critic is Berkowitz 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	From inside Sullivan Correctional Facility, a maximum-security  
prison in upstate New York, Berkowitz told The New York Times he's 
unhappy ``Summer of Sam'' dredges up the awful past. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's interesting that Berkowitz feels that he still has  
rights. I mean, of course, it's America and I respect the 
Constitution and I'd love to hear what he has to say. But at the 
end of day, it doesn't have any weight,'' Leguizamo says. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has no rights about how his image is portrayed, or how his  
image is misportrayed. You killed eight people! You took people's 
lives, man. What happened to their rights?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leguizamo isn't scared any more.

<HEADLINE> Time for a 'Wimbledome'? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- The first week of dry, warm weather at  
Wimbledon proved too good to be true. The curse of Wimbledon 
weather struck back with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
	All but five matches were rained out Monday. And not a  
competitive ball was struck Tuesday as the entire day's play was 
washed out. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 30th complete washout in Wimbledon history, and the  
first since 1997, when two straight days were wiped out by rain. 
</P>
<P>
	All of which begs the question: Why not have a Wimbledome?  
</P>
<P>
	Paul McNamee, director of the Australian Open, says it's high  
time the All England Club put up a stadium roof. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian Open has a sliding roof on its center court  
stadium and is building another on its main show court. 
</P>
<P>
	While Wimbledon wants to protect its tradition, McNamee said,  
the club should also consider the needs of fans, players and 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	``The easiest solution would have been to build Court 1 with a  
roof,'' he said. ``That would have guaranteed play would have gone 
on at all times and you wouldn't have changed Centre Court at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon had a chance to add a retractable roof when the new  
Court 1 was opened in 1997. But the attitude has been, it's an 
outdoor tournament and it will stay that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Interestingly, the public here will still sit in the rain and  
have a good time,'' McNamee said. ``But it could be better than 
that. In Australia we could not get away with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wimbledon is still able to get away with it, but I doubt if  
that can happen forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released Tuesday, the All England Club reiterated  
its reasons for not having a stadium roof: 
</P>
<P>
	-- the players prefer to play outdoors.  
</P>
<P>
	-- a covered court would not stand up to two week's play.  
</P>
<P>
	-- a roof on only one court would not significantly alleviate a  
backlog of matches and would be unfair to those players who were 
unable to play on the other 17 courts. 
</P>
<P>
	-- only a fraction of spectators would benefit.  
</P>
<P>
	-- a roof would damage ``the very essence'' of the tournament.  
</P>
<P>
	``Rain is tedious for everyone, and we understand and share the  
frustrations of fans during a rain delay,'' club chief executive 
Christopher Gorringe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Putting roofs on Centre or No. 1 Court ... merely creates  
difficulties in other areas ... deciding which matches should be 
played indoors and whether those players who play indoors receive 
an unfair advantage over those who do not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans come to Wimbledon because they still want to see the  
world's finest tennis players in action outdoors, on grass and 
across all 18 courts,'' he said. `We continue to believe that 
should remain so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers hoped to get all of the 11 remaining fourth-round  
matches completed today. 
</P>
<P>
	Steffi Graf was due up first on Court 1, only two games away  
from victory against Belgian qualifier Kim Clijsters. Graf was 
leading 6-2, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf and Clijsters warmed up for a few minutes Tuesday before  
showers sent them scurrying back to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Henman and Jim Courier spent less than a minute on Centre  
Court before the drizzle forced them back indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	With Henman leading two sets to one, the match was scheduled to  
resume today after the serve-and-volley duel between Boris Becker 
and Patrick Rafter. 
</P>
<P>
	Other featured matches include Venus Williams vs. Anna  
Kournikova, Pete Sampras vs. Daniel Nestor, Greg Rusedski vs. Mark 
Philippoussis and Todd Martin vs. Goran Ivanisevic.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Four gunmen on motorcycles shot a  
Colombian congressman to death on Wednesday at a resort he owned in 
an area of rebel activity. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second assassination of a Colombian lawmaker in a  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Arnoldo Parra, of the opposition Liberal Party, was elected  
to Congress for the first time last year on a promise to donate his

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- About 100 high-level police agents  
said Wednesday they will resign if President Hugo Chavez carries 
through on a proposal to appoint a general as head of Venezuela's 
version of the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, the leader of a failed 1992 coup attempt, reportedly  
plans to name Gen. Vasilly Kotosky Flores as vice justice minister, 
which also would put him in charge of the Technical Judicial 
Police. 
</P>
<P>
	Since taking office in February, Chavez has appointed scores of  
soldiers to government posts, provoking criticism that he is 
militarizing the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Eliseo Guzman, head of detectives at the judicial police, said a  
general would be unequipped to run the agency, which carries out 
investigations into murders, drug trafficking, theft and other 
crimes. 
</P>

	Meanwhile, Venezuela's comptroller said Wednesday he is opening  
an investigation into whether Chavez violated campaign laws by 
using public funds to promote candidates for a constituent assembly 
that will rewrite the constitution.

	PALENQUE, Mexico (AP) -- The loss of ancient Indian relics  
through theft seriously undermines research on Mexico's 
pre-Colombian history, according to experts meeting here. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last year, Mexican authorities have recovered more than  
10,000 relics stolen from archaeological sites, according to Teresa 
Franco y Gonzalez, head of Mexico's National Anthropology and 
History Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Though no items have been stolen from the 100 archaeological  
sites open to the public in Mexico, Franco y Gonzalez said the 
institute could not afford to post security guards at other 
archaeological sites. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400 archaeological experts were gathered in Palenque,  
in the southern state of Chiapas, to discuss the social 
organization of the Mayan culture that dominated the region 
centuries ago.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Foreigners traveling to the interior of  
Mexico will be charged a $15 entry fee starting Thursday, the first 
fee of its kind in the country, immigration authorities announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Migration Institute said the money collected at  
entry points will be used to improve its service and promote Mexico 
as a tourist destination. It expects the fee to generate $600 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreigners making short visits -- less than 72 hours -- to cities  
within 16 miles of the border will be exempted from the fee. Also 
excluded will be visitors in special ``tourist corridors,'' such as 
the popular towns of Ensenada, Puerto Penasco, Paquime, Santa Rosa 
and Presa El Cuchillo.

<HEADLINE> Samsung Motors Seeks Receivership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Samsung Motors Inc. applied for court  
receivership Wednesday after the struggling Korean automaker failed 
to reach an agreement with the Daewoo industrial group on a 
takeover plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Samsung and Daewoo had tentatively agreed to swap their  
carmaking and home appliance subsidiaries as part of a government 
drive to reduce a glut in factory capacity and improve the 
competitiveness of the nation's largest businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	But after more than six months of negotiations, Samsung and  
Daewoo differed widely over the price of Samsung Motors and other 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Under South Korean law, a company can continue to operate  
pending a court decision on its request for receivership, which 
usually takes two or three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Samsung's chairman Lee Kun-hee will offer personal stock worth  
an estimated $2.3 billion in Samsung Life Insurance Co. to pay off 
part of the carmaker's debts of $3.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Samsung officials said they will continue to talk with creditors  
to decide whether to sell the carmaker to Daewoo, as originally 
agreed, or to a third party. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expressed concern that the deal's failure may cause  
jitters on South Korean financial markets, which have been 
recovering after the country's 1997 financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's announcement shows that reforms at large conglomerates  
are not being carried out as expected,'' said Lee Jong-hwa, an 
economics professor at Ewha Women's University. ``I am afraid 
foreign investors will take this as a very negative sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samsung Motors has been cited as a typical case of  
over-investment by South Korean conglomerates. The company, with an 
annual capacity of 240,000 cars, entered the nation's already 
saturated auto market in early 1998. It produced only 50,000 cars 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A restructuring of South Korea's ailing conglomerates was a key  
condition of a $58 billion bailout of the country's economy by the 
International Monetary Fund in late 1997.

<HEADLINE> Co-Pilot Found Guilty in Fatal Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT STEWART, Ga. (AP) -- A military judge on Wednesday found the  
co-pilot of an Army helicopter guilty of wrongfully appropriating 
the aircraft involved in a Bahamas crash that killed his wife and 
the wife of another pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators accused the men of taking their wives on a joyride  
that turned tragic aboard the UH-60 Blackhawk. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge acquitted Riddell of conspiracy in the July 6, 1998  
crash of the helicopter he co-piloted and dropped dereliction of 
duty charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, Col. Kenneth Pangburn, sentenced Riddell to a  
reprimand and $4,500 in fines and pay forfeiture. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am pleased with the judge's decision,'' said Riddell, who  
could have received two years in prison and been dismissed from the 
Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Riddell was charged along with Chief Warrant Officer David Guido  
-- the pilot -- and Sgt. William Westgate, who were in the Bahamas 
for a drug-interdiction mission. The crash on Grand Exuma Island 
killed Rebecca Riddell and Pam Guido. 
</P>
<P>
	Riddell testified that he took his wife on the flight as a  
reward for all she had put up with during his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Guido was convicted earlier this month of conspiracy, wrongful  
appropriation of an aircraft and violation of a lawful general 
regulation. He was sentenced to a reprimand plus fines and 
forfeited pay totaling $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Westgate, an avionics technician, is scheduled to be court  
martialed July 8. He is charged with conspiracy and willful 
dereliction of duty.

<HEADLINE> Coke Earnings Hurt by Health Scare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The health scare in Europe over some Coke  
products, combined with continued economic problems in other 
overseas markets, will hurt Coca-Cola's second-quarter earnings, 
the company announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide unit case volume will be down 1 to 2 percent for the  
quarter, with a decline of 6 to 7 percent expected in Coke's 
Greater Europe Group. Unit case volume is an industry measure 
representing 24 eight-ounce servings sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola products are returning to the shelves in Belgium,  
France and Luxembourg, where bans on some beverages were lifted 
last week. Sales were halted for about 16 days after authorities 
linked 249 cases of sickness to contaminated Coke products. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola said it hopes to recover volume in Europe through  
special promotions. But earnings per share for the quarter ending 
Wednesday will ``reflect the loss of sales in several key 
markets,'' the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke said worldwide gallon sales also are expected to decline  
slightly for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``From an economic standpoint, we believe that the worst is  
behind us and we remain optimistic about improving business 
conditions in the second half of this year and into the year 
2000,'' said M. Douglas Ivester, Coke's chairman and chief 
executive officer.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Charged With Racist Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A lawsuit accuses Microsoft of including a  
``racially-charged'' message linking black people to monkeys in its 
Publisher 1998 software. The company has agreed to alter the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	John Elijah, 32, filed the suit Tuesday in San Diego federal  
court, claiming users will see images that include a black couple 
sitting on monkey bars when they type ``monkey'' to access pictures 
of the animal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt the blood rushing out of my whole body,'' said Elijah,  
a black construction worker who was shown the image by a co-worker. 
``I was humiliated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Greg Shaw said the company already has  
offered a software update to anyone who requests it. He said the 
Publisher 2000 software itself does not contain the image. 
</P>
<P>
	``We regret any offense or inconvenience,'' Shaw said. ``We are  
deeply committed to doing everything possible to prevent this in 
the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elijah is demanding that Microsoft pay $75,000 in damages and  
alter the software, which is used to create newsletters and 
documents with graphics and pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	Elijah's attorney, Harvey Levine, is seeking approval of a class  
action lawsuit for the estimated 4 million customers who bought the 
software. 
</P>
<P>
	Levine suspects the picture was specifically programmed to  
appear as ``some sort of sick insider joke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Shaw said the link was unintentional. He said the software  
contains images that can be accessed by using several key words. A 
computer user who searched for ``couple'' may have accessed the 
photo as well as someone who typed ``bar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, ``monkey'' brings up an assortment of pictures  
including monkeys in trees, a gorilla and the closely-cropped photo 
of the black couple. 
</P>
<P>
	Elijah, who is married and has two children, said his wife was  
extremely upset over the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her biggest fear is that maybe skinheads or people like that  
will face off with me,'' he said. ``She's afraid people will think 
I'm doing this for the money, and not because I want it fixed.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Raises $35.5M, Outpaces Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush, shattering presidential  
fund-raising records, raised $35.5 million in the first six months 
of 1999, nearly 10 times as much as his closest Republican rival 
and millions more than Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's fund-raising prowess has virtually dried up the pool of  
GOP money for his rivals. The $35.5 million figure is also 
remarkable since the Texas governor did not actively start 
fund-raising until March. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who only has one Democratic rival and has the power of the  
White House behind him, raised $17 million less than Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, at a news conference today in Los Angeles, said his  
campaign was still counting donations and termed the $35.5 million 
figure a ``minimum number'' after a fund-raiser in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am humbled by the response,'' he said. ``I am, as you can  
imagine, amazed at the outpouring of support. This is a campaign 
that has got a wide range of people who are willing to help people 
from all around the country. I'm gratified and that's that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, appearing somewhat overwhelmed by the reports, was asked  
how he explained the record fund-raising. ``A wonderful 
personality,'' he replied. ``Seriously, that's what the pundits are 
going to have to figure out. I've got a lot of friends . . . people 
are hungry for something it's beyond expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who released his totals Tuesday, collected $18.2 million  
to $18.5 million in the first six months of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	His only rival, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, will report  
slightly more than $11.5 million in overall contributions, 
according to his spokesman Eric Hauser. 
</P>
<P>
	``This demonstrates the strength of Al Gore's support throughout  
the country,'' Gore's deputy chairman, Marla Romash, said. 
</P>
<P>
	After raising twice as much as Bradley in the first three months  
of the year, Gore watched the second-quarter margin close: He 
raised about $9 million in the last three months, compared with a 
surprisingly strong $7 million for underdog Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``That shows there are still a lot of people out there who would  
like to see a horse race,'' said Stephen Hess of the Brookings 
Institution, a Washington think tank. ``While Gore seems to want to 
give the impression that we can skip the preliminaries and go right 
to the general election, it's not that simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is far ahead of Bradley in polls of Democratic voters. The  
latest CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll gave Gore a 3-1 lead over the 
former basketball-star-turned-politician. 
</P>
<P>
	``That, to us, is the margin that counts,'' Romash said. ``Al  
Gore never takes anything for granted and runs every race as the 
challenger, but it's important to note that when you look at who 
Democratic voters are supporting, overwhelmingly it's Al Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romash said Gore would break the second-quarter fund-raising  
total set by Bob Dole in 1995. But so did Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is virtually drying up the pool of Republican cash, causing  
his rivals to struggle to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Bush's fund-raising -- and his gain the polls at her  
expense, Elizabeth Dole said there was plenty of time left to catch 
the Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look who's saying he can't lose; The pundits. The same pundits  
who said Bill Clinton would have to resign after the Monica 
Lewinsky affair. The same pundits who said Bush's father could 
never lose after the Persian Gulf War,'' Mrs. Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, who aides say has raised between $2 million and $4  
million, has a fund-raiser tonight and plans to spend much weekend 
in Iowa and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in it to win,'' Mrs. Dole said in a telephone interview.  
``I'm hitting my stride. I'm going the distance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to campaign aides:  
</P>
<P>
	--Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, has raised $1.6 million this year,  
including just $600,000 in the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
	--Former Vice President Dan Quayle expects to raise $1 million in  
the second quarter after taking $2.1 million in the first three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	--Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, like Quayle, has cut  
staff and travel plans to make ends meet. He will report raising 
more than $2 million overall. 
</P>
<P>
	--Arizona Sen. John McCain, chairman of the influential Senate  
Commerce Committee, is doing better than other non-Bush hopefuls, 
but still will report raising less than $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	--Publisher Steve Forbes and conservative activist Gary Bauer  
will be in the $2 million to $4 million range. 
</P>
<P>
	--New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith, a longshot, will report more than  
$1 million in contributions, spokeswoman Karen Hickey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives Pat Buchanan and Alan Keyes did not provide  
figures.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Strikes Down Part of Megan's Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The state Supreme Court on Wednesday struck  
down a major portion of Megan's Law, a measure that forces sexual 
assault convicts to announce their presence in their chosen 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled that the law improperly presumes people are  
guilty by classifying them as ``sexual predators'' for life. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling effectively struck down a provision that allowed  
communities to be notified when certain sex crime offenders move 
in. But the court did not touch a portion that requires someone 
with the less-severe classification of ``sexual offender'' to tell 
state police, not the community, where they are. 
</P>
<P>
	Every state has some version of Megan's Law, said Ronald Chen,  
associate law dean at Rutgers University in Newark, N.J. He said 
the law has been revised to meet constitutional tests, and has been 
upheld by federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys say the 1995 law -- a version of one in New  
Jersey named for a girl who was raped and killed by a convict in 
her neighborhood -- improperly reverses the burden of proof in 
criminal cases, which presumes innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	The predator classification requires the convicts to register  
with police on their whereabouts once they leave prison. Police 
then notify the communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Supreme Court Justice Stephen Zappala said he found the law's  
presumption that a person is a sexually violent predator 
``constitutionally repugnant.'' The determination is made by a 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Crimes for which a person can be classified a ``predator''  
include kidnapping, rape, forcing a child into prostitution or 
crimes involving obscene pictures, indecent assault or spousal 
sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	While the 6-1 ruling invalidates the community notification  
provisions of the law for predators, the court did not touch the 
portion that requires someone with the less-severe classification 
of ``sexual offender'' to tell state police where they are for 10 
years. Police do not notify communities of the presence of ``sexual 
offenders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a dissenting opinion, Justice Ronald Castille said the law  
``is a mere sentencing scheme and does not create a separate 
criminal offense'' that would violate the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney whose case resulted in the Pennsylvania  
court's ruling said he may appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> Good News For Heart Defect Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A heart defect described as serious and occasionally fatal to  
millions of Americans is far less dangerous and common than doctors 
believed, researchers reported today in two new studies. 
</P>
<P>
	The defect -- called mitral valve prolapse -- has long been  
considered a ``hidden epidemic'' afflicting 5 percent to 30 percent 
of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	But the researchers said many patients probably have nothing to  
worry about, and they also found that prolapse strikes men and 
women equally, contradicting medical lore that it was especially 
common in women under 45. 
</P>
<P>
	``That really is a sea change,'' said Dr. Marc Klapholz,  
director of the heart failure program at University Hospital in 
Newark, N.J. ``It's extremely good news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The research is reported in today's New England Journal of  
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have routinely warned patients that the condition, while  
often symptomless, may require surgery to prevent complications 
that can cause sudden death. Among those complications: stroke, 
heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms that cause fainting. 
</P>
<P>
	But researchers determined that the patients who actually had  
mitral valve prolapse suffered those complications at about the 
same rate, just 6 percent, as a healthy comparison group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't assume that it's a sort of death sentence,'' concluded  
Dr. Emelia Benjamin, a professor of medicine at Boston University 
who led one of the studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Her advice: Talk to your doctor about a re-test, particularly if  
you were diagnosed years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The mitral valve lets oxygenated blood into the heart's main  
pumping chamber. In prolapse, the valve's two flaps for some reason 
become elongated and floppy, and some blood leaks backward when the 
chamber contracts to pump out blood. Major leakage can cause 
serious problems, but those are rare. 
</P>
<P>
	The diagnosis has unnecessarily frightened healthy patients,  
barred them from jobs such as flying airplanes and increased health 
insurance premiums for many, said Dr. Robert Levine, a professor of 
medicine at Harvard Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
	Early research found suspiciously high numbers of people had  
mitral valve prolapse. Cardiologists had no standard criteria for 
how much deviation in valve position and thickness constituted 
prolapse, they wrongly believed normal valves were shaped like 
saucers and their research subjects generally were people with 
symptoms that drove them to major hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Levine and colleagues eventually determined the valves are  
shaped like saddles and established specific criteria for 
diagnosing prolapse from cardiac ultrasounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Using those criteria, Benjamin's team re-examined ultrasounds  
from 3,491 men and women participating in the Framingham Heart 
Study, a long-running study of volunteers from a Boston suburb. 
Benjamin found only 2.4 percent, or 84 people, had the condition; 
just five had serious complications. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Levine found only 2 percent of 213 stroke patients  
under 45 that he examined had prolapse vs. 40 percent in early 
studies. Levine's rate was about the same as in a stroke-free 
comparison group. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers now must discover which of the 5 million-plus  
Americans with prolapse will develop dangerous complications.

<HEADLINE> Ducks Sign Kariya to Rich Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The Mighty Ducks' Paul Kariya, who sat  
out part of one season because of a contract dispute, has signed a 
new three-year deal believed to be worth at least $10 million 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial terms of the contract were not made public, but an NHL  
source said the agreement was for between $32 million and $33 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kariya, a first-team NHL All-Star three of the past four years,  
made $8.5 million last season in the final year of a two-year 
contract. He had missed 32 games before finally signing that 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	This time he was amazed at the speed of the negotiations.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy with the deal,'' Kariya said Wednesday at a  
news conference at Edison Field, up the street from the Mighty 
Ducks' home ice. ``It went so smoothly it kind of caught me off 
guard how quickly it got done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kariya, 24, said he got a call from his agent a day earlier  
saying the negotiations were complete. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had basically told him at the end of the season that getting  
this done was his deal, that I wanted to focus on getting ready for 
next season,'' said Kariya, who had 39 goals and 62 assists for 
Anaheim last season. He was named a first-team NHL All-Star last 
week after finishing third in NHL scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he ever thought that he might leave the Mighty Ducks,  
Kariya smiled and replied: ``No. In my heart, I've always known I 
will be here. I love it here, and I can't imagine a better place to 
play hockey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Ducks general manager Pierre Gauthier: ``It's great to  
never get into a situation where Paul was a free agent. He wanted 
to stay and we wanted to keep him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously it is a big day for the franchise. We want to build  
this club to become a Stanley Cup contender and a Stanley Cup 
champion, and this is a significant step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mighty Ducks have never made it beyond the second round of  
the playoffs, and lost to Detroit in the opening series this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kariya, however, believes the team is on the verge of a  
breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel within three years we will be Stanley Cup contenders,''  
he said, alluding to the length of his contract. ``I think we have 
a lot of potential with our young players, and you will see them 
improve with more experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we want, all every player wants, is the opportunity to  
have a chance to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kariya broke his foot in the playoff series against Detroit this  
year, but said it is healing and that he expects to begin skating 
again in August, which is his normal routine. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Vancouver, Kariya was Anaheim's first NHL entry  
draft pick as they took him fourth overall in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He and linemate Teemu Selanne have provided the Mighty Ducks one  
of the league's highest-scoring duos. 
</P>
<P>
	Kariya has 168 goals and 210 assists in his five years in  
Anaheim, despite missing the first third of the 1997-98 season due 
to the contract dispute and most of the rest of that season due to 
a concussion.

<HEADLINE> Dominion Resources' Purchase OKd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Shareholders of Dominion Resources Inc. and  
Consolidated Natural Gas Co. overwhelming approved a $6.4 billion 
deal that will create one of the nation's largest natural gas and 
electric companies. 
</P>
<P>
	At a special shareholder's meeting in Richmond on Wednesday, 99  
percent of Dominion Resources' voting shareholders favored the 
merger, the company said. A similar meeting in Tarrytown, N.Y., 
found 98 percent support for the merger among CNG shareholders who 
voted, the tabulators said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, to be called Dominion Resources, will have its  
headquarters in Richmond and maintain a significant presence in 
CNG's Pittsburgh headquarters, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies recently announced a joint venture to construct  
four natural gas-fired electric generating units in West Virginia, 
Ohio and Pennsylvania. Other joint initiatives are being 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominion Resources, the parent company of Virginia Power, is  
involved in regulated and competitive electric power, natural gas 
and oil development. CNG is one of the country's largest producers, 
transporters, distributors and retail marketers of natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will have about 4 million retail customers  
in five states -- Virginia, North Carolina, West Virginia, Ohio and 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Dominion Resources fell 56 1/4 cents to $43.31 1/4, while  
shares of CNG rose $43 3/4 cents to $60.75 on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> SNS Closes Radio-Internet Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- States News Service has closed the part of its  
operation that gathered news across the country for radio and the 
Internet. It took the move after learning some contributors were 
persistently pirating Associated Press material, Leland Schwartz, 
SNS president and editor, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The service lost its only radio client, the ABC NewsWire, a  
product of the radio division of ABC News, as a result of the 
discovery, he said. The material also was distributed by Reuters to 
Internet Web sites and portals. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz said some part-time radio stringers were ``misusing AP  
copy in complete violation of our policy or our sense of 
fairness.'' In the worst cases, he said, they ``lifted parts or all 
of AP's news summaries and used them as their own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An ABC spokeswoman, Julie Hoover, said, ``We don't comment on  
our business decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The service employed 10 broadcast editors in Washington and used  
65 to 75 part-time stringers around the country. Schwartz said the 
move does not affect the company's core operation, 25 years old, of 
reporting Washington news of regional interest to newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	AP monitored the published reports of States News Service and  
notified the parties of copyright violations and misappropriation 
issues related to AP's intellectual property. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are exploring legal action against any parties who took or  
used AP information without a license to do so,'' said James R. 
Williams III, vice president and director of AP's broadcast 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz said after AP pointed out misuse of its written radio  
news reports earlier this year ``we made every attempt to make sure 
the stringers understood the rules, let alone journalistic 
honesty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, a handful of them Janet Cooked us out of this  
business,'' he said. He was referring to the Washington Post 
reporter who fabricated stories that won a 1981 Pulitzer Prize, 
later withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz said the company could not effectively control the way  
its state news stories outside Washington were collected unless it 
switched to a full-time staff. The 4-year-old service ceased 
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Statement From Federal Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Following is the statement released by the Federal Reserve  
announcing its quarter-point increase in the federal funds rate on 
Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Open Market Committee today voted to raise its  
target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5 percent. 
Last fall, the committee reduced interest rates to counter a 
significant seizing-up of financial markets in the United States. 
Since then much of the financial strain has eased, foreign 
economies have firmed and economic activity in the United States 
has moved forward at a brisk pace. Accordingly, the full degree of 
adjustment is judged no longer necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor markets have continued to tighten over recent quarters,  
but strengthening productivity growth has contained inflationary 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Owing to the uncertain resolution of the balance of conflicting  
forces in the economy going forward, the FOMC has chosen to adopt a 
directive that includes no predilection about near-term policy 
action. The committee, nonetheless, recognizes that in the current 
dynamic environment it must be especially alert to the emergence, 
or potential emergence, of inflationary forces that could undermine 
economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Arlington Hails Vet Who Donated Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALEM, Va. (AP) -- Roger Hedgbeth was a World War II hero and  
veteran's advocate with two final wishes: to have his body donated 
to medical research and his ashes interred at Arlington National 
Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife Linnae honored the first wish, but could not honor the  
second because his remains were not returned and Arlington refused 
to memorialize him without them. 
</P>
<P>
	But because of the tenacity of widow, Hedgbeth will get the  
memorial he hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfair to penalize someone who did two selfless things,  
serve his country and donate his body to science,'' U.S. Rep. Bob 
Goodlatte said Wednesday in announcing the exception. 
</P>
<P>
	Hedgbeth died in 1997 the day after his 77th birthday, and had  
wanted his ashes placed behind an engraved stone in the Arlington 
columbarium, a vault with niches for urns. 
</P>
<P>
	Any honorably discharged veteran who is not a convicted felon  
can get a niche. Decorated veterans and soldiers whose remains 
could not be recovered, including those missing in action, are 
eligible for freestanding memorials, McLendon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hedgbeth more than met the requirements for the columbarium.  
</P>
<P>
	He was an Army sniper who won the Bronze Star for bravery during  
the Battle of the Bulge, was given five ribbons of commendation and 
got to meet Sir Winston Churchill and Gen. George C. Patton. 
</P>
<P>
	His proudest moment, however, was when the German city that he  
helped the Allies capture made him mayor for a day. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hedgbeth did not know that in donating his body to science,  
the remains are never returned. And Arlington had a policy of not 
providing niches in the vault without having the cremated bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodlatte, a Republican, said Wednesday that Arlington agreed to  
make an exception in Hedgbeth's case. His name will be etched in 
stone in front of an empty niche in the columbarium. 
</P>
<P>
	And Goodlatte said he will work to pass legislation pending in a  
committee that would make Hedgbeth's exception the rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did everything he could for veterans, even in his spare  
time,'' said Corky Caughlin, a friend and former vice president of 
the veterans council. ``You couldn't meet a nicer guy.''

<HEADLINE> Theater in Kenya Struggles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Tony Njuguna, one of Kenya's most famous  
actors, was meeting his public -- schoolgirls in green pleated 
skirts. But it wasn't his performance that night in ``Bedside 
Manners'' or his distinguished acting career that had them 
squealing. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his toothpaste commercials.  
</P>
<P>
	``Crest!'' the schoolgirls screamed, mobbing Njuguna in the  
theater lobby one recent Friday night as though he was Brad Pitt or 
Tom Cruise. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike Pitt, Cruise and other American stars, acting is  
neither easy nor is it a full-time job in Kenya, even for the 
handful of well-known stars like Njuguna. 
</P>
<P>
	Njuguna is one of the few nationally known faces here, and  
that's only because of his work on TV commercials. The other stars 
of ``Bedside Manners,'' a farce written by Briton Derek Benfield 
about two pairs of unfaithful spouses who end up in the same hotel, 
work during the day as travel agents and advertising consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	Locally made theater, television and film are nearly nonexistent  
in Kenya, where movie theaters show year-old American and Indian 
films and television is filled with professional wrestling, 
evangelical preachers and episodes of ``The Bold and the 
Beautiful'' from the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	With no drama schools, no college acting programs, not a dime of  
government funding and no tradition of private donations for the 
arts, theater in Kenya is limping along. 
</P>
<P>
	Performance halls built by British colonialists have been looted  
or made into parking lots, and white theater troupes have slowly 
disbanded since Kenya gained independence in 1963 and whites began 
trickling from the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phoenix Players, the country's only full-time theater group,  
performs ``Bedside Manners'' at the Professional Centre in what 
looks like an American high school auditorium or an 
off-off-Broadway space at best. Its 120 vinyl-backed chairs are 
crammed into a basement with busted lights. Little signs are taped 
to the flimsy sets to make sure the audience understands what they 
are. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like when people are little they play the good fairy  
and say, `Mummy, I want to be an actor when I grow up,''' said 
James Falkland, a British-born Kenyan actor and director who 
co-founded the Phoenix in 1983. ``What's the point of having a 
drama school if there's no industry for them to go into?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the fat lady hasn't sung yet. With the demise of the  
European-run theaters, many see the beginning of something new and 
truly Kenyan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenyan society is slowly opening up. In 1992, the country  
revived its multiparty political system, and the following year 
tossed out a colonial-era law requiring artists to have a 
government license to show their work. 
</P>
<P>
	Slowly, Kenyan actors are surfacing.  
</P>
<P>
	On weekends, actors have started putting on little plays in  
small hotels, restaurants and bars on the outskirts of Nairobi, 
shoving aside tables and chairs to make a stage. The plays touch on 
issues like government corruption and AIDS, and are frequently 
ribald. All this would have been highly risky less than a decade 
ago under government censorship. 
</P>
<P>
	The playlets are frequently in the Kikuyu language -- a notable  
change since performances in local languages were particularly 
censored under colonial rulers and then under the single-party rule 
of the Kenyan African National Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the British and KANU leaders were more tolerant of  
performances in English and Swahili, assuming the well-educated 
audiences were already accustomed to dissident art and were too 
small to launch a rebellion. It was the masses they were worried 
about. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past few years, small theater troupes have been founded  
for the first time. But even the best-known, like the Nyungu 
Cultural Club and the Mhalamwezi Players. perform to very small 
audiences, and just about everyone in the room is Kenyan. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 Kenyans recently turned out at the Nyungu club for a  
one-man show about different versions of the Creation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in the crowd of mostly well-dressed yuppies laughed and  
others nodded off as the performer danced, drummed and spoke in 
Swahili and English about how progress has brought human beings no 
closer to knowing why they were created. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilda Obyerodhyambo, who runs the troupe, said it will take a  
major shift in Kenya's cultural mindset for theater to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	For most of the hundreds of thousands of people who have  
migrated to the city from rural Kenya since independence, she said, 
performance was something informal that just broke out in public 
spaces and at family get-togethers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Africans aren't accustomed to paying for performance'' or art,  
she said. ``People say, `Why should I pay $230 for that painting? 
Why don't you just give it to me?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Falkland says he's been predicting this theater drought since he  
came to Kenya in 1970, and that white troupe leaders refused to 
invest in locals. They didn't think it was possible, he said, for 
Kenyans to put on a production like ``Bedside Manners,'' which was 
performed by an all-Kenyan cast. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you suggested this 10 years ago at a muzungu cocktail party  
they would have laughed at you,'' he said. Muzungu is Swahili for 
white person. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenyans are being exposed to all kinds of performance art and  
there's no reason they should be limited to doing tribal dances 
outside mud huts, Falkland said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Culture is not a static thing. It keeps changing to suit the  
society as it changes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Growing Kenyan theater is important to young people, at least to  
more than 200 of them who showed up at the Professional Centre over 
a recent weekend to try out for a few spots in the Phoenix's fall 
production of ``Cinderella.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among them was Saaqut Wagana.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to do something from the inside,'' the 24-year-old  
said, making a motion with his hands of something coming up from 
the depths of his gut. ``For me, it's do or die.''

<HEADLINE> Boston's Valentin Put On DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Red Sox third baseman John Valentin was  
placed on the 15-day disabled list Wednesday after being hit in the 
head by a pitch Friday by Chicago White Sox starter John Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentin underwent an MRI Monday which revealed he has a small  
bruise on the front of his brain, according to team doctor Arthur 
Pappas. Although Valentin has felt no dizziness since last weekend, 
Pappas said he is at risk if he is hit by another pitch. Valentin 
will have another MRI in about 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was made retroactive to June 26.  
</P>
<P>
	Valentin is hitting .251 with seven homers and 44 RBIs in 67  
games. The Red Sox recalled third baseman Wilton Veras from 
Double-A Trenton of the Eastern League to replace Valentin on the 
roster.

<HEADLINE> Science Study Will Create Fireworks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two NASA science rockets next month will  
create a celestial fireworks show that may be seen up to 400 miles 
away from the Wallops Island, Va., launch site. 
</P>
<P>
	A powdered chemical that burns brightly as it comes into contact  
with oxygen will be released from a rocket into space between 43 
miles and 96 miles above the Earth. The glowing chemical will 
become a spreading, corkscrew-shaped cloud of light that is 
expected to shine for up to 20 minutes and then slowly fade. 
</P>
<P>
	Miguel F. Larsen, a professor of physics at Cornell University  
and a principal scientist for the study, said the chemical will 
burn with a pearly white intensity and should be visible, in ideal 
conditions, for 400 miles in any direction from Wallops Island. 
</P>
<P>
	This means that if the weather is clear, the glowing cloud might  
be sighted as far south as Myrtle Beach, S.C., and as far north as 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	To observers near Wallops Island, the cloud will appear to be  
almost directly overhead. With greater separation of the observer, 
the cloud will appear closer and closer to the horizon until it is 
blocked from view by the curvature of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Just when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will  
launch the rockets will depend on the weather and conditions in the 
ionosphere, Larsen said. Launch could come at any time between 9:30 
p.m. to 4 a.m. EDT each night from July 2 to July 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Larsen said the chemical, 6 pounds of powdered  
trimethylaluminum, will burn ``in a pearly white color'' that will 
be dispersed slowly by winds into a spiral-like cloud and then 
disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much oxygen that high up, so it will burn  
slowly,'' said Larsen. 
</P>
<P>
	The experiment includes a rocket carrying the chemical and a  
second rocket carrying instruments that measure electrical fields 
and charged particles in the ionosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	The experiment will be conducted twice, with a pair of rockets  
launched each time. 
</P>
<P>
	Larsen said ground instruments will be observing the burning  
chemical cloud to determine the direction and velocity of winds. 
</P>
<P>
	By combining the wind observations with the measurements from  
instruments on the other rocket, scientists hope to understand more 
about a layer of the ionosphere about 60 miles up that can disrupt 
or degrade satellite communications.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Launches Poland Recall </HEADLINE>

<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Coca-Cola today expanded the second major  
recall of its products in Europe, withdrawing small glass bottles 
of its beverages off shelves in Poland and replacing them with 
plastic containers. 
</P>
<P>
	The soft-drink giant described the measure as a safety  
precaution after mold was found in some bottles of carbonated 
mineral water. Its news release contained no figures on the exact 
number of returnable 12-ounce glass bottles involved in the recall. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said consumers could trade in the small bottles of  
Coca-Cola beverages in return for larger plastic containers -- about 
16 ounces -- of the same product. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's announcement came hours after Coca-Cola said it was  
withdrawing hundreds of thousands of glass bottles of Bonaqua brand 
carbonated water from Polish stores. The move came only weeks after 
some Coke products were ordered off shelves in Belgium, when some 
200 people became sick after drinking beverages made by the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcin Barcz, Coca-Cola's deputy director for Poland, said  
health inspectors detected mold in 1,500 glass bottles of the 
mineral water. He said tests showed the glass bottles were the 
source of the mold, which was first detected by a consumer in 
Gdansk. 
</P>
<P>
	Testing of all Coca-Cola products showed that 99.6 percent of  
beverages in the small, returnable bottles was untainted, said Ron 
Pugsley, director-general of Coca-Cola Poland Beverages. 
</P>
<P>
	Barcz described the mold as ``not dangerous for the health,''  
but state health inspectors said it could cause digestive problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Coca-Cola said about 14 million cases, each  
containing 24 eight-ounce servings, were affected by the product 
recall in Belgium. Coke products were allowed back into stores last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The exact cause of the sickness is still not known. But the  
company acknowledged that its plant in Antwerp, Belgium, used 
substandard carbon dioxide to inject bubbles into bottled drinks 
and that a fungicide on wooden pallets at the Dunkirk, France, 
plant may have caused a foul smell on some cans. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, the Belgian Health Ministry said today that the  
wave of illnesses among school children who drank Coke may have 
been partly psychological, with some students imagining they were 
ill after other children developed symptoms of nausea and 
dizziness. 
</P>
<P>
	A report by the ministry found that, in four of the five schools  
where children said they fell ill after drinking Coke, only half 
had actually consumed the beverage before developing the symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	The report's conclusions were based on examinations by ministry  
medical experts of 112 students who fell ill in five schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlanta, Coca-Cola said today that the health scare in Europe  
over some Coke products, combined with continued economic problems 
in other overseas markets, would hurt its second-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide unit case volume will be down 1 to 2 percent for the  
quarter, with a decline of 6 to 7 percent expected in Coke's 
Greater Europe Group, the company said. Unit case volume is an 
industry measure representing 24 eight-ounce servings sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola said it hopes to recover volume in Europe through  
special promotions. But earnings per share for the quarter ending 
today will ``reflect the loss of sales in several key markets,'' 
the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	It said worldwide gallon sales also are expected to decline  
slightly for the quarter.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women Soccer Face More Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANDOVER, Md. (AP) -- There were few anxious moments for the  
American team in the first round of the Women's World Cup. Now, 
anxiety is a frequent companion. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Americans aren't exactly nervous wrecks as they  
prepare for Thursday's quarterfinals game with Germany -- the loser 
goes home, the victor meets the winner of Brazil-Nigeria in the 
semifinals on July 4 -- there's an edge that didn't exist during 
their first-round sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	``When teams get to the knockout rounds, they know one mistake  
can be the difference,'' said Shannon MacMillan, whose goal and two 
assists against North Korea catapulted the United States into the 
second round. ``So it's not as relaxed as a three-game round-robin. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're also facing the better teams as you move on. You have  
to step up the level of play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Tony DiCicco fully expects his players will do that.  
Unlike in men's play, in which a close game between the United 
States and Germany is considered a victory for the Americans, the 
American women are 8-3-1 against the Germans. The Americans are 
well-rested and relatively injury free, although star forward Mia 
Hamm has been practicing with an ice bag on her hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just a precautionary measure,'' DiCicco said. ``We have some  
players who have some bruises and are a little beat up. At this 
point in the tournament, if any of them feel anything, we put some 
ice on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way they joke with each other and are at ease with the media  
and fans hasn't changed as the stakes get higher. The players are 
enjoying their time in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	But, to a woman, the American veterans readily mention the  
memory of the 1995 World Cup loss to Norway in the semifinals. The 
fact they keep that defeat alive in their minds -- and take it with 
them when they go onto the field -- is proof, they claim, that they 
take their mission very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the worst feeling I've ever had in soccer and I will  
never forget it,'' Michelle Akers said. ``There's a difference 
between being focused and being centered. We were distracted in 
some ways in '95, but at gametime we were focused on the task. But 
we were not centered, balanced, able to respond to what was going 
on during the game. You have to be centered to take everything that 
comes at you and play your level of ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So the anxiety players are feeling might be a good thing?  
</P>
<P>
	``Sure,'' Akers said. ``For this World Cup, our attitude is,  
`Come on, bring it on.' We'll be able to take everything in and 
still play our game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which means not letting the technically strong Germans control  
the pace, which they will slow if they can. Germany, which finished 
second to Norway in 1995, also will try to free midfielder Bettina 
Wiegmann to set up forwards Brigit Prinz and Inka Grings. 
</P>
<P>
	In turn, the Americans will need an edge in possession,  
particularly in the midfield. 
</P>
<P>
	The Germans skipped their final practice to go to dinner in  
Georgetown on Wednesday night. There isn't nearly the pressure on 
them to win as there is on the host team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think about the pressure,'' Julie Foudy said. ``We  
think about the reward.''

<HEADLINE> Flyers, Lindros Agree on Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Less than 10 hours before Eric Lindros was  
to become a restricted free agent, the Philadelphia Flyers 
announced Wednesday the signing of their franchise center to a 
one-year contract extension worth $8.5 million plus incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract puts in writing what Lindros and the club had  
agreed to by handshake in September. Despite repeatedly assuring 
fans they would get the deal done, they waited to make it official 
until the day before a July 1 deadline for clubs to sign their 
potential restricted free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL said it could not officially recognize the gentleman's  
agreement between Lindros and the team until it was in writing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eric signed the contract and returned it to us,'' Flyers  
general manager Bob Clarke said. ``We signed it (Wednesday) morning 
... It's all done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The handshake deal was reached before the start of the regular  
season, after the two sides could not agree on terms for a 
five-year extension. At the time, Lindros said the one-year deal 
would eliminate the distraction of having contract negotiations go 
on during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros' father and agent, Carl, said on June 4 that his son  
would indeed sign the one-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Lindros has declined to detail what incentives were  
included in the contract except to say they were performance-based 
and team-oriented, such as if the Flyers won or reached the Stanley 
Cup finals. They are similar to incentives proposed by the team in 
their five-year contract offer last year, Lindros' father said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Wednesday's deal leads to new talks on a longer-term  
deal remains to be seen. Neither side has offered a timeline on 
getting that done. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Lindroses are interested we would like to sit down with  
them later and see if we can get a longer contract,'' Clarke said. 
``If not, then Eric would be a restricted free agent at the end of 
this season.''

<HEADLINE> Government Outlines Electronic Check Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans would be able to receive Social  
Security and other federal benefit payments electronically, under a 
low-cost account program outlined by Vice President Al Gore today. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, spoke about the program at an event in New York and  
offered final details on the plan which was proposed by the 
Treasury Department last year, following the mandates of a 1996 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounts would be available to anyone who receives a federal  
benefit -- from Social Security and veterans benefits to federal 
employee pensions -- Gore said in a statement released by his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	The payments would be electronically transferred from the  
government into the low-cost accounts. Tax refunds, however, are 
not included. 
</P>
<P>
	The program is designed to particularly help the several million  
Americans who, for various reasons, currently don't have bank 
accounts and now receive federal benefit payments in the mail. The 
program could reduce the risk of these government checks getting 
stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department has been encouraging federally insured  
banks, savings institutions and credit unions to voluntarily set up 
low-cost accounts to accept the electronically transferred federal 
benefit payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore listed the first financial institutions to have preliminary  
agreements to offer the low-cost accounts: Banco Popular de Puerto 
Rico &AMP; NA; Bank of America; Britton &AMP; Koontz First National Bank; 
Chase Manhattan Bank; Washington State Bank; and Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, the government pays each institution a one-time  
per-account fee to set up an account. The program is being offered 
only through federally insured financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The program is believed to save the government money in the  
long-run as people switch over to the electronic payment system. 
That would reduce the government's costs for mailing and printing 
benefit checks. 
</P>
<P>
	People who have the accounts would be subject to a maximum fee  
of $3 a month. Account holders would have a minimum of four cash 
withdrawals and four balance inquiries each month -- either from 
tellers or through automated teller machines -- that would be 
covered by the $3 fee. The accounts would be subject to the same 
consumer protections that the financial institutions make available 
to other account holders. 
</P>
<P>
	There would be no minimum balance -- except as required by  
federal or state law -- and account holders would get monthly 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	It's up to the financial institutions to decide whether or not  
to pay interest on account balances. 
</P>
<P>
	Many banks, S&AMP;Ls and credit unions already offer low-cost  
checking accounts. But for a variety of reasons, including fear of 
stiff bounced-check fees, an estimated 8 million Americans have no 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 requires most  
federal payments, except for tax refunds, to eventually be made by 
electronic transfers. An exemption is available to people if an 
electronic deposit would cause a hardship.

<HEADLINE> Bush Shatters Fund-Raising Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush raised more than $36 million in  
the first half of 1999, shattering political fund-raising records 
and shocking the less fortunate field of Republican rivals chasing 
the surging front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	The remarkable total, which caught Republican and Democratic  
operatives by surprise, is nearly 10 times as much as his closest 
Republican rival and twice as much as Vice President Al Gore, who 
has only one Democratic rival and the power of the White House 
political machine behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who already holds an overwhelming lead in Republican  
polls, is virtually certain to forgo federal matching money in the 
primary season, aides said Wednesday. The historic step would put 
him at a great advantage in the Republican primary season and 
potentially help him if he wins the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am humbled by the response,'' Bush said. ``I am, as you can  
imagine, amazed at the outpouring of support. This is a campaign 
that has got a wide range of people who are willing to help people 
from all around the country. I'm gratified and that's that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, appearing somewhat overwhelmed by the reports, was asked  
how he explained the record fund-raising. ``A wonderful 
personality,'' he replied. ``Seriously, that's what the pundits are 
going to have to figure out. I've got a lot of friends ... people 
are hungry for something. It's beyond expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush campaign said it had raised $28.3 million in the second  
quarter of 1999, bringing its fund-raising total for the first half 
of the year to $36,250,000. That surpasses the $32 million that 
1996 GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole raised for his entire 
campaign. Bush did it in less than four months. 
</P>
<P>
	He received contributions from more than 75,000 individuals -- 30  
percent of them in Texas -- with an average donation of $480. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the support of Bush reflects a deep desire on the part of  
many Republicans to get a candidate they think is viable and able 
to win,'' said Herbert Alexander, professor emeritus of political 
science at the University of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Bush does by raising this money is squeeze out these  
other candidates, who now will find it difficult to find 
contributors,'' Alexander said. ``Bush seems to have canvassed the 
Republican neighborhood and done very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush leads the other Republican candidates in the polls and has  
more money than the rest of the GOP field combined. The closest GOP 
rival to Bush, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, raised just $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore reported raising $18.2 million to $18.5 during the first  
half of 1999. Asked about Bush's take, he said Wednesday, ``I am 
grateful to those who have helped me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans will always do better than Democrats'' in raising  
money, he said, citing the 1996 presidential race, when Republican 
took in more money than Democrats ``but our ideas and policies had 
more support from the American people. And that will be the case 
again this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His only rival for the Democratic presidential nomination,  
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, reported raising more than 
$11.5 million, closing the gap a bit on Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of Bush's record-setting pace, Bush's political team  
plans to talk at the end of this week with the chief fund-raisers 
in every state, seeking estimates of how much they think they can 
take in during the last half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	That will be the first of several meetings in the coming days  
that will be used to determine whether Bush accepts federal funds 
to help finance his primary campaign. Bush said in California that 
he had not decided yet, but that his first six months haul ``makes 
it a lot easier decision.'' Aides, speaking on the condition of 
anonymity, said he was virtually certain to decide against taking 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Forgoing matching funds would allow Bush to ignore federal  
campaign spending limits. If he chooses that route, his campaign is 
likely to be criticized by opponents arguing that the action defies 
the spirit of campaign reform laws that date to post-Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he has never considered forgoing the matching money,  
``I support the system of campaign finance reform and I think our 
reforms should go further,'' Gore said, signaling a potential line 
of attack against Bush should they face each other in the general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes, one of Bush's GOP rivals, is not accepting federal  
funds. He spent $37.5 million of his own money on his unsuccessful 
1996 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes campaign manager Bill Dal Col said Bush should return the  
contributions he has received from political action committees and 
Washington lobbyists. Bush raised $1 million last week at a 
lobbyist-studded D.C. fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	``He clearly has a lot of support from Washington lobbyists and  
the establishment political class,'' Dal Col said. ``Let him return 
the special interest money and put the rumors of his ties to that 
community behind him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, doing without matching funds would enable Bush to  
raise and spend money in the months between clinching the 
nomination and the national political conventions. In 1996, Dole 
was up against the spending limits and could not respond while 
President Clinton spent millions of dollars on commercials 
attacking him. 
</P>
<P>
	The other Republican candidates trailed far behind Bush, Gore  
and Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain was next with $4.1 million, plus another $2 million  
transferred from his Senate campaign account. ``In the non-Bush 
regional, we're leading,'' campaign spokesman Howard Opinsky said.

<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Irish-bred Perugino Bay, making his  
U.S. debut, won Wednesday's $56,400 feature race on the turf at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Perugino Bay, ridden by Kent Desormeaux, beat American Spirit by  
a head, then survived a foul claim by Isaias Enriquez, who was on 
Bristolville. 
</P>
<P>
	Enriquez, whose mount finished a head back in third, claimed the  
winner had drifted out in the final yards and impeded his horse, 
but the stewards disallowed the claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Perugino Bay, who carried 117 pounds, was timed in 1:40 4-5 for  
the 1 1-16 miles on the grass. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner paid $25.20, $12 and $7.20. American Spirit, ridden  
by David Flores and carrying 118, paid $4.80 and $3.80. The show 
payoff on Bristolville, the high weight at 120, was $5.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Perugino Bay had a 2-2-4 record before being shipped to the  
United States.

<HEADLINE> Berger Funds Founder Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- William M.B. Berger, the white-bearded founder of  
the Berger Funds, died yesterday after battling congestive heart 
trouble. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger came from a long line of bankers. His grandfather founded  
the Colorado National Bank in 1862. At age 26, Berger began 
managing a $100 million stock portfolio for the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger discovered the Centennial Fund, the first tax-free  
exchange fund, in 1960. It allowed investors to trade their shares 
of stock for shares of the fund without incurring a tax liability. 
Then the Internal Revenue Service changed its rules to stop the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1966, he merged his Centennial Management Co. with Founders  
before starting the funds that bear his name eight years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his real contribution was in educating people about  
the importance about investing and saving,'' said Berger 
spokeswoman Sally Carleton. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger was born in Denver on Nov. 3, 1925. He earned a degree in  
English at Yale University after interrupting his studies to drive 
an ambulance for the British 8th Army in Europe during World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
	At 6 feet 6 inches, Berger wore a beard that reminded some of  
Santa Claus. In addition to his own commercials, Berger made 
appearances on Wall Street Week and on several of CNBC's financial 
talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger was an art collector who once compared his acquisitions  
to making investments. 
</P>
<P>
	``You buy things that nobody else understands. You hear people  
say, `What's that crazy guy doing?' I have great faith in my 
judgment,'' he said during an interview in 1997 when his art 
collection was put on display at the Denver Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Bernadette, 59, of Denver; and four  
children: William B. Berger, 47, of Paris; George B. Berger, 45, of 
Denver; M. Mermaid, 42, of London; and Katherine Berger, 37, of 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were not available.

<HEADLINE> Hubbell Pleas End Arkansas Phase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the day the independent counsel law  
expired, Kenneth Starr wrapped up the Whitewater phase of his 
investigation Wednesday with guilty pleas from presidential friend 
Webster Hubbell and declared he's seeking an ``orderly conclusion'' 
to the rest of his work. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell, the former No. 3 Justice Department official, was  
sentenced to a year of probation after pleading guilty to a broadly 
worded felony charge that accused him of concealing his and first 
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's legal work on a fraudulent Arkansas 
land project. 
</P>
<P>
	That deal with Starr averted possible testimony by the first  
lady at his trial, which had been scheduled to begin Aug. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell also pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of failing to  
pay income tax in a deal that dropped tax charges against his wife, 
his accountant and his tax attorney as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``After five years, it's over. The office of independent counsel  
has finally agreed to leave me, my family and my friends alone. And 
our lives can begin again,'' Hubbell said outside the federal 
courthouse. He also said Mrs. Clinton did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said the guilty pleas ended the Arkansas phase of his  
five-year investigation that looked at the Clintons' Whitewater 
real estate investment and other business and private dealings. He 
said he was trying to wrap up other aspects in an ``orderly 
fashion'' but that a federal grand jury was still looking into 
certain allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr declined to be more specific, but legal sources familiar  
with the investigation, speaking only on condition of anonymity, 
said those allegations involve: 
</P>
<P>
	--The 1993 purge of the White House travel office and whether  
Mrs. Clinton directed the firings. She says she did not. 
</P>
<P>
	--Maryland developer and Democratic Party contributor Nathan  
Landow. A recently released FBI polygraph report says presidential 
accuser Kathleen Willey has alleged that Landow suggested possible 
testimony she could give in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. 
Landow denies doing anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton aides cheered the end of the Whitewater inquiry as  
evidence that neither of the Clintons would be charged with 
wrongdoing. They also expressed sympathy for Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president and first lady recognize that these past few  
years have been very difficult ones for Webb and Suzy Hubbell, and 
they hope that this resolution will allow the Hubbells to move on 
to a brighter future,'' said presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	At Hubbell's sentencing that immediately followed his guilty  
pleas, Starr acknowledged that incessant criticism of his $40 
million investigation played a role in his decision to reach a deal 
with the former associate attorney general. He told U.S. District 
Judge James Robertson that the controversy had ``found its way into 
the hearts and minds of prospective jurors'' and could have 
affected Hubbell's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr also cited the end of the independent counsel law, which  
expired Wednesday because Congress did not renew it. Under a 
grandfather clause, Starr can keep investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's efforts have resulted in convictions of 14 people --  
including the Clintons' Whitewater business partners James and 
Susan McDougal and then-Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker -- and led to 
the president's impeachment last winter on charges related to the 
Monica Lewinsky affair. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	But the prosecutor could never build a criminal case against the  
Clintons on the original allegations that prompted the Whitewater 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had planned at Hubbell's trial to show that he  
engaged in a scheme to conceal work he and the first lady had done 
on a fraudulent land deal involving the failed savings and loan at 
the center of the Whitewater case. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell pleaded guilty to the broad charge of ``cover up by  
scheme'' documented by 85 paragraphs of allegations in the 
indictment. But the only specific violation he admitted to in the 
plea agreement was failing to disclose a potential conflict of 
interest to federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	After pleading guilty, Hubbell went out of his way to tell  
reporters, ``Mrs. Clinton did nothing wrong. ... What I pleaded to 
has nothing to do with Mrs. Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Hubbell's characterization was correct, Starr  
said, ``No,'' and later issued a news release saying the guilty 
plea concerned Hubbell and ``Hillary Rodham Clinton's 
relationship'' with the fraudulent land development. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, prosecutors sought no jail time,  
restitution or fine. Hubbell previously served a 16-month prison 
sentence for bilking his law firm and his clients. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arkansas land development, called Castle Grande, was owned  
by James McDougal and Hubbell's father-in-law, Seth Ward, and 
federal regulators said it was riddled with sham transactions. Bank 
examiners said it cost the failing savings and loan owned by 
McDougal $3.8 million and contributed to the institution's 
insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax evasion indictment that led to Hubbell's misdemeanor  
plea, Hubbell was accused in part with failing to declare as income 
$74,000 of more than $450,000 in fees from 15 employers in 1994, 
when top Clinton advisers arranged consulting contracts for him 
from Vernon Jordan and other close friends of President Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Gymboree Jeans for Kids Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURLINGAME, Calif. (AP) -- About 7,000 pairs of jeans for boys  
have been voluntarily recalled because the waist snap comes off and 
poses a possible choking hazard. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> NHL Drops Puck on Free-Agent Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In this era of tough defenses and low-scoring games in the NHL,  
what is a 40-goal scorer worth? 
</P>
<P>
	Theo Fleury gets to test the prospect with the opening of the  
NHL free-agent market today. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury, who scored 93 points in the 1998-99 season, is among the  
highest-profile players in a crop of unrestricted free agents. He 
scored 10 of his 40 goals in just 15 games after his trade from 
Calgary to Colorado near the end of the season, considerably 
raising his value. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury figures to be one of the big winners this summer. He is  
expected to dramatically raise the reported $2.4 million salary he 
earned last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Such players as Colorado's Valeri Kamensky, Joe Juneau of  
Buffalo and Pat Verbeek of the Stanley Cup champion Dallas Stars 
are also available among the unrestricted free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	They can sign with any team in the NHL without compensation to  
their former team. A player whose contract has expired becomes an 
unrestricted free agent at the age of 32, as long he has four years 
of NHL experience. 
</P>
<P>
	The restricted free agents are something else. To sign such a  
player, the compensation is high: up to five first-round draft 
choices, depending on the amount of salary offered the player. In 
this case, the former team also has the right to match the offer 
sheet presented to the player. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's group of restricted free agents includes forwards  
Jarome Iginla of Calgary, Keith Primeau of Carolina, Bill Guerin of 
Edmonton and Miroslav Satan of Buffalo, and defensemen Nicklas 
Lidstrom of Detroit, Wade Redden of Ottawa and Bryan Berard of 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim's Paul Kariya and Philadelphia's Eric Lindros, two of  
the league's premier players, were taken out of the mix when they 
re-signed with their respective teams just before the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	It should otherwise be open season for NHL teams looking for  
that key player who could push them over the top, like Brett Hull 
did for the Stars after coming over from St. Louis last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury has been reportedly targeted by the New York Rangers.  
Wayne Gretzky, who retired at the end of the season after playing 
three years in New York, said he recently did some lobbying with 
Fleury for his former team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's up to the Rangers,'' Gretzky added.  
</P>
<P>
	Some of the other unrestricted free agents available: defensemen  
Ulf Samuelsson and Mark Tinordi of Atlanta; forwards Wendel Clark 
of Detroit, Ray Sheppard of Carolina, Colorado's Sylvain Lefebvre, 
Joe Murphy of San Jose, New Jersey's Dave Andreychuk and Craig 
Janney of the New York Islanders; and goalies Kirk McLean of 
Florida, Ken Wregget of Calgary and Washington's Rick Tabaracci.

<HEADLINE> Albright Pays Tribute, UNSCOM Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright showed up  
at a U.S. Mission farewell party for U.N. chief weapons inspector 
Richard Butler and said they had at least one thing in common: They 
are both on Saddam Hussein's hate list. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people are known by those who don't like them -- and  
to not be liked by Saddam Hussein is an honor,'' she said to 
laughter from the crowd of more than 100 Tuesday night at the 
official residence of the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been called a witch,'' said Albright, who was U.S.  
ambassador to the United Nations for four years before becoming 
secretary of state in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq banned Butler and the U.N. Special Commission which he  
heads from returning to the country after Butler ordered inspectors 
out of Baghdad just before U.S. and British airstrikes in 
mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler is an Australian whose contract as executive chairman of  
the commission, known as UNSCOM, expires today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that Ambassador Butler has done a remarkable job in a  
very difficult and challenging position,'' Albright said. ``I think 
the work that he did as the chairman of UNSCOM will be long 
remembered for the very perceptive and difficult job that it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Butler, who will become diplomat-in-residence at the Council on  
Foreign Relations in mid-July, never mentioned Iraq in his public 
comments -- saying only that he would always remember ``with the 
deepest gratitude the support that was given to me and the 
organization by the United States of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UNSCOM is charged under U.N. Security Council resolutions with  
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, a measure intended 
to punish and disarm Baghdad for invading Kuwait in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia and China have repeatedly called for UNSCOM to be  
abolished, and Security Council discussions on a new weapons 
inspection and monitoring organization are under way. 
</P>
<P>
	``The job is still to be done,'' Butler said, ``and I hope it  
will get under way soon.''

<HEADLINE> Brand, Francis, Davis Go 1,2,3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- All those trade scenarios, all those intricate  
plans that consumed Jerry Krause's life since he won the lottery a 
month ago turned out to be a bunch of Bull-oney. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the Chicago Bulls decided to keep their No. 1 pick  
and select Elton Brand, the college player of the year who left 
Duke after his sophomore season. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, a 6-foot-8 forward, was chosen after the Bulls took a  
serious last look at Rhode Island's Lamar Odom, bringing him into 
Chicago for a workout on the eve of the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Krause went with the safer of the two picks, choosing to try to  
rebuild his dynasty with a solid frontcourt player. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Francis was chosen second by Vancouver, Baron Davis went  
third to Charlotte, Odom went fourth to the Los Angeles Clippers 
and high schooler Jonathan Bender went fifth to Toronto but will be 
traded to Indiana for Antonio Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know where I was going to fit in this draft. I did  
want to be the No. 1 pick,'' Brand said. ``I feel I am the best 
player and I can improve a lot. I think I can be the cornerstone in 
their rebuilding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he knew he would be the No. 1 overall pick, Brand said:  
``Not at all. I didn't have the slightest idea. I feel blessed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, 20, was the first player ever to leave Duke as an  
underclassman. He averaged 16.2 points and 9.8 rebounds in his 
final season there, leading the Blue Devils into the NCAA 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand became the first player from Duke ever selected first  
overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just an outstanding person,'' Krause said. ``It was a  
very tough decision. We just came to a decision that we think Elton 
Brand is an outstanding player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies selected second and chose guard Francis, who had  
indicated he would be less than enthralled to play in Canada. 
Francis kept his head buried in his hands as his name was 
announced, then raised his arms in the air to a loud ovation as he 
walked onstage to meet commissioner David Stern. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis played in college at nearby Maryland, averaging 17.0  
points in his only season for the Terrapins. Francis, 22, was a 
first-team All-ACC selection last season and was widely considered 
one of the most exciting college players to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	A shooting guard in college who was expected to be a point guard  
in the pros, Francis might play alongside point guard Mike Bibby 
with the Grizzlies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, when I wake up tomorrow, I'll be happy,'' said  
Francis, who has never been to Canada. ``I feel relieved now more 
than happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was taken third by the Charlotte Hornets, who had said  
they would grab the UCLA guard if he was still available. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, 20, left the Bruins after a sophomore season in which he  
averaged 15.9 points and 5.1 assists while still recovering from a 
torn anterior cruciate ligament suffered during the 1998 NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis had said prior to the draft that he would prefer to play  
for the Los Angeles Clippers, who selected fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	The drafting of Davis is expected to speed up the Hornets'  
efforts to trade veteran point guard David Wesley. Charlotte also 
has been trying to deal one of its power forwards, Derrick Coleman 
or Anthony Mason. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of getting Davis, the Clippers landed Odom, the  
6-foot-10 phenom who so intrigued Krause. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old Odom had one of the most bizarre pre-draft  
existences of anyone, making himself eligible, hiring and then 
firing an agent, trying to get reinstated at Rhode Island and then 
missing a pre-draft physical before NBA scouts in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Those were only the latest travails involving Odom, who attended  
three high schools during his senior season and planned to enroll 
at UNLV before the validity of his entrance exam scores were 
brought into question. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some decisions I made may not have been the best at that  
time,'' Odom said. ``I'm 19 years old. I'm thankful I didn't make 
those mistakes when I'm 29 and it's too late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Rhode Island, he averaged 17.6 points, 9.4 rebounds and 3.7  
assists -- numbers that had many player personnel directors calling 
him the most talented all-around player available. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom's thoughts on joining the Clippers, the league's perennial  
doormat: ``When the Bulls got Michael Jordan, they weren't the best 
team in the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto, selecting fifth, took the rail-thin, 205-pound Bender  
of Picayune, Miss., who scored 31 points in the McDonald's 
All-American game, breaking Jordan's record by one. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raptors have already worked out a trade with Indiana that  
will send Bender to the Pacers in exchange for Davis. The trade 
will be formally announced Aug. 1, Davis' agent said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bender, 6-foot-10, was chosen higher than any high school  
entrant since Kevin Garnett, who went fifth overall to Minnesota in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Wally Szczerbiak went sixth to the Minnesota Timberwolves,  
becoming the first senior selected in this draft. In 1997 and 1998, 
seniors were the top picks overall. The Wolves acquired the sixth 
pick from New Jersey in the Stephon Marbury trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak, 22, a 6-7 small forward with NBA 3-point range and a  
strong all-around game, is one of three collegians who have been 
added to the U.S. national team that will compete in July for a 
qualifying berth in the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The others are Brand and Richard Hamilton, a shooting guard from  
Connecticut who was chosen seventh by the Washington Wizards -- much 
to the delight of the hometown crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, 21, left Connecticut after a junior season in which he  
averaged 21.5 points and led the Huskies to the national title. He 
could move right into the starting lineup if the Wizards lose Mitch 
Richmond to free agency. Richmond is said to be pondering a return 
to his original NBA team, the Golden State Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Cavaliers, who coveted Szczerbiak, had to settle  
for Utah point guard Andre Miller, a member of the first-team 
All-America team. The 23-year-old, who also completed four years of 
college, averaged 15.8 points and 5.6 assists for the Utes last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	He is Utah's career leader in steals and led the Utes to the  
NCAA championship game in a junior season in which he shot 55 
percent from the field -- a very high percentage for a point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Marion, a 6-7 forward from UNLV, went ninth overall to the  
Phoenix Suns, who acquired the pick from Dallas a year ago in the 
Steve Nash trade. Marion, who averaged 23.5 points for the Runnin' 
Rebels, left college after his junior year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Hawks selected Arizona point guard Jason Terry with  
the 10th pick, quickly filling the vacancy left by the trade of 
Mookie Blaylock to Golden State on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2 Terry averaged 21.9 points and 5.5 assists for the  
Wildcats, earning a first-team All-America selection. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland used its second first-round pick, 11th overall, to  
take Duke senior Trajan Langdon, a 6-foot-3 shooting guard 
originally from Anchorage, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	Langdon was the second member of the Blue Devils to be picked  
the first round, and Duke, which also lost William Avery and Corey 
Maggette, became the first school to have four first-rounders 
selected in the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raptors selected center Aleksandar Radojevic 12th overall,  
taking a chance on a 7-foot-3 giant from Montenegro who has been 
playing basketball for only a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggette went 13th to Seattle and Avery was picked 14th by  
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Knicks picked 7-foot-2 Frenchman Frederic Weis with  
the 15th pick, bypassing homegrown guard Ron Artest of St. John's, 
who went 16th to the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta chose Cal Bowdler of Old Dominion 17th, Denver took  
James Posey of Xavier with the 18th pick, Quincy Lewis of Minnesota 
went 19th to Utah, Dion Glover of Georgia Tech went 20th to Atlanta 
and Jeff Foster of Southwest Texas State went 21st to Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny Thomas of New Mexico went 22nd to Houston, Devean George  
of Division III Augsburg (Minn.) went 23rd to the Los Angeles 
Lakers, Andrei Kirilenko of CSKA Russia was picked 24th by Utah, 
and the Miami Heat selected homegrown forward Tim James of Miami 
with pick No. 25.

<HEADLINE>  Hubbell Pleads Guilty in Starr Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prosecutor Kenneth Starr today wrapped up the  
Arkansas phase of his five-year investigation with two fresh guilty 
pleas from longtime presidential friend Webster Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
	``After five years, it's over. Our lives can begin again,''  
Hubbell said outside the courthouse after being sentenced to one 
year of probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell pleaded guilty to concealing information from regulators  
about his firm's work for the savings and loan at the center of the 
Whitewater investigation and said he had been interviewed anew by 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the office of independent counsel, as I told them five  
years ago, that I have no knowledge of any wrongdoing on behalf of 
the president or Mrs. Clinton,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, prosecutors asked for no jail time,  
restitution or fine for the felony or a second guilty plea by 
Hubbell on a misdemeanor charge of failure to pay taxes. Hubbell 
previously served a 16-month prison sentence for bilking his law 
firm and his clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Both inside and outside court, Starr gave indications he is  
trying to wrap up the rest of his probe quickly. The prosecutor 
said the Arkansas phase of the investigation ``has been concluded 
by today's activities'' and that he is trying to bring other 
aspects of the probe to ``an orderly conclusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said certain matters remain under investigation by a  
federal grand jury. He was not more specific. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell pleaded guilty to a broad concealment charge alleging he  
hid from investigators his and Hillary Rodham Clinton's legal work 
for the failed Madison Guaranty Savings &AMP; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the court, the former associate attorney general  
declared he had only admitted to one facet of that charge -- that he 
had failed to disclose to federal regulators a potential conflict 
of interest before doing work for the government concerning 
Madison. 
</P>
<P>
	But Starr said his office would have been able to prove all the  
allegations underlying the concealment charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor told the judge, however, that he arranged the  
plea deal in part because the contoversy over his investigation had 
``found its way into the hearts and minds of prospective jurors'' 
and could have affected the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, press secretary Joe Lockhart said, ``The president  
and first lady recognize that these past few years have been very 
difficult ones for Webb and Suzy Hubbell, and they hope that this 
resolution will allow the Hubbells to move on to a brighter 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell's plea before U.S. District Judge James Robertson halted  
plans for a trial next month that could have been embarrassing for 
Mrs. Clinton as she explores whether to run for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	And it ended two separate criminal cases brought last year  
against Hubbell, who already has served 16 months in prison for an 
earlier guilty plea in Starr's probe. 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, Hubbell was accused of covering up his and Mrs.  
Clinton's legal work on a 1,050-acre land development south of 
Little Rock owned by Mrs. Clinton's Whitewater partner, Jim 
McDougal, and Hubbell's father-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	The land deal -- which federal regulators said was riddled with  
sham transactions -- cost the failing savings and loan owned by the 
Clintons' Whitewater partner $3.8 million and contributed to the 
insolvency of the institution. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax indictment, Hubbell was accused of failing to declare  
as income $74,000 of more than $450,000 in fees from 15 employers 
in 1994, when top Clinton advisers arranged consulting contracts 
for the former associate attorney general from Vernon Jordan and 
other close friends of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, he pleaded guilty to another charge of failing to pay  
taxes that superseded that indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell had promised to fully cooperate with Starr's  
investigation when he pleaded guilty in 1994 to stealing $400,000 
from his Arkansas law firm and its clients. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hubbell's memory lapses about key events in the Whitewater  
saga slowed the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Two events renewed Starr's interest in Hubbell in 1996.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's law-firm billing records emerged under  
still-unexplained circumstances inside the White House, revealing 
her work and Hubbell's on the fraudulent land development south of 
Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	And Starr discovered the financial assistance to Hubbell  
arranged by the president's friends, which raised the specter of 
``hush money.''

	Daniel Topham and his wife, Cynthia, contended Dr. Gail Shapiro,  
an allergist, negligently treated Topham for a sting allergy in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Topham, 30, was stung by yellow jackets twice within a week in  
1992, and the second sting triggered a near-fatal allergic reaction 
that prompted his doctor to prescribe him a self-injection device 
containing epinephrine, a sting-allergy-fighting medication. 
</P>
<P>
	But four years later, Shapiro gave Topham a skin test considered  
the most reliable way to determine whether a patient has a venom 
allergy. The skin test came back negative. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro testified she opted not to use venom immunotherapy to  
desensitize Topham to future stings. 
</P>
<P>
	Stung in July 1997 -- Topham went into cardiac arrest, spent two  
weeks in a coma and suffered severe brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tophams' lawyers argued that Shapiro was negligent because  
she should have tried to confirm the test results via a blood test. 
The jurors agreed.

<HEADLINE> Frontier Agrees To Meet With Qwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Frontier Corp., a small local and long-distance  
phone company, said today it has agreed to meet with executives 
from Qwest to explore the company's $11.8 billion takeover offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement opens the door to formal negotiations with Qwest  
could jeopardize Frontier's existing $10.9 billion merger agreement 
with Global Crossing Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest Communications International Inc. and Global Crossing are  
fighting for control of Frontier and U S West Inc., a regional Baby 
Bell phone company. Both suitors want the customer bases and sales 
of Frontier and U S West to help build global fiber-optic cable 
networks capable of carrying high-speed Internet traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier, which is based in Rochester, N.Y., released a  
statement saying that its decision to hold talks with Qwest ``in no 
way reflects a change in the Frontier Board's current approval and 
recommendation of the Global Crossing merger agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest, however, took today's announcement as a turning of the  
tide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are extremely pleased Frontier has decided to act in the  
best interests of its shareowners, employees and customers,'' said 
Tyler Gronbach, a spokesman for Denver-based Qwest. ``We expect to 
begin discussions immediately with Frontier in the hopes of 
striking a definitive merger agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Global Crossing, based in Bermuda, said the  
company would issue a statement later this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier's shares rose 87 1/2 cents to $59 in early morning trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange. U S West's shares were off 12 1/2 
cents at $57.93 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest's stock fell $1.43 3/4 to $32.87 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market,  
and Global Crossing's shares were off $2.06 1/4 to $42.50, also on the 
Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	If Frontier breaks its agreement with Global Crossing, it could  
also scuttle Global Crossing's $32 billion deal to acquire U S 
West. 
</P>
<P>
	``We also hope that U S West will follow suit, given our  
superior offer that is currently on the table and engages with 
Qwest management as soon as possible,'' Gronbach said. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West has not yet responded to Qwest's offer, which was  
sweetened last week to $34.7 billion. A spokesman for U S West, 
which is based in Denver, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The communications industry is being reshaped by the Internet  
and its vast potential for transmission of information, electronic 
commerce and new forms of entertainment. Companies are trying to 
secure the technology and customers to compete in a new market.

<HEADLINE>  Jones, Johnson Win at Bislett Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Three women set world seasonal bests at the  
Bislett Games on Wednesday, but track and field's biggest female 
star was not among them. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion Jones began her quest for the $1 million Golden League  
jackpot winning the 200 meters in a time of 22.13 seconds. The 
American led all the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was rather chilly, but the conditions were the same for  
everybody,'' Jones said. ``We just came to Europe after our trials, 
so I'm satisfied with my win and time. The race for the jackpot 
started well. It was my first 200 on this track and it was OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden League comprises the most important one-day meetings  
in Oslo, Rome, Monaco, Zurich, Brussels, Berlin and Paris. A $1 
million jackpot will be shared among those athletes who win Golden 
League events in all seven meets. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones won both her previous 100-meter races at Bislett, one of  
the sport's most storied venues where 51 world records have been 
broken since 1924. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 200 is her favorite distance. She had a winning time of  
22.10 in the USA Championships last week, .29 off her seasonal 
best. Last year, she ran a 21.62, the second fastest time in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Beverly McDonald of Jamaica was runnerup Wednesday in 22.51 and  
third went to Zhanna Pintusevich-Block of Ukraine in 22.66. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's seasonal bests were set by Gabriela Szabo of Romania  
in the 3,000 meters, Tanja Damaske of Germany in the javelin and 
Deon Hemmings of Jamaica in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
	Szabo, one of the world's top middle and long-distance runners,  
was perhaps the most impressive as she won her race in 8:27.21. It 
was 11 seconds faster than her previous best this year and also a 
new Bislett Stadium record. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good, but not the best,'' Szabo said. ``I'm only at the  
beginning of the year. But I've had a very good training for this 
season, so my expectations are high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zahra Ouaziz of Morocco was second in 8:28.26 and Gete Wami of  
Ethiopia third in 8:29.83. 
</P>
<P>
	Damaske's best throw of 214 feet, 9 1/2 inches was also a new  
German record. Still, she wasn't very pleased with her series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any of my throws were ideal. I hope they will  
come in Spain in August,'' said Damaske, refering to the World 
Championships in Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	The women were competing with the new javelin.  
</P>
<P>
	``Today we had a wind which would have been better for the old  
javelin,'' Damaske said. ``The old jav could sail better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hemmings took the 400 in 53.48.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very good race for me,'' she said. ``I'm not even  
tired. To beat the world's best time (this year) here was beyond my 
expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Barmasai of Kenya clocked 8:06.15 in the 3,000  
steeplechase and Kenyan-born Wilson Kipketer won the 800 in 1:43.11 
for seasonal bests among the men. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not bad, but I have more in me,'' Barmasai said. ``The first  
pacemaker was good, the second was a problem. He didn't do 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kipketer, who set the 800 world record two years ago during a  
season when he also won his second world championship gold medal, 
is trying to come back after a bout with malaria that hurt him 
badly in last year's European Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``The king is back, but only almost,'' Kipketer said. ``It's  
still not perfect. I need to adjust some small things. I still 
can't train at 100 percent after my illness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	World champion Allen Johnson won the men's 110 meter hurdles in  
13.14, missing another world seasonal best by just .03. Fellow 
American Larry Wade, fastest this season, didn't compete. Johnson's 
time equaled the Bislett Stadium record he set two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time is OK,'' Johson said. ``This win shows to people who  
wrote me off that, after my injury problems, I'm back. I'm not 
dead. My strongest part was the finish and that's good. I'm happy 
that I equaled my stadium record. That's something special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florian Schwarthoff of Germany finished second in 13.22 and Mark  
Crear of the United States third in 13.31 in a race marred by two 
false starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia, the world's top long-distance  
runner, failed in an attempt to break the 5,000 record he set last 
year in Helsinki, Finland. He won the race, which did not count 
toward the Golden League, in 12:53.92. 
</P>
<P>
	It was more than 14 seconds off his world record, but the first  
sub-13 at Bislett. Said Aoutia of Morocco set the old Bislett mark 
of 13:00.40 in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was rather cool and windy, so we changed our plan,''  
Gebrselassie said. ``The pacemakers were OK. We didn't run fast 
enough for two or three laps. But it's something special to run a 
sub-13 as first ever on this track.''

<HEADLINE> Hubbell Pleads Guilty in Starr Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Longtime presidential friend Webster Hubbell  
pleaded guilty today to concealing his and first lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton's legal work on a fraudulent land deal back in 
Arkansas. Prosecutors recommended no jail time or fine for the 
felony. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a deal with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr,  
prosecutors asked that Hubbell serve one year of probation. U.S. 
District Judge James Robertson will decide the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell also pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in a tax evasion  
case that revolved around payments he received from friends of the 
president in 1994 and 1995, while he was under investigation by 
Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked in court whether he would change his previous ``innocent''  
plea on failure to disclose facts to Whitewater investigators, a 
somber-looking Hubbell answered, ``I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former associate attorney general answered the tax charge  
with one word -- ``Guilty'' -- as his wife, Suzy, watched from the 
front row. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr sat at the prosecution table during the hearing that ended  
his nearly five years of investigation of Hubbell, who was formerly 
the No. 3 official at the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea halted plans for a trial next month that could have  
been embarrassing for Mrs. Clinton as she explores whether to run 
for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	And it finished two separate criminal cases brought last year  
against Hubbell, who already has served 16 months in prison for an 
earlier guilty plea in Starr's probe. 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, Hubbell was accused of covering up his and Mrs.  
Clinton's legal work on a 1,050-acre land development south of 
Little Rock owned by Mrs. Clinton's Whitewater partner, Jim 
McDougal, and Hubbell's father-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	The land deal -- which federal regulators said was riddled with  
sham transactions -- cost the failing savings and loan owned by the 
Clintons' Whitewater partner $3.8 million and contributed to the 
insolvency of the institution. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax indictment, Hubbell was accused of failing to declare  
as income $74,000 of more than $450,000 in fees from 15 employers 
in 1994, when top Clinton advisers arranged consulting contracts 
for the former associate attorney general from Vernon Jordan and 
other close friends of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment said Hubbell paid only $30,000 in taxes for  
1989-92 and 1994-95, even though he earned more than $1 million 
from 1994 to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment said that by the end of 1997, Hubbell and his  
wife had liquidated about $1 million in assets and spent virtually 
all their money. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell had promised to fully cooperate with Starr's  
investigation when he 
</P>
<P>
	pleaded guilty in 1994 to stealing $400,000 from his Arkansas  
law firm and its clients. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hubbell's memory lapses about key events in the Whitewater  
saga slowed the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Two events renewed Starr's interest in Hubbell in 1996.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's law-firm billing records emerged under  
still-unexplained circumstances inside the White House, revealing 
her work and Hubbell's on the fraudulent land development south of 
Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	And Starr discovered the financial assistance to Hubbell  
arranged by the president's friends, which raised the specter of 
``hush money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question now is whether Hubbell has anything further to tell  
Starr's investigators about the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	While Hubbell will be subjected to questioning once again by  
Starr's office, the prosecutor may end up with little more from 
Hubbell than he had in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see anything Starr gets out of it except the windup of  
these proceedings and another notch in his belt,'' said George 
Washington University law professor Mary Cheh. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently released court records reveal that in his first round  
of cooperation with Starr's office in 1995, Hubbell gave the 
prosecutor damaging information about major figures in the 
Whitewater scandal, while providing little if anything useful to 
the prosecutor about his longtime friends.

<HEADLINE> Pak Back at Site of Record Rounds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYLVANIA, Ohio (AP) -- This will provide little comfort for her  
rivals: Se Ri Pak insists she is better than she was a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Pak needed a sponsor's exemption to play in the  
Jamie Farr Kroger Classic. Last year, she rewrote the LPGA record 
book in the same tournament. She set tour marks for 18- and 72-hole 
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend, the 21-year-old South Korean defends her title at  
Highland Meadows Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won four times last year but I was just a rookie,'' Pak  
said. ``I didn't know anything. I feel now like I can trust my game 
and play comfortably. I have so much more confidence in my game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also has more of a comfort zone in her personal life. During  
the offseason, she fired her manager and coach. She still relies 
heavily on her father, Joon Chul Pak, to guide her career, but she 
is having more say in her day-to-day activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before, there were too many people trying to take care of me.  
It was crazy,'' she said Tuesday. ``Right now, I change my mind and 
my goal. Now it is 50 percent for me and 50 percent for my game. 
I'm happy. If I play bad or good, I'm happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pak, a former track star in South Korea before winning 30  
amateur titles, stunned golf by winning the 1998 McDonald's LPGA 
Championship as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	She was no one-tournament wonder, answering with three victories  
in 24 days. Wherever she went, she drew huge crowds and a large 
Asian media contingent. 
</P>
<P>
	And with it came incessant pressure. Pak said she got some  
advice from such players as Nancy Lopez and Lori Kane. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told me that it was OK to say 'no' to things. I listened.  
I tried,'' said Pak, hospitalized with a virus infection brought on 
by exhaustion last fall after returning to South Korea. ``At the 
end of the season, I understood what they meant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She captured her second major at the U.S. Women's Open, edging  
amateur Jenny Chuasiriporn in a 20-hole playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days later, tired and unfocused, she played in the opening  
round at the Farr. She said she felt she owed it to the tournament 
to be there, since she had been given a sponsor's exemption as a 
19-year-old unknown one year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	She shot an even-par 71 in the opening round, then got 9 1/2 hours  
sleep and torched the course in the second round. She had five 
birdies on each side, finishing with a 61 that was one shot better 
than the lowest LPGA score ever. 
</P>
<P>
	With each hole, the gallery shadowing her grew bigger and  
louder. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I start on the first hole, not many gallery follow me,''  
she said after the round. ``Maybe after nine, there was a little 
more. Then a little more. Then later, it was almost like a Sunday. 
There were so many people. They make a big loud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She's on another hot streak now, winning two weeks ago at the  
ShopRite Classic before tying for seventh last week while defending 
her LPGA Championship title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like every week I can win,'' Pak said. ``The last few  
weeks, it's been working. I don't need to push myself too much. I 
don't have any pressure like I did last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pak is seventh on the money list with more than $325,000 heading  
into the Farr tournament, which has a $135,000 first-place check. 
</P>
<P>
	Six players who have won LPGA tournaments this season --  
including No. 2 money-winner Karrie Webb and No. 3 Meg Mallon -- 
join six former Farr champions in the 144-player field.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down Despite Market Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar slipped against other currencies  
Wednesday despite a rally in stocks and bonds following the Fed's 
decision to make a small increase in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro edged up against the dollar to $1.0338 in late New York  
trading compared to $1.0320 late Tuesday. The dollar slipped to 
120.93 Japanese yen, down from 121.06 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has been mired in summer doldrums this week despite  
several strong showings on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, the Fed announced that it was nudging short-term  
interest rates up by a quarter point. But traders had already 
anticipated an increase of that size, so the announcement did not 
have a major impact on currency trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks and bonds rose, however, after the Fed surprised markets  
by announcing that it was abandoning its bias toward raising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	News that the Fed was adopting a neutral stance toward interest  
rates in the future -- meaning that it was no longer leaning toward 
raising them -- took away some of the dollar's appeal versus other 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates mean higher returns on liquid investments  
held in that currency, so the prospect that U.S. rates may not 
increase for a while made the dollar less attractive as a place for 
global investors to park their money. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5479 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5507, and 1.4667 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4779. The British 
pound rose to $1.5785 from $1.5751. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8914 German 
marks, down from 1.8950; 6.3452 French francs, down from 6.3573; 
and 1,872.66 Italian lire, down from 1,876.17.

<HEADLINE> Flooding Kills 77 in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- A week of heavy rains destroyed houses, inundated  
crops and killed two more people in central China, raising the 
death toll from this summer's floods to at least 77, state media 
reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 12 inches of rain rushed through narrow valleys near the  
city of Xianyang in central Hubei province, causing hundreds of 
homes to collapse, the Beijing Evening News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people died and more than 42,000 acres of farmland was  
flooded, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubei was one of the hardest hit areas in the catastrophic  
flooding that killed 4,150 people in China last year. Much of the 
damage was along the Yangtze River. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, flooding has killed 49 people over the past two  
months in Sichuan province, the Xinhua News Agency said. It quoted 
Vice Governor Jing Zhengshu as saying losses to crops, factories, 
homes and other property was an estimated $24 million. 
</P>
<P>
	With rain still falling along Yangtze tributaries in Sichuan,  
Xinhua warned that the main river, China's longest, may start to 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Further downstream in Jiangxi province, floods swamped the city  
of Jingdezhen, the traditional center of the porcelain industry. 
Provincial leaders rushed to the city to oversee flood fighting, 
Xinhua said. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials there began mobilizing residents to reinforce  
dikes, Xinhua said.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Lawmakers Defeat Gambling Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Lawmakers in the state with the largest  
number of video gambling machines have failed -- for the sixth time 
-- to agree on a plan to regulate the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Gov. Jim Hodges was elected last year with financial  
help from the $2.5-billion-a-year industry. 
</P>
<P>
	He favored a bill that would let voters decide at a Nov. 2  
referendum if they want to ban the games. If they don't, the state 
would claim more taxes from the industry and new regulations would 
be adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	But the state House voted 75-37 during a special session  
Tuesday, falling several votes short of the necessary two-thirds 
majority of 82 votes for the bill to be considered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took 12 years to get into this mess and I think it might  
take more than one day to get out,'' Hodges said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodges had led efforts to ban the industry when he served as  
House minority leader. Some Republicans called his referendum 
approach a sellout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a joke and it shows Governor Hodges for what he is -- a  
tool and a pawn of the video poker industry,'' said Republican Rep. 
James Klauber. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina has about 34,000 video gambling machines, nearly  
double that of Nevada, which has 17,922 machines outside of 
casinos.

<HEADLINE> Mitsubishi To End U.S. 3000GT Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Mitsubishi Motors Corp. will stop exporting its  
flashy 3000GT sports car to the United States at the end of this 
model year because of slow sales, the Japanese automaker said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to ax the pricey 3000GT follows similar moves by  
other Japanese automakers in recent years, as demand for 
high-performance, ``grand touring'' sports cars has declined in 
favor of smaller, less costly roadsters. The Nissan 300ZX, Mazda 
RX-7 and Toyota Supra met the same fate earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Honda Motor Co.'s Acura NSX, ``we're the last ones  
standing in that segment,'' said Kim Custer, a spokesman for 
Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America Inc. ``People aren't buying those 
expensive Japanese sports cars anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi sold only 4,100 of the cars in the United States last  
year, down from a high of 15,230 in 1994. Sales totaled 1,476 this 
year through May. Mitsubishi will continue to sell the car in Japan 
and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Chrysler Corp. stopped importing its version of the  
3000GT, which it called the Dodge Stealth, in late 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi expects its redesigned, American-made Eclipse sports  
car with an optional 3-liter V6 engine to take up some of the slack 
form the 3000GT's departure in the 2000 model year, Custer said. 
Eighty percent of 3000GT sales were with the normally aspirated V6, 
as opposed to the more expensive twin-turbo, all-wheel-drive VR-4 
version. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3000GT was introduced in the United States in late 1991 as a  
'92 model. In 1991 it was named Motor Trend magazine's import car 
of the year.

<HEADLINE> Rafter Leads Aussie Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Patrick Rafter felt no guilt about  
ending Boris Becker's comeback at Wimbledon on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really care, actually,'' Rafter said after beating  
Becker 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 to reach his first Wimbledon quarterfinal. 
``I'm here at the quarters and I've got to think about that. That 
might be selfish, but that's the way it goes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It probably would have been better for (Becker) to finish in a  
bit more style. He does have a presence out there, but his game 
wasn't really firing today and I felt I couldn't hit the ball much 
better. It wasn't a good combination for him to leave on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter went out to play doubles, teaming with Sweden's Jonas  
Bjorkman to reach the quarters, after beating Becker. But the 
Australian said he would not play Grand Slam doubles after this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker had earlier expressed his surprise that Rafter would  
jeopodize his title chances by playing doubles, and Rafter agreed 
that the strain is too much when bad weather means having to play 
two matches a day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfortunate because it's a good way to hit out when you  
have your day off,'' he said. ``But the frustrating thing about it 
now is that I've got singles and doubles again tomorrow and it 
won't give me much time to get ready. So this is the last year I'll 
be doing this sort of thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other Australians are also into the quarterfinals. One was  
expected. The other was virtually an unknown two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Philippoussis beat Greg Rusedski in four sets to make it to  
the last eight for the second time and set up a clash with 
defending champion Pete Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be relaxed out there (against Sampras),'' said  
Philippoussis. ``Obviously people expect him to win, but I've got a 
lot of self-belief at the moment and I've realized there is no 
reason I can't go all the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jelena Dokic, a 16-year-old qualifier, beat top-seeded Martina  
Hingis in the first round and kept on winning, and now is bidding 
to become the first woman qualifier ever to reach the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Dokic takes on another qualifier, 18-year-old Californian  
Alexandra Stevenson, for a place in the semis. Never have two 
qualifiers made it into the quarterfinals in the same year, and 
never has one advanced into the final four.

<HEADLINE> Compromise on Y2K Bill Jeopardized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A deal struck Tuesday on a bill limiting Y2K  
lawsuits was in danger of falling through today, with the White 
House seeking additional changes before agreeing to accept it, 
congressional sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle said the bill, which  
lawmakers had hoped to move through Congress and send to the 
president by Thursday, was ``still somewhat of a work in 
progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently there were glitches last night that still require  
additional attention,'' he said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	White House Chief of Staff John Podesta on Tuesday sent Congress  
a letter saying that, with changes made during days of 
negotiations, he was ready to urge President Clinton to sign the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	However, sources said, the White House was still dissatisfied  
with several parts of the bill, including provisions on how 
shareholder suits are covered under the Y2K legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Other sources characterized the differences as ``loose ends''  
and said they didn't represent fundamental problems. Staff from the 
House Rules Committee said they would take up the compromise bill 
as planned today, setting the stage for a full House vote on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	With the announcement Tuesday that a deal had been reached,  
business and high-tech groups were delighted, saying the 
legislation could save them billions of dollars better used to fix 
computers. Consumer groups, though, accused the White House of 
sacrificing consumers in favor of business special interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the White House had made clear that Clinton would veto  
the bills coming out of the House and Senate because they went too 
far in taking away the rights of consumers to take legal action 
when they are wronged. 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 problem -- also called Y2K and the millennium bug --  
occurs because some computer programs, especially older ones, might 
fail when the date changes to 2000. Because the programs were 
written to recognize only the last two digits of a year, such 
programs could read the digits ``00'' as 1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise over the bill made several changes somewhat  
favorable to consumers, including making it more difficult to move 
a class action suit to federal courts, where a case can be tied up 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
	A controversial measure ensuring that a business will be liable  
only for the proportion of damages it causes was also modified to 
say that ``bad actors'' won't be eligible for this legal status. 
Proportionate liability is supported by business groups who say 
lawyers often target companies with the deepest pockets, regardless 
of their involvement in a case. 
</P>
<P>
	The main tenets of the bill were provisions giving companies 90  
days to fix computers before lawsuits can be filed and encouraging 
mediation. It also puts some limits on class action suits and caps 
punitive damages for small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last night at midnight this bill was on life support,'' said  
Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chief Senate co-sponsor with Sen. John 
McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyden and Dodd were the Democratic point men, working until 2  
a.m. to get the White House and Republicans to agree on their 
compromise proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd said he talked to Clinton in Connecticut Monday and was on  
the phone with him at 1:30 a.m. Tuesday. Clinton wanted a bill but 
was particularly strong about the class action issue and ensuring 
that consumers will get full redress from those ``bad actors'' who 
purposely cause harm, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyden said Vice President Al Gore, who has had close ties with  
the high tech industry and needs their support in his presidential 
run, also was personally involved for the past several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not pretending politics is unimportant here,'' Wyden  
said, but he said Gore was also very much involved in the substance 
of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology  
Association of America, which actively supported the bill, said 
``both sides were miscalculating'' up to several weeks ago, with 
Republicans hoping to win high tech support by forcing Clinton to 
veto the bill and the White House thinking it could veto the bill 
and then work with the industry to write a new one. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sent a very strong message to both sides that this was not  
politics as usual,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both Republicans and Democrats have put politics behind them  
to work together on a solution to a potential global technology 
crisis,'' said National Association of Manufacturers president 
Jerry Jasinowski. 
</P>
<P>
	But Joan Claybrook of the consumer group Public Citizen accused  
the White House of a ``shocking about-face'' on the Y2K issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``These corporations have contributed millions in campaign  
contributions to both political parties and have just purchased a 
strong legal shield for themselves for making and selling 
Y2K-defective products,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Energy East Buys Conn. Gas Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Energy East Corp. continued its Northeast  
shopping spree today with an $355 million agreement to purchase a 
second Connecticut-based natural gas provider. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement would make CTG Resources Inc. a wholly owned  
subsidiary of Energy East. CTG Resources is the parent company of 
Connecticut Natural Gas Corp., which distributes natural gas to 
about 142,000 customers, primarily in the Hartford and Greenwich 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month Energy East, the parent company of New York  
State Electric &AMP; Gas, also struck a deal to buy Central Maine Power 
for $957 million. It has another deal pending to acquire Southern 
Connecticut Gas Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``This transaction is about growth and competition,'' said Wes  
von Schack, chairman of Energy East. ``This transaction is another 
important step in our strategy to use our strong balance sheet and 
the proceeds from the sale of our generation assets to selectively 
grow our distribution in business in the Northeast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the three mergers are approved by state and federal  
regulators, Energy East will be one of the largest energy providers 
in the Northeast with 1.3 million electric customers and more than 
500,000 natural gas customers in New York, Connecticut and Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement announced today, 45 percent of CTG  
Resources' common stock will be converted into Energy East common 
stock with a value of $41 per share. The rest will be paid in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur C. Marquardt will remain as CTG Resources' chairman,  
president and chief executive.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Jump on Fed Action / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks surged in Thursday morning, riding  
a rally on Wall Street sparked by the Federal Reserve's indication 
that its tiny hike in interest rates may be all that's needed to 
keep inflation at bay. The dollar edged higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose a sharp 359.54  
points, or 2.05 percent, to 17,889.28 at the close of the morning 
session. On Wednesday, the average closed down 252.05 points, or 
1.42 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.88 yen, up 0.02 yen from late Wednesday in  
Tokyo but slightly below its late New York level of 120.93 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo stock market started higher in a follow-through move  
from New York where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 155.45 
points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 10,970.80 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section rose 26.59 points, or 1.88 percent, to 
1,442.79 at the end of the morning session. The TOPIX closed down 
9.04 points, or 0.63 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, the Fed raised short-term U.S. interest rates by a  
quarter point -- an anticipated move that did not have a major 
impact on currency trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials applauded the hike.  
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the ... decision to hike rates was appropriate. It  
was made in line with the status of the U.S. economy,'' said 
Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the international bureau at Japan's 
Finance Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed did surprise markets, however, by announcing it was  
abandoning its bias toward raising rates further. 
</P>
<P>
	News that the Fed was adopting a neutral stance toward interest  
rates -- meaning it was no longer leaning toward raising them -- sent 
some investors away from the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates mean higher returns on liquid investments  
held in that currency, so the prospect that U.S. rates may not 
increase for a while made the dollar less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the greenback moved lower from its New  
York level after U.S. funds sold dollars to invest in Japanese 
stocks, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said market attention has now shifted to the Bank of  
Japan's ``tankan'' survey of corporate sentiment due out Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 125.57 yen, up from  
125.06 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.8350  
percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.8500 percent, driving its 
price up to 99.70 yen from 99.57 yen.

	Fed Raises Interest Rates, Dow Up  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve raised interest rates  
today for the first time in two years, hoping to slow the red-hot 
U.S. economy by making it more expensive for American consumers and 
businesses to borrow. The Fed announced it was increasing its 
target for the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge 
each other on overnight loans, by a quarter-point to 5 percent. 
Just before the 2:15 p.m. EDT announcement, the Dow Jones 
industrial average was down about 50. Just after the announcement, 
it was up more than 150. Just before 3 p.m. EDT, the Dow was up 
109.23 to 10,924.58. Advancing issues on the New York Stock 
Exchange led decliners 1,760-1,170. The Nasdaq Composite Index was 
up 31.41 at 2,673.52.

	Okla. Bombing Sentence Overturned  
</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A federal appeals court today threw out Michael  
Fortier's 12-year sentence for his role in the Oklahoma City 
bombing, ruling that guidelines used to determine the prison term 
were too harsh. His lawyer said the ruling could mean freedom for 
Fortier. A three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals ordered a new sentencing hearing for Fortier, who pleaded 
guilty to failing to alert authorities to the bomb plot, helping 
Timothy McVeigh sell stolen weapons and lying to the FBI.

	House Passes Teen Abortion Bill

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved new abortion restrictions  
today by voting to make it more difficult for a minor to end a 
pregnancy. Under a bill adopted 270-159, anyone who avoids parental 
involvement laws by taking a pregnant girl out of state for an 
abortion could be prosecuted in federal court. But the vote was 
more than a dozen short of the required two-thirds majority, or 286 
votes, needed to overturn a threatened White House veto.

	Clinton: Medicare Plan Is Affordable

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Saying the nation is too prosperous to relegate  
older Americans to a life of sickliness and worry, President 
Clinton today appealed for passage of his Medicare drug plan. The 
president traveled to Chicago for the first of several national 
visits by top administration officials to sell the Medicare 
proposal directly to senior citizens. On Tuesday, Clinton proposed 
several changes in Medicare including having the government help 
the disabled and people 65 and older pay for prescription drugs 
under Medicare -- up to $1,000 a year initially in return for a $24 
monthly patient charge.

pleas from longtime presidential friend Webster Hubbell. ``After 
five years, it's over. Our lives can begin again,'' Hubbell said 
outside the courthouse after being sentenced to one year of 
probation. Hubbell pleaded guilty to concealing information from 
regulators about his firm's work for the savings and loan at the 
center of the Whitewater investigation and said he had been 
interviewed anew by prosecutors.

	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- After public protests, six Cubans who  
jumped out of a boat just off shore, then fought to evade Coast 
Guardsmen trying to keep them from reaching land, will be allowed 
to stay in this country to apply for asylum. Under U.S. policy, 
Cubans who reach shore are allowed to stay and eventually get work 
permits, but those found at sea -- even a few yards offshore -- are 
usually returned to Cuba.

tournament again after losing today to No. 2 Patrick Rafter. 
Becker, a three-time Wimbledon champion, two years ago said he 
would never again play at the All-England Club, but changed his 
mind and decided this year to take one more chance. Also today, 
five-time Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras powered into the 
quarterfinals with a straight-sets victory against Daniel Nestor. 
And seven-time women's champion Steffi Graf completed an easy 
victory over 16-year-old Belgian qualifier Kim Clijsters. Graf will 
next face Venus Williams, who rallied to beat Anna Kournikova 3-6, 
6-3, 6-2.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lamar Odom, Elton Brand and Steve Francis are  
among the prizes in tonight's NBA draft. Wally Szczerbiak of Miami 
of Ohio and UCLA guard Baron Davis are expected to round out the 
top five. Most of the intrigue surrounding the top choice was 
swirling around Chicago Bulls general manager Jerry Krause, who 
owns the No. 1 selection and has been actively shopping it around 
the league. Vancouver also has been shopping the No. 2 pick.

<HEADLINE> Ravens' Blackshear Gets New Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Ravens agreed to a five-year,  
$18.7 million contract extension with right guard Jeff Blackshear, 
including a signing bonus estimated at $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Moriarty, Ravens vice president of administration, and  
Blackshear's agent, Ted Marchibroda Jr., agreed to terms late 
Tuesday after months of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackshear, 30, is a seven-year veteran who had one year left on  
his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a team leader and an important part of our offense,''  
team owner Art Modell told The (Baltimore) Sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackshear was considered one of the team's top free-agent  
prospects, along with defensive end Michael McCrary, who is still 
negotiating. Blackshear bolsters the offense at a time when the 
team is courting running back Lawrence Phillips.

<HEADLINE> Retiring AID Head Vents Frustration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- J. Brian Atwood has a disquieting message as  
he prepares to step down as head of the U.S. foreign aid agency: 
Don't believe those stories about democracy and free enterprise 
enabling developing countries to lift themselves out of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	And part of the problem, according to Atwood, is what he sees as  
Washington's pinch-penny attitude toward Third World problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``What will it take to wake up our political leaders?'' he  
asked. ``More failed states? More wars? More south-to-north 
migration? More transmission of infectious diseases? More 
terrorism?'' 
</P>
<P>
	After six years as head of the Agency for International  
Development, Atwood will return to the private sector next week. He 
could have gone quietly, as his predecessors have done, but decided 
not to. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave his valedictory Tuesday at a luncheon at the Overseas  
Development Council, which attempts to sensitize opinion-makers on 
Third World issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sad and even dangerous reality is that globalization and  
the democratic market economy movement have not closed the gap 
between rich and poor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Much of the change we are seeing is occurring within the  
previous ruling classes of these societies. Some in the donor 
community seem content to nurture reform without equity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Economic growth, he said, can reduce poverty only with  
investments in health care, education, job creation, community 
development and food security. 
</P>
<P>
	The industrial world is getting ``shamelessly rich'' while most  
of the world's people are losing ground, Atwood said. He put the 
ratio of rich to poor at about 65 to 1, or for every $65 earned in 
industrial countries, $1 is earned in poor ones. About 1.3 billion 
people live in extreme poverty, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood called the government's international affairs budget ``a  
joke. There is no money to do anything,'' he said. ``It's 
outrageous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He took aim at the congressional class of 1994, the election  
that gave Republicans control of the House and Senate. It was 
filled with ``nonpassport-carrying members,'' Atwood said, a 
not-so-subtle suggestion that such people think provincially, not 
globally. 
</P>
<P>
	Another source of distress for Atwood was U.S. policy toward the  
United Nations. ``What we are doing to the United Nations system is 
unconscionable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a time when the U.N. is bending under the weight of human  
crises, most emanating from the developing world, we are sapping it 
of its vitality by refusing to pay our bills. Then we criticize it 
for not doing its job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He described as ``shameful'' a recent compromise under which the  
Clinton administration would pay $819 million in arrears on the 
condition that it pay a smaller share in the future. The 
congressionally drafted approach is ``designed to appease people 
whose real goal is to kill the United Nations,'' Atwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood was scheduled to become ambassador to Brazil after his  
service at AID, but Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee chairman, refused to convene hearings on the 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms was smarting from Atwood's characterization of him as an  
``isolationist'' and his accusation that Helms drew up complicated 
government reorganization plans ``on the back of an envelope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood withdrew his name from consideration for the Brazil post  
in May.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Athlete a True Volunteer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- It's quite an understatement to say Blerta  
Lishi of Albania and her mother got some breathing room this week 
at the 1999 Special Olympics World Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two months, the Lishi family, at the request of  
Blerta, a 25-year-old mentally retarded sprinter, has shared its 
two-room house in Albania with six Kosovo refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	After sleeping on a crowded kitchen floor since March 29,  
Blerta's mother got to sleep in a bed when the Albanian delegation 
arrived in North Carolina last week for the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I slept on the floor like a true Albanian,'' said Hamide  
Lishi, 51, joking when asked about the 10 people who occupied her 
small house back home. ``This was a special occasion. I worked for 
27 years in a small village on a farm, I am strong. I could handle 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the soft mattress must have felt pretty darned good.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's wonderful. It's like night and day,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Lishi family took in the refugees after Blerta implored her  
mother to help the fleeing Kosovos as ethnic unrest and tensions 
mounted. About 860,000 ethnic Albanians fled Kosovo and Serb forces 
during the NATO air war that began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the first people from Kosovo came to Albania, my heart  
broke,'' said Blerta. ``I begged my family to take a family into 
our home, although we are not rich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's true. The Lishi household income is $140 a month in the  
poorest country in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really didn't think of it as being that difficult,'' said  
Mrs. Lishi. ``They were good people. Whatever we ate we put in 
front of them as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So for two months there was one shower and one sink shared by 10  
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Talk about volunteers and the spirit of volunteerism,'' said  
Martha Jo Braycich, media relations manager for Special Olympics 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees began heading home last Sunday, the day before  
Blerta and her mother flew to the United States for the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Braycich was in charge of finding a host town for the Albanians.  
She picked Warrenton, a town an hour north of the Research Triangle 
area near the North Carolina-Virginia border. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, only coaches and athletes are housed for the Games.  
But Braycich got a surprise one day when Rebecca Burgess, the host 
town director, called with some good news. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called her up one night, and she asked incredibly dignified  
questions about the Albanians and the situation. She had seen what 
was going on,'' Braycich said of Burgess. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had remarked, `Oh, what a nice lady.' Then one night she  
called me back and said, `We're going to take everybody.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the nine athletes, seven family members were also  
housed by volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so overwhelmed by that act of kindness that I burst into  
tears,'' said Braycich. ``I was so very moved by that. They took 
care of them for a couple of days. I knew they were in good 
hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Albanians have been concentrating on their competition  
here this week, they're also thinking of their homeland -- and 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though there are many problems in our land, we are still  
happy we have been able to come and represent our country in the 
Special Olympics,'' said Koko Gaba, head of the delegation. ``We 
want to show the world of our seriousness, our desire for peace and 
our desire for people to be happier in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that a solution appears to be coming we heard there was a  
great big meeting in the town square and people shouted: `Thank you 
very much, NATO, thank you very much, U.S.A.'''

<HEADLINE> Phelps Dodge To Lay Off 1,650 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Giant copper producer Phelps Dodge Corp. is  
cutting back operations and laying off 1,650 workers because of a 
worldwide slump in copper prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are facing the potential of an extended downturn in the  
price of copper and significant change and uncertainty in key 
global markets for wire and cable,'' Douglas C. Yearley, chairman 
and chief executive officer, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	During the third quarter, Phoenix-based Phelps Dodge will  
temporarily close its smelter at Hidalgo, N.M., and the smaller of 
two concentrators at its Morenci, Ariz., mining complex. The 
company also will slice production in half at its copper refinery 
in El Paso, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Those closures and cutbacks would result in the elimination of  
approximately 900 jobs, including 250 at Morenci. Another 670 jobs 
would be eliminated as Phelps Dodge curtails its wire and cable 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Broken Hill Propriety Co. Ltd. cited slumping copper  
prices for its decision to shutter its Arizona and Nevada 
operations, resulting in the elimination of 2,630 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper prices have slid from $1.18 a pound in 1996 to an average  
of 65 cents this year, partly because of overproduction and partly 
because of a slowdown in construction demand in Asia from the 
economic turmoil there. 
</P>
<P>
	However, copper futures have been edging higher on the New York  
Mercantile exchange amid hopes that the global supply glut will 
finally be easing. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge High Performance Conductors will close two small  
facilities in Montville and Fairfield, N.J.; Phelps Dodge Magnet 
Wire will close its plant in Hopkinsville, Ky.; and Phelps Dodge 
International Corp. will cease manufacturing in Educador and will 
close a small rod mill and magnet wire facility in Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	Those actions would lead to the elimination of 670 jobs.  
</P>
<P>
	Columbian Chemicals Co., Phelps Dodge's carbon black and  
specialty chemicals unit, will suspend operations at its 
Philippines plant on Dec. 31, eliminating 80 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also has agreed to sell its Witkop mine, its South  
African flurspar producer, to the South African Land &AMP; Exploration 
Co. Ltd. for total cash proceeds of $12.3 million. The sale is 
expected to close in early July.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive Financier May Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A financier sought in the disappearance  
of at least $300 million from several insurance companies has been 
negotiating his surrender, The Hartford Courant reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper, citing two sources it did not identify, said  
Martin Frankel is believed to be hiding in Europe, but has been in 
contact with federal prosecutors through a defense lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Attorney's Office in New Haven declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Interpol, the international police organization, has issued its  
highest alert to 177 member nations: a ``red notice'' to stop and 
arrest Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	The order was based on a sealed arrest warrant, signed by a  
federal judge in Bridgeport, accusing Frankel of wire fraud in 
connection with money he managed for 11 insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, 44, disappeared May 5 after a fire in a filing cabinet  
at his home in Greenwich. Authorities found a handwritten to-do 
list in the house that included ``Launder Money,'' according to an 
FBI affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators say insurers in Oklahoma, Mississippi, Tennessee,  
Missouri and Arkansas are missing over $300 million. A lawsuit 
filed by some of the companies put the loss at $915 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Also missing is as much as $1.98 billion from the St. Francis of  
Assisi Foundation, which Frankel established in the British Virgin 
Islands in August. Investigators suspect the charity was merely a 
front for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Police are also looking for at least a half-dozen people who  
worked out of Frankel's sprawling Greenwich home, part of which he 
converted into a securities trading floor, with 80 computers, 
satellite receivers and telephone banks.

<HEADLINE> Women's World Cup Outrates NHL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Women's World Cup has been around for less  
than two weeks and its television ratings are already better than 
the NHL's. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN has a .82 cable rating in five World Cup games so far  
compared with a .59 mark on its NHL regular-season games this past 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable network also has broadcast 17 Women's World Cup games  
on ESPN2, with a .51 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN's game last Thursday between the United States and Nigeria  
drew a 1.85 rating and was seen in 1.4 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
	As far as ratings go, the women have fallen short of their male  
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the United States played Colombia in the first round of  
the men's World Cup. The game on ESPN drew a 4.3 rating and was 
seen in 2.7 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN's average for 41 men's games in 1994, when the tournament  
was also held in the United States, was 1.8. The 1998 men's World 
Cup was in France, where many games fell in a poor time slot for 
Americans. ESPN had a .9 rating for 27 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Sunday's United States-North Korea women's game on ESPN2  
got a 1.96 rating and was seen in 1.3 million homes. It was the 
highest rating for any soccer match on ESPN2 and the fifth 
most-watched event on the network. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the United  
States tuned to a program. Each cable point represents 766,000 
homes on ESPN and 644,000 homes on ESPN2. The share is the 
percentage tuned to a program among televisions in use at the time.

<HEADLINE> Anthrax Inoculation May Be Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon has been paying below cost for  
anthrax vaccine shots that are to be taken by all 2.4 million 
military troops, a Defense Department official testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The only licensed producer of the vaccine, BioPort Corp. of  
Lansing, Mich., is in financial trouble and company executives want 
to triple the cost per shot to between $10 and $12 and deliver a 
smaller quantity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has made no decisions about BioPort's proposed  
contract changes, David R. Oliver, a deputy undersecretary of 
defense, told lawmakers on the House Government Reform subcommittee 
on national security. 
</P>
<P>
	But Oliver endorsed a price increase, saying he believed the  
Pentagon pressed too hard to cut costs and came up with a contract 
that wasn't fair to the producer given that the department was 
buying the shots below cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current pricing structure is unrealistic and  
unsustainable,'' said Fuad El-Hibri, BioPort's president and chief 
executive officer. ``The proposed average price per dose will 
compare favorably with the prices of many other vaccines purchased 
by the government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BioPort also is seeking a $10 million advance to pay off  
creditors and permission to sell up to 300,000 doses each year on 
the open market so the company can stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Company executives said that when they took over the  
vaccine-producing facility -- the Michigan Biologics Products 
Institute -- from the State of Michigan nine months ago, they 
underestimated the cost of production. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who chairs the subcommittee,  
called BioPort's business plan overly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Hibri said the state of Michigan has been losing about $5  
million annually subsidizing the lab BioPort took over, and Oliver 
said: ``The State of Michigan has been funding the Department of 
Defense for several years, and that's not right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louis J. Rodrigues, director of defense acquisition issues for  
the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, 
testified that BioPort ``is in an extremely bad financial 
position'' with ``a serious cash-flow problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those findings, said Shays, ``raise serious doubts BioPort can  
meet current contract commitments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen last year ordered all 2.4  
million active duty and reserve troops to get the anthrax vaccine 
as protection against biological warfare. Anthrax can be used as a 
weapon when spores are released into the air and people inhale 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 300,000 service members have been immunized, although  
some have refused out of safety concerns and face dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	BioPort wants to reduce by about 3 million the number of shots  
it provides the Pentagon under its three-year contract, federal 
officials said. Oliver said the Pentagon has enough to make it 
through August. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration in March 1997 found quality  
control deficiencies in the plant BioPort later took over. Last 
year, it underwent about $17 million in renovations and expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA must approve before BioPort can ship the Pentagon new  
vaccine shots. But Oliver said he had taken the new shots himself 
to demonstrate he is ``comfortable'' with the facility's quality 
control.

<HEADLINE> Bush Makes Appeal to Hollywood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hollywood is partly responsible for violent  
behavior by young movie viewers, GOP presidential candidate George 
W. Bush says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is a correlation between violence in movies and  
youth violence,'' Bush said Tuesday. ``But I also think there is a 
correlation between violence and drug use and alcohol abuse and 
lack of parental love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush says repeatedly on the stump that as president he would  
usher in a new era of personal responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Between fund-raisers Tuesday, he said the entertainment industry  
should help ring in that new era, and he hinted he would broach the 
subject of violence with Hollywood movers and shakers later in the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole point I'm going to make with the movie folks is that  
all of us need to work together to change the culture,'' he told a 
mob of reporters in San Diego. ``One industry alone does not bear 
all the brunt. All of us in society must do so, including the print 
media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush made his comments before a private meeting in the Bel Air  
section of Los Angeles at the home of Terry Semel, chairman and 
co-chief executive officer of Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
	He gingerly raised the subject of Hollywood and violence to his  
audience there, according to spokeswoman Karen Hughes. The event 
was closed to the news media; Hughes transcribed Bush's remarks and 
provided them to reporters later. 
</P>
<P>
	``My job is not to hold somebody up for scorn,'' the Republican  
front-runner for the presidential nomination told more than 100 
Hollywood executives, producers and actors. 
</P>
<P>
	``My job is to appeal to people from all parts of society, to  
call on all of us to do our part to usher in the responsibility 
era,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I win, I'll see you at the White House,'' Bush told  
listeners. ``If I lose, I'll see you at your movie theaters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Semel, the host, was among those who huddled behind closed doors  
last month with Motion Picture Association of America President 
Jack Valenti to talk about Washington efforts to hold the 
entertainment industry accountable for schoolyard violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Semel and film producer Jerry Weintraub were among those listed  
as ``dinner chairmen'' at a Bush fund-raiser in Los Angeles Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Weintraub produced ``Soldier,'' a film released last year that  
envisioned a future in which newborn babies are snatched from their 
cradles and trained to become as professional killers. 
</P>
<P>
	An Associated Press reviewer called the film ``an orgy of  
slaughter and explosion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weintraub and Valenti attended the meeting at Semel's house  
Tuesday, as did actor Warren Beatty, a diehard liberal. 
</P>
<P>
	So did Sherry Lansing, chairwoman of Paramount Motion Picture  
Group and director-producer Jerry Bruckheimer. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Tuesday night, Bush picked up $2.3 million from some 2,000  
donors in Century City, near the heart of the entertainment 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent about an hour mingling with the donors in a ballroom so  
jammed that organizers had to set tables on the stage.

<HEADLINE> Music Makers: Valerie Capers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The floor vibrates, the walls shake and the  
furniture moves a little to the music in Valerie Capers' home. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the lady plays jazz.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you can't feel it, it's not being played right,'' she says.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Capers ought to know. Blind since age 6, the pianist has  
felt her way through a career that has spanned the musical scale -- 
from classical cantatas to swinging jazz -- with performances 
alongside Dizzy Gillespie and Wynton Marsalis. 
</P>
<P>
	While everybody has heard of her famous performing partners, few  
outside jazz circles know of The Valerie Capers Ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet her musical mark can be heard in such standards as Mongo  
Santamaria's hit ``El Toro,'' which she composed and arranged for 
the Latin jazz king, and ``Sing About Love,'' her Christmas jazz 
cantata that played to sold-out audiences from Carnegie Hall to The 
Hague. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't blame it on anybody. I think it's just fate,'' she  
says in a recent interview at her apartment in the Bronx. 
``Sometimes you strike gold, sometimes you don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not for lack of trying. She has released four records since  
1967, performed at various jazz festivals and concert halls and 
been featured on Columbia's ``Legendary Pioneers of Jazz'' series. 
</P>
<P>
	Now at 63, Ms. Capers may have her first commercial hit.  
</P>
<P>
	She has partnered with a renowned -- and dead -- classical  
composer for her most challenging work to date: putting Richard 
Wagner's ``Der Ring der Nibelungen'' to jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is ``Wagner Takes the A Train,'' a fiery, up-tempo  
instrumental in which she cleverly combines recognizable Wagnerian 
strains with elements of jazz, resulting in a classical piece that 
plays to the soul. 
</P>
<P>
	The album by the same name -- released this month by Elysium  
Records -- includes several other Wagner-influenced compositions and 
some jazz standards, such as Thelonious Monk's meditative ``Round 
Midnight'' and Charlie Parker's bebop classic, ``Confirmation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow performers say the album reflects Ms. Caper's ability to  
successfully combine unthinkable musical elements. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a woman who hired a string section that played with a  
jazz band and a choir ... to perform `Sing About Love.' She's just 
so fluent in both disciplines,'' said violinist Maxine Roach, 
daughter of famed drummer Max Roach. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's breaking down barriers -- musically and personally,'' Ms.  
Roach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Born and reared in the Bronx, Ms. Capers began playing the piano  
``almost as soon as I could reach the keys'' under the tutelage of 
her father, a ragtime pianist whose friends included Fats Waller. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my house, there was always jazz music. First my dad and  
later my brother. It was just kind of natural thing -- to play 
music,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But it wasn't until she lost her eyesight from an untreated  
infection and began attending the New York Institute for Education 
of the Blind that she started developing her classical repertoire -- 
and her passion for Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could only play music by ear. I used to beg the music  
teacher to play the piece so I could hear how it sounded and then 
repeat it. But she knew I wanted to hear so I didn't have to study 
it,'' Ms. Capers said, breaking into a broad smile. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1960, she became the first blind graduate of the Juilliard  
School of Music. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got out of school and said, `OK, now what?''' she recalled.  
</P>
<P>
	That's when her brother, Bobby Capers, a saxophonist and flutist  
in Santamaria's Afro-Cuban band, encouraged her to pursue jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kept saying, `You're not using your imagination. Anybody  
can play that,''' Ms. Capers said. ``He also felt that we as 
African-Americans were responsible for one of the greatest art 
forms ever to come out of mankind and we had a responsibility to 
carry it on. It was kind of like an ethnic pride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She struggled at first, trying to find her jazz voice.  
</P>
<P>
	Today, sitting in the dining room of her dimly lighted  
apartment, Ms. Capers can point to the day in 1962 when she found 
it -- with the release of John Coltrane's critically acclaimed 
``Giant Steps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It changed the way people played jazz. It changed the  
structure. It changed the voice. It changed everything,'' she said. 
``I used to sit and play along with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, in 1967 she released ``Portrait in Soul'' (Atlantic  
Records), which was well-received but not a commercial success. 
Atlantic did not ask for another album and, in 1982, she put out 
``Affirmation'' under her own label, KMA Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt that this was the best work I had ever done, and I was  
just going to put it out there for people. For those who liked it, 
wonderful,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillespie was quoted as saying the album was ``sheer delight.''  
But again, it didn't sell big. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995 came ``Come on Home'' (Columbia) -- another miss.  
</P>
<P>
	Between albums, Ms. Capers worked as a professor of music at  
Bronx Community College, where she is now artist-in-residence. 
There she was able to join her classical training to her love of 
jazz, and to recruit most of the musicians who make up her 
ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, she plays with bassist John Robinson, drummer Earl  
Williams, saxophonist and flutist Alan Givens and guitarist Mark 
Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	Her latest album was seven years in the making, beginning with a  
1992 trip to Wagner's home in Bayreuth, Germany, where she sat on 
the couch on which the composer died. 
</P>
<P>
	When she left Bayreuth, she knew it was time to meld her musical  
loves. ``It's like all my work -- both as an educator and a musician 
-- have come full circle with this CD,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wagner Takes the A Train'' has been ranked in the top 10 play  
list by jazz radio stations, and Ms. Capers said that if she would 
be remembered for anything, it would probably be this music. 
</P>
<P>
	``The things I have composed will give me a crumb of  
immortality,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Pols Woo Farmers for Their Votes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The agriculture spending bill appears ready  
again for legislative action after lawmakers ended a deadlock over 
patients' rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending bill had been delayed for more than a week as  
Democrats pushed the measure that would set new controls on managed 
health care plans. Under a compromise reached between Republicans 
and Democrats on Tuesday, lawmakers agreed to take up the 
legislation when they return from the July 4 holiday. The farm 
measure is scheduled to come up before week's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, Republicans and Democrats intensified the fight  
for farmers' votes in the 2000 election and accused each other of 
ignoring rural America. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may be writing off rural areas but not me,'' declared  
Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., chairman of the National Republican 
Congressional Committee. ``The rural areas are one of the backbones 
of our party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Countered Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., ``Their position is  
laughable. It's the Democrats in Congress that have led the fight 
for family farmers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear that Republicans are trying to market themselves as  
pro-farmer but the record shows they have turned their backs on 
rural America time and time again,'' said John Del Cecato, 
spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, 31 Republican House members and the Republican  
Governors Association sent separate letters Tuesday to Senate 
Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, encouraging him to 
push Democrats to pass the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply concerned and frankly surprised by your tactics  
... your obstruction of this bill to promote your own political 
agenda,'' the Republican governors wrote. ``We urge you to abandon 
this careless tactic.''

<HEADLINE> Sydney OKs Equestrian Olympic Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Equestrian events at next year's Sydney  
Olympics will go ahead as planned following a quarantine agreement 
between organizers SOCOG and the Australian government. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's strict quarantine laws stopped equestrian events  
being held in Melbourne during the 1956 Olympics and they were 
moved to Stockholm, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture minister Mark Vaile said Wednesday the agreement  
between SOCOG and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service 
set out guidelines for the inspection of the expected 260 
international horses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Advances in disease testing, risk analysis and management will  
allow the safe importation of horses from competing countries with 
existing protocols in place,'' Vaile said. ``With the signing of 
today's historic agreement, modern quarantine procedures mean that 
we can stage one of the world's most important events while 
protecting Australia's horse industry from threats such as equine 
influenza.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The horses will arrive on special SOCOG-chartered flights in  
late August next year and be put in quarantine at the Sydney 
International Equestrian Center for a minimum of two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The new procedures will allow international competitors to  
arrive two weeks in advance and begin their training. In the past, 
the quarantine would have meant the horses were kept in pens, and 
unable to prepare for the Olympics

<HEADLINE> Clinton: I'll Aid N. Ireland Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- President Clinton beseeched the British and Irish  
today to ``give peace a chance,'' as they worked against a midnight 
deadline to save the Northern Ireland peace pact. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, speaking to reporters after a speech in Chicago, said  
he stands ready to become personally involved in the deadlocked 
talks in Belfast, if he is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will do whatever I can to be helpful. We're moving forward  
and I'm hoping for the best,'' said Clinton, who was receiving 
regular updates from his deputy national security adviser, James 
Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
	The prime ministers of Britain and Ireland have been locked in  
talks with political leaders of Northern Ireland, trying to agree 
on a formula for setting up the new local government -- agreed to in 
last year's celebrated Good Friday Accords -- and disarming the 
Irish Republican Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton asked the parties today not to let the pact fall apart  
before it even has a chance to succeed or fail. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still a good deal and they need to find a way to go  
forward. If anybody fails to fulfill any condition ... at any time 
in the future by the appropriate deadlines, it can always be taken 
down,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it shouldn't be taken down in the absence of a failure to  
fulfill the basic conditions. We should go forward and give peace a 
chance.''

<HEADLINE> Bulls Select Brand, Artest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- The future of the Chicago Bulls is Elton  
Brand. 
</P>
<P>
	With the first pick in Wednesday's draft, the  
six-time-champions-turned-cellar-dwellars chose Brand, the college 
player of the year. It was Chicago's first-ever No. 1 pick, and 
he'll be the cornerstone as the Bulls try to rebuild their 
shattered dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was totally surprised,'' Brand said in a teleconference from  
Washington, D.C., where the draft was held. ``It was a great 
feeling. I'm still totally elated right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls picked Brand after a late flirtation with Lamar Odom,  
whose ``Yes, I'm in the draft. No, wait a minute, I'm not,'' 
flip-flop two weeks ago confused many teams. He blew off workouts 
and, until last weekend, no team but Vancouver had talked to him. 
</P>
<P>
	But Odom finally came to Chicago for a workout Tuesday night.  
</P>
<P>
	``We felt if we did not face Lamar and talk to him, then we  
really didn't have a comparison between him and Elton,'' general 
manager Jerry Krause said. ``You know, in an election, you wait 
until all the precincts were in before you make a decision. We 
waited until all of the precincts were in, until we could look at 
everybody, and talk to everybody and then we made our decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When commissioner David Stern called Brand's name, the forward  
from Duke sighed and a huge grin crossed his face. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still was very confident in my skills and work ethic and the  
way I played,'' Brand said. ``I think the GMs and coaches were 
pleasantly surprised in my skills. I didn't get to showcase them 
all at Duke this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Say what? Brand, 20, was the first player ever to leave Duke as  
an underclassman. As a sophomore, he averaged 16.2 points and 9.8 
rebounds to lead the Blue Devils into the NCAA championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial concerns about his height were erased when he measured  
just over 6-8 without his sneakers. His arm span is huge; he's got 
a vertical reach of over nine feet, and his horizontal span is 
7-5 1/2. At 260 pounds, he can play defense with the best of them, but 
he's got soft hands, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a building block here,'' Krause said. ``He's a player I  
think you can win with down the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he's going to have to play right away. Brand has been  
working out with a personal trainer the last few weeks, and he 
knows how much is expected of him. After six championships in eight 
years, the Bulls finished 13-37 this year, the worst record in 
franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	With no Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen or Dennis Rodman, the  
Bulls reached all kinds of new lowlights. Their .260 winning 
percentage was the lowest in franchise history, beating out the 
1975-76 squad, which finished 24-58 with a .293 winning percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	Their average of 81.9 points was the lowest scoring average in  
NBA history since the inception of the shot clock. Entering this 
season, the lowest average was 87.4 points in 72 games by the 
Milwaukee Hawks in 1954-55, the season the clock was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	That's going to change, Brand said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely going to show some patience,'' Brand said.  
``Help rebuild the Chicago Bulls and get them back to where they 
should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls also had the 16th pick in the first round, and took  
Ron Artest, a 6-7 guard-forward from St. John's. With their 
second-round picks, Chicago took Tulsa forward Michael Ruffin (32) 
and Massachusetts center-forward Lari Ketner (49). 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just so happy right now,'' Artest said, tears rolling down  
his cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 pick is the highest the Bulls have had. They've had  
the No. 2 spot twice, taking David Greenwood in 1979 and Scott May 
three years earlier. They've had the third pick twice, also, using 
one of them to take Jordan in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Their last ``important'' pick was way back in 1989, when Chicago  
had the sixth pick and took Stacey King.

<HEADLINE> Women's World Cup Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Russia is going the distance for the Women's World Cup,  
literally. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians have been complaining about a grueling travel  
schedule, claiming the scheduling of the tournament favored the 
United States. If you look at the mileage, the team might have a 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia started in Foxboro, Mass., then traveled to Portland,  
Ore. From there it was on to Giants Stadium in New Jersey, and 
Wednesday the Russians were in San Jose, Calif., for the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	If they go through to the semifinal, they'll have to fly back to  
Boston, and if they make it through the final, another 
cross-country trip will be required. The final is being held in the 
Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. In three weeks, they will have 
traveled 15,156 miles and made five cross-country trips 
</P>
<P>
	If China makes it to the final, the team will have traveled  
12,673 miles and weathered four cross-country trips. Another 
favorite, Norway, will have to cover 9,471 miles and make three 
cross-country trips. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States mileage looks like a walk in the park, by  
comparison. If the team makes the final, it will have traveled only 
5,498 miles and made only one cross-country trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizing committee president Marla Messing said the Women's  
World Cup had met FIFA demands about the travel requirements ``to 
the extent feasible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think on the whole, in the context of the event taking place  
in the United States, the travel schedule is fair,'' she said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	 *ALL-STAR FINALISTS:* Nine players for the United States team,  
including forwards Mia Hamm and Tiffeny Milbrett, are finalists for 
the Mastercard Women's World Cup All-Star Team. The players are 
picked by the FIFA Technical Study Group, which also will make the 
final selection of the 16-member all-star team. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Prosecutor Faces Murder Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOSHEN, N.Y. (AP) -- An assistant district attorney was charged  
Wednesday with murder for allegedly running down a roller skater, 
then driving a half-mile with the body on the hood of his car. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Harnisch faces second-degree murder charges in the death  
Saturday of Edwin Quirk, 40, who was skating with his wife on a 
path that is supposed to be free when he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Harnisch, 39, drove his car onto a bike path in  
Chester, hit Quirk and injured his wife, then continued for about a 
half mile with Quirk on the hood. He allegedly stopped his car, 
stole a parked car and drove a short distance before he was stopped 
by police. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Saturday, Harnisch's family called police to say  
Harnisch was manic depressive and had not been taking his 
medication, the Middletown Times Herald Record reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Harnisch spent 10 years in the office of the Manhattan district  
attorney before he was hired in Orange County in 1997.

<HEADLINE> La Nina Seems To Be Vanishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The weather-altering La Nina phenomenon  
has all but vanished from the Pacific Ocean, according to NASA 
satellite observations. 
</P>
<P>
	The pool of unusually cool tropical water marked by low sea  
levels has shriveled and the equatorial Pacific is warming to 
normal temperatures, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists cautioned that like its warm counterpart, El Nino, a  
La Nina condition will influence global climate and weather until 
it has completely subsided. La Nina has shrunk several times and 
then had a resurgence over the past 12 months, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the United States, an El Nino brings unusually warm  
temperatures to the northern states and cooler, wetter conditions 
to the South. 
</P>
<P>
	La Nina is linked to cooler conditions in central North America,  
and dry, warm conditions in the southern states.

<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Builder Marts of America is joining with  
Ace Hardware Corp. to form what they say will be the nation's 
largest wholesale buying and distribution group in the lumber and 
building materials industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, with annual direct sales of $1.2 billion, will  
be headquartered in Greenville, the companies said Wednesday. The 
deal should be completed by the end of the summer, Ace spokeswoman 
Paula Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, to be named later, will serve more than 2,700  
retail locations throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've effectively assembled a new company that will provide  
greater buying power for independent retailers,'' said David 
Hodnik, Ace's president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Ace's lumber and building materials division is joining Builder  
Mart to form the new company. Ace, headquartered in Oak Brook, 
Ill., will continue to operate its hardware business separately, 
Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Guardian Fiberglass, based in Albion, Mich., became the largest  
shareholder of Builder Mart in August. All three companies have 
focused primarily on independent lumber dealers and home centers.

<HEADLINE> Madonna Sues Ex-Financial Advisers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Material Girl is suing her former financial  
advisers after state taxes took a bite out of her assets. 
</P>
<P>
	In a $2.5 million lawsuit filed in state court on Tuesday,  
Madonna accused Padell, Nadell, Fine, Weinberger &AMP; Co. of 
malpractice and breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Bert Padell, the firm's senior partner, said the $2.5 million  
lawsuit stems from Madonna's having to pay $2 million in New York 
state income taxes after he prepared a 1992 tax filing saying she 
was a California resident. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state came in and said she was a New York state resident  
because she lived here more than 183 days'' in that tax year, and 
that made her subject to New York's income taxes, Padell said. 
Madonna paid the taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Madonna fired him in 1996, but Padell said he still thinks she  
is ``a good person. I have no malice toward her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which names Madonna's personal corporation and her  
record company as plaintiffs, asks $2 million in compensatory 
damages and $500,000 in punitive damages.

<HEADLINE> Rating Bars Teens From 'South Park' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Half-baked as it was, this was 16-year-old  
Jose Tamayo's plan: Get past the warning sign, the ticket-taker at 
the box office, the monitor at the theater door and into the 
R-rated ``South Park'' movie. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't work.  
</P>
<P>
	As he was turned away from the Galaxy Theater on Hollywood  
Boulevard, Tamayo grumbled, ``I don't know what the big deal is,'' 
and vowed to try to get into the show in another theater somewhere 
else in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut,'' a raunchfest of dirty  
words and bodily functions, opened Wednesday, and across the 
country it was life imitating art: Theaters had to turn away 
children trying to sneak into a vulgar movie about children who 
sneak into a vulgar movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The strict enforcement of the R rating, which bars anyone under  
17 without an adult, was the result of an agreement worked out 
recently between President Clinton and major theater owners in 
reaction to the Littleton, Colo., school massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	This twisted movie -- which has received glowing reviews -- is  
more about dirty words than dirty deeds. It thereby thumbs its nose 
-- or, more accurately, flashes a particular digit -- at a movie 
rating system that prohibits kids from seeing foul-mouthed, cartoon 
8-year-olds but lets them view scenes of death and destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Filled with raunchy dialogue about sex, jokes about bodily  
functions and profanity that would make a sailor blush, ``South 
Park'' -- based on the controversial TV series on cable's Comedy 
Central -- had to go through several edits before it could get down 
from an NC-17 to an R rating. (An NC-17 rating means no one under 
17 allowed, not even with an adult.) 
</P>
<P>
	``The ratings board only cared about the dirty words. They're so  
confused and arbitrary,'' Trey Parker, who with partner Matt Stone 
created ``South Park,'' told The New York Times. ``They don't blink 
twice because of violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parker and Stone clashed before with the ratings board when it  
gave their pornography industry farce ``Orgazmo'' an NC-17 last 
year even though the movie had no explicit sex scenes and only 
fleeting nudity. 
</P>
<P>
	This time around, they said, the only reason they won an R was  
that a major studio -- Paramount -- was behind ``South Park'' and is 
also a member of the industry group that handles the ratings, the 
Motion Picture Association of America. (``Orgazmo'' was an 
independent production.) 
</P>
<P>
	It's a claim Paramount dismisses.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way that the MPAA treats a studio different from  
anybody else,'' said Robert Friedman, vice chairman of the 
Paramount Motion Picture Group. ``You go through the exact same 
process, with the exact same people, sitting in judgment of what 
they think is right or wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Valenti, president of the MPAA, didn't return messages  
seeking comment, but in the past he has strongly defended the 
integrity of the ratings process, while acknowledging that 
decisions are subjective. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the ``South Park'' filmmakers agreed that parents should  
probably be with their kids at the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``The R rating is perfect,'' Parker told the Los Angeles Times.  
</P>
<P>
	Tony Fox, a spokesman for Comedy Central, which has aired  
``South Park'' since 1997, said the program -- shown at 10 p.m. on 
Wednesdays -- is positioned for adults. But he acknowledged that 
about 20 percent of the show's audience is under 18. 
</P>
<P>
	And so it was, at the Wynnsong 10 theater in Little Rock, Ark.,  
that 46-year-old Gary Bradberry accompanied his 12-year-old son to 
``South Park.'' The elder Bradberry explained that he and his son 
both watch the TV show and discuss troubling scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like it,'' he said. ``It's a change from all other shows on  
TV.''

	Hubbell Scheduled To Plead Guilty  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sources say former Clinton business partner  
and Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell will plead guilty 
today to a misdemeanor tax charge, and to a felony for hiding the 
legal work he did on a fraudulent Arkansas land deal from federal 
investigators. The plea could be one of the final chapters in 
Kenneth Starr's investigation of the Clintons and Whitewater. 
Hubbell has already spent 16 months in prison on separate tax 
evasion and mail fraud charges. It's unclear if he will provide any 
details of Hillary Clinton's role in Whitewater.

Republican nomination in 2000. The former head of the American Red

presidential campaign. Senior Republican officials said last week 
Bush was expected to report today at least $23 million in 
contributions. Gore yesterday said he collected $18.2 million to 
$18.5 million in the first six months of the campaign. His only 
rival, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, will report more than

estimates, Phoenix became the nation's seventh most populous city

	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Expect long lines today at many

into neighboring states to play. One convenience store owner in 
Milwaukee said a customer bought 275 tickets. If there's a winner,

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve is expected raise interest

rapidly for its own good. Analysts say based on recent remarks from 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, there is little doubt that 
the panel that sets interest rates will announce an increase. Under 
Greenspan, the Fed has preferred to raise interest rates before 
higher inflation has a chance to take off. In the past, Fed 
policy-makers waited too long to start raising rates, eventually 
knocking the economy into a recession.

Venus Willams, who rallied to beat Anna Kournikova 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Plan Spending, Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's forecast of $1 trillion in  
added budget surpluses is not changing Republican efforts to heed 
two-year-old spending limits -- at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is whetting GOP appetites for tax-cutting, prompting  
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, and 
others to say their plans for a $778 billion, 10-year tax cut are 
about to expand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be able to do more'' than planned, Archer said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	A day after Clinton released the new surplus projection, the  
House Appropriations Committee proceeded as if nothing had 
happened. One of its subcommittees produced a $14.1 billion measure 
financing federal land and arts programs next year, $1.1 billion 
less than Clinton requested. 
</P>
<P>
	In so doing, Republicans continued their drive to keep spending  
at limits required by the 1997 budget-balancing pact between 
lawmakers and Clinton -- limits that Democrats and even many 
Republicans say are too low. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does the expression `When hell freezes over' mean anything to  
you?'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, when asked 
when he would agree to use the new surpluses for higher spending. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's not necessarily going to be the GOP position by  
year's end. Most participants concede that eventually, Republicans 
will compromise with Clinton and provide some of the extra spending 
he wants, perhaps in return for tax cuts or in a big budget deal 
that includes changes in Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who said he  
wants to use the additional surpluses for tax cuts, said that when 
it comes to using some of the extra money for higher spending, 
``I'm not going to prohibit anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's spending cuts and tax-cut talk underlined GOP  
determination to use the growing surplus projections for their own 
priorities -- tax reductions -- and not Clinton's plans for domestic 
initiatives. The moves could serve as an opening gambit for budget 
talks that might occur this year or as a clear statement of 
principles for Republicans already planning for the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's activity also illustrated that lawmakers are feeling  
their way through the politics of an era undreamt of even two years 
ago -- huge projected money surpluses stretching to the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Armey's insistent opposition to raising spending limits,  
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, 
said he was ready to do just that. He told reporters that with the 
new surplus projections, it is time for congressional leaders to 
negotiate new and higher spending limits with the Clinton 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time that old agreement was made, they didn't see $1  
trillion ahead of us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said  
Clinton's surplus projections as expected would be closely tracked 
by Congressional Budget Office estimates due Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBO, which Congress uses to write bills, will project a  
fiscal 2000 surplus of $10 billion to $15 billion, Domenici said, 
excluding the vast Social Security surpluses that have created 
overall budget surpluses last year and this year. The White House 
projected a $5 billion figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici said over the next decade, CBO's non-Social Security  
surplus would be $300 billion to $350 billion higher than was 
thought, mirroring the administration's $333 billion figure. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House land and cultural programs bill, Clinton's touted  
``lands legacy'' program was cut from close to $800 million to 
about $200 million. The budgets of the national endowments for the 
arts and the humanities were held at $98 million and $111 million, 
well below the $150 million Clinton wanted for each. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would increase spending for national park maintenance  
and Indian Health Service programs. It also would provide less than 
Clinton wanted for protecting Florida's Everglades and for the 
first time would require state contributions to a federal program 
that helps poor people winterize their homes.

<HEADLINE> Rain Replaces Fire for Pepsi 400 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A year ago, Daytona Beach was  
desperately in need of a rainstorm. This week, the area hopes to 
avoid them. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray skies over Daytona gave way to a thunderstorm Wednesday  
evening. The rain came at about the same time pole qualifying for 
the Pepsi 400 is scheduled to begin tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	The race is Saturday night, to be followed by a fireworks  
display. All the festivities were canceled on July 4 of last year 
when forest fires blazed out of control through Florida, coming 
dangerously close to the Daytona International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened was not in our control,'' track vice president  
Andrew Gurtis said. ``I don't think we live in fear of it. But 
having gone through it, we don't want to have to go through it 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fire danger has diminished this year, replaced by a chance  
of showers all week. Saturday's forecast calls for a 30 percent 
chance of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's race was delayed three months. When the race was  
run, Jeff Gordon edged Bobby Labonte for his second Pepsi 400 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Gordon won the Daytona 500, giving him a chance for  
a third straight victory at Daytona and a rare sweep of the races 
at NASCAR's most famous track. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Fireball Roberts (1962), Cale Yarborough (1968), LeeRoy  
Yarborough (1969) and Bobby Allison (1982) have won both Daytona 
races in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning a second consecutive Pepsi 400 coming off a win in the  
Daytona 500 -- there's not much that could beat that,'' said Gordon, 
the two-time defending Winston Cup champion. ``That would 
definitely be a highlight in my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The speedway is still reaping the benefits from lighting the  
track, capitalizing on NASCAR's popularity and transforming the 
race from a 95-degree, mid-afternoon scorcher into something more 
palatable for fans and drivers alike. 
</P>
<P>
	The lights cost between $2 million and $3 million and made the  
raceway home of the biggest lighting project in the history of 
sports. Lighting the speedway uses the same amount of power needed 
to light 24,285 blocks of residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason it works is that this place is spectacular under  
the lights,'' Gurtis said. ``Those cars, the overall experience of 
a nighttime sporting event, is pretty powerful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the roots of stock car racing trace back to night  
racing under the lights at small local tracks, this is lighting on 
the grandest scale. 
</P>
<P>
	``A night race under the lights on the Fourth of July weekend,  
you just can't get much better than that,'' driver Jerry Nadeau 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The change in scenery does, however, leave room for concern.  
</P>
<P>
	``At night, there's shadows and reflections you don't get during  
the day,'' said 1997 champion John Andretti, the last driver to win 
the Pepsi 400 during the daytime. ``The race track is different, 
but it's still slippery. During the day, the sun is out and the 
heat bakes it and oils seep through. At night, the humidity is so 
thick it's slick. I thought it would be easier, but it's still a 
little slick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barring a storm, the Pepsi 400 will be televised on CBS, marking  
the first prime-time network telecast of a NASCAR race. The 1998 
race was scheduled for the network, but CBS passed after fires 
forced the race to be rescheduled for Oct. 17, the middle of 
football season.

<HEADLINE> NYSE Agrees To Oversee Floor Brokers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The New York Stock Exchange has agreed to  
improve oversight of brokers on its trading floor, in response to 
federal regulators' allegations that the NYSE failed to enforce 
laws barring the brokers from making trades that profited them 
personally. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday announced the  
allegations and a settlement of them in which the NYSE neither 
admitted to nor denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE, the world's largest stock exchange, isn't subject to  
any administrative censure or fines under the settlement with the 
SEC, a point stressed by NYSE officials during a news conference in 
New York after the SEC announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been one of the most difficult challenges we have  
faced,'' said Richard Grasso, NYSE chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public holds this institution to a higher standard, and  
appropriately so. Anytime you hear about an infraction by one, five 
or eight individuals, that's one, five or eight too many,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said the exchange failed to detect and stop illegal  
trading by floor brokers from 1993 to 1998, noting that the NYSE 
suspended routine independent surveillance for extensive periods, 
including a two-year stretch between 1995 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe we made a resource allocation that was  
appropriate,'' said Edward Kwalwasser, NYSE group executive vice 
president for regulatory affairs, defending the exchange's decision 
to ease surveillance during those periods. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the settlement, the NYSE has agreed to step up its  
oversight, at a cost of about $2 million, Grasso said. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1998, the SEC and federal criminal prosecutors  
charged two owners of brokerage firm Oakford Corp. and eight NYSE 
floor brokers with conspiring to illegally book personal trades. 
The scheme allegedly netted $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	They were charged with violating a law designed to prevent  
insider trading by brokers who have access to front-line 
information by being on the floor of the exchange. It was the first 
time federal prosecutors and the SEC pressed charges against anyone 
for making such personal trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwalwasser said those charged in the case ``were falsifying  
books and records, and were doing on-floor trading on these books 
and records. The SEC never could have alleged that we at the 
exchange could have condoned any of these activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC's action Tuesday was part of an effort to strengthen  
investor confidence in the fairness of U.S. stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This action underscores that self-regulatory organizations  
such as the New York Stock Exchange must vigilantly enforce the 
federal securities laws and their own rules,'' SEC Enforcement 
Director Richard Walker said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the SEC fined 28 brokerages more than $26 million  
for alleged price-fixing on the Nasdaq Stock Market, closing a 
5-year-old case in which big Wall Street firms were accused of 
cheating investors out of billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the American Stock Exchange -- which recently merged with  
Nasdaq -- has been facing a Justice Department investigation of 
alleged price-fixing in options trading by exchange specialists and 
traders. Exchange officials have denied trading irregularities in 
connection with the federal probe.

<HEADLINE>  Hubbell Pleads Guilty in Starr Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prosecutor Kenneth Starr today wrapped up the  
Arkansas phase of his five-year investigation with two fresh guilty 
pleas from longtime presidential friend Webster Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
	``After five years, it's over. Our lives can begin again,''  
Hubbell said outside the courthouse after being sentenced to one 
year of probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell pleaded guilty to concealing information from regulators  
about his firm's work for the savings and loan at the center of the 
Whitewater investigation and said he had been interviewed anew by 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the office of independent counsel, as I told them five  
years ago, that I have no knowledge of any wrongdoing on behalf of 
the president or Mrs. Clinton,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, prosecutors asked for no jail time,  
restitution or fine for the felony or a second guilty plea by 
Hubbell on a misdemeanor charge of failure to pay taxes. Hubbell 
previously served a 16-month prison sentence for bilking his law 
firm and his clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Both inside and outside court, Starr gave indications he is  
trying to wrap up the rest of his probe quickly. The prosecutor 
said the Arkansas phase of the investigation ``has been concluded 
by today's activities'' and that he is trying to bring other 
aspects of the probe to ``an orderly conclusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said certain matters remain under investigation by a  
federal grand jury. He was not more specific. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell pleaded guilty to a broad concealment charge alleging he  
hid from investigators his and Hillary Rodham Clinton's legal work 
for the failed Madison Guaranty Savings &AMP; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the court, the former associate attorney general  
declared he had only admitted to one facet of that charge -- that he 
had failed to disclose to federal regulators a potential conflict 
of interest before doing work for the government concerning 
Madison. 
</P>
<P>
	But Starr said his office would have been able to prove all the  
allegations underlying the concealment charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor told the judge, however, that he arranged the  
plea deal in part because the contoversy over his investigation had 
``found its way into the hearts and minds of prospective jurors'' 
and could have affected the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, press secretary Joe Lockhart said, ``The president  
and first lady recognize that these past few years have been very 
difficult ones for Webb and Suzy Hubbell, and they hope that this 
resolution will allow the Hubbells to move on to a brighter 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell's plea before U.S. District Judge James Robertson halted  
plans for a trial next month that could have been embarrassing for 
Mrs. Clinton as she explores whether to run for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	And it ended two separate criminal cases brought last year  
against Hubbell, who already has served 16 months in prison for an 
earlier guilty plea in Starr's probe. 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, Hubbell was accused of covering up his and Mrs.  
Clinton's legal work on a 1,050-acre land development south of 
Little Rock owned by Mrs. Clinton's Whitewater partner, Jim 
McDougal, and Hubbell's father-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	The land deal -- which federal regulators said was riddled with  
sham transactions -- cost the failing savings and loan owned by the 
Clintons' Whitewater partner $3.8 million and contributed to the 
insolvency of the institution. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax indictment, Hubbell was accused of failing to declare  
as income $74,000 of more than $450,000 in fees from 15 employers 
in 1994, when top Clinton advisers arranged consulting contracts 
for the former associate attorney general from Vernon Jordan and 
other close friends of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, he pleaded guilty to another charge of failing to pay  
taxes that superseded that indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell had promised to fully cooperate with Starr's  
investigation when he pleaded guilty in 1994 to stealing $400,000 
from his Arkansas law firm and its clients. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hubbell's memory lapses about key events in the Whitewater  
saga slowed the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Two events renewed Starr's interest in Hubbell in 1996.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's law-firm billing records emerged under  
still-unexplained circumstances inside the White House, revealing 
her work and Hubbell's on the fraudulent land development south of 
Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	And Starr discovered the financial assistance to Hubbell  
arranged by the president's friends, which raised the specter of 
``hush money.''

<HEADLINE> EU To Probe Formula One Racing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Bernie Ecclestone, the most powerful  
man in European auto racing, has been told that the federation 
which runs the Formula One circuit is being investigated for 
``abusing its dominant position and restricting competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union's executive commission said it gave similar  
warnings to two Ecclestone-controlled companies, which are involved 
in the selling and marketing of broadcast rights to major 
international races. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecclestone is chief of FIA, which runs Formula One.  
</P>
<P>
	The commission said one of the most significant conclusions of  
its preliminary investigation is that commercial contracts 
concerning the auto sports business, particularly those involving 
broadcasters, infringed European Union competition law. 
</P>
<P>
	``These contracts would therefore have to be renegotiated if the  
Commission's view is ultimately confirmed,'' the EC statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reopening the contracts could seriously hamper Ecclestone's  
plans to finance his business, since he received a $1.4 billion 
eurobond issue based on those rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue was underwritten by Morgan Stanley of the United  
States and Germany's Westdeutsche Landesbank. 
</P>
<P>
	It was scaled back from a planned $2 billion eurobond deal after  
investors failed to show enough enthusiasm for that amount. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry also concluded that the Federation Internationale de  
l'Automobile (FIA) abused its dominant hold over motor racing to 
restrict competition. 
</P>
<P>
	It did this, said EU spokesmen, by requiring Formula One  
competitors and business partners to have licenses with FIA, which 
it could cancel if they dealt with any competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	FIA also threatened to pull its business from any track that had  
a competing race, the EC said. 
</P>
<P>
	FIA blocked the start-up of a proposed GT touring car race  
circuit by these means, on the grounds that it would compete with 
FIA events, according to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The EC move to a formal investigation came after two years of  
informal work on the issue, during which it received two formal 
complaints and ``many'' informal complaints about FIA's tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	FIA, and Ecclestone's two companies, Formula One Administration  
and International Sportsworld Communicators, will now have to reply 
to the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	The maximum penalty, if the EC upholds the decision, would be 10  
percent of the turnover of the companies involved. 
</P>
<P>
	But EU Commission spokesman Stephan Rating said it was too early  
to discuss the amount of fines: ``This is only the start of the 
procedure. If we reach a final decision, fines are discretionary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FIA has an outstanding libel lawsuit against the European  
Commission in the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, claiming 
the EC has been leaking damaging allegations to reporters for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The FIA had no immediate response to Wednesday's developments,  
except to distribute a news release saying the issues had been 
before the Commission for up to five years.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Tries To Reschedule Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukraine is hoping to restructure $163  
million in overdue bond payments to a Dutch bank, a government 
official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine, struggling to raise money for other upcoming debt  
payments, missed a deadline June 9 for paying off a $155 million 
bond sold in August to ING Barings. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has told ING Barings it would pay 20 percent of  
the amount due and convert the rest to new three-year bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are continuing talks with our creditors and I think they  
will be successfully completed,'' Finance Minister Ihor Mitiukov 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the bank and government declined to comment further on the  
negotiations still in progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said ING Barings is reluctant to reschedule the debt,  
which it repackaged and sold to other investors, because it would 
have to persuade their investors to reschedule those debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine's economy has declined sharply since the former Soviet  
republic declared independence in 1991. The government has borrowed 
extensively in recent years to compensate for chronic shortfalls in 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine is scheduled to repay foreign lenders about $1 billion --  
a sum equal to its currency reserves -- by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The country faces a greater problem in 2000 owing more than $2.5  
billion. The Finance Ministry said recently it has not yet found 
that money.

<HEADLINE> Serial Killer Ng Sentenced to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A serial killer who videotaped victims  
begging for their lives was sentenced to death on Wednesday for a 
spree of sexual torture and murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Ng, a 38-year-old Hong Kong immigrant and former Marine,  
was convicted of murdering 11 people -- six men, three women and two 
baby boys. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng imprisoned, tortured and raped the women, who were lured to a  
cabin in the Sierra Nevada foothills, 150 miles east of San 
Francisco, that belonged to Leonard Lake, a friend of Ng's. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng denied killing anyone, but jurors watched videotapes in which  
Lake and Ng were seen tormenting bound women. In one of them, a 
woman pleads for her baby and Ng coldly replies that the baby is 
``sleeping like a rock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury that convicted Ng recommended he be put to death, and  
Superior Court Judge John J. Ryan agreed. Ryan could have sentenced 
Ng to life in prison without parole for the murders, which happened 
in 1984 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake killed himself after a shoplifting arrest in 1985. Ng was  
arrested later that year in Canada, where he fought extradition for 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	During the sentencing phase, Ng's parents flew in from Hong Kong  
and tearfully testified that he had been abused as a child. Several 
people also testified about Ng's good character, including former 
Marines, prison guards and a 66-year-old woman who was briefly Ng's 
lover.

<HEADLINE> Hubbell Scheduled To Plead Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In what could be one of the final chapters in  
Kenneth Starr's investigation, Webster Hubbell's planned guilty 
plea touches on two of the most sensitive areas of the prosecutor's 
inquiry: Hillary Rodham Clinton and payments to Hubbell from the 
president's friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell was scheduled to plead guilty to a felony and a  
misdemeanor today to U.S. District Judge James Robertson, according 
to legal sources familiar with Starr's nearly five-year 
investigation of the president and first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest charges against Hubbell stem from the never-explained  
emergence of Mrs. Clinton's law firm billing records in 1996, which 
revealed the legal work she and Hubbell did on a fraudulent 
Arkansas land deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell will plead guilty to concealing their work from federal  
bank examiners before Mrs. Clinton's billing records turned up 
inside the White House, two years after prosecutors subpoenaed 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell also will plead guilty to a misdemeanor tax charge to  
settle an indictment charging him with evading taxes on hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in income, some of it from the Clintons' 
friends in 1994 when Hubbell was under investigation by Starr's 
office. The plea is expected to dispose of the case, which had 
included Hubbell's wife, Suzy, his accountant and his tax lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The question now is whether Hubbell has anything further to add  
about the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	While Hubbell will now be subjected to questioning once again by  
Starr's office, the prosecutor may end up with little more from 
Hubbell than he had in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see anything Starr gets out of it except the wind-up  
of these proceedings and another notch in his belt,'' said George 
Washington University law professor Mary Cheh. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second time Starr and Hubbell have been down this road.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Starr allowed Hubbell to plead guilty to tax evasion  
and mail fraud in exchange for his full cooperation in the 
Whitewater investigation. Hubbell had stolen $400,000 from his law 
firm and its clients; he served 16 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Mrs. Clinton's billing records turned up and Starr  
discovered the payments from the president's friends, the 
prosecutor concluded Hubbell's cooperation had been ``incomplete'' 
and resumed the investigation of the former associate attorney 
general. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently released court records reveal that in his first round  
of cooperation with Starr's office in 1995, Hubbell gave the 
prosecutor damaging information about major figures in the 
Whitewater scandal, while providing little if anything useful to 
the prosecutor about his long-time friends Bill and Hillary 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell's information about Whitewater figures, including  
then-Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, was revealed in court papers 
filed by Starr's prosecutors in preparation for Hubbell's trial, 
which was scheduled Aug. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell was charged with concealing his and Mrs. Clinton's legal  
work on the 1,050-acre tract called Castle Grande, owned by her 
Whitewater business partner and Hubbell's father-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	The court papers -- a summary by Hubbell's legal team of his  
cooperation with Starr's office in 1995 -- proudly proclaim 
Hubbell's remarkable memory in supplying detailed information he 
recalled from years before regarding Tucker, a Tucker associate and 
other people who became criminal defendants in Starr's 
investigation. Still, Hubbell was not particularly close to these 
defendants personally. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 10-page memo to Starr seeking leniency, Hubbell lawyer  
John Nields devoted almost no space to the Clintons and Whitewater, 
telling Starr that ``Mr. Hubbell was not especially knowledgeable 
about this topic.''

<HEADLINE> Workers Protest at DKNY Offices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- About 50 garment workers and their supporters  
protested outside the Manhattan headquarters of designer Donna 
Karan on Wednesday, claiming that seamstresses were mistreated at a 
factory that was contracted to manufacture her dresses. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from Donna Karan International asserted that the  
designer's firm ``does not own or operate any factories. This is a 
personal dispute between a unionized contract manufacturer and some 
of its employees. We have absolutely nothing to do with their 
employment or working conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several women who said they had worked in the factory in the  
Garment Center told reporters the bathroom was locked to keep them 
from using it, they were not allowed to make or receive emergency 
phone calls, they were forced to keep their heads bent over their 
work, and they were not paid overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers also said they were subject to various racist rules.  
Hispanic women were allegedly restricted to sewing by hand because 
they were told they would break the machines, while Chinese women 
were allegedly restricted to using the machines after being told 
that their eyes weren't big enough to do good handwork. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we lifted our heads, they would shout at us. They never  
paid us overtime, even though we worked 60 hours a week,'' said 
Lupe Santos. ``We, the Latin workers, were especially discriminated 
against. They never let us touch the sewing machines. They said we 
would destroy them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The factory was contracted to produce dresses with the designer  
label. Protesters said it operated under the names Choe Ltd. 
Couture Enterprises Ltd. and Eastpoint International, but closed 
several months ago. It is not unusual for garment factory owners to 
close and reopen several days later under a different name or in a 
different location. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it too much to ask DKNY to show some social  
consciousness?'' asked Mabel Tso, a spokeswoman for National 
Mobilization Against Sweatshops, which organized the protest. 
``Donna Karan says, 'We don't know what goes on in our factories. 
It's not our fault.' Well, it is your responsibility. We are 
insisting the factory be reopened and these workers rehired.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Takes Time Out for Cubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- President Clinton came to Chicago to talk  
Medicare but wound up witnessing Sammy Sosa's 30th home run this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a speech Wednesday to pitch his new Medicare proposal  
to senior citizens, the president went to Wrigley Field to watch 
the Chicago Cubs-Milwaukee Brewers game. He was so excited about 
going to the game that he announced it at the start of his speech -- 
to the annoyance of the Secret Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton paused at a local hotel to change out of his business  
suit and keep tabs on the Northern Ireland peace talks. He spoke 
for about 10 minutes with British Prime Minister Tony Blair to get 
an update, then zipped over to Wrigley Field, where the score was 
4-3 Brewers in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	The president settled in the Cubs' owner's box, looking relaxed  
in a yellow, open-necked shirt and brown blazer. He waved to the 
fans. Some booed, others craned to catch a view of him. 
</P>
<P>
	In the seventh inning, Sosa slammed a ball over the left field  
wall for the game-winning home run. Clinton, clutching a half-eaten 
hot dog and a Cubs baseball cap in his left hand, stood and 
applauded. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs won 5-4. After the game, Cubs general manager Ed Lynch  
took Clinton to the clubhouse to congratulate Sosa. Lockhart said 
Clinton and Sosa hadn't seen each other since Sosa came to the 
White House in January for the State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Sosa chatted for 10 minutes in the locker room and  
for another 10 minutes alone in a nearby room. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa gave Clinton a blue Cubs jacket and a red Beanie Baby toy  
with a Cubs emblem on the package. The two exchanged autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He brings good luck,'' Sosa said of Clinton. ``A big guy like  
that comes to town to see the game -- it doesn't look too good if we 
lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton dropped his  
usual impartial stance on sports to root for Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was asked whether his wife, Hillary, would allow him to  
keep the jacket, given her newfound loyalty to the New York 
Yankees. Clinton nodded yes -- after a slow pause. He teasingly 
chastised a reporter who asked whether both Clintons were Cubs 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what she said. Don't play press games here,'' he  
said, smiling. ``This is about sports, not politics.''

<HEADLINE> Fla. License Law To Take Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Paul Frias went to the driver's license office at 3  
a.m. Wednesday -- and found 300 people already in line ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
	He was one of hundreds who flocked to Florida driver's licensing  
offices before a new law goes into effect Thursday that stiffens 
identification requirements, making it tougher for undocumented 
immigrants and teen-agers to get a driving permit. 
</P>
<P>
	``My passport is expired. My visa is expired,'' said Frias, 21.  
``If I don't get it today I'll have to go back to Mexico to get my 
passport again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Friday, some driver's license offices had been serving  
four to eight times the number of people they usually handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lines, depending on the size of the office, have been from 100  
(people) when we open at 7 a.m. to 600,'' said Janet Dennis, 
spokeswoman for the Department of Highway Safety and Motor 
Vehicles. ``We anticipated an increase, but we didn't quite 
anticipate this flood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The law brings Florida into compliance with other states. And  
because a driver's license is usually enough identification for a 
credit card or bank account, it should make it harder to open false 
accounts, Ms. Dennis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the old law, applicants could present almost any form of  
identification bearing their name. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Thursday, applicants who don't have a valid U.S. or  
Canadian driver's license must show one of five official documents: 
a U.S. birth certificate, a valid U.S. passport, an Immigration and 
Naturalization Service green card, an employment authorization 
card, or a Justice Department proof of non-immigrant 
classification. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, they must show a secondary piece of identification  
from a longer list of acceptable documents including baptism 
certificates, marriage certificates, Social Security cards or even 
family Bible records or birth announcements.

<HEADLINE> Norway, China Advance at World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Norway is heading to the Women's World  
Cup semifinals against China, a team they regard as the best in the 
world. The Norwegians look pretty sharp themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway beat Sweden 3-1 in a fierce quarterfinal match Wednesday  
night, and China defeated Russia 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway's coach, whose players won the World Cup title in 1995,  
said they're looking forward to the challenge of China, whose close 
score Wednesday against Russia didn't reflect the incredibly 
one-sided game. 
</P>
<P>
	``China is maybe, probably, no, absolutely the best team in the  
world right now. We're just one of the top four, so we want to see 
how we can do,'' Norwegian coach Per-Mathias Hogmo said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a much stronger attitude than Russia brought to its match  
against China. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our overall objective was not to win, but just to not concede  
too many goals,'' Russian coach Yurii Bystritzkii said. ``The 
Chinese are in a different class from us. It would have been 
senseless for us to open up the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Russia -- playing in its first World Cup -- played  
defense for almost the entire 90 minutes while China peppered 
Russian goalkeeper Svetlana Petko with 24 shots. The Russians, 
surprise quarterfinalists in their first World Cup, got off only 
two shots while spending most of the time chasing China's offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese midfielder Pu Wei was the first to score, kicking a  
slow, bouncing shot from outside the penalty box late in the first 
half. Petko, perhaps exhausted from about a dozen earlier saves, 
reacted late and watched the ball slide past the tips of her 
gloves. 
</P>
<P>
	The baby of the Chinese team at 18, Pu fell to her knees,  
thrilled with her first World Cup goal, before jumping up in glee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't the best shot I ever made, but I was obviously very  
excited because it was my first in the tournament,'' Pu said. 
</P>
<P>
	China scored again 10 minutes into the second half when Jin Yan  
knocked in the rebound of a shot that bounced off the post. 
</P>
<P>
	China's coach Ma Yuanan said they plan to win their next match.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to lose and go back to Beijing. We will fight  
until the last minute of this tournament,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway's coach said they are ready -- fit, acclimated and  
enjoying the American crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	During their game Wednesday, the Norwegians and Swedes,  
neighbors and frequent opponents in women's soccer, played a 
scoreless first half befitting a game between familiar rivals. 
Aarones' goal began Norwegian domination of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think my team was quite nervous in the second half and we  
didn't play so well after that goal,'' Swedish coach Marika 
Domanski Lyfors said. ``I don't think it was the heat, I think it 
was that Norway scored so early in the second half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Things quickly got worse for Karlsson and the rest of the  
Swedes. The Swedish goalie was stunned in the 55th minute after a 
collision that earned Norwegian substitute Solveig Gulbrandsen a 
yellow card. 
</P>
<P>
	Three minutes later, Norway's Marianne Pettersen faked two  
defenders and lofted a soft shot that floated over Karlsson and 
landed in the corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes after that, the Norwegians were awarded a penalty  
kick when Karlsson tripped Pettersen near the net. Hege Riise 
converted the penalty, making it 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't pleased with the first half. We played much better  
in the second half,'' Hogmo said. ``In the first half we gave the 
ball away too easily. Sweden had a lot of chances they shouldn't 
have had. The three second-half goals are indicative of how strong 
our team is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Swedes avoided a shutout when Malin Mostrom scored in injury  
time at the end of the second half. Although it gave the team 
little hope of winning, the goal did earn Sweden a spot in the next 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26,000-capacity Spartan Stadium had a crowd of 21,411.

<HEADLINE> Purdue Put on NCAA Probation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The NCAA on Wednesday slapped Purdue with a two-year probation  
for major rules violations in the men's basketball program and 
recommended the university be forced to pay more than $380,000 in 
penalties, sanctions school officials decried as excessive and 
baseless. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers were spared bans from postseason tournaments or  
restrictions on television appearances, and head coach Gene Keady 
was not cited. But athletic director Morgan Burke said the school 
would appeal the decision within an NCAA-imposed 15-day deadline, 
saying the evidence does not support such a harsh discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	``The penalties in some cases seem inappropriate and in other  
cases excessive,'' he said. ``I'm shocked, to be honest with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Committee on Infractions cut a scholarship from the men's  
basketball team, limited recruiting visits to the school and 
recommended the NCAA force Purdue to pay back most of the proceeds 
from appearances in the NCAA tournament, a penalty of more than 
$380,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA Committee on Infractions ruled the university violated  
rules regarding recruiting, extra benefits and ethical conduct. 
There were also several secondary violations by the NCAA champion 
women's basketball team, though none was considered serious and no 
sanctions were leveled against the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the sanctions involved assistant coach Frank Kendrick,  
who met with then-recruit Jamaal Davis in the summer of 1996 during 
a period when coaches are barred from contact with recruits and 
allegedly helped secure a loan for former player Luther Clay. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendrick later admitted telling Davis to lie about their contact  
to NCAA investigators, and Purdue fined him an undisclosed sum and 
forbade him to recruit off campus for 10 days during the official 
recruiting period that began in November 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But school officials maintain he did not improperly secure the  
$4,000 loan, which the NCAA found was never repaid, minimal effort 
was made to collect the balance and eventually was charged off by 
the bank after Clay transferred to Rhode Island following the 
1995-96 academic year, the NCAA ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke said the university disputes the NCAA's finding that the  
loan was improperly obtained, insisted that the bank assured Purdue 
the loan was handled like any normal transaction and said the bank 
was pursuing repayment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence produced on this issue doesn't seem to be of a  
kind on which a reasonable, prudent person would rely in the 
conduct of serious affairs,'' he said. ``There appears to be 
contradictions in the record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA banned Kendrick, who is still on Keady's staff, from  
off-campus recruiting for a year, and the Boilermakers will lose a 
scholarship for the 2000-01 and 2000-02 academic years, limiting 
the men's basketball team to 12 scholarships for those seasons. The 
university will be limited to four paid recruiting campus visits 
during the 1999-2000 and 2000-01 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also found that a booster violated NCAA rules by  
making arrangements for former Purdue guard Porter Roberts' mother 
to move to Indianapolis and providing her with transportation to 
home games. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke disputed the NCAA's assertion that the man had any ties to  
the university. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the loan provided for Clay, the committee recommended  
the NCAA force the school to repay up to 90 percent of the revenues 
generated from the Boilermakers' appearances in the 1996 and 
subsequent men's NCAA tournaments. David Swank, an Oklahoma law 
professor who chairs the Committee on Infractions, said it was also 
recommended that Purdue collect only 10 percent of revenues from 
possible tournament appearances the next three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you recommend that the (NCAA) Championship Cabinet  
take $380,000 from an institution, that's a severe penalty, and 
particularly the fact that there will be a similar sum in the next 
three years,'' Swank said. ``That is an extremely severe penalty in 
this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swank said a decision on that matter most likely would be  
delayed until next year if Purdue appeals the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	All team and individual records from the 24 games during the  
1995-96 season in which Clay participated will be vacated, 
including Purdue's NCAA tournament appearance that season in which 
the Boilermakers were a No. 1 seed but lost in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	Big Ten assistant commissioner Lisa Ryan said a conference  
committee will consider the NCAA sanctions and make any decisions 
on whether to strip the 1996 team of its conference crown, 
something that hasn't happened in recent memory.

<HEADLINE>  Time for a 'Wimbledome'? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- The first week of dry, warm weather at  
Wimbledon proved too good to be true. The curse of Wimbledon 
weather struck back with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
	All but five matches were rained out Monday. And not a  
competitive ball was struck Tuesday as the entire day's play was 
washed out. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 30th complete washout in Wimbledon history, and the  
first since 1997, when two straight days were wiped out by rain. 
</P>
<P>
	All of which begs the question: Why not have a Wimbledome?  
</P>
<P>
	Paul McNamee, director of the Australian Open, says it's high  
time the All England Club put up a stadium roof. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian Open has a sliding roof on its center court  
stadium and is building another on its main show court. 
</P>
<P>
	While Wimbledon wants to protect its tradition, McNamee said,  
the club should also consider the needs of fans, players and 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	``The easiest solution would have been to build Court 1 with a  
roof,'' he said. ``That would have guaranteed play would have gone 
on at all times and you wouldn't have changed Centre Court at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon had a chance to add a retractable roof when the new  
Court 1 was opened in 1997. But the attitude has been, it's an 
outdoor tournament and it will stay that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Interestingly, the public here will still sit in the rain and  
have a good time,'' McNamee said. ``But it could be better than 
that. In Australia we could not get away with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wimbledon is still able to get away with it, but I doubt if  
that can happen forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released Tuesday, the All England Club reiterated  
its reasons for not having a stadium roof: 
</P>
<P>
	-- the players prefer to play outdoors.  
</P>
<P>
	-- a covered court would not stand up to two week's play.  
</P>
<P>
	-- a roof on only one court would not significantly alleviate a  
backlog of matches and would be unfair to those players who were 
unable to play on the other 17 courts. 
</P>
<P>
	-- only a fraction of spectators would benefit.  
</P>
<P>
	-- a roof would damage ``the very essence'' of the tournament.  
</P>
<P>
	``Rain is tedious for everyone, and we understand and share the  
frustrations of fans during a rain delay,'' club chief executive 
Christopher Gorringe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Putting roofs on Centre or No. 1 Court ... merely creates  
difficulties in other areas ... deciding which matches should be 
played indoors and whether those players who play indoors receive 
an unfair advantage over those who do not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans come to Wimbledon because they still want to see the  
world's finest tennis players in action outdoors, on grass and 
across all 18 courts,'' he said. `We continue to believe that 
should remain so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers hoped to get all of the 11 remaining fourth-round  
matches completed today. 
</P>
<P>
	Steffi Graf was due up first on Court 1, only two games away  
from victory against Belgian qualifier Kim Clijsters. Graf was 
leading 6-2, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf and Clijsters warmed up for a few minutes Tuesday before  
showers sent them scurrying back to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Henman and Jim Courier spent less than a minute on Centre  
Court before the drizzle forced them back indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	With Henman leading two sets to one, the match was scheduled to  
resume today after the serve-and-volley duel between Boris Becker 
and Patrick Rafter. 
</P>
<P>
	Other featured matches include Venus Williams vs. Anna  
Kournikova, Pete Sampras vs. Daniel Nestor, Greg Rusedski vs. Mark 
Philippoussis and Todd Martin vs. Goran Ivanisevic.

time the All England Club put up a stadium roof. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian Open has a sliding roof on its center court  
stadium and is building another on its main show court. 
</P>
<P>
	While Wimbledon wants to protect its tradition, McNamee said,  
the club should also consider the needs of fans, players and 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	``The easiest solution would have been to build Court 1 with a  
roof,'' he said. ``That would have guaranteed play would have gone 
on at all times and you wouldn't have changed Centre Court at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon had a chance to add a retractable roof when the new  
Court 1 was opened in 1997. But the attitude has been, it's an 
outdoor tournament and it will stay that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Interestingly, the public here will still sit in the rain and  
have a good time,'' McNamee said. ``But it could be better than 
that. In Australia we could not get away with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wimbledon is still able to get away with it, but I doubt if  
that can happen forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released Tuesday, the All England Club reiterated  
its reasons for not having a stadium roof: 
</P>
<P>
	-- the players prefer to play outdoors.  
</P>
<P>
	-- a covered court would not stand up to two week's play.  
</P>
<P>
	-- a roof on only one court would not significantly alleviate a  
backlog of matches and would be unfair to those players who were 
unable to play on the other 17 courts. 
</P>
<P>
	-- only a fraction of spectators would benefit.  
</P>
<P>
	-- a roof would damage ``the very essence'' of the tournament.  
</P>
<P>
	``Rain is tedious for everyone, and we understand and share the  
frustrations of fans during a rain delay,'' club chief executive 
Christopher Gorringe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Putting roofs on Centre or No. 1 Court ... merely creates  
difficulties in other areas ... deciding which matches should be 
played indoors and whether those players who play indoors receive 
an unfair advantage over those who do not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans come to Wimbledon because they still want to see the  
world's finest tennis players in action outdoors, on grass and 
across all 18 courts,'' he said. `We continue to believe that 
should remain so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers hoped to get all of the 11 remaining fourth-round  
matches completed today. 
</P>
<P>
	Steffi Graf was due up first on Court 1, only two games away  
from victory against Belgian qualifier Kim Clijsters. Graf was 
leading 6-2, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf and Clijsters warmed up for a few minutes Tuesday before  
showers sent them scurrying back to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Henman and Jim Courier spent less than a minute on Centre  
Court before the drizzle forced them back indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	With Henman leading two sets to one, the match was scheduled to  
resume today after the serve-and-volley duel between Boris Becker 
and Patrick Rafter. 
</P>
<P>
	Other featured matches include Venus Williams vs. Anna  
Kournikova, Pete Sampras vs. Daniel Nestor, Greg Rusedski vs. Mark 
Philippoussis and Todd Martin vs. Goran Ivanisevic.

<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Pilots and flight attendants for Italian carrier  
Alitalia have threatened a four-hour strike on July 5, but 
officials said Wednesday they were optimistic about a negotiated 
end to the contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	The unions and airline are currently in talks aimed at heading  
off the midday strike, which would affect all Alitalia flights 
originating in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations are expected to go down to the wire, but  
airline and airport officials said they were hopeful that the job 
action can be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Eva Meldolesi, a spokeswoman for Aeroporti di Roma, said  
both sides appear ready to avoid disrupting the busy summer travel 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	A complex contract dispute is behind the planned strike, which  
would kick off a week of walkouts affecting rail and sea travel in

<HEADLINE> Eight Hurt in Brawl at Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Eight people were stabbed at a concert by rhythm  
and blues singer R. Kelly after a fight broke out near a concession 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
	The injured, all men ranging in age from 18 to 29, were taken  
Tuesday night to Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami police said. 
</P>
<P>
	One victim was seriously injured, some were listed in stable  
condition, and others were treated and released, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police didn't know what caused the disturbance. One arena  
concessionaire said the fight started when one man became jealous 
after another man spoke to his date. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how the two-inch blade knife got into Miami  
Arena. Security guards were equipped with metal detectors and 
ordered to check everyone at the door for weapons, said Melissa 
Fronstin, director of sales and marketing for the Miami Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The brawl grew to more than 50 people before quickly being  
contained. The concert went on as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Kelly's biggest hits is ``I Believe I Can Fly,'' for  
which he won three Grammys in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Hubbell Pleads Guilty in Starr Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Longtime presidential friend Webster Hubbell  
pleaded guilty today to a felony for concealing his and first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton's legal work on a fraudulent land deal back 
in Arkansas. Prosecutors recommended no jail time or fine. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a deal with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr,  
prosecutors asked that Hubbell serve one year of probation. U.S. 
District Judge James Robertson will decide the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell also pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in a tax evasion  
case that revolved around payments he received from friends of the 
president in 1994 and 1995, while he was under investigation by 
Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked in court whether he would change his plea from innocent on  
failure to disclose facts to investigators, a somber-looking 
Hubbell answered, ``I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He answered the tax charge with one word -- ``Guilty'' -- as his  
wife, Suzy, watched from the front row. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea ending nearly five years of investigation of Hubbell,  
who was formerly the No. 3 official in the Justice Department, and 
halted plans for a trial that could have been embarrassing for Mrs. 
Clinton as she explores whether to run for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr sat at the prosecution table as Hubbell, who already has  
served 18 months in prison for an earlier guilty plea, entered his 
pleas in the two separate criminal cases brought last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, Hubbell was accused of covering up his and Mrs.  
Clinton's legal work on a 1,050-acre land development south of 
Little Rock owned by Mrs. Clinton's Whitewater partner, Jim 
McDougal, and Hubbell's father-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	The land deal -- which federal regulators said was riddled with  
sham transactions -- cost the failing savings and loan owned by the 
Clintons' Whitewater partner $3.8 million and contributed to the 
insolvency of the institution. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax indictment, Hubbell was accused of failing to declare  
as income $74,000 of more than $450,000 in fees from 15 employers 
in 1994, when top Clinton advisers arranged consulting contracts 
for the former associate attorney general from Vernon Jordan and 
other close friends of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment said Hubbell paid only $30,000 in taxes for  
1989-92 and 1994-95, even though he earned more than $1 million 
from 1994 to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment said that by the end of 1997, Hubbell and his  
wife had liquidated about $1 million in assets and spent virtually 
all their money.

<HEADLINE> Medicare HMOs Changing Coverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- HMOs used to race to provide coverge to senior  
citizens as a way to increase market share and build profits. 
</P>
<P>
	But the elderly are no longer as attractive to health  
mainteinance organizations. The reason? HMOs say government 
payments no longer keep up with the rising cost of caring for 
medicare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, about 200,000 Medicare HMO recipients will be  
forced to change health plans next year and millions of additional 
seniors will face higher rates for fewer benefits as HMOs complain 
that government reimbursements no longer are keeping up with their 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	PacifiCare Health Systems, Humana and Foundation Health Systems  
-- three of the nation's biggest Medicare health maintenance 
organizations -- said Wednesday they will stop covering Medicare 
members in several markets. 
</P>
<P>
	CIGNA and several regional HMOs previously said they will  
withdraw from a number of Medicare markets on Jan. 1, 2000, while 
Aetna and United Healthcare are expected to join the trend on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the HMOs said they expect to raise premiums and  
reduce some benefits on many of their remaining members as a way to 
make staying in the program financially viable. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the HMOs complain the government is cutting back,  
Medicare officials say payments continue to grow, but at a slower 
rate in some markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Studies continue to show that Medicare managed care plans are  
still being overpaid,'' said Nancy Ann DeParle, administrator of 
the Health Care Financing Administration which oversees Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The health plans were required to notify the federal government  
by Thursday of any changes to their Medicare HMO operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems virtually every Medicare (HMO) beneficiary will be  
affected by some type of cutback,'' said Karen Ignagni, president 
of the American Association of Health Plans, an HMO trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare HMO members will receive notices in the next several  
days if their plan is withdrawing from Medicare, and they will 
either have to choose another health plan -- if one is available -- 
or choose traditional Medicare. Members will be notified of precise 
benefit changes and premium increases in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Humana, for example, said some of its members will no longer get  
coverage for any prescription drugs other than generics. Some 
Humana members also will have to pay part of the cost of outpatient 
hospital care. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6.2 million of the 39 million Medicare enrollees now get  
health insurance coverage through an HMO. Seniors have signed up 
with HMOs as an alternative to Medicare's traditional 
fee-for-service coverage because the HMOs offer them prescription 
drug coverage and fewer co-payments. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton on Tuesday unveiled his plan to offer a  
prescription drug program for traditional Medicare, though 
Republican opposition is likely to hurt its chances for passage. 
</P>
<P>
	In many retirement areas such as South Florida and Arizona,  
federal reimbursement for HMOs had been so high the plans did not 
charge seniors a premium. 
</P>
<P>
	But HMO officials say that's about to change.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, about 400,000 Medicare recipients in more than 30  
states had to change health plans when more than 100 HMOs opted 
against renewing Medicare contracts after the federal government 
cut the growth in the reimbursement rate. Until then, Medicare had 
been seen as the most lucrative market for HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Medicare payment changes, part of the 1997 balanced-budget  
law, were made in response to reports that Medicare was overpaying 
the health plans. 
</P>
<P>
	While fewer Medicare recipients will have to change health plans  
in 2000 compared to 1999, industry officials say the situation is 
worse because so many Medicare HMO members will face higher 
premiums, Ignagni said. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles-based Foundation, one of California's biggest health  
insurers, said it will drop about 5 percent of its 283,000 Medicare 
enrollees in 2000. The company said it's planning to drop Medicare 
coverage in parts of several states where it operates. It refused 
to disclose specific details. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Hartford-based CIGNA said it would drop coverage of  
about 10,000 Medicare beneficiaries next year or about 5 percent of 
its Medicare members. CIGNA is leaving six markets: Little Rock, 
Ark., Cleveland, Kansas City, Kan., Philadelphia and southern New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisville, Ky.-based Humana said Wednesday it will withdraw its  
Medicare HMO from the following markets: Tucson, Ariz., Las Vegas, 
Dallas, Kansas City, Kan., Austin, Texas, Milwaukee, Wis. and 
Melbourne, Fla. Humana also plans to exit parts of the San Antonio 
and Houston markets. As a result, about 46,000 of Humana's 480,000 
Medicare HMO members will be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	``When government reimbursement of care for seniors in Medicare  
Choice plans is no longer adequate to cover the cost of quality 
care, we have no choice but to discontinue the product,'' said 
Gregory H. Wolf, Humana's president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Santa Ana, Calif.-based PacifiCare said Wednesday it is pulling  
its Medicare plan out of several markets including: Dayton, Ohio, 
Medford, Ore., McMinnville Ore., Spokane, Wash. and central 
California. The move will affect 16,400 of its 991,000 Medicare HMO 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Arizona said it plans to quit  
covering Medicare members in that state, forcing 13,000 of its 
members to find another insurance option.

<HEADLINE> Powerball Jackpot Hits $145 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Players from coast to coast plunked  
their dollars down today for a chance at a Powerball jackpot worth 
$145 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge boom for business when the lottery gets this  
high,'' said John Holda, assistant manager of Pill-And-Puff 
convenience store in downtown Milwaukee. He said one customer 
bought 275 tickets Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Moody, who works a Dahl's Foods supermarket in Des  
Moines, said this morning that a dozen or more people were lined 
up. The store is a favorite stop for ticket buyers who work 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst thing is, I don't want to get stuck down on that  
(lottery) machine,'' Moody joked. ``But we're bringing in an extra 
person to help out because eventually, we will all get stuck on 
that machine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If there's a winner, Powerball officials say, it would be the  
third largest Powerball jackpot ever won. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest win was $295.7 million on July 29, 1998. The winning  
ticket was sold at a gas station in Richmond, Indiana, and was 
bought by 13 machinists who worked together in Westerville, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut Gov. John G. Rowland signed a bill Tuesday that  
would allow the state to suspend Powerball sales in some border 
towns if lines get too long. 
</P>
<P>
	Large Powerball jackpots last year drew thousands of would-be  
millionaires from New York and other states where the game is not 
played into Connecticut. Lines in some towns grew to eight hours 
long. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law allows towns to ask the lottery to suspend Powerball  
sales in that location for 24 hours if a huge influx of players 
threatens public health and safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Players in the multi-state lotto game select five numbers from a  
field of one to 49 and a single Powerball from among the numbers 
one to 42. The jackpot is won by matching all five numbers, plus 
the Powerball. 
</P>
<P>
	Players matching five numbers without the Powerball win  
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The game, headquartered in Iowa, is played in Arizona,  
Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Indiana, Idaho, 
Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, 
Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South 
Dakota, Wisconsin and West Virginia.

<HEADLINE> INS' Role in Railroad Case Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department's top watchdog will  
investigate why the Immigration and Naturalization Service detained 
and then released a Mexican national wanted for questioning in 
connection with several murders. 
</P>
<P>
	INS Commissioner Doris Meissner said Wednesday that her agency's  
failure to identify Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, a 39-year-old drifter 
charged in two murders and linked to six other slayings, ``has 
raised serious questions about the INS' knowledge of the case and 
procedures used in encounters with'' him. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result of these questions, I have referred the matter to  
the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General,'' 
Meissner said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS arrested Resendez-Ramirez in the El Paso area during the  
week of June 1 for being in this country illegally and deported him 
to Mexico later that day, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after his June 2 release, authorities believe he killed  
a 73-year-old woman west of Houston. The following day, they 
believe he killed a 26-year-old Houston schoolteacher at her home. 
His fingerprints then were found June 15 in Gorham, Ill., at the 
scene of the murder of an 80-year-old man and his 52-year-old 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI continues to call the suspect Rafael Resendez-Ramirez,  
one of many aliases he uses, but says his real name is Angel 
Leoncio Reyes Recendis, according to a birth certificate. The 
39-year-old was born in Izucar de Matamoros, Puebla, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	INS officials said that when Resendez-Ramirez was in the custody  
of the Border Patrol on June 1, they didn't have any information on 
his criminal records or any outstanding warrants. 
</P>
<P>
	But Meissner said the INS had multiple entries on  
Resendez-Ramirez in a photo and fingerprint database that provides 
immediate identification of aliens apprehended by Border Patrol. 
The system became widely available in 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	INS first encountered Resendez-Ramirez in 1976 after he was  
arrested in Michigan. He was returned to Mexico, but since that 
time had been deported from the U.S. on three occasions -- in 1985, 
1987 and 1991. He was also apprehended by Border Patrol agents 
eight times between January 1998 and the present. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissner said the Justice Department will look at why  
Resendez-Ramirez ``was not detained and whether INS knew about 
Resendez-Ramirez criminal activities after being contacted by local 
law enforcement earlier this year.''

<HEADLINE> Genetic Cervical Cancer Link Seen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A study of Swedish women offers some of the best statistical  
evidence yet that heredity plays a role in cervical cancer, a 
disease that is blamed mostly on infection by a sexually 
transmitted virus. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers looked at extraordinarily detailed public health  
records on mothers and daughters to reach their conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	They did not estimate what percentage of cervical cancer cases  
might be attributable to heredity. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was led by Ulf Gyllensten, a geneticist at the  
University of Uppsala in Sweden. It was published in Thursday's 
issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists know that the sexually transmitted human papilloma  
virus can lead, in a small fraction of cases, to cancer of the 
cervix. But they have long suspected that genetics plays a role in 
at least some cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swedish study, based solely on statistics, is considered  
exceptional because of the detail provided by Swedish records, and 
the highly stable and homogeneous population in the Scandinavian 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``This certainly gives us more of a reason to believe it's  
related to genetics,'' said Dr. Wendy Brewster, an epidemiology 
expert at the University of California at Irvine. ``For so long 
with cervical cancer it's been argued that it's environmental, or a 
sexually transmitted cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gyllensten compared the Swedish cancer registry, which contains  
records of all cancer diagnosed in Sweden between 1958 and 1993, 
against the Swedish national registry of parents of people born 
after 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked at nearly 127,000 relatives of 71,533 women  
with cervical cancer. It tracked mothers and daughters in the same 
families, and distinguished between biological and adoptive 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The results showed a strong link in the risk of cervical cancer  
between women related biologically. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study doesn't tell us what gene it's on, or whether it's  
multiple genes, but it's very exciting,'' Brewster said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also indicated that women are at risk for cervical  
cancer at a younger age if they had a mother or sister with the 
disease. That typically is true of most types of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The human papilloma virus is the nation's most common sexually  
transmitted disease, infecting up to half the women in the United 
States with between 100 and 200 different strains, said Denise 
Galloway of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	But only a tiny percentage of women get one of the few dangerous  
strains that cause cervical cancer. The disease affects about 
16,000 American women a year, and about 5,000 die.

<HEADLINE> SBC-Ameritech Merger Plan Gets OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- SBC Communications and Ameritech Corp. inched  
closer to merging into the nation's largest local phone company 
with tentative approval from federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Staff members to the Federal Communications Commission said they  
would recommend approval based on a set of conditions the companies 
proposed to the government, said Robert Atkinson, deputy chief of 
the commission's Common Carrier Bureau. A formal written proposal 
has yet to be submitted. 
</P>
<P>
	``But based on extraordinarily lengthy discussions and meetings  
(with the two companies), if there are no surprises in this 
document when we get it, and I don't expect any, then I can fully 
support the package,'' Atkinson said Tuesday. ``My recommendation 
to the commission would be that they approve the merger with those 
conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed guidelines, SBC-Ameritech would enter 30 new  
markets within 30 months to compete with established local phone 
companies. The new regions tapped would be markets where it would 
face competition from companies including Bell Atlantic, Bell South 
and US West. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to meet the deadline could mean facing up to $1.2  
billion in penalties, or $40 million per market. Fines of up to an 
additional $1 billion could be added if SBC-Ameritech fails to meet 
performance standards in the new areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed conditions are intended to ease misgivings of the  
FCC, which wants to ensure healthy competition in local markets. 
Once the commission receives a formal report, the conditions will 
be open for public comment and, ultimately, a vote by the full 
commission. Atkinson said he does not know how soon that will be. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman William Kennard said in a statement that he is  
``encouraged by SBC and Ameritech's commitment to open their 
markets to competition and their agreement to suffer stiff 
penalties if they do not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Atkinson expressed confidence the new company will meet all  
conditions.

<HEADLINE> Internet Defamation Suit Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- A judge has dismissed a defamation  
lawsuit filed against an America Online user by a judge in 
Pennsylvania, in a case the American Civil Liberties Union said had 
important free speech implications. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pennsylvania jurist, Allegheny County Superior Court Judge  
Joan Orie-Melvin, sought $50,000 in damages from an AOL user, whose 
identity she did not know, over a statement on a Web site 
expressing dismay that Ms. Orie-Melvin had allegedly lobbied on 
behalf of a lawyer seeking a judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
	She filed the suit in Loudoun County because AOL is based there.  
AOL was not a party to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Loudoun County Circuit Judge Thomas Horne ruled that just  
because AOL is based here does not mean Virginia courts are open to 
lawsuits involving worldwide Internet communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a small case in many ways but the principle is very  
important,'' said Kent Willis, executive director of the ACLU's 
Virginia chapter. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Ms. Orie-Melvin nor her lawyer, Bob Beagan, immediately  
returned telephone messages left today seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Becker Bids Wimbledon Adieu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- No more tumbling shots. No more German  
shouts of anguish. No more Boom Boom. 
</P>
<P>
	Boris Becker gave Wimbledon a final wave Wednesday, acknowledged  
his last standing ovation and disappeared for good. 
</P>
<P>
	A part-time player since he announced his retirement from Grand  
Slams two years ago, Becker won three rounds of Wimbledon, but 
finally lost 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 on Centre Court to second-seeded Patrick 
Rafter. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning three titles, the first as the youngest men's winner at  
age 17, and reaching four other singles finals, Becker said Centre 
Court felt like his living room. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's moved out completely.  
</P>
<P>
	Are you sure, Boris?  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh yes, definitely,'' the 31-year-old German replied. ``Last  
time, I said 99 percent. Now I say 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Returning for a 15th shot at the title after missing last year's  
tournament, Becker gave glimpses of his old form in the previous 
three rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	He rallied from two sets and three match points down against  
Britain's Miles Maclagan to win in five. Then he dished out a 
grass-court lesson to fellow German and No. 15 seed Nicholas 
Kiefer, a youngster who riled Becker by dropping out of his 
training school. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker handed another three-set defeat to another rising star,  
Australia's Lleyton Hewitt. But Rafter proved too strong. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an incredible ride. I've won more matches here than  
anybody,'' said Becker whose titles came in 1985, '86 and '89. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great love affair. It was like nowhere else in the  
world. The place was always very special to me. It made me who I am 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe the way I have been playing the last 10  
days here,'' Becker said. ``I didn't expect at all to be in the 
round of 16 playing Pat Rafter. But he outplayed me. He was a class 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I left my serve at home,'' he said. ``I had no timing on my  
serve at all. Every time I served, it was a struggle. It was very 
unfortunate I was not able to give him and the crowd a better match 
for my last match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Becker walked off court, he dropped his bag, stopped and  
turned to wave to all corners of the arena. All the fans, Royal Box 
included, were on their feet. Becker stopped to sign some 
autographs and shook hands with tournament referee Alan Mills 
before he disappeared through the doorway into Wimbledon history. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker remains as Germany's Davis Cup manager while his wife,  
former actress Barbara Feltus, is seven months pregnant and about 
to give birth to his second son. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thankful I had a chance to come back and play decent  
tennis,'' Becker said. ``Now it's time to do something else.''

<HEADLINE> Cuban Swimmers Can Stay in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- After public protests, six Cubans who  
jumped out of a boat just off shore, then fought to evade Coast 
Guardsmen trying to keep them from reaching land, will be allowed 
to stay in this country to apply for asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	Under U.S. policy, Cubans who reach shore are allowed to stay  
and eventually get work permits, but those found at sea -- even a 
few yards offshore -- are usually returned to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the Cubans made it to shore Tuesday afternoon as a crowd  
in Surfside cheered them on. But one was surrounded by police and 
handcuffed, and Coast Guardsmen nabbed the others in a struggle 
that was broadcast on local television. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people protested, accusing the Coast Guard of  
brutality and insensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Demonstrators temporarily shut down a major highway, and the  
police chief of Hialeah was treated for minor injuries after 
clashing with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Public officials joined in protesting the Coast Guard's action.  
</P>
<P>
	One official, Hialeah Mayor Raul Martinez, took a direct role as  
one demonstration continued early today. When a protester refused 
police orders to move on, TV cameras caught Martinez grabbing the 
man and pummeling him on the back. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez said the demonstrators ``didn't care about those six  
individuals. They were here just to make trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Late Tuesday, Coast Guard officials said the six refugees will  
be allowed to stay in the United States. After being checked for 
criminal records, all were expected to be released while they apply 
for asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees jumped from a 14-foot rowboat about 150 yards off  
shore, then swam and frantically changed directions each time 
authorities drew near in one of four boats. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Coast Guard officers used water hoses on those in  
the rowboat, and one refugee in the water was hit with pepper 
spray. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters later gathered outside the Coast Guard station in  
Miami Beach, waving Cuban flags and yelling ``You almost killed 
them'' and ``Free them.'' An estimated 1,000 protesters shut down a 
causeway to Miami Beach in the midst of rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas said his staff was in contact with  
Washington officials all day long protesting the action. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very dark day not just for Miami, but for the  
country,'' said Miami Mayor Joe Carollo. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no room in this great nation for a policy of such  
savage and brutal treatment of refugees whose only crime is the 
pursuit of freedom,'' Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., wrote to 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard Commandant James Loy promised ``a full, serious and  
prompt investigation'' of the agency's actions, Diaz-Balart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very upset that the Cuban community feels we acted  
inappropriately,'' said a Coast Guard spokesman, Lt. Ron LaBrec. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy on stopping Cubans off shore has aggravated tensions  
in recent weeks with Cuban boats arriving at least weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard has picked up 826 Cubans so far this year,  
compared with 1,047 in all of last year.

<HEADLINE> China Wants To Improve US Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Even though he is resigning with U.S.-China  
relations in a slump, U.S. Ambassador James Sasser said today that 
Chinese leaders have indicated to him that they want to repair ties 
hurt by NATO's accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 
Yugoslavia, 
</P>
<P>
	Despite China's angry public denunciations since the attack  
nearly eight weeks ago, Sasser said he dined with President Jiang 
Zemin on Sunday, lunched Monday with Defense Minister Chi Haotian 
and had long talks with Premier Zhu Rongji at dinner Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese leaders used the unusually high-level send-off ``to  
send a signal quietly that, when they can, they want to get this 
relationship back on track,'' Sasser, who leaves his post on 
Thursday, told Associated Press Television News. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sasser also suggested that Jiang and Zhu -- both regarded as  
advocates of closer ties with Washington -- do not have a free hand. 
NATO's bombing caused ``deep-seated anger'' that other Chinese 
politicians want to use to diminish their power. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leadership is feeling its way,'' he said. American-leaning  
leaders ``have been embarrassed, frankly, by the embassy bombing 
and this is being used against them by their political opponents,'' 
Sasser said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So it's going to take some time for the dust to settle and  
things to resolve themselves,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombing killed three Chinese journalists and plunged ties to  
their lowest ebb in decades. Protests, some violent, erupted in at 
least 20 Chinese cities. Sasser was trapped in his embassy for four 
days by tens of thousands of stone-throwing demonstrators baying 
for American blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Sasser said the protests marked the lowest point in his 3 1/2 years  
in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could hear the rocks crashing through the windows,'' he  
said. ``Every time the demonstrators would make a hit and break a 
window, a great cheer would go up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The high point he said was seeing Presidents Jiang and Clinton  
inspect a Chinese honor guard beside Beijing's Tiananmen Square at 
the start of their landmark summit last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bands were playing and I saw the American flag there in  
front of the Great Hall of The People,'' Sasser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sasser can take some credit for that moment -- the warmest in  
U.S.-China relations during Clinton's presidency. Sasser took up 
the ambassador's job in February 1996 at another crisis point: 
China's attempt to intimidate Taiwan with missile-firings that 
caused Washington to send warships near the island as a warning to 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike his predecessors, Sasser was not a career diplomat but a  
U.S. senator from Tennessee for 18 years. He used his contacts with 
fellow democrat Clinton to help engineer a rapprochement with China 
-- and Jiang reciprocated the overtures. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Clinton visit, allegations that Chinese spies stole  
U.S. nuclear secrets, tensions over human rights and the embassy 
bombing have soured the mood. 
</P>
<P>
	Sasser was optimistic, however, that contacts between the  
countries' militaries that China suspended in retaliation for the 
embassy bombing will be restored ``fairly fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His designated successor is a retired admiral, Joseph Prueher.  
Sasser said Prueher ``will be a catalyst in getting these 
military-to-military relationships and the understanding that 
follows from it back in place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sasser hinted that he may return to the American political  
milieu he knows so well. Along with writing and public speaking, he 
has had some discussions about joining the presidential campaign of 
Vice President Al Gore, a fellow Tennessean and friend.

<HEADLINE> Hawks Make Jones 27th Pick of Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The big round table with the good food and  
nice silverware backstage at the MCI Center was a nice place to 
wait. Jumaine Jones only wishes he could have left his seat sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones shed some tears when he became the last of the 16 invited  
players to be chosen Wednesday night in the NBA draft. The 6-foot-7 
forward, who left Georgia after his sophomore year, said he was 
starting to feel a little lonely before he was selected 27th by the 
Atlanta Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tears of joy. I'm just glad to be drafted,'' Jones said. ``I  
was the only guy back there. But it really motivates me because I 
feel I should've got drafted higher than I did. 
</P>
<P>
	``They definitely got a steal. All the teams that skipped over  
me, hey, they better look out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, just as he was feeling comfortable wearing the Hawks hat,  
Jones was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers for a future first-round 
draft pick. Loyalty doesn't last long sometimes on draft day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Definitely, Philadelphia got a steal,'' Jones said. ``I talked  
to coach (Larry) Brown. I thought it was a good situation for me in 
Atlanta, but I'm pretty happy to be in Philadelphia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was an honorable mention All-America as a sophomore,  
averaging 14.7 points and 8.5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	As the evening progressed, Jones watched as the other invitees  
heard their names called and made the walk to the podium. 
Eventually, only Jones and Tim James from Miami were left -- and 
then James was taken by the Miami Heat at No. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I'd be in the top 15, but like I was saying all the  
time, anything could happen,'' Jones said. ``It did.''

<HEADLINE> CNN Names 'Moneyline' Hosts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It took two people to replace Lou Dobbs on CNN's  
``Moneyline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cable news network moved quickly to fill a vacuum in its  
most profitable program on Tuesday, appointing Stuart Varney and 
Willow Bay as co-anchors of the nightly business wrap-up show. 
</P>
<P>
	In two weeks, they will replace Dobbs, who left unexpectedly  
earlier this month to join an Internet startup firm. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN is also set to unveil a $25 million advertising campaign in  
support of ``Moneyline'' and its other programs that features 
personalities like New York Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens and 
Virgin Airlines' founder Richard Branson. 
</P>
<P>
	Although its audience is small compared to broadcast network  
shows, CNN's ``Moneyline'' is among the most profitable programs on 
television because it attracts so many corporate executives and 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	After Dobbs left, the financial news network CNBC immediately  
sought to take advantage by expanding its ``Business Center'' 
program to an hour, competing directly with ``Moneyline.'' CNBC has 
also started its own aggressive marketing campaign touting anchors 
Ron Insana and Sue Herera. 
</P>
<P>
	While CNN wanted to make the right decision on who should  
replace Dobbs, it also wanted to move swiftly, said Steve Korn, 
vice chairman of the CNN News Group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you have a show that is as important to a network as  
`Moneyline' is to us, it's an important decision and one you 
shouldn't dither with,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Korn said CNN wanted to appoint an anchor team, instead of one  
person, to give the network flexibility to send them on 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	Varney, 50, worked at CNN for 18 years before leaving last year  
to go on the lecture circuit. He had been anchor of the network's 
early-morning financial news programming. 
</P>
<P>
	Bay, a former ABC News reporter, has been host of CNN financial  
and entertainment newsmagazines and has filled in for Dobbs since 
he left. 
</P>
<P>
	``My excitement meter has gone up a great deal,'' Varney said.  
``This is the premier financial news program on television today 
and it therefore represents a great opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He may have fewer opportunities for public speaking; a CNN  
ethics panel determines whether employees can take outside speaking 
engagements and will decide, case by case, whether Varney can make 
speeches, Korn said. 
</P>
<P>
	A CNBC spokesman had no comment on the move.  
</P>
<P>
	In its first week of head-to-head competition as hour-long  
shows, ``Moneyline'' had an average audience of 293,000 households 
and ``Business Center'' was at 238,000, according to Nielsen Media 
Research.

<HEADLINE> Convicted Killer Captured In Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- An escaped killer was recaptured after  
evading police for two days in a swampy woodland populated by 
alligators, wild pigs and poisonous snakes. 
</P>
<P>
	A rookie Texas corrections officer spotted a man in boxer shorts  
Tuesday and called for backup. Clifford Jones was nabbed a short 
time later, 49 hours after his escape. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just tense,'' said Timothy Ritch, a former oilfield  
machinist in his second month on the job as a corrections officer. 
``When he heard me holler for the sergeant, he ran up a tree. I 
shouted to my sergeant I had the inmate in sight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones surrendered without incident.  
</P>
<P>
	``He looked a little ragged,'' Lt. George McDonald said. ``He  
was muddy. It looked like he was ready to give up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was charged with escape and taken to a prison near Wichita  
Falls. Warden Rick Thaler said Jones' only noticeable injuries were 
scratches and numerous insect bites. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 33, was serving 26 years for murder, attempted murder and  
assault. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been the object of a manhunt since he fled Sunday from  
the Estelle Unit's high-security section for the state's most 
troublesome and violent convicts. He spent two days and two nights 
dodging some 300 law enforcement officers using tracking dogs, 
horses, boats and helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones broke out after slipping out of his handcuffs, climbing a  
fence and getting through an 8- to 10-inch gap high above a caged 
recreation area. He climbed a camera tower and jumped over another 
fence before sprinting into the woods. 
</P>
<P>
	He shed virtually all of his clothing shortly after fleeing,  
apparently hoping to evade tracking dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Estelle Unit shares state property with the Ellis Unit,  
where last Thanksgiving night seven condemned killers broke out of 
death row. Six were captured. The seventh inmate, Martin Gurule, 
was found dead a week later in a creek on the prison grounds. He 
had drowned.

<HEADLINE> Fed. Reserve Raises Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for  
the first time in two years on Wednesday, nudging borrowing costs 
higher for millions of American consumers and businesses. But the 
central bank indicated its tiny quarter-point increase may be all 
that is needed to keep inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
	That message cheered financial markets. Investors had feared the  
increase would be only the first in a series of moves to cool down 
the red-hot U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average roared to life after the Fed's  
midafternoon announcement, ending the day up 155.45 at 10,970.80. 
The bond market, which has been battered for weeks by fears of 
inflation and higher interest rates, also staged a strong rally 
with the yield on Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond falling to 5.99 
percent, down from 6.06 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At the conclusion of two days of closed-door discussions, Fed  
policy-makers said they were increasing the target for the federal 
funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, from 4.75 percent to 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That move was followed quickly by announcements from commercial  
banks that they were increasing their prime lending rate, the 
benchmark for millions of business and consumer loans, from 7.75 
percent to 8 percent. Bank of America led the way, announcing an 
increase to 8 percent effective on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed said in a statement that it felt the need to be  
``especially alert to the emergence, or potential emergence, of 
inflationary forces that could undermine economic growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But at the same time, the Fed indicated that it was moving its  
policy directive, which signals the future course of interest 
rates, back to neutral. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank had changed its directive at the last meeting  
on May 18 from neutral to one leaning toward raising rates, putting 
markets on notice. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists said it was significant that the Fed was now  
willing to return to a neutral stance after only a single rate 
hike. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message from the Fed is that they are not in any big hurry  
nor particularly worried that quick action is necessary on the 
inflation front,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Primark 
Global Economics in New York. ``The markets are relieved because 
the central bank could have been a lot tougher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts said they read in the central bank's statement a  
willingness to continue testing the view of many economists that 
the U.S. economy has entered a new era where higher productivity 
allows stronger growth and lower unemployment rates without 
triggering inflation worries. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few years ago most economists assumed that the economy could  
not grow much faster than 2 percent and unemployment could not get 
much lower than 6 percent without igniting inflation. Now we know 
that both of those assumptions are probably wrong,'' said Robert 
Reich, former labor secretary in the Clinton administration and now 
an economics professor at Brandeis University. He said he was 
``pleasantly surprised'' because he was afraid the Fed would adopt 
a tougher stance on the need to be pre-emptive about inflation 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. economy has been growing at close to a 4 percent rate  
for the past two years, far above the Fed's speed limit of around 
2.5 percent. The faster growth has pushed unemployment down to a 
three-decade low of 4.2 percent currently. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's statement acknowledged the debate over whether the  
U.S. economy has entered a new era. ``Labor markets have continued 
to tighten over recent quarters, but strengthening productivity 
growth has contained inflationary pressures,'' the Fed said, 
echoing comments Chairman Alan Greenspan has made in recent 
appearances that U.S. productivity, after lagging for two decades, 
has picked up recently. 
</P>
<P>
	When the economy is growing at a rate the Fed believes is too  
fast, it raises interest rates to slow spending on big-ticket items 
such as homes, autos and appliances. In that way, economic growth 
slows and inflation pressures remain in check. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some Fed critics said they were unhappy that the Fed felt  
the need to raise interest rates at all, given that inflation at 
the consumer level returned to a moderate level in May after a 
worrisome 0.7 percent surge in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``With no inflation visible in consumer prices or wages, it is  
unfortunate that as a result of today's action ... we may be 
hindering the economic advance of those who need it most,'' said 
Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarbanes noted that the current record peacetime expansion, now  
in its ninth year, had enabled inner-city groups and others at the 
``lower end of the economic ladder ... to obtain jobs, get 
promotions, receive training and enjoy wage increases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed increase marked the first in the funds rate since March  
1997. Last fall, the central bank cut the rate in three 
quarter-point moves out of concern that overseas turmoil from the 
Asian currency crisis could threaten the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since then much of the financial strain has eased, foreign  
economies have firmed and economic activity in the United States 
has moved forward at a brisk pace,'' the Fed said in its statement. 
``Accordingly, the full degree of adjustment (in last fall's rate 
cuts) is judged no longer necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Janet  
Yellen, head of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said 
the administration shared the central bank's goal of ``maintaining 
solid economic growth with low inflation. ... We believe that the 
economy will continue on a sound path, led by strong private-sector 
investment.''

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Country Fan Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- You must know where to draw the line.  
</P>
<P>
	For pregnant country star Victoria Shaw, that meant no belly  
rubs. For fellow musician Marty Stuart, it meant declaring his 
derriere off-limits to amateur photographers. 
</P>
<P>
	Such guidelines are vital at the International Country Music Fan  
Fair, a four-day festival where aficionados turn out for a peek -- 
or, if they're lucky, something more -- at country's biggest stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The orgy of concerts and autograph-gathering is an institution  
unique to country music. Imagine Mick Jagger spending four hours in 
a booth signing autographs, then singing a few songs for 
union-scale wages at the Tennessee State Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	You can't.  
</P>
<P>
	That's Fan Fair, where more than 20,000 folks turned out June  
14-16 to support their favorite stars and be won over by the 
up-and-coming. 
</P>
<P>
	The big names performed in showcases sponsored by their record  
labels, knocked out interviews in a Spartan media building, and -- 
most importantly -- pressed as much flesh as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Though criticized locally for the absence of some superstars,  
this year's Fan Fair featured more than 160 artists. There was no 
Garth Brooks, but the mild weather was perfect for chasing down 
your favorite star. 
</P>
<P>
	That group included Alan Jackson, Bryan White, Clint Black,  
Vince Gill and Patty Loveless. Each let their fans know they hadn't 
-- as the old country phrase goes -- gotten above their raising. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't thank you enough,'' shouted singer Lee Roy Parnell to  
the crowd at the Arista Records showcase. ``You're why we have 
jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Longshots like Jeff Paz, Randall ``Randy'' Franks and Carroll  
Baggett turned out, too, stumping for support. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get to meet people who haven't made it yet,'' said Becky  
Ashby, a Washington, D.C., secretary. ``One year we got Shania 
Twain's autograph and there was hardly anyone there. We came back 
the next year and she was a star.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Propped up with her friend, Debbie Hughes, against a white  
cinderblock wall, Ashby said singer Billy Ray Cyrus inspired her 
first trip to Fan Fair. This year marked her fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Between them, Hughes and Ashby are members of six fan clubs,  
including those of Cyrus, David Kersh and Alan Jackson. Like most 
fans at the event, they were dressed for comfort in shorts and 
T-shirts, cameras ever ready for star sightings. They munched on 
hot dogs, hamburgers and barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes and Ashby planned to enlist in the fan club of the  
generally unknown Paz. Both agreed that he outdid established star 
Ricky Van Shelton that day. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in his booth all the time, and he's really nice,'' Ashby  
said of Paz. ``We waited for Ricky Van Shelton for an hour and a 
half. He was late, and when he got there he wasn't very nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bad move, Ricky.  
</P>
<P>
	There were plenty of other stargazing opportunities. Bryan White  
held court in his booth, which ran continuous clips of The Three 
Stooges. Tanya Tucker offered fans a video tour of her horse 
stables. 
</P>
<P>
	Performances took place at a race track on the far end of the  
fairgrounds. The rest of the action was in several nondescript 
white buildings set on two square miles of concrete -- space 
ordinarily used to showcase livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	There were times when that setting seemed appropriate.  
</P>
<P>
	The stars were herded into the booths, where they were  
displayed, photographed, prodded. They signed anything handed to 
them, and tried act charismatic enough for stardom, yet humble 
enough to be a next-door neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	For fans, the event was a series of long lines interspersed with  
the payoff of a moment with a star. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't explain it, but I wouldn't miss this,'' Hughes said.  
``It's exciting to see them in person, and 99.9 percent of them are 
so nice and grateful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fan Fair made its debut in April 1972, a response to fans  
flooding the annual Country Music DJ convention each October hoping 
to meet the stars. Rather than fight it, the Grand Ole Opry and the 
Country Music Association opted to start an event specifically for 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Five thousand people attended the first Fan Fair at the downtown  
Municipal Auditorium. It moved to June and larger fairgrounds the 
next year, when 10,000 people showed up. 
</P>
<P>
	The festival continued to grow until it ran out of space at  
24,000 visitors. This year, 22,000 people bought $90 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Fan Fair lore includes the tale of Garth Brooks' bladder: He  
signed autographs for 23 hours nonstop, not even taking a bathroom 
break. Then there was Kathy Mattea using a computer to talk to fans 
in 1991 after having vocal surgery. There's even been a Paul 
McCartney sighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Shania Twain met Def Leppard producer Mutt Lange at Fan Fair; he  
went on to produce her breakthrough album ``The Woman in Me.'' He 
also married her. One year Jo Dee Messina got a backstage pass from 
her friend, Tim McGraw, then schmoozed her way to a record deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, Patty Loveless stood in line for Vince Gill's  
autograph. This year, the pair signed autographs together to 
promote a duet single. 
</P>
<P>
	This year had a drop in attendance, attributed by most insiders  
to the closing of the Opryland USA theme park two years ago, and 
the absence of several top stars this year. Twain was on tour, Reba 
McEntire was shooting a movie and Brooks was working on an album. 
</P>
<P>
	But organizers put a positive spin on the smaller numbers.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing more merchandise sold, more program books sold  
and as much product sold in the onsite record store -- even with 
slightly fewer fans this year,'' said Ed Benson of the CMA. ``These 
are the really committed fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benson said the crowd was younger than usual, but the kiddy  
crowd seemed to be mostly children brought by their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Country music, at least the kind heard on the radio, is  
wholesome family entertainment. If you don't believe it, consider 
the inspirational bent of the music at Fan Fair. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Warner Bros. show, Michael Peterson extolled the virtues  
of family on ``Something About a Sunday,'' while Claudia Church 
told young girls not to date around too much on ``What's the Matter 
With You Baby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Paisley, a West Virginia singer on the verge of stardom,  
sang funny, sad-sack odes about the pitfalls of single life at the 
Arista Records showcase. He then brought the grandstand of 15,000 
to its feet with a song about a man who appreciates his step-dad. 
</P>
<P>
	Sad, beer-drinking and hell-raising music had a minor but  
respected place. George Jones was the highlight of the Asylum 
Records show, singing morbid classics like ``He Stopped Loving Her 
Today'' just three months after his heavy drinking caused a car 
crash that almost killed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery-Gentry, a duo striving to revive the ``outlaw'' image  
of Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings, had the best-selling album on 
the grounds. Jennings made a surprise appearance during the RCA 
show to bestow his outlaw approval on newcomer Andy Griggs. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Arista show, superstar Alan Jackson kicked off the final  
set with his acerbic ``Gone Country,'' a crowd favorite that pokes 
fun at the Johnny-come-latelies who flocked to Nashville in the 
early 1990s, after country music peaked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm Alan Jackson, and this is my band The Strayhorns,'' he  
greeted the cheering audience with perfect country singer modesty. 
``Thanks for coming back this year.'' Jackson had already pleased 
the fans with an unscheduled trip to the autograph booths. 
</P>
<P>
	In a typical bit of Fan Fair hype, Arista president Tim DuBois  
gave Jackson a plaque that was even taller than Jackson's 
6-foot-4-inch frame. It marked a decade of sales of 27 million for 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got passed on by every record company around for five  
years,'' Jackson said. ``Then Tim got sorry for me and gave me a 
deal. I'll never forget it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Day Three of the Fan Fair came a ceremonial groundbreaking  
for the new Country Music Hall of Fame, set for completion in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The mild, sunny weather and a 90-member guitar marching band led  
by Chet Atkins washed away the mounting exhaustion of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``This building goes up in honor of the great commandment: Honor  
thy father and thy mother, so that your days may be long in the 
land that the Lord your God is giving you,'' said Garrison Keillor, 
the Prairie Home Companion radio host who was helping raise money 
to build the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan White performed, and Kathy Mattea did her old hit, ``18  
Wheels and a Dozen Roses.'' She told the audience, ``Somebody, by 
God, ought to do a trucking song today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Vince Gill got up and showed why people return to Fan Fair  
year after year -- why country music remains relevant. Saying 
Keillor's words inspired him, he sang his simple song, ``The Key to 
Life,'' a tribute to his late father. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I will honor my father with these words I write down/And  
as long as I remember him he'll always be around/And the pain of 
losing him cuts like a Randall knife/I learned a few chords on the 
banjo, was the key to life,'' Gill sang, barely holding his 
composure on the last chorus. 
</P>
<P>
	In the audience, country music moguls blinked away tears.  
</P>
<P>
	Marty Stuart, clutching a guitar played by ``the father of  
country music,'' Jimmie Rodgers, followed with a fiery speech 
declaring the site ``holy ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A smattering of fans watched from the upper reaches of temporary  
risers. They didn't seem to mind that the best seats were reserved 
for reporters, music industry workers and other ``VIPs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the ceremony ended with Earl Scruggs and his son, Randy,  
leading assorted stars in ``Will the Circle Be Unbroken,'' the 
crowd lingered as one, not wanting the moment to end. 
</P>
<P>
	But it did.  
</P>
<P>
	After all, there were more booths to visit, more stars to touch.

<HEADLINE> La Nina Seems To Be Vanishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The weather-altering La Nina phenomenon  
has all but vanished from the Pacific Ocean, satellite observations 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	The pool of unusually cool tropical water marked by low sea  
levels has shriveled and the equatorial Pacific is warming to 
normal temperatures, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists cautioned that like its warm counterpart, El Nino, a  
La Nina condition will influence global climate and weather until 
it has completely subsided. La Nina has also shrunk several times 
and then had a resurgence over the past 12 months, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the United States, an El Nino brings unusually warm  
temperatures to the northern states and cooler, wetter conditions 
to the southern tier of states. 
</P>
<P>
	La Nina is linked to cooler conditions in central North America,  
and dry, warm conditions in the southern states.

<HEADLINE> Gene Links Cancer Risk to Blacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Genetic mutations identified in some blacks  
have been found to increase their risk for cancer of the colon and 
rectum, a new study says. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding by researchers from Roswell Park Cancer Institute  
could help in early diagnosis of such cancers. 
</P>
<P>
	While similar links between colorectal cancer and specific  
genetic mutations have already been established among a handful of 
nationalities and ethnic groups, the new study was the first to 
focus on blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The results are published in the latest Journal of the American  
Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's third-leading cause of cancer deaths, colorectal  
cancer is expected to strike 129,400 people in the United States 
this year and kill 55,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks suffer higher rates of cancer of the colon and rectum  
than other racial and ethnic groups and die more frequently from 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the researchers said the genetic alterations are  
probably not an explanation for the higher death rate: that is 
largely attributable to late-stage diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, regular screening for cancer is essential, said Dr.  
Thomas Weber, who led the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything we can do to help identify who's at risk and direct  
clinical surveillance to those people would be very helpful,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite easy take-home tests, only about 40 percent of Americans  
over the age of 50 are screened regularly for colorectal cancer, 
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roswell Park research, done over the past two years, looked  
at 11 unrelated black colorectal cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The study determined that defects of the so-called ``mismatch  
repair'' genes, which normally repair DNA in cells that fail to 
replicate properly, contribute to hereditary nonpolyposis 
colorectal cancer, a specific type. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Cancer Society recommends that men and women 50 or  
older get tested annually to detect cancers of the colon or rectum. 
Screening should begin earlier for people with a strong family 
history of cancer.

<HEADLINE> Scher's Conviction Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A doctor serving a life sentence for shooting  
his friend so he could marry his widow walked out of prison on 
Wednesday after a court overturned his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is obviously a very happy day for everybody,'' said  
lawyer John Moses, who represented Dr. Stephen Scher. 
</P>
<P>
	Scher planned to reunite with his wife, the widow of the man he  
is accused of killing, and return with her to their home in 
Lincolnton, N.C., Moses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scher was serving a life sentence for shooting his friend,  
Martin Dillon, at Dillon's hunting camp in 1976, but he was not 
arrested for 20 years, a delay that a state superior court ruled 
violated Scher's due-process rights. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the state Supreme Court ruled Scher could be  
released, but required him to post bond to allow prosecutors time 
to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting had been deemed an accident based on Scher's story  
that he and Dillon were chasing a porcupine when Dillon tripped and 
shot himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years afterward, Scher married Dillon's widow, but  
suspicions lingered and in 1995 authorities exhumed Dillon's body. 
</P>
<P>
	The autopsy concluded Dillon could not have shot himself. No  
powder burns were found on Dillon's skin and the shell had traveled 
downward, not upward. 
</P>
<P>
	At Scher's trial, laboratory tests not available in 1976 showed  
that human blood had spattered on Scher's boots, even though the 
doctor said he was 100 feet away when Dillon was shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Scher changed his story during the trial, testifying that the  
gun went off in a struggle that began when he told Dillon he was 
having an affair with his wife, Patricia. 
</P>
<P>
	Scher said he lied about the shooting for more than two decades  
to protect Dillon's widow and the dead man's two children, whom 
Scher raised. 
</P>
<P>
	In its June 7 ruling overturning the conviction, the superior  
court said the conviction was tainted by memories that had faded, 
evidence that had disappeared and witnesses who had died. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania Attorney General Michael Fisher intends to appeal  
Scher's release, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will argue that the conviction should be reinstated and he  
should be returned to prison to serve out his life sentence for 
first-degree murder,'' spokesman Kevin Harley said.

<HEADLINE> Purdue Basketball Put on Probation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Purdue was placed on probation by  
the NCAA today for two years for major violations involving an 
assistant coach and two others close to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA also cut a scholarship for the men's basketball program  
and limited recruiting visits to the school. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no mention of bans from postseason tournaments or  
restrictions on television appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA Committee on Infractions ruled the university violated  
rules regarding recruiting, extra benefits and ethical conduct. 
There were also several secondary violations in the women's 
basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the school's penalty, it must repay up to 90 percent  
of the revenues generated from the Boilermakers' appearance in the 
1996 men's NCAA tournament, and an assistant men's basketball coach 
was banned from off-campus recruiting for a year.

<HEADLINE> Recipients' First 2 Years Riskiest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Cancer patients who get bone marrow transplants can live pretty  
close to a normal life if they can make it past the first two 
years, according to a study published in today's New England 
Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The risk of dying from a recurrence of the cancer, infection,  
rejection of the transplanted marrow or other causes is highest 
during this period. 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked at patients with any of four diseases that are  
sometimes treated with transplants of bone marrow. It found that 
those who are disease-free after two years have only a 1-in-9 
chance of dying over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though the mortality rate is higher than in the normal  
population, it's pretty low,'' said Dr. Mary Horowitz, scientific 
director of the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry at 
the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee. ``Every day you 
survive, your chance of making it another day gets better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horowitz and colleagues studied records of 6,691 patients at 221  
transplant centers worldwide. The patients received marrow from a 
donor between 1980 and 1993 and, two years after the transplant, 
were still healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	The patients had one of three types of leukemia or an anemia in  
which the marrow, the blood-forming system inside the bones, wasn't 
working. They received high-dose cancer drugs, and often high-dose 
radiation, to kill their non-functioning marrow. Then they were 
injected with the donated marrow -- essentially getting a new blood 
and immune-cell factory. 
</P>
<P>
	Horowitz said the lingering risk, while slight, shows patients  
need frequent checkups for years after the transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'm hoping is the results will increase the likelihood  
that some of these patients will (be able to) get health and life 
insurance after their transplants,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Andrew Pecora, chief of the Blood and Marrow Stem Cell  
Transplant Program at Hackensack University Medical Center in New 
Jersey, said the encouraging results confirm what specialists 
suspected. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the study may help doctors save patients by pushing them  
to eat better, take vitamins, exercise and quit smoking.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lamar Odom's long, bizarre journey finally led  
him to the place most basketball players want to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom, indecisive off the court but tremendously gifted on it,  
was the No. 4 pick in the NBA draft Wednesday night by the Los 
Angeles Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite getting picked by a team that is perennially one of the  
worst in the league, Odom was happy with the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it worked out for the best,'' said Odom, the former New  
York playground star who tried to pull out of the draft and missed 
workouts with several teams. ``I'm not mad. I'm a happy-go-lucky 
camper right now. I'm in the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Odom, 19, must not know much about the history of the Clippers.  
They've been to the playoffs only three times since the franchise 
moved to Los Angeles in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, things happen for a reason,'' Odom said. ``I guess God  
wanted me to be an L.A. Clipper. I'm just going to take it from 
there. Damn, I'm going to be the best L.A. Clipper I can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Studying a crumpled Clippers roster that was printed from a Web  
site, Odom said, ``They've got to start somewhere. Hopefully it's 
me. They've got some talent on this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DUKE'S DOUBLE-DOUBLE:* Duke became the first school to have  
four players selected in the first round -- Elton Brand, Trajan 
Langdon, Corey Maggette and William Avery. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggette, picked 13th by Seattle, said the hardest part of the  
whole process was telling Blue Devils coach Mike Krzyzewski about 
his decision to leave school early. 
</P>
<P>
	``Telling him was very hard for me,'' Maggette said. ``I was  
sitting there, prancing around. But it's all pretty much gone right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils, who lost to Connecticut in the national  
championship game, could have made another run next year if they 
hadn't lost all this talent. Langdon, a surprise pick at No. 11 by 
Cleveland, was the only senior among them. 
</P>
<P>
	Langdon didn't even attend the draft because he didn't believe  
he'd be picked that high. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great player, I knew that all along,'' said Avery, the  
point guard who went 14th to Minnesota. ``I know he could have gone 
through some of his workouts without missing a shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, the No. 1 pick by the Bulls, was booed in Atlantic Coast  
Conference territory when the selection was announced. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *COLOR OF MONEY:* James Posey, picked 18th by the Nuggets, wore  
an olive green suit -- the only first-round pick to wear the color 
of money. 
</P>
<P>
	Conveniently, Wally Szczerbiak wore a blue shirt that was  
identical to the Minnesota Timberwolves' colors. He had a feeling 
he'd be picked No. 6 by the Wolves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they were the one team that realized that I could be  
quick and athletic,'' Szczerbiak said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LATE PICKS:* Connecticut's Richard Hamilton, picked seventh by  
the host Washington Wizards, got a huge ovation when his name was 
announced. ``I haven't heard a crowd get that loud since the NCAA 
championship,'' Hamilton said. ... The Rev. Jesse Jackson was among 
the celebrities seen walking the hallways of the MCI Center. ... 
Priceless moment of the draft: Steve Francis covering his face, 
filling his cheeks with air and looking disappointed when Vancouver 
made him the No. 2 pick. ... Worst dressed: Lamar Odom, who donned 
a tan suit with light blue stripes, a light blue shirt and 
multicolored tie. ... Most curious pick: the New York Knicks taking 
7-foot-2 center Frederic Weis of France with homegrown Ron Artest 
of St. John's still available. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *QUOTE OF THE DRAFT: Ron Artest, the 16th pick by the Bulls, on  
his sleepless night before the draft: ``I was up all night. I was 
ironing clothes that didn't need to be ironed. I was ironing my 
socks, underwear, dollar bills. I went to sleep at like 2 in the 
morning and woke up at 7. I even ironed by brother's pants. I was 
so nervous. Anybody need any clothes ironed? I'll iron anybody's 
clothes.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FALLING STOCK:* Evan Eschmeyer and Lee Nailon were the players  
whose stock dropped the most on draft day. 
</P>
<P>
	Nailon starred as a 6-foot-9 power forward at Texas Christian,  
averaging 23.9 points in two seasons and being named honorable 
mention All-American. Originally an early entry candidate for the 
1998 draft, he changed his mind and withdrew. Perhaps he should 
have done it again. Nailon was finally picked 43rd by Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Eschmeyer, a 6-foot-11 center from Northwestern, dropped all the  
way to 34th before New Jersey took him. Eschmeyer, a sixth-year 
senior, was 12th in the nation in rebounding (10.1) and averaged 19 
points a game in his final two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang Zhizhi, on the other hand, went from not even being  
eligible to being picked 36th in one day. Zhizhi wasn't eligible 
for the draft until Wednesday because of a disagreement over his 
age. He's 22, but the NBA thought he was 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he is one of China's most promising basketball prospects,  
Zhizhi probably won't end up in the NBA for another two or three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GOOD MOVE:* The winner of the best-decision-of-the-draft award  
goes to Leon Smith, a high school player from Chicago who was the 
29th and final pick of the first round by the NBA champion San 
Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	As a first-round pick, Smith gets a three-year guaranteed  
contract worth $1.8 million with a team option for a fourth year. 
Had he slipped one spot to the second round, he would have been 
guaranteed nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was then traded to Dallas for the 40th pick, Goran Giricek  
of Croatia, and a future second-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a 6-foot-10 center from Chicago's Martin Luther King High  
School, was the 1999 Illinois player of the year. He averaged 25.5 
points and 14.5 rebounds, leading his team to a 27-7 record.

<HEADLINE> Earth May Have 'Twin' Somewhere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Earth may have had a twin or even more planetary siblings  
when the solar system was born, only to lose them in the vast 
darkness of deep space, an astronomer says. 
</P>
<P>
	These Earth-like planets are still out there somewhere, and  
despite their wanderings through the cold, dark void, they may be 
capable of supporting life, according to David Stevenson, a 
planetary physicist at the California Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life would have to be simple,'' Stevenson said. ``Certainly  
you wouldn't have much of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson advances the theory in Thursday's issue of the journal  
Nature. According to this theory, these extra Earth-like planets 
were jettisoned into deep space by gravity when they got too close 
to Jupiter or other large planets. 
</P>
<P>
	The theory itself has been around for a while. But Stevenson  
goes a step further, drawing on planetary formation theory, the 
geology of the solar system and his own calculations to argue that 
these Earth siblings may have a dense hydrogen atmosphere and 
enough volcanic heat to sustain warm oceans -- all conditions 
conducive to life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a very logical conclusion from what we know about  
planet formation,'' said Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution in 
Washington, one of the leaders in the search for other solar 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has ever actually found one these so-called rogue  
planets. Nevertheless, there could be millions, even billions, of 
them roaming the galaxy in the dark, carrying water and simple 
life, Stevenson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other scientists agree there is little doubt that planets were  
ejected from the primordial solar system. But they are unsure 
whether these bodies have the atmosphere and other means to sustain 
even simple life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because you can make an atmosphere doesn't mean you can  
keep it,'' said Jonathan Lunine at the University of Arizona. ``You 
have to ask whether that atmosphere, when perturbed very slightly, 
would return to its regular state or just collapse onto the 
surface.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson said that rogue planets could have clouds and even  
lightning, but not the constantly shifting weather on Earth that is 
largely driven by sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The temperature would be very uniform from place to place. It  
would be a dull place in that sense, and of course it would be 
totally dark,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of actually finding a rogue planet is very small  
indeed, scientists agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like finding a grain of sand inside the Earth,'' Boss  
said.

<HEADLINE> Oil Producers File Dumping Petition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Oklahoma-based coalition of independent oil  
producers wants the federal government to investigate whether four 
countries sold crude oil at unusually low prices in the U.S. 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing a 1930 trade law, the coalition known as Save Domestic  
Oil filed a petition Tuesday with the Commerce Department and the 
International Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	A determination of illegal dumping could trigger tariffs against  
Iraq, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-dumping petition alleges the imports are being sold in  
the United States at ``less than normal value'' and that the four 
countries' governments are subsidizing their national oil 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``These unfairly traded imports have materially injured certain  
regional domestic producers manufacturing crude petroleum oil and 
threaten to cause further material injury if remedial action is not 
taken,'' the petition states. 
</P>
<P>
	SDO, based in Enid, Okla., is portraying the coalition's action  
as necessary to defend the vitality of a domestic industry reeling 
from recent economic hardship. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting the huge job losses in the depressed domestic oil  
industry, SDO Chairman Harold Hamm said: ``We believe this action 
is necessary to ensure our nation's long-term energy security by 
maintaining a vital domestic oil industry for the remaining 430,000 
U.S. oilfield workers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson described the  
dumping claim as ``a serious charge, with potentially serious 
consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot comment on the merits of the petition,'' Richardson  
said. ``I can say, however, that U.S. government policy is that the 
forces of supply and demand should set the price of oil and we 
believe that, in the long run, they do.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Population Conference Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Still at odds over sex education and  
abortion, delegates from 180 countries opened a three-day special 
U.N. session Wednesday to find ways to cope with the world's 
population as it nears 6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``To no small extent, your efforts will help determine the way  
future generations live on this Earth: their health, the range of 
their choices, the stability of their societies,'' U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a toast at a luncheon for 
conference participants. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years after 179 countries adopted an ambitious 20-year  
program to curb the world's population at a U.N. conference in 
Cairo, delegates are meeting to decide on new proposals to 
implement it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since Cairo, the world does understand ... that we have to  
stabilize the population of this planet,'' Annan said in his 
opening speech to the General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	The main premise of the Cairo program -- that population and  
development are linked, and that educated women with access to 
reproductive health care have fewer children -- ``seems blindingly 
obvious now,'' he said. ``But until Cairo the world did not fully 
understand it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Julia Taft said the five-year  
review of the Cairo conference had shown that linking women and 
development is taking root in a positive way. 
</P>
<P>
	Countries are reporting reductions in maternal and infant  
mortality because of improved health care, she said, and the 
expansion of education for girls has resulted in lower fertility 
rates and girls becoming more economically valuable to their 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the same divisive issues that dominated the 1994 Cairo  
conference, however, have stalled agreement on new priorities for 
future action. 
</P>
<P>
	One contentious issue is at what age young people should receive  
sex education in school and whether children have a right to 
confidentiality on sex-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The second major issue is whether countries should be asked to  
review laws that punish women for having illegal abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	As in Cairo, the Vatican and its supporters, Argentina,  
Nicaragua and Guatemala, have been the most vocal opponents. In the 
current debate, they have been joined by Libya and Sudan, which did 
not attend the 1994 conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Dr. Nafis Sadik, executive director of the U.N.  
Population Fund, said she was ``very happy'' with the progress so 
far on the final document. And even if the review of abortion laws 
isn't adopted, she said the debate is important. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before people never wanted to discuss it. It was shoved under  
the table,'' she said. ``Now it's being discussed, particularly how 
we should address and deal with it, recognizing that these are 
unwanted pregnancies -- and the first intention of women and girls 
is not an abortion, but not to have become pregnant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the drafting team continued to work on the final document,  
government representatives from nearly 50 countries spoke to the 
General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, the only head of state  
attending, said that after the Cairo summit, his country had almost 
tripled to 1 million the number of couples using some means of 
birth control. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the gap between rich and poor countries increasing, he  
said ``we are seeing a renewal of the vicious circle -- unwanted 
children and poverty'' in the developing world. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must give couples information so they can freely decide on  
the size of their families,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Jumps on Fed Announcement / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been  
down most of the day, is up more than 100 points on the Federal 
Reserve's announcement of a 25 basis-point hike in interest rates. 
Just before 2 p.m. EDT, the Dow industrials were down 51.61 to 
10,763.74. Just after the Fed's 2:15 p.m. EDT announcement, the Dow 
was up 106.70 to 10,922.05. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2:30 p.m. EDT, the Dow was up 147.86 to 10,963.21.  
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 37.68 at 10,777.67. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also slightly lower at that time.  
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 10.46 at 1,340.99, and the 
Nasdaq composite index was down 13.79 at 2,628.32. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices were also lower, sending yields on the 30-year  
Treasury bond to 6.08, up from 6.06 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were eagerly awaiting the announcement, hoping for an  
end to the volatile price swings and sluggish trading that has 
characterized the market since the Fed first signaled in May its 
willingness to raise rates in an effort to hold off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	As the second quarter and first half drew to a close today, some  
money managers took profits, settling their portfolios after a 
two-day rally that lifted major market indexes earlier this week. 
David G. Sowerby, a vice president at Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co., 
shrugged off the pressure of the Fed's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most anticipated rate hike in the history of the  
Fed,'' he said. ``At this point, the market would only really sour 
if they didn't raise rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of long-distance phone companies were mostly lower after  
one Wall Street analyst predicted a price war. MCI WorldCom fell 6 3/8 
to 87 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney slipped 3/4 to 29 3/8 after reports that Merrill Lynch analyst  
Jessica Reif Cohen forecast lower earnings for fiscal years 1999 
and 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 491.35 million 
shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace but still fairly quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. EDT, the NYSE composite index was down 2.37 at 635.62,  
and the American Stock Exchange composite index was up 6.63 at 
784.11. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index, which measures the performance of  
smaller companies, rose 1.60 to 455.68.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Medicare Plan Is Affordable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Saying the nation is too prosperous to relegate  
older Americans to a life of sickliness and worry, President 
Clinton today appealed for passage of his Medicare drug plan. ``It 
is constructed in a way America can afford,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president addressed an audience of about 350 senior citizens  
and others at the Chicago Cultural Center, which offers various 
programs for older people. He won generous applause as he argued 
that a cost cannot be put on the lives of older Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that goes way beyond health care and way  
beyond money,'' Clinton said. ``How do you put a price on being 
able to see the birth of a grandchild?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not welfare. This is not some blind gift,'' Clinton  
said. ``This is something we are doing for the integrity of 
families through the generations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president traveled to Chicago for the first of several  
national visits by top administration officials to sell the 
Medicare proposal directly to senior citizens. Later tonight, he 
was speaking at a fund-raising dinner that expected to bring in 
$500,000 for the Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Clinton proposed several changes in Medicare. The  
most significant would have the government help the disabled and 
people 65 and older pay for prescription drugs under Medicare -- up 
to $1,000 a year initially in return for a $24 monthly patient 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The maximum federal payment for drugs would climb to $2,500 by  
2008 as the monthly patient fee rose to $44 in gradual, annual 
steps. However, beneficiaries with annual incomes below $11,000 for 
individuals and $17,000 for couples would pay no premium or 
cost-sharing for drug coverage up to the annual limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the president listened to stories of elderly people  
having to choose between groceries and prescriptions, or stretching 
out their pills to make them last longer -- putting themselves at 
risk of serious illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way I can do without these medications,'' said  
Hanna Bratman, 79, a widow who said she spends $2,800 a year -- 
about 10 percent of her income -- on asthma drugs. ``It's hard to 
describe the fear of not knowing whether you'll be able to afford 
the next medication the doctor prescribes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please do everything you can do to make sure seniors ... can  
get the prescription drugs they need to have,'' Mrs. Bratman told 
Clinton. ``This is just the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Esposito, a geriatric pharmacist in Cicero, Ill., said it  
breaks her heart to watch elderly customers discover they lack 
coverage for their medication, or cannot find other coverage 
because they were rejected as too ill, or literally scrape funds 
together to pay out of their pockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Some advocates for the elderly say Clinton's plan doesn't go far  
enough, and medical industry leaders wonder if they're going to 
wind up paying for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders questioned how the plan would be financed,  
who would pay, whether it would fix Medicare's solvency problems 
and whether his proposed cost restrictions might hinder medical 
breakthroughs and drug innovations. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Democrats, meanwhile, criticized Republicans for  
not immediately and wholeheartedly embracing Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``My fear is that the Republican reaction to this is negative,''  
said House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., at a news 
conference today. ``It's clear to me that the Republican leadership 
simply is responding to special interests and not to the interests 
of ordinary Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether retirees will see Clinton's plan as a good deal remains  
to be seen, said Horace Deets, executive director of the American 
Association of Retired Persons, the nation's largest organization 
of older adults. 
</P>
<P>
	``It requires that Medicare beneficiaries still pay a  
considerable amount of the cost of their drugs and only a vigorous 
public debate will tell us whether older Americans believe that the 
additional premium for prescriptions is affordable,'' said Deets. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if not enacted this year, Clinton's initiative will set the  
markers for a political brawl in next year's elections. It is a 
potent issue because Medicare touches the lives of 39 million 
Americans, and the elderly show up to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and  
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., pledged to seek ``a 
bipartisan solution to expand access to affordable prescription 
drugs.'' Lott expressed interest in providing prescription drugs to 
elderly Americans who ``are poor and cannot afford what they 
need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, health care providers from HMOs to hospitals worried  
that they will be made to sacrifice billions of dollars in payments 
to help achieve Medicare savings to pay for Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``As caregivers, we recognize that prescription drugs are an  
important part of treating illness and enhancing wellness,'' said 
American Hospital Association president Dick Davidson. ``But before 
we expand benefits -- and make new promises -- to Medicare 
beneficiaries, it is essential that we keep our current promises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative groups joined Republican lawmakers in questioning  
whether government-subsidized prescription drug benefits are truly 
needed by all 39 million Medicare beneficiaries, when two-thirds 
already have drug coverage -- mainly from privately purchased 
insurance or retirement benefits from employers.

<HEADLINE> Former Browns Lineman Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Walter Johnson, a former defensive lineman for  
the Cleveland Browns, died Tuesday after suffering a heart attack 
at his suburban Cleveland home. He was 56. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is the second former prominent Browns player to die in  
the past few days. Hall of Famer Marion Motley, 79, died Sunday at 
his son's home in Cleveland after fighting prostate cancer for more 
than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Drafted in 1965 out of California State-Los Angeles, Johnson, a  
6-foot-5, 265-pound tackle, once played in 167 consecutive games 
before retiring after the 1976 season. 
</P>
<P>
	He insisted on playing in the entire 1969 title game despite  
suffering frozen fingers in 8-degree weather in Bloomington, Minn. 
Minnesota beat Cleveland 27-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who wore No. 71 with the Browns, anchored a defensive  
line which also featured Pro Bowler Jerry Sherk. 
</P>
<P>
	As a rookie, Johnson learned from starter Dick Modzelewski and  
took Modzelewski's spot on the line when he retired in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was born in Cincinnati and graduated from the city's  
Taft High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Services were pending Wednesday night.

<HEADLINE> Marv Albert Rehired by NBC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Marv Albert can thank Fox for his return to NBC.  
</P>
<P>
	That's because NBC sports chairman Dick Ebersol read recent  
reports that Albert and Fox were negotiating a deal for Albert to 
join the network's NFL coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	So Ebersol acted quickly, bringing Albert back to NBC, where he  
began his network career in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was actually reading that Marv was in discussions with Fox,  
and it told me that this was the opportunity to move or we wouldn't 
be able to do this for three or four years,'' Ebersol said. ``I 
realized I'd better react immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert returned to NBC after being fired less than two years ago  
after he pleaded guilty in a sex case. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox executive producer Ed Goren understood Albert's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``On the one hand, we were looking forward to Marv being part of  
the NFL on Fox, but I'm thrilled that Marv will be back on NBC, 
where he belongs,'' Goren said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert, who once again will announce NBA games for the network,  
called his return ``kind of a euphoria -- a nice, weird feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just so happy to be back. ... There will be plenty of  
national exposures and I'm very satisfied to come home,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert won't return to his former role as the network's top  
play-by-play man for NBA games, but will complement its existing 
broadcast teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert, who agreed to a multiyear deal, will work about 15  
regular-season NBA games and the first four weekends of the 
playoffs. He will also be involved in boxing telecasts during the 
2000 Olympics and hockey in the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert began his national comeback this season when he was hired  
by Turner Sports in February to work NBA games. 
</P>
<P>
	He will make his return to NBC, where he worked from 1977-1997,  
before the end of the year -- probably on a studio show or NBC's 
first NBA telecast on Christmas Day. He will also continue with a 
full slate of some 25 regular-season games and a handful of 
postseason games on Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert also resigned from Madison Square Garden network shortly  
after being fired by NBC, but was brought back on board with MSG 
one year ago as the anchor of ``MSG Sports Desk'' and as the radio 
play-by-play voice for half of the New York Knicks games. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert's Turner debut came on TNT's broadcast of the Los Angeles  
Lakers game at Phoenix on April 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's better for me to look ahead than look back,'' Albert  
said. ``Everything's gone in the right direction in the past 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His last NBA national telecast for NBC was the finals in 1997.  
He also worked the NFL playoffs later that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault charges in  
September 1997 after being accused of biting his lover's back in a 
hotel room during a sexual encounter.

<HEADLINE> China 2, Russia 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Pu Wei and Jin Yan scored as China, one  
of the tournament favorites, beat Russia 2-0 Wednesday night in the 
Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	China moved on to a semifinal match Sunday at Foxboro, Mass.,  
against the winner of Wednesday night's Sweden-Norway game. 
</P>
<P>
	The score wasn't indicative of the one-sided nature of the game,  
most of which was played in the Russian half of the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese peppered Russian goalkeeper Svetlana Petko with 24  
shots and the Russians, surprise quarterfinalists in their first 
World Cup, got off only two shots while spending most of the time 
chasing Chinese attackers. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's strongest attacker, Irina Grigorieva, who led the  
tournament going into the game with four assists, was stymied with 
defensive duty back in the penalty box. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese midfielder Pu was the first to score, kicking a slow,  
bouncing shot from outside the penalty box late in the first half. 
Petko, perhaps exhausted from about a dozen earlier saves, reacted 
late and watched the ball slide past the tips of her gloves. 
</P>
<P>
	The baby of the Chinese team at 18, Pu fell to her knees,  
thrilled with her first World Cup goal, before jumping up in glee. 
</P>
<P>
	China scored again 10 minutes into the second half, when Jin  
knocked in the rebound of a shot that bounced off the post. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian loss was not unexpected. The team was one of the  
surprises in the tournament, advancing from its group with 
victories over Japan and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's defenders used an array of strong tactics to keep China  
from running up the score, pushing beyond the usual slide tackles 
and tight marking. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 16th minute, Russian defender Natalia Karasseva was  
carried off the field on a stretcher after being cracked across the 
face diving to head a ball clear of the goal. After an ice pack and 
some rest, she returned to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the first half, Tatiana Tcheverda was penalized with a  
yellow card when she batted the ball away with her hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the sweaty, red-faced fans seemed to be dazed by the  
strong sun and 87 degree heat, although pockets of flag-waving fans 
cheered wildly for China -- filling the stadium with the sounds of 
clashing cymbals and bells when their team came close to the goal.

<HEADLINE> FDX Earnings Rise 30 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- FDX Corp. reported Wednesday its  
fourth-quarter earnings rose 30 percent on strong gains in its 
flagship Federal Express business. 
</P>
<P>
	FDX, which operates the nation's biggest overnight package  
delivery service, reported net income of $221 million, or 74 cents 
per share, in the quarter ended May 31. That compared to $171 
million, or 58 cents per share in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $4.38 billion from $4.08 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Frederick W. Smith, the company's president and chief executive,  
said the increase was due largely to a strong market for overnight 
deliveries at Federal Express, the company's largest subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	At FedEx, fourth-quarter operating income came to $306 million  
on revenue of $3.6 billion, compared to year-earlier operating 
income of $261 million and revenue of $3.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full fiscal year, FDX reported earnings of $631 million,  
or $2.13 a share, up from $503 million, or $1.72 a share, in the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Total revenues for the year were $16.77 billion, up from $15.9  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	FDX also owns RPS Inc., Viking Freight Inc., Roberts Express  
Inc. and FDX Global Logistics Inc.

<HEADLINE> Heredity, Cervix Cancer Link Shown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A study of Swedish women offers some of the best evidence yet  
that heredity plays a role in cervical cancer, a disease blamed 
mostly on infection by a sexually transmitted virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists know that the human papilloma virus can lead to  
cancer of the cervix in a small fraction of cases. But they have 
long suspected that genetics plays a role in at least some cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers looked at public health records on mothers and  
daughters to reach their conclusion. They did not estimate what 
percentage of cervical cancer cases might be attributable to 
heredity. 
</P>
<P>
	The study published in today's issue of the journal Nature was  
led by Ulf Gyllensten, a geneticist at the University of Uppsala in 
Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, based solely on statistics, is considered exceptional  
because of the detail provided by Swedish records, and the highly 
stable and homogeneous population in the Scandinavian country. 
</P>
<P>
	``This certainly gives us more of a reason to believe it's  
related to genetics,'' said Dr. Wendy Brewster, an epidemiology 
expert at the University of California at Irvine. ``For so long 
with cervical cancer it's been argued that it's environmental, or a 
sexually transmitted cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gyllensten compared the Swedish cancer registry, which contains  
records of all cancer diagnosed in Sweden between 1958 and 1993, 
against the Swedish national registry of parents of people born 
after 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked at nearly 127,000 relatives of 71,533 women  
with cervical cancer. It tracked mothers and daughters in the same 
families, and distinguished between biological and adoptive 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The results showed a strong link in the risk of cervical cancer  
between women related biologically. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study doesn't tell us what gene it's on, or whether it's  
multiple genes, but it's very exciting,'' Brewster said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also indicated that women are at risk for cervical  
cancer at a younger age if they had a mother or sister with the 
disease. That typically is true of most types of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The human papilloma virus is the nation's most common sexually  
transmitted disease, infecting up to half the women in the United 
States with between 100 and 200 different strains, said Denise 
Galloway of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	But only a tiny percentage of women get one of the few dangerous  
strains that cause cervical cancer. The disease affects about 
16,000 American women a year, and about 5,000 die.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened mixed. The Dow Jones  
industrial average is down 19 points in today's early going. 
Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange hold a narrow lead over

<HEADLINE> Congressman Pushes Campaign Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A congressman's contention that his campaign  
finance proposal could pass Congress this year, although the House 
killed it last year, drew skepticism from at least one member of a 
committee reviewing the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``How is it that a bill that can't pass the House is something  
that we should hang our hats on?'' Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Pa., said 
Tuesday. ``That's a little bit like saying we could win the Super 
Bowl if we could just get out of the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said the odds for his bill improved  
when the campaign finance bill that did pass the House died in the 
Senate. He urged the House Administration Committee to send his 
proposal to the floor for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's do not repeat the same sequence we had in the last  
Congress,'' he said, characterizing his measure as one that ``meets 
the test of political reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's do something different,'' said Hutchinson, who commented  
at the second in a series of hearings on more than two dozen 
pending reform proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders have promised a floor vote in September. But  
advocates of reform say that won't leave the Senate enough time to 
act. Democrats are trying to force a vote before then, but remained 
short of the 218 votes needed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	The House rejected Hutchinson's bill last year, 221-147. It  
would ban ``soft money'' -- the unlimited, unregulated donations 
that are supposed to help finance political party activities -- at 
the federal level. It also would require new disclosures from 
private groups running issue ads and increase contribution limits 
based on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed, 252-179, a rival proposal that was backed by  
more than half of the 100-member Senate, but didn't have the 60 
votes needed to move it to the floor for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson doubted those additional votes would materialize this  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to present something to the Senate that can acquire  
the additional votes rather than repeat the same steps,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., co-sponsor of the  
House-passed bill, said it was unwise to try to anticipate what the 
Senate will or won't do. 
</P>
<P>
	His measure would eliminate soft money at the federal and state  
levels, regulate issue advertisements and expand disclosure 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Shays, sharing the witness table with Hutchinson, said he  
believed his bill could pass the Senate this year. But if it 
failed, he promised to work on behalf of whatever campaign finance 
bill the House sends to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have a corrupt campaign system. I don't think it  
just looks corrupt. It is corrupt and it's getting worse,'' Shays 
said. ``It is absolutely essential to get a good campaign bill to 
the Senate as soon as possible.''

<HEADLINE> Bulls Select Brand, Artest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- The future of the Chicago Bulls is Elton  
Brand. 
</P>
<P>
	With the first pick in Wednesday's draft, the  
six-time-champions-turned-cellar-dwellars chose Brand, the 
collegiate player of the year. It was Chicago's first-ever No. 1 
pick, and he'll be the cornerstone as the Bulls try to rebuild 
their shattered dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was totally surprised,'' Brand said in a teleconference from  
Washington, D.C., where the draft was held. ``It was a great 
feeling. I'm still totally elated right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls picked Brand after a late flirtation with Lamar Odom,  
whose ``Yes, I'm in the draft. No, wait a minute, I'm not,'' 
flip-flop two weeks ago confused many teams. He blew off workouts 
and, until last weekend, no team but Vancouver had talked to him. 
</P>
<P>
	But Odom finally came to Chicago for a workout Tuesday night,  
and it looked as if his athletic skills might have won the Bulls 
over. Brand said he learned of Odom's late visit Wednesday morning, 
but stayed calm. 
</P>
<P>
	And when commissioner David Stern called his name, the forward  
from Duke sighed and a huge grin crossed his face. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still was very confident in my skills and work ethic and the  
way I played,'' Brand said. ``I think the GMs and coaches were 
pleasantly surprised in my skills. I didn't get to showcase them 
all at Duke this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Say what? Brand, 20, was the first player ever to leave Duke as  
an underclassman. As a sophomore, he averaged 16.2 points and 9.8 
rebounds last to lead the Blue Devils into the NCAA championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial concerns about his height were erased when he measured  
just over 6-8 without his sneakers. His arm span is huge; he's got 
a vertical reach of over nine feet, and his horizontal span is 
7-5 1/2. At 260 pounds, he can play defense with the best of them, but 
he's got soft hands, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just an outstanding person,'' general manager Jerry  
Krause said. ``It was a very tough decision. We just came to a 
decision that we think Elton Brand is an outstanding player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he's going to have to play right away. Brand has been  
working out with a personal trainer and the Duke staff since he 
declared for the draft, and he knows how much is expected of him. 
After six championships in eight years, the Bulls finished 13-37 
this year, the worst record in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	With no Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen or Dennis Rodman, the  
Bulls reached all kinds of new lowlights. Their .260 winning 
percentage was the lowest in franchise history, beating out the 
1975-76 squad, which finished 24-58 with a .293 winning percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	Their average of 81.9 points was the lowest scoring average in  
NBA history since the inception of the shot clock. Entering this 
season, the lowest average was 87.4 points in 72 games by the 
Milwaukee Hawks in 1954-55, the season the clock was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	That's going to change, Brand said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely going to show some patience,'' Brand said.  
``Help rebuild the Chicago Bulls and get them back to where they 
should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls also had the 16th pick in the first round, and took  
Ron Artest from St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just so happy right now,'' Artest said, tears rolling down  
his cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 pick is the highest the Bulls have had. They've had  
the No. 2 spot twice, taking David Greenwood in 1979 and Scott May 
three years earlier. They've had the third pick twice, also, using 
one of them to take Jordan in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Their last ``important'' pick was way back in 1989, when Chicago  
had the sixth pick and took Stacey King.

<HEADLINE> Garry Shandling Suit Set for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Garry Shandling is best known for comedy. But  
his $100 million lawsuit against his former manager is shaping up 
as a drama with implications that could stretch across Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, which was to begin today, pits Shandling, perhaps  
best known for the award-winning ``The Larry Sanders Show'' on HBO, 
against Brad Grey, who was executive producer of the now-defunct 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Shandling says that Grey had a conflict of interest by acting as  
his manager and the show's producer. The lawsuit alleges that Grey 
was able to ``triple-dip,'' taking excess commissions and fees out 
of the series. 
</P>
<P>
	It also claims Grey used Shandling's name to make $200  
million-plus in deals with ABC, MCA and Columbia Pictures and owes 
him a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The case could affect the growing number of personal managers  
who double as TV producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rory Rosegarten manages comedian Ray Romano and is an executive  
producer on his CBS sitcom ``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jenna Elfman is managed by Erwin More and Brian Medavoy, among  
the executive producers on her ABC series ``Dharma &AMP; Greg.'' 
Another client is Laura San Giacomo of ``Just Shoot Me,'' which 
also lists the two as executive producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Shandling's complaints, actors often lobby for such  
participation because of the belief their manager will be 
protective of them. 
</P>
<P>
	But the trend has caused fits in other quarters. It adds to a  
series' costs and can create tensions between producers who are 
more hands-on than managers who may carry the title but not the 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	A manager who gets a producing credit on a show can earn about  
$15,000 per episode, The Hollywood Reporter said. That's about 
$330,000 a season. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-decade relationship between Shandling and Grey, who  
collaborated on ``Larry Sanders'' (a behind-the-scenes look at a 
fictional talk show) and ``It's Garry Shandling's Show,'' ended 
when Grey resigned as Shandling's manager in late 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Grey's lawyer, Bert Fields has called the lawsuit filed in  
January 1998 ``sheer lunacy'' and ``nuts.'' He contends Shandling 
had nothing to do with building Grey's business outside of 
producing his own show. 
</P>
<P>
	But Walter Isaacson, Shandling's lawyer, said his client has the  
facts on his side. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that Mr. Shandling's case based on the conflicts of  
interest, breaches of trust and issues of fraud discussed in the 
complaint ... will make a persuasive case at trial,'' he said last 
week.

<HEADLINE> Gates, Intel Boss Seem Aligned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURLINGAME, Calif. (AP) -- Microsoft's Bill Gates and Intel's  
Craig Barrett made a show of cooperation today despite Intel's 
recent investment in Linux, a computer operating system challenging 
Microsoft's software dominance. 
</P>
<P>
	The CEOs of the largest personal computer software company and  
the biggest chip-making firm emphasized their joint commitment to 
dominating the global workstation market in speeches to a 
conference of analysts and workstation customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concept of us banging heads is typically overblown in the  
press,'' said Barrett, characterizing his company as ``agnostic'' 
in an industry where godlike powers are attributed to Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to see all software running on our hardware --  
both Linux and Microsoft,'' said Barrett, who praised both 
alternatives at the annual Workstation Leadership Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	While Linux has some technical advantages, Barrett predicted  
that within the next five years, there will be one billion 
connected computers around the world, most of them powered by Intel 
chips and running Microsoft software. 
</P>
<P>
	``Intel architecture and Windows-based workstations are really  
the platforms of choice, the preferred platform for the workstation 
industry,'' said Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft in recent months has had to respond to challenges to  
its dominance by the upstart Linux, an operating system supported 
both financially and technically by Intel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's simple. We compete with Linux,'' Gates said, emphasizing  
Microsoft's common ground with Intel and dismissing the threat of 
Linux as limited to universities and Internet service providers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a bit like U.S. and French relations,'' observed Drew  
Peck, a technology analyst at SG Cowen Securities in Boston, Mass. 
``They want to generate a public image of camaraderie when 
obviously the friction is getting ever more intense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Erbschloe, vice president of research at Computer  
Economics in Carlsbad, Calif., said Intel and Microsoft are trying 
to convince consumers and analysts that ``neither one of these 
companies are going to jump ahead of each other, product-wise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erbschloe said the growing popularity of Linux, a well-regarded  
version of the Unix operating system used by businesses to run 
computer networks and Internet sites, is shaking up Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel bought a multimillion-dollar stake in VA Research, a  
Mountain View, Calif.-based maker of business computers that run on 
Linux, earlier this year. And Intel's workstation products division 
general manager, Anand Chandrasekher, said Intel's commitment to 
Microsoft doesn't undermine its relationship with Linux users. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our task is to enable all operating systems to work best on  
Intel architecture,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies are eager to show how Microsoft's software and  
Intel's chips are helping businesses. For example, Robert Mondavi 
Winery is using them to make digital maps and analyze data to 
determine where to plant certain vines. And Sony Pictures 
Imageworks used the combined technologies for their upcoming 
digitally animated movie ``Stuart Little,'' based on the classic 
E.B. White book. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint announcement comes at a time when both companies are  
struggling to get products out. Intel's Merced chip is now promised 
for mid-2000, along with Microsoft's Windows 2000.

<HEADLINE> Tour de France Ends Ban on Virenque </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The Tour de France reluctantly lifted its drug-  
related ban on rider Richard Virenque on Wednesday, but general 
director Jean-Marie Leblanc said there will be a legal fight to 
restore the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's most prestigious cycling race was ordered by the  
International Cycling Union on Tuesday to allow Virenque to race. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Leblanc said the order will be obeyed, he called it a  
``takeover by force, three days before the start of the Tour de 
France.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been prevented from leading our rehabilitation (of the  
Tour),'' he said, adding that race will go to the court to try 
maintain its position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I accept the term snub, but it is not a U-turn,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Virenque, one of France's most popular riders, was barred  
because he is among those being investigated for using banned 
substances. Last year's competition was virtually overshadowed by 
disclosures that some riders were using performance-enhancing 
drugs. Several were thrown out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The cycling union cited a technical error as the reason for  
ordering the lifting this year's ban on Virenque. 
</P>
<P>
	The Frenchman, a member of the Festina team last year, but now  
with Polti, was ``not welcome'' because ``his presence would be 
incompatible with the image of the Tour, and the one we want to 
preserve,'' Leblanc said when Virenque was barred from the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Festina was at the center of the drug controversy that marred  
last year's race. 
</P>
<P>
	While several of his former Festina colleagues admitted to drug  
use, Virenque has always denied knowingly taking banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
	The UCI also ordered race officials to change another decision  
and allow Manolo Saiz, director of the Spanish team ONCE, to work 
at the race. 
</P>
<P>
	That prompted Laurent Jalabert, the Spanish team's top rider and  
the world's top cyclist, to change his mind about boycotting the 
race, France-Info radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the UCI's decision brought an angry reaction from  
French bank Credit Lyonnais, one of the Tour de France's four main 
sponsors, saying it would reconsider its backing of the race.

<HEADLINE> Litton Pleads Guilty to Bribery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two Litton Industries units pleaded guilty  
Wednesday to fraud and conspiracy and agreed to pay $18.5 million 
to settle allegations that the company made illegal payments to 
obtain defense business in Greece and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton Applied Technology Division, based in San Jose, Calif.,  
pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to defraud the 
government. Litton Systems Inc. Canada pleaded guilty to the same 
charge, plus one count each of mail fraud and causing a false 
statement to be made to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiated plea ends investigations of a $150 million deal  
to sell radar for F-16 fighter planes to Greece and $47 million in 
contracts to upgrade Taiwanese military aircraft. In both cases, 
the company was accused of making the payments to private 
consultants for help in getting business. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies will pay a $16.5 million fines and $2 million to  
reimburse the Justice Department for the cost of its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The investigation, both in its scope and its thoroughness,  
should send a message that corporate disregard for laws designed to 
curb corruption in connection with the sale of military products 
will not be tolerated,'' U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas said in a 
news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodland Hills-based Litton, in a statement, said the pleas  
would allow the company to put the matter to rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although Litton believed it had meritorious defenses, this  
settlement ... was determined to be in the company's best 
interests,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Taiwan case, prosecutors accused the Litton units of  
paying more than $4.3 million to a retired Taiwanese Air Force 
major, for using his contacts to help secure contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	In Greece, the Applied Technology Division allegedly paid more  
than $12 million to four Greek agents for help in selling the F-16 
radar in 1993. Most of the payments were uncovered in 1997 during 
federal audits of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	In both cases the companies were accused of hiding the payments  
from U.S. regulators. Federal law does not ban the use of foreign 
consultants, but requires the disclosure of any commissions that 
are promised or paid.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- GOP presidential hopeful Elizabeth Dole, who  
has been campaigning for months, said Wednesday she will officially 
declare her candidacy this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is essential that the next president return honesty and  
integrity to the government, restore our public schools to 
greatness, reduce taxes and strengthen our national defense,'' Dole 
said in a statement. ``I intend to speak my mind on these issues 
and I intend to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's campaign has been stymied by Texas Gov. George W. Bush's  
entry into the race. Despite leading Vice President Al Gore in some 
polls, she is running a distant second to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, whose dismal fund-raising in the first quarter of the year  
hurt her campaign, reported raising a much improved $2.7 million in 
the second quarter of this year, bringing her to a total of $3.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has raised over $36 million this year.  
</P>

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Christian Coalition, seeking to bolster  
its faltering influence among the Republican Party, announced 
Wednesday a voter registration drive in churches across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The group hopes to register ``one million religious conservative  
voters'' before the 2000 election. The registration drive is part 
of the Christian Coalition's ``21 Victory'' campaign, a large 
get-out-the-vote effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The Christian Coalition ``is dedicated to seeing that people of  
faith exercise their civic duty and register to vote,'' said Pat 
Robertson, founder of the coalition and a 1988 presidential 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition, a major force in Republican politics for more  
than a decade, has seen some of its influence shrink of late. Among 
other hits to its agenda, front-runner Texas Gov. George W. Bush 
has refused to rule out placing an abortion rights justice on the 
Supreme Court -- long a critical issue for the group. 
</P>

<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- New Hampshire, the traditional  
first-in-the-nation presidential primary state, could hold its 
primary this year -- not in the election year -- under a bill signed 
by Gov. Jeanne Shaheen. 
</P>
<P>
	``This law sends a message loud and clear that New Hampshire  
will do what it takes to preserve its first-in-the-nation status,'' 
Shaheen said on signing the bill late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary schedule is stacked with early, important tests as  
more and more states vie to influence the outcome of the 
presidential race by moving their primaries up. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, which took effect immediately, gives the state more  
flexibility in setting its primary date and deterring other states 
from usurping New Hampshire's role. The state's old law required 
the primary to be at least one week before any other state's, but 
specified that it had to be held in a presidential election year. 
The new law would let the primary be held the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire's primary typically is in mid-February, eight days  
after the Iowa caucuses, which are tentatively set for Feb. 7. 
However, Secretary of State William Gardner is waiting to see what 
other states do before setting the date. He has said the latest it 
will be held is Feb. 8 because South Carolina wants to hold its 
primary Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington state has chosen Feb. 29 and Delaware is pushing for  
Feb. 12, or whichever Saturday follows the New Hampshire primary, 
which is always on a Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law moves up the filing period for candidates from  
December to November and asks presidential candidates not to 
participate in any similar election scheduled within seven days of 
New Hampshire's.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Tokyo Stocks Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar fell against the yen Wednesday  
after senior Bank of Japan officials sparked notions that a rise in 
Japanese interest rates is on the horizon. Tokyo share prices 
closed lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.86 yen in late trading, down 0.40 yen from  
late Tuesday in Tokyo and below its late New York level of 121.06 
yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 252.05 points,  
or 1.42 percent, to close the day's trading at 17,529.74. On 
Tuesday, the average closed up 172.21 points, or 0.98 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency exchange, the dollar fell against the yen after  
traders interpreted comments by Bank of Japan governor Masaru 
Hayami as a sign of a future rate hike. Higher interest rates 
increase the yield on yen-denominated assets, making the currency 
more attractive to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayami said Wednesday that the bank was currently keeping  
interest rates low as an emergency measure to help Japan's battered 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``But at the same time, we have to be careful in considering the  
next policy step,'' he continued. ``We'll take the next step only 
after sufficient and thorough study of how the situation 
develops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traders seized on the words ``next step'' as a sign of departure  
from previous comments reiterating the BOJ's intention to maintain 
its easy monetary policy, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Following close on the heels of those remarks, BOJ Vice Governor  
Yutaka Yamaguchi said the central bank was closely monitoring the 
economic impact of the prolonged ultra-easy monetary policy -- 
suggesting the bank may be worried about negative effects. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 125.06 yen, down  
from 12 In 5.48 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock exchange, the Nikkei average had been up earlier  
the day but dropped after the government announced that total 
construction orders received by Japan's 50 leading domestic 
contractors in May fell 11.3 percent from the same month the year 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	``This just highlights how bad the market interprets these  
figures,'' said Robert Sasaki, head of the quantitative strategy 
group at Jardine Fleming Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous day, the Nikkei average had closed at its highest  
level in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 9.04 points, or 0.63 percent, to 1,416.20. 
The TOPIX closed up 7.78 points, or 0.55 percent, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 548 million shares, up from 474 million shares 
Tuesday. Declining shares outnumbered advances 732 to 451, while 
137 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government bond rose to  
1.8350 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.805 percent, driving its 
price down to 99.70 yen from 99.95 yen.

<HEADLINE> Norway 3, Sweden 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- At an imposing 6 feet, Ann Kristin  
Aarones was the tallest woman on the field by several inches. And 
when she jumped, the Norwegian midfielder towered over Sweden's 
defenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Aarones used every inch of that advantage, leaping to head in a  
goal off a free kick early in the second half and starting 
defending champion Norway to a 3-1 victory over Sweden in the 
Women's World Cup quarterfinals Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway, which has been a finalist in each of the first two World  
Cups, will face China in a semifinal match Sunday at Foxboro, Mass. 
China won its quarterfinal 2-0 Wednesday night over Russia, 
outshooting the Russians 24-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Norwegians and Swedes, neighbors and frequent opponents in  
women's soccer, played a scoreless first half befitting a game 
between familiar rivals. Aarones' goal began a Norwegian domination 
of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	As the heat of a sultry afternoon gave way to a salmon-colored  
sky and a cool breeze, Silje Jorgensen sent a free kick high into 
the Swedish penalty area. Aarones leaped for the ball and got it 
with the right side of her forehead, sending a shot skipping past 
Swedish goalie Ulrika Karlsson in the 51st minute. 
</P>
<P>
	A bare-chested male fan wearing a Viking hat ran through the  
stands in celebration as Norwegian flags fluttered among the crowd 
of 21,411 -- about 5,000 short of capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Things quickly got worse for Karlsson and the rest of the  
Swedes. The Swedish goalie was stunned in the 55th minute after a 
collision that earned Norwegian substitute Solveig Gulbrandsen a 
yellow card. 
</P>
<P>
	Three minutes later, Norway's Marianne Pettersen faked two  
defenders and lofted a soft shot that floated over Karlsson and 
landed in the corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes after that, the Norwegians were awarded a penalty  
kick when Karlsson tripped Pettersen near the net. Hege Riise 
converted the penalty, making it 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swedes avoided a shutout when Malin Mostrom scored in injury  
time at the end of the second half.

<HEADLINE> Becker Bids Wimbledon Adieu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Boris Becker bowed to the Royal Box.  
He raised his arms to acknowledge a standing ovation. He signed a 
few autographs, shook hands with referee Alan Mills, then ducked 
through the green door into the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	For the last time.  
</P>
<P>
	Becker said farewell to Wimbledon on Wednesday -- and, this time,  
for good. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, after a loss to Pete Sampras, Becker announced he  
had made his final appearance at the All England Club. 
</P>
<P>
	But he changed his mind and came back this year for one last  
hurrah. Becker surprised even himself by charging into the final 
16, but he was no match for Australia's second-seeded Patrick 
Rafter on Wednesday, losing 6-3, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Was this the final goodbye?  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, yes, definitely,'' the 31-year-old German said. ``Last  
time, I said 99 percent. Now I say 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Becker has been associated with Wimbledon for 16 years. He  
reached the third round in his first appearance in 1984, then 
stunned the tennis world by winning the tournament as a 17-year-old 
in 1985. He retained his title in 1986, won it again in 1989 and 
was runner-up four times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an incredible ride,'' he said. ``I've won more  
matches here than anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Becker became so fond of the grass at Wimbledon that he  
described Centre Court as his ``living room.'' The crowds loved his 
dashing style and intimidating power. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great love affair,'' Becker said. ``It was like  
nowhere else in the world. The place was always very special to me. 
It made who I am today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Becker overcame Britain's Miles Maclagan in the first round  
after saving three match points, then punished young German 
pretender Nicolas Kiefer in straight sets and dominated Australian 
teen-age star Lleyton Hewitt, also in straight sets. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Rafter, however, Becker looked out of his league. His  
biggest weapon -- the serve -- let him down. He had 13 double faults, 
and his first serve percentage was below 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter broke Becker eight times, including in the final game of  
the match when Becker hit a low backhand volley wide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I left my serve at home,'' he said. ``I had not timing on my  
serve at all. Every time I served, it was a struggle. It was very 
unfortunate I was not able to give him and the crowd a better match 
for my last match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter said he knew what the occasion meant to Becker but didn't  
let it affect his game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does have a presence out there but his game wasn't really  
firing today and I felt like I couldn't hit the ball much better 
either,'' he said. ``So it wasn't a good combination for him to 
leave on. ... But I don't feel bad for beating him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Becker said he had no regrets about coming back.  
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe the way I have been playing the last 10  
days here,'' he said. ``I didn't expect at all to be in the round 
of 16 playing Pat Rafter. But he outplayed me. He was a class 
better. I'm thankful I had a chance to come back and play decent 
tennis. Now it's time to do something else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Becker and his wife, Barbara, are expecting their second child  
this summer. They have a 5-year-old son, Noah Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker said he will remain involved in tennis in coaching,  
including as captain of Germany's Davis Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he will miss most about Wimbledon, Becker didn't  
hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to compare any other feeling than going on Centre  
Court, especially if it's in a final,'' he said. ``It's an 
experience where all the players will agree with me. It's one of a 
kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is one thing, though, that Becker wishes he could change.  
</P>
<P>
	``What really bugs me all along is losing four finals,'' he  
said. ``That's four too many. If you're in the final seven times 
and only come out three times as a winner, that's not a good 
percentage.''

<HEADLINE> Sports Pushing Minority Hiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Representatives of the major professional  
sports leagues said Wednesday they have enjoyed some success in 
diversifying their product but still need to do more to include 
minorities on the playing field and in owner boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball is not where we want it to be,'' said Robert Du Puy,  
vice president of operations for Major League Baseball. ``But we 
are making serious sustained efforts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Du Puy told the opening session of a two-day conference on  
minority participation in sports, sponsored by the Rev. Jesse L. 
Jackson's Rainbow-Push organization, that minority investors in 
major league franchises have increased from six in 1994 to 23 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that baseball commissioner Bud Selig also requires  
teams to notify him when a top-level position is open to ensure 
that minority candidates are given a chance at the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Du Puy said baseball executives have become much more sensitive  
to minority outreach because ``its good and necessary for the 
ongoing health of our business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant McBride, vice president for business development for the  
NHL, said players in his sport represent 20 countries but added 
``there is a piece missing.'' Less than 3 percent of pro hockey 
players are black, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McBride said the league is now distributing equipment and  
building rinks in black communities ``to gain greater interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson convened the conference to illustrate that, while blacks  
and Hispanics often excel on the field, they are underrepresented 
in administration, coaching and ownership positions in all major 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
	In professional football, 66 percent of players are black but  
all team majority owners, team presidents and CEOs are white, 
according to a fact sheet distributed by conference organizers. 
Seventy-seven percent of basketball players are black, but there 
are only three black general managers. 
</P>
<P>
	And blacks and Latinos make up 40 percent of players in baseball  
while 97 percent of owners are white. 
</P>
<P>
	``We too often have been stopping at the entertainment level of  
sport,'' Jackson said. ``We must shift from entertainment to 
empowerment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conference also is examining less-discussed aspects of  
sports, such as the diversity of media covering it. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, among the 1,600 daily newspapers in the country,  
only 15 have black sports columnists and just three have black 
sports editors, Rainbow-Push officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference is being organized by Rainbow Sports, a division  
of Jackson's Rainbow-Push Wall Street Project, which is working 
with the sports industry to develop specific standards and 
practices for greater diversity.

<HEADLINE> What Interest Rate Hike Will Affect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Federal Reserve slightly raised short-term  
interest rates Wednesday for the first time in about two years as a 
pre-emptive strike against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	A few questions and answers about what happened and how this  
could impact consumers and the economy: 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What exactly did the Fed do?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making  
body, decided after two days of meetings to increase the federal 
funds rate, which banks charge each other on overnight loans, by a 
quarter percentage point to 5 percent. There was no change in the 
discount rate, which the Fed charges on its own loans to banks. It 
stands at 4.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	After taking this action, which had been widely expected, the  
Fed surprisingly shifted its bias from favoring higher rates to a 
neutral stance. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: When was the last time rates were raised?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Twenty-seven months ago. On March 25, 1997, the central bank  
nudged up the fed funds rate, also for the first time in two years, 
again by a quarter point, to 5.50 percent from 5.25 percent, to 
ward off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as last fall, the Fed actually had been lowering  
rates, making three quarter-point cuts in the fed funds rate and 
two quarter-point cuts in the discount rate. Central bankers had 
wanted to prevent a recession in the United States amid increased 
global economic turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: So, why did the Fed decide to raise rates now?  
</P>
<P>
	A: With many overseas economies stabilizing and the domestic  
economy growing at a brisk 4.3 percent pace for the first quarter 
and the unemployment rate at a 29-year low, the Fed has once again 
become concerned about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, increased demand for U.S. products here and  
abroad could drive up prices. Also, low unemployment, coupled with 
labor shortages reported in some regions and industries, raises the 
likelihood of wage inflation. All that could thwart the country's 
lengthy economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What is the inflation rate right now?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Inflation has remained low even as unemployment has dipped to  
4.3 percent. So far this year, the annual rate of inflation felt by 
consumers is 3.3 percent, vs. a 1.6 percent rise for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been a few signs that inflation may be resurfacing.  
The Consumer Price Index rose a sharp 0.7 percent in April, 
although the index was flat in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: How will higher interest rates affect consumers?  
</P>
<P>
	A: It will make it a bit more expensive for banks to borrow  
money, and they in turn, are likely to pass on those higher costs 
to customers by raising rates on business and consumer loans. After 
the Fed acted, Bank of America said it would raise its prime rate 
to 8 percent from 7.75 percent, effective Thursday. Other leading 
banks quickly followed that move. 
</P>
<P>
	Many consumer loans are tied to banks' prime rate or even  
directly to the fed funds rate. Some consumer loans that may be 
impacted: variable-rate mortgages, credit cards, auto and 
home-equity lines of credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Fixed-rate mortgages shouldn't be affected. They're tied to  
longer-term Treasury bonds, whose yields had been rising over the 
last several weeks anyway due to fears of higher inflation and 
concerns that the Fed might tighten its monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Savers, though, could benefit. An increase in rates may mean  
more interest earned on bank products such as certificates of 
deposit and savings accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: How will higher rates affect the economy?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Higher rates mean stiffer borrowing terms for businesses.  
That could discourage some businesses from increasing capital 
spending, which could affect job growth, dampen consumer confidence 
and spending levels. But because the Fed also signaled it is not 
preparing further rate increases in the short-term, the prospects 
for steady, noninflationary economic growth may be enhanced. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Fed's decision was announced, the Conference Board  
reported its Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose in May and 
signaled continued economic growth into early 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What's next?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The Fed appeared to close the door on another rate hike when  
the FOMC meets on Aug. 24 by dropping its bias in favor of higher 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Owing to the uncertain resolution of the balance of  
conflicting forces in the economy going forward, the FOMC has 
chosen to adopt a directive that includes no predilection about 
near-term policy action,'' the panel said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it said it must remain ``especially alert to the  
emergence, or potential emergence, of inflationary forces.''

<HEADLINE> NBA, News Shows Top TV Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA championship and news shows accounted  
for 12 of the top 20 shows on television last week, but the 
basketball series had its lowest ratings in 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the five games between the San Antonio Spurs and New  
York Knicks were the highest-rated shows of the week, Nielsen Media 
Research said Tuesday. But the overall ratings were 40 percent 
below last year's finals with Michael Jordan's swan song. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC and CBS each had three of the top-rated newsmagazines  
</P>
<P>
	NBC won the week with a 7.2 rating and 14 share. CBS had a 6.9  
rating and 13 share, ABC had a 5.7 rating and 11 share and Fox was 
at 4.2 and 8. Among the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.3 rating 
and 4 share, UPN had a 1.4 rating and 3 share, and Pax TV was at 
0.8 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the domination of reruns, the week's ratings proved  
viewers won't be drawn to something just because it's new. ABC's 
Saturday game show, ``The Big Moment,'' was the lowest-rated 
program on any of the big four networks. UPN's premiere of a 
Canadian series, ``Power Play,'' also fell flat: It was the 
network's lowest-rated program last week. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news competition with a  
6.6 rating and 16 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 6.5 
rating and 15 share, while the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 5.8 and 
14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of June 21-27, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: ``NBA Finals, Game 3: San Antonio at New York,'' NBC, 
12.1; ``NBA Finals, Game 4: San Antonio at New York,'' NBC, 12.0; 
``NBA Finals, Game 5: San Antonio at New York,'' NBC, 11.0; 
``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 9.5; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 9.2; 
``Frasier,'' NBC, 9.0; ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 8.9; 
``Friends,'' NBC, 8.9; ``CBS Wednesday Movie: Now and Then,'' CBS, 
8.8; ``20/20-Sunday,'' ABC, 8.5.

<HEADLINE> Silver Plastic's Farming Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARLIER, Calif. (AP) -- Walking along a small plot of tomatoes at  
University of California Kearney Agricultural Center, it is easy to 
spot which ones were planted in a silver-colored plastic mulch 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Those tomato bushes are noticeably bigger and have more green  
fruits hanging on the vines than those planted on bare soil. 
</P>
<P>
	The plastic mulch system is nothing fancy -- a long plastic sheet  
that covers the rows where the tomatoes are planted. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of using plastic to cover the ground has been around  
for a while. What's new is using silver-colored plastic that 
reflects sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
	In areas where temperatures dip very low, growers have used  
black plastic mulch to keep the soil warm during the night. The 
mulch also helps prevent soil erosion while keeping the ground 
moist longer with less water evaporating during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The silver-colored reflective plastic mulch helps the crops and  
the soil in similar ways, but adds another one-two punch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Silver mulch increases more light to the plant canopy,'' said  
Jim Stapleton, an integrated pest management plant pathologist at 
the university. ``That basically translates into more 
photosynthesis and increased growth of the plant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plastic also reflects ultraviolet light, which repels  
insects like the aphids that carry devastating diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the insects can't land, they can't transmit diseases,''  
said university entomologist Charlie Summers. ``Many of these 
diseases are transmitted in seconds. That's why a lot of 
insecticides don't work against them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although further tests are scheduled, the preliminary results  
from other vegetables are promising. 
</P>
<P>
	With pumpkins, the researchers found virtually no silverleaf  
whitefly infestation on a plot with the reflective plastic after a 
week of planting. On bare ground, nearly 40 percent of the crop was 
infected in the same period. After three weeks, less than one 
percent was infected in the reflective system, while nearly 70 
percent was infected on crops planted in the bare ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar results were found with cucumbers, zucchinis, squash,  
cantaloupes, eggplants, broccoli, and sweet corn. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking into consideration the decrease in the amount of crops  
lost through diseases and the increase in production due to better 
photosynthesis, the researchers found yields in cucumbers went up 
10 fold: six pounds per plot vs. 60 pounds per plot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It works real good. I'm not sure why more people don't do  
it,'' said Mike Satterstrom, a pumpkin farmer who agreed to 
participate in the research two years ago. ``What we've seen is 
that the leaf of the plant gets 50 percent to 60 percent bigger. 
The leaves are stronger ... increasing the vitality of the plant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Satterstrom, 49, has seen his yields rise by more than 50  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's partly because you don't have the bug problem anymore,''  
Satterstrom said. ``We don't use much in the way of pesticides 
anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are several other growers around the San Joaquin Valley  
who are using the reflective plastic and their number is growing, 
said Andy Cabrera, manager of Specialty Ag Equipment, which sells 
the plastic in 2,000-foot rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-year-old company in its first year sold about 3,000 rolls.  
Demand has risen since then, with more than 300,000 rolls sold a 
year in the United States, Spain and Chile.

<HEADLINE> Fleury Talks With Colorado Hit Snag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The prospect of Theo Fleury staying with the  
Colorado Avalanche dimmed with the announcement that salary talks 
have not even started because of the right wing's insistence on a 
no-trade clause. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want a no-trade contract, regardless of the content of  
that agreement,'' general manager Pierre Lacroix said Tuesday. 
``We're not going to hurt the chemistry of this club for one 
contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barring a major surprise, Fleury will become an unrestricted  
free agent Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacroix conceded that uncertainty about the team's ownership is  
``a very delicate situation.'' But he said that did not rule out 
the possibility of making Fleury a significant offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ascent Entertainment has reopened bids on the Avalanche, Denver  
Nuggets and the new Pepsi Center after shareholders sued to block a 
$400 million sale to Bill Laurie and his wife, Nancy, an heiress to 
the Wal-Mart fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche acquired Fleury in March from the Calgary Flames,  
the only other team he has played for. The 30-year-old Fleury 
became the Flames' career scoring leader this year, with 364 goals 
and 466 assists in 791 games. 
</P>
<P>
	His acquisition was seen as a boost to Colorado's playoff  
chances three years after its Stanley Cup title. The Avalanche made 
it to the Western Conference finals, losing to eventual champion 
Dallas in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacroix said he talked to Fleury's agent, Don Baizley, over the  
weekend and again on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty clear they've elected to see the open market and  
what's available,'' Lacroix said. ``We understand their position. 
We respect that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury, the best player available in a thin free-agent group, is  
expected to attract several suitors, including the New York 
Rangers, who are reportedly ready with an offer in the five-year, 
$40 million range. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's other major unrestricted free agents, left wing  
Valeri Kamensky and defenseman Sylvain Lefebvre, also appear 
destined to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacroix said Kamensky's agent told him his client wants to test  
free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacroix said the Avalanche did not try to re-sign Lefebvre in  
part because of upcoming prospects, such as 1998 No. 1 pick Martin 
Skoula.

<HEADLINE> How Would Medicare Benefits Work? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senior citizens likely would pay less for  
prescriptions because of Medicare's bulk purchasing power under 
President Clinton's proposal to extend drug coverage to the elderly 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has yet to fill in some details. White House  
officials said, however, that under Clinton's plan, announced 
Tuesday, the government would contract with the same type of 
private pharmaceutical benefit management companies that many 
commercial insurers use to negotiate discounts with drugmakers for 
their bulk purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	The management companies also administer health plans' drug  
benefits, usually giving consumers prescription cards that can be 
presented for discounts at pharmacies and often also offering 
alternative prescription-by-mail services. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug companies have raised fears that a single purchaser as  
large as Medicare -- which serves 39 million elderly and disabled 
Americans -- would have such market leverage that it would have the 
effect of imposing national drug-price controls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any plan which begins the process of imposing direct, or even  
indirect, government control over drug prices eventually will slow 
the pace of medical research,'' warned Carl B. Feldbaum, president 
of the Biotechnology Industry Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said Medicare would attempt to avoid  
distorting the marketplace by using private benefit managers to 
negotiate drug discounts only on a regional and local basis, rather 
than nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is simply at the local and regional level allowing the  
Medicare program to get the same discounts for their beneficiaries 
that every other insurance provider can,'' said Clinton's chief 
economic adviser, Gene Sperling. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the administration estimates that negotiated  
discounts could save Medicare beneficiaries 10 percent to 15 
percent on their drug costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Many private health plans also save money by limiting the types  
of drugs consumers can get -- requiring the use of generics whenever 
possible, for example -- or restricting access to some particularly 
expensive and popular drugs, such as the impotency pill Viagra. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans lawmakers have raised concerns that the government  
might have too much say over what drugs retirees can get under 
Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will the government decide what drugs seniors can use and  
which ones they cannot?'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., asked in a joint 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials have offered reassurances.  
</P>
<P>
	``We would require that every therapeutic class (of drug) be  
covered,'' said Sperling. 
</P>
<P>
	Participation in the Medicare drug benefit would be optional.  
People who felt they could get a better deal from a private 
insurance policy or retiree health benefits from a former employer 
could forgo it. Clinton is pledging financial incentives to 
encourage employers to keep offering drug benefits to their 
retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	But administration officials estimated that 31 million people  
would opt for the Medicare plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The new benefit would be available starting in 2002 for a  
monthly premium charge of $24. No deductible would be required, and 
Medicare would pay half of all prescription costs up to a total of 
$2,000 a year, for a maximum government subsidy of $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug premium would rise gradually to $44 a month in 2008.  
The maximum subsidy also would increase, to $2,500 a year.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Duke's record-tying team of 1999 made history  
one more time Wednesday night when four players from the NCAA 
tournament runnerup were selected in the first round of the NBA 
draft.

<P>
	Elton Brand, Trajan Langdon, Corey Maggette and William Avery  
were selected in the first 14 picks of the draft, the first time 
four players from the same school have been selected in the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago chose the 6-foot-8 Brand as the first overall pick,  
adding to the Bulls' rebuilding efforts in the post-Michael Jordan 
era. 
</P>
<P>
	As a sophomore, Brand averaged 16.2 points and 9.8 rebounds to  
lead the Blue Devils to a 19-0 Atlantic Coast Conference record and 
an appearance in the NCAA championship game. The Blue Devils also 
tied a school and national record by winning 37 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a lot of pressure, especially being the No. 1  
pick,'' said Brand, who left Duke with two years' eligibility 
remaining. ``I've just got to face it like I've faced it at every 
level. I'm going to work hard and do my best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Langdon was perhaps the surprise pick among four Blue Devils,  
picked by Cleveland as the 11th pick and before Maggette and Avery. 
Many draft experts believe the 6-3 guard would be picked late in 
the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Langdon, a three-time all-ACC selection, scored 1,974 points in  
his career, a 14.5 average. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Krzyzewski said before the draft that Langdon was the  
one most ready for the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	``He should be a longtime NBA player,'' Krzyzewski said. ``He's  
solid. There is very little variance in his game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski disagreed with the decision by underclassmen Maggette  
and Avery, chosen 13th and 14th respectively, to leave early for 
the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggette, a 6-6 freshman who came off the bench last season, was  
picked by Seattle and Minnesota took the sophomore Avery. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggette was later traded to Orlando along with Dale Ellis,  
Billy Owens and Don MacLean for Horace Grant and two future No. 2 
picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggette averaged 17 minutes, 10.6 points and nearly four  
rebounds a game, earning a spot on the ACC all-rookie team. Draft 
scouts considered his athletic ability an asset but said he needed 
to learn more about playing the pro game. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery was called by one NBA general manager one of the best pure  
long-distance shooters of the point guards available in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery was a second team all-conference selection last season,  
averaging nearly 15 points and five assists per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll have to learn more about running a team while he uses  
his skills,'' Krzyzewski said before the draft. ``Our team was an 
easier team to run. That will be his biggest thing he has to learn 
while still trying to hit his shot.''

<HEADLINE> Supporters Want Everglades Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of an ambitious $7.8 billion plan  
to save the beleaguered Everglades conceded Wednesday they don't 
yet have the congressional support to cover the cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore will present to Congress on Thursday the  
plan calling for the federal government and Florida each to put up 
nearly $200 million a year for 20 years to fund restoration of the 
unique ecosystem, home to endangered plants and species and the 
source of drinking water for south Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very concerned about that financing,'' Sen. Bob Graham,  
D-Fla., told a briefing Wednesday. ``What we're about to do is open 
heart surgery. We're going to go in with a knife. ... Once you 
start that process, you can't stop in the middle of it any more 
than you can stop in the middle of open heart surgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore called saving the Everglades ``a national priority'' and  
said, ``I am confident that Congress will join us in this historic 
effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``After three years of work, we now have a final plan that is  
terrific for the environment, terrific for communities, terrific 
for business, and saves a world and national treasure -- the 
Everglades,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president said he was confident that Congress would  
fully fund the project. ``I think the strength of that consensus 
will guarantee the money we need in the bill,'' Gore said on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Appropriations Committee recently slashed the  
administration's fiscal year 2000 request for Everglades funds by 
40 percent. Graham said the reduced funding was cause for 
awareness, but not panic. He said he hoped money would be added as 
the legislation moves through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham and Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., are pushing legislation  
that would allocate $150 million a year for the Everglades from 
revenue raised through offshore gas and oil exploration. However, 
senators from California, Louisiana and other oil producing states 
have competing proposals for use of the offshore revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a bipartisan effort in Congress, but it's going to  
take some heavy lifting,'' Ron Tipton of the World Wildlife Fund 
said of securing full Everglades funding. ``Right now we're in bad 
shape. We've really got to make a comeback from that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state of Florida has not indicated exactly how it plans to  
come up with its share of the restoration funds. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Allison DeFoor, appointed by Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to oversee  
Everglades policy, said Wednesday the state ``knows what the bill 
is for dinner'' and would come up with the cash when it was needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've historically put the money on the table, and there's no  
reason to believe that's going to change now,'' he said, adding he 
could not think of anyone who would oppose funding. ``It would be 
politically virtually unthinkable to take that position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already, Florida has spent $2.3 billion on restoring the ``River  
of Grass,'' while the federal government has contributed about $1.3 
billion over the past 15 years, DeFoor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The main focus of the Everglades plan is to restore much of the  
natural water flow to the area, which spans some 100 miles from 
Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay. The degradation began about 50 
years ago, when the Army Corps of Engineers carved 1,000 miles of 
canals and levees into the Everglades to help protect urban and 
farm areas from flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	That disruption in the natural flow sent polluted water in the  
Everglades, damaged animal habitats and caused an influx of exotic 
plants that have choked out the critical native sawgrass. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Everglades is the base of south Florida's $20 billion  
a year tourism industry, with Everglades National Park generating 
more than $150 million in revenue each year, said Stuart Strahl, 
vice president of the National Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we're talking about a $7.8 billion plan, we're not  
talking about something that has no return,'' he said. ``I think we 
can succeed and I think people can get the point the environment is 
the economy.''

<HEADLINE> Wheat Mixed; Corn, Soybeans Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures were mixed Wednesday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade, while corn and soybeans advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans pushed higher on forecasts for above-normal  
temperatures in the Midwest to last through the middle part of next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn crops in Iowa and Illinois, the two largest growing states,  
are particularly vulnerable to high heat and a lack of moisture 
over the next few weeks, as they enter the crucial pollination 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures moved higher on the strength in corn and soybeans,  
but some contract months were pressured by a U.S. Agriculture 
Department report that showed higher-than-expected acreage planted 
to spring wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for September delivery rose 1/2 cent to $2.64 1/4 a bushel;  
September corn rose 1 1/4 cents to $2.16 1/4 a bushel; September oats 
rose 1/2 cent to $1.15 1/4 a bushel; November soybeans rose 4 1/2 cents to 
$4.60 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Feeder cattle and pork futures fell sharply on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell .05 cent to 62.65 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell 1.42 cents to 74.55 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs fell 1.75 cents to 44.57 cents a pound; August pork bellies 
fell 2.47 cents to 36.85 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Bush Shatters Fund-Raising Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush raised more than $36 million in  
the first half of 1999, shattering political fund-raising records 
and shocking the less fortunate field of Republican rivals chasing 
the surging front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	The remarkable total, which caught Republican and Democratic  
operatives by surprise, is nearly 10 times as much as his closest 
Republican rival and twice as much as Vice President Al Gore, who 
has only one Democratic rival and the power of the White House 
political machine behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who already holds an overwhelming lead in Republican  
polls, is virtually certain to forgo federal matching money in the 
primary season, aides said Wednesday. The historic step would put 
him at a great advantage in the Republican primary season and 
potentially help him if he wins the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am humbled by the response,'' Bush said. ``I am, as you can  
imagine, amazed at the outpouring of support. This is a campaign 
that has got a wide range of people who are willing to help people 
from all around the country. I'm gratified and that's that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, appearing somewhat overwhelmed by the reports, was asked  
how he explained the record fund-raising. ``A wonderful 
personality,'' he replied. ``Seriously, that's what the pundits are 
going to have to figure out. I've got a lot of friends ... people 
are hungry for something. It's beyond expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush campaign said it had raised $28.3 million in the second  
quarter of 1999, bringing its fund-raising total for the first half 
of the year to $36,250,000. That surpasses the $32 million that 
1996 GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole raised for his entire 
campaign. Bush did it in less than four months. 
</P>
<P>
	He received contributions from more than 75,000 individuals -- 30  
percent of them in Texas -- with an average donation of $480. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the support of Bush reflects a deep desire on the part of  
many Republicans to get a candidate they think is viable and able 
to win,'' said Herbert Alexander, professor emeritus of political 
science at the University of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Bush does by raising this money is squeeze out these  
other candidates, who now will find it difficult to find 
contributors,'' Alexander said. ``Bush seems to have canvassed the 
Republican neighborhood and done very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush leads the other Republican candidates in the polls and has  
more money than the rest of the GOP field combined. The closest GOP 
rival to Bush, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, raised just $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore reported raising $18.2 million to $18.5 during the first  
half of 1999. Asked about Bush's take, he said Wednesday, ``I am 
grateful to those who have helped me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans will always do better than Democrats'' in raising  
money, he said, citing the 1996 presidential race, when Republican 
took in more money than Democrats ``but our ideas and policies had 
more support from the American people. And that will be the case 
again this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His only rival for the Democratic presidential nomination,  
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, reported raising more than 
$11.5 million, closing the gap a bit on Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of Bush's record-setting pace, Bush's political team  
plans to talk at the end of this week with the chief fund-raisers 
in every state, seeking estimates of how much they think they can 
take in during the last half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	That will be the first of several meetings in the coming days  
that will be used to determine whether Bush accepts federal funds 
to help finance his primary campaign. Bush said in California that 
he had not decided yet, but that his first six months haul ``makes 
it a lot easier decision.'' Aides, speaking on the condition of 
anonymity, said he was virtually certain to decide against taking 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Forgoing matching funds would allow Bush to ignore federal  
campaign spending limits. If he chooses that route, his campaign is 
likely to be criticized by opponents arguing that the action defies 
the spirit of campaign reform laws that date to post-Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he has never considered forgoing the matching money,  
``I support the system of campaign finance reform and I think our 
reforms should go further,'' Gore said, signaling a potential line 
of attack against Bush should they face each other in the general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes, one of Bush's GOP rivals, is not accepting federal  
funds. He spent $37.5 million of his own money on his unsuccessful 
1996 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes campaign manager Bill Dal Col said Bush should return the  
contributions he has received from political action committees and 
Washington lobbyists. Bush raised $1 million last week at a 
lobbyist-studded D.C. fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	``He clearly has a lot of support from Washington lobbyists and  
the establishment political class,'' Dal Col said. ``Let him return 
the special interest money and put the rumors of his ties to that 
community behind him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, doing without matching funds would enable Bush to  
raise and spend money in the months between clinching the 
nomination and the national political conventions. In 1996, Dole 
was up against the spending limits and could not respond while 
President Clinton spent millions of dollars on commercials 
attacking him. 
</P>
<P>
	The other Republican candidates trailed far behind Bush, Gore  
and Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain was next with $4.1 million, plus another $2 million  
transferred from his Senate campaign account. ``In the non-Bush 
regional, we're leading,'' campaign spokesman Howard Opinsky said.

<HEADLINE> Leading Economic Indicators Due </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Conference Board releases its Index of  
Leading Economic Indicators for May at 10 a.m. EDT today. In April, 
the index fell for the first time since June 1998. April's index 
was down 0.1 points to 107.1. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer confidence rose in June to its highest level in more  
than 30 years, signaling even stronger economic growth ahead, the 
Conference Board reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures were released as Federal Reserve policy-makers were  
beginning a two-day meeting in Washington, where they were widely 
expected to boost interest rates in a bid to cool off the economy 
and prevent inflation from rekindling. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgage rates already have been rising for two months, and that  
apparently has begun putting a damper on home sales. The Commerce 
Department reported today that sales of new homes fell 5.1 percent 
in May -- double what analysts had been expecting. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 888,000 units  
in May, down from an April sales pace of 936,000 units, the 
department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in the consumer confidence index to 138.4 in June from  
a revised 137.7 in May was the eighth consecutive monthly increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Franco, associate director of the Conference Board's  
Consumer Research Center, said the report indicates that ``current 
confidence levels point to even stronger economic growth next year 
than previously projected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added: ``The key ingredient is the labor market. That  
remains extremely strong, and that gives consumers confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St.  
Louis, noted that most analysts expect the Fed to raise rates at 
this week's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Historically, the Fed's job is to take the punch bowl away  
from the party,'' Thayer said. A rise in rates ``could cause 
(consumer) expectations to cool off a bit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets showed little reaction to this morning's  
figures, but stocks staged an afternoon rally as traders awaited 
the Fed's announcement Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial average 
surged 160.20 points, or by 1.5 percent, to close at 10,815.35. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator because  
consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall 
economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report released Monday, the Commerce Department said that  
consumer spending outpaced income in May, sending the nation's 
savings rate to an all-time low. 
</P>
<P>
	Such strong spending has been the major factor pushing U.S.  
economic growth. But the Fed has begun to worry that tight labor 
markets will soon increase wage pressures and lead to higher 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board said that June's reading was the highest  
since the all-time record for the index of 142.3 set in October 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
	The June figures was well above analysts' average expectations  
of a reading of 136.1 for the index. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest report from the business-financed research group also  
indicated that consumers were optimistic about the future. 
</P>
<P>
	A companion gauge indicating expectations over the next six  
months rose in June to 114.9 from a revised 111.3 in May, the 
report said. The June reading was the highest since 116.2 in June 
1998, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there was some slippage in consumers' confidence about  
business conditions. Just slightly more than 40 percent termed them 
good in June, down from 44.3 percent in May. Some 9.6 percent of 
those surveyed rated them ``bad'' in June, up from 8.3 percent the 
month before. 
</P>
<P>
	Optimism about job opportunities also weakened, with 41.8  
percent saying jobs were not so plentiful in June, up from 39.9 
percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer confidence index, started in 1967, is compiled from  
responses to questions sent to 5,000 households nationwide. The 
survey polls consumers on matters ranging from job prospects to 
buying plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The index compares results to its base year, 1985, when it stood  
at 100.

<HEADLINE> Energy East Buys Conn. Gas Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Energy East Corp. continued its Northeast  
shopping spree today with an $355 million agreement to purchase a 
second Connecticut-based natural gas provider. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement would make CTG Resources Inc. a wholly owned  
subsidiary of Energy East. CTG Resources is the parent company of 
Connecticut Natural Gas Corp., which distributes natural gas to 
about 142,000 customers, primarily in the Hartford and Greenwich 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month Energy East, the parent company of New York  
State Electric &AMP; Gas, also struck a deal to buy Central Maine Power 
for $957 million. It has another deal pending to acquire Southern 
Connecticut Gas Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``This transaction is about growth and competition,'' said Wes  
von Schack, chairman of Energy East. ``This transaction is another 
important step in our strategy to use our strong balance sheet and 
the proceeds from the sale of our generation assets to selectively 
grow our distribution in business in the Northeast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the three mergers are approved by state and federal  
regulators, Energy East will be one of the largest energy providers 
in the Northeast with 1.3 million electric customers and more than 
500,000 natural gas customers in New York, Connecticut and Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement announced today, 45 percent of CTG  
Resources' common stock will be converted into Energy East common 
stock with a value of $41 per share. The rest will be paid in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur C. Marquardt will remain as CTG Resources' chairman,  
president and chief executive.

<HEADLINE> Music Makers: Valerie Capers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The floor vibrates, the walls shake and the  
furniture moves a little to the music in Valerie Capers' home. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the lady plays jazz.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you can't feel it, it's not being played right,'' she says.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Capers ought to know. Blind since age 6, the pianist has  
felt her way through a career that has spanned the musical scale -- 
from classical cantatas to swinging jazz -- with performances 
alongside Dizzy Gillespie and Wynton Marsalis. 
</P>
<P>
	While everybody has heard of her famous performing partners, few  
outside jazz circles know of The Valerie Capers Ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet her musical mark can be heard in such standards as Mongo  
Santamaria's hit ``El Toro,'' which she composed and arranged for 
the Latin jazz king, and ``Sing About Love,'' her Christmas jazz 
cantata that played to sold-out audiences from Carnegie Hall to The 
Hague. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't blame it on anybody. I think it's just fate,'' she  
says in a recent interview at her apartment in the Bronx. 
``Sometimes you strike gold, sometimes you don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not for lack of trying. She has released four records since  
1967, performed at various jazz festivals and concert halls and 
been featured on Columbia's ``Legendary Pioneers of Jazz'' series. 
</P>
<P>
	Now at 63, Ms. Capers may have her first commercial hit.  
</P>
<P>
	She has partnered with a renowned -- and dead -- classical  
composer for her most challenging work to date: putting Richard 
Wagner's ``Der Ring der Nibelungen'' to jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is ``Wagner Takes the A Train,'' a fiery, up-tempo  
instrumental in which she cleverly combines recognizable Wagnerian 
strains with elements of jazz, resulting in a classical piece that 
plays to the soul. 
</P>
<P>
	The album by the same name -- released this month by Elysium  
Records -- includes several other Wagner-influenced compositions and 
some jazz standards, such as Thelonious Monk's meditative ``Round 
Midnight'' and Charlie Parker's bebop classic, ``Confirmation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow performers say the album reflects Ms. Caper's ability to  
successfully combine unthinkable musical elements. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a woman who hired a string section that played with a  
jazz band and a choir ... to perform `Sing About Love.' She's just 
so fluent in both disciplines,'' said violinist Maxine Roach, 
daughter of famed drummer Max Roach. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's breaking down barriers -- musically and personally,'' Ms.  
Roach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Born and reared in the Bronx, Ms. Capers began playing the piano  
``almost as soon as I could reach the keys'' under the tutelage of 
her father, a ragtime pianist whose friends included Fats Waller. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my house, there was always jazz music. First my dad and  
later my brother. It was just kind of natural thing -- to play 
music,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But it wasn't until she lost her eyesight from an untreated  
infection and began attending the New York Institute for Education 
of the Blind that she started developing her classical repertoire -- 
and her passion for Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could only play music by ear. I used to beg the music  
teacher to play the piece so I could hear how it sounded and then 
repeat it. But she knew I wanted to hear so I didn't have to study 
it,'' Ms. Capers said, breaking into a broad smile. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1960, she became the first blind graduate of the Juilliard  
School of Music. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got out of school and said, `OK, now what?''' she recalled.  
</P>
<P>
	That's when her brother, Bobby Capers, a saxophonist and flutist  
in Santamaria's Afro-Cuban band, encouraged her to pursue jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kept saying, `You're not using your imagination. Anybody  
can play that,''' Ms. Capers said. ``He also felt that we as 
African-Americans were responsible for one of the greatest art 
forms ever to come out of mankind and we had a responsibility to 
carry it on. It was kind of like an ethnic pride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She struggled at first, trying to find her jazz voice.  
</P>
<P>
	Today, sitting in the dining room of her dimly lighted  
apartment, Ms. Capers can point to the day in 1962 when she found 
it -- with the release of John Coltrane's critically acclaimed 
``Giant Steps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It changed the way people played jazz. It changed the  
structure. It changed the voice. It changed everything,'' she said. 
``I used to sit and play along with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, in 1967 she released ``Portrait in Soul'' (Atlantic  
Records), which was well-received but not a commercial success. 
Atlantic did not ask for another album and, in 1982, she put out 
``Affirmation'' under her own label, KMA Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt that this was the best work I had ever done, and I was  
just going to put it out there for people. For those who liked it, 
wonderful,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillespie was quoted as saying the album was ``sheer delight.''  
But again, it didn't sell big. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995 came ``Come on Home'' (Columbia) -- another miss.  
</P>
<P>
	Between albums, Ms. Capers worked as a professor of music at  
Bronx Community College, where she is now artist-in-residence. 
There she was able to join her classical training to her love of 
jazz, and to recruit most of the musicians who make up her 
ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, she plays with bassist John Robinson, drummer Earl  
Williams, saxophonist and flutist Alan Givens and guitarist Mark 
Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	Her latest album was seven years in the making, beginning with a  
1992 trip to Wagner's home in Bayreuth, Germany, where she sat on 
the couch on which the composer died. 
</P>
<P>
	When she left Bayreuth, she knew it was time to meld her musical  
loves. ``It's like all my work -- both as an educator and a musician 
-- have come full circle with this CD,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wagner Takes the A Train'' has been ranked in the top 10 play  
list by jazz radio stations, and Ms. Capers said that if she would 
be remembered for anything, it would probably be this music. 
</P>
<P>
	``The things I have composed will give me a crumb of  
immortality,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Bowl Championship Series Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Bowl Championship Series on Wednesday modified its  
guidelines for selecting teams, adding more computer rankings and 
toughening eligibility standards for one of the four major games. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a move seemingly aimed at the Big East, weaker  
conferences could be stripped of automatic bids if they fail to 
remain among the nation's elite during a four-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	The BCS took no action to address one of the major concerns from  
its debut season -- the exclusion of a worthy team such as Kansas 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Wildcats were relegated to a minor bowl even  
though the lost only one game -- the Big 12 championship in overtime 
-- and were ranked No. 3 in the final BCS standings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still feel the bowls, after you get past the 1-2 game, need  
to have some regional flexibility,'' said Southeastern Conference 
commissioner Roy Kramer, chairman of the BCS. ``You can't take two 
West Coast teams and play in Miami. You've got to have regional 
ties to make the bowls succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Champions from the Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, SEC, Atlantic  
Coast and Pac-10 receive automatic bids to the BCS, which also 
includes two at-large teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1-2 teams in the BCS standings are matched in a national  
title game that rotates among the Rose, Sugar, Orange and Fiesta 
bowls. The other six teams are divided by the remaining games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 title game will be held Jan. 4 at the Sugar Bowl in New  
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season -- the first for the BCS -- teams were eligible for  
at-large berths with either eight victories or by finishing no 
lower than 12th in the BCS standings. Now, teams must have nine 
regular-season wins over NCAA Division I-A opponents and at least a 
No. 12 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer said the main purpose of the stricter standards was to  
give schools more flexibility in making deals with bowls outside 
the BCS. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, we were holding up a lot of teams with eight wins  
that we didn't need to hold,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The BCS standings are determined through four factors: a  
combined ranking in The Associated Press media poll and ESPN-USA 
Today coaches poll; computer surveys; strength of schedule; and 
won-loss record. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, the BCS will again use the computer ratings of Jeff  
Sagarin, The New York Times and the Seattle Times. But it also will 
consider Richard Billingsley, Dunkel Index, Kenneth Massey, David 
Rothman and Matthews-Scripps Howard. 
</P>
<P>
	The newcomers have all been in existence at least five years,  
and some have been around for two decades, according to Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
	``One or two computer rankings were thought to have a greater  
impact than maybe they should have. That's the reason we decided to 
go with eight,'' Kramer said. ``It's always good to get a second, 
third, fourth or fifth opinion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A school's lowest ranking from the eight computer services will  
be thrown out, eliminating the possibility of a team being hurt by 
an unusual difference in one of the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning this season, each of the six BCS leagues must show it  
is worthy of that status. If a conference's automatic qualifiers 
failed to average at least a No. 12 BCS rating over a four-year 
period, it could be stripped of the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision seems most directed at the Big East, which has been  
criticized for sending subpar champions to the major bowls. Last 
season, Syracuse (8-4) finished No. 15 in the BCS rankings and was 
routed by Florida 31-10 in the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The BCS discussed a mechanism to prevent another team such as  
Kansas State from being left out, but decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the BCS is considering whether to add a fifth game  
to its lineup, providing spots for two more at-large teams. While 
Kramer described the talks as ``very preliminary,'' he didn't rule 
out another BCS game as soon as 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does have the potential to improve the system,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Kramer scoffed at complaints that the average fan can't  
comprehend the BCS and its complex formulas -- especially when more 
factors are added to the equation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is much easier to explain than a subjective poll,'' he  
said. ``You don't know why anyone voted the way they did in a 
subjective poll.''

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin To Head Gazprom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Viktor Chernomyrdin, the former Russian Prime  
Minister and President Boris Yeltsin's envoy to the Kosovo 
conflict, was elected Wednesday to chair Russia's largest company, 
natural gas monopoly Gazprom. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, whose exports alone totaled $10.4 billion last  
year, is a key source of cash for the government, accounting for 
about one fifth of all tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin, a former chief executive of Gazprom, was elected  
chairman by the company board at its annual meeting. The mostly 
ceremonial post was previously held by State Property Minister 
Farit Gazizulin. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian media predicted that Chernomyrdin, an ally of Yeltsin,  
would use the vote to push current Gazprom chief executive Rem 
Vyakhirev to the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time in five days that a Yeltsin supporter was  
installed on the board of a major Russian company. On Friday, 
presidential chief of staff Alexander Voloshin was elected chairman 
of the board at another giant, Russia's electricity monopoly 
Unified Energy Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference after the vote, Chernomyrdin and Vyakhirev  
denied any rift between them and pledged to work together. 
</P>
<P>
	``You mustn't look for a rift between us,'' Chernomyrdin said.  
``There are people willing to split Gazprom, but that won't 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government currently owns a 38-percent controlling interest  
in Gazprom. It recently sold 4 percent of Gazprom stock to 
Germany's natural gas giant Ruhrgas to raise money for its 
near-empty coffers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin, 61, was Gazprom's CEO before he joined the Russian  
Cabinet in 1992. In December of that year he became the Russian 
prime minister -- a job he held until Yeltsin abruptly fired him in 
March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin dropped from the public eye until NATO launched air  
strikes on Yugoslavia, when Yeltsin named him presidential envoy 
for the Kosovo settlement. Chernomyrdin played a key role in 
negotiating a peace deal that led to the deployment of 
international peacekeepers in the province.

<HEADLINE> Alcohol Hit Hard on 'Real World' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MTV's ``Real World'' is all about video  
voyeurism: The network sets up a house full of strangers and lets 
cameras watch their lives unfold without intruding. 
</P>
<P>
	But in its eighth -- and most popular -- season, MTV changed its  
hands-off policy to help a cast member with a drinking problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruthie, a 21-year-old Hawaiian, is sent to a 30-day rehab  
program after a series of incidents. The situation culminated in a 
fight with some of the six other cast members who shared a home in 
Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like watching a train wreck,'' said Mary-Ellis Bunim,  
executive producer and co-creator of the series, ``and we couldn't 
let that happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the ``Real World'' season premiere, housemates had to call an  
ambulance for Ruthie when she got alcohol poisoning. Tuesday's 
episode showed Ruthie kissing another female cast member, then 
claiming no memory of it the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	For ``Real World,'' MTV selects a cast and houses them for  
several months. Although cameras are ever-present, MTV has rarely 
tried to change the course of events, though a producer once took 
the car keys from someone who was about to drive drunk. 
</P>
<P>
	During one evening, to be shown later in the season, an  
apparently drunk Ruthie gets into a car with a companion, then 
switches to the driver's seat at a traffic signal. 
</P>
<P>
	They arrive home without incident, but the next morning ``Real  
World'' supervising producer Matt Kunitz tells Ruthie on camera 
that she needs to get help or risk being fired. Ruthie undergoes 
counseling but keeps drinking, and it's her fellow cast members who 
later confront her, Bunim said. 
</P>
<P>
	She completes a rehab program paid for by MTV. But Bunim,  
wanting to maintain the suspense, won't say whether it was 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
	MTV had an obligation to help Ruthie, network president Judy  
McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to do it in a way that didn't look parental or  
intrusive or too authoritative,'' she said. ``We think this is 
something that a lot of viewers can relate to and would do for a 
friend. If there's any chance to make it more public and 
acceptable, we will take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Hon, a spokesman for the National Council on Alcoholism  
and Drug Dependence, worried that MTV was exploiting someone's 
troubles to get ratings. But after watching three episodes, Hon 
applauded MTV's response. The story line, he said, may help other 
young viewers fighting alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a new topic for television,'' Hon said, ``but what  
seems to be new here is that it's actually happening to real 
people. One of the reasons that `Real World' is so successful is 
that people who watch it can see something of themselves in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bunim said exploitation charges might have been valid if MTV  
knew of Ruthie's problem ahead of time. In fact, one of the 
finalists for this year's cast appeared to have a drinking problem 
and was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	In her application, Ruthie identified herself as a ``social''  
and ``occasional'' drinker, Bunim said. One clue that Ruthie may 
have understated her drinking came almost immediately, when she 
asked another cast member if the house's refrigerator was stocked 
with booze. 
</P>
<P>
	For whatever reason -- Ruthie's troubles, the tropical setting, a  
romance among housemates or the tendency of cast members to walk 
around nude -- this season's ``Real World'' has its highest ratings 
ever.

<HEADLINE> Man Wins $5M Over Bee Stings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A man left severely brain damaged by a  
yellow-jacket sting has won a $5 million malpractice verdict 
against a doctor who told him he was not allergic to bee stings. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Topham and his wife, Cynthia, contended Dr. Gail Shapiro,  
an allergist, negligently treated Topham for a sting allergy in 
1996. A King County Superior Court jury announced the award to the 
couple on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Topham, 30, was stung by yellow jackets twice within a week in  
1992, and the second sting triggered a near-fatal reaction that 
prompted his doctor to prescribe him a self-injection device 
containing epinephrine, a sting-allergy-fighting medication. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years later, Shapiro gave Topham a skin test considered the  
most reliable way to determine whether a patient has a venom 
allergy. The skin test came back negative. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro testified she opted not to use venom immunotherapy to  
desensitize Topham to future stings. 
</P>
<P>
	Stung in July 1997, Topham went into cardiac arrest, spent two  
weeks in a coma and suffered brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tophams' lawyers argued that Shapiro was negligent because  
she should have tried to confirm the test results via a blood test. 
The jurors agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe this verdict is justice for Dan,'' Mrs. Topham said.  
``I'm hopeful that in the future, other patients will receive much 
better care than the care my husband received.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro's lawyer, Doug Hofmann, said his client would not  
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the doctor did the right thing, but this was a very  
emotionally charged case -- the saddest case I've ever seen,'' 
Hofmann said.

<HEADLINE> India Gains Control of Five Peaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DRAS, India (AP) -- India has gained control of five knife-edge  
Himalayan peaks in the fiercest fighting of a seven-week battle to 
oust separatist Islamic guerrillas, military officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian soldiers hauled the bodies of 25 dead comrades down snowy  
cliffs Wednesday as Indian officers announced their forces had 
captured a key 16,830-foot peak following a night of shelling and 
gunbattles. That battle Tuesday claimed at least 65 lives, Indian 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The peak was the last of five on a ridge leading to strategic  
Tiger Hill, which overlooks India's National Highway 1, the 
lifeline for northern Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	An Indian assault on guerrilla posts on Tiger Hill is expected  
within days. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan's religious affairs minister warned Wednesday that the  
country would use nuclear weapons if a full-scale war broke out, 
the News Network International reported. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the semiautonomous news agency, Zafar-ul Haq told  
the Senate or Upper House of Parliament that ``nuclear weapons were 
not meant to be kept on the shelf if the security of the motherland 
was threatened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although India and Pakistan both claim all of Kashmir, it has  
been divided since independence from Britain in 1947 and the focus 
of two wars between the nations, which recently tested nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	India says Pakistani troops are supporting separatist Islamic  
militants who crossed a 1972 cease-fire line in May and entrenched 
themselves on mountain peaks in Indian-held Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan's army chief seemed to acknowledge last weekend his  
troops were involved when he said there would be no ``unilateral 
withdrawal'' from the area near the front-line town of Kargil. But 
on Wednesday, a Pakistani army spokesman said his words were 
``misinterpreted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Pakistan soldiers have not crossed the Line of Control. There  
are no Pakistan soldiers in India,'' spokesman Brig. Rashid 
Quereshi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quereshi accused India of amassing an additional 100,000  
soldiers, bringing the military contingent in India-held Kashmir to 
more than 700,000 soldiers, border guards and paramilitary troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gives India a capability of doing much more than what  
they are saying they are doing,'' he said, accusing Indian soldiers 
of crossing the disputed Kashmir border 11 times in the last seven 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	India has not reported how many troops it has in Kashmir.  
</P>
<P>
	Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said his country had  
``no intention'' of crossing the cease-fire line, even though that 
would help the Indian army choke off supplies to the entrenched 
guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pakistani forces are retreating,'' Vajpayee said in the  
northern city of Lucknow. ``We will be able to clear the entire 
area of the intruders soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the fighting, some diplomatic channels were open between  
the two bitter rivals. Their military operations chiefs have been 
in touch by telephone, the Indian Foreign Ministry said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are secret talks,'' said Col. Bikram Singh, the Indian  
army spokesman in New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Niaz Naik, an emissary of Pakistan Prime Minister  
Nawaz Sharif, flew to the Indian capital unannounced and met 
Vajpayee. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's fighting was the bloodiest one-day battle for India  
since the latest conflict began in early May, with 25 Indians 
reported killed and 40 wounded. India also claimed to have killed 
at least 40 Islamic guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	Singh said 201 Indian troops have been killed, 384 wounded and  
nine are missing since fighting began. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, a Pakistani envoy, Khurshid Kasuri, told a news  
conference Wednesday that he had invited Russian leaders to mediate 
in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistani envoys have visited a number of world capitals to  
plead their country's case, and have requested mediation from 
several countries. India has flatly refused international 
mediation.

<HEADLINE> Bush Plans To Learn About Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- George W. Bush said Wednesday that he's  
``going to listen and learn'' to make sure that, if elected 
president, he'll be ready to take office by Inauguration Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was in the oil business in West Texas, then managing  
partner of the Texas Rangers baseball team before winning election 
as Texas governor in 1994. He said those experiences prepared him 
well for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in positions where I've made decisions in my life,''  
he said. ``I know how to decide things, and I also know how to 
bring people together. I don't know how I know how to do it, I just 
know how to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by a reporter what he is doing to ensure he is ready, Bush  
said: 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to listen and learn.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Just because I happen to mispronounce the name of a country  
doesn't mean that I don't understand how to lead,'' he said. Bush 
recently called Kosovars ``Kosovarians'' and Greeks ``Grecians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What matters,'' Bush said, ``is do I know how to set clear  
goals? Do I know how to lead? Do I shoot straight? And that's all I 
know to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many others appear to believe Bush is ready: At the same news  
conference, he announced his campaign has raised $36,250,000 in the 
first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, Bush attended the kickoff of Teach the  
Teachers, a new program that will allow 900 Southern California 
educators to attend seminars on how to harness technology in the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort, financed by a supermarket chain, is aimed at  
bolstering reading and math in elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he chose to highlight the program, Bush said:  
``Teachers have got to be armed with the best tools possible to 
make sure kids don't get left behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush reiterated his support for high standards for students and  
teachers. ``No student should be left behind,'' he said, noting 
that during his tenure as Texas governor tests among some 
elementary school students have risen. 
</P>
<P>
	Jillian Flynn, a kindergarten teacher, said she was impressed by  
Bush's emphasis on standards. ``We need to keep standards high and 
have high expectations because kids will achieve them, provided the 
opportunities,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's fund raising broke records, both for the second quarter  
and for the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hollywood, the heart of President Clinton's fund-raising  
base. Bush picked up $2 million at a dinner Tuesday night, just 
hours after he said that the entertainment industry was partly to 
blame for youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush met privately with Hollywood executives, producers and  
actors earlier in the day, telling them: ``My job is to appeal to 
people from all parts of society, to call on all of us to do our 
part to usher in the responsibility era.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Wednesday's news conference, Bush never mentioned his primary  
opponents. He expressed cautious optimism that he could carry 
California in the general election, despite Republicans' 
devastating losses here last November. California carries more 
electoral votes than any other state. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans blame GOP Gov. Pete Wilson, who left office in  
January, for hurting his party with divisive fights over 
immigration and affirmative action. But Bush dismissed reporter's 
question about whether he would distance himself from Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a friend, he's an ally,'' Bush said. ``I hope he helps me  
get elected. I like him, he's a good guy. He made decisions as he 
saw fit here in the state of California.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also rejected a suggestion that his views on such issues as  
gun control are more conservative than those held by voters in the 
nation's largest state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe the state is not quite as liberal as you think,'' Bush  
said. ``This is a state that Ronald Reagan built a great political 
machine in.''

<HEADLINE> Vince Neil Loses Legal Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Motley Crue singer Vince Neil lost his bid to  
reinstate a lawsuit against a lawyer for allegedly botching his 
bankruptcy case. 
</P>
<P>
	``This motion is utterly without merit,'' Superior Court Judge  
Alan Buckner told the rocker's current attorney, David Cordrey, on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil claimed attorney Joseph Eisenberg failed to advise him  
``honestly and appropriately'' during his personal bankruptcy case 
and it cost him ``a large amount of money in settlement.''

<HEADLINE> Gymboree Jeans for Kids Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURLINGAME, Calif. (AP) -- About 7,000 pairs of jeans for boys  
were voluntarily recalled Wednesday because the waist snap comes 
off and poses a possible choking hazard. 
</P>
<P>
	The jeans were sold by the children's clothing store Gymboree  
between March and June of this year, the U.S. Consumer Product 
Safety Commission said. The jeans sold for about $19 each and had a 
blue label that reads ``GYMSPORT'' and ``Made in Mexico.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no injuries reported as a result of the jeans,  
but the Commission has received one case of the snap coming off. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers should return the jeans to a Gymboree store for a full  
refund. For more information, consumers can contact the Gymboree 
company.

<HEADLINE> Wimbledon Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Jim Courier knows a good quote when he  
delivers one. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 4 1/2-hour fourth-round match that stretched over two days, he  
lost to Tim Henman 4-6, 7-5, 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 9-7 at Wimbledon. Then 
Courier said the rain delay helped him more than Henman, who is 
trying to become the first British man in 63 years to win Wimbledon 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like an alien abduction out there, someone invaded his  
body and turned him into the greatest volleyer in the universe,'' 
he said. ``And today he came back to earth a little bit, which was 
nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Courier then cracked a smile and addressed British tabloid  
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Feel free to use that one, guys. That's fine. When I get on  
the Concorde tomorrow morning, I'll pick up the tabloids and see -- 
`Tim, Alien Abduction.' `` 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HINGIS ON HOLIDAY:* Martina Hingis promised to take a break  
after being upset in the first round by 16-year-old Jelena Dokic. 
She didn't waste any time. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven photographs of Hingis on a beach in Cyprus -- hugging and  
walking with her boyfriend -- were splashed across the front page of 
The Daily Mail on Wednesday under the headline: ``Who Needs Tennis 
?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Mail wrote, ``As her rivals squelched around the soggy  
courts at the All England Club, Martina Hingis was having the time 
of her life with her boyfriend, fellow Swiss tennis player Ivo 
Heuberger.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CEDRIC AGAIN:* Cedric Pioline, the Wimbledon runner-up two  
years ago, is back into the quarterfinals and relishing a match 
with British hero Tim Henman after beating Karol Kucera Wednesday 
6-4, 5-7, 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	``I prefer playing Henman (rather than Jim Courier) because it's  
Wimbledon, it's a bigger match -- and I prefer to play a bigger 
match,'' the Frenchman said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BYE, BYE GREG:* Canadian-born Briton Greg Rusedski, ousted in  
the fourth round by Mark Philippoussis 2-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3, 6-1, 
says the big-serving Australian has a shot at beating Pete Sampras 
in the quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he (Philippoussis) has to cut down on the double  
faults,'' said the No. 9-seeded player. ``He's beaten (Sampras) 
before ... so that will be Sampras' first major test, and 
Philippoussis will be tested as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philippoussis said he believes he can do it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've just got a lot of self-belief at the moment and sort of  
realized there is no reason why I can't go all the way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras is 6-2 against Philippoussis and has beaten the  
Australian in their two matches on grass. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STEFFI VS. VENUS:* Seven-time Wimbledon champion Steffi Graf  
admitted she would have preferred Anna Kournikova -- and not Venus 
Williams -- in the quarters. Williams beat Kournikova 3-6, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's better to play Anna,'' she said. ``You're able to  
play. You know, with Venus, if she serves well, it's very 
difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf and Williams have split four matches but they've never  
played on grass. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MARTIN OUSTS GORAN:* Last year's runner-up Goran Ivanisevic  
went out Wednesday 7-6 (7-3), 6-3, 6-4 against American Todd 
Martin, who got past the fourth round for the fourth time at 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Martin) is not the fastest player on the tour, but he's  
playing very smart tennis,'' Ivanisevic said. ``I just played a bad 
match today and that's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Largely overlooked like American woman Lindsay Davenport, Martin  
is playing his best tennis in ages. ``I think the last nine, eight 
months has been the best I've ever played in a sustained period of 
time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at those players who are still around in this  
tournament, I think I'm probably the least noted, and that's fine 
with me. I'd just as soon keep a low profile and go about my 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HEAD-TO-HEAD:* Here's how the quarterfinals shape up with  
head-to-head records. 
</P>
<P>
	For the men, Pete Sampras holds a 6-2 edge on Mark  
Philippoussis; Cedric Pioline and Tim Henman are 1-1; Gustavo 
Kuerten leads Andre Agassi 2-1, but they've never played on grass; 
Martin leads Patrick Rafter 4-3 and this will be their first 
showdown on grass. 
</P>
<P>
	For the women, Jelena Dokic and Alexandra Stevenson will meet  
for the first time; Lindsay Davenport holds a 5-0 edge on defending 
champion Jana Novotna, but they have never played on grass; Mirjana 
Lucic is 1-0 up on Nathalie Tauziat; Steffi Graf and Venus Williams 
are 2-2 but have yet to meet on grass.

<HEADLINE> Knoblauch Makes 15th Error </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With each error, the questions about Chuck  
Knoblauch multiply. 
</P>
<P>
	What's wrong with his throwing arm?  
</P>
<P>
	What can be done?  
</P>
<P>
	When is this streak of deficient defense going to end?  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll get it straightened out,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre  
said Wednesday after Knoblauch made his 15th error in New York's 
8-2 loss to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch, a Gold Glove winner in 1997, tied White Sox shortstop  
Mike Caruso for the second-most errors in the American League, two 
behind Chicago third baseman Greg Norton. Pittsburgh third baseman 
Ed Sprague and Los Angeles third baseman Adrian Beltre lead the NL 
with 16 each, 
</P>
<P>
	With Detroit ahead 3-1 in the fifth inning and one out, Tony hit  
a grounder to shortstop Derek Jeter, who made the toss to Knoblauch 
at second. But the relay throw was wide of first as a run scored. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch made shaky throws -- but got outs at first -- on  
grounders by Gabe Kapler in the second and Juan Encarnacion in the 
fifth. Both tosses seemed to come out of his hand softly and went 
higher in the air than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15 errors are the most by Knoblauch since he had 18 in his  
rookie season with Minnesota in 1991. While easy throws are giving 
him problems, he's making difficult plays. He saved a run in the 
second with an inning-ending throw on a hard grounder by Bobby 
Higginson that caromed off pitcher Andy Pettitte. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have nothing to say, guys,'' was Knoblauch's only  
comment after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch is drawing comparisons to Steve Sax, the second  
baseman who made 30 errors in 1983, 21 errors in '84, 22 in '85 and 
20 in '92. Torre said Knoblauch's throwing problem hasn't reached 
the level of Sax's. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have confidence in him,'' Torre said. ``You talk about it  
too much and it could turn into a chronic problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Torre's has discussed it with Knoblauch.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something you totally ignore,'' Torre said. ``We all  
want to get this thing fixed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch has come out of an offensive slump, raising his  
average from ,248 to .267 with 15 hits in his last 40 at-bats 
(.375). He has a reputation for being hard on himself and for 
stubbornness. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't allow much, but he does sit and listen, is very  
respectful,'' Torre said.

<HEADLINE> Suspense Grips NBA Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the first pick in the NBA draft, some  
team will select somebody. 
</P>
<P>
	Will it be Chicago picking Lamar Odom? Miami picking Odom?  
</P>
<P>
	And what about that second pick? Will Vancouver select Elton  
Brand? Will the Grizzlies trade it so that someone else can get 
Steve Francis? 
</P>
<P>
	Those were only a few of the endless number of questions being  
tossed around in the hours approaching tonight's draft at the MCI 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nerve-racking,'' Francis said. ``It's the last day, and  
you hear so many rumors and so much that's going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the intrigue surrounding the top choice was swirling  
around Chicago Bulls general manager Jerry Krause, who owns the No. 
1 selection and has been actively shopping it around the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver also has been shopping the No. 2 pick.  
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry hasn't made it tough on us. He has a reputation of being  
somewhat secretive,'' Vancouver assistant general manager Noah 
Croom said. ``I don't think we have played our hand any more than 
he has. We will do what we have to do regardless of whether Jerry 
Krause or anyone else has the first pick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just when it seemed the field was narrowed to Francis or Brand  
as the top overall pick, Odom said Tuesday it was his gut feeling 
he'd be picked No. 1 by Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Wally Szczerbiak of Miami of Ohio and UCLA guard Baron Davis are  
expected to round out the top five. 
</P>
<P>
	Around the league, the talk was that the Miami Heat were trying  
to move up to get Odom, while the Lakers and Rockets were 
discussing a trade that would send Scottie Pippen to Los Angeles 
for Glen Rice and Robert Horry. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta and Golden State made a deal, the Hawks sending Mookie  
Blaylock and the No. 21 pick to the Warriors for Bimbo Coles, Duane 
Ferrell and the 10th overall pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The order of selection at the top of the draft -- the first five  
being Chicago, Vancouver, Charlotte, the Los Angeles Clippers and 
Toronto -- figured to change in some way by time the draft begins. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a mystery to me, just like every other player is really  
wondering where they're going,'' Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Krause has been talking to numerous teams to explore dozens of  
trade options, and many people around the league expected him to 
deal the No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a very good possibility that we will not make any  
decision on the draft choice until Wednesday afternoon,'' said 
Krause, who is trying to rebuild the Bulls following the breakup of 
the team that won three straight titles from 1996-98. ``We don't 
feel there's an advantage to us to making it sooner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said coach Tim Floyd: ``If somebody knocks Jerry out with a  
trade, then I'm sure we'll have to look at it and go that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Statements like those were the reason why all the top players  
had a greater air of uncertainty about them than usual on the day 
before the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the comments were downright bold: Brand sounding eager  
to play for Vancouver; Szczerbiak saying he would love to play for 
the Clippers; Odom saying he spoke to Krause several times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chicago's in more of a rebuilding stage,'' said Brand, the  
college player of the year, ``They don't have superstar-level 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vancouver has Mike Bibby at the point, Felipe Lopez had a  
stellar year, I think surprised some people. Then you've got 
Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Big Country (Bryant Reeves) down low. I 
think I could fit in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, who left Duke after his sophomore season, is a 6-foot-8  
forward who played center in college and averaged 17.7 points and 
9.8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis, a 6-3 guard, averaged 17.0 points for Maryland and  
skipped his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a 6-2 point guard from UCLA, figures to be chosen no  
lower than fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak, a 6-7 forward, should be chosen no lower than fifth.  
</P>
<P>
	Aside from Krause's maneuverings, another big draft uncertainty  
was Odom. 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-10 phenom from Rhode Island who could play three positions  
in the pros, Odom might have hurt his stock by declaring for the 
draft, then trying to pull out. He then missed several workouts 
scheduled by NBA teams. 
</P>
<P>
	He was not on time for Tuesday's media availability session held  
by the NBA. On Monday, he worked out in Providence for the Bulls, 
Raptors, Clippers and Timberwolves. Odom also held an earlier 
workout in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	``For teams out there, there's nothing to be scared of,'' Odom  
said. ``I'm not a cancer. I'm a great kid, a little 
misunderstood..'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the top 10 draft slots are Minnesota, Washington,  
Cleveland, Phoenix and Atlanta, who will likely be choosing among 
Jonathan Bender of Picayune High School in Mississippi, guards 
Jason Terry of Arizona, Richard Hamilton of Connecticut, Andre 
Miller of Utah and William Avery of Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Lottery teams Cleveland, Toronto and Seattle will choose 11th,  
12th and 13th. After its trade with Golden State, Atlanta still has 
three picks (Nos. 10, 20 and 27), as does Utah (19, 24 and 28). 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen a draft where more people in the late first  
round were willing to deal their first-round picks,'' Wizards 
general manager Wes Unseld said. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the Rockets, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, confirmed to The Associated Press that the Lakers 
approached Houston on Tuesday with the offer of Rice and Horry, a 
trade that would reunite Pippen with coach Phil Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen struggled in his first season with the Rockets and their  
stagnant offense, while Rice never really fit in with the Lakers 
after they acquired him at midseason for Eddie Jones and Elden 
Campbell. The trade would seem to be a fit for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to Houston whether to do it or not,'' the source said.  
</P>
<P>
	Chicago (Nos. 1 and 16), Toronto (5 and 12), Cleveland (8 and  
11) and Minnesota (6 and 14) have two picks apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas, New Jersey, Sacramento, Milwaukee, Philadelphia,  
Detroit, Orlando and Portland do not have first-round picks.

<HEADLINE> The Last To Arrive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Devean George's story is a reminder why mothers will never stop  
nagging kids to clean their plates. 
</P>
<P>
	While he would not be the longest shot ever to be chosen in the  
first round of the NBA draft, he would definitely be one of the 
last to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk about a late bloomer; as recently as two years ago, almost  
nobody outside of Minneapolis had heard of him. But on the day of 
the draft, there's not a general manager in the league with a pick 
from the middle of the first round to the end that hasn't worried 
about how to explain to the boss the reason George slipped through 
his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	They will blame it on his playing ball in Division III. The last  
player to make the leap from there to the big time was Lamont 
Strothers, who washed out after little more than a season in the 
NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The only D-3 player to vault all the way to the first round was  
Terry Porter, who went from Wisconsin-Stevens Point to Portland 
with the last pick of the round in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be real curious to see where Devean winds up,'' said  
Phoenix Suns player personnel director Dick Van Arsdale, whose team 
selects ninth. ``Of course, I wouldn't even be talking to you about 
him if our pick was a few places lower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When George graduated from St. Margaret High in 1995, he was a  
5-foot-10 point guard who could shoot the 3 and dunk, but couldn't 
get the attention of a single Division I program. Two years later, 
George was a muscular 6-7, 220-pound small forward at a smaller 
college that could do all those things and more -- with authority. 
</P>
<P>
	From the end of his freshman year to the end of his sophomore  
year, he grew five inches without losing an eyelash worth of 
coordination. That's when the low-level buzz began. 
</P>
<P>
	What followed were two All-America seasons of high-flying at  
tiny Augsburg College -- but well below the radar of ESPN's 
SportsCenter -- and a spectacular showing at an NBA tryout camp that 
he wasn't even supposed to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the one and only break George didn't make for himself.  
Iowa's Jess Settles pulled out of the Portsmouth (Va.) 
Invitational, the first of three NBA predraft camps, and George 
filled in more than admirably. He averaged a double-double in 
points and rebounds while helping his team win a championship, and 
made the all-tournament team. Over the course of the games, a dozen 
agents slipped business cards under his hotel-room door. 
</P>
<P>
	He settled on little-known Dan Green, and they mapped out a  
whirlwind tour across the country that had George auditioning in 
the gym for every one of the 11 clubs that sent him an airline 
ticket. He reluctantly canceled visits to Orlando, Philadelphia and 
another predraft camp in Chicago when his ankle gave out midway 
through the tour, but George had no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I quit thinking about the NBA by the end of high school,''  
George said from his Los Angeles hotel room Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	This was just before a morning workout with the Lakers and an  
afternoon flight to New Jersey. ``Back then, all I was thinking 
about was getting a marketing degree and a good job. So I can't 
tell you,'' he added, ``how much that means to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But his agent can.  
</P>
<P>
	Even with the rookie salary cap in place, a mid- to late  
first-round choice gets a guaranteed contract worth between $1.8 
million and $2.4 million. That would be enough for George to pay 
off his loans at Augsburg, pay back his parents for working two 
jobs sometimes to keep him in clothes through that astonishing 
growth spurt and -- if he is so inclined -- still buy himself a 
different-colored Mercedes to drive every day of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	But that last bit would surprise most of the people who know  
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kid will never be spoiled,'' Augsburg coach Brian Ammann  
said. ``I can remember a growth spurt of four months or so where he 
had on new clothes all the time and we'd wonder if his family had 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``But then I'd found out how much he borrowed just to go to  
school, or I'd see what a kick he got when his agent gave him a few 
pairs of sneakers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out George needed every pair. He started working out  
for the Knicks on May 25 and had a workout scheduled by the Nets on 
draft-day morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will open your eyes,'' Ammann said. It was early evening,  
and he was waiting for a phone call from Lakers vice president 
Jerry West, following up on George's workout that morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll never forget the moment I realized that this was probably  
the best guy I was ever going to have. Devean could always go 
around guys, but all of a sudden, he started jumping over them. 
That's when I knew,'' Ammann said, wonder creeping into his voice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, his high school coach knew the family and told me they  
were late bloomers, but who knew?'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Serial Killer Ng Gets Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Serial killer Charles Ng was sentenced  
to death today for a mid-1980s spree of sexual torture and murder 
in rural California. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Hong Kong immigrant and former U.S. Marine was  
convicted of murdering 11 people -- six men, three women and two 
baby boys -- in 1984 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	He had spent 14 years fighting murder charges in what became one  
of the longest and costliest prosecutions in California history. 
The final cost to taxpayers was estimated at $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge John J. Ryan followed the jury's  
recommendation in imposing a death sentence. Ryan could have 
sentenced Ng instead to life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the women were imprisoned, tortured and raped  
after being lured to a cabin belonging to Leonard Lake, a friend of 
Ng's. 
</P>
<P>
	Charred human remains and the victims' belongings were found at  
the cabin in the Sierra Nevada foothills 150 miles east of San 
Francisco. Lake, a survivalist, lived there and had built a bunker 
with a prisoner's cell. He killed himself after a shoplifting 
arrest in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng was arrested later that year in Canada, where he fought  
extradition for five years. The trial was transferred to Southern 
California because of pretrial publicity. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng denied he killed anyone and said he didn't know Lake planned  
to kill, either. But jurors watched graphic videotapes in which 
Lake and Ng were seen tormenting bound women.

<HEADLINE> New York Bans Wild Animal Ownership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tasmanian devils, elephants, crocodiles and  
polar bears have been officially banned as pets in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's the ban on ferrets that is raising a ruckus.  
</P>
<P>
	The city's Department of Health on Tuesday released its official  
list of banned animals, a list that includes gila monsters, 
venomous centipedes and anaconda snakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Such animals had already been generally prohibited, but the  
city's health code had never specified them by name. 
</P>
<P>
	The clarification sparked controversy when owners of ferrets  
objected to the inclusion of their pets on the list of animals 
deemed ``wild, ferocious, fierce, dangerous or naturally inclined 
to do harm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This department is trying to malign ferrets unfairly,'' Gary  
Kaskel said. ``They are domestic, friendly, gentle, litter 
box-trainable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials expressed concern about instances in which  
ferrets have attacked and seriously injured infants. 
</P>
<P>
	``The primary public safety concern is that the ferret, despite  
any possible popularity as a household pet, remains prone to 
vicious, unpredictable attacks on humans, particularly very young 
children and infants,'' according to a health department report. 
</P>
<P>
	The city has long defined ferrets as wild animals and won a 1995  
federal court ruling upholding its policy. Outside the city, no 
other county in the state prohibits pet ferrets. Nationally, only 
California and Hawaii ban the critters.

<HEADLINE> NYC Clamping Down on Street Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Penn Jillette, professional sleight-of-hand  
artist, says it is possible to make money playing three-card monte 
-- if the dealer gets struck by an asteroid. 
</P>
<P>
	The City Council agrees, and moved this week to close a loophole  
that was opened when a judge declared that the vintage New York 
street scam is legal because it is a game of skill, not chance. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed new ordinance would make three-card monte illegal,  
putting it in a league with loaded dice and rigged roulette wheels. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a con game,'' Councilman Sheldon Leffler, head of the  
council committee on public safety, said Wednesday. ``We're 
protecting people against fraud, larcenies, being duped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As played on New York's street corners, one red card is mixed  
with two black cards. The dealer swiftly moves the cards around on 
top of a cardboard box, inviting a player to pick the red one when 
the shuffling stops. The wager is generally $20 a game. 
</P>
<P>
	In theory, the odds of winning are 1-in-3. Participants  
invariably wave goodbye to their cash, suckered by any number of 
sleight-of-hand moves. 
</P>
<P>
	Jillette, the 6-foot-6 verbal half of the comic illusionists  
Penn and Teller, used to watch Times Square's three-card monte 
masters in action. 
</P>
<P>
	Can the dealers ever lose?  
</P>
<P>
	``It is possible,'' he said, ``that the operator could be hit by  
an asteroid and your $20 could fall off his cardboard box and land 
on the ground, and while you were picking it up, $5 could blow into 
your hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``You therefore could win $5 by a simple twist of fate.''  
</P>
<P>
	And without cosmic intervention? ``Your chances of winning,''  
Jillette said, ``are absolutely zero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new proposal was prompted by an August 1995 ruling from a  
New York City judge who dismissed gambling charges against a monte 
dealer, ruling it is a game of skill. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dealer banks on his ability to manipulate the cards faster  
than the player can track the cards with his eye,'' Judge Sheryl 
Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling infuriated the people cleaning up Times Square, the  
city's unofficial home of three-card monte. 
</P>
<P>
	Leffler's committee voted Tuesday to get around the judge's  
ruling by explicitly making any public dealing of three-card monte 
illegal. The bill is expected to pass the full council next week 
and receive quick approval from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	If the measure doesn't make it, and the job market for magicians  
gets tight, Jillette figures he can always make a living in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can throw three-card monte,'' he said. ``If you take away my  
job, and put me on the streets of New York, I can make some coin.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bank To Pay $3M in Privacy Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- U.S. Bancorp agreed Wednesday to pay  
states and charities $3 million to settle allegations it illegally 
sold confidential customer information to a telemarketer. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount equals the commissions the bank earned on the sale of  
the information. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bancorp, the nation's 13th-largest bank holding company and  
parent company of U.S. Bank, did not admit any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations were contained in a lawsuit filed earlier this  
month by state Attorney General Mike Hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said about 1 million people in 17 Midwestern and Western  
states were affected by the bank's action. He began investigating 
after getting about 50 complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	After he sued U.S. Bancorp, Wells Fargo and Bank of America  
agreed to stop the practice, too. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bancorp agreed to give up the $3 million in commissions it  
earned on sales that the telemarketer made to bank customers. 
Habitat for Humanity in Minnesota, which builds houses for the 
poor, will receive $1.5 million, the state of Minnesota will get 
$500,000, and other charities and states will get $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The other states affected are California, Colorado, Iowa, Idaho,  
Illinois, Kansas, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, Nevada, Oregon, 
South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bancorp also will compensate customers who are dissatisfied  
with services they purchased from the telemarketers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bancorp chief executive Jack Grundhofer said the lawsuit  
compelled the bank to reconsider what it believes was an 
industrywide practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Since January 1996, U.S. Bank provided Member Works Inc. of  
Stamford, Conn., with names, Social Security numbers, marital 
status, occupation, account balances, homeownership status and 
credit limits, Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch contended the bank violated the federal Fair Credit  
Reporting Act and engaged in consumer fraud and deceptive 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal and state agencies require banks to publish privacy  
policies telling consumers how their personal information will be 
used, who has access to it and if the bank intends to give the 
information to others.

<HEADLINE> Padres Send Myers to Disabled List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego Padres catcher Greg Myers was placed  
on the 15-day disabled list Wednesday with a strained right 
hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers was hurt running out a double-play ball Monday night. The  
move was made retroactive to Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	To fill his roster spot, the Padres recalled right-handed  
reliever Carlos Almanzar from Triple-A Las Vegas for the third time 
this season. Manager Bruce Bochy wanted 12 pitchers on the roster 
because the Padres play four games in three days at Colorado this 
weekend, including a doubleheader on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers becomes the third Padres catcher on the DL, joining Carlos  
Hernandez, who's out for the season, and Jim Leyritz. Rookie Ben 
Davis was recalled from Las Vegas after Leyritz broke a bone in his 
left hand last week in a win at Dodger Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Report: Investors Buying Japan Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A group of investors led by U.S.-based Ripplewood  
Holdings is wrapping up negotiations for the purchase of the Long 
Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., news reports said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank and Japan's Financial Reconstruction Commission are  
expected to approve the sale as early as this month, the Nihon 
Keizai business daily reported. It quoted sources it did not 
identify. 
</P>
<P>
	LTCB is under state control. The commission is a government body  
overseeing a cleanup of the nation's banking industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripplewood has promised to buy the bank intact, retain its  
entire work force, and re-list it on the Tokyo stock market, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. investment firm would purchase LTCB for an estimated  
$830 million to $1.65 billion, the Nihon Keizai said. 
</P>
<P>
	LTCB, once one of Japan's premier banks, was nationalized last  
year after regulators determined it would never recover from a 
mountain of bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time the Japanese government had taken over a  
bank since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of LTCB's bad debt was the result of aggressive lending to  
real estate developers before property prices in Japan burst in the 
early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Ichiro Murakami, a spokesman for the bank in Tokyo, would  
acknowledge only that negotiations were under way with four of five 
companies interested in buying the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``For reasons of confidentiality, we can't say anymore than that  
right now,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the FRC declined comment on the reported buyout,  
and officials at Ripplewood could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Other parties that reportedly have expressed interest in buying  
LTCB include Chuo Trust and Banking Co. and Mitsui Trust and 
Banking Co., both of Japan, and J.P. Morgan and Co. of the United 
States, Kyodo News agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripplewood, which began a detailed examination of the bank's  
assets in mid-June, has begun selecting executives to run the bank, 
the Nihon Keizai report said.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Blocks USDA Dairy Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A plan by the Agriculture Department to end  
the government's Depression-era milk pricing program in favor of a 
new system ran into an obstacle Wednesday in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Agriculture Committee voted 32-15 in favor of a bill  
that would block Secretary Dan Glickman from implementing the 
system he proposed in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers are moving forward even though Glickman's proposal  
must win approval from dairy farmers before it could take effect 
Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's vote came after a four-hour hearing that included  
calls by some lawmakers to scrap the milk program. 
</P>
<P>
	``This backward system robs too many of our nation's dairy  
farmers of the opportunity to compete and prosper,'' said Rep. John 
Boehner, R-Ohio, who tried unsuccessfully to pass an amendment to 
phase out the system. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are the nation's milk pricing regions, which are  
divided into what are called milk marketing orders. The orders set 
the price that processors pay dairy farmers, much like a minimum 
wage. 
</P>
<P>
	The price is higher the farther a farm is from Eau Claire, Wis.,  
which was considered the center of dairy production when the 
pricing system was established, as a way to ensure all regions had 
sufficient milk supplies. The higher prices in other areas 
encourage farmers in the South, for instance, to produce milk. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the current system pits region against region -- all  
to the detriment of farmers in the Upper Midwest, where prices are 
kept the lowest. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA plan attempts to close the disparity. It would increase  
the minimum price by 11 cents in Minnesota and 15 cents in 
Wisconsin from 2000 to 2006, according to a University of Missouri 
study. The price would fall 5 cents nationwide and far more in 
other states, as much as 46 cents in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents to the USDA plan say the lowered prices would be  
disastrous for dairy farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farmers in all regions of the country ought to have the  
opportunity to make a living,'' said Rep. John Sweeney, R-N.Y. 
``This proposal ensures fair market prices for farmers and 
reasonably priced, locally produced milk for consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., said supporters of the House action  
want to ``maintain our current antiquated dairy pricing system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time our dairy pricing system is brought up to date,''  
Kohl said.

</P>
<P>
	Chavez, the leader of a failed 1992 coup attempt, reportedly  
plans to name Gen. Vasilly Kotosky Flores as head of the Technical 
Judicial Police. Since taking office in February he has appointed 
scores of soldiers to government posts, provoking criticism that he 
is militarizing the country.

	Eliseo Guzman, head of detectives at the judicial police, said a  
general would be unequipped to run the agency, which carries out 
investigations into murders, drug trafficking, theft and other 
crimes. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	Foreigners making short visits -- less than 72 hours -- to cities  
within 16 miles of the border will be exempted from the fee. Also 
excluded will be visitors in special ``tourist corridors,'' such as 
the popular towns of Ensenada, Puerto Penasco, Paquime, Santa Rosa

<HEADLINE> Wolverine Players Might Be Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Two Michigan football players and an ex-player  
were being investigated Wednesday in connection with the theft of 
several thousand dollars worth of merchandise from a Kmart store. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still in the investigation process,'' Washtenaw County  
sheriff's Lt. Brenda Sutton said. ``It's going to be up to the 
prosecutor's office to determine charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive linemen Jonathan Goodwin and Maurice Williams, both  
20, and former fullback Demetrius Smith, 19, were being 
investigated as being part of a six-person embezzlement ring, 
according to 14th District Court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation began June 23 when a loss control manager for  
Kmart contacted the sheriff's department. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kmart had their own suspicion that there was illegal  
activity,'' Sutton said. ``Company security observed this, and 
that's when they called us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three men and two women, with help from a female cashier,  
allegedly took thousands of dollars worth of merchandise through a 
checkout lane at the Kmart store in Ypsilanti Township earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The employee, Sweetana Cummings, told investigators the  
embezzlements were arranged with the other five, who posed as 
customers. Cummings said she failed to charge them for merchandise 
processed at her register, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators searched an apartment in Pittsfield Township where  
Goodwin and Williams live and recovered 52 items valued at more 
than $3,000, including telephones, furniture, video tapes and 
toilet paper. Investigators said they also expected to find more 
than $3,000 worth of merchandise at three other locations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds like the things that were taken were for personal  
use, not resale,'' Sutton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed with the reports we received today,''  
athletic director Tom Goss said. ``This is very unfortunate. We as 
a university are totally embarrassed and upset with the reports 
that were hearing. We will deal with the athletes accordingly once 
all the facts have been compiled and the investigation is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This type of attitude will not be tolerated at the University  
of Michigan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Messages were left seeking comment from Goodwin and Williams on  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a bad decision; no comment,'' Williams told the Detroit  
Free Press. Goodwin declined comment when reached by the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's mother, Diane Smith of Calumet, Ill., said he could not  
comment. But she proclaimed her son's innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demetrius has a receipt for the items,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The allegations are the latest in a string of problems for  
Michigan's football team. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith pleaded guilty on June 8 to forging a check and has been  
suspended from the team pending a resolution to the case. He is 
scheduled for sentencing July 27. 
</P>
<P>
	At least four other players have been suspended following  
fights, sexual assault convictions and marijuana possession 
charges. Another sat out six games last fall for accepting extra 
benefits in violation of NCAA rules.

	The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Fortier's sentence  
should have been based on federal guidelines for involuntarily 
manslaughter rather than the significantly higher guidelines for 
first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sentence was improper, as we argued all along,'' said  
Michael McGuire, Fortier's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	The lesser guidelines would have put Fortier's sentence at a  
maximum of 51 months, McGuire said. Fortier began serving his 
sentence in August 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Myron Marlin, a Justice Department spokesman, wouldn't comment  
until prosecutors had a chance to review the opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier, 30, pleaded guilty to having advance knowledge of the  
plot to bomb the federal building in 1995. He testified against 
McVeigh and Terry Nichols, admitting he helped McVeigh move and 
sell stolen weapons and lied to FBI agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1995 bombing killed 168 people and injured hundreds more.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued that Fortier knew the money would be used to  
finance the bomb plot. But Fortier's lawyers said McVeigh and 
Nichols did not tell him how they planned to use the money from the 
sale of stolen weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh was convicted of murder, conspiracy and weapons charges.  
He is appealing his death sentence. Nichols was convicted of 
involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy and sentenced to life. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing on Nichols' bid for a new trial is scheduled for next  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier is bitter about the government's tough stance on his  
sentence after he spent years helping prosecutors convict Nichols 
and McVeigh, McGuire said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's never been given any credit for anything he has done to  
help the government in this case,'' McGuire said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Van Bebber, who sentenced Fortier,  
ruled that Fortier faced up to 17 1/2 years before taking into account 
his cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors wanted the judge to start at 11 to 14 years and give  
him a significant reduction for his help. Defense attorneys, at the 
time of the sentencing, wanted Fortier's term to be no more than 37 
to 46 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``What makes me more upset than anything against Fortier is that  
this man was technically out of it and all he had to do was make 
one dang phone call to prevent it from happening,'' said Dan 
McKinney, whose wife, Secret Service Agent Linda McKinney, was 
killed. ``He's going to get slapped on the wrist.''

<HEADLINE> Big Ten Conference Has Tough Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Say this much for the Big Ten Conference: Six of its 11 schools  
are halfway through the week without any bad news. That's more than 
can be said for the other five. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had better weeks,'' commissioner Jim Delany said  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke as Purdue's basketball program was placed on probation  
for two years by the NCAA, the latest in a string of troubles for 
his conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue lost a scholarship and had recruiting visits limited as a  
result of major violations involving an assistant coach and two 
others close to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	This came just days after coach Clem Haskins took a $1.5 million  
buyout to leave Minnesota as the university begins to rebuild from 
an academic fraud scandal involving its basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other schools -- Michigan State, Michigan and Iowa -- have  
players in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Mateen Cleaves, an All-American basketball player for the  
Spartans, faces two noise disturbance citations on top of a 
misdemeanor charge of larceny. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves has until July 7 to answer the citations, which carry  
penalties of up to 90 days in jail and a $100 fine. That's the same 
date as his pretrial hearing on a charge of accompanying former 
Michigan State basketball player Antonio Smith in stealing a 
40-ounce can of beer from an East Lansing convenience store in 
April. He has pleaded innocent to the larceny charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Michigan football players and a former teammate could face  
felony charges for embezzlement and conspiracy to commit 
embezzlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The trio -- offensive linemen Jonathan Goodwin and Maurice  
Williams and former fullback Demetrius Smith -- and three others are 
being investigated on charges of stealing merchandise from a Kmart 
store. 
</P>
<P>
	They were described as being part of a six-person embezzlement  
ring in 14th District Court documents. Conviction on the charges 
could carry a a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa quarterback Randy Reiners was arrested for the second time  
in 18 months on an alcohol charge Tuesday morning and could be 
suspended from the team for violating school policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Reiners was found ``sleeping or passed out'' in a university  
parking lot, court records showed. He paid a $50 fine and $15 in 
court costs on the public intoxication charge Tuesday in Johnson 
County District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got 7,000 athletes, and, particularly in basketball and  
football, they are public figures,'' Delany said. ``When they make 
mistakes, it's big news. A lot of these are charges and we have to 
see how they play out,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said, athletes have a responsibility to themselves and  
their schools to stay out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some kids do things that are stupid. Sometimes they're  
intentional, sometimes they're negligent. We've got more athletes 
than any other conference. We put on 300 televised events a year 
and 7 million people come to our games. It's entertainment and it's 
commercial. We create celebrity status and sometimes they don't 
handle it well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes immature persons put themselves in situations that  
embarrass themselves, their schools and the conference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delany said the Big Ten tries to prepare its athletes for coping  
with celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do everything we can with life skills,'' he said. ``They  
have to understand they're public figures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The situations at Purdue and Minnesota have less to do with the  
athletes than they do with adults around the teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have rules to keep a level field,'' Delany said. ``When we  
don't follow those rules, we get in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had years when our teams have won with no controversies.  
Now we've had a rash of them. It's the way life is -- a little 
sporadic and chaotic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is one bright side to all this. Nobody's mentioned the  
Northwestern point-shaving scandal lately.

<HEADLINE> Virginia Trash Restrictions Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A federal judge has blocked enforcement of  
new state laws aimed at restricting the amount of out-of-state 
garbage dumped in Virginia landfills. 
</P>
<P>
	The laws, passed by the General Assembly and signed by Gov. Jim  
Gilmore, would cap landfill growth and ban garbage barges from 
three Virginia rivers. The laws were to become effective Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor proposed the trash restrictions in January after  
learning that a Houston-based company, Waste Management Inc., 
planned to dump an additional 4,000 tons of New York City trash in 
Virginia each day. 
</P>
<P>
	Waste Management, which hauls trash from other states into  
Virginia, argued the state laws violate a provision of the U.S. 
Constitution that gives authority over interstate commerce 
exclusively to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge James Spencer approved Waste Management's  
request for a preliminary injunction Tuesday to keep the new laws 
off the books while the company's federal lawsuit is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer said there was ``ample likelihood of harm'' to Waste  
Management if the laws were allowed to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The state will appeal Spencer's ruling to the 4th U.S. Circuit  
Court of Appeals, said David Botkins, a spokesman for Attorney 
General Mark L. Earley. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia is the nation's second-leading trash importer, after  
Pennsylvania, with much of the imported garbage coming from New 
York City.

<HEADLINE> Marv Albert Rehired by NBC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Marv Albert can thank Fox for his return to NBC.  
</P>
<P>
	That's because NBC sports chairman Dick Ebersol read recent  
reports that Albert and Fox were negotiating a deal for Albert to 
join the network's NFL coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	So Ebersol acted quickly, bringing Albert back to NBC, where he  
began his network career in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was actually reading that Marv was in discussions with Fox,  
and it told me that this was the opportunity to move or we wouldn't 
be able to do this for three or four years,'' Ebersol said. ``I 
realized I'd better react immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert returned to NBC after being fired less than two years ago  
after he pleaded guilty in a sex case. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox executive producer Ed Goren understood Albert's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``On the one hand, we were looking forward to Marv being part of  
the NFL on Fox, but I'm thrilled that Marv will be back on NBC, 
where he belongs,'' Goren said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert, who once again will announce NBA games for the network,  
called his return ``kind of a euphoria -- a nice, weird feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just so happy to be back. ... There will be plenty of  
national exposures and I'm very satisfied to come home,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert won't return to his former role as the network's top  
play-by-play man for NBA games, but will complement its existing 
broadcast teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert, who agreed to a multiyear deal, will work about 15  
regular-season NBA games and the first four weekends of the 
playoffs. He will also be involved in boxing telecasts during the 
2000 Olympics and hockey in the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert began his national comeback this season when he was hired  
by Turner Sports in February to work NBA games. 
</P>
<P>
	He will make his return to NBC, where he worked from 1977-1997,  
before the end of the year -- probably on a studio show or NBC's 
first NBA telecast on Christmas Day. He will also continue with a 
full slate of some 25 regular-season games and a handful of 
postseason games on Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert also resigned from Madison Square Garden network shortly  
after being fired by NBC, but was brought back on board with MSG 
one year ago as the anchor of ``MSG Sports Desk'' and as the radio 
play-by-play voice for half of the New York Knicks games. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert's Turner debut came on TNT's broadcast of the Los Angeles  
Lakers game at Phoenix on April 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's better for me to look ahead than look back,'' Albert  
said. ``Everything's gone in the right direction in the past 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His last NBA national telecast for NBC was the finals in 1997.  
He also worked the NFL playoffs later that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault charges in  
September 1997 after being accused of biting his lover's back in a 
hotel room during a sexual encounter.

<HEADLINE> Drunken Driver Gets 49 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- A man has been sentenced to 49 years in  
prison for killing a pregnant woman and her daughter in a 
drunken-driving accident as he was headed to jail for driving 
drunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Branch, 33, was sentenced on Monday for the 1997 crash  
that killed Stefanie Brown Kuehl and 6-month-old Zadie. She was 
three months' pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Branch has utter contempt for the laws of society,'' Judge  
Chris Craft said. ``He has shown absolutely no remorse, and I 
believe when he's out, he'll start drinking and driving again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Branch was on his way to serve a weekend sentence at the county  
penal farm when his vehicle slammed into the side of Mrs. Kuehl's 
car. His blood-alcohol level was 0.22, more than twice the legal 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Branch was convicted in April of aggravated vehicular homicide  
involving alcohol and driving with a revoked license. He has two 
prior drunken driving convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'm not perfect, but I hope everyone can forgive me for  
the accident because it was not intentional,'' he said at his 
sentencing. ``I am a very cautious driver. I pay attention to 
everything around me.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Pitches Medicare Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- While the GOP gingerly picked through his  
Medicare plan, President Clinton pitched his ideas today like an 
easygoing salesman and teased the rival party: ``No one escapes 
time and age. Republicans age just like Democrats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president, opening a campaign for his proposed Medicare  
overhaul, addressed some 350 senior citizens inside the ornate 
Chicago Cultural Center. But his message also was aimed at 
Republicans laboring on Capitol Hill to find fault with his ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Loosen up, relax,'' Clinton said before taking the afternoon  
off at a Chicago Cubs game. 
</P>
<P>
	As women in the audience penciled notes on the back of their  
speech invitations, the president made a salesman's pitch, reeling 
off costs, copayments and growth projections of the Medicare 
proposal he unveiled on yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the money to do this. This is simply a matter of  
choice,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight, he is to be the guest of honor at a $500,000 Democratic  
party fund-raiser before returning to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has proposed new, universal coverage for prescription  
drugs -- at a 10-year cost of $118 billion to the government -- and 
the elimination of patient copayments for preventive services, in 
addition to incentives for Medicare patients to choose more 
cost-effective HMO's. 
</P>
<P>
	Frances Seidman, a retired Illinois state worker eager to shake  
Clinton's hand, said it was about time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medication is a huge expense and it always seemed strange to  
me it wasn't included,'' Mrs. Seidman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he can pay for the entire package and buttress  
Medicare against the coming wave of Baby Boom retirements by 
designating, over the next 15 years, $794 billion in expected 
federal budget surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 28-minute speech Wednesday, he thrice shadowboxed with  
Republicans who favor using surplus funds for tax cuts and who have 
their own ideas for securing Medicare's financial solvency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, I know there are a thousand good uses for this surplus,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Again, I say ...  
</P>
<P>
	``And I say again, there are many good uses for the surplus. I  
have my ideas, the Congress has their ideas. But first things 
first,'' he said. ``We have to take care of this problem and do it 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House invited Hanna Bratman, a 79-year-old Chicago  
widow to speak about how hard it can be to afford necessary 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
	With apologies for being nervous, Mrs. Bratman told the audience  
that she spends $2,800 a year -- about 10 percent of her income -- on 
inhalers for her asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have three of the dumb things, they make sure I can  
breathe,'' she said. ``It's hard to describe the fear of not 
knowing whether you'll be able to afford the next medication the 
doctor prescribes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a Republican lawmaker stung in the 1996 elections  
by Democratic charges the GOP wanted to gut Medicare, delicately 
criticized Clinton's plan as too generous to senior citizens who do 
not need help. 
</P>
<P>
	California Rep. Bill Thomas, chairman of the Ways and Means  
health subcommittee, circulated a ``Dear Colleague'' letter that 
offered several ``observations'' about the president's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proposal gives a drug benefit to everyone, regardless of  
whether they need it or not -- even retired millionaires. Two-thirds 
of seniors already have coverage. Why replace these private dollars 
with taxpayer dollars?'' Thomas wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, offered its troops  
``talking points,'' counseling them to ``be cautious about any 
changes that could lead to higher premiums for seniors or restrict 
seniors' choice of drugs, doctors or hospitals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their party, which controls Congress, was working on its own  
Medicare reforms ``that put seniors and their doctors in control of 
their health care decisions, not Washington bureaucrats and 
politicians,'' the RNC said.

<HEADLINE> TV's Finest Discuss Their Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- During the question-and-answer period, an  
audience member hailed the six men on stage as modern-day 
Shakespeares. Their predictable response: gracious scoffing all 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	But maybe their admirer was on to something. The Globe Theatre  
of Shakespeare's time has given way to the global theater of 
television, some of whose worthiest bards recently held forth at 
Manhattan's Museum of Television &AMP; Radio to swap thoughts on TV 
dramaturgy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Television is a writer's medium,'' Steven Bochco began, ``and  
every single one of us has gotten where we've gotten by virtue of 
being writers, not producers or directors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As writers accounting next season for 12 weekly dramas -- and  
surely among the best -- this was a team of TV all-stars kicking it 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	Here were Bochco (``NYPD Blue'' and a new midseason medical  
series for CBS); partners Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz 
(creators of the memorable ``thirtysomething'' returning with ABC's 
``Once and Again''); Dick Wolf (``Law &AMP; Order'' and its upcoming 
NBC spinoff ``Special Victims Unit'' as well as the WB midseason 
candidate ``D.C.''); and Tom Fontana (the departing ``Homicide,'' 
with a midseason UPN entry in the works as well as ``Oz,'' which 
returns to cable's HBO in two weeks). 
</P>
<P>
	Plus the preternaturally prolific David E. Kelley (``The  
Practice,'' ``Chicago Hope,'' ``Ally McBeal'' and ABC's upcoming 
``Snoops''), to whom the burning question was inevitably posed: How 
in blazes does he write so much good stuff so quickly? 
</P>
<P>
	``My acuity functions best, unfortunately, under the adrenaline  
of a deadline,'' he replied, deadpan-impish. ``If I have seven days 
to write a script, that's fine. But it won't be as good as if I 
only had four days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked and answered. Sort of.  
</P>
<P>
	This seminar was titled ``The Television Author: Shaping  
Character and Conscience,'' a timely topic indeed when television 
is not just looked at, but increasingly looked at as dangerous. 
Exactly what do these six fellows mean to accomplish with their 
dramas as they keep pushing TV into new areas of violence, 
explicitness and navel-gazing candor? 
</P>
<P>
	For Wolf, the goal is ``a thought response on the part of the  
viewer, rather than a cheap laugh or a horrified reaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think my job is to get people to talk about things,''  
Fontana said, explaining, ``I get confused by so many things that I 
ask a lot of questions in my writing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the tough social issues with which his shows have always  
wrestled, Bochco insisted that story precedes message. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never, ever sought to exploit a theme in anything I've  
ever done,'' he said. ``I have always trusted that if we construct 
a good story, that in the story the theme will emerge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But how accountable do these television auteurs hold themselves  
for the impact of that story, of that theme, on their viewers? 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel an overall sense of responsibility,'' Zwick declared.  
``What I'm trying to do is fundamentally humanistic -- the issues of 
being a person. Sometimes it's violent, sometimes it's scary, 
sometimes it's loving. But it's always interconnected and 
complicated. And that's the only responsibility I assume.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anyway, Fontana chimed in, what responsibility does TV news  
assume? He recalled that the ``Homicide'' episode scheduled for the 
Friday after April's Columbine High School shootings was abruptly 
deemed too violent by NBC, which postponed its airing. 
</P>
<P>
	Fine. But that same night's ``Dateline NBC'' was spared from  
such ideals, complained Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was two minutes of news about what's going on in  
Colorado and 50 minutes of graphics and music and -- they might as 
well have had showgirls,'' he said. ``The news can get away with 
exploiting a tragedy, whereas (for) drama guys: 'Ohhh, you've got 
to be sensitive.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always felt that the most dangerous areas of TV are  
television news,'' Marshall Herskovitz agreed, ``and commercials. 
Commercials are unindicted co-conspirators in this whole question 
of what entertainment does to the psyche of the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Let media-violence researchers tally the thousands of murders  
children see on TV. ``But how many times have they seen a product 
that makes them feel bad about themselves and their lives and how 
they look and what they have?'' asked Herskovitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochco voiced his own grievance about commercial breaks: They  
carve up his dramas. It's a fact of life, he allowed, ``but as a 
purely personal matter, I hate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder he and the other TV Shakespeares opt to watch their  
creations in a screening room, intact and unadulterated. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley shared his dismay at rediscovering how the other half  
watches: Recently he had been home visiting his parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're devoted to my shows,'' he said. ``But the phone was  
ringing. My father made a sandwich and then fell asleep. My mother 
asked me, 'Why is this person so upset?' I said, 'Mom, because the 
other person died while you went to the bathroom.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley sighed. ``You realize this is how most of America watches  
television,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he needn't fret. Four centuries ago, things got pretty rowdy  
at the Globe Theatre, too. 
</P>

	CHICAGO (AP) -- President Clinton beseeched the British and Irish  
today to ``give peace a chance,'' as they worked into the night to 
save the Northern Ireland peace pact. Clinton talked for 10 minutes 
with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and said he expected to stay 
in touch with various parties during the night. ``I will do 
whatever I can to be helpful,'' Clinton said. The prime ministers 
of Britain and Ireland have been in talks with political leaders of 
Northern Ireland, trying to agree on a formula for setting up the 
new local government and disarming the Irish Republican Army.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The stock market soared today after the  
Federal Reserve raised a key interest rate by a quarter-percentage

<HEADLINE> Francis Goes Second -- to Vancouver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steve Francis didn't simply walk to the  
podium. He swaggered his way his up those steps, raising both arms 
to the pro-Maryland crowd before shaking hands with commissioner 
David Stern. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way I am, nonchalant about everything,'' said  
Francis, completing the attitude with his all-black suit. ``That's 
the way I walk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the way he talks. Considered the favorite to be chosen  
first, Francis was the second player picked in Wednesday night's 
NBA draft. He was taken by the Vancouver Grizzlies after the 
Chicago Bulls pulled a mild surprise and took Duke's Elton Brand at 
No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took a big gamble,'' Francis said of the Bulls.  
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver has been a perennial doormat since joining the NBA in  
1995, and it's a long way from Francis' home in Silver Spring, Md. 
He didn't express any outright disappointment over the selection, 
but he wasn't exactly celebrating a dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, when I wake up tomorrow, I'll be happy,'' said  
Francis, who has never been to Canada. ``I feel relieved now more 
than happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francis said he hadn't seen the Grizzlies play much on  
television because he didn't pay attention to the NBA until the 
playoffs -- and, of course, Vancouver was finished by that time. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis declared early for the draft after playing only a year  
at Maryland following two successful years in junior college. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland coach Gary Williams said it was understandable if  
Francis seemed reluctant to go north of the border. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any kid growing up here that wears No. 23, if he had a shot at  
Chicago, maybe that was a dream growing up,'' Williams said. ``But 
he'll be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His selection brought a standing ovation and one of the biggest  
cheers of the night from the sellout crowd at the MCI Center, a 
short drive from the University of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	The local hype surrounding Francis reached incredible heights in  
the days before the draft. His backers even paid $40,000 to put up 
a six-story Francis mural-like poster across the street from the 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the near future, Francis put some swagger into his voice  
with his first prediction as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rookie of the year?'' he said. ``No doubt.''

<HEADLINE> Glance at Short-Term Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A look at some key short-term U.S. interest rates.  
</P>
<P>
	FEDERAL FUNDS RATE: The federal funds rate is the interest  
commercial banks charge each other on overnight loans. It derives 
its name from the bank's excess reserves held in accounts at 
Federal Reserve banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve policy-makers on Wednesday raised its target for  
the federal funds rate to 5.00 percent from the 4.75 percent rate 
that has prevailed since Nov. 17, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank resumed focusing closely on federal funds to  
implement its policy in the late 1980s. In that period, the federal 
funds rate has ranged from a high of 9.75 percent, reached Feb. 23, 
1989 and lasting until June 6, 1989, to a low of 3 percent, which 
was set on Sept. 4, 1992 and remained until Feb. 4, 1994. In the 
past 25 years in open-market trading, the rate got as high as 22.36 
percent on July 22, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	DISCOUNT RATE: The Fed left its discount rate unchanged at the  
4.50 percent that has prevailed since last Nov. 17. The discount 
rate is the interest the Federal Reserve charges member banks for 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past 25 years, the discount rate reached as high as 14  
percent, set on May 5, 1981 and in effect through Nov. 2, 1981. It 
got as low as 3 percent, a level that prevailed from July 2, 1992 
until May 17, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	PRIME RATE: After the Fed raised its target for the federal  
funds rate, Bank of America announced it was raising its prime 
lending rate, effective Thursday, to 8 percent from the the 7.75 
percent that has prevailed since last Nov. 18. Other leading banks 
quickly followed the move. 
</P>
<P>
	The prime rate, sometimes called ``the reference rate,'' is a  
base upon which banks compute interest on commercial loans. The 
interest rate on many credit cards is linked to the prime rate. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past 25 years, the prime rate has climbed as high as 21.5  
percent, a level held from Dec. 19, 1980 until Jan. 2, 1981. In 
that period, it has fallen as low as 5.5 percent at one major bank 
in 1993, but the industry as a whole has not had a prime rate lower 
than the 6 percent that prevailed from July 2, 1992 to March 23, 
1994.

<HEADLINE> Four Special Olympians Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Additional precautions are unneeded at the  
Special Olympics World Summer Games despite the disappearance of 
four athletes, organizers said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Moroccan soccer players were reported missing Tuesday night  
from their nation's delegation. Last week, two Special Olympians 
from the Dominican Republic left a shopping trip in Greensboro, 
took a cab to Charlotte and then caught a bus to New York, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	None had been found by police.  
</P>
<P>
	Joe Freddoso, chief executive officer of the Games, said each  
delegation is responsible for policing its own athletes, noting 
there is a 4-to-1 ratio of athletes-to-coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you go to the Olympic Games or an NCAA basketball  
tournament, the team members are pretty much on their own -- they're 
adults,'' Freddoso said Wednesday. ``For us to put more 
restrictions on whether they can go down to Hillsborough Street and 
go shopping or go to Crabtree Valley Mall would be a bit intrusive, 
and I don't think appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The athletes are here to have fun and compete, and those who  
can work and live independently, we need to give them that 
independence. It's a total experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freddoso grew irritated when pressed on the subject.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think what you're seeing is pretty commonplace. The only  
reason the questions are coming up is that we are dealing with 
athletes with mental retardation. We have to realize they are able 
to function on their own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two Moroccan athletes, Niam Tanji, 21, and Jamal Agdani, 23,  
were last seen at lunch Monday and did not attend their soccer 
match later in the day, event officials said Tuesday. The coach 
told the head of the Moroccan delegation. Games organizers were 
then alerted. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no indication of any foul play, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
	The two were staying in dormitories at North Carolina State.

<HEADLINE> Iowa QB Reiners Gets Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Iowa quarterback Randy Reiners, arrested  
for the second time in 18 months on an alcohol charge, could be 
suspended from the team for violating school policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Second offenses typically do,'' athletic director Bob Bowlsby  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reiners, 22, of Fort Dodge, was arrested at 2:26 a.m. Tuesday  
after being found ``sleeping or passed out'' in a university 
parking lot, court records showed. 
</P>
<P>
	He failed an alcohol breath test before being arrested.  
</P>
<P>
	Iowa football coach Kirk Ferentz, who is on vacation, said in a  
statement Wednesday that ``this is an unfortunate incident for all 
involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on what I know at this point, it appears Randy Reiners  
has violated a longstanding departmental policy and must now face 
the consequences of his actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ferentz said Reiners showed ``good judgment'' by not driving but  
that, ``on the other hand, he put himself in a position that will 
very likely lead to a suspension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reiners paid a $50 fine and $15 in court costs on the public  
intoxication charge Tuesday in Johnson County District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlsby said the protocol for second-time violators is ``well  
enunciated'' for the school's athletic teams. The penalty normally 
involves a suspension, counseling and mandatory abuse class. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlsby and Ann Rhodes, vice president for university relations,  
both declined to speculate about how long Reiners might be 
suspended from the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``In cases involving drinking or substance use, I like to try  
and balance the treatment component with the sanction component. At 
this point, I don't know how that's all going to work out yet,'' 
Rhodes said Wednesday. ``To be real honest with you, I don't think 
that this is something we need an immediate decision. We don't have 
a game right around the corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reiners, one of three quarterbacks fighting for the starting  
job, said he ``just got in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I got drunk. I was walking home and I sat on a bench because I  
thought I was going to get sick. That's when the cops came. I 
wasn't causing any problems, though,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1998, Reiners was arrested and charged with drunken  
driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Reiners started four games last year for the Hawkeyes, throwing  
for 521 yards, three touchdowns and six interceptions. He missed 
the spring game in April because of a knee injury.

<HEADLINE> Sports Writer Harold Rosenthal Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Harold Rosenthal, a sports writer  
and author who covered baseball and football in a career that 
spanned five decades, died from complications following a stroke. 
He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenthal, who died Tuesday, worked for more than three decades  
for the New York Herald Tribune, and was especially noted for his 
baseball coverage from 1947 through 1963. He reported on games of 
the Giants, Dodgers, Yankees and Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	When the newspaper went out of business in 1966, Rosenthal moved  
into public relations, first with the Continental Football League. 
After working briefly for the New York Giants, he became public 
relations director of the American Football League and, when it 
merged with the NFL, he served as director of information for the 
American Football Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He left the NFL in 1974 and worked briefly as public relations  
director of New American Library. He was also managing editor of 
Weekend Sports, a television sports newspaper supplement, and 
contributed to many magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote columns for the New York City Tribune from 1978-1991  
and appeared in a number of HBO and ESPN documentaries on baseball 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenthal was a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers Hall of Fame and  
author of a number of books, including ``Baseball Is Their 
Business'' and ``The Ten Best Years of Baseball.'' In football, he 
wrote ``Fifty Faces of Football'' and ``Playing Pro Football to 
Win,'' with Johnny Unitas. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in the Army Air Force during World War II.  
</P>
<P>
	An lifetime member of the Baseball Writers Association and  
former president of the New York Football Writers Association, he 
is survived by his wife of 58 years, Alice, a daughter, Jane Ann 
Neff, and a granddaughter. A son, Jonas, died in 1997.

<HEADLINE> No Sign of Japan Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's economic slide has bottomed out, although  
there are no signs yet of a recovery, the head of the Bank of Japan 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Masaru Hayami has said the same thing before, but his assessment  
has taken on new significance following a recent report of 
surprisingly robust economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders and investors are listening closely to Hayami's comments  
for any signs the central bank to raise interest rates from 
historic lows. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's gross domestic product -- the measure of all goods and  
services produced within its borders -- expanded 1.9 percent for the 
first quarter of the year after more than a year of recession. 
</P>
<P>
	But economists and others worry that economic activity remains  
weak and Japan could sink back into recession unless the central 
bank keeps rates low and the government does more to boost consumer 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's central bank has already taken the extremely unusual  
step of lowering short-term interest rates almost to zero, hoping 
that the prospect of nearly free loans will encourage companies to 
invest more. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to the budget committee of the lower house of  
parliament, Hayami said the central bank's near-zero interest rate 
policy ``has been taken to address an emergency situation for the 
Japanese economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Hayami did not say the bank was considering a rate hike,  
his reference to the current policy as an ``emergency'' measure was 
interpreted by financial market types as meaning it could be also a 
temporary one. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rates rose and the dollar fell against the yen in Tokyo  
on Wednesday following Hayami's comments on speculation that the 
bank could be warming to the idea of raising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates in Japan would make the yen-based deposits  
and investments more attractive to international investors.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Chiquita Lawyer Pleads No Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A former Chiquita lawyer accused of stealing  
voice-mail messages from the banana company that were used in a 
newspaper expose pleaded no contest to reduced charges Wednesday 
and got two years on probation. 
</P>
<P>
	George G. Ventura, who had been scheduled to go on trial next  
week, entered his plea to misdemeanor charges of attempted 
unauthorized access to computer systems. In exchange, prosecutors 
dropped 10 felony charges that carried up to 12 1/2 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to putting him on probation, Common Pleas Judge Ann  
Marie Tracey ordered the 38-year-old lawyer to perform 40 hours of 
community service. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will say, Mr. Ventura, that as an attorney, I'm appalled at  
the betrayal of trust to your client and to the legal profession,'' 
the judge said. ``I'm sure you understand that your fellow lawyers 
here do not appreciate your conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had accused Ventura of providing The Cincinnati  
Enquirer with secret access codes for the voice-mailboxes of 
executives of Cincinnati-based Chiquita Brands International Inc. 
Ventura had access to the codes because he was Chiquita's legal 
counsel in Honduras from 1991 to 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Enquirer used the voice mail in preparing a May 1998 series  
on alleged improper business practices by Chiquita -- stories that 
Chiquita said gave a slanted portrayal of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The following month, the Enquirer renounced the articles, fired  
reporter Michael Gallagher and paid Chiquita more than $10 million, 
acknowledging the stories were based in part on stolen voice mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher pleaded guilty in September to illegally gaining  
access to Chiquita's voice mail system. He could get up to 2 1/2 years 
in prison at sentencing July 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher also identified Ventura as one of his confidential  
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has cost Ventura his job with a Salt Lake City law  
firm, he faces thousands of dollars in legal bills, and his license 
could be suspended or revoked. 
</P>
<P>
	In court, Ventura spoke up only to confirm that he understood  
and accepted the plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement given to reporters, Ventura said he was promised  
anonymity as a source for the Enquirer but was betrayed. He blames 
the Enquirer and its parent, the Gannett Co., said his lawyer, Marc 
Mezibov. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither The Cincinnati Enquirer nor Gannett have revealed any  
confidential sources,'' said Harry Whipple, Enquirer president and 
publisher. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiquita spokesman Joseph Hagin had no comment on Ventura's  
plea.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A former Chiquita lawyer accused of stealing  
voice-mail messages from the company that were used in a newspaper 
expose pleaded no contest today to reduced charges. 
</P>
<P>
	George Ventura entered his plea to four misdemeanor charges of  
attempted unauthorized access to computer systems. Hamilton County 
Common Pleas Judge Ann Marie Tracey then found Ventura guilty of 
the misdemeanor charges. 
</P>
<P>
	She sentenced Ventura to two years in jail but then suspended  
the term in favor of two years of probation and 40 hours of 
community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura declined to comment to reporters. In court, he spoke up  
only to confirm to the judge that he understood terms of the plea 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten felony counts of unlawful interception of communications and  
unauthorized access to computer systems were dropped. They could 
have brought up to 12 1/2 years in prison. The plea deal averts a 
trial that was to have begun next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors accused Ventura, of Salt Lake City, of providing The  
Cincinnati Enquirer with secret access codes for voice-mailboxes of 
corporate executives of Chiquita Brands International Inc. 
Prosecutors said Ventura had access to the codes because he was 
Chiquita's legal counsel in Honduras from 1991 to 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Enquirer used information obtained from the illegally  
obtained messages as part of its May 1998 reports on alleged 
improper business practices by the Chiquita, the Cincinnati-based 
banana giant has charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The Enquirer renounced the articles in June 1998, fired reporter  
Michael Gallagher and paid Chiquita more than $10 million. Chiquita 
said that the reporting gave a slanted portrayal of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher pleaded guilty in September to two felony charges of  
illegally gaining access to Chiquita's voice mail system. He is to 
be sentenced July 16 and faces anything from probation to 2 1/2 years 
in prison, plus a fine of up to $7,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher identified Ventura in court as one of his confidential  
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron McWhirter, the other Enquirer reporter who worked on the  
Chiquita stories, is now with The Detroit News, another Gannett Co. 
newspaper. McWhirter has not been charged in the case and has 
declined to identify any sources. McWhirter has said he gave the 
voice-mail access codes to Gallagher and did not get into the 
system himself.

<HEADLINE> Congress Holds Gambling Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the federal budget approaching $2  
trillion, members of Congress aren't normally fazed by big dollar 
figures. But former Philadelphia Eagles owner Leonard Tose had some 
heads shaking on Capitol Hill today when he estimated his gambling 
losses at $40 million to $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Tose put a human face on the issue of compulsive gambling at a  
congressional hearing on increased funding for research into 
gambling addiction. Tose joked that he was a compulsive gambler 
``only when I had money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gambling debts forced the former trucking magnate to sell the  
Eagles football team in 1985. And on his 81st birthday in 1996, he 
was evicted from his seven-bedroom Philadelphia home after losing 
the house in a U.S. marshal's sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who called the hearing, was  
straightforward about his distaste for gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like it,'' he said. ``I think it goes after people who  
can't afford to lose money. I think it has an effect of a very 
regressive attack. It's antisocial and bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specter, who chairs the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on  
labor, education and health and human services, said afterward that 
the National Institutes of Health may need a funding increase if 
they are to undertake new studies recommended by a federal 
commission on gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Gambling Impact Study Commission submitted a report  
June 18 that focused heavily on the need for more research to 
address ``a dearth of impartial, objective research'' that remained 
even after the panel spent half of its $5 million budget on new 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harvard Medical School Division of Addiction estimated in  
1997 that 4.4 million American adults and adolescents are 
pathological gamblers and another 11 million are problem gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's 16 research recommendations include NIH  
sponsorship of studies on pathological gambling, especially among 
youths, and on adults with gambling problems that are not yet 
severe, as well as the inclusion of gambling questions in periodic 
household surveys on drug abuse and surveys of mental health 
providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-gambling Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., did not object to research  
but said, ``I want to make sure in this discussion of gambling that 
we're not making excuses for people who look at gambling as a form 
of entertainment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tose agreed, even though he unsuccessfully accused Atlantic  
City's Sands Hotel &AMP; Casino in a lawsuit of encouraging him to 
drink and to gamble away $10 million while drunk.

<HEADLINE> Gay Ambassador Sworn In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sedate events are the norm in the gilded  
confines of the State Department's eighth floor reception room but 
there can be exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The atmosphere was downright raucous Tuesday over a seemingly  
routine happening: the swearing in of a new ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	James Hormel, who is gay, took the oath as ambassador to  
Luxembourg in the presence of hundreds of friends who had supported 
Hormel's oft-troubled nomination since it was first announced 20 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel's supporters cheered loudly as was sworn in as America's  
first openly gay ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	``What an incredible privilege it is to be standing before you  
today,'' Hormel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was there, along with  
Sens. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. 
Television cameras lined the rear of the majestic State Department 
hall. Normal procedure on such occasions is to bar the press 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	Uncertainty had shrouded Hormel's appointment almost from the  
day he was nominated because of opposition from a relatively small 
group of senators. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton broke the impasse three weeks ago when he made  
Hormel a ``recess appointment'' -- a method that circumvents the 
normal Senate confirmation process. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department generally shies away from partisanship, but  
the whiff of politics was in the air as Albright joined Hormel, a 
longtime Democratic donor and activist, for the festivities and 
spoke on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Gay rights have been a high-profile theme for the Democrats as  
campaigning for next year's election picks up steam. Vice President 
Al Gore visited a gay and lesbian center during a campaign visit to 
California last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Traditional Values Coalition, a church lobby that opposed  
the nomination, said in a statement that the swearing in of Hormel 
marks ``the beginning of the Gore campaign's efforts to woo the 
homosexual vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coalition members demonstrated in protest outside the State  
Department as the ceremony was taking place. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of those glorious days when the nice guy finishes  
first,'' Albright told the gathering. ``Neither race, nor creed, 
nor gender nor sexual orientation should be relevant to the 
selection of ambassadors for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Kennedy: ``There was never any honorable question about his  
qualifications to be ambassador.'' The opposition to Hormel was 
``irresponsible and unacceptable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Feinstein, noting that Hormel's appointment cleared the Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee by 16-2, said he would have been 
approved by an overwhelming majority had the Senate voted as a 
whole. By tradition, even one senator can prevent a vote on a 
nomination because of a personal grievance. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Jim's appointment, I think we open a door,'' Feinstein  
said.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Labs Security Gaps Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even after an uproar over espionage and poor  
security, investigators found troublesome security gaps at a major 
nuclear weapons laboratory in California, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The shortcomings, discovered in a review in early May at the  
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, included inadequate 
monitoring of access to the unclassified computer system and 
deficiencies in the security force's response to potential 
terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings by an Energy Department security oversight team  
were to be presented in a classified briefing to the House Commerce 
Committee on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	While not discussing the findings in detail, Glenn Podonsky, who  
headed the internal DOE investigation, said that the security 
weaknesses did not put any top-secret information at risk, but 
showed some ``sensitive'' information needed to be better 
protected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's serious because from our standpoint it needed to be  
corrected,'' Podonsky said in an interview. ``These are holes that 
need to be plugged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee heard for the first  
time Wednesday from Sandy Berger, the president's national security 
adviser, on the security and espionage concerns at the nuclear 
weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions about security at nuclear weapons facilities arose in  
March as details from a congressional investigation began to 
surface describing the loss of nuclear secrets to China in the 
1980s and into the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy intensified after Energy Secretary Bill  
Richardson directed the firing of a scientist at the Los Alamos lab 
in New Mexico in early March after he had been under investigation 
for possible espionage since 1996. The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, has 
not been charged with any crime and has denied giving nuclear 
secrets to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators, in the closed sessions, were expected to question  
Berger closely about why the administration did not move quicker to 
deal with reports of the theft of nuclear secrets at Los Alamos. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger, who then was deputy security adviser, has said that he  
first learned of concerns about the Los Alamos problem in April 
1996 and was briefed more thoroughly in mid-1997. At that time, he 
advised President Clinton, who issued a presidential directive to 
beef up security in February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A report by the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board  
indicated, however, that the White House may have been made aware 
as early 1995 by then-Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary about the 
possible theft at Los Alamos of secrets involving the sophisticated 
W-88 nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	The DOE security review at Livermore was conducted by inspectors  
from the new Office of Security Oversight in late April and early 
May at Richardson's request. Similar inspections will be made at 
the Los Alamos and Sandia labs in New Mexico in the coming weeks, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The special audit found continued weaknesses in computer  
security and lax safeguards against outside physical attacks at the 
Livermore lab, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	It found that foreigners were able to dial into the lab's  
unclassified computer, and electronic mail in the unclassified 
system wasn't adequately being monitored, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The review also found that the lab's security forces did not  
have an adequate plan to counter potential attacks by terrorists. 
Reaction time was slow and not all ``pathways'' for potential 
access were adequately covered, according to an official involved 
in the study. He spoke on condition of not being further 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to conducting top-secret nuclear weapons research,  
the Livermore lab also has considerable nuclear weapons material on 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the Commerce Committee,  
said he had not yet seen the classified report but that from what 
he has learned about the Livermore review, it indicates that 
Richardson should ``spend ... more time in the trenches of the 
department bureaucracy fixing these very serious security 
problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Podonsky, a career security specialist who headed the  
investigation, strongly defended Richardson's response to security 
concerns at the department and said it was the secretary who 
ordered the special reviews at the weapons labs.

<HEADLINE> Leading Indicators Up 0.3 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A key gauge of future economic activity rose 0.3  
percent in May, more than reversing a 0.1 percent decline in April 
and keeping the U.S. economy on track to achieve its longest 
expansion ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a private business group, reported today  
that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators, which spots growth 
trends for the coming three to six months, rose to 107.4 in May 
from 107.1 in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leading indicators show the resilience and robustness of  
this expansion, which is poised to become the longest ever in early 
2000,'' said Michael Boldin, director of business cycle research at 
The Conference Board. ``There is little evidence of cyclical 
imbalances that would jeopardize the economy's stability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The longest economic expansion in U.S. history lasted for 106  
months, from February 1962 until December 1969. The current 
expansion, already the longest peacetime growth ever, would match 
the record if it continues through January 2000 and pass it if it 
lasts until February. 
</P>
<P>
	The Leading Indicators report came on a day Federal Reserve  
policy-makers were widely expected to raise short-term interest 
rates by one-quarter of a percentage point in a pre-emptive bid to 
cool the economy's torrid growth and prevent a rekindling of 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Leading Indicators report was in line with  
economists' expectations, investors still drove securities prices 
lower ahead of the Fed's meeting. At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the 
Dow Jones industrial average was down 62.06 at 10,753.29. Bond 
prices were lower as well, with the 30-year Treasury bond down 
$4.69 per $1,000 value, yielding 6.095 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Boldin said Conference Board's report should not encourage  
Fed governors to make further rate hikes after today. He said even 
if the Fed were to raise rates a half percentage point, it would 
not jeopardize the current pace of growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine out of 10 indicators that make up the leading index rose in  
May. The most significant increase came in a slowing of vendor 
deliveries. Slower deliveries means busy manufacturers are backed 
up in fulfilling their orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Another big contributor to the growth in the index was an  
increase in the nation's money supply, indicating that individuals 
and companies have more cash to invest in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Another component, the difference between the yield on 10-year  
Treasury notes and the Federal Reserve's overnight funds rate, also 
rose. That is a sign that financial companies are earning higher 
returns on their loans -- also an incentive to invest, Boldin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices were the only component to show a decrease in May,  
though that was insignificant, the Conference Board said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite slower vendor deliveries, the report showed only a  
slight increase in new orders to manufacturers for consumer goods 
and materials. Average weekly initial claims for unemployment 
insurance rose only slightly, as did building permits and the 
average work week for production workers.

<HEADLINE> Bush Raises More Money Than Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush has raised more money than all  
10 Republican rivals combined and millions of dollars more than 
Vice President Al Gore in the first six months of the 2000 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor was revealing his record-setting dollar haul  
today, the final day of the second quarterly reporting period, even 
as he attended another fund-raiser in California. Senior Republican 
officials said last week Bush was expected to report at least $23 
million in contributions. With last-minute money pouring in, 
officials said the final total would be much higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who released his totals Tuesday, collected $18.2 million  
to $18.5 million in the first six months of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	His only rival, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, will report  
slightly more than $11.5 million in overall contributions, 
according to his spokesman Eric Hauser. 
</P>
<P>
	``This demonstrates the strength of Al Gore's support throughout  
the country,'' Gore's deputy chairman, Marla Romash, said. 
</P>
<P>
	After raising twice as much as Bradley in the first three months  
of the year, Gore watched the second-quarter margin close: He 
raised about $9 million in the last three months, compared with a 
surprisingly strong $7 million for underdog Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``That shows there are still a lot of people out there who would  
like to see a horse race,'' said Stephen Hess of the Brookings 
Institution, a Washington think tank. ``While Gore seems to want to 
give the impression that we can skip the preliminaries and go right 
to the general election, it's not that simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is far ahead of Bradley in polls of Democratic voters. The  
latest CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll gave Gore a 3-1 lead over the 
former basketball-star-turned-politician. 
</P>
<P>
	``That, to us, is the margin that counts,'' Romash said. ``Al  
Gore never takes anything for granted and runs every race as the 
challenger, but it's important to note that when you look at who 
Democratic voters are supporting, overwhelmingly it's Al Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romash said Gore would break the second-quarter fund-raising  
total set by Bob Dole in 1995. But so would Bush, whose 
second-quarter fund raising could be twice as much as Gore's $9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as campaign number crunchers tried to keep tabs on the  
receipts, Bush was amassing more donations. He was attending a 
fund-raiser in Sacramento, Calif., today as part of a $4.2 million 
swing through the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is virtually drying up the pool of Republican cash, causing  
his rivals to struggle to stay afloat. According to campaign aides: 
</P>
<P>
	--Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, has raised $1.6 million this year,  
including just $600,000 in the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
	--Former Vice President Dan Quayle expects to raise $1 million in  
the second quarter after taking $2.1 million in the first three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	--Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, like Quayle, has cut  
staff and travel plans to make ends meet. He will report raising 
more than $2 million overall. 
</P>
<P>
	--Arizona Sen. John McCain, chairman of the influential Senate  
Commerce Committee, is doing better than other non-Bush hopefuls, 
but still will report raising less than $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	--Publisher Steve Forbes, former American Red Cross President  
Elizabeth Dole and conservative activist Gary Bauer will be in the 
$2 million to $4 million range, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	--New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith, a longshot, will report more than  
$1 million in contributions, spokeswoman Karen Hickey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives Pat Buchanan and Alan Keyes did not provide  
figures.

<HEADLINE> Earth May Have a Twin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Somewhere out there, Earth may have a ``twin'' planet capable of  
supporting life, according to a report in today's issue of the 
journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	David Stevenson of the California Institute of Technology said  
Earth may have had one or more siblings when the solar system was 
born, but they were jettisoned by gravity when they got too close 
to Jupiter or other large planets. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea has been around for a while. Stevenson goes a step  
further, drawing on planetary theory and his own calculations to 
argue that these Earth-like planets may be capable of supporting 
life, despite their wanderings through the cold, dark void, far 
from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life would have to be simple,'' he said. ``Certainly you  
wouldn't have much of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said these planets may be heated by a dense hydrogen  
atmosphere and volcanoes, instead of sunlight. The combined heat 
could be enough to sustain warm oceans, which could nourish the 
formation of life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a very logical conclusion from what we know about  
planet formation,'' said Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution in 
Washington, one of the leaders in the search for other solar 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has ever actually found one these so-called rogue  
planets. Nevertheless, there could be millions, even billions, of 
them roaming the galaxy in the dark, carrying water and simple 
life, Stevenson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other scientists agree there is little doubt that planets were  
ejected from the primordial solar system. But they are unsure 
whether these bodies have the atmosphere and other means to sustain 
even simple life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because you can make an atmosphere doesn't mean you can  
keep it,'' said Jonathan Lunine at the University of Arizona. ``You 
have to ask whether that atmosphere, when perturbed very slightly, 
would return to its regular state or just collapse onto the 
surface.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson said that rogue planets could have clouds and even  
lightning, but not the constantly shifting weather on Earth that is 
largely driven by sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The temperature would be very uniform from place to place. It  
would be a dull place in that sense, and of course it would be 
totally dark,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of actually finding a rogue planet is very small  
indeed, scientists agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like finding a grain of sand inside the Earth,'' Boss  
said.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Subway Revamped for July Fourth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With 600,000 people expected to ride the  
subway to Washington's July Fourth celebration, transit officials 
have decided to shuffle the system's blue, orange and green lines. 
</P>
<P>
	People who ride a certain line every day to work may find  
themselves needing a train of another color to get to the same 
place on Sunday. And, if they're not paying attention and hop their 
usual train, they may wind up somewhere they don't want to be. 
</P>
<P>
	But Metro officials say the reworked lines will be clearly  
labeled and should help people reach the National Mall and return 
home more quickly than on previous July Fourth holidays. A year 
ago, 575,000 people rode Metrorail and it took many of them two 
hours or more to get home after the fireworks display.

<HEADLINE> Senate Rejects Easing Cuba Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate approved a $12.7 billion foreign  
aid package late Wednesday after rejecting, on a 55-43 vote, an 
effort to sharply ease restrictions on Americans who want to travel 
to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors said 38 years of sanctions have failed to produce much  
impact on the policies of Cuba's Fidel Castro -- and it was time to 
try something new. Opponents argued it would undermine U.S. policy 
toward the communist government. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would send a signal to Fidel Castro that we're prepared to  
do something without anything in response,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, 
D-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., the chief sponsor of the  
rejected proposal, asked: ``What's the purpose of a further 
isolation (of Cuba) if in 40 years it hasn't produced a change?'' 
</P>
<P>
	After rejecting the proposal by Dodd, the Senate approved, 97-2,  
the overall foreign aid package. The House has yet to take up 
similar legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would provide $535 million to the Serbian province  
of Kosovo and various Balkan and Eastern European states next year. 
The White House is threatening a veto of the overall bill, mainly 
on grounds that it cuts too much from what it views as critical 
programs, including the Peace Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide $1.9 billion less than President Clinton  
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Another section opposed by the administration would add $20  
million for a security force in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	A White House statement on Wednesday said this provision ``could  
be interpreted as aimed at training and equipping the Kosovo 
Liberation Army'' and that this was ``diametrically at odds'' with 
the recent agreement by the KLA to disarm under NATO supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of the Senate  
Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee, told the Senate 
that ``members of the KLA may very well be included in a security 
force, but that is not a decision for us to make.'' He said the 
measure does not provide express support for arming or supporting 
the KLA. 
</P>
<P>
	On the effort to ease travel restrictions on Cuba, the proposal  
by Dodd would have allowed all U.S. citizens the same liberalized 
travel rights to go to Cuba that journalists and government 
officials now enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, there are no regular flights from U.S. airports to  
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Direct charter flights to Cuba were legal until 1996 when Cuba  
shot down two Miami-based planes carrying anti-Castro activists 
attempting to drop leaflets over the island country. Clinton 
retaliated by banning charter flights, but reinstated them in March 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the government imposes sharp restrictions on who can  
travel, mostly limiting travel rights to those who have families in 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., opposed the move to relax these  
restrictions. Even under the current setup, some 100,000 Americans 
a year have been visiting Cuba, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our argument with Fidel Castro is not over,'' Torricelli said.  
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the easing complained that Americans are free to  
travel to many other countries that have authoritarian governments, 
including China. 
</P>
<P>
	But any move to lift restrictions on Cuba always brings  
vociferous objections, particularly from those with a large number 
of Cuban-American constituents. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the time for lifting any of the sanctions on  
Cuba,'' said Florida's Graham. ``This is the time for us to hold 
the line on our policy.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Longtime presidential friend Webster Hubbell  
pleaded guilty today to a felony for concealing his and first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton's legal work on a fraudulent land deal back 
in Arkansas. Prosecutors recommended no jail time or fine. As part 
of a deal with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, prosecutors asked 
that Hubbell serve one year of probation. U.S. District Judge James 
Robertson will decide the sentence. Hubbell also pleaded guilty to

ethnic Albanians as refugees flood back into the province. It is 
Mary Robinson's first trip into Kosovo since NATO peacekeepers 
began deploying in the province June 12 as Serbian troops withdrew 
under a peace accord that ended the 78-day allied air war. 
International investigators, meanwhile, are uncovering widespread

biological warfare may be delayed while the only company that 
produces the vaccine figures out how to cover the costs of the 
shots, according to congressional critics. BioPort is experiencing 
a cash-flow crisis, a congressional memo says. Nearly 300,000 
service members have been immunized so far. To make the vaccine, 
BioPort is seeking an advance payment of $10 million, an 
approximately fivefold increase in the per-shot price to about $20, 
and permission to sell up to 300,000 doses each year on the open 
market.

at giving the state more flexibility in setting its primary date

tournament again after losing today to No. 2 Patrick Rafter. 
Becker, a three-time Wimbledon champion, two years ago said he 
would never again play at the All-England Club, but changed his 
mind and decided this year to take one more chance. Also today, 
five-time Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras powered into the 
quarterfinals with a straight-sets victory against Daniel Nestor. 
And seven-time women's champion Steffi Graf completed an easy 
victory over 16-year-old Belgian qualifier Kim Clijsters. Graf will 
next face Venus Williams, who rallied to beat Anna Kournikova 3-6, 
6-3, 6-2.

<HEADLINE> Becker Bids Wimbledon Adieu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Boris Becker bowed to the Royal Box.  
He raised his arms to acknowledge a standing ovation. He signed a 
few autographs, shook hands with referee Alan Mills, then ducked 
through the green door into the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	For the last time.  
</P>
<P>
	Becker said farewell to Wimbledon on Wednesday -- and, this time,  
for good. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, after a loss to Pete Sampras, Becker announced he  
had made his final appearance at the All England Club. 
</P>
<P>
	But he changed his mind and came back this year for one last  
hurrah. Becker surprised even himself by charging into the final 
16, but he was no match for Australia's second-seeded Patrick 
Rafter on Wednesday, losing 6-3, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Was this the final goodbye?  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, yes, definitely,'' the 31-year-old German said. ``Last  
time, I said 99 percent. Now I say 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Becker has been associated with Wimbledon for 16 years. He  
reached the third round in his first appearance in 1984, then 
stunned the tennis world by winning the tournament as a 17-year-old 
in 1985. He retained his title in 1986, won it again in 1989 and 
was runner-up four times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an incredible ride,'' he said. ``I've won more  
matches here than anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Becker became so fond of the grass at Wimbledon that he  
described Centre Court as his ``living room.'' The crowds loved his 
dashing style and intimidating power. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great love affair,'' Becker said. ``It was like  
nowhere else in the world. The place was always very special to me. 
It made who I am today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Becker overcame Britain's Miles Maclagan in the first round  
after saving three match points, then punished young German 
pretender Nicolas Kiefer in straight sets and dominated Australian 
teen-age star Lleyton Hewitt, also in straight sets. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Rafter, however, Becker looked out of his league. His  
biggest weapon -- the serve -- let him down. He had 13 double faults, 
and his first serve percentage was below 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter broke Becker eight times, including in the final game of  
the match when Becker hit a low backhand volley wide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I left my serve at home,'' he said. ``I had not timing on my  
serve at all. Every time I served, it was a struggle. It was very 
unfortunate I was not able to give him and the crowd a better match 
for my last match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter said he knew what the occasion meant to Becker but didn't  
let it affect his game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does have a presence out there but his game wasn't really  
firing today and I felt like I couldn't hit the ball much better 
either,'' he said. ``So it wasn't a good combination for him to 
leave on. ... But I don't feel bad for beating him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Becker said he had no regrets about coming back.  
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe the way I have been playing the last 10  
days here,'' he said. ``I didn't expect at all to be in the round 
of 16 playing Pat Rafter. But he outplayed me. He was a class 
better. I'm thankful I had a chance to come back and play decent 
tennis. Now it's time to do something else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Becker and his wife, Barbara, are expecting their second child  
this summer. They have a 5-year-old son, Noah Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker said he will remain involved in tennis in coaching,  
including as captain of Germany's Davis Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he will miss most about Wimbledon, Becker didn't  
hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to compare any other feeling than going on Centre  
Court, especially if it's in a final,'' he said. ``It's an 
experience where all the players will agree with me. It's one of a 
kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is one thing, though, that Becker wishes he could change.  
</P>
<P>
	``What really bugs me all along is losing four finals,'' he  
said. ``That's four too many. If you're in the final seven times 
and only come out three times as a winner, that's not a good 
percentage.''

<HEADLINE> N.D. Town Considers Relocating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEWAUKAN, N.D. (AP) -- Devils Lake is earning its name.  
</P>
<P>
	Townspeople have watched in growing alarm as the lake in  
northern North Dakota laps closer and closer, swelled by months of 
rain and heavy snow. The lake is no longer eight miles away; 
basements get wet, and on a windy day waves lap the corner of the 
high school football field. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Callahan said the 350 residents of the community 110 miles  
west of Grand Forks have tough decisions to make as the lake 
continues to rise. Many have never lived anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has a big question mark,'' the teacher said as a  
light rain fell Tuesday. ``Do you leave? Do you stay? Do you move 
the town?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Devils Lake has risen about 24 feet in seven years -- about 2 1/2  
feet just in the past 12 months -- because it sits in a closed basin 
with nowhere for water to drain. It has flooded more than 120,000 
acres this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The county surrounding Minnewaukan has gotten 8 to 15 inches of  
rain since May 1 and about 3.2 million acres of North Dakota 
cropland, or about 16 percent of the total, are considered too wet 
for planting. 
</P>
<P>
	The city of Devils Lake sits right next to the water and already  
has had to move several hundred lakeside houses to drier ground. 
The city of 8,000 has built its dikes higher over the past four 
years, and two major highways into town have been raised several 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Minnewaukan and nearby Churchs Ferry had been  
counting on the Army Corps of Engineers to drain water from Devils 
Lake, possibly by digging an outlet to a nearby river. 
</P>
<P>
	But the corps said that would be too expensive, at $103 million.  
It proposes to wait until the lake rises an additional 6 feet, when 
the benefits would be greater. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving Minnewaukan to higher ground was on the agenda Tuesday  
night when about 250 people from northern North Dakota farming 
communities gathered to discuss contingency plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, everything is an option,'' Mayor Mike Every said.  
``There are no dumb ideas. We're really either one big rainfall 
away or one bad winter away from a disaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moving the town could carry a steep price tag, and bills are  
already mounting for millions of dollars of damage to Minnewaukan's

<HEADLINE> Huizenga Lieutenant Forming Own Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Steven Berrard, right-hand man to  
Wayne Huizenga at AutoNation Inc. and Blockbuster Entertainment, is 
leaving to manage his own investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Huizenga will remain chairman of AutoNation as the nation's  
largest car retailer seeks a new CEO, a title previously shared by 
Huizenga and Berrard, the company said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having accomplished what I set out to do at AutoNation, I am  
ready to take on new opportunities and to do what I enjoy most: 
building companies from the ground up,'' Berrard said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Once his successor is named, Berrard said he will become  
actively involved in New River Capital Partners, his private 
investment firm, and oversee growth companies. He will remain on 
AutoNation's board. 
</P>
<P>
	In three years, Huizenga and Berrard led AutoNation from a  
startup in a previously splintered industry to a retail giant, 
primarily through dealership purchases. The AutoNation empire 
includes new and used cars and National and Alamo rental cars. In 
1998, the company had sales of $17.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Huizenga credited Berrard with creating the auto retail network  
and quickly building it into an industry force. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve and I believe that now is the time to put a new chief  
executive in place to help build shareholder value and unleash 
AutoNation's great potential,'' Huizenga said. 
</P>
<P>
	AutoNation began combining its AutoNation USA used-car stores  
with new-car franchises and putting dealerships under the 
AutoNation name this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of AutoNation traded down 56 1/4 cents to $17.81 3/4 on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Gore Caught in AIDS Activist Rift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's effort to resolve a  
trade dispute over AIDS medicines has landed him in the middle of a 
clash between pharmaceutical firms protecting their patents and 
AIDS activists who want to get cheap, generic drugs to sick South 
Africans. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute has drawn AIDS protesters to Gore's presidential  
campaign outings, where they publicly accuse him of trying to block 
South Africa's access to AIDS drugs. They say they will persist 
until he states a position that satisfies them. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore wrote to the Congressional Black Caucus' chairman last  
week, saying he does not oppose South Africa's attempts to produce 
or obtain generic AIDS medicines as long as those efforts do not 
violate laws protecting patents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want you to know from the start that I support South  
Africa's efforts to enhance health care for its people,'' Gore 
wrote last Friday to Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., who chairs the black 
caucus. ``I support South Africa's effort to provide AIDS drugs at 
reduced prices through compulsory licensing and parallel importing, 
so long as they are carried out in a way that is consistent with 
international agreements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore -- and some black caucus members -- hoped that would resolve  
the misunderstanding over Gore's trade discussions with South 
Africa's then-Vice President Thabo Mbeki, and remove a policy 
dilemma that could haunt Gore's bid for the Democratic presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	But the statement only clouded the situation further.  
</P>
<P>
	``What does that mean?'' asked Dr. Peter Lurie, an activist with  
Public Citizen who has performed AIDS research in South Africa. He 
said if Gore is saying that South Africa's law was inconsistent 
with international law, ``then this letter means absolutely 
nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ACT-UP promised to keep protesting and said it would challenge  
other presidential candidates on the issue too. 
</P>
<P>
	``This statement is smoke and mirrors, said Asia Russell of  
ACT-UP Philadelphia, which amassed 400 protesters outside a Gore 
event Monday. ``Al Gore could do so much more than this statement. 
He could do a lot to clarify the position of the administration in 
terms of reversing policies that are in action now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Donald Payne of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the  
House International Relations Committee's subcommittee on Africa, 
said AIDS activists have chosen the wrong target in Gore. He noted 
that the vice president, by setting up a commission on U.S.-South 
African relations, has brought unprecedented attention to the AIDS 
problem there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not defending him. I'm just talking right over wrong, and  
it's wrong the way they are accusing him,'' said Payne, a previous 
chairman of the black caucus. ``If there are some legal questions 
about development of generic medications and the whole patent 
question, they're beyond the vice president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's letter was prompted by a letter last Thursday from  
Clyburn. He asked Gore to state clearly the position he took with 
Mbeki, now South Africa's president, regarding South Africa's 
Medicines Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Christian-Green, the Virgin Islands' elected delegate to  
Congress, had heard AIDS activists' claims that Gore was helping 
pharmaceutical companies thwart South Africa's efforts to bypass 
U.S. patent laws so it could get AIDS medicines at a lower cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us got a bit concerned. We thought we generally were on  
the same page with him on this issue,'' Clyburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Chris Lahane said, ``This is one of those  
situations where emotions are obscuring what the real information 
is. The vice president supports efforts to provide South Africa 
with AIDS drugs at reduced prices. He's working to create a 
framework to make that happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christian-Green, a family physician for 21 years, said the  
caucus was satisfied with Gore's explanation. ``We would hate to 
have the ACT-UP groups turn voters away from a person who would be 
a good candidate,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa's 1997 law granted the government unspecified power  
to obtain cheaper AIDS drugs for the country where more than 3 
million people are HIV positive and 2.5 million children are 
expected to be orphaned because of the virus over the next 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 pharmaceutical companies worldwide are challenging the  
law in South African courts, fearing it may be used in a way that 
violates patent rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore aides said the misunderstanding began in February after the  
State Department submitted a report on U.S. efforts to get the 
Medicines Act amended. A provision inserted into last year's budget 
required the report as a condition for releasing U.S. aid to South 
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Early Risks for Marrow Recipients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Cancer patients who get bone marrow transplants can live pretty  
close to a normal life if they can make it past the first two 
years, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The risk of dying from a recurrence of the cancer, infection,  
rejection of the transplanted marrow or other causes is highest 
during this period. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of  
Medicine, looked at patients with any of four diseases that are 
sometimes treated with transplants of bone marrow. It found that 
those who are disease-free after two years have only a 1-in-9 
chance of dying over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though the mortality rate is higher than in the normal  
population, it's pretty low,'' said Dr. Mary M. Horowitz, 
scientific director of the International Bone Marrow Transplant 
Registry at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee. ``Every 
day you survive, your chance of making it another day gets 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horowitz and colleagues studied records of 6,691 patients at 221  
transplant centers worldwide. The patients received marrow from a 
donor between 1980 and 1993 and, two years after the transplant, 
were still healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	The patients had one of three types of leukemia or an anemia in  
which the marrow, the blood-forming system inside the bones, wasn't 
working. They received high-dose cancer drugs, and often high-dose 
radiation, to kill their non-functioning marrow. Then they were 
injected with the donated marrow -- essentially getting a new blood 
and immune-cell factory. 
</P>
<P>
	Horowitz said the lingering risk, while slight, shows patients  
need frequent checkups for years after the transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'm hoping is the results will increase the likelihood  
that some of these patients will (be able to) get health and life 
insurance after their transplants,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Andrew Pecora, chief of the Blood and Marrow Stem Cell  
Transplant Program at Hackensack University Medical Center in New 
Jersey, said the encouraging results confirm what specialists 
suspected. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the study may help doctors save patients by pushing them  
to eat better, take vitamins, exercise and quit smoking.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Charged With Racist Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A lawsuit accuses Microsoft of including a  
``racially-charged'' message linking black people to monkeys in its 
Publisher 1998 software. The company has agreed to alter the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	John Elijah, 32, filed the suit Tuesday in San Diego federal  
court, claiming users will see images that include a black couple 
sitting on monkey bars when they type ``monkey'' to access pictures 
of the animal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt the blood rushing out of my whole body,'' said Elijah,  
a black construction worker who was shown the image by a co-worker. 
``I was humiliated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Greg Shaw said the company already has  
offered a software update to anyone who requests it. He said the 
Publisher 2000 software itself does not contain the image. 
</P>
<P>
	``We regret any offense or inconvenience,'' Shaw said. ``We are  
deeply committed to doing everything possible to prevent this in 
the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elijah is demanding that Microsoft pay $75,000 in damages and  
alter the software, which is used to create newsletters and 
documents with graphics and pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	Elijah's attorney, Harvey Levine, is seeking approval of a class  
action lawsuit for the estimated 4 million customers who bought the 
software. 
</P>
<P>
	Levine suspects the picture was specifically programmed to  
appear as ``some sort of sick insider joke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Shaw said the link was unintentional. He said the software  
contains images that can be accessed by using several key words. A 
computer user who searched for ``couple'' may have accessed the 
photo as well as someone who typed ``bar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, ``monkey'' brings up an assortment of pictures  
including monkeys in trees, a gorilla and the closely-cropped photo 
of the black couple. 
</P>
<P>
	Elijah, who is married and has two children, said his wife was  
extremely upset over the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her biggest fear is that maybe skinheads or people like that  
will face off with me,'' he said. ``She's afraid people will think 
I'm doing this for the money, and not because I want it fixed.''

<HEADLINE> Coyotes Move To Keep Tocchet, Adams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Phoenix Coyotes said they will  
exercise the option years on contracts for forwards Rick Tocchet 
and Greg Adams for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday was the deadline for such moves.  
</P>
<P>
	``Those guys are good players,'' general manager Bobby Smith  
told The Arizona Republic. ``We feel that each has at least another 
year in them. They were big parts of our team last year, and we 
expect it from them again next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tocchet, a solid locker room leader, was the team's  
fourth-leading scorer last season with 26 goals and 56 points. He 
is scheduled to make $2.15 million next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams, fifth with 19 goals and 43 points, will get $1.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Tocchet, 35, played in 81 of the team's 82 regular-season games.  
Adams, who will turn 36 in August, played in 75 but missed four of 
seven playoff games with a groin injury.

<HEADLINE> Photo Show Highlights U.S.,Soviets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American and Soviet citizens led vastly  
different lives in the 1930s, but they shared many hardships and 
experiences -- resemblances highlighted in a new show at the 
Washington's Corcoran Gallery of Art. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Josef Stalin's Communist dictatorship and President  
Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal sent out photographers to record 
their propaganda and their people's dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the results are on view come Saturday at the Corcoran.  
</P>
<P>
	``They danced, and we danced,'' wrote Leah Bendavid-Val, the  
American who put the pictures together. ``They built dams and steel 
mills, planted and harvested and went hungry, nursed their 
children, and so did we.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the New Deal drive to lift the country out of the  
Great Depression, photographers were sent out and came back with 
pictures showing just how depressed much of the country was. 
</P>
<P>
	And Soviet photographers snapped shots that belied Kremlin  
propaganda about communism's ``workers' paradise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dorothea Lange took one of the most famous of the American  
photos, a sad migrant farm woman in Nipomo, Calif., nursing a large 
baby. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seven hungry children, mother aged 32,'' said the  
photographer's note. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bendavid-Val found a matching photo taken by Arkady  
Shaikhet, who worked for official Soviet publications, on a farm 
near a village outside Moscow. There is no indication that either 
photographer suspected the other's existence. 
</P>
<P>
	Other images reflect more optimism -- a couple sitting around a  
monumental 1939 radio in a house they were buying on the 
installment plan in Hidalgo County, Texas, and an ecstatic young 
tuba player in Moscow's Red Square. 
</P>
<P>
	``Underlying the photographs in both countries were the firmly  
held beliefs that hard, consuming work was not demeaning but 
elevating, that machines meant progress, and that government public 
works could make people's lives better,'' Ms. Bendavid-Val said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in her catalogue is a warning from Librarian of Congress  
James H. Billington, an expert on the Soviet Union. The library 
cooperated on the collection, and organizers hope it will be shown 
in Russia as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``The USSR was using photography to create Utopian hopes that  
masked massive repression that verged on governmental genocide 
against large numbers of its own people,'' Billington wrote. ``The 
U.S.A. was trying to rediscover its better self in the wake of an 
economic depression by commissioning artists to depict the real 
face of their country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Photography, however, shows only carefully chosen slices of  
reality, and it can conceal as well as reveal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Propaganda and Dreams: Photographing the 1930s in the USSR and  
the US'' will be at the Corcoran Gallery of Art through Oct. 3. The 
gallery suggests a donation of $3 from adults, $1 from older people 
and students, $5 for groups of any size.

<HEADLINE> Prayer-Recommending Bill Fails House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After suffering a narrow defeat, supporters  
said they'll try again to win House passage of a resolution calling 
for Americans to observe a national day of prayer and fasting in 
response to recent violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite calls for public repentance, reconciliation and moral  
uplift through prayer, Rep. Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho, failed to win 
the two-thirds majority needed for passage yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-thirds majority is needed when legislation is considered  
under special rules designed to speed passage of noncontroversial 
bills through the House. The bill failed when 275 voted for it, 140 
were opposed and 11 members voted ``present.'' The margin was nine 
votes short of two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
	Chenoweth said she was not disappointed. ``A strong majority of  
the House of Representatives supported this measure, and that's 
good news,'' she said. Chenoweth plans to reintroduce the bill 
under regular rules, which require only a simple majority, perhaps 
as early as today, spokesman Kyle Key said. ``This won't be the end 
of it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution was the latest in a string of religion-related  
measures that have been debated in the House. Last week, the House 
passed a measure permitting the posting of the Ten Commandments at 
schools and other state-run facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our nation is sick and hurting and now is the time when all  
Americans of faith must come together and pray for healing and a 
spiritual renewal,'' Chenoweth said from the House floor Tuesday. 
``If there ever is a time when we need almighty God, it is now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She cited several recent events, including the high school  
shooting in Littleton, Colo., in explaining the bill. She said it 
could lead to a turning away from violence and a healing of 
cultural division. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are witnessing with increasing regularity with the effects  
of violence and murder a disregard for life and exploitation of 
children ... the breakdown of the family, and, as we know, a 
general moral decay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Texas, spoke some of the sharpest words in  
opposition, saying the measure was unconstitutional and morally 
wrong. Congress has no business telling Americans when to pray and 
member of Congress should not use God to further their political 
agenda, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards said he believed that faith and prayer could improve the  
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, in reflecting upon the debates in this House of  
recent days, I would suggest that we members of Congress should 
spend more time praying and less time telling others how to pray,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chenoweth accused Edwards of misunderstanding the bill, saying  
it simply recommends prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	The advocacy group Americans United for Separation of Church and  
State spoke out against the Chenoweth bill and earlier measures, 
saying Americans already know how to pray. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our nation faces serious problems, but all the House can offer  
are pious platitudes and meaningless resolutions,'' said the Rev. 
Barry W. Lynn, the group's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	The House also passed three other religion-related measures this  
month, including one that would allow the government to provide tax 
dollars to religious groups offering social services, including 
drug treatment programs.

<HEADLINE> Barak Ready To Form Israel Govt. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak formally  
announced his intention today to present a government by next week, 
having secured enough legislators to push forward his plans to 
revive the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak's letter to Shimon Peres, the acting speaker of the  
Knesset, ends more than 40 days of negotiations during which Barak 
appeared to veer toward, then away from a peace coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	The letters says Barak ``will go before the Knesset to present  
the ministers and announce the division of roles and the basic 
laws'' next week. The date was not announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The final makeup of the coalition became clear earlier this  
week, when talks between Barak and the hard-line Likud party broke 
down. Barak then accelerated talks with parties that backed his 
plans to revive talks with the Palestinians and Syria, frozen by 
the outgoing Likud-led government. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak had until Friday morning to deliver his letter of intent  
to Peres. He has until midnight July 8 to present his government to 
parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak secured support from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party this  
evening, promising the party four major ministries: Labor, Health, 
Religions and Infrastructure. Shas played a leading role in the 
outgoing hard-line government, but its spiritual leader, Rabbi 
Ovadia Yosef, considers ceding territory for peace acceptable as a 
religious imperative. 
</P>
<P>
	Shas' 17 seats brings Barak's coalition to 59 out of 120 seats.  
Ten legislators from Arab-backed parties have pledged to support 
Barak and his peace policies from outside his coalition. Barak 
regards the differences between himself and the Arab-backed parties 
as too wide to bring them into the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes of 69 legislators allows Barak to present a viable  
minority government, even if he fails to secure more partners. But 
a 10-seat liberal secular party, Meretz, is likely to sign by 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks with two other parties backing a revival of the peace  
process are in trouble over the allocation of Cabinet seats. The 
Central party is an assemblage of six defectors from other parties; 
the two-seat Am Ehad is a workers' rights party. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if their differences are not worked out by next week, both  
parties will likely vote for Barak's peace moves from outside the 
coalition. That gives Barak a solid 87 peace process-backing votes 
out of 120. 
</P>
<P>
	Shas signed the letter this evening after achieving a compromise  
with another coalition party, the National Religious Party, over 
sharing control of the Religions Ministry, Israel and army radios 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meretz is holding out for promises that Shas, a leading member  
of the outgoing government, will have its power and influence cut 
in the new coalition. Shas' last-minute willingness to give up its 
longtime control of the Interior Ministry will likely persuade 
Meretz to come aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak has said he wants as broad a coalition as possible to lend  
weight to his peace initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	All but one of the incoming parties back Barak's pledge to  
revive peace talks with Palestinians and Syrians frozen by 
government led by Benjamin Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Religious Party, the party closest to Jewish  
settlers in disputed areas, is uncomfortable with reviving the 
peace process, but will likely moderate its tone in exchange for 
maintaining influence in the Religions and Education Ministries.

	Both quarters include restructuring charges. Excluding the  
charges, Nike earned $108.5 million, or 38 cents a share for the 
quarter, compared to earnings of $11.8 million, or 4 cents a share 
in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had projected  
earnings of 37 cents a share, excluding the charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the period were $2.18 billion, down 5 percent from  
$2.31 billion for the same period a year ago. For the year, Nike 
had revenues of $8.8 billion, down 8 percent from $9.6 billion in 
fiscal 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Annual earnings were $451.4 million, or $1.57 per share, a 3  
percent decline from 1998, when Nike had profits of $479.1 million, 
or $1.62 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fiscal 1999 was a year of hard work and strategic realignment  
for us at Nike,'' said Chairman Phil Knight, who had been 
optimistic about renewed growth after a strong third quarter but 
had pointed to warning signs, such as sluggish clothing sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``The road to that growth will be a more challenging one than  
we've faced in the past,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 fiscal year marked a number of changes for Nike.  
</P>
<P>
	The company slashed costs, continued layoffs and reduced  
inventory throughout the year to help recover from a steep decline 
in fiscal 1998 due mainly to the Asian recession. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Nike's most visible celebrity athlete endorsers retired,  
as Michael Jordan left the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all the news was bad. A San Francisco-labor rights group,  
Global Exchange, praised the company for its work to improve 
factory conditions in Vietnam after severely criticizing Nike for 
years, while a California judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by a 
consumer advocate on behalf of Nike customers in the entire state. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings were released after financial markets had closed.  
Shares of Nike fell 75 cents to $63.37 1/2 in trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Lighthouse Moving Away from Ocean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUXTON, N.C. (AP) -- The nation's tallest lighthouse has covered  
half of its 2,900-foot journey away from the Atlantic surf in under 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers using hydraulic jacks pushed the Cape Hatteras  
Lighthouse 288 1/2 feet along its course yesterday -- nearly one-tenth 
the total distance and the most in a day since the beacon began to 
roll June 17. Officials estimated at the start of the move that the 
lighthouse would travel 25 to 100 feet per day. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's journey sent the black-and-white, candy-striped beacon  
past the 1,450-foot mark of its trip. 
</P>
<P>
	While it's moving 2,900 feet, it will wind up sitting 1,600 feet  
from the Atlantic Ocean because of the curves in the shoreline. The 
208-foot lighthouse should reach its destination by the middle of 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be there right on schedule,'' project manager Skellie  
Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lighthouse was considered to have been most vulnerable to  
hurricanes and other severe weather during the initial 850 feet of 
its move.

<HEADLINE> Panel Questions IRS Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service should not rely  
heavily on customer surveys to determine whether it is doing a good 
job because they can be easily skewed to make the tax agency look 
good, an independent advisory group said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti says such opinion surveys  
are critical in finding from real people if the agency is actually 
becoming more taxpayer-friendly and serving people better, instead 
of just relying on numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to try to use surveys, but not exclusively,''  
Rossotti told the 14-member IRS Advisory Council, made up of 
accountants, tax lawyers, business people and other private 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report on the progress of IRS reforms, the council said the  
agency's plans to use such ``snapshot surveys'' to help evaluate 
its employees ``are inherently unreliable'' and that it would be 
better to concentrate on measurable results such as how long 
workers take to resolve cases and how telephone calls are handled. 
</P>
<P>
	``We urge that the IRS consider measuring customer service  
through regular monitoring of performance, rather than through use 
of customer surveys,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayer satisfaction surveys are among the new ways of  
measuring employee performance as the IRS moves away from its 
reliance on the amount of tax dollars collected. The new 
measurements also include employee satisfaction and business 
results, such as the number of cases closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Wenzel, the deputy IRS commissioner, told the advisory  
council that the new performance measures are part of ``a clear, 
clear message that's being communicated in terms of our commitment 
to public service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The advisory panel also recommended that the IRS measure the  
success of audits on whether they ``focus on issues that make a 
real difference'' instead of small items that take too much time to 
resolve. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the panel raised other specific concerns about the IRS  
reforms, overall its report praised the agency for moving ahead 
quickly and urged that Congress provide enough money to continue 
the job, particularly for new technology and better training. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a change in culture,'' said Jim Flagg, the  
panel's chairman, who is a tax aid coordinator for the American 
Association of Retired Persons in San Antonio. ``The word has 
gotten down through your organization: 'We're looking to help you, 
not give you a black eye.'''

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted in Deadly Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A man upset that his wife would not  
agree to a divorce was convicted Wednesday of first degree murder 
for setting a fire that killed her and his six children. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorjik Avanesian, 43, poured gasoline on a towel, lit it and  
tossed it into a room where his children ages 4 to 17, and 
37-year-old wife slept in their Glendale apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Avanesian set the 1996 fire because his wife  
refused to divorce him. Avanesian was found guilty of seven counts 
of first-degree murder and arson, and could face the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty phase of the trial was scheduled to begin next week.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers argued their client was ``delusional'' and  
feared his family was tainted by drugs. The family of immigrants 
from Iran moved to Glendale about nine months before the fire.

<HEADLINE> Cubans' Arrival Generates Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A desperate bid by six Cubans to reach  
shore generated a melee early Wednesday that included a mayor 
throwing punches, and resulted in a Coast Guard inquiry into its 
own behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Under U.S. policy, foreigners who reach U.S. shores are allowed  
to seek asylum, while those intercepted at sea are generally kept 
out of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy has aggravated tensions in recent weeks with Cuban  
boats arriving in South Florida at least weekly and the pace of 
interceptions picking up. 
</P>
<P>
	On live television on Tuesday, Coast Guard crews were shown  
showering the Cubans with water hoses after they had jumped out of 
a boat. Two of the Cubans made it to shore. Four others were nabbed 
in the water. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the four refugees caught offshore could have been  
immediately returned to Cuba, they and the other two were allowed 
Wednesday to stay with family members while awaiting a ruling on 
their status. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident sent Cuban supporters to the streets and stalled  
evening rush-hour traffic Tuesday on two major highways before U.S. 
authorities offered to consider asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, dozens of people gathered at an Immigration and  
Naturalization Service center as an official announced Washington 
would decide the fate of the six refugees ranging in age from 17 to 
36. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of one demonstration, Hialeah Mayor Raul Martinez was  
standing at a police line when he was caught on camera arguing with 
protesters. He grabbed a man and pounded him several times on the 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a group of individuals here that were agitated. They  
didn't care about those six individuals. They were here just to 
make trouble,'' Martinez told WSVN-TV. ``They were not willing to 
listen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., said Coast Guard Commandant  
James Loy promised ``a full, serious and prompt investigation'' of 
the agency's actions on the water. Water hoses have been used in 
the past, but they are not common practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Border Patrol is questioning whether the six refugees  
found Tuesday made it to south Florida on their own or whether they 
were smuggled in and left just offshore to finish the trip on their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees, found in a 14-foot rowboat, had no splinters,  
calluses, or signs of dehydration or overexposure, said Keith 
Robert, assistant chief of the Border Patrol in Miami.

<HEADLINE> Tide Turns Against Fishermen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- In a fisherman's world, it's typically like  
father, like son. 
</P>
<P>
	But these days, it's getting harder to pull a living from the  
sea, and many fishermen hope their kids won't follow their 
footsteps. Nor do their wives, who have gone so far as to launch a 
mentoring program to show their children a different path. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so unstable that you do not encourage young children to  
get involved because they will have no security into the future,'' 
said Angela Sanfilippo, who descends from seven generations of 
fishermen and is married to one. ``What are these kids going to do? 
Where could they go?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, as president of the Gloucester Fishermen's Wives  
Association, Sanfilippo helped start a program that gave children 
of fishermen in this sea-dependent community glimpses of other 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
	With small grants here and there over the years, the group has  
been able to offer part-time and summer minimum-wage jobs to a 
total of about 30 fishermen's children. The teen-agers worked for 
the U.S. Coast Guard and in local hospitals, guided by volunteer 
mentors. 
</P>
<P>
	The program is now expanding, thanks to a $100,000 grant  
announced this week from the U.S. Department of Labor. The 
Fishermen's Project will be managed by the nonprofit Corporation 
for Business, Work and Learning in three hard-hit fishing 
communities: Gloucester, New Bedford and Hyannis. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past few years, CBWL has helped retrain some 700  
fishermen into jobs ranging from computer repairman to diesel 
mechanic, said Sanfilippo, who helps run the agency's Gloucester 
job retraining center. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanfilippo's 53-year-old husband, John, has been fishing since  
he was a small boy and comes from a long line of fisherman in his 
native Sicily. 
</P>
<P>
	Their 28-year-old son, Dominic, loved the ocean so much he quit  
law school after two years to join his father at sea. This winter, 
however, he gave up fishing, finding it impossible to eke out a 
living. He now works in construction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is sad, not only because he will not carry on the tradition  
but because I know that he loved fishing,'' his mother said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A loss of resources and tightened federal fishing restrictions  
have forced thousands of New England fishermen to sell their boats. 
For many, fishing was the only life they knew. 
</P>
<P>
	Even working 12- to 15-hour days, independent fishermen struggle  
to make anywhere from $20,000 to $40,000 in a good year, Sanfilippo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fishing families like hers want their children to have  
employment options, although they are encouraging them to look at 
other ocean-related careers -- harbor master, for example, or marine 
scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dream is that the children will learn other things and  
come back to the community and put to action some of the things 
that they learned so we can bring our industry to the 21st 
century,'' Sanfilippo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department grant won't go very far; organizers expect  
to place only about two dozen high school students in the fall, but 
hope to extend the program beyond its one-year funding. 
</P>
<P>
	How many fishermen's children are actually out there is  
difficult to pinpoint -- certainly hundreds in the three fishing 
communities -- and organizers say they are trying to spread the 
word. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominic Taormina's father, uncle and grandfather are all  
fishermen -- but none of the men want him to follow their lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Taormina said he wants to be a history teacher or an anchor on  
sports television shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``They definitely don't want me to be a fishermen,'' said the  
16-year-old Gloucester boy, who participated in the program working 
for the Coast Guard last year when he was a high school freshman. 
``They want me to go to school and learn as much as I can.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't. Egg-Safety Efforts Hampered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Too many federal agencies are doing too  
little, too slowly to protect Americans from being sickened by 
salmonella-contaminated eggs, a new report concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	Raw or undercooked eggs -- found in thick-cut French toast,  
Caesar salad, homemade ice cream, unbaked cookie dough and other 
American favorites -- are among the most common sources of 
salmonella. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office report, obtained Tuesday by The  
Associated Press, concludes that more consistent oversight is 
needed to bring eggs safely from the chicken to the table. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the problems found by Congress' investigative arm were  
that: 
</P>
<P>
	--Despite support from large egg producers, state agencies and  
others, the federal government has yet to fully develop a 
food-safety inspection system for egg farms and processing plants 
that is based on scientific testing rather than visual inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	--A new federal egg refrigeration requirement, to take effect in  
August -- eight years after it was mandated by Congress -- sets a 
temperature that may not be cool enough to be as effective as 
possible. Also, the rules only cover the eggs from packing until 
they reach retail locations, but not what happens on store shelves 
or in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Food and Drug Administration and the Food Safety and  
Inspection Service have not agreed on a comprehensive approach to 
egg safety, although a 1992 GAO report said a plan was needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``With responsibilities distributed among four federal agencies,  
the nation's egg safety efforts lack an organizational focus and 
contain gaps, inconsistencies and inefficiencies,'' the researchers 
wrote. ``Progress on developing a comprehensive egg safety strategy 
has been slow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report plays neatly into the hands of Sen. Dick Durbin,  
D-Ill., who requested the study. Durbin, consumer groups and others 
on Capitol Hill have been pushing to consolidate the federal 
government's fragmented food-safety system. Food inspection and 
safety enforcement currently is divided mainly among the 
Agriculture Department, Commerce Department, FDA and Environmental 
Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have done very little to meet their statutory  
responsibility with respect to egg safety,'' Durbin said. ``It is 
impossible to explain or defend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Durbin plans to present the GAO report at a Senate Government  
Affairs subcommittee Thursday. He later intends to introduce 
legislation to consolidate all egg safety responsibility within 
USDA, require expiration dates and warning labels on eggs, prohibit 
the repackaging of old eggs and require a science-based inspection 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to the report, USDA and FDA said the positive things  
they have done, which have resulted in declining incidences of 
salmonella from eggs, were ignored by the GAO. But both agencies 
generally agreed with the GAO's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The USDA and FDA have been working together for many years on  
a coordinated approach to the problem of salmonella enteritidis in 
eggs,'' they said in separate letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently released data from the Centers for Disease Control and  
Prevention in Atlanta found a 44 percent decline in the number of 
salmonella cases from contaminated eggs in selected cities and 
states between 1996 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. David Swerdlow, a CDC epidemiologist, attributed the  
progress to better controls at the farm and during transport, as 
well as to increased public awareness. But he said it is still an 
important public health concern. 
</P>
<P>
	From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, egg-linked salmonella went  
from making up 6 percent of all salmonella cases to 23 percent, he 
said. In 1997, salmonella enteritidis appeared to have sickened 
300,000 and caused at least 115 deaths.

<HEADLINE> McCain Challenges on Campaign Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEDFORD, N.H. (AP) -- Invoking the name of Ronald Reagan, Sen.  
John McCain charged Wednesday that lawmakers of his own party were 
willing to sacrifice the conservative agenda of tax cuts and 
smaller government in order to please big contributors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential candidate, the lead sponsor of  
campaign finance reform in the Senate, said Congress was more 
interested in providing pork-barrel projects and tax loopholes for 
campaign contributors than cutting taxes and spending. For example, 
he said, eliminating subsidies for ethanol and oil and gas would 
provide enough money to give students in large school districts 
taxpayer-financed vouchers to allow them to attend private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most Republicans are outraged when our party abandons  
the fight to reform government, to make it smaller and less removed 
in style and substance from the people it serves,'' McCain told 
more than 200 cheering supporters, who filled the top floor of the 
two-story Bedford Town Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most Republicans are outraged when their leaders give up the  
fight that Ronald Reagan led in order to preserve a financial 
advantage over the Democrats,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also criticized the fund-raising practices of President  
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore as he attempted to insert the 
issue of campaign finance reform into the race for the 2000 
Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been told that there is no room for this issue in  
Republican primaries. I intend to make room for it,'' the Arizona 
Republican declared. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's legislation would ban soft money, donations from  
unions, corporations and individuals that do not fall under federal 
contribution limits. The bill died in the last session of Congress, 
but he said he would renew his push for the legislation in the 
coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he said he plans to raise the issue throughout  
his presidential campaign. He has set up a new web site to generate 
grass-roots support for changing the campaign finance laws and 
force the issue onto the political agenda. And he invoked Reagan's 
name a second time as he urged his supporters to pressure the 
GOP-led Congress to pass his bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask every Republican voter to let my colleagues know that  
you still believe in the cause Ronald Reagan fought for, the cause 
you elected a Republican Congress to serve, the cause of less 
government and more freedom,'' McCain said. ``That cause should not 
be sacrificed for one more hour to preserve a campaign system that 
values money above principles and integrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of McCain's rivals for the Republican nomination, Sen. Bob  
Smith of New Hampshire, said the amount of campaign contributions 
wasn't a problem and the federal government shouldn't limit them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way to minimize corruption in the government and in the  
electoral process is to return the power back to the individual, 
not give the government more control over people's money,'' Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain clearly is hoping that campaign finance reform is an  
issue that will catch on among independent-minded New Hampshire 
primary voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people are feeling cynical or disenchanted with  
government today,'' said state Rep. Kathleen Flora, a Republican 
who represents Bedford, N.H. ``Our young people especially feel 
that they don't have a voice. They feel the special interests 
rule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the very least, raising the issue should help McCain burnish  
his reputation as a ``standup guy,'' said Maurice Carroll, head of 
the Hamden, Conn.-based Quinnipiac College Polling Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a guy who says what he thinks, who isn't afraid to take  
unpopular stands, who isn't afraid to take on an issue that is 
unpopular with other politicians,'' Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's New Hampshire campaign chairman, New Hampshire  
Executive Councilor Peter Spaulding, said hundreds wouldn't turn 
out to hear a speech on campaign finance reform if they weren't 
interested in the topic. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can get a crowd like this on a hot day at noon, I have an  
issue that has some legs to it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Raises $200K at Fund-Raiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- As a basketball player for the New York Knicks,  
Bill Bradley wasn't a popular figure in this sports-crazy home of 
the arch-rival Celtics. But as a Democratic candidate for 
president, Bradley attracted more than 200 supporters at a 
fund-raiser here, swelling his campaign coffers by $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Helping to pave the way was a legendary Celtic, John Havlicek,  
who played against Bradley on the basketball court but is now on 
the same campaign team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him years ago, if he ever does it, I'll be there,''  
Havlicek said. ``Bill's been a friend for a long time. We had a lot 
of respect for each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As they waited to hear from Bradley, Havlicek and other  
speakers, the supporters, who had paid $1,000 apiece, dined on 
carved roast beef and turkey, tortellini and ziti. For dessert, 
there were skewers of melon cubes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley drew his loudest applause when he reiterated his call  
for registering handguns and banning cheap Saturday Night Specials. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going out and telling people what I believe and let the  
chips fall where they may,'' he said. ``For example, I think it's 
time someone takes on the National Rifle Association.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also delivered an indirect criticism of President Clinton  
without mentioning him by name, saying trust in the president 
``must be repaired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he talked about the ``politics of plenty,'' as he described  
the current booming economy and federal budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	What should be done with some of that money? ``We can make sure  
more people have health care,'' he said, ``and children who are 
poor can be brought out of poverty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's Boston fund-raiser ended a day that began with him  
visiting two community groups in Concord, N.H., and then receiving 
the endorsement of more than a dozen New Hampshire Democratic state 
legislators.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Duke's record-tying team of 1999 made history  
one more time Wednesday night when four players from the NCAA 
tournament runnerup were selected in the first round of the NBA 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Elton Brand, Trajan Langdon, Corey Maggette and William Avery  
were selected in the first 14 picks of the draft, the first time 
four players from the same school have been selected in the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago chose the 6-foot-8 Brand as the first overall pick,  
adding to the Bulls' rebuilding efforts in the post-Michael Jordan 
era. 
</P>
<P>
	As a sophomore, Brand averaged 16.2 points and 9.8 rebounds to  
lead the Blue Devils to a 19-0 Atlantic Coast Conference record and 
an appearance in the NCAA championship game. The Blue Devils also 
tied a school and national record by winning 37 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a lot of pressure, especially being the No. 1  
pick,'' said Brand, who left Duke with two years' eligibility 
remaining. ``I've just got to face it like I've faced it at every 
level. I'm going to work hard and do my best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Langdon was perhaps the surprise pick among four Blue Devils,  
picked by Cleveland as the 11th pick and before Maggette and Avery. 
Many draft experts believe the 6-3 guard would be picked late in 
the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Langdon, a three-time all-ACC selection, scored 1,974 points in  
his career, a 14.5 average. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Krzyzewski said before the draft that Langdon was the  
one most ready for the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	``He should be a longtime NBA player,'' Krzyzewski said. ``He's  
solid. There is very little variance in his game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski disagreed with the decision by underclassmen Maggette  
and Avery, chosen 13th and 14th respectively, to leave early for 
the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggette, a 6-6 freshman who came off the bench last season, was  
picked by Seattle and Minnesota took the sophomore Avery. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggette averaged 17 minutes, 10.6 points and nearly four  
rebounds a game, earning a spot on the ACC all-rookie team. Draft 
scouts considered his athletic ability an asset but said he needed 
to learn more about playing the pro game. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery was called by one NBA general manager one of the best pure  
long-distance shooters of the point guards available in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery was a second team all-conference selection last season,  
averaging nearly 15 points and five assists per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll have to learn more about running a team while he uses  
his skills,'' Krzyzewski said before the draft. ``Our team was an 
easier team to run. That will be his biggest thing he has to learn 
while still trying to hit his shot.''

<HEADLINE> Magic Trade Grant for Maggette </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The Orlando Magic began a major overhaul of  
their roster Wednesday night when they traded forward Horace Grant 
to the Seattle SuperSonics for the draft rights to Corey Maggette. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggette, who left Duke after his freshman season, was  
considered one of the best athletes available in this year's draft. 
He was the 13th pick by the Sonics, however the Magic feels he has 
the potential to be a player they can build around. 
</P>
<P>
	``Potential is scary,'' coach Doc Rivers said. ``It's just  
potential, but we like that potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant averaged 8.9 points and seven rebounds this season, his  
fifth in Orlando. He spent seven years in Chicago, helping the 
Bulls win three NBA championships, before signing with the Magic as 
a free agent in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggette, 19, averaged 10.6 points in 39 games at Duke and was  
named to the Atlantic Coast Conference All-Rookie team. The Magic 
began the night without a first-round and were resigned to being 
content with selecting 38th overall until Maggette was still 
available for Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason he slipped, we don't care,'' Rivers said. ``We know  
everybody had had rated in the top five at one time, and we still 
believe he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make the deal work under salary cap rules, the Magic also  
obtained veterans Dale Ellis, Billy Owens and Don MacLean, who may 
or may not fit into the team's future. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Grant, Seattle received second-round draft picks  
in 2000 and 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The reshaping of the roster continued with the selection of  
Maryland's Laron Profit with the ninth pick in the second round, 
No. 38 overall. The Magic later obtained Michigan's Louis Bullock, 
a point guard selected by the Minnesota Timberwolves with the 42nd 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Profit shot 50 percent from the field and averaged 14.5 points  
per game as a senior at Maryland, helping the Terrapins reached the 
round of 16 in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock averaged 20.7 points last season and is projected as a  
backup for Darrell Armstrong, who finished the year as Orlando's 
starting point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of what general manager John Gabriel does the rest of the  
summer depends on what happens with four-time All-Star Penny 
Hardaway, who becomes a free agent on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers reiterated that the club hopes to re-sign Hardaway and  
keep him in Orlando, even though the sixth-year pro said shortly 
after the playoffs that he felt under appreciated and was prepared 
to move on. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway apologized for the comments the following day.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ad Spending Expected To Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. advertising spending will rise 6.1 percent  
this year, the industry's best-known forecaster said Wednesday as 
he raised his earlier estimate of a 5.5 percent expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Coen, senior vice president for the ad agency  
McCann-Erickson Worldwide, said the economy has grown more rapidly 
than had been expected when he offered the lower estimate six 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have a pretty good year for the advertising industry,''  
Coen said as he presented his latest semiannual ad spending 
forecast. He has been tracking trends in ad spending for nearly 50 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first estimate of spending in the year 2000, Coen expects  
7.5 percent growth next year as the presidential and congressional 
elections result in more advertising at the same time that 
marketers are trying to capitalize on the millennium and the Summer 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The growth expected this year is down from 7.5 percent in 1998  
and would be the slowest since a 5.2 percent rise in 1993. But Coen 
said ad spending has been stronger than anticipated for what he 
called a ``hammock'' year when growth was expected to subside 
between the 1998 Winter Olympics-election year and the 2000 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. ad spending is expected to rise to $213.95 billion in 1999  
and reach $230 billion in 2000, Coen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in the growth estimate for this year was divided  
nearly evenly between national and local advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	National ad spending is expected to rise 6.4 percent, up from  
Coen's December estimate of 6.0 percent growth. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the four major broadcast TV networks should see ad  
revenue rise 7 percent this year, much faster than the 4 percent 
growth he expected in December. The recent advance sales of network 
TV ad time for the fall season was considered exceptionally strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Coen said national advertisers are expected to boost spending by  
9 percent on radio and 6.5 percent on magazines and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among major advertising categories, drug advertisers posted the  
biggest spending gains on TV and in magazines in the first quarter 
with a 21 percent increase while movie ad spending was up 11 
percent. Telecommunications and computer companies boosted ad 
spending in early 1999 by 26 percent and 23 percent respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Coen expects local ad spending will be up 5.7 percent this year,  
up from his earlier forecast of 5.0 percent growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio is experiencing the biggest surge in local ad spending, as  
its growth is expected to reach 9 percent this year vs. earlier 
projection of 6 percent growth. Coen said price increases account 
for most of the increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Local ad spending is expected to rise 5 percent in newspapers,  
on television and in the Yellow Pages. 
</P>
<P>
	Coen said his figures include a mid-range estimate of about $1  
billion in ad spending on the Internet. But he is skeptical about 
the figure because of the difficulty in measuring it. He said he 
suspects the amount of advertising in weekly newspapers and 
shopping guides and at in-store displays each probably exceed that 
on the Internet several times over. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas advertising is expected to rise 4.1 percent to $212  
billion this year following a 3.0 percent decline last year, Coen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He expects 5.7 percent growth in overseas ad spending in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin To Head Gas Monopoly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The president's envoy in the Kosovo conflict and  
longtime political ally, Viktor Chernomyrdin, today was elected to 
chair Russia's largest company, natural gas monopoly Gazprom. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, whose exports last year totaled $10.4 billion, is a  
key source of cash for the government, accounting for one-fifth of 
tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin, 61, is the second Yeltsin supporter in five days  
to be installed at the head of a major Russian company. On Friday, 
presidential chief of staff Alexander Voloshin was elected chairman 
of the board for the electricity monopoly, Unified Energy Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin was Gazprom's chief executive officer before  
joining the Cabinet in 1992, after which he spent five years as 
President Boris Yeltsin's prime minister. He was dismissed abruptly 
for failing to right the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin brought Chernomyrdin back into the political arena as  
Russia's special envoy for the Kosovo settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the board of directors' vote today, media speculated that  
the appointment of Chernomyrdin would indicate the Kremlin's desire 
to tighten control over Gazprom before parliamentary elections in 
December and the presidential vote in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Gazprom could play a key role because leadership is likely to  
contribute company money to campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``The presidential office is concerned that Gazprom money may  
help fund election campaigns of political forces alien to Boris 
Yeltsin,'' the business daily Kommersant said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian media predicted Chernomyrdin would use his vote at  
Gazprom to try to push current CEO Rem Vyakhirev to the sidelines 
and put the company under Kremlin control. Vyakhirev and the 
Kremlin have long been at odds over key issues, such as the 
company's payment of overdue taxes and deliveries to government 
budget organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin also leads the Our Home Is Russia political  
movement, which has the second-largest faction in the lower house 
of Russian parliament. He has said he may run for president, though 
his chances look extremely slim.

<HEADLINE> Audit: Livermore Lab's Security Lax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Energy Department audit found continued  
weaknesses in computer security and lax safeguards against outside 
physical attacks at the Livermore nuclear weapons lab in 
California, department officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The review, conducted by a special oversight team at the  
direction of Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, found that some 
sensitive information continued to be at risk, despite increased 
attention to security measures at the lab. 
</P>
<P>
	The Livermore National Laboratory is one of three nuclear  
weapons facilities that have been under intense scrutiny amid the 
uproar over alleged Chinese espionage and security lapses involving 
the Los Alamos lab. 
</P>
<P>
	The special review, conducted in late April and early May, found  
that at Livermore, outside foreign nationals were able to dial into 
the lab's unclassified computer, and programs to monitor electronic 
mail had not been fully implemented, according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The review also found that the lab's security forces did not  
have an adequate plan to counter potential attacks by terrorists, 
said the officials who spoke on the condition of not being further 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Reaction time for a possible attack was at times slow and not  
all ``pathways'' for physical access were covered, said the 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	The classified report is to be presented to a closed hearing of  
the House Commerce Committee Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Podonsky, who headed the investigation, said he would not  
characterize the security shortcomings as ``critical'' but ones 
that needed to be corrected. He said that lab officials began 
immediately to make improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not classify ... (the problems) as critical,'' said  
Podonsky in an interview. ``How serious is the vulnerability? Was 
nuclear material at risk? No. Was classified information at risk? 
No. Was there sensitive information that needed to be protected? 
Yes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's serious because from our standpoint it needed to be  
corrected. These are holes that need to be plugged.''

<HEADLINE> Internet Defamation Suit Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- A judge has dismissed a defamation  
lawsuit filed against an America Online user by a judge in 
Pennsylvania, in a case the American Civil Liberties Union said had 
important free speech implications. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pennsylvania jurist, Allegheny County Superior Court Judge  
Joan Orie-Melvin, sought $50,000 in damages from an AOL user, whose 
identity she did not know, over a statement on a Web site 
expressing dismay that Ms. Orie-Melvin had allegedly lobbied on 
behalf of a lawyer seeking a judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
	She filed the suit in Loudoun County because AOL is based there.  
AOL was not a party to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Loudoun County Circuit Judge Thomas Horne ruled that just  
because AOL is based here does not mean Virginia courts are open to 
lawsuits involving worldwide Internet communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a small case in many ways but the principle is very  
important,'' said Kent Willis, executive director of the ACLU's 
Virginia chapter. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Ms. Orie-Melvin nor her lawyer, Bob Beagan, immediately  
returned telephone messages left today seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Suspense Grips NBA Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the first pick in the NBA draft, some  
team will select somebody. 
</P>
<P>
	Will it be Chicago picking Lamar Odom? Miami picking Odom?  
</P>
<P>
	And what about that second pick? Will Vancouver select Elton  
Brand? Will the Grizzlies trade it so that someone else can get 
Steve Francis? 
</P>
<P>
	Those were only a few of the endless number of questions being  
tossed around in the hours approaching tonight's draft at the MCI 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nerve-racking,'' Francis said. ``It's the last day, and  
you hear so many rumors and so much that's going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the intrigue surrounding the top choice was swirling  
around Chicago Bulls general manager Jerry Krause, who owns the No. 
1 selection and has been actively shopping it around the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver also has been shopping the No. 2 pick.  
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry hasn't made it tough on us. He has a reputation of being  
somewhat secretive,'' Vancouver assistant general manager Noah 
Croom said. ``I don't think we have played our hand any more than 
he has. We will do what we have to do regardless of whether Jerry 
Krause or anyone else has the first pick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just when it seemed the field was narrowed to Francis or Brand  
as the top overall pick, Odom said Tuesday it was his gut feeling 
he'd be picked No. 1 by Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Wally Szczerbiak of Miami of Ohio and UCLA guard Baron Davis are  
expected to round out the top five. 
</P>
<P>
	Around the league, the talk was that the Miami Heat were trying  
to move up to get Odom, while the Lakers and Rockets were 
discussing a trade that would send Scottie Pippen to Los Angeles 
for Glen Rice and Robert Horry. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta and Golden State made a deal, the Hawks sending Mookie  
Blaylock and the No. 21 pick to the Warriors for Bimbo Coles, Duane 
Ferrell and the 10th overall pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The order of selection at the top of the draft -- the first five  
being Chicago, Vancouver, Charlotte, the Los Angeles Clippers and 
Toronto -- figured to change in some way by time the draft begins. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a mystery to me, just like every other player is really  
wondering where they're going,'' Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Krause has been talking to numerous teams to explore dozens of  
trade options, and many people around the league expected him to 
deal the No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a very good possibility that we will not make any  
decision on the draft choice until Wednesday afternoon,'' said 
Krause, who is trying to rebuild the Bulls following the breakup of 
the team that won three straight titles from 1996-98. ``We don't 
feel there's an advantage to us to making it sooner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said coach Tim Floyd: ``If somebody knocks Jerry out with a  
trade, then I'm sure we'll have to look at it and go that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Statements like those were the reason why all the top players  
had a greater air of uncertainty about them than usual on the day 
before the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the comments were downright bold: Brand sounding eager  
to play for Vancouver; Szczerbiak saying he would love to play for 
the Clippers; Odom saying he spoke to Krause several times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chicago's in more of a rebuilding stage,'' said Brand, the  
college player of the year, ``They don't have superstar-level 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vancouver has Mike Bibby at the point, Felipe Lopez had a  
stellar year, I think surprised some people. Then you've got 
Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Big Country (Bryant Reeves) down low. I 
think I could fit in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, who left Duke after his sophomore season, is a 6-foot-8  
forward who played center in college and averaged 17.7 points and 
9.8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis, a 6-3 guard, averaged 17.0 points for Maryland and  
skipped his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a 6-2 point guard from UCLA, figures to be chosen no  
lower than fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak, a 6-7 forward, should be chosen no lower than fifth.  
</P>
<P>
	Aside from Krause's maneuverings, another big draft uncertainty  
was Odom. 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-10 phenom from Rhode Island who could play three positions  
in the pros, Odom might have hurt his stock by declaring for the 
draft, then trying to pull out. He then missed several workouts 
scheduled by NBA teams. 
</P>
<P>
	He was not on time for Tuesday's media availability session held  
by the NBA. On Monday, he worked out in Providence for the Bulls, 
Raptors, Clippers and Timberwolves. Odom also held an earlier 
workout in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	``For teams out there, there's nothing to be scared of,'' Odom  
said. ``I'm not a cancer. I'm a great kid, a little 
misunderstood..'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the top 10 draft slots are Minnesota, Washington,  
Cleveland, Phoenix and Atlanta, who will likely be choosing among 
Jonathan Bender of Picayune High School in Mississippi, guards 
Jason Terry of Arizona, Richard Hamilton of Connecticut, Andre 
Miller of Utah and William Avery of Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Lottery teams Cleveland, Toronto and Seattle will choose 11th,  
12th and 13th. After its trade with Golden State, Atlanta still has 
three picks (Nos. 10, 20 and 27), as does Utah (19, 24 and 28). 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen a draft where more people in the late first  
round were willing to deal their first-round picks,'' Wizards 
general manager Wes Unseld said. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the Rockets, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, confirmed to The Associated Press that the Lakers 
approached Houston on Tuesday with the offer of Rice and Horry, a 
trade that would reunite Pippen with coach Phil Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen struggled in his first season with the Rockets and their  
stagnant offense, while Rice never really fit in with the Lakers 
after they acquired him at midseason for Eddie Jones and Elden 
Campbell. The trade would seem to be a fit for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to Houston whether to do it or not,'' the source said.  
</P>
<P>
	Chicago (Nos. 1 and 16), Toronto (5 and 12), Cleveland (8 and  
11) and Minnesota (6 and 14) have two picks apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas, New Jersey, Sacramento, Milwaukee, Philadelphia,  
Detroit, Orlando and Portland do not have first-round picks.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Select Duke's Brand No. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Chicago Bulls decided to keep their No. 1  
draft pick Wednesday night and selected Elton Brand, the college 
player of the year who left Duke after his sophomore season. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, a 6-foot-8 forward, was chosen after the Bulls took a  
serious last look at Rhode Island's Lamar Odom, bringing him into 
Chicago for a workout on the eve of the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, though, Bulls general manager Jerry Krause went with  
the safer of the two picks, choosing to try to rebuild his dynasty 
with a solid frontcourt player. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, 20, was the first player ever to leave Duke as an  
underclassman. He averaged 16.2 points and 9.8 rebounds in his 
final season at Duke, leading the Blue Devils into the NCAA 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand became the first player from Duke ever selected first  
overall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vancouver Grizzlies selected second and chose guard Steve  
Francis, who had indicated he would be less than enthralled to play 
in Canada. Francis kept his head buried in his hands as his name 
was announced, then raised his arms in the air to a loud ovation as 
he walked onstage to meet commissioner David Stern. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis played in college at nearby Maryland, averaging 17.0  
points in his only season for the Terrapins. Francis, 21, was a 
first-team All-ACC selection last season and was widely considered 
one of the most exciting college players to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	A shooting guard in college who was expected to be a point guard  
in the pros, Francis might play alongside point guard Mike Bibby 
with the Grizzlies. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA guard Baron Davis was taken third by the Charlotte Hornets,  
who had said they would grab him if he was still available. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, 20, left the Bruins after a sophomore season in which he  
averaged 15.9 points and 5.1 assists while still recovering from a 
torn anterior cruciate ligament suffered during the 1998 NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said prior to the draft that he would prefer to play for  
the Los Angeles Clippers, who selected fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	The drafting of Davis is expected to speed up the Hornets'  
efforts to trade veteran point guard David Wesley. Charlotte also 
has been trying to deal one of its power forwards, Derrick Coleman 
or Anthony Mason. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of getting Davis, the Clippers landed Odom, the  
6-foot-10 phenom who so intrigued Krause. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old Odom had one of the most bizarre pre-draft  
existences of anyone, making himself eligible, hiring and then 
firing an agent, trying to get reinstated at Rhode Island and then 
missing a pre-draft physical before NBA scouts in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Those were just the latest travails involving Odom, who attended  
three high schools during his senior season and planned to enroll 
at UNLV before the validity of his entrance exam scores were 
brought into question. 
</P>
<P>
	At Rhode Island, he averaged 17.6 points, 9.4 rebounds and 3.7  
assists -- numbers that had many player personnel directors calling 
him the most talented all-around player available. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto, selecting fifth, took high school center Jonathan  
Bender of Picayune, Miss., a rail-thin, 205-pounder who scored 31 
points in the McDonald's All-American game, breaking Michael 
Jordan's record by one. 
</P>
<P>
	Bender, 6-foot-10, was chosen higher than any high school  
entrant since Kevin Garnett, who went fifth overall to Minnesota in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Wally Szczerbiak went sixth to the Minnesota Timberwolves,  
becoming the first senior selected in this draft. In 1997 and 1998, 
seniors were the top picks overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak, 22, a 6-7 small forward with NBA 3-point range and a  
strong all-around game, is one of three collegians who have been 
added to the U.S. national team that will compete in July for a 
qualifying berth in the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The others are Brand and Richard Hamilton, a shooting guard from  
Connecticut who was chosen seventh by the Washington Wizards -- much 
to the delight of the hometown crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, 21, left Connecticut after a junior season in which he  
averaged 21.5 points and led the Huskies to the national title. He 
could move right into the starting lineup if the Wizards lose Mitch 
Richmond to free agency. Richmond is said to be pondering a return 
to his original NBA team, the Golden State Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Cavaliers, who coveted Szczerbiak, had to settle  
for Utah point guard Andre Miller, a first-team All-American. The 
23-year-old, who also completed four years of college, averaged 
15.8 points and 5.6 assists for Utah last season. 
</P>
<P>
	He is Utah's career leader in steals and led the Utes to the  
NCAA championship game in a junior season during which he shot 55 
percent from the field -- a very high percentage for a point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Marion, a 6-7 forward from UNLV, went ninth overall to the  
Phoenix Suns, who acquired the pick from Dallas a year ago in the 
Steve Nash trade. Marion, who averaged 23.5 points for the Runnin' 
Rebels, left college after his junior year.

<HEADLINE> Senate Agrees to 4-Day HMO Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate has decided to take up ``patients'  
rights'' legislation that would set new controls on HMOs and other 
managed health care plans when Congress returns from the July 4th 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is popular with Americans, most of them in health  
maintenance organizations and other managed care plans. Polls show 
that even people who have not have bad experiences with HMOs fear 
that the care they may need someday will be denied by an insurance 
company trying to save money. 
</P>
<P>
	The tone was congenial on the Senate floor as Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., announced the agreement, belying the 
occasionally nasty fight over how to proceed with the legislation 
that brought Senate business to a halt for a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many senators on both sides who would prefer to do  
this another way,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement reached Tuesday, a four-day HMO debate will  
begin July 12, after the Senate returns from its recess. There are 
limits on how much time may be used debating each amendment, 
guaranteeing votes on a number of Democratic proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides, meanwhile, agreed to resume work this week on a  
series of spending bills, including a farm measure delayed last 
week. The Senate also plans to take up some nominations this week, 
including that of Lawrence Summers to be Treasury secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and Republicans each have legislation they call a  
``patients' bill of rights,'' but the measures differ considerably 
in scope and detail. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans repeatedly offered Democrats the chance to vote yes  
or no on each package as a whole, but Democrats insisted on 
separate votes on several specific points. 
</P>
<P>
	Many provisions of the GOP bill would benefit only the some 48  
million Americans who are in federally regulated, self-insured 
health plans -- generally those offered by large companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats would give patients the right to sue their HMO if they  
are harmed by its decisions on treatment. Democrats also want to 
explicitly give doctors, rather than insurance companies, the right 
to decide what care is medically necessary.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Lower; Dow Down 25.01 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved lower today as traders awaited the  
Federal Reserve's official word on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 25.01 at 10,790.34. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also slightly lower. The Standard  
&AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 7.78 at 1,343.67, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was down 8.90 at 2,633.21. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's Open Market Committee was widely expected to announce  
an increase of a quarter-percentage point in short-term interest 
rates this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were eagerly awaiting the announcement, hoping for an  
end to the volatile price swings and sluggish trading that has 
characterized the market since the Fed first signaled in May its 
willingness to raise rates in an effort to hold off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	As the second quarter and first half drew to a close today, some  
money managers took profits, settling their portfolios after a 
two-day rally that lifted major market indexes earlier this week. 
David G. Sowerby, a vice president at Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co., 
shrugged off the pressure of the Fed's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most anticipated rate hike in the history of the  
Fed,'' he said. ``At this point, the market would only really sour 
if they didn't raise rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of long-distance phone companies were mostly lower after  
one Wall Street analyst predicted a price war. MCI WorldCom fell 6 1/4 
to 87 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney slipped 7/8 to 29 1/4 after reports that Merrill Lynch analyst  
Jessica Reif Cohen forecast lower earnings for fiscal years 1999 
and 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 333.29 million 
shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace but still fairly quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 2.15 at 635.84, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.47 at 778.95. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index, which measures the performance of  
smaller companies, rose 0.96 to 455.04.

<HEADLINE> Retirees Told To Stay Diversified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- It's tempting. It's mighty tempting.  
</P>
<P>
	With yields down for fixed-income investments such as Treasury  
bonds, many retirees needing income from their portfolio may be 
tempted to concentrate more of their money in the big winner of the 
last four years, large-cap stocks represented by the S&AMP;P 500 and 
the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a temptation retirees should try to resist, recommends an  
investment expert at the College for Financial Planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The name of the game for older investors is to make sure their  
wealth is intact, not that their returns are enormous,'' says Ron 
Meier, a senior academic associate at the college. ``Studies are 
clear that one of the best ways to do this is to maintain a 
diversified portfolio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meier says he understands the temptation to load up on the  
large-cap winners. Not only is cash flow down from many 
fixed-income investments, dividends paid by stocks are at record 
lows. 
</P>
<P>
	That means retirees may have to rely on capital-gains income  
from the sale of assets to help replace lost dividend and interest 
payments. ``That's OK, except when it's taken to an extreme,'' 
Meier says. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the problem, says Meier, is that when investors compare  
the superior performance of large-cap stocks over bonds, ``the 
tendency is to sell off those that have not been doing well and 
load up on those that have been doing well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The danger of this, especially for older investors who generally  
can't afford as much risk as younger investors, is that the 
portfolio becomes overloaded with large-cap stocks. ``Large caps 
might do well for a while yet,'' says Meier, ``but at some point 
they will have their day in the snow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meier points to Japan as a classic example. During the 1980s,  
investors couldn't say enough good things about Japanese companies 
(most of which were large cap, by the way) nor enough bad things 
about U.S. companies. Yet Japanese stocks have been all but 
untouchable throughout the 1990s because of their poor performance, 
and U.S. stocks have become widely bought. 
</P>
<P>
	Staying diversified and not overloading on a hot sector of the  
market is especially important for retirees, Meier says. A retiree 
who periodically sells a portion of a portfolio for income will 
find it more difficult to do if the value of the portfolio has 
declined 30 percent because the investor has overloaded on a 
portion of the market that's now down. 
</P>
<P>
	A younger investor, on the other hand, has more time to rebound  
from a down market and usually has wages to provide current cash 
flow needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Meier also cautions that selling off weaker performing bonds in  
favor of higher performing large-cap stocks runs counter to one of 
the golden rules of investing: Sell off a portion of your winners 
and buy losers, or put another way, sell high, buy low. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving up some winners for losers can be a psychologically  
difficult move to make, but it does provide investing benefits. For 
one thing, Meier emphasizes, a market downturn will have less of an 
impact on undervalued assets, such as small-cap stocks which are 
selling at historical lows compared with large-cap stocks. ``If you 
want to preserve wealth, you don't want to concentrate on areas 
that are doing well, but in those places that are down,'' Meier 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Second, undervalued assets are tomorrow's investment  
opportunities. Meier notes that emerging foreign markets, which 
many investors fled during 1997 and 1998 because of their dismal 
performance, are up 30 percent so far in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	When an undervalued asset rebounds, it's common for a large  
portion of the gains to occur in the early stages of the rebound, 
Meier notes. Since it's difficult to know when a rebound might 
occur, staying diversified is a good way to be in place to capture 
the rebound. Also, studies have shown that diversifying can boost 
returns, not dilute them. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, Meier says, bonds should continue to play an important  
role in a retiree's portfolio. Many experts suggest an exposure of 
at least 30 percent of your portfolio's total value. 
</P>
<P>
	While total returns (interest payments plus any capital gains)  
for Treasury bonds probably will be only in the 5 percent to 6 
percent range, the presence of the bonds will reduce overall risk 
for the portfolio. Also, because the inflation rate is so low, the 
after-inflation return of bonds has been above average. 
</P>
<P>
	Meier recommends that retirees calculate what cash needs they  
may require from their portfolio over the next three to five years 
and have at least that much invested in bonds. That way, if the 
stock market declines significantly, retirees can sell their bonds 
for needed cash instead of their down stocks.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Predicted To Open Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cuba will only break with communism and open  
itself fully as a market economy once President Fidel Castro is no 
longer in power, three Cuban-American panelists agreed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen in 40 years that a transition is not possible with  
Castro in power,'' said Otto Reich, a former U.S. ambassador to 
Venezuela who left Cuba at age 14 
</P>
<P>
	Reich, now president of the U.S.-Cuba Business Council, said  
during a panel discussion sponsored by the nonprofit Americas 
Society that Cuba has enormous potential as a market once there is 
a change in the island's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall, many Cuban-Americans  
and U.S. businesses are still waiting for the island to undergo a 
similar transformation to a more democratic, capitalist society. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investment in a free Cuba could dwarf that of former  
Soviet-bloc countries,'' Reich predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba has struggled to stay afloat economically without  
sacrificing socialism since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. 
Economic troubles in the early 1990s forced Cuba's leaders to 
legalize U.S. dollars and allow small, private businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Another speaker, University of California, Santa Cruz, professor  
Manuel Pastor, Jr., said modest reforms in recent years were ``baby 
steps'' that Cuba's top leaders don't want to carry further. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's unlikely Castro, now 73, will allow any transition to  
an open market, said Arturo Villar, publisher of Hispanic Market 
Weekly, a business newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	If the United States were to lift its embargo against Cuba, the  
island's government would collapse within months amid anarchy, 
predicted Villar. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastor said a move to a more liberal system in Cuba is  
inevitable. ``It will head to a more liberal political system. It 
will head to a more liberal economic system. We don't know when, we 
don't know how. But we know it's going there.''

<HEADLINE> OJ Salmonella Outbreak Spurs Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A lawsuit was filed Wednesday in a West Coast  
salmonella outbreak linked to unpasteurized orange juice as health 
officials said the number of cases is likely to exceed 50. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit for unspecified damages from Sun Orchard Co. of Tempe,  
Ariz., was filed in King County Superior Court on behalf of Ian 
Jackson, 4, of Seattle by William D. Marler, a lawyer specializing 
in damage actions stemming from food poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
	Marler also asked that the suit be certified as a class action  
on behalf of all those sickened by drinking the company's fresh 
orange juice. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Kurtz, a Sun Orchard spokesman, said company officials had  
not seen the lawsuit. Company officials have had some contact with 
those who got sick but have not paid any compensation or negotiated 
with anyone on that issue, Kurtz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Alstead, a spokesman for Public Health-Seattle &AMP; King  
County, said four more cases have been linked genetically to the 
salmonella bacteria found in an unopened container of Sun Orchard 
juice, bringing the total to 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 21 cases in the county are undergoing DNA testing, as  
are five salmonella cases in other counties in the state, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least four cases in Oregon and one involving a New York man  
who got sick after drinking orange juice at a hotel in Oakland, 
Calif., also are under review. 
</P>
<P>
	Alstead said the total linked to Sun Orchard juice probably will  
exceed 50 once the tally is complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurtz has said the juice was blended from oranges squeezed in  
Tempe and product from an outside supplier that he would not 
identify. 
</P>
<P>
	All outside juice is thoroughly tested for disease-causing  
organisms at an FDA-certified laboratory in Phoenix before entering 
the plant, Kurtz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims Sun Orchard failed to ensure that its juice  
was ``from safe, and reliable sources ... clean, wholesome and free 
from spoilage and adulteration and ... safe for human 
consumption.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also accused the company of failing to supervise  
suppliers or provide them with sufficient standards ``and as a 
result purchased and used ingredients that were contaminated with 
salmonella.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The boy cited in the lawsuit contracted a high fever, severe  
cramps and bloody diarrhea that persisted for nearly a week after a 
Father's Day dinner at a restaurant with his parents, Jim and Fiona 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Marler, who handled most of the suits stemming from E. coli  
contamination of unpasteurized apple juice sold by Odwalla Inc. in 
1996, is seeking damages for illness, pain and suffering, future 
medical monitoring, mental distress, lost wages and damage to the 
parent-child relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Odwalla agreed to pay a record $1.5 million criminal  
penalty. It reportedly has paid as much as $15 million to settle 
lawsuits.

<HEADLINE> Rain Replaces Fire for Pepsi 400 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Burned-out trees still line the  
interstate heading south into Daytona Beach, a sullen reminder of 
the forest fires that washed out last year's Pepsi 400 on 
Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, most of those trees are standing in huge puddles of  
water, courtesy of heavy rains over the past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Thankfully, rain has overtaken fire as the prime concern heading  
into Saturday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	The forecast calls for a 50 percent chance of afternoon and  
evening thunderstorms Thursday, when pole qualifying takes place 
under the lights. The rain chance decreases to 30 percent for the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Daytona International Speedway was nearly silent under heavy,  
gray skies Wednesday as teams continued their cross-country trek 
from Sears Point to begin the second half of the NASCAR schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, fires raged across the state, forcing hundreds of  
families from their homes and causing millions of dollars in 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	As about 130,000 fans made their way to the speedway, track  
officials prepared for racing as usual. But by midweek, the fires 
had moved within mere miles of the track -- burning embers actually 
flew onto the raceway -- and the race was postponed while track 
personnel chipped in on the firefighting. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened was not in our control,'' track vice president  
Andrew Gurtis said. ``We'll always remember that. I don't think we 
live in fear of it. But having gone through it, we don't want to 
have to go through it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the race was run in October, Jeff Gordon edged Bobby  
Labonte for his second Pepsi 400 title. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Gordon won the Daytona 500, giving him a chance for  
a third straight victory at Daytona and a rare sweep of the races 
at NASCAR's most famous track. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Fireball Roberts (1962), Cale Yarborough (1968), LeeRoy  
Yarborough (1969) and Bobby Allison (1982) have accomplished the 
Daytona Double. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning a second consecutive Pepsi 400 coming off a win in the  
Daytona 500 -- there's not much that could beat that,'' said Gordon, 
the two-time defending Winston Cup champion. ``That would 
definitely be a highlight in my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daytona is still basking in its decision to fully light its  
track, capitalizing on NASCAR's popularity and transforming the 
Independence Day race from a 95-degree, mid-afternoon scorcher into 
something more palatable for fans and drivers alike. 
</P>
<P>
	The lights cost between $2 million and $3 million -- the track  
won't say exactly how much -- and made the raceway home of the 
biggest lighting project in the history of sports. Lighting the 
speedway uses the same amount of power needed to light 24,285 
blocks of residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason it works is that this place is spectacular under  
the lights,'' Gurtis said. ``Those cars, the overall experience of 
a nighttime sporting event, is pretty powerful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although stock car racing is rooted in Friday and Saturday night  
racing under the lights at small tracks, this is lighting on the 
grandest scale. 
</P>
<P>
	``A night race under the lights on the Fourth of July weekend,  
you just can't get much better than that,'' driver Jerry Nadeau 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The change in scenery does, however, give reason for concern.  
</P>
<P>
	``At night, there's shadows and reflections you don't get during  
the day,'' said 1997 champion John Andretti, the last driver to win 
the Pepsi 400 during the daytime. ``The race track is different, 
but it's still slippery. During the day, the sun is out and the 
heat bakes it and oils seep through. At night, the humidity is so 
thick it's slick. I thought it would be easier, but it's still a 
little slick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barring a storm, the Pepsi 400 will be televised on CBS, marking  
the first prime-time network telecast of a NASCAR race. The 1998 
race was scheduled for the network, but CBS passed after fires 
forced the race to be rescheduled for Oct. 17, the middle of 
football season.

<HEADLINE> More Interest Rate Hikes Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In raising interest rates a quarter-point, the  
Federal Reserve signaled its latest action could be enough to keep 
inflation under control. But some economists are still betting on 
additional rate hikes later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed watchers had expected the decision to increase the target  
for the funds rate -- the interest that banks charge each other on 
overnight loans -- from 4.75 percent to 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, commercial banks said they would increase their  
prime lending rate -- the benchmark for millions of business and 
consumer loans, from 7.75 percent to 8 percent. Bank of America led 
the way, announcing an increase in its prime rate to 8 percent 
effective today. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts were caught by surprise by the statement from Alan  
Greenspan, the federal reserve chairman, and his colleagues that 
they had moved their policy directive, which signals the future 
course of interest rates, back to neutral. Financial markets were 
cheered by the development with both stocks and bonds posting huge 
rallies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed had changed its directive at the last meeting on May 18  
from neutral to one leaning toward raising rates, putting markets 
on notice that rates could soon go up. In June 17 testimony to 
Congress, Greenspan had said, ``When we can be pre-emptive, we 
should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the market's jubilant reaction Wednesday, the Fed's move  
to a neutral policy bias didn't quell speculation among some 
economists that the Fed could raise short-term rates again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think we will get a couple more this year,'' said  
economist Sung Won Sohn of Wells Fargo. ``I think they left 
themselves plenty of room to raise interest rates if they wanted to 
in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sohn and other economists cited, as evidence, a line in the  
Fed's statement Wednesday saying, ``It must be especially alert to 
the emergence or potential emergence, of inflationary forces that 
could undermine economic growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim O'Neill, chief economist for Harris Bank and the Bank of  
Montreal, still believes the Fed will raise rates another quarter 
point at its meeting in August, although he said the new neutral 
bias lowers the odds of such action at that meeting. He expects 
more rate hikes after that. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the first and only. This is the first of  
several,'' O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed will have a wealth of new economic data -- including a  
report on unemployment, coming out Friday, and second-quarter 
figures on the nation's economic growth, coming out in late July -- 
to analyze before its next meeting on Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line: another tightening is certainly possible, but  
is no sure thing,'' said Merrill Lynch economist Bruce Steinberg. 
``Unless job growth is overly robust during the next two months, 
the Fed can remain on hold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though some analysts are still betting on additional rate  
hikes, overall they were heartened by what they described as the 
moderate tone of the Fed's statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message from the Fed is that they are not in any big hurry  
nor particularly worried that quick action is necessary on the 
inflation front,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Primark 
Global Economics in New York. ``The markets are relieved because 
the central bank could have been a lot tougher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts said they read in the central bank's statement a  
willingness to continue testing the view of many economists that 
the U.S. economy has entered a new era where higher productivity 
allows stronger growth and lower unemployment rates without 
triggering inflation worries. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. economy has been growing at close to a 4 percent rate  
for the past two years, far above the Fed's traditional speed limit 
of around 2.5 percent for economic growth. The faster growth has 
pushed unemployment down to a three-decade low of 4.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	When the economy is growing at a rate the Fed believes is too  
fast, it raises interest rates to slow spending on big-ticket items 
such as homes, autos and appliances. In that way, economic growth 
slows and inflation pressures remain in check. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Fed critics said they were unhappy that the Fed felt the  
need to raise interest rates at all, given that consumer-level 
inflation is low. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately the Federal Reserve has allowed their inordinate  
fear of inflation to put America's strong economy in jeopardy,'' 
said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. ``While some claim this quarter-point 
increase may be largely symbolic, it means high costs to businesses 
and consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed rate hike marked the first increase in the funds rate  
since March 1997. Last fall, the Fed cut the funds rate in three 
quarter-point moves out of concern that overseas turmoil from the 
Asian currency crisis at the time was threatening the U.S. economy.

<HEADLINE> Claudia Church Seeks Nashville Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- It's one thing to be a hairdresser and  
give up that career in pursuit of country music stardom. It's quite 
another to move to Nashville seeking country music fame after 
success as an international model and actress. 
</P>
<P>
	Tammy Wynette did the former and became a superstar.  
</P>
<P>
	Claudia Church, 37, is trying to do it the other way around.  
</P>
<P>
	This is actually her second go-around in Music City. The first  
time, the blond beauty left town to accept modeling jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	She walked the runways in Paris and Japan, and also landed small  
roles on a number of television shows, including the hit series 
``Dallas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It started to go really well for me, and scared me a little  
because I didn't want to be known for modeling. They'd laugh at me 
if I tried to be a country singer after being known for modeling,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	So, at the height of her success, she gave it all up, returning  
to Nashville in 1988 and struggling for a decade to make her mark 
as a singer. 
</P>
<P>
	She has done it with ``Small Town Girl,'' one of the brightest  
debut albums of the year. The first single, ``What's the Matter 
With You Baby,'' turned heads with a video and sound that seemed to 
come out of some lost sequel to ``Grease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Think Ronnie Spector with a touch of Wynette twang and you'll  
have a pretty good idea where Church is coming from. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's the matter with you baby/Do you only want the ones that  
you know you can't have/True love's so much better than that,'' she 
sings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the old '60s songs, the 'roll down your window and sing  
at the top of your lungs' kind of thing,'' Church said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodney Crowell, an acclaimed songwriter, said his wife ``kind of  
woke me up'' with the album. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tend to be one of those artists that labors in angst,'' said  
Crowell, whose hits include ``Shame on the Moon'' and ``'Till I 
Gain Control Again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What she had envisioned was a real `girl' quality. For lack of  
a better way to describe it, a real conscious innocence. Not the 
kind of innocence where you're a fool, but the kind of musical joy 
that comes from making music as a girl would make it, if she's 
unencumbered by crap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crowell, initially reluctant to get involved with his wife's  
singing career, ended up producing ``Small Town Girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born into a military family and raised mostly in Lenoir, N.C.,  
Church dreamed of country music stardom as a little girl. She sings 
about it on the standout song ``Home in My Heart,'' which she wrote 
with Crowell. 
</P>
<P>
	``Skinny legs and barefoot on the top of an abandoned  
car/Pouring out my heart just like a country-music singing 
star/Pine cone for a microphone/Full moon for a spotlight/Shining 
down from heaven, like it's smiling on me,'' she sings. 
</P>
<P>
	Church first came to Nashville in her early 20s. She made the  
rounds in a ``teal taffeta little number'' that she sewed herself 
and made some minor headway. But success as a model came more 
quickly. She abandoned Nashville when she got an offer to model in 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never really dated in high school, and I started thinking,  
`How could I sing a sad song if I've never had my heart broken?''' 
Church said. ``I thought I should just live a little first, go to 
Paris, model awhile, grow up a bit and then come to Nashville.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She modeled full time for five years. Afraid of losing sight of  
her original goal, she moved back to Nashville in 1988. To pay the 
bills, she did some modeling and appeared in about 20 music videos, 
including those of Ricky Van Shelton and Steve Wariner. 
</P>
<P>
	On the set for the video to ``Lovin' All Night'' in 1992, she  
met her future husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was the lead video goddess,'' Crowell said. ``We took up,  
became friends, and one thing led to another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The couple agreed to keep their personal and professional lives  
separate, so Church played down her connection to Crowell and used 
modeling money to finance recording sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowell ended up reneging on the deal. While Church was out of  
town, he took some tapes to Warner Bros. head Jim Ed Norman and got 
her a record deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first, I wasn't interested in working with a woman who I  
had a relationship with because I had done that before,'' said 
Crowell, who produced records for his first wife, Rosanne Cash. 
``And then I started to soften to the idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crowell supplied several songs for the album, including ``I  
Don't Fall in Love So Easy,'' written about him falling in love 
with Church. He also shaped an updated girl-group sound for her, 
including a chilling version of ``Will You Love Me Tomorrow,'' a 
1961 pop hit for the Shirelles. 
</P>
<P>
	The sound was inspired by the re-release of ``Grease'' last  
year. Crowell took his 8-year-old daughter Cary to see the film. 
</P>
<P>
	``She loved it,'' Crowell said. ``I kind of watched it through  
her eyes and really got taken by the innocence of the music. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came back from the movie. ... And I got the soundtrack and  
started blasting it. And Claudia would kind of look over my 
shoulder and say, `What are you doing?' 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her I thought it would apply to what we were doing. And  
she said, 'I see what you're getting at.'''

<HEADLINE>  U.N., Key Players Discuss Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Less than three weeks after the Kosovo  
conflict ended, Secretary-General Kofi Annan convened key 
international players today to urge a more rapid deployment of 
troops and U.N. personnel to run the battered province. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we must do today is make sure having won the war, we are  
now in a position to build the peace, working with the local 
population and working with the international community,'' British 
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told reporters as he arrived for the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan said he would urge the 16 nations and three international  
organizations attending the meeting to help get the U.N. civilian 
administration up and running more quickly. He said it also was 
important to bring ministers together ``to discuss what our needs 
are, to try and accelerate the deployment, particularly of the 
troops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 24,000 troops of the expected 50,000-strong NATO-led  
force are now on the ground in Kosovo, said Cook, quoting British 
Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson, the force commander. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook said he would report to the meeting that the deployment  
``has been carried out with remarkable professionalism and 
competence'' -- but there are ``very serious problems,'' many 
related to the absence of a U.N. civilian police force and a 
functioning legal system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our task today is to make sure that the civil side of the  
operation catches up with the military track, which is already in 
place within Kosovo,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine echoed the need for  
speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a lot of reasons, we have to go even faster, and we are  
here for that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations needs money to pay local officials, including  
judges and utility workers, and to finance urgent projects like 
putting a roof on a school. It has pledges for about 1,300 civilian 
police, including a new U.S. commitment to send 450. But the United 
Nations wants a force of 3,000, a senior U.N. official said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on her arrival that  
the meeting of the participants in the Kosovo mission to make 
future plans was ``unprecedented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Group of Eight -- the seven major industrialized nations and  
Russia who formulated terms for the settlement of the Kosovo 
conflict between NATO and Yugoslavia -- originally proposed today's 
meeting to assess progress on implementing the terms of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Annan decided to expand the session to his so-called Friends  
of Kosovo, adding eight more countries and three organizations who 
are playing a major role in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this whole effort is to try to bring it all  
together,'' Albright said after meeting Annan Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary-general said he wanted ``... to appeal for  
everyone to work with us in not only putting in the men and women 
we need, but also to make the resources available, and to keep each 
other informed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten foreign ministers are representing their governments,  
including Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the United States is committed to supporting the U.N.  
operation in Kosovo both financially and in terms of personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very supportive of what has to happen,'' Albright said  
after meeting Annan at his residence. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan briefed the meeting on the status of U.N. efforts in  
Kosovo, 17 days after the arrival there of his acting special 
representative, U.N. humanitarian chief Sergio Vieira de Mello. So 
far, 428 international staff are in the province, along with dozens 
of U.N. refugee workers. 
</P>
<P>
	At the meeting, Norway's Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek is  
representing the 54-nation Organization of Security and Cooperation 
in Europe, which has been given responsibility for building 
democratic institutions and organizing elections in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union, which the United Nations has put in charge  
of reconstruction in Kosovo, and Organization of the Islamic 
Conference, whose members have been contributed large amounts of 
humanitarian aid to ethnic Albanian refugees, will also be 
attending. 
</P>
<P>
	All the G-8 countries except Russia, Canada and Japan are  
sending their foreign ministers -- the United States, Britain, 
France, Germany, Italy. The foreign ministers of the Netherlands, 
Spain, Turkey, Finland and Greece are also attending along with 
senior officials from Belgium, Denmark and China.

	Irish Peace Talks Adjourn  
</P>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Northern Ireland's rival  
politicians adjourned talks early Thursday morning after failing to 
agree on how to form a Protestant-Catholic government. The 
politicians, however, said they would return after a few hours of 
sleep to continue efforts to salvage last year's landmark Good 
Friday peace accord. President Clinton, meanwhile, urged the 
British and Irish to ``give peace a chance,'' telling reporters 
after a speech in Chicago that he stands ready to become personally 
involved in the deadlocked talks in Belfast -- if he is needed.

	BEIJING (AP) -- Even though he is resigning with U.S.-China

that Chinese leaders have indicated to him that they want to repair 
ties hurt by NATO's accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 
Yugoslavia. In an interview Wednesday with Associated Press

	CHICAGO (AP) -- President Clinton pitched his Medicare plan  
Wednesday, teasing the GOP: ``No one escapes time and age. 
Republicans age just like Democrats.'' The president addressed some 
350 senior citizens at the Chicago Cultural Center. But his message 
also was aimed at Republicans laboring on Capitol Hill to find 
fault with his ideas. His proposal includes new, universal coverage 
for prescription drugs and the elimination of patient copayments 
for preventive services, in addition to incentives for Medicare 
patients to choose more cost-effective HMO's.

investigation Wednesday with guilty pleas from presidential friend 
Webster Hubbell and declared he's seeking an ``orderly conclusion'' 
to the rest of his work. Hubbell, the former No. 3 Justice

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time in two years, the Federal

quarter-point hike may be enough to keep inflation under control. 
The Dow industrial average soared 155.45 points to 10,970.80. The 
bond market, which has been battered for weeks by fears of 
inflation and higher interest rates, also staged a strong rally.

	SEATTLE (AP) -- Starbucks Corp. warned Wednesday that annual

portal. Analysts had estimated the gourmet coffee retailer would 
earn 60 cents per share for fiscal 1999. But Starbucks late

<HEADLINE> Two Special Olympians Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Two Moroccan soccer players are missing  
from their nation's delegation to the Special Olympics World Summer 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The disappearances come after two Special Olympics basketball  
players from the Dominican Republic left their delegation last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The four missing athletes have broken no law, according to  
authorities. Organizers contacted police to find the men and make 
sure they are safe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Morrocan players -- Niam Tanji, 21, and Jamal Agdani, 23 --  
were last seen at lunch Monday and did not attend their soccer game 
later in the day, event officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Moroccan coach told the head of the delegation, who then  
alerted organizers, said Joe Freddoso, chief executive officer of 
the games. Authorities said there was no indication of foul play. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tiger Woods Used to Large Gallery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- The gallery engulfed and then nearly  
swallowed him two years ago as he walked up the 18th fairway, ready 
to finish off a victory in the Western Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods, by now, is used to those swarms that follow his  
every move. 
</P>
<P>
	They come to watch him be brilliant. They want to see him  
dominate a game that frustrates millions or rout a confounding 
course with his shot selection. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overwhelming, no. Distracting sometimes. Obviously they're  
making a lot of noise and it depends when they make that noise -- if 
it's in your swing or they catch you in a wrong moment, then it's a 
little tough,'' Woods said Wednesday on the eve of the $2.5 million 
Western Open, which is sponsored by Motorola. 
</P>
<P>
	``They get excited when we pull off shots, and especially shots  
they can't hit. That's what makes it neat when you can go out and 
pull off a few good shots. And who knows? You can get on a little 
hot streak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's on one.  
</P>
<P>
	Woods, with three straight top 10 finishes, and Vijay Singh,  
who's placed in the top five of his last three, lead the Western 
field. U.S. Open champion Payne Stewart and money leader David 
Duval are among those absent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cog Hill Golf and Country Club is where Woods had his first  
sub-70 round in a professional tournament, shooting 69 on the final 
day of the 1995 tournament when he was still an amateur. Two years 
later, he won the tournament, his fourth title during a torrid 1997 
that included a Masters title. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's made some changes in his game, especially with his  
swing, and has two tour victories this season. He reeled off the 
technical alterations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've worked on changing my grip a little bit, worked on my  
first move off the ball,'' he said. ``My swing plane, make sure I 
rounded off in the top instead of early and don't get too deep too 
early. From there, just keep the club head in front of me on the 
way down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods said it's taken some time to adjust.  
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt I have an even more well-rounded game now,'' he said.  
``If you look at the way I played in '97, I did win, yes. But where 
did I finish when I didn't win? I'm finishing higher now when I 
don't have it, which means my swing is better. My short game is 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singh's putting grip is certainly different. Last year's  
Western, where he finished second, is where he committed to a 
cross-handed approach. Seven weeks later, he won the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd putted cross-handed before but this was the first time  
where I said, 'This is it.' And I haven't changed since. This is 
the longest streak I've had putting cross-handed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he led after three rounds last year, Singh didn't  
win the Western because Joe Durant was too good on the final day, 
shooting a 66 to win by two strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't lose it. He won it,'' Singh said.

<HEADLINE> Designer Makes Over Hospital Gowns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Finally -- someone has beefed up the skimpy  
hospital gown. 
</P>
<P>
	A designer whose clothing is usually draped on runway models has  
put together a chic new line that could permanently shelve the 
gowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey unveiled  
patient wear yesterday that features zippers, drawstrings and 
buttons in place of the traditional rear-end airy slit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we fixed up our food, the gown was the No. 1 complaint,''  
said John P. Ferguson, the hospital's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid cheers and pumping music at The Rainbow Room, the new line  
was previewed on a runway by models who looked anything but ill. 
The duds are the creation of Cynthia Rowley, whose non-hospital 
work has been praised by fashion critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always believed that what one wears on the outside  
affects the way they feel about themselves on the inside,'' Rowley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital will introduce the new line in about six months.  
</P>
<P>
	Women will wear a mid-calf length gown with a mock turtleneck  
and three-quarter length sleeves with snaps. Men will wear 
drawstring pants, a short sleeve shirt and a matching robe. 
</P>
<P>
	For children, there's an ankle-length gown and drawstring pants.  
</P>
<P>
	Currently, white hospital gowns cost the hospital about $6 a  
piece. Ferguson said the price likely won't increase because the 
clothing is made out of the same material as the gowns -- cotton. 
</P>
<P>
	There will also be a selection of colors: red, white, blue,  
black and pink. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Missouri state Rep. Sam Gaskill pushed a bill  
that would have required hospitals in his state to provide patients 
with ``dignity gowns,'' covering the body from neck to knee. The 
bill never made it out of committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaskill introduced the bill after a four-day hospital stay.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Hits the Beach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMPTON, N.H. (AP) -- Democratic presidential hopeful Bill  
Bradley brought a little change of scenery to sunbathers on Hampton 
Beach Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In his fifth trip to New Hampshire since announcing his  
candidacy in January, the former New Jersey senator and 
professional basketball player pounded about a half mile of sand, 
shaking hands, signing autographs and listening to people's 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley chatted with potential voters in bikinis and swim trunks  
and listened to sand-covered children shouting ``Hi, Mr. 
President!'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Flaminio of Worcester, Mass., noticed Bradley was wearing  
socks with the insignia of his old National Basketball Association 
team, the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was wondering if anyone was going to notice,'' said a  
beaming Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Waterman, who teaches seventh grade life science in Bangor,  
Maine, told Bradley that teachers' salaries are too low. 
</P>
<P>
	And Don Gannon, a 25-year teacher in Worcester, Mass., said  
teachers need help getting more respect from the public. ``It seems 
everyone wants to take a potshot at teachers,'' he told Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley told them that the ``most important thing in a child's  
learning career is a teacher.'' He also noted that his mother and 
an aunt were teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley got one challenge during his 90-minute walk.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll vote for you if you go in the water,'' said Ann Millett  
of West Springfield, Mass. Bradley, wearing sneakers, got just 
barely into the water, not far enough to get his sneakers wet. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Millett said she was satisfied.  
</P>
<P>
	``I support him on everything,'' said Helen Murray of Chester,  
who got Bradley to autograph a photograph of him and her 6-year old 
son taken in Derry a few months ago. ``He stands on his own two 
feet; I think he's great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley is Vice President Al Gore's only announced rival for the  
Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he has a tough road to hoe because of all the support  
(for) Gore,'' said Donald Williamson, who came from Andover, Mass., 
to see Bradley. ``But he's the alternative and that can give him an 
advantage. Americans tend to for the underdog. It's genetic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley made weekend ``beach walks'' a habit when he was in the  
Senate. He said he goes to beaches ``out of respect to voters -- 
because the beach is where they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Besides,'' he said, ``wouldn't your rather be out in the  
sun?''

<HEADLINE> Airlines Boost Incentives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- In a play for business travelers weary of high  
fares, major airlines are sharply boosting frequent-flyer 
incentives on flights this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta Airlines started by offering passengers 70 percent more  
frequent-flyer miles. USAirways upped the ante by offering double 
miles, and others soon followed, including American, United, 
Continental, Northwest and TWA. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said adding miles was an inexpensive way to help  
airlines keep up with rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	The double-mileage offers apply only to full-fare tickets in  
first class, business or coach. American and some others require 
passengers to register by phone or through the Internet in order to 
get the miles, which will be awarded for domestic or international 
trips through Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Dreslin, a spokesman for American, said business travelers  
were a target of the promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	But the added mileage probably won't be much of a draw for  
business travelers because airlines have raised the miles needed to 
earn free trips, said Raymond Neidl, an airlines analyst with ING 
Barings Furman Selz in New York 
</P>
<P>
	Most airlines now charge 25,000 miles for a domestic ticket.  
Even doubled, that still means four coast-to-coast round trips to 
earn a free flight. 
</P>
<P>
	More business travelers are shopping around for three-day  
advance fares, Internet deals and other discount tickets, analysts 
said. But the frequent-flyer deals still hold appeal for people who 
dream of free flights to exotic locales. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreslin, the American spokesman, said 9 percent of all the  
airline's passengers last year were flying free with mileage 
awards.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Says Bomber Performed Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The B-2 ``stealth'' bomber performed well over  
Yugoslavia, despite recent congressional reports of weaknesses and 
technical flaws, Air Force officials told a House panel today. 
</P>
<P>
	The $2 billion planes flew through bad weather and hit  
``everything we aimed at,'' said Air Force Brig. Gen. Leroy 
Barnidge, commander of the B-2 bomber force. 
</P>
<P>
	``The B-2 exceeded all our expectations for durability,  
reliability and overall performance,'' he told a House Armed 
Services subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	While some of the B-2s required maintenance after returning from  
a bombing run in NATO's 78-day air war against Serb forces, others 
were able to take off on a new mission after only loading 
replacement bombs and refueling, Barnidge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The testimony comes two weeks after a General Accounting Office  
report questioned the durability of the special materials that make 
the bat-winged B-2 nearly invisible to enemy radar. 
</P>
<P>
	``These problems remain the primary cause for high maintenance  
times and a reduced pace in flight operations,'' said the report by 
the investigative branch of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO said that while the Air Force has taken steps to address  
the problems, the 10-plane fleet suffers long down times for repair 
of its delicate stealth parts. The GAO completed the report, the 
sixth in five years on the B-2, before the 11-week Balkan air war 
ended June 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawmakers questioned the Air Force's decision to back up  
the B-2 with extensive support aircraft and radar-jamming planes -- 
protection against the enemy that the plane's designers claimed 
wouldn't be needed for stealth missions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's prudent to provide as much buffer and coverage''  
as possible, said Lt. Gen. Marvin R. Esmond, deputy chief of staff 
for Air and Space Operations. But under the right circumstances, he 
said, the B-2 could ``go in alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six B-2s flew 30-hour nonstop missions from Whiteman Air Force  
Base in Missouri to Yugoslavia and back. The planes flew only about 
50 of the more than 34,000 sorties by NATO pilots, but its strikes 
accounted for 11 percent of the bombs dropped -- 1.4 million pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	A B-2 mistakenly bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last  
month, but Pentagon officials said the fault lay with bad maps and 
other errors by NATO rather than with the plane or its crew.

<HEADLINE> Hubbell Pleads Guilty in Starr Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Foreign Relations Committee took  
less than a minute today to approve the long-delayed nomination of 
veteran diplomat Richard Holbrooke to be U.S. ambassador to the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke was among 25 diplomatic nominations that were passed  
by the panel at the same time, by voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote sends the nomination to the Senate floor. Holbrooke  
supporters hoped the Senate could vote on the nomination by week's 
end so the long-vacant top U.S. job at the United Nations could be 
filled. 
</P>
<P>
	But the nomination had a final obstacle to overcome: a ``hold''  
put on it by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, over an unrelated civil 
service dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	By Senate tradition, any senator can hold up -- at least for a  
while -- any nomination for any reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley complained about what he contended was punishment of a  
civil service worker, Linda Shenwick, an employee of the U.N. 
mission in New York. She contends she was transferred and demoted 
for telling the Congress and the news media about State Department 
of waste and mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is happening to me should not happen in the United States  
of America,'' Shenwick said on ABC's ``Nightline'' Tuesday night. 
``It certainly should not happen in a government office to a 
government employee who is telling the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of both parties were conferring today with Grassley in  
an effort to resolve the dispute. Senators generally predicted the 
matter would be resolved, but weren't sure how. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything's resolvable around here,'' said Sen. John Kerry,  
D-Mass., a committee member. 
</P>
<P>
	An aide to Grassley, Jill Kozeny, said today that the hold on  
Holbrooke remains in place, although ``this matter can be resolved 
by the end of the week.'' She said Grassley was not necessarily 
insisting that Shenwick be reinstated in her old job but wanted 
``an agreement reached between the parties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The State Department has not contacted Senator Grassley yet,''  
she said. ``The question is how badly does the State Department 
want the nomination.'' She said Grassley support Holbrooke and 
wants to see him confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department denies that Kozeny was punished for  
expressing her views. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton announced his intention to nominate Holbrooke  
in June 1998, but the nomination was held up for nine months while 
the Justice and State Departments investigated ethics allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Foreign Relations panel then conducted its own investigation  
into the allegations, and held three separate confirmation hearings 
on Holbrooke. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, the allegations focused on private-sector  
contacts Holbrooke had and speaking fees he received after leaving 
the State Department for the private sector in 1996. Holbrooke paid 
$5,000 to resolve most of the allegations, but without admitting 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, an investment banker, is a former assistant secretary  
of state and ambassador to Germany. He has also served as Clinton's 
special envoy on the Balkans, and was the architect of the peace 
accord that ended the civil war in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the repeated snags his nomination has hit, Holbrooke  
enjoys wide support in the Senate, including from the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee chairman, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	At today's business meeting, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., moved  
simply that all nominations on the panel's agenda by approved. 
Helms asked if anyone wanted to speak. 
</P>
<P>
	No one did, and the nominations were approved.  
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke was not in the room. He was represented by Barbara  
Larkin, the State Department's liaison officer with Congress. Helms 
asked her if she had anything to say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just thank you very much,'' Larkin said.  
</P>
<P>
	Helms joked that it was probably ``the quickest vote'' the  
committee had ever had. 
</P>
<P>
	Also approved by the panel: The nomination of John Holum as  
undersecretary of state for arms control and international security 
affairs. Holum is the first person to serve in the new post. Holum 
had served since 1993 as director of the Arms Control and 
Disarmament Agency, but that agency went out of business on April 1 
when its functions were merged with the State Department.

<HEADLINE> Rail Inspections Continue in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARLINGEN, Texas (AP) -- Not since the days of the Wild West have  
the railroads been involved in a manhunt on this scale. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers and railroad police are stopping trains and searching  
boxcars for Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, the tattooed ex-convict 
suspected in eight slayings along the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only one I can think of is the manhunt for Jesse James,''  
Union Pacific spokesman Mark Davis said of the search. 
</P>
<P>
	But investigators may have found evidence far from those tracks:  
Texas Rangers are trying to determine if jewelry and other items 
obtained from the wife of Resendez-Ramirez can be linked to the 
murders, the Houston Chronicle reported today on its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Julietta Dominguez Reyes gave the items to U.S. marshals and  
Mexican authorities last weekend when they interviewed her in 
Mexico, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 pieces of jewelry, five pairs of shoes, shorts and  
other items were shipped to authorities in El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are investigating the items to see if they have any  
evidentiary value and to determine if any originated from the homes 
of murder victims,'' said Ranger Sgt. Drew Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez has been charged with two murders in Illinois  
and is suspected of five killings in Texas and a 1997 slaying in 
Kentucky. The victims were all killed in homes near railroad 
tracks. Most were bludgeoned. 
</P>
<P>
	Fingerprints link Resendez-Ramirez to at least some of the  
killings. The FBI says his real name is Angel Leoncio Reyes 
Recendis, based on a birth certificate registered in Puebla, 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Resendez-Ramirez is believed to travel the country by  
hopping trains, railroad officers are joining the FBI, the Border 
Patrol and other law enforcement agencies in the manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Union Pacific officers regularly inspect trains and yards along  
the railway's routes in 23 states to catch people trying to ride 
the rails. In most cases, agents walk alongside trains, allowing 
dogs to sniff each car. 
</P>
<P>
	People have been known to hide inside fertilizer cars and amid  
foul-smelling industrial waste. But the dogs rarely miss a car 
where people are hiding, said John Brinning, the agent in charge of 
the Border Patrol station at Harlingen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Border Patrol pulls 500 illegal riders off trains each month  
in Harlingen, Brinning said. Across its territory, Union Pacific 
last year removed a total of 97,000 trespassers. 
</P>
<P>
	Railroad police for Fort Worth-based Burlington Northern Santa  
Fe Corp. also are working on the search.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Futures at 19-Month High  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures climbed to 19-month high Wednesday, moving  
within striking distance of $20 a barrel on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange, as weekly supply figures signaled world overproduction is 
coming to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, copper futures moved sharply higher, while  
pork futures continued their sharp retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude soared above $19 a barrel after the American Petroleum  
Institute and the U.S. Energy Department reported inventories fell 
for the eighth time in the last 11 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department reported inventories fell 1.7 million  
barrels to 330.40 million barrels, while the API reported a smaller 
488,000-barrel decline. 
</P>
<P>
	A year-to-year surplus in crude now has shrunk to a 3 percent  
deficit over this time a year ago, according to the API, helping 
reinforce a belief that world oil producers are sticking to 
commitments to reduce available supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and  
other top producers have shown unusual cooperation in reducing 
daily output. Much of that came after they saw their revenues 
tumble precipitously because of oversupply and weaker world demand, 
but some analysts have been surprised widespread cheating has not 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy products such as gasoline and distillates also were  
lifted by figures that indicated driving demand jumped to its 
highest in six weeks, to 9.06 million barrels of gasoline a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for August delivery rose 85 cents to $19.29 a barrel, its  
highest level since Nov. 26, 1997. July heating oil rose 2.03 cents 
to 47.85 cents a gallon; July unleaded gasoline rose 1.81 cents to 
55.62 cents a gallon; August natural gas fell 0.6 cent to $2.394 
for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures rocketed 7 percent on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange on news that mining company Phelps Dodge Corp. plans to 
slash annual production by 150 million pounds.

	The company said it planned to curtail operations indefinitely  
at its El Paso, Texas, refinery and shutdown at least temporarily 
its Hidalgo copper smelter in New Mexico and an Arizona 
concentrator, which processes materials that are then sent to 
smelters. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement heightened expectations that a global supply  
glut may be coming to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices have risen sharply over the past few sessions in  
reaction to Broken Hill Proprietary Co.'s decision to shutter its 
American mines in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian company is the world's second-largest copper  
producer, and market participants have fretted for months about 
whether it would take concrete steps to end falling prices. Several 
smaller producers already had moved to limit production, but the 
BHP decision helps remove several hundred thousand tons of copper 
from the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper prices have been in a slump as supply exceeds demand,  
partly because of overproduction and partly because of a slowdown 
in construction demand in Asia that came as a result of economic 
turmoil there. Copper is used in wiring and plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
	September high-grade copper rose 5.05 cents to 76.65 cents a  
pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures fell sharply again on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange as producers in Iowa and other major hog-producing states 
continued to slaughter animals at heavy rates in a bid to lock in 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department's quarterly report on the size  
of the nation's hog herd showed an unexpected increase in June, to 
60.54 million head from 59.89 million in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected the herd to fall below March's figure and  
by nearly 1 million head from a year earlier. Producers had been 
expected to have virtually eliminated oversupply by midyear in the 
face of tumbling prices. 
</P>
<P>
	August lean hogs fell 1.75 cents to 44.57 cents a pound; August  
pork bellies fell 2.47 cents to 36.85 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Madonna Sues Ex-Financial Advisers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Madonna has sued her former financial advisers  
for $2.5 million, apparently because she believes they caused her 
to lose more money to taxes than a material girl should put up 
with. 
</P>
<P>
	Madonna's lawsuit, filed Tuesday in State Supreme Court, charges  
Padell, Nadell, Fine, Weinberger &AMP; Co., and the firm's partners and 
associates, with breach of contract and fiduciary duties, and 
malpractice. 
</P>
<P>
	Bert Padell, the firm's senior partner, said the lawsuit stems  
from Madonna's having to pay $2 million in New York State income 
taxes after he prepared a 1992 tax filing saying she was a 
California resident. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state came in a said she was a New York State resident  
because she lived here more than 183 days'' in that tax year, and 
that made her subject to New York's income taxes, Padell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Padell said Madonna fired him in 1996 and hired a Los Angeles  
firm to handle her finances. He said Madonna paid the taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Padell said that Madonna may be upset with him, but he believes  
that ``she's a good person. I have no malice toward her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which names Madonna's personal corporation and her  
record company as plaintiffs, asks $2 million in compensatory 
damages and $500,000 in punitive damages.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Helps Blind Get Olympic Tix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Sydney Olympic organizers have opened a  
phone line to help blind people apply for tickets following a 
complaint to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint, lodged on behalf of Bruce Maguire, claimed  
discrimination because SOCOG had not provided a braille version of 
the official ticket book. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's interim finding required SOCOG to maintain  
Maguire's rights to apply for tickets after the July 16 deadline 
until a final determination could be made. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG denied there was discrimination and is discussing the  
decision with the commission. It has set up six phone lines to 
assist the vision impaired, with specially trained operators who 
can fill out ticket order forms and then mail them to applicants to 
be signed and returned. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG said Wednesday that it had been advised by the Royal Blind  
Society that documents were usually only published in braille if 
they were used for repeated reference. 
</P>
<P>
	A society spokesman said that only a few thousand of the  
approximately 300,000 legally blind people in Australia were 
braille readers.

<HEADLINE> Steering Probed on GM Pickups, SUVs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Highway Traffic Safety  
Administration is investigating some General Motors Corp. pickups 
and sport utility vehicles after motorist complaints of unexpected 
steering wheel movement they drove at moderate to high speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are C-K pickups and Suburban, Yukon and Tahoe sport  
utility vehicles from model years 1997-1999. GM and government 
officials say 1.5 million to 2 million of the vehicles are on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
	Government investigators said 76 motorists complained the  
vehicles' power steering assistance system is somehow involved in 
sudden oversteering during turns or lane changes and sometimes 
cause vehicles to veer out of the lane, according to the agency's 
monthly report on auto defects released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	There are four reports of crashes, the agency said.  
</P>
<P>
	GM spokesman Greg Martin said the company is cooperating with  
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency investigators are looking at whether a vehicle sensor is  
sending erroneous signals to the steering system. The so-called 
Electronically Variable Orifice sensor detects rapid steering wheel 
movements that indicate emergency maneuvering of the vehicle. A 
steering system, called the Variable Effort Steering system, then 
provides full power steering to help the driver. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has told the agency the system was designed to improve  
drivers' feel of the road when steering. ``It is GM's position that 
there is no effect on vehicle control, and therefore this is not a 
safety issue,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	About one-third of the motorists complained about a jerking  
motion in the wheel or momentary oversteering, while others 
complained about unexpected veering from the travel lane.

<HEADLINE> Michael Ondaatje Returns to Poetry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Michael Ondaatje, internationally acclaimed  
author, is seated on a rustic-looking bench in a small parking lot. 
He has stopped by to say hello to his friends at Coach House Books, 
an alternative publisher that issued his first book more than 30 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach House is a kind of touchstone for me,'' says the  
55-year-old Ondaatje, who started as a poet and now serves on the 
Coach House board of directors. ``It's a place that's haphazard and 
amateurish in a nice sort of way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time has changed Ondaatje more than this place, a converted  
coach house, fittingly, where the green front door still appears to 
be working off its original coat of paint. Ondaatje's leonine head 
of hair has turned from dark to gray, and he has evolved from a 
little-known poet to a little-known novelist to a well-known 
novelist, published by Alfred A. Knopf. 
</P>
<P>
	``The English Patient,'' which came out in 1992, brought  
Ondaatje the Booker prize for fiction. Five years later the film 
adaptation won nine Academy Awards and helped the book sell a 
million copies. He now has what few writers dare imagine: fame, 
money, respect and first-hand stories about movie stars. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite memories of Cannes and conversations with Ralph  
Fiennes, who starred in the film, Ondaatje remains committed to 
poetry, even if no one is making movies about it. Like a director 
who follows a smash hit with an experimental film, his first 
publication since ``The English Patient'' is a volume of poetry, 
``Handwriting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I really wanted to get back to a form I had not written in for  
a long time,'' Ondaatje said. ``One of the lucky things that 
happened with `The English Patient' is that I could do what I 
wanted to do, what I should do. It's a huge gift you shouldn't 
ignore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poems in ``Handwriting,'' published by Knopf, are set mostly  
in his native Sri Lanka. Only briefly does he refer to the current 
civil war. Otherwise, his subjects include love, a woodpecker, a 
10th-century princess, the long history of a Buddhist statue and a 
family of stilt-walkers crossing a field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sri Lanka has been reduced in the media to a country full of  
race riots and civil war,'' he said. ``But at the same time it's a 
country with a culture. It's not just represented by politicians 
but by people who live their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If only on paper, he is trying to bring back a forgotten  
civilization. In ``Buried 2,'' he lists some of the casualties over 
the centuries: the art of eye-painting, the interior love poem, how 
to cut an arrow, how to touch a master's feet, ``nine finger and 
eye gestures/to signal key emotions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his poem ``The Story'' Ondaatje recalls the ancient legend  
that a child's first 40 days are filled by ``dreams of previous 
lives'' and then all is forgotten. There is something lost to 
everyone, he is saying. We must improvise the past as we go along. 
And the author's own past calls for the resources of a jazz master. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in 1943, Ondaatje is of Dutch, English, Sinhalese and Tamil  
descent. As described in his memoir, ``Running in the Family,'' his 
childhood was an Eastern version of ``The Great Gatsby.'' Both 
parents came from a long line of prominent families. They were 
wealthy, irresponsible and unhappy. They danced and drank and 
eventually divorced. 
</P>
<P>
	``During certain hours, at certain years in our lives, we see  
ourselves as remnants from the earlier generations that were 
destroyed,'' he wrote in his memoir. 
</P>
<P>
	Ondaatje emigrated to London when he was 11. Unhappy with the  
strict rules of British education, he moved on to Canada in the 
early 1960s. The search for home has tormented endless writers, but 
Ondaatje is happy to be an exile. Displacement, he has decided, is 
good for the imagination. The less you really know, the more you 
can make up. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who live in the same town all their lives have a stable  
location; it's easier for them to re-create a time,'' said 
Ondaatje, who lives in Toronto with his wife, novelist Linda 
Spalding. ``I had sort of a scattered childhood. It was like living 
three or four lives, which is in fact the lives a lot of us have 
these days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote poetry at Bishop's University, in Quebec, and was soon  
introduced to the Coach House staff by poet Wayne Clifford. His 
first collection, ``The Dainty Monsters,'' came out in 1967. 
``Billy the Kid,'' released three years later, was his first 
``prose'' work, a modernist collage of narrative, poetry, 
photographs and newspaper excerpts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I admired, and also envied, the kind of liberties he felt  
entitled to take,'' said author Russell Banks, a friend of 
Ondaatje's since the 1970s. ``The different kinds of texts -- 
historical and personal -- and the different styles, poetry and 
prose. There weren't many writers who were experimenting in a way 
that was very interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another poem from ``Handwriting,'' Ondaatje observes: ``We  
began with myths and later included actual events.'' Before 
tell-all books and the Information Age, it was up to fiction 
writers to inform us about private lives. They imagined how people 
loved, hated, dreamed and died. The historian's darkness was the 
novelist's freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	For his own stories, Ondaatje explores the pre-television past.  
``The English Patient'' is set during World War II and its 
predecessor, ``In the Skin of a Lion,'' covers the '20s and '30s. 
His first two novels, ``Billy the Kid'' and ``Coming Through 
Slaughter,'' take place around the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	``History is essential to us, but the kind of history given to  
us, or at least to me, is a kind of official history: kings and 
brigadiers and all this stuff,'' he said. ``I wanted to write books 
about people who were not historical, who were there and witnessing 
history but were never there in the history books.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His characters are sometimes famous, but still mysterious. In  
``The Collected Works of Billy the Kid,'' Ondaatje puts himself in 
the mind of the legendary outlaw. ``Coming Through Slaughter'' 
constructs the life of jazz pioneer Buddy Bolden, a coronetist who 
went mad in a parade and was institutionalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up in Sri Lanka loving Westerns and wanting to be a  
cowboy, if you can believe that,'' Ondaatje said. ``And in England, 
I wanted to be a jazz musician. Both of those desires were in me. 
</P>
<P>
	``So when I wrote `Billy the Kid,' it was my way of writing a  
Western. In `Coming Through Slaughter,' it was something about 
jazz, going mad in parade, that got me going. There was very little 
discovered about Bolden so it became a kind of improvisation, 
pulling out fragments of archival things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even within his books, characters compose stories, their own  
stories. They share them with friends, like the lovers in ``In the 
Skin of a Lion.'' They share them with strangers, as in ``The 
English Patient,'' when the burned pilot confides to his nurse. 
They're like archaeologists of their own past, using stories to 
discover who they are. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Sri Lanka, there was an oral tradition. There were very few  
books about Sri Lanka so the main way to learn about something was 
through the stories you heard at the dinner table or at the bar. 
And those stories were finessed and expanded and exaggerated until 
they became fiction,'' Ondaatje said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been fascinated by stories. There are people who  
can't express themselves directly, so they do it through stories. 
It's protection. We all tell stories that defend us in some way 
against nothingness.''

<HEADLINE> Kirkpatrick Ticketed Over Dog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Former United Nations ambassador Jeane M.  
Kirkpatrick was ticketed for locking her poodle in her car with all 
the windows rolled up on a hot summer day. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kirkpatrick, former U.N. ambassador under President Reagan,  
was shopping at some boutiques in downtown Bethesda on Saturday 
when she left her dog ``Jasper'' behind in 90-degree weather. 
</P>
<P>
	A police officer issued Ms. Kirkpatrick a $45 ticket for  
violating a state motors vehicle law that forbids leaving animals 
in locked cars, the Montgomery County police said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, GOP presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole named Ms.  
Kirkpatrick as her principal foreign policy adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kirkpatrick, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise  
Institute, endorsed Mrs. Dole in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kirkpatrick's spokeswoman at the institute did not  
immediately return a call for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Kessler, executive director of the Montgomery County  
Humane Society, said Ms. Kirkpatrick probably didn't know the 
dangers of leaving a dog in a locked car on a hot day. ``The animal 
can die within a very few minutes,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Voters Pick Prison in Vermont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Astronomers say a new state prison  
narrowly approved by voters will pollute the sky with light and 
spoil the view of the heavens from an 80-year-old observatory. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters on Tuesday approved the prison in Springfield by a margin  
of 69 votes, 1,633 to 1,564. The state must now acquire land and 
obtain environmental permits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels like a death to me. I feel like something is about to  
be destroyed,'' said Maryann Arrien, an amateur astronomer who is 
president of the Springfield Telescope Makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Arrien, whose group maintains the hilltop observatory three  
miles from the proposed site of the 350-bed state prison, wept 
after hearing of the vote's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	The observatory is a national landmark known as Stellafane --  
Latin for ``Shrine to the Stars.'' It is the site of a conference 
that attracts more than 2,000 amateur astronomers every summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the mother of observatories for amateur telescoping,''  
said Ms. Arrien, whose group collected 700 signatures on a petition 
against the prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said Springfield, which is in southeastern Vermont on  
the New Hampshire line and has a population of about 10,000, needs 
the help and the 160 jobs the prison would bring. The city is 65 
miles south of Montpelier. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials said the prison lights would not ruin star  
viewing and noted there are small towns that are closer to the 
observatory than the prison would be. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Howard Dean said he didn't know enough about the lighting  
of the proposed prison to comment. He welcomed the outcome of the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the opponents, Dean said: ``I think it'll turn out that  
their fears are unfounded.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve raised interest rates  
today for the first time in two years, hoping to slow the red-hot 
U.S. economy by making it more expensive for American consumers and 
businesses to borrow. The Fed announced it was increasing its 
target for the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge 
each other on overnight loans, by a quarter-point to 5 percent. The 
announcement led to an immediate jump in stock prices. Just before 
4 p.m. EDT, the Dow was up 158.94 to 10,974.29 after being down 
more than 80 earlier today. Advancing issues on the New York Stock

Fortier. A three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals ordered a new sentencing hearing for Fortier, who pleaded 
guilty to failing to alert authorities to the bomb plot, helping 
Timothy McVeigh sell stolen weapons and lying to the FBI.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and Canada signed an  
agreement today aimed at protecting and building up dwindling 
Pacific salmon supplies. The Pacific Salmon Treaty, agreed to after 
five years of tough negotiations and years of disputes between U.S. 
and Canadian fishermen, revises a 1985 agreement to rebuild wild 
salmon runs and ensure that both sides get a fair share of the

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved new abortion restrictions  
today by voting to make it more difficult for a minor to end a 
pregnancy. Under a bill adopted 270-159, anyone who avoids parental 
involvement laws by taking a pregnant girl out of state for an 
abortion could be prosecuted in federal court. But the vote was 
more than a dozen short of the required two-thirds majority, or 286 
votes, needed to overturn a threatened White House veto.

five years, it's over. Our lives can begin again,'' Hubbell said 
outside the courthouse after being sentenced to one year of

<HEADLINE> Rangers Catcher Rodriguez Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- All-Star catcher Ivan Rodriguez of the  
Texas Rangers had to be helped off the field after spraining his 
left knee on a baserunning play Wednesday night against the Anaheim 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez will have an MRI on Thursday back in Texas.  
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers were leading 11-0 in the fifth inning when Rodriguez  
led off the fifth with a slow-bouncing ball to third baseman Jeff 
Huson. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, who ducked just as he reached first base to avoid  
getting hit by the throw, appeared to jam his left knee as he hit 
the bag and was called out. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez's momentum carried him into short right field, where  
he fell to the ground and grimaced in pain before help arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-time All-Star and seven-time Gold Glove winner began  
the night with a .307 average, 13 homers and 46 RBIs. But he has 
been slumping at the plate because of recent back problems that has 
been plaguing him since the Rangers' June 14 game against the New 
York Yankees.

<HEADLINE> P&AMP;G To End Product Tests on Animals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., the maker of Crest,  
Tide, Pampers and Ivory soap, said Wednesday it will immediately 
stop using animals to test many of its household products. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G made exceptions for its current food and pharmaceutical  
products and for any new products. In some cases, animal testing is 
required by law, and P&AMP;G said such practices will continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Animal-rights activists have made the worldwide consumer  
products company a target for years, with a boycott of P&AMP;G products 
beginning in 1989. They have thrown cream pies at P&AMP;G's chairman, 
been arrested at the Cincinnati headquarters and spoofed P&AMP;G's Tide 
detergent-sponsored race car with a similarly decorated auto with 
the logo ``Died.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Games, P&AMP;G vice president of global product safety, said  
the new policy is effective immediately in the more than 140 
countries in which P&AMP;G operates. 
</P>
<P>
	``This announcement covers roughly 80 percent of P&AMP;G's total  
product portfolio, including color cosmetics, shampoos and 
hairstyling products, skin care products, tissue and towel 
products, laundry and dishwashing detergents and household 
cleaners,'' P&AMP;G said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Science has advanced to the point that non-animal testing  
methods can be relied on to ensure that these products are safe for 
people, Games said. P&AMP;G said, for example, that if it were to 
reformulate a product, it could do so by relying on previous animal 
data. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G has spent almost $100 million during the past 15 years to  
study alternatives to animal testing, Games said. 
</P>
<P>
	People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, one of the  
organizations that have tried to get P&AMP;G to end animal testing, 
said the announcement is a small step forward, but more needs to be 
done. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization will take its ``Died'' car off the road and  
refocus its boycott on new P&AMP;G products, said Mary Beth Sweetland, 
a PETA vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Animal testing will still be a sorry part of any new product  
P&AMP;G puts out,'' she said from PETA headquarters in Norfolk, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer product manufacturers such as Dial, Gillette and Mary  
Kay cosmetics have already agreed to end animal testing, Ms. 
Sweetland said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration requires animal testing on  
pharmaceuticals, Ms. Sweetland said. PETA has never asked companies 
to violate such requirements, she said.

<HEADLINE> Copper Producer To Lay Off 1,650 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Phelps Dodge Corp., one of the world's largest  
copper producers plans to cut back operations and lay off 1,650 
workers because of the continuing worldwide slump in prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts predict the move could signal a slight surge in prices  
by the end of the year, but could also prompt other copper 
companies to trim employees and operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have an eight-footed monster ready to drop a lot of  
shoes,'' said George Leaming, a Marana, Ariz., mining analyst, 
noting Australian conglomerate Broken Hill Proprietary Co.'s 
decision last week to close its copper operations in Arizona and 
Nevada this fall and eliminate 2,630 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge's cutbacks were necessary because of ``the  
potential of an extended downtown in the price of copper and 
significant change and uncertainty in key global markets for wire 
and cable,'' said Douglas Yearley, the Phoenix-based company's 
chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for copper, which is widely used in wiring and plumbing,  
have slid from $1.18 per pound in 1996 to an average of 65 cents 
this year, partly because of overproduction and partly because of a 
slowdown in construction demand in Asia from economic turmoil in 
that country. 
</P>
<P>
	Yearley said the moves would reduce Phelp Dodge's projected  
mining costs by almost 4 cents per pound, eliminate about $30 
million in capital expenditures in its mining operations and cut 
copper production by an average of 150 million pounds per year. 
</P>
<P>
	That comes on top of BHP's decision that will remove several  
hundred thousand tons of copper from the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor Lazarovici, senior metals and mining analyst for the  
Nesbitt Burns brokerage firm in New York, was not surprised by the 
move. ``I think Phelps Dodge has been headed in this direction for 
some time. ... The fundamental reason is copper at 65 cents or so a 
pound is not a price that's acceptable on a long-term basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``A turnaround is not going to happen immediately, but it might  
over time, Lazarovici added. ``I think we'll see higher average 
copper prices in the third and fourth quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I don't think this is the last announcement we'll see  
(from copper companies trimming operations and work forces). 
There's still a few more out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures have been higher this week on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange amid hopes that the global glut will finally be 
easing, trading Wednesday at 75.95 cents per pound. 
</P>
<P>
	During the third quarter, Phelps Dodge said it will temporarily  
close its smelter at Hidalgo, N.M., and the smaller of two 
concentrators at its Morenci, Ariz., mining complex. The company 
also will slice production in half at its copper refinery in El 
Paso, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Those closures and curtailments would result in the elimination  
of approximately 900 jobs, including 250 at Morenci, Yearley said. 
Another 670 jobs would be eliminated as Phelps Dodge curtails its 
wire and cable operations.

<HEADLINE> Sports Writer Harold Rosenthal Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Harold Rosenthal, a sports writer  
and author who covered baseball and football in a career that 
spanned five decades, died from complications following a stroke. 
He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenthal, who died Tuesday, worked for more than three decades  
for the New York Herald Tribune, and was especially noted for his 
baseball coverage from 1947 through 1963. He reported on games of 
the Giants, Dodgers, Yankees and Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	When the newspaper went out of business in 1966, Rosenthal moved  
into public relations, first with the Continental Football League. 
After working briefly for the New York Giants, he became public 
relations director of the American Football League and, when it 
merged with the NFL, he served as director of information for the 
American Football Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He left the NFL in 1974 and worked briefly as public relations  
director of New American Library. He was also managing editor of 
Weekend Sports, a television sports newspaper supplement, and 
contributed to many magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote columns for the New York City Tribune from 1978-1991  
and appeared in a number of HBO and ESPN documentaries on baseball 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenthal was a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers Hall of Fame and  
author of a number of books, including ``Baseball Is Their 
Business'' and ``The Ten Best Years of Baseball.'' In football, he 
wrote ``Fifty Faces of Football'' and ``Playing Pro Football to 
Win,'' with Johnny Unitas. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in the Army Air Force during World War II.  
</P>
<P>
	An lifetime member of the Baseball Writers Association and  
former president of the New York Football Writers Association, he 
is survived by his wife of 58 years, Alice, a daughter, Jane Ann 
Neff, and a granddaughter. A son, Jonas, died in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Stronger Consumer Privacy Laws Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Key Democratic lawmakers are pushing for  
tighter restrictions on the business practice of sharing customer 
financial data as the House nears a vote on measures designed to 
protect consumers' privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer and privacy advocacy groups, meanwhile, pressed  
President Clinton to get involved in the congressional privacy 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is critical that Congress act now. ... We urge you to tell  
Congress to (enact) the protections for personal privacy,'' a 
coalition of groups, including the Consumer Federation of America, 
Consumers Union, U.S. Public Interest Research Group and the 
Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, said in a letter to Clinton released 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanging in the balance is legislation that would remove  
Depression-era barriers between banks, securities firms and 
insurance companies, allowing them to merge. The House was expected 
to vote in a few days on the package, which would include the 
consumer privacy provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic amendment, recently adopted in a surprise move by  
the House Commerce Committee, would allow consumers to stop banks, 
securities firms and other financial service companies from sharing 
their personal data with affiliated or outside companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The alternative provision being pushed by the Republican  
leadership would allow consumers to block companies from selling 
the data to outside firms, such as telemarketers, but not from 
sharing it with affiliated companies under the same corporate 
parent. 
</P>
<P>
	Key Democrats, who support the financial overhaul legislation,  
threatened to vote against the bill if it did not contain the 
stricter privacy amendment they were pushing. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, ``it will only be half a bill,'' Rep. Edward  
Markey, D-Mass., principal author of the amendment, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Markey and other Democratic lawmakers objected to Republican  
leaders barring their amendment from a House vote in favor of one 
more acceptable to the financial services industries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic lawmakers were joined by a Republican, Rep. Joe  
Barton of Texas, who said he and other GOP lawmakers also would 
vote against a financial overhaul package without the stricter 
privacy measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the measures, ``There is real doubt whether the bill  
passes,'' Barton said. ``That's something the (financial) industry 
needs to think about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The banking, securities and insurance industries, which have  
lobbied for financial overhaul legislation for years, say inclusion 
of stringent privacy amendments would kill their support for the 
House bill. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the House Rules Committee, which reflects the  
views of the Republican leadership, said a final decision hadn't 
been made on which privacy amendment would be voted on by the full 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	``The importance of protecting consumer privacy is a view that  
is widely shared,'' said the spokesman, Richard Mills. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed a financial overhaul package in early May on a  
mostly party-line vote of 54-44. The Clinton administration 
supports such legislation in principle but has threatened to veto 
the Senate version unless there were major changes, including the 
removal of provisions that Democrats viewed as an attack on the 
1977 Community Reinvestment Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton recently urged Congress to bolster consumers' rights  
when banks and other financial companies seek to share information 
about them.

<HEADLINE> Black Sect Pledges To Cooperate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EATONTON, Ga. (AP) -- A mostly black religious group whose  
spiritual leader claims to be an extraterrestrial pledged greater 
cooperation with anxious neighbors and local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors, who claim to be descended  
from Egyptians, occupy a 476-acre tract in Putman County east of 
Atlanta. After a two-hour meeting on Tuesday, called by a judge 
hearing a contempt case, group leader Dwight York said he is 
optimistic he and county offiicials can resolve their disputes over 
zoning and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Peace is made,'' York said to cheers from hundreds of  
supporters who filled the courtroom or stood in the rain and prayed 
on the courthouse lawn. Hundreds of law enforcement officers were 
also on hand, as well as a helicopter and an armored personnel 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuwaubians have said their difficulties with the  
predominantly white county stem from discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	The group arrived in 1993 from New York City and has since  
constructed a 40-foot-high black pyramid with statues of Egyptian 
gods and goddesses on the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	York had been charged with contempt of court after armed guards  
prevented the sheriff and county building inspector from entering 
the community to carry out a court order in April. The county had 
filed several lawsuits accusing the Nuwaubians of violating zoning 
and building regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Hostilities intensified to the point where representatives from  
the Department of Justice tried to intervene to mediate, and Gov. 
Roy Barnes called the sheriff for a briefing on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	At Tuesday's court hearing, York declined to answer where he  
lived and invoked his Fifth Amendment right against 
self-incrimination. That prompted Judge Hugh Wingfield III to ask 
everyone but the principals to clear the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to move beyond the contempt hearings and get to the  
meat of the matter,'' Wingfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Goldberg, one of York's lawyers, said the Nuwaubians would  
go forward with the permitting process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agreed to stop attacking each other, and, for lack of a  
better word, we aired some concerns,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wingfield did not rule on the contempt charge against York.  
</P>
<P>
	York has claimed he's from another galaxy and promises that  
ships are going to descend from the sky in the year 2003 to pick up 
a chosen 144,000 people for rebirth as supreme beings. 
</P>
<P>
	Such predictions about spacecraft remind some of the group's  
neighbors of the Heaven's Gate sect in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., who 
committed mass suicide in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Workers Protest at DKNY Offices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- About 50 garment workers and their supporters  
protested outside the Manhattan headquarters of designer Donna 
Karan on Wednesday, claiming that seamstresses were mistreated at a 
factory that was contracted to manufacture her dresses. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from Donna Karan International asserted that the  
designer's firm ``does not own or operate any factories. This is a 
personal dispute between a unionized contract manufacturer and some 
of its employees. We have absolutely nothing to do with their 
employment or working conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several women who said they had worked in the factory in the  
Garment Center told reporters the bathroom was locked to keep them 
from using it, they were not allowed to make or receive emergency 
phone calls, they were forced to keep their heads bent over their 
work, and they were not paid overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers also said they were subject to various racist rules.  
Hispanic women were allegedly restricted to sewing by hand because 
they were told they would break the machines, while Chinese women 
were allegedly restricted to using the machines after being told 
that their eyes weren't big enough to do good handwork. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we lifted our heads, they would shout at us. They never  
paid us overtime, even though we worked 60 hours a week,'' said 
Lupe Santos. ``We, the Latin workers, were especially discriminated 
against. They never let us touch the sewing machines. They said we 
would destroy them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The factory was contracted to produce dresses with the designer  
label. Protesters said it operated under the names Choe Ltd. 
Couture Enterprises Ltd. and Eastpoint International, but closed 
several months ago. It is not unusual for garment factory owners to 
close and reopen several days later under a different name or in a 
different location. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it too much to ask DKNY to show some social  
consciousness?'' asked Mabel Tso, a spokeswoman for National 
Mobilization Against Sweatshops, which organized the protest. 
``Donna Karan says, 'We don't know what goes on in our factories. 
It's not our fault.' Well, it is your responsibility. We are 
insisting the factory be reopened and these workers rehired.''

<P>
	NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- Computer hackers disabled the Web site of  
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Storm 
Prediction Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Weather trackers, including emergency management officials  
nationwide, had to look elsewhere for storm data Tuesday as agency 
technicians worked to fix the Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is an unofficial way to distribute that  
information, but a lot of people have come to rely on it,'' said 
Joe Schaefer, director of the Storm Prediction Center. ``It's a 
quick, easy way to get data.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The site was expected to be back online today.  
</P>
<P>
	A group calling itself the ``Keebler Elves'' changed the Web  
page to read, ``Learn to fear the elite,'' and issued a ``welcome 
back'' message to a hacker group that claimed responsibility for a 
similar attack earlier this week on the U.S. Army's main Internet 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI is investigating both incidents.  
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's attack was the second against the storm prediction  
center this month. Two weeks ago, hackers infiltrated the agency's 
telephone system and made long-distance calls overseas, Schaefer 
said.

<HEADLINE> Twins Manager Kelly Snubs Umpire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Minnesota manager Tom Kelly, upset over two  
calls by Greg Kosc the previous night, snubbed the umpire prior to 
Wednesday night's game against the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of participating in the pregame meeting between the  
umpires and both managers, Kelly simply handed his lineup card to 
plate umpire Kosc, then turned and jogged back to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	The normally mild-mannered Kelly delivered a postgame tirade to  
reporters after Tuesday night's 5-4 loss to the Indians. He was 
furious about two calls made by Kosc at first base. 
</P>
<P>
	The first was a seventh-inning pickoff of the Twins' Doug  
Mientkiewicz. Kelly was even more irate when Kosc called 
Cleveland's Roberto Alomar safe on a bunt play in the Indians' 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	``You saw the game, you watched the replays,'' Kelly said after  
the game. ``Tell me Mientkiewicz was out. Was he? Yes or no? How 
about Alomar?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to Wednesday night's game, Kelly said he was ``still  
fuming'' over the calls.

<HEADLINE> Gene Links Cancer Risk to Blacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Genetic mutations identified in some blacks  
have been found to increase their risk for cancer of the colon and 
rectum, a new study says. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding by researchers from Roswell Park Cancer Institute  
could help in early diagnosis of such cancers. 
</P>
<P>
	While similar links between colorectal cancer and specific  
genetic mutations have already been established among a handful of 
nationalities and ethnic groups, the new study was the first to 
focus on blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The results are published in the latest Journal of the American  
Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's third-leading cause of cancer deaths, colorectal  
cancer is expected to strike 129,400 people in the United States 
this year and kill 55,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks suffer higher rates of cancer of the colon and rectum  
than other racial and ethnic groups and die more frequently from 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the researchers said the genetic alterations are  
probably not an explanation for the higher death rate: that is 
largely attributable to late-stage diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, regular screening for cancer is essential, said Dr.  
Thomas Weber, who led the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything we can do to help identify who's at risk and direct  
clinical surveillance to those people would be very helpful,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite easy take-home tests, only about 40 percent of Americans  
over the age of 50 are screened regularly for colorectal cancer, 
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roswell Park research, done over the past two years, looked  
at 11 unrelated black colorectal cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The study determined that defects of the so-called ``mismatch  
repair'' genes, which normally repair DNA in cells that fail to 
replicate properly, contribute to hereditary nonpolyposis 
colorectal cancer, a specific type. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Cancer Society recommends that men and women 50 or  
older get tested annually to detect cancers of the colon or rectum. 
Screening should begin earlier for people with a strong family 
history of cancer.

<HEADLINE> China 2, Russia 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- China shot. And shot. And shot some  
more. 
</P>
<P>
	Although China, a tournament favorite, beat Russia 2-0 Wednesday  
night in the Women's World Cup quarterfinals, the score didn't 
reflect the incredibly one-sided game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our overall objective was not to win, but just to not concede  
too many goals,'' said Russian coach Yurii Bystritzkii. ``The 
Chinese are in a different class from us. It would have been 
senseless for us to open up the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Russia -- playing in its first World Cup -- played  
defense for almost the entire 90 minutes while China pounded away. 
</P>
<P>
	The expected success moves China into a semifinal match Sunday  
at Foxboro, Mass., against Norway, a 3-1 winner over Sweden in 
Wednesday's late game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking forward to our next match,'' said China's coach  
Ma Yuanan. ``We are not going to lose and go back to Beijing. We 
will fight until the last minute of this tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That certainly seemed to be the case Wednesday. The Chinese  
peppered Russian goalkeeper Svetlana Petko with 24 shots and the 
Russians, surprise quarterfinalists in their first World Cup, got 
off only two shots while spending most of the time chasing China's 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's strongest attacker, Irina Grigorieva, who led the  
tournament going into the game with four assists, was stymied with 
defensive duty back in her own penalty box. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese midfielder Pu Wei was the first to score, kicking a  
slow, bouncing shot from outside the penalty box late in the first 
half. Petko, perhaps exhausted from about a dozen earlier saves, 
reacted late and watched the ball slide past the tips of her 
gloves. 
</P>
<P>
	The baby of the Chinese team at 18, Pu fell to her knees,  
thrilled with her first World Cup goal, before jumping up in glee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't the best shot I ever made, but I was obviously very  
excited because it was my first in the tournament,'' said Pu. 
</P>
<P>
	China scored again 10 minutes into the second half when Jin Yan  
knocked in the rebound of a shot that bounced off the post. 
</P>
<P>
	Ma said his players probably should have scored a few more  
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We overwhelmed the Russian team, but we missed some chances to  
score. That's something we need to improve,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian loss was not unexpected. The team was one of the  
surprises in the tournament, advancing from its group with 
victories over Japan and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's defenders used an array of strong tactics to keep China  
from running up the score, pushing beyond the usual slide tackles 
and tight marking. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 16th minute, Russian defender Natalia Karasseva was  
carried off the field on a stretcher after being cracked across the 
face diving to head a ball clear of the goal. After an ice pack and 
some rest, she returned to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the first half, Tatiana Tcheverda was penalized with a  
yellow card when she batted the ball away with her hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26,000-capacity Spartan Stadium had a crowd of 21,411.

	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Petter Villegas scored the tying  
goal in regulation and then added a score in the shootout Wednesday 
night as the New York-New Jersey MetroStars snapped a six-game 
Major League Soccer losing streak with a 2-1 shootout victory over 
the Tampa Bay Mutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory snapped a club-record losing streak for the  
MetroStars (5-10). Tampa Bay (6-9) has lost four straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay scored two minutes into the second half when Alejandro  
Sequiera converted Carlos Valderrama's pass into a chip shot over 
MetroStars goalkeeper Tim Howard. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-New Jersey knotted the issue in the 73rd minute on  
Villegas' first MLS goal, a shot from the top of the arc that 
whistled past Mutiny keeper Andy Kirk and into the upper right 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-New Jersey won the shootout as Tab Ramos, Villegas and  
Billy Walsh scored against Kirk. Pete Marino and Steve Ralston 
scored for the Mutiny, but Howard saved shots by R.T. Moore, Paul 
Dougherty and Valderrama to preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars missed an opportunity to win the match in  
regulation when Nansha Kalonji's header bounced over the bar in the 
82nd minute.

<HEADLINE> La Russa Thinks McGee Can Manage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Someday soon, Willie McGee might move from the  
outfield to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	As McGee's career winds down and he spends more time on the  
bench watching the game and bouncing ideas off Tony La Russa, he's 
getting a feel for what it would be like to be in charge. 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa gives him an unqualified endorsement, and McGee is  
intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see myself doing it, but this man has been doing it  
for a long time and that makes me feel good that he thinks I'm 
capable of doing it,'' the 40-yea-old outfielder said. ``I love the 
game, in any capacity. Whether it's coaching, playing, whatever it 
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa said McGee has served an apprenticeship of sorts as an  
unofficial coach since the Cardinals reacquired the former NL MVP 
in 1996. Young players constantly seek him out for advice, and even 
contemporaries like Eric Davis, 36, want to know what makes him 
tick. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of those guys who asks a lot of questions, and that's  
probably why he's been picking my brain,'' Davis said. ``I pick his 
brain as well. I think it's easy for him to talk to me because I've 
been around for so long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis thinks McGee would be an excellent manager.  
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely,'' he said. ``He's knowledgeable about the game, he  
has great instincts, and he communicates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also is certain to get an endorsement from the fans. He is  
probably the team's most beloved player. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest question is whether McGee, almost painfully media  
shy, could stomach daily question-and-answer sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it'd be his favorite thing,'' La Russa joked. ``That,  
and making appearances at writers' dinners and standing up and 
speaking. But I'll tell you, never underestimate Willie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGee is pleased that La Russa thinks enough of him to discuss  
strategy. He said Whitey Herzog, who managed him during his glory 
years with the Cardinals, and Dusty Baker, whom he played for in 
San Francisco, also would be role models. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker gave McGee a book called ``The Art of War,'' so he could  
soak up some tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important part, it seems, is managing your bullpen,''  
McGee said. ``The players, pretty much you put them out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGee is playing less these days. Before Wednesday's game with  
the Astros, he had 136 at-bats the first 76 games. He had 309 and 
300 at-bats his first two years in his second tour with the 
Cardinals, and 269 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa has used him as a pinch hitter 19 times, making for  
lots of dead time. McGee is trying to make the most of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're playing, you're involved in the game so you don't  
really have time to understand what the infielders are doing,'' 
McGee said. ``I've had time now to understand situations, how the 
game works and how it flows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGee has been hinting at retirement for several years, but he's  
not tipping his hand about his plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm day to day,'' he said. ``I don't know what's going to  
happen. But that time is coming.''

<HEADLINE> Newest Aussie Export: The Wiggles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Down Under-United States entertainment  
connection brought Olivia Newton-John to American stardom. Same for 
``Crocodile Dundee'' and Mel Gibson. Let's now give a welcome to 
the Wiggles, a goofy new import from Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wiggles are four effervescent performers from the Sydney  
area: Anthony Field, Murray Cook, Jeff Fatt and Greg Page. Each 
wears a special color: blue, red, yellow or purple. Set loose on a 
recent five-week tour of New York, Florida, Virginia and Texas, 
they wowed the preschool set with their wild antics. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really special,'' said Field in a telephone interview  
from Texas. ``If this is all I did for the rest of my life, I'd be 
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His group had kids howling with joy with routines involving  
Dorothy the Dinosaur, Henry the Octopus and Wags the Dog. A running 
gag where Fatt always falls asleep is especially popular with the 6 
and younger set: 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone yells, ``Wake up Jeff!'' Dutifully, in show after show,  
Fatt wakes with a start and a big grin. Kids never seem to tire of 
it, Field said. 
</P>
<P>
	While relatively new to the American scene, the Wiggles seem to  
be on to something, judging by kids' reactions to the group's 
belly-slapping shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Kids sing and laugh to the ``Monkey Dance,'' ``Numbers Rhumba,''  
``Hot Potato'' and ``Fruit Salad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The songs really work anywhere,'' said Field.  
</P>
<P>
	Six of the Wiggles' videos have reached multiplatinum status in  
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	And ``The Wiggles Movie'' was the second highest-grossing film  
in Australia in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty mind-boggling,'' said Field, 36, explaining how  
three of the Wiggles got degrees in early childhood education, 
began fooling around in 1991, and cut a record they thought might 
appeal to kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took it to a record company, thinking nothing of it. It  
started really selling. In Australia, the Wiggles is like really 
huge. We could play there all year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. tour included performances at various Sea World and  
Busch Gardens locations and the Jacob Javits Convention Center in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Field said he was overwhelmed by what he saw as the Wiggles  
traveled the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so slow in Australia compared to here,'' Field said.  
``Even the roads are smaller. And the supermarkets are huge! It's 
pretty wild. Like New York, it's so huge and fast, on the edge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Page admitted that he missed his wife and children.  
</P>
<P>
	He also confessed: ``I've been driving on the wrong side of the  
road!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wiggles will release two videos in the United States this  
fall: ``Yummy Yummy'' and ``Wiggle Time,'' hoping to capitalize on 
their U.S. tour and their 30-minute ``The Wiggles'' program, which 
is shown weekday mornings on the Fox Family Channel.

<HEADLINE> Cornwell Gives $1.5M to Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Crime writer Patricia Cornwell has given  
$1.5 million to help the state create an institute to train 
forensic scientists and pathologists. 
</P>
<P>
	The state forensic lab building in Richmond will be the home of  
the new Virginia Institute of Forensic Science and Medicine. The 
first class of 10 students will begin studies next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a direct way to fight against the very thing I hate so  
much -- violence against people,'' Cornwell said Tuesday. ``I 
envision this as becoming the Johns Hopkins of forensic science and 
medical training. I want it to be an international learning 
center.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state forensic lab is where Cornwell picked up many of the  
details for her novels. Her Kay Scarpetta character was inspired by 
Dr. Marcella Fierro, Virginia's chief medical examiner.

<HEADLINE> Gillette Fights Rivals in Courtroom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A new front has opened in the shaving wars between  
Gillette and its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has sued rival American Safety Razor in U.S.  
District Court, charging the company's Tri-Flexxx three-bladed 
razor infringes on Gillette's patent for the Mach3 razor and uses 
deceptive advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	In the suit filed last month against American Safety Razor of  
Verona, Va., Gillette claims Tri-Flexxx, a cheaper triple-blade 
razor, copied elements of Mach3's distinctive packaging. It also 
accuses Tri-Flexxx of infringing on several of its razor patents 
and running misleading advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	It's far from the first time Gillette has sued a commercial  
adversary. 
</P>
<P>
	The personal care giant filed a lawsuit against Norelco Consumer  
Products in October 1996, claiming it ran false and disparaging 
commercials depicting traditional wet razors as ferocious 
serpent-like creatures. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Gillette's Duracell division sued Ralston Purina  
claiming an ad campaign for Energizer batteries falsely denigrates 
the performance of Duracell batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would much prefer to compete in the marketplace,'' said  
Eric Kraus, Gillette spokesman, on Wednesday. ``However, we will 
vigorously defend our trademarks and our intellectual property 
rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, however, the Boston-based company, which dominates the  
men's shaving products market, got a taste of its own medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	It was reported over the weekend that Gillette was sued for  
patent infringement by Arthur D. Little Enterprises Inc. and the 
inventor of a device that indicates the wear on a disposable razor. 
</P>
<P>
	Inventor Siamak Doroodian-Shoja and Arthur Little, his licensee,  
claimed in U.S. District Court in Delaware that Gillette stole his 
design for the wear indicator on the company's three-bladed Mach3 
razor, which was launched in April 1998 with a $300 million 
promotional effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Kraus denied the company infringes on Doroodian-Shoja's patent,  
noting the Mach3 is protected by 35 Gillette patents. The company 
even built a wooden barrier around the plant where it was being 
developed.

<HEADLINE> Asian Markets Close Mostly Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed mostly lower  
Wednesday, led by sharp falls in Tokyo and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 252.05  
points, or 1.42 percent, to close at 17,529.74. It had gained 
172.21 points Tuesday, closing at the highest level in more than a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices began to fall in late trading after the government  
announced that total construction orders received by Japan's 50 
leading domestic contractors in May fell 11.3 percent from the same 
month last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This just highlights how bad the market interprets these  
figures,'' said Robert Sasaki, head of the quantitative strategy 
group at Jardine Fleming Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	On the currency market, the U.S. dollar fell against the  
Japanese yen after traders interpreted comments by Bank of Japan 
governor Masaru Hayami as a sign of an imminent interest rate hike. 
Higher interest rates increase the yield on yen-denominated assets, 
making the currency more attractive to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In late trading, the dollar bought 120.86 yen, down 0.40 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and below its late New York level of 
121.06 yen overnight 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors that China's reform-minded Premier Zhu Rongji is being  
asked to resign dragged down stocks in Hong Kong, mainland China 
and Jakarta. China has denied those rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, heavy selling in local futures markets and  
weakness in Tokyo's market hastened the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 1.7 percent, or 233.35  
points, to 13,532.14. It had fallen 0.5 percent Tuesday. All Hong 
Kong financial markets will be closed Thursday for a public 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, China's political uncertainties pushed the JSX  
Composite Index down 18.536 points, or 2.7 percent, to 662.025. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai stocks rose on better-than expected data on  
economic growth. The SET index gained 4.12 points, or 0.8 percent, 
to 521.77. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares plunged on expectations of a U.S.  
interest rate hike this week. The Composite index fell 18.62 
points, or 2.2 percent, to 811.10. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares rose slightly on a rally in gaming  
stocks. The PSE index rose 2.39 points, or 0.1 percent, to 
2,486.96. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: South Korean shares fell on news that Samsung Group will  
file for court receivership for debt-ridden unit Samsung Motors 
Inc. The Kospi fell 1.6 percent, or 14.45 points, to 883.00. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Shares fell after a recent rally, but investors  
remain optimistic. The Straits Times Index lost 13.38 points, or 
0.6 percent, to 2,167.70. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares fell as investors unloaded shares  
ahead of the end of the tax year. The All Ordinaries Index closed 
at 2,968.90, down 22.40 points, or 0.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Taiwan stocks fell after the rally on the previous  
session. The Weighted Price Index fell 46.90 points, or 0.55 
percent, to 8,467.37. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares fell slight, led by a 8.9-percent  
fall shares in Carter Holt Harvey Ltd. The NZSE-40 Capital Index 
fell 10.89, or 0.5 percent, to 2,136.4.

	Fed Hikes Interest Rates  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve raised a key interest rate  
by a tiny one-quarter point today, the first increase in two years. 
Fed policy-makers signaled the change may be enough to slow the 
economy to a more moderate pace. The Fed announced it was 
increasing its target for the federal funds rate, the interest that 
banks charge each other on overnight loans, to 5 percent, up from 
4.75 percent. The action had been widely expected. The Fed said 
given current tight labor market conditions, it ``must be 
especially alert to the emergence, or potential emergence, of 
inflationary forces that could undermine economic growth.'' Central 
bank policy-makers also said, however, that they were switching 
their policy directive, which serves as an indication of future 
moves, back to neutral.

	Dow Ends 155.45 Higher  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks soared today after the Federal Reserve  
followed through on a long-expected plan to raise interest rates. 
Investors were heartened by a suggestion from the Fed that a 
single, modest rate increase might be enough to quell inflation. 
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 155.45 to close at 
10,970.80. The index had fallen in the hours leading up to the 
Fed's announcement, dipping as much as 83.90 points below Tuesday's 
close. Broader stock indicators also reversed course and ended the 
session with solid gains. The Nasdaq composite index rose 44.30 to 
a new closing high of 2,686.41, eclipsing the previous high of 
2,652.05 set April 26. Bond prices, battered for weeks by the 
threat of inflation and higher interest rates, also recovered, 
sending yields on the 30-year Treasury bond falling to 5.99 percent 
from 6.06 percent late yesterday.

	Leading Indicators Rise Slightly  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A key gauge indicates the U.S. economy, already  
experiencing the longest peacetime growth in history, is on track 
to produce the longest expansion ever. The Index of Leading 
Economic Indicators rose 0.3 point in May, more than reversing a 
0.1 point decline in April and signaling the economy will keep 
growing into the new year, the Conference Board reported today. 
Michael Boldin, director of business cycle research at The 
Conference Board said, ``There is little evidence of cyclical 
imbalances that would jeopardize the economy's stability.'' The 
longest economic expansion in U.S. history lasted for 106 months, 
from February 1962 until December 1969. The current expansion would 
match the record if it continues through January 2000 and pass it 
if it lasts until February.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Frontier Corp., a small local and long-distance  
phone company, said it has agreed to meet with executives from 
Qwest to explore the company's $11.8 billion takeover offer. The 
statement opens the door to formal negotiations with Qwest that 
could jeopardize Frontier's existing $10.9 billion merger agreement 
with Global Crossing Ltd. But Frontier, which is based in 
Rochester, N.Y., said its decision to talk with Qwest ``in no way 
reflects a change in the Frontier Board's current approval and 
recommendation of the Global Crossing merger agreement.'' Qwest, 
however, took the announcement as a turning of the tide. Frontier 
shares were up 1/2 at 58 5/8; Qwest was up 3/16 at 33 1/6.

vehicle. More significantly, GM hopes to expand the Hummer line 
into the growing, high-profit market for big sport utility 
vehicles. Ron Zarrella, president of GM's North American

helping commodities firms illegally manipulate copper prices, the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced today. The big Wall 
Street firm said it also had agreed to pay about $10 million to 
settle related charges made by the London Metal Exchange in 
Britain. The CFTC charged in May that Merrill Lynch worked with 
Global Minerals and Metals Corp. and Japan's Sumitomo Corp. to 
artificially force prices higher in late 1995, fueling a scandal in 
the world copper market. In agreeing to the settlement, Merrill 
Lynch neither admitted to nor denied the allegations.

<HEADLINE> Garry Shandling Suit Set for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Garry Shandling is best known for comedy. But  
his $100 million lawsuit against his former manager is shaping up 
as a drama with implications that could stretch across Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, which was to begin today, pits Shandling, perhaps  
best known for the award-winning ``The Larry Sanders Show'' on HBO, 
against Brad Grey, who was executive producer of the now-defunct 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Shandling says that Grey had a conflict of interest by acting as  
his manager and the show's producer. The lawsuit alleges that Grey 
was able to ``triple-dip,'' taking excess commissions and fees out 
of the series. 
</P>
<P>
	It also claims Grey used Shandling's name to make $200  
million-plus in deals with ABC, MCA and Columbia Pictures and owes 
him a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The case could affect the growing number of personal managers  
who double as TV producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rory Rosegarten manages comedian Ray Romano and is an executive  
producer on his CBS sitcom ``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jenna Elfman is managed by Erwin More and Brian Medavoy, among  
the executive producers on her ABC series ``Dharma &AMP; Greg.'' 
Another client is Laura San Giacomo of ``Just Shoot Me,'' which 
also lists the two as executive producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Shandling's complaints, actors often lobby for such  
participation because of the belief their manager will be 
protective of them. 
</P>
<P>
	But the trend has caused fits in other quarters. It adds to a  
series' costs and can create tensions between producers who are 
more hands-on than managers who may carry the title but not the 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	A manager who gets a producing credit on a show can earn about  
$15,000 per episode, The Hollywood Reporter said. That's about 
$330,000 a season. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-decade relationship between Shandling and Grey, who  
collaborated on ``Larry Sanders'' (a behind-the-scenes look at a 
fictional talk show) and ``It's Garry Shandling's Show,'' ended 
when Grey resigned as Shandling's manager in late 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Grey's lawyer, Bert Fields has called the lawsuit filed in  
January 1998 ``sheer lunacy'' and ``nuts.'' He contends Shandling 
had nothing to do with building Grey's business outside of 
producing his own show. 
</P>
<P>
	But Walter Isaacson, Shandling's lawyer, said his client has the  
facts on his side. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that Mr. Shandling's case based on the conflicts of  
interest, breaches of trust and issues of fraud discussed in the 
complaint ... will make a persuasive case at trial,'' he said last 
week.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Reveals SEC Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission is  
investigating Microsoft Corp., apparently to review the way the 
company manages its revenue to smooth its financial results, chief 
financial officer Greg Maffei said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Maffei said in a telephone news conference that the  
investigation of the world's largest software maker apparently 
began several months ago and could continue for months ``or even 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our understanding is that it is related to reserves and  
reserve policies,'' Maffei said. ``The SEC has requested 
information from Microsoft and we are cooperating fully with the 
SEC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC probe -- under standard rules -- is under a tight cover of  
confidentiality, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maffei said the investigation apparently stemmed from an item in  
the Wall Street Journal on Jan. 14 about settlement of a 
wrongful-discharge lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court by Charles 
Pancerzewski, a former Microsoft internal auditor. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was settled for undisclosed terms and the record  
sealed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal reported that Pancerzewski had accused Microsoft of  
``cookie jar'' accounting, a practice in which revenue in strong 
quarters is set aside as reserves and reported in weaker periods to 
make earnings appear more stable. 
</P>
<P>
	A recorded message on a telephone line listed under  
Pancerzewski's name in Mukilteo said no one at that number was 
taking messages. Maffei would not comment on the case or the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, former Microsoft chief financial officer Mike Brown  
sent chairman Bill Gates an e-mail message that said in part, ``I 
believe we should do all we can to smooth our earnings and keep a 
steady-state earnings model,'' according to a court transcript 
cited by the Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street has generally responded favorably to Microsoft's  
tendency to understate its results. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked whether the SEC might find Microsoft's reporting had  
been overly conservative by design, Maffei replied, ``I don't know 
what their view would be. We are obviously a company that is known 
for conservatism, and I would be surprised if anyone who looked at 
our books would conclude otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday Maffei announced a series of revenue-neutral  
accounting changes and a longer amortization period for Windows, 
the personal computer operating software that is Microsoft's 
best-known product, that will boost earnings by a penny a share in 
the last quarter and a projected penny a share again during 
Microsoft's next fiscal year, which begins Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounting changes were made voluntarily to better reflect  
company operations, while the amortization change was required by 
an SEC regulatory change that was announced in December and is now 
taking effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounting changes will force the company to record money  
received for product support, consulting, certification and 
training of systems integrators and MSN online access as revenue, 
rather than as a reduction in expenses, Maffei said. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the changes involve reserves or have anything to do with  
the SEC probe, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maffei said he was ``very comfortable'' with analyst projections  
for the three months now ending, adding that those figures should 
be adjusted upward a penny a share and another cent for the next 12 
months because of the change.

five years, it's over. Our lives can begin again,'' Hubbell said

City bombing, ruling that incorrect guidelines were used to

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush, shattering presidential  
fund-raising records, raised $35.5 million in the first six months 
of 1999, nearly 10 times as much as his closest Republican rival 
and millions more than Vice President Al Gore. Bush's fund-raising 
prowess has virtually dried up the pool of GOP money for his 
rivals. The $35.5 million figure is also remarkable since the Texas 
governor did not actively start fund-raising until March. Gore, who 
only has one rival and has the power of the White House behind him, 
raised $17 million less than Bush.

Yugoslavia. Despite China's angry public denunciations since the 
attack nearly eight weeks ago, Sasser said he dined with President 
Jiang Zemin on Sunday, lunched Monday with Defense Minister Chi 
Haotian and had long talks with Premier Zhu Rongji at dinner 
Tuesday. The Chinese leaders used the unusually high-level send-off 
``to send a signal quietly that, when they can, they want to get 
this relationship back on track,'' Sasser, who leaves his post 
tomorrow, told Associated Press Television News.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Soar; Dow Ends Up 155.45 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks soared Wednesday, with some market  
indexes smashing through to record highs, as the Federal Reserve 
raised interest rates but hinted that a single, modest increase 
might be all that's needed to quell inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 155.45 to close at  
10,970.80, rounding out a session that saw the index drop as much 
as 83 points in morning trading, then pop over 11,000 for the first 
time since May 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's rally propelled broader market indicators to new  
closing highs. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 21.26 to 
1,372.71, beating its previous record of 1,367.56 reached May 13. 
The Nasdaq composite index rose 44.01 to close at 2,686.12, 
eclipsing the previous high of 2,652.05 set April 26. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market got a major relief rally,'' said John Shaughnessy,  
chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices, battered for weeks by the threat of inflation and  
higher interest rates, also recovered, sending yields on the 
30-year Treasury bond falling to 5.96 percent from 6.06 percent 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's Open Market Committee surprised few with the  
announcement of a quarter-percentage point increase in short-term 
interest rates. But the committee also returned to what's called a 
neutral bias on interest rates, which indicates Fed officials 
believe they may not need to follow up Wednesday's rate action with 
additional increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders welcomed the Fed's announcement, hoping for an end to  
the volatile price swings and sluggish trading that has 
characterized the market since mid-May, when the Fed first signaled 
its willingness to raise rates in an effort to hold inflation down. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank and brokerage stocks were among the first to benefit, as  
the Fed's future course appeared less punishing than previously 
feared. Shares of those companies are particularly vulnerable to 
higher interest rates, which cut into lending volume. 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan rose 4 3/4 to 140 1/2, the strongest gainer among Dow  
components. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter shot up 7 7/8 to 102 5/8, and 
Schwab gained 8 7/8 to close at 109. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts were quick to caution that the Fed's neutral bias  
leaves it plenty of room to impose higher rates if it finds further 
indications that inflation has crept into the still-booming 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did not close the door on further rate increases,'' said  
Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America, who 
expects the Fed to raise rates two to four more times -- each time 
by a quarter percentage point -- over the course of the next 12 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday marked the end of the second quarter and first half,  
and some money managers shifted their portfolios up to the last 
minute, hoping to settle positions left in limbo while investors 
awaited the Fed's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	David G. Sowerby, a vice president at Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co., said  
the sluggishness of the past few weeks should be easy to forget in 
light of the market's vibrant performance in the first half. The 
Dow has gained 19.5 percent in the year to date. The Nasdaq, which 
is dominated by technology stocks, gained 22.5 percent in the first 
half, and the S&AMP;P 500 gained 11.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sowerby noted that a wide range of stocks in the S&AMP;P 500 rose  
over the course of the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a broader, deeper leadership,'' he said. ``Many  
people will be pleasantly surprised when they look at their 401(k)s 
or mutual fund statements from this quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the overall market continued its rally Wednesday, some  
stocks were left on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of long-distance phone companies were mostly lower. MCI  
WorldCom faltered, slipping 7 9/16 to 86 1/16, amid reports of a 
Justice Department antitrust investigation of its undersea cable 
business. Also, one Wall Street analyst predicted an industry price 
war as the companies struggle for competitive position. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney was lower for much of the session after Merrill Lynch  
analyst Jessica Reif Cohen forecast lower earnings for fiscal years 
1999 and 2000. The ebullience of the afternoon session lifted 
Disney shares, however, to close at 30 13/16, up 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. NYSE composite volume totaled a robust 
1.33 billion shares, compared to 964.00 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> New Hampshire May Move Up Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- New Hampshire, the traditional  
first-in-the-nation presidential primary state, could hold its 
primary this year under a bill signed by Gov. Jeanne Shaheen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're committed to making sure we remain a week before any  
other state,'' Shaheen said on signing the bill late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, which took effect immediately, is aimed at giving the  
state more flexibility in setting its primary date and deterring 
other states from usurping New Hampshire's role. 
</P>
<P>
	``This law sends a message loud and clear that New Hampshire  
will do what it takes to preserve its first-in-the-nation status,'' 
Shaheen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary schedule is stacked with early, important tests as  
more and more states vie to influence the outcome of the 
presidential race by setting their primaries earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire's old law required the primary to be at least one  
week before any other state's, but specified it had to be held in a 
presidential election year. The new law would allow the primary to 
be held the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire's primary typically is in mid-February, eight days  
after the Iowa caucuses, which are tentatively set for Feb. 7. 
However, Secretary of State William Gardner is waiting to see what 
other states do before setting the date. He has said the latest it 
will be held is Feb. 8 because South Carolina wants to hold its 
primary Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington state has chosen Feb. 29 and Delaware is pushing for  
Feb. 12, or whichever Saturday follows the New Hampshire primary, 
which is always on a Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law moves up the filing period for candidates from  
December to November and asks presidential candidates not to 
participate in any similar election scheduled within seven days of 
New Hampshire's.

<HEADLINE> Study: Heart Defect Not As Dangerous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Graphic planned    	
</P>
<P>
	The millions of Americans who have been told they have a  
serious, sometimes fatal heart defect called mitral valve prolapse 
probably have nothing to fear, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	The condition, long considered a ``hidden epidemic'' afflicting  
5 percent to 30 percent of Americans, is far less dangerous -- and 
less common -- than doctors believed, two studies show. 
</P>
<P>
	``That really is a sea change,'' said Dr. Marc Klapholz,  
director of the heart failure program at University Hospital in 
Newark, N.J. ``It's extremely good news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The research is reported in Thursday's New England Journal of  
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have routinely warned patients that the condition, while  
often symptomless, may require surgery to prevent complications 
that can cause sudden death. Among those complications: stroke, 
heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms that cause fainting. 
</P>
<P>
	But researchers determined that the patients who actually had  
mitral valve prolapse suffered those complications at about the 
same rate, just 6 percent, as a healthy comparison group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't assume that it's a sort of death sentence,'' concluded  
Dr. Emelia J. Benjamin, a professor of medicine at Boston 
University who led one of the studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Her advice: Talk to your doctor about a re-test, particularly if  
you were diagnosed years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers also found that prolapse strikes men and women  
equally, contradicting medical lore that it was especially common 
in women under 45. 
</P>
<P>
	The mitral valve lets oxygenated blood into the heart's main  
pumping chamber. In prolapse, for reasons still unclear, the 
valve's two flaps become elongated and floppy, and some blood leaks 
backward when the chamber contracts to pump out blood. Major 
leakage can cause serious problems, but those are rare. 
</P>
<P>
	The diagnosis has unnecessarily frightened healthy patients,  
barred them from jobs such as flying airplanes and increased health 
insurance premiums for many, noted Dr. Robert A. Levine, a 
professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
	Early research found suspiciously high numbers of people had  
mitral valve prolapse. Why? Cardiologists had no standard criteria 
for how much deviation in valve position and thickness constituted 
prolapse, they wrongly believed normal valves were shaped like 
saucers, and their research subjects generally were people with 
symptoms that drove them to major hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Levine and colleagues eventually determined the valves are  
shaped like saddles and established specific criteria for 
diagnosing prolapse from cardiac ultrasounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Using those criteria, Benjamin's team re-examined ultrasounds  
from 3,491 men and women participating in the Framingham Heart 
Study, a long-running study of volunteers from a Boston suburb. 
Benjamin found only 2.4 percent, or 84 people, had the condition; 
just five had serious complications. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Levine found only 2 percent of 213 stroke patients  
under 45 that he examined had prolapse, vs. 40 percent in early 
studies. Levine's rate was about the same as in a stroke-free 
comparison group. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers now must discover which of the 5 million-plus  
Americans with prolapse will develop dangerous complications.

<HEADLINE> Volunteer Rifle Squad Pays Respects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- John Matschi played ``Taps'' slow and steady  
through his trumpet, as he does every Tuesday, near the shade of an 
oak tree at Fort Snelling National Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't know the Navy veteran he played for, or the man's  
family, or even when the man had served. But that mattered little 
to Matschi and the dozen other veterans in black and white who 
provided military honors at the burial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're dedicated, and we take care of other veterans,'' said  
Matschi, 83, who was an Army infantryman, first in France during 
World War II and again later in the Korean War. ``I guess there's a 
sense of satisfaction, that we are doing something for our 
comrades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matschi played his horn after seven riflemen fired a 21-gun  
salute over flag bearers carrying American, Navy and U.S. Veterans 
Administration colors. Two white-gloved men followed the salute 
with 12 crisp folds of a U.S. flag that was presented to the 
veteran's survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a ritual performed increasingly often by the volunteer Fort  
Snelling Memorial Rifle Squad -- nearly 20 times on some days -- as 
aging World War II veterans die. The 117-member squad -- broken into 
five units, one for each day of the week -- has attended more than 
30,500 burials since it was formed 20 years ago, on June 19, 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are times when -- it seems more often these days -- when a  
friend of mine is gone, and I'll ask for permission to present the 
flag,'' Matschi said. ``It's not an easy thing to do, but I will do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Fort Snelling had more than 4,000 burials, including  
veterans and their spouses and dependents. That's about 1,000 more 
annual burials than a decade earlier, according to Steve Muro, the 
cemetery director. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, the U.S. Veterans Administration reports that about  
377,000 World War II veterans died in 1998. And of the 53,380 
military veterans buried in national cemeteries last year, 63 
percent had served in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-four years after the war ended, only 5.9 million Americans  
out of 16.5 million who served in it are living, and they are dying 
at a rate of about 1,000 per day. 
</P>
<P>
	Lunching on tuna sandwiches and chips in the rifle squad's  
headquarters near the cemetery's entrance, the men -- and a lone 
woman -- who make up the Tuesday unit joked about their advancing 
age (the average is 74), their skills on the resident cribbage 
board and whom to blame for forgetting to bring doughnuts that 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	They rarely share war stories -- those days are gone. But they  
acknowledge that the growing loss of a national resource -- the men 
and women shaped by the century's defining conflict -- worries them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ancient history as far as the younger generation is  
concerned,'' said Joe Conley, 68, a schoolboy during World War II 
who served in Korea as a gunner on a B-29 bomber plane. ``They 
don't see any rhyme or reason to it, maybe the way I looked at the 
Civil War when I was a kid, or the Spanish-American War.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These veterans agree that young people need to know at least one  
thing: that the world would be a vastly inferior place had the 
totalitarians of this century prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wouldn't have the freedoms that we have today, especially  
if World War II had gone another way,'' said Conley, who drives the 
rifle squad to burial sites throughout the cemetery in an 18-seat 
bus donated by a local VFW. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, they don't always agree. Some say that Vietnam was a  
travesty, others that Korea was avoidable. But they all say the 
conflict with fascist aggression was inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	Said 71-year-old Hugh Heckel: ``We have to do what needs to be  
done to keep our country the way it should be. And I think we have 
a moral right to do it -- to preserve our values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heckel served in the Army's 82nd Airborne in Italy after World  
War II, when the country was occupied by Allied forces. Three of 
his brothers survived the war and are now buried at Fort Snelling, 
and Heckel thinks their sacrifices ought not to be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been so damned disgusted as when I saw some kids  
from California on the TV news, and they were asked about Pearl 
Harbor. They didn't know what it was,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in Washington are trying not to forget.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the next two years, five cemeteries are to be added to the  
115 national cemeteries in existence, said Paul Sherbo, a VA 
spokesman based in Denver. Earlier this year, Congress began debate 
on a bill to set aside money to ensure that all veterans who 
request it will get military honors at their burial. 
</P>
<P>
	For their part, the Fort Snelling volunteers say they will keep  
showing up, five days a week, without complaint. They're furnished 
with nothing more than a white shirt and utility belt, black 
trousers and a bag lunch prepared by the VA. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Flynn, 81, and Albert Lavansky, 82 -- two of the oldest  
members of the squad -- sat on the bus and rested their legs while 
the others lined up for the next burial service. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynn served in France and the Philippines during World War II  
while Lavansky was sent to Guam. 
</P>
<P>
	The men easily remembered the dates they were drafted -- April  
16, 1943, and Sept. 17, 1941, respectively -- and then sat silently, 
peering out the window, past the clean rows of white headstones 
running into the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm lucky to be here,'' said Flynn, recalling that he was  
steeling himself for a land invasion in the Pacific theater when 
the atom bomb ended the war. ``I have Harry Truman to thank. 
Otherwise, I would probably be under one of those white crosses, in 
a green field somewhere in the South Pacific.''

<HEADLINE> Serial Killer Ng Faces Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Charles Ng, who spent 14 years battling  
prosecutors only to be convicted of murdering 11 people, has run 
out of reasons not to be sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng faced a sentence of death or life in prison without parole at  
a hearing scheduled today in Orange County Superior Court. A jury 
has recommended the death penalty for the sex-and-torture killing 
spree in Calaveras County in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng, 38, was the subject of one of the longest and costliest  
homicide prosecutions in California history. The final cost to 
taxpayers was estimated at $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong immigrant and former U.S. Marine was convicted of  
murdering six men, three women and two baby boys in 1984 and 1985. 
Prosecutors said the women were imprisoned, tortured and raped 
after being lured to a cabin belonging to Ng's friend, Leonard 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Charred human remains and the victims' belongings were found at  
the cabin in the Sierra Nevada foothills 150 miles east of San 
Francisco. Lake, a survivalist, lived there and had built a bunker 
with a prisoner's cell. He killed himself after a shoplifting 
arrest in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng was arrested later that year in Canada, where he fought  
extradition for five years. The trial was transferred to Southern 
California because of pretrial publicity, and the case dragged on 
as Ng hired and fired attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng denied he killed anyone, and said he didn't know Lake planned  
to kill either. But jurors watched graphic videotapes in which Lake 
and Ng were seen tormenting bound women. 
</P>
<P>
	In the penalty phase, Ng's parents flew in from Hong Kong and  
testified that he had been abused as a child. Several people also 
testified about Ng's good character, including former Marines, 
prison guards and a prisoner who said Ng helped him find religion.

<HEADLINE> Everbearing Strawberries Praised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- I've been served strawberries as large  
as golf balls -- and to me about as tasteless. Give me the smallest, 
the alpine, for deliciousness and, in my garden, for ease of 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Why some growers, and, obviously, some customers, fancy  
ever-larger strawberries is a mystery to me. I cannot fathom the 
appeal of bigness, as such, in fruit, and that goes for tomatoes, 
too. Flavor tends to decrease as size increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyway, I used to buy the small, everbearing strawberry  
varieties as potted plants from nurseries to edge borders. The 
fruit, also known as ``fraise de bois,'' was delicious but 
relatively sparse, and the plants were expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Then I decided to grow them from seed and transplant them to a  
raised bed. This project has truly prospered, giving me fruit from 
spring to fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The versatility of a home garden depends, of course, on its size  
and on how many people it's supposed to serve. For a widower, like 
me, or for a couple, a large variety of things may be grown in a 
relatively small space that would be impractical for a family of 
four or more. That goes for my alpine strawberries. 
</P>
<P>
	With railroad ties, I built a raised bed enclosure 4 feet long  
by 2 1/2 feet wide and 6 inches deep and filled it with bags of 
topsoil. From a seedhouse, I bought a variety of everbearing 
strawberries called Italian Alpine and started the seed indoors 
under lights. 
</P>
<P>
	The seed took several months to produce tiny plants. I put 24 of  
them in the raised bed in early spring and they slowly grew in 
size, producing my first fruit in midsummer. By the second year, 
the first fruit appeared in midspring and kept yielding until late 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, these are not huge yields. One picking will give me 30 or  
40 berries, good for a dessert or two, and the next picking may not 
be ready for another week or so. Thieving birds get their share, 
too. But I don't want strawberries more often than that. I also 
grow raspberries and figs. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the fact that they're everbearing, another big plus  
with alpine strawberries is that there are no so-called runners to 
root, unlike the more conventionally-grown strawberries that throw 
out long runners to form new plants. The alpines stay in place and 
may be divided every two or three years to form new plants, if 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Not having to tend to runners saves a lot of work. It also makes  
alpines ideal to grow in baskets, tubs or strawberry barrels with 
holes in the side through which the plants are inserted and their 
roots spread. The appeal of such containers is that they can be 
moved around to maximize exposure to sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the Italian Alpine that I grow, other popular  
everbearing berries include Baron Solemacher, Ruegen Improved and 
Mignonette. There are white ones as well as red. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberries, and the everbearing in particular, need plenty of  
water, especially when they're producing. 
</P>
<P>
	You can save moisture by mulching, but it's wise every now and  
then to dig down at least six inches to test the soil for dryness. 
</P>
<P>
	The best soil for strawberries is a rich loam which is not too  
alkaline. The pH factor should be between 5 and 6. A balanced 
fertilizer, like 5-10-5, applied in spring and fall will help 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	The small berries recall the wild strawberries that were known  
from ancient times in Europe and are still highly prized there when 
picked in season in the woodlands. Their aroma is wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
	Native strawberries were also abundant in the Americas. A  
Maryland colonist wrote, ``We cannot set down a foot but tread on 
strawberries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Breeding experiments, especially involving a Chilean variety in  
the 18th century, led to larger and what some people think of as 
better strawberries. But some of us remain addicted to the small.
