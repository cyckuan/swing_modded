DYNASTY NOT TO BE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ D.C. United coach Bruce Arena called his
latest collection of talent possibly the best in his three seasons
as leader of Major League Soccer's class team.
</P>
<P>
   But on a day when the league's glamour squad couldn't turn its
dominating three years into the dynasty everyone said it would,
there was nothing to blame but destiny.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Fire's stunning 2-0 victory against United in MLS
Cup '98 on Sunday at the Rose Bowl before 51,350 fans couldn't have
been explained any differently.
</P>
<P>
   And because of that, Arena and his players hardly trumpeted the
bitterness card.
</P>
<P>
   Even when it appeared they might take the route toward assessing
blame elsewhere, they quickly caught themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was the missed call on (Marco) Etcheverry early on and
the offsides they didn't call on the second goal was a big play,''
Arena said, pausing for a moment. ``But you know, you don't want to
take anything away. This was Chicago's day.''
</P>
<P>
   So what was it exactly that went wrong for this United team that
had outscored Chicago 7-2 in two meetings this season and had been
shutout only one other time in '98?
</P>
<P>
   The answers are seemingly endless, but one angle that continued
to rear itself in the final analysis had to do with D.C.
squandering opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   And there were plenty of those to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   From Jaime Moreno's blast over the net from 10 yards away 14
seconds in, to Etcheverry's countless setups from the midfield, all
sandwiched between at least five Roy Lassiter on-target headers,
D.C. can't say it was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we played very well today, I really did,'' said
Arena, who is expected to be the next U.S. National Team coach. ``I
didn't like the way some things went, but maybe it doesn't make a
difference anyway. The Fire played well and they are champions.''
</P>
<P>
   When United's plan of wanting to capture early momentum with the
game's first goal fizzled, it left the Fire's back wall all the
tougher to crack once its offense finally score.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a certain frustration level for D.C., never more
evident than early in the second half when Lassiter's point-blank
header was deflected away by goalkeeper Zach Thornton for a corner
kick.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking he should have put that chance away, Lassiter grabbed
the dead ball and fired it into the side of the net. Since Lassiter
failed to convert the most opportunities of any D.C. player, it
might have been the reason he left the locker room before reporters
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Etcheverry, the center of United's playmaking, didn't seem to
establish himself fully, thanks to the marking of Chicago's Chris
Armas, although the Bolivian did have his chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armas was with me at every moment,'' said Etcheverry, who was
pulled down in the penalty area in the fourth minute by Lubos
Kubik, although no foul was called. ``We just couldn't convert.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as it would have helped D.C. to catch a break on a
scoring chance or a referee's decision, midfielder John Harkes was
one who wouldn't hear of excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can talk about that stuff until you're blue in the face,
but that's how soccer is,'' Harkes said. ``Sometimes the referees
catch things and sometimes they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes dynasties crumble before ever getting off the
ground.

MLS CUP NOTEBOOK

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Although most of D.C. United's players
handled Sunday's defeat in MLS Cup '98 with class, one apparently
chose to show otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Chicago's Jerzy Podbrozny -- who scored the
winning goal -- was whacked in the throat by a flying forearm just
as the final whistle sounded.
</P>
<P>
   As teammates celebrated the victory, the former Polish National
Team star was attended to by trainers after being felled by the
blow near midfield.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit?
</P>
<P>
   ``The tall, dark one,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Which tall, dark one?
</P>
<P>
   ``El Papa, el (United defender Eddie) Pope,'' Podbrozny said.
``He did out out of frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Pope discounted any contact at game's conclusion as
simply occurring during the flow of play.
</P>
<P>
   United defender Jeff Agoos, a national team veteran, is looking
forward to some much-needed time off, unable to remember the last
time he had any.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want to think about soccer for a while,'' said
Agoos, who planned a trip to New York for some enjoyment. ``I'll
just go there and have some fun for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Agoos was nearby late in the first half when a shot by Chicago's
Peter Nowak deflected off teammate Diego Gutierrez for a fluke goal
and 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a typical MLS goal,'' Agoos said, drawing laughs from
the small group of reporters around him. ``It was like pinball.
Maybe it was a hand ball, maybe it was offsides. But those are the
breaks and if you don't get them, you don't win.''
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United coach Bruce Arena, the frontrunner for the vacant
U.S. National Team coaching position, is rumored to be flying for
New York, where the announcment will me made official on Tuesday.

   The New York Times' computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is very little
difference between UCLA (1) and Ohio State (2), with a somehat
larger difference between Ohio State (2) and Tennessee (3).
</P>
<P>
   (x) The cumulative records and margin average of vistory of each
team's opponents do not include games against the ranked team.

LEGACE HOLDS ON

 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ After Sunday morning's practice, Los Angeles
Kings coach Larry Robinson gathered his players at center ice in
the empty Greensboro Coliseum to deliver a concise message. His
words were simple, his voice clear, his manner a mixture of anger
and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot the (bleeping) puck,'' Robinson yelled. ``Hit the
(bleeping) net!''
</P>
<P>
   His players not only listened but heard.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille and Glen Murray scored second-period goals, Sandy
Moger added the game-winner on a deflection late in the third
period, and Manny Legace made 29 saves as the Kings beat the
Carolina Hurricanes 3-2 Sunday afternoon before an announced crowd
of 5,569.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the goals aren't coming easy now,'' Murray said.
``We've just got to shoot it, plain and simple. We've just got to
keep shooting and playing hard, and hopefully some will start going
in.''
</P>
<P>
   There was much for the Kings (3-2-2) to savor in the victory.
They got stronger as the game progressed, made smart decisions
defensively and displayed a tenacity largely absent the first six
games.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the first period, when the Kings took only four shots _
three of them shorthanded and just one at even strength _ they
seemed in control against the fatigued Hurricanes. Carolina, which
had been unbeaten in its previous four games, had won in Ottawa
less than 24 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team was a little bit weary,'' Hurricanes coach Paul
Maurice said, ``and we were playing the biggest team in the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning goal exemplified the increased intensity in the
Kings' play.
</P>
<P>
   Linemates Steve McKenna, Nathan Lafayette and Moger outmuscled
the Hurricanes for the puck behind the Carolina net. The puck
eventually landed on the stick of defenseman Mattias Norstrom at
the left point. Norstrom shot and Moger deflected the puck past
goalie Trevor Kidd, who was screened, giving the Kings the
game-winning goal with 2:54 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a big team,'' the 6-foot-3, 220-pound Moger said. ``We
can't be too fancy. We have to get it deep and cycle the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said, ``When we're on our game, we've got guys coming
out with cuts over their eyes and bumps on their head and ice
packs, because that means we're involved. We can't play on the
perimeter and expect to have any success.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes (2-2-3) took a 1-0 lead 8:06 into the second
period when Keith Primeau broke free from Philippe Boucher behind
the Kings' net and centered the puck to an unchecked Robert Kron,
whose quick shot eluded Legace.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Kings _ who are 1-1-1 on their five-game trip _ just
1:16 to get even. Defenseman Curtis Leschyshyn coughed up the puck
to Ray Ferraro, who passed it to Robitaille, who wound up and fired
to beat Kidd between the pads from 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw (Leschyshyn) behind the net and he didn't seem too
aware,'' Robitaille said. ``I hooked him a little and he panicked.
Ray took it away, got it back to me and I shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than four minutes later, Murray put the Kings in front when
he carried the puck into the Carolina zone and _ instead of looking
to make a pass _ fired a 50-footer over Kidd's glove.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Roberts tied the score early in the third period, beating
Legace on a rebound, but the Kings maintained their composure and
eventually scored the game-winner. The Kings also killed two
third-period penalties, and have killed all but one of 39
short-handed situations this season. They have killed 27
consecutive penalties and have not allowed a goal in the last 48
minutes, 58 seconds they've been a man short.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys are doing a great job,'' said defenseman Doug Bodger,
who appeared in his 1,000th NHL game. ``It's not just defensemen or
forwards. It's all four guys. Everybody is contributing and we're
getting big saves.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Legace, who was the Hurricanes' eighth-round
draft choice in 1993, when they were based in Hartford. Legace, 25,
never got to appear in a game with Hartford or Carolina, which
traded him this summer to the Kings for a 1999 conditional draft
choice. Legace's victory Sunday was his first in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to get my first win against a team I was with and
got traded from,'' he said.``It's funny how it happened that way.
It was a little extra incentive.''
</P>

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
We interrupt a season of upsets, wild finishes and delicious
turbulence _ all in all, a lively first two months of college
football _ to bring you this important update from Birmingham,
Ala.:
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first Bowl Championship Series ratings will be released
today. As a result, only two of the leading contenders for the
national championship are likely to be very happy about the current
drift of things as the race for the Fiesta Bowl and the designated
national-title game finds a new gear.
</P>
<P>
   Being No. 1 will be great. Sliding in at No. 2 isn't bad,
either, since it's still good for a spot in The Big One.
</P>
<P>
   No. 3? That means you're still looking for the access road to
Tempe, which isn't so great at all.
</P>
<P>
   After a weekend that produced little new in the upper echelon _
Ohio State, UCLA, Tennessee and Kansas State were all easy winners
_ the challenge of squeezing four or more into the two spots
available for the Jan. 4 showdown for all the (tortilla) chips
remains sticky business.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes retained the top spot in both the Associated Press
media poll and the USA Today/ESPN coaches poll. UCLA is second in
both, but Tennessee is third among the media and fourth with the
coaches, while Kansas State is fourth with the AP and third in USA
Today/ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   All are unbeaten, though all with some work left to do. Each can
make a legitimate claim on a spot in the season's final night and
will be happy to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But four into two won't go, obviously, which is where the BCS _
brainchild of Southeastern Conference commissioner Roy Kramer _
comes into play.
</P>
<P>
   The four-part rating system that makes its debut this season
combines the results of the two major polls _ the AP and USA
Today/ESPN _ to account for one-fourth of a total value. This week,
for instance, Ohio State would be assigned a 1.0 in that category,
while UCLA would get a 2.0. Tennessee and Kansas State, in turn,
would each receive 3.5s.
</P>
<P>
   Computer rankings compiled by Jeff Sagarin, the Seattle Times
and New York Times compose another quarter of the formula. Strength
of schedule (with opponents' opponents factored in as well)
provides a third element in the equation, while record (in effect,
losses) makes up the fourth, with each defeat counting as one
point.
</P>
<P>
   The school with the lowest overall total is No. 1, the
next-lowest No. 2, etc. The winners of the Atlantic Coast
Conference, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, Pacific-10 and SEC
automatically qualify for placement in the Bowl Championship Series
(which also includes the Rose, Orange and Sugar bowls, each of
which will host the title game on a rotating basis). The other two
spots will go to at-large entries.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, of course, is to reward the two most worthy teams with
spots in the national-title game and produce a legitimate champion,
a concept that often eluded the traditional bowl system. (Nebraska
and Michigan, for instance, were prevented from meeting a year ago
by pre-existing bowl ties.)
</P>
<P>
   All of this has been fine in theory, but the reality is that yet
another tradition _ someone feeling unjustly left out and becoming
a tad vocal about it _ is about to rear its ugly head, too.
</P>
<P>
   Sagarin's ratings, for instance, put UCLA No. 1 after Saturday's
games, elevate Kansas State to No. 2 and drop Ohio State all the
way to third. So while the writers and coaches may agree on the
title-game matchup, the well-regarded MIT grad from Bloomington,
Ind., does not, and his voice will be considered, too.
</P>
<P>
   The manner in which the BCS formula is weighted, in fact,
severely dilutes the more traditional polls while giving greater
emphasis to power ratings and schedule strength. In that light,
Ohio State's weekend rout of Northwestern actually may have cost
the Buckeyes ground, and they may not have a chance to gain it back
with only one ranked team (No. 22 Michigan) left on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, meanwhile, benefited from weekend wins by Oregon, Arizona
and Texas (the last of those unranked by the writers and coaches
but No. 14 in the Sagarin poll). Miami's victory over previous No.
13 West Virginia helped the folks in Westwood, too, since UCLA will
play the Hurricanes on Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   With the Big Four unbeatens at the top and Wisconsin (No. 9 in
the AP, No. 8 with the coaches) in good position to run the table,
teams already saddled with a loss will need help to get back into
the title picture. Even so, both Florida State (No. 5 in the AP and
No. 6 with the coaches, coming off a Saturday rout of then-No. 20
Georgia Tech) and Florida (which reverses the positions) are
hanging around, and the Gators can further help themselves against
No. 11 Georgia this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Twice-beaten Michigan could be a spoiler, with games at Ohio
State and against Wisconsin still to play. UCLA must survive its
annual death match with USC, plus the rescheduled meeting with
on-the-rise Miami. Tennessee has the rest of its SEC schedule, plus
a conference-championship game, while Kansas State has Nebraska at
home and a Big 12 title game with the South survivor serving as
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Should Wisconsin (which doesn't play Ohio State this year) go
11-0 and not make the top two _ both definite possibilities _ the
Badgers might console themselves with a Rose Bowl trip and a
meeting with Notre Dame. The Irish could sneak into one of the
at-large spots by winning only three of their last five games.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, the BCS begins the process of sorting
out who will play in what it hopes will be a settle-it-on-the-field
title showdown in the desert. At the very least, Kramer's scheme
will make a good first impression with two schools that will think
the whole thing is a pretty good idea.
</P>
<P>
   The others may reserve their applause until after they see the
only BCS poll that really counts _ the one that comes out at the
end of the season, when the Final Two for Tempe at last get the
call.

DENVER _ In their mission to repeat as Super Bowl champions, the
Denver Broncos have become so lethal they should come with a
warning. If they were any more dangerous, the NFL should launch an
investigation.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jacksonville may want to file a police report after the way the
Jaguars were mugged Sunday at Mile High Stadium. In a game that
featured the two best teams in the AFC, the Jaguars showed heart
and guts but ultimately became just another victim for the Broncos,
whose arsenal included an NFL-record-tying 63-yard field goal by
Jason Elam.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's 37-24 victory wasn't as close as the score indicated.
The Broncos, who are 7-0 for the first time in the 39-year history
of the franchise, led by 17 points in the fourth quarter and never
allowed the Jaguars within 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a playoff game for us,'' said Denver running back
Terrell Davis, who rushed for 136 yards and three touchdowns. ``I
wanted a game like this against one of the league's best teams to
see where we stood. Now, I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how good are the Broncos? They have won 12 consecutive
games. They average 34.2 points a game. They have trailed for only
4 minutes, 23 seconds in seven games. They have the second-longest
season-opening winning streak of any defending Super Bowl champion,
trailing only the 1990 San Francisco 49ers, who started 10-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos generated 465 yards and showed the kind of balance
few teams ever have. Davis, the NFL's leading rusher and scorer,
also had five catches for a career-high 76 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also joined Jim Brown and O.J. Simpson as the only backs
in NFL history to reach 1,000 yards rushing in the first seven
games of a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a heck of a compliment for Terrell because we all know
how great those two players were,'' Broncos coach Mike Shanahan
said. ``Terrell's very early in his career, so he'll be measured by
what he does over the course of his career. But he's sure off to a
great start.''
</P>
<P>
   Broncos quarterback John Elway completed 21 of 35 passes for 295
yards, including a 41-yard touchdown pass to Ed McCaffrey. Elway
wasn't sacked or intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   Elam kicked field goals of 31, 63 and 32 yards. His 63-yarder as
time expired in the first half tied Tom Dempsey's NFL record, which
has stood since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's defense surrendered 348 yards, but most came after the
Broncos built a comfortable lead and played soft zone coverage to
prevent big plays. The Jaguars had only 97 yards in the first half
and trailed 27-10 at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they would have tried to run more to keep our
offense off the field,'' Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski said.
``It seemed like the longest game in history because of all the
passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense put a lot of pressure on (Jaguars quarterback
Mark) Brunell. We broke his rhythm. You could tell he wasn't sure
what he wanted to do a few times when he came to the line of
scrimmage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars, who lost their second consecutive game to fall to
5-2, rushed for only 66 yards. Brunell completed 28 of 46 passes
for 353 yards and three touchdowns to running back Fred Taylor
(four yards), tight end Damon Jones (31) and tight end Pete
Mitchell (two).
</P>
<P>
   Brunell wasn't intercepted, but he was sacked seven times, twice
by tackle Trevor Pryce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time there's no run involved, it's easy to tee off on the
quarterback,'' Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin said. ``I wasn't
disappointed in our second-half effort _ I was disappointed about
everything in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denver's an exceptional team. Certainly, we're not playing at
their level yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The only team in the league that might be playing at Denver's
level is Minnesota. But the Broncos have played a tougher schedule.
Jacksonville was the fifth team with a winning record the Broncos
have defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense hasn't played a perfect game yet,'' Elway said.
``We killed ourselves in scoring position today and had a lot of
penalties (eight).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got nine games to go, but this game could be very
important down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Broncos and Jaguars exchanged first-period field
goals, Denver took a lead it never surrendered when Elway found
McCaffrey cutting across the middle on the 41-yard touchdown. After
Jacksonville fumbled a snap at the Jaguars' nine, Davis scored on a
four-yard run for a 17-3 advantage early in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Brunell's short pass to Taylor produced Jacksonville's first
touchdown, but Davis responded with a one-yard run to make it
24-10. Elam's 63-yard field goal gave Denver a 17-point lead at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first half was horrible offensively and defensively,''
Brunell said. ``We fought back, but it's still very discouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunell's 31-yard touchdown pass to Jones pulled Jacksonville
within 27-17 with 5:25 left in the third quarter, but the Jaguars'
defense couldn't stop the Broncos or force a turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' 37-yard touchdown run boosted the lead to 34-17 early in
the fourth quarter. After Brunell threw his third touchdown pass to
make it 34-24, Elam finished Denver's scoring with his last field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fortunate to stop them on their last drive,'' Shanahan
said. ``We were fighting for our lives. If they had scored a
touchdown and gotten an onside kick, we could have lost the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't.

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
DENVER _ When Denver kicker Jason Elam lined up for a 63-yard field
goal at the end of Sunday's first half between the Broncos and
Jacksonville Jaguars, he knew he would make NFL history if his kick
was good.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former New Orleans Saints kicker Tom Dempsey, who had owned the
record since Nov. 8, 1970, was watching the Broncos' game against
Jacksonville on television at his home in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The snap by David Diaz-Infante and the hold by Tom Rouen were
perfect, and Elam's kick sailed through the Mile High Stadium
altitude as if it were traveling in slow motion. When the ball
split the uprights with room to spare, Elam was mobbed by his
teammates as they celebrated his record-tying boot.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the ball was spotted on the field, I knew it would tie
Dempsey's record if I made it,'' Elam said after the Broncos' 37-24
victory. ``Those goal posts sure look skinny from way back there. I
only looked up once, because a kick from that distance can be very
intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I kicked it, I knew it was going to be close. I lost it
in the lights for a moment. I tried to help it along by waving my
arms, and I almost beat the ball down the field. When it went
through, I started jumping up and down. I don't remember anything
about halftime or the early part of the third quarter, but it makes
me very proud. It was a very special moment for me, one that I'll
remember for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey, who also kicked for the Houston Oilers near the end of
his career, set the record against Detroit. Born with a clubbed
right foot, Dempsey kicked with a special shoe, and his record kick
brought some protests that he had an illegal advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching (Elam's kick), and I gave a big cheer when it
went through,'' Dempsey said. ``It was a great kick and a great
effort. You have to admire it. I hope he's just as proud of it as I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey was surprised it took so long for someone to equal his
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``As good as people are getting now, I knew it was just a matter
of time,'' he said. ``People are kicking them longer and longer.''
</P>
<P>
   There are only two situations in which a coach would give a
kicker a chance at that distance _ the end of the first half and
the end of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos actually got a delay penalty that moved them back
five yards to the Jacksonville 45. Coach Mike Shanahan called for
the punt team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Jason if he could make it, and he said yes,'' Shanahan
said. ``We weren't surprised, because we've seen him kick them that
distance in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan joked that he ordered the penalty to give Elam a chance
to tie the record because ``58 yards would have been just another
field goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The kick shattered Elam's personal high of 56 yards. He made
that distance in high school and college and with the Broncos. In
1995, Elam missed a 66-yard attempt at the end of a first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three-fourths of the kickers in this league have the ability
to make a field goal at that distance,'' Elam said. ``It's a matter
of getting an opportunity. At halftime, I thanked him (Shanahan)
for giving me that opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   There are times at practice when Shanahan will have Elam attempt
63-yard field goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stands behind me and yells when I'm kicking,'' Elam said.
``That ball might have gone a little farther if he had been behind
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Elam knows many will say the altitude aided him, but that
doesn't diminish his rendezvous with history.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still have to kick the ball,'' he said. ``I think altitude
helps early in the season, but by this time, the field gets nasty
and messy, and clumps of grass come up. Guys were slipping all
over, and I'm glad I put on longer cleats.''

LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF HOSPITALIZED AFTER FALL AT HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LEE CONDON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A week before facing the toughest election of his
career in which his failing health has been a major campaign issue,
Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block was in the hospital Sunday
after hitting his head at his home in the suburban Los Angeles
community of West Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Block, 74, fell in the shower Saturday and received 10 stitches
on the back of the head. On Sunday, he remained in stable condition
and was undergoing unspecified tests at USC University Hospital in
Boyle Heights. He was expected to remain at least through this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was taking a shower getting ready to go to a (drug
education) event when he slipped and banged his head really hard,''
said John Shallman, a consultant working on Block's campaign.
``Because he hit his head really hard, (doctors) wanted to observe
him and run some tests. Whenever someone suffers a head trauma,
they hold them for observation up to 48 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Block was taken to the hospital by paramedics who were summoned
to his home by a 911 call. Shallman said the sheriff did not lose
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department did not report
Block's hospitalization until Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials declined comment, and Shallman said he did
not know whether some other medical condition precipitated the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't comment on it because I don't know,'' Shallman said.
</P>
<P>
   The injury comes during the homestretch of Block's battle for a
fifth term in office. His challenger, Lee Baca, a former regional
chief in the department, has made a major issue of Block's failing
health, saying the popular sheriff is no longer capable of doing
the job because he is too sick. Block fought off bouts with
prostate cancer and non-Hodgkins lymphoma in the early 1990s and
now undergoes dialysis treatments three times a week for a serious
kidney ailment. He has said he will likely get a kidney transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Taylor, a campaign consultant who represented an
unsuccessful candidate, Bill Baker, in the primary race for sheriff
earlier this year, said Block's hospitalization is a ``nightmare''
for his campaign, especially this close to Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reinforces what everyone has been thinking. All of a
sudden, it's got to raise a question in the minds of voters who
have been thinking age is not an issue,'' Taylor said. ``It's
happened to a guy whose health has been an issue in his survival
for political office. It's going to be exploited either directly or
indirectly by his opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   Shallman said that despite the sheriff's fall, the campaign is
moving ``full steam ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can comment on whether this is going to be a
setback at all. We don't know whether it's going to be a problem,''
Shallman said when asked if Block would be able to keep up his
campaign schedule this week, which includes a Tuesday fund-raiser
with U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Scott, another Block consultant, said the fall was unrelated
to Block's previous health problems. ``It had nothing to do with
cancer or dialysis,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Jim Hellmold, a department spokesman who was stationed at
the hospital Sunday, said it appeared that Block would be staying
in the hospital through this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medical staff is keeping him,'' Hellmold said. ``They
haven't given us any layout of how long he's going to be in. I
don't know why they are keeping him there.''
</P>
<P>
   Block was up and alert Sunday, Hellmold said, and expressed
frustration that his hospital stay was interrupting yard work he
planned to do over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Hellmold said the sheriff actually left the hospital Saturday
afternoon after initially being treated for his injury, but then
decided to return late Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Block has been in office since 1982 and has been so popular with
voters that until this year he had never even been forced into a
runoff election. But in June, Baca forced a runoff. Baca said the
main reason he was running was because Block, his former mentor,
was too sick to run the department. Block claimed his health is not
an issue and said he had to run because no one else who wanted the
job was qualified.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Baca's campaign released a statement from the
candidate: ``I was saddened to hear the news of Mr. Block's
accident. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family for
a full and speedy recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political science professor at Claremont
Graduate School's Center for Politics and Policy, said the timing
of Block's fall is unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not helpful, clearly. It underscores one of the major
issues in the campaign,'' Jeffe said.

CARROLL MUST GET PATRIOTS BACK ON TRACK

<P>
   MIAMI _ Remember the runaway euphoria of two weeks ago? The
Patriots thrashed the Kansas City Chiefs, 40-10, and Super Bowl
fever gripped the Hub. There was talk of running the table, and
owner Bob Kraft probably figured the time was right to ask for more
stadium infrastructure dough.
</P>
<P>
   No more. The Patriots went down hard Sunday. The Miami Dolphins'
Olindo Mare kicked his fourth field goal, a 43-yarder, to beat the
Patriots, 12-9, in overtime. Appropriately, this game was played on
the 12th anniversary of the Bill Buckner game at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   This means that the once high-flying Pats are now in third
place, behind the (gulp) New York Jets in the AFC East. They
actually are tied with the Jets with a 4-3 record, but New York
wins the tie-breaker with a 3-0 division record. The Patriots are
1-2 in the division.
</P>
<P>
   Fair or unfair, Sunday's loss is going to come down on the
handsome head of Pete Carroll. He was clearly outcoached by the
hated Bill Parcells last Monday night and came through with a
second stink bomb Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to do a better job,'' Carroll said, sounding too much
like Daddy Butch Hobson. ``It starts with me. We got to put these
games behind us and get going.''
</P>
<P>
   He may live to regret those words as the itchy Kraft wonders why
his team hasn't scored a touchdown in the last six quarters against
the top two division rivals. The owner expects this team to go deep
into the playoffs, and _ five-year contract or not _ Carroll won't
get much slack if the Patriots continue to stumble.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs of Tuna hangover all over Pro Player Stadium in
this game, which sometimes looked like a Walter Johnson vs. Smoky
Joe Wood duel. Terry Glenn wasn't there. Troy Brown wasn't there.
Vincent Brisby wasn't there. In the wake of the Monday night Jet
loss, wounded hamstrings, ankles, fingers, knees, and egos
conspired to send New England to a second straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe had little going for him. He
had safety valve Ben Coates, Shawn Jefferson, and a cast of
unproven wideouts. Pitching in wind gusts of 23 miles per hour,
Bledsoe completed only 13 of 33 passes for 240 yards. He completed
only one pass to a wideout other than Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very good defense,'' said Carroll. ``Should we have
struggled that much? I would like to think not.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll and offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese will be
rightfully harpooned for poor clock management at the end of
regulation. With less than three minutes to play, New England had
the ball on the Miami 17. The score was tied, 6-6, and the Dolphins
had only two timeouts left.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom says you'd run the ball, make Miami burn
timeouts, and set up for a field goal with less than a minute to
play. Instead, the Patriots threw two incomplete passes, using no
clock and gaining no yards. When Adam Vinatieri kicked a field goal
to make it 9-6, there was still 2:13 left on the clock and Miami
had two timeouts plus the two-minute warning. The Dolphins had
plenty of time to march downfield for a tying field goal that put
the game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to win the game right there,'' Carroll said
when asked about the curious play-calling.
</P>
<P>
   (Dumping salt in the open wound, the big scoreboard in Miami
flashed news that ex-Patriot cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock had just
returned an interception 79 yards for a touchdown for the Vikings.
Why can't we get players like that?)
</P>
<P>
   This will be a rough week for Coach Pete. After the Kansas City
victory, he appeared free of all the local darts and arrows that
pierced him in his first season. The Patriots were finally
considered Carroll's team. But now he's doing less with more talent
than Parcells and Jimmy Johnson. And all the criticism will come
roaring back to his doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   This season's Super Bowl will be played in Miami, but it no
longer feels like the Patriots will be chartering back for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a game of opportunities,'' Carroll said. ``I look at
this game as missed opportunities. We had plenty of chances to win
this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Injuries or no injuries, unfair penalties or not, they should
have won the game. They have too much talent to lose back-to-back
games to the Jets and Dolphins. A lot of fans are going to blame
the coach. And he invites the critique when he tells us he needs to
do a better job.

DOLPHINS DELIVER KICK IN PANTS

<P>
   MIAMI _ The final score Sunday was more likely from an ice-cold
day on a frozen field, when offense is the last thought. This was a
million miles from that.
</P>
<P>
   It was balmy, in the 80s, and the only thing to contend with was
a 13-23-mile-per-hour wind that at times would cause passes to go
off line and kicks to fall short.
</P>
<P>
   Not Olindo Mare's 43-yard field goal in overtime against the
wind, however. And not three others in the Miami Dolphins' 12-9
victory over the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   New England, which has lost to Bill Parcells's Jets and now to
Jimmy Johnson's Dolphins, ending a four-game winning streak against
the Fish in the process, might well have thought its offense was
suffering from frostbite.
</P>
<P>
   The offense staggered from the first quarter on, as if the
players were wearing heavy mittens and overcoats. They never were
able to spring the big play, never were able to score a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   And many did not want to hear the excuse that Terry Glenn did
not make the trip, and that his absence, coupled with those of
Vincent Brisby (finger) and Troy Brown (ankle), reduced Drew
Bledsoe's weaponry to the point that he completed fewer than 50
percent of his passes (13 for 33 for 240 yards and one
interception). Or the excuse that starting fullback Tony Carter
(knee) wasn't around to lead-block for Robert Edwards (27 yards on
19 carries) and pick up the Dolphin blitzes.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this strange game, the Patriots were 4-3 overall
and 1-2 in their division, looking up at the 5-2 Dolphins and tied
with the Jets and Bills.
</P>
<P>
   The sounds of defeat filled the New England locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't look for an out,'' said Shawn Jefferson, who was the
offensive star of the game with four catches for 116 yards. ``We
expected to come out and win these games. We don't expect a dropoff
just because we're missing some people. Nobody's gonna see it that
way in the paper. They want to know did you win or didn't you? Life
doesn't accept excuses, and this football team doesn't either.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie fullback Chris Floyd, head hung low, said, ``I expected
to play well and I didn't. I found out that the game is a lot
faster than practice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' said Lawyer Milloy. ``We didn't tackle
very well. We left the middle open in some places. It's tough right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy, who was singled out by Parcells for his play last Monday
night, found himself in the middle of the trouble in OT.
</P>
<P>
   On a third-and-10 from the Dolphin 15, Milloy didn't get to Dan
Marino on a blitz, and Ty Law was called for interference against
Dolphins receiver Lamar Thomas, giving Miami a 16-yard gain and
letting it continue the drive. Milloy then was caught up in
coverage on a 25-yard pass from Marino to O.J. McDuffie. It
appeared Law had given way to Milloy to pick up McDuffie, but
Milloy wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't too much in the game plan,'' said Milloy. ``(The
Dolphins) game-planned around me. When my number was called I
didn't make the play. I always expect to make the play when I'm
called upon. I shouldn't take it upon myself and blame all of it on
me, but that's just the way I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   On the interference call, Law said, ``I didn't even touch him.
But whether it was a good call or a bad call, it's over and we lost
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins got it down to the Patriots' 26, and then Mare came
on and sealed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had an awful time on two of their last three
kickoff coverages. On one of them, John Avery returned it 37 yards
to the Dolphin 41. Miami marched to the Patriot 7, and Mare kicked
a 25-yard field goal to tie it at 9 with 49 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had taken a 9-6 lead on Adam Vinatieri's 36-yarder
with 2:13 left, driving from their 21 and hitting a big pass to
rookie receiver Tony Simmons for 47 yards down the right sideline
to the Miami 17.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots made a strange move here, opting for a run and two
passes. As coach Pete Carroll pointed out, ``We were going for it
right there. We were trying to end the game.'' But it seemed if the
Patriots kept the ball on the ground, made the Dolphins use their
timeouts, and kick the field goal with little time left, that might
have been a better option.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots trailed, 3-0, at the half. They didn't take
advantage of the conditions, electing not to attempt a 57-yard
field goal in the first quarter that Vinatieri appeared to have a
shot at with the strong wind.
</P>
<P>
   New England managed 2 yards total offense in the first quarter,
which summed up their lethargy. With about 6 1/2 minutes remaining
in the second, the Patriots had marched to the Dolphin 13, a
54-yard pass to Jefferson the big play. But on third and 13, it
wasn't the youngsters who foiled the Patriots, it was Bruce
Armstrong. He received a double penalty _ one for holding Jason
Taylor and then an unsportsmanlike penalty for shoving Taylor. The
Dolphins took the unsportsmanlike, forcing a 45-yard field goal
attempt by Vinatieri into the wind. It went wide right.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had other chances. Bledsoe overthrew Jefferson deep
on the second series of the game and then again in the third
quarter. On the third series, Bledsoe overthrew Anthony Ladd, who
had beaten his man. On the 54-yarder Jefferson caught in the second
quarter, Ladd missed a block downfield that would have sprung
Jefferson for a score. And right before Vinatieri's missed field
goal, Ben Coates dropped a ball in the end zone, appearing to get
his arm tangled with safety Calvin Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in knowing we had to make key plays in the passing
game and I didn't do it,'' Bledsoe said. ``A couple of balls
drifted on me in the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots tied it at 3 in the third quarter on Vinatieri's
41-yard field goal, on which a low snap was dug up nicely by Tom
Tupa. That came after a Law interception, the third of Marino on
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carter missed a huge chance for a special teams play when
he seemed to have a clean shot at punter Klaus Wilmsmeyer, but
attempted to block it with his hands instead of diving into the
ball. Wilmsmeyer got the punt off.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the fourth quarter, the Patriots started clicking again
as Bledsoe hit Jefferson on a comeback toss of 36 yards to the
Miami 49. On the next play, Jefferson took Buckley down the right
sideline and got caught slightly in his legs. The officials called
a 38-yard interference penalty on Buckley. The ball was at the 11,
but the Patriots could only get a 30-yard field goal to take a 6-3
lead.
</P>
<P>
   After another long kick return by Avery, which required a save
from behind by Tedy Bruschi at the Dolphin 46, Marino got the
Dolphins into range again for Mare, who booted the 38-yarder to tie
it at 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hadn't given up a touchdown in four weeks,'' said
Carroll. ``That's a heck of a defense.''

REPORT REVEALS INEQUITIES FOR FEMALE, MINORITY SCREENWRITERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Hollywood's female and minority screenwriters
still lag well behind their white male counterparts in pay and job
opportunities, a survey released today shows.
</P>
<P>
   And in a finding underscoring Hollywood's obsession with youth
-- and why 32-year-old ``Felicity'' writer Riley Weston believed
she had to pass herself off as a teen-ager to get the job -- the
survey by the Writers Guild of America West showed a bleak outlook
for older writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have much, much farther to go,'' said Daniel Petrie Jr.,
president of the guild. ``To the extent that the voices of minority
writers and women writers and older writers are absent, we are
robbing our culture of their perspectives and experiences. America
has a lot of stories to be told.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey -- the fourth conducted since 1987 -- shows
substantial gains in a few areas for women and minority writers,
such as narrowing of wage gaps, and more modest gains in others
like the overall share of employment. But white men still dominate
the business, with 70 percent of those writing for television and
79 percent of movie writers being white men.
</P>
<P>
   Women have 26 percent of the writing slots for TV shows and
minorities have 7 percent; in film, those drop to 17 percent and 5
percent, respectively. The statistics add up to more than 100
percent because minority women were counted in both categories.
</P>
<P>
   Long-time TV writer and playwright Hindi Brooks, who worked on
``Fame,'' ``The Waltons,'' ``Medical Center'' and ``Eight Is
Enough,'' believes women still have a tough time cracking barriers
in Hollywood. ``There's still a touch of the old-boys network,''
she said. ``They're uncomfortable with women on a set out of a fear
that they can't talk freely.''
</P>
<P>
   There were eight TV shows last year, all with staffs of at least
10 writers, that had no women, including ``Brooklyn South,''
``Dellaventura'' and ``Politically Incorrect,'' and another 13 with
only one, including ``Seinfeld'' and ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From 1991 to 1997, women writers' share of employment barely
changed,'' wrote authors William and Denise Bielby, professors of
sociology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. ``In
feature film, there has been virtually no change in women's share
of total employment since the early 1980s and in television there
has been little change since the early 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   Although women's share of employment has barely shifted
recently, there has been a significant narrowing of wage gaps. The
report found that minority writers have achieved near parity in the
1990s after usually being paid half the wage of white males a
decade ago. The median for white males on TV last year was $70,000,
while women were paid $66,000.
</P>
<P>
   The report found minority participation in the guild has doubled
over the past decade with total membership now at 6 percent. ``That
figure must double and double again before our industry can applaud
itself,'' Petrie said.
</P>
<P>
   The authors noted opportunities remain limited for minorities to
specific shows and networks. The Big Three -- CBS, ABC and NBC --
having only 3 percent representation by minority writers, compared
with 13 percent at Fox, 19 percent at WB and 29 percent at UPN.
``Eight percent of the 168 series analyzed for this report had no
minority writer or just one minority writer among those who
received on-screen credit during 1997-98,'' the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found a declining market for older writers with
a 32 percent employment rate for those between 51 and 50 and a 19
percent rate for those between 61 and 70 -- astoundingly low
compared with 73 percent for those under 30, 59 percent between 31
and 40 and 46 percent for those 41 to 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``I applaud the success of our youngest members, but it is
shocking that our industry continues to turn away from writers as
they age,'' Petrie said.
</P>
<P>
   The authors noted that earnings are now highest for writers in
their 30s and have declined for those over 40 since the early
1980s, when writers in their 40s and 50s were the highest paid.
``As film and television producers have increasingly targeted
younger audiences, earnings of younger writers have been bid up
substantially relative to those writers over 40 and especially
writers over 50.''
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that 77 series had no writer over 50 and six
shows, including ``Friends'' and ``Veronica's Closet,'' had no
writer over 40.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, who worked for 14 years in TV, said it is nonsense for
executives to believe that only young people can write about the
young people who dominate TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was on `Fame,' I was 40, and I was writing about high
school kids,'' she said. ``I had a couple of them at home, so if I
had a question, I'd ask, which is part of a writer's job. I'm not
saying young people have no talent, but they lack life experience,
so what executives should do is have people working in teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks also said she understands why Weston felt she had to
disguise her age.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the gray hair started to show, I was out,'' she said. ``I
didn't want to go the route of dyeing my hair. I'm back in my first
love, which is play writing, but I wish I'd been able to tell them
I was leaving rather than the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the study's authors, they hold out a dim view of the
prospects for change. ``Barriers to equal employment opportunity,
once in place, become institutionalized and rarely change in the
absence of any substantial change in a firm or industry's business,
technical or legal environment,'' they said in their concluding
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is especially true when there is a strong industry
culture, when there is a low representation of women and minorities
in decision-making positions and when decisions about hiring and
job assignment are highly subjective.''

JUST WHAT UNCLE SAM ORDERED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ You're going to love the United States' next
soccer coach. Unless, by some chance, you happen to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Arena, a New Yorker by birth and temperament, hasn't had
much practice at losing, compiling a winning percentage at the
University of Virginia that made him the sport's John Wooden,
before molding Major League Soccer's Washington franchise known as
D.C. United into the sport's New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   And his discomfort with losing was evident late Sunday afternoon
following D.C.'s controversial 2-0 loss to the Chicago Fire in the
MLS Cup in front of 51,350 fans at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. had just played its third game in eight days, which is too
many in soccer, and gotten the worst of two referee's decisions
that Arena considered pivotal, including an obviously blown offside
call on Chicago's second goal. Typically, the 47-year-old coach,
expected to be named U.S. coach on Tuesday, didn't hold back his
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing to lose that way, because it's almost as if
we weren't given a chance to defend our championship,'' Arena said.
``Playing all the games and then the refs today....''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he suffer gladly the professional fools in the press
corps.
</P>
<P>
   Arena to a reporter who asked what specifically he didn't like
about the two calls: ``I didn't like the (lack of an) offside
because it was offside. And I didn't like the non-penalty call
because it was a penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Arena to a reporter who asked a complex question about whether
he'd ordered a specific halftime adjustment: ``WHAT was that?''
Then, when the question repeated: ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Arena to a reporter who questioned D.C. United's effort after
Chicago took a 2-0 lead in the first half: ``You don't think we
fought in the second half? Why don't you go tell those 11 guys over
there? I think you're dead wrong. And I think it might reflect a
lack of understanding of soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Since I was not the target of any those blasts, I must say I
admire the spirit in which they were delivered, even if I hope to
never be stuck in an elevator with Bruce Arena.
</P>
<P>
   I want a thoroughly American coach for my national team, and
Arena certainly will be that. I want a guy who hates to lose, and
Arena certainly will be that.
</P>
<P>
   Losing has come naturally to U.S. soccer for too long.
</P>
<P>
   Arena wouldn't comment Sunday on the prospects that he'll take
the job, replacing Steve Sampson, who resigned after the United
States went 0 for the World Cup in France last summer. But a U.S.
soccer official said a press conference has been scheduled for
Tuesday in New York, and what else is there to announce, another
silly team name?
</P>
<P>
   The first question should be what took so long to hire Arena.
</P>
<P>
   He's soccer's Davey Johnson, a little prickly, a bit
opinionated, a touch demanding, and obviously the top candidate for
the job. But U.S. officials insisted on going through a lengthy
``search'' that ended up with the four candidates everybody
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's down to Arena, and the last negotiating point, his
request for a four-year contract, taking him through the 2002 World
Cup in Japan and Korea, apparently has been satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   He was in no rush. If he didn't get the job now, he might still
have gotten it before 2002, and given his relative youth, he could
have waited for the next World Cup cycle.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be sensational if he's one-tenth as successful as he was
with Virginia, where he won five NCAA titles and 80.7 percent of
his games, and with D.C., which won the first two MLS titles in
1996 and '97 and shared the best '98 regular-season record (24-8)
with the Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been through a lot of water to be tested,'' D.C. and
former U.S. national midfielder John Harkes said. ``He understands
players. He's a players' coach. You hope he can rise to the next
level.''
</P>
<P>
   He can if he can stand the losing that will come with the job,
at least at first. He is trying. He moderated his comments Sunday
to make sure to give credit to Chicago and note that despite the
referees, D.C. had chances to score.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, two MLS Cups out of three ain't bad. The United States
will take that in a New York minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready to jump off a bridge,'' Arena said, clutching a
water bottle in the humid Chicago locker room. ``There are a lot
more important things going on in the world than winning a soccer
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Which proves he's the perfect U.S. coach. What other country
would take a guy who says there's something more important than
soccer?

CHICAGO CAPTURES CUP 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Chicago has been the center of attention of
the US sporting world because of its baseball and basketball teams
recently. Now, Chicago has moved closer to the world sporting
spotlight after the Fire took a 2-0 victory over D.C. United in the
MLS Cup Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire, an expansion team that did not hold its first practice
until February, has a chance to turn Chicago into a soccer kind of
town.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Nowak, the Polish midfielder who was named most valuable
player, led the way with his skill and ability to read the game.
The Fire remained compact, used Nowak as a point of reference, and
seldom panicked when confronted with United's pressure tactics.
Chicago simply had enough technical ability to escape from trouble,
to maintain possession, and to threaten either with a slow buildup
through midfield or in counterattack. The Fire also were tactically
sound and ruthless enough defensively to stifle United's attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire capitalized on United's occasional lethargy and two
questionable refereeing decisions in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The result signaled the end of United's dynastic ambitions and
the last MLS game for United's Bruce Arena, who is slated to be
named coach of the US national team this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did what they had to do and I have tremendous respect for
them,'' Arena said of the Fire. ``The breaks didn't go our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Arena disagreed with a non-call when Marco Etcheverry went down
in the penalty area after a Lubos Kubik tackle in the third minute.
But Arena was most upset by the second goal, a shot by Nowak that
deflected off Diego Gutierrez, who appeared to be offside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second goal was not a good goal,'' Arena said. ``They
deserved to win and they should get credit. I don't want to take
anything away from Chicago or sound like sour grapes. But it's hard
to believe we are not the best team in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Arena noted that United seemed fatigued by playing its
third game in eight days, the Fire actually performed shorthanded
for most of the game, since forward Roman Kosecki was hobbled by a
hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   Most of United's weaknesses and bad habits were exposed in the
first half. The Fire set the tone early as Francis Okaroh took out
Ben Olsen with a hard tackle, sending a message to United, and
testing referee Kevin Terry, who correctly allowed rough, but fair,
play.
</P>
<P>
   United appeared to be the more threatening team early, as Roy
Lassiter, Jaime Moreno, and Etcheverry found room near the goal and
Chicago goalkeeper Zach Thornton struggled with Etcheverry's corner
kicks.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fire retained their composure, and Ante Razov hit the
post in the 20th minute. The United defense began to appear
vulnerable, and the Fire broke it down with an impressive foray
that led to Jerzy Podbrozny's goal in the 28th minute. Kubik,
moving deep into the United defense from his sweeper position, drew
three defenders before laying off to Razov. Kubik was fouled on the
play, but Terry allowed play to continue. Then, Razov one-touched a
pass to Nowak, who continued the penetration and found Podbrozny
for the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Podbrozny was the key to setting up the second goal, as he held
the ball near the halfway line and drew the United defense out.
Space opened briefly, and Podbrozny timed a pass perfectly for
Nowak, who cut across the field on the edge of the penalty area.
The shot went off Gutierrez, who appeared to be in an offside
position, and United assailed Terry with protests.
</P>
<P>
   The game concluded in a bizarre manner as Arena congratulated
Fire coach Bob Bradley with more than a minute remaining, then
Etcheverry and John Harkes appeared to slap Chicago players,
setting off a brief shoving duel in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, United's assistant coach in 1996 and '97, gathered a
group of players and guided them to a championship in eight months.
He started with mostly US players such as Okaroh, the two-time
Revolution defender of the year, then signed the Eastern Europeans,
and chose Thornton over Mexican national team goalkeeper Jorge
Campos.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the season went on, we realized we had a unique group of
players,'' Bradley said. ``They have a willingness to put out on
the field and to play intelligently.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ That was then.
</P>
<P>
   And the Boston Bruins, said goalie Rob Tallas, might be wise to
take note.
</P>
<P>
   That was a bounce-back season under first-year coach Pat Burns.
That was the arrival of Jason Allison. A return to the playoffs. A
season that got kick-started by a successful swing through the West
and went from there.
</P>
<P>
   This is now. A season that started with a Western trip that
stalled after two wins in the first three games and finished with
three straight losses, the latest a 3-1 setback against the New
Jersey Devils here Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins took Sunday off before getting back to work Monday to
prepare for Wednesday night's game at Montreal _ the team's seventh
in a row on the road _ which will be followed by a Thursday rematch
with the Canadiens at the FleetCenter. The Bruins have Carolina at
home Saturday and then are road-bound again for four of the
following five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always comparing everything to last year,'' said Tallas,
who got the loss Saturday night in his second start of the season.
``Maybe we might have to look around the dressing room and say
forget about last year. This is our team this year and let's create
things and see what happens in 1998-99 and not what happened in
1997-98.''
</P>
<P>
   What has been happening lately is not Bruins hockey, said Burns.
The Devils, he noted, threw the puck to the net and followed it
there and for their work scored a couple of less-than-pretty goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to want to finesse it all the time,'' Burns said.
``We're not good enough for that. We keep on stressing that and
we'll keep on telling them and telling them until we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Already low on manpower with unrestricted free agents Kyle
McLaren and Anson Carter not around, by the end of the trip Burns
also was missing Tim Taylor (groin injury) and Rob DiMaio (two-game
suspension). His options, Burns said, were limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to sit some guys on the bench right now,'' he said.
``But I don't have anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio is eligible again Wednesday and Burns was unsure of
Taylor's status. He said he planned on talking with the team's
brass regarding other personnel matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some personnel decisions have to be made,'' Burns said. ``We
have to sit some guys down.''
</P>
<P>
   The ones who play need to get back to the grind-it-out style
that helped Boston to a 2-0-1 start with nine goals, and away from
the effort that has the team 0-3 with a pair of goals in the last
three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it is, I'm not sure, they haven't told me,'' Burns said
of the Bruins' recent play. ``I wish they'd let me in on the
secret.''
</P>
<P>
   The message has been sent and received, said Steve Heinze. Now
it's a matter of putting it into play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're harping on getting shots and we're just not doing it,''
Heinze said. ``Shots don't just happen. It takes effort from the
defensive zone all the way in. And sometimes we're passing them
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Through two periods against the Devils, the Bruins had 10 shots.
In the second period they scored only their second power-play goal
in their last 23 chances with the man-advantage. They had 11 more
shots in the third period, none on their first power play in the
period and then three on their next, but couldn't get another goal.
</P>
<P>
   Shots, said Heinze, beget shots. Get over the blue line
uncovered, start shooting, and earn a little more room as the
defensemen back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It builds on itself,'' Heinze said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Bruins' 21 shots on net Saturday night, 11 came from
defensemen. In contrast, the Devils had 31 shots and seven were
from defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   The line of Chris Taylor, P.J. Axelsson, and Peter Ferraro had
five shots, half the total for the Bruin forwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last three or four games, we've been a little too fancy
around the net and we're not putting it on net, including myself,''
Ferraro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we've got to be a little more selfish around the
net and shoot more. We've got to play our own style. I can't be
Sergei Samsonov or Jason Allison, I've got to play my own game. We
have to do what got us here. Get more or less garbage goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Any goals. And now would be helpful.

   PASADENA, Calif. _ In deviating sharply from its previous form,
the Chicago Fire pulled off success Sunday through an offensive
display.
</P>
<P>
   For the expansion Fire, a defensive-minded unit unaccustomed to
generating creative attacks, its initial multitouch sequence in
Sunday's MLS Cup '98 was so precise, it immediately parlayed itself
into ``a few'' others. Such as a quick third touch on the ball,
then a fourth, then a fifth...
</P>
<P>
   Gooooal!
</P>
<P>
   By the time D.C. United's dizzied defenders figured out what
happened, Jerzy Podbrozny's tap-in 29 minutes into the first half
capped the Fire's beautiful, six-touch passing sequence, laying the
primary groundwork to halt two-time defending champion United's
reign. Until then, the teams had combined for 15 shots in an
action-filled first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``And people say our team just packs the back and plays ugly
long ball,'' Chicago coach Bob Bradley joked. ``Well, we can finish
too and D.C. saw that.''
</P>
<P>
   In a manner of speaking, it was Armageddon Day for the United,
as both ``El Diablo'' (Marco Etcheverry) and ``The Pope'' (Eddie
Pope) went down in a hellish Fire.
</P>
<P>
   Just to make sure, Chicago's defense then reverted to old form
by doing to United what it had previously done to the Galaxy:
outexecute superior talent by dictating the game's flow.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first 28 minutes, Chicago never crossed the ball nor
even had a second touch in its attacking third of the field. Most
of its chances were simply limited to dribble-in-and-shoot
scenarios. But it didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Fire was mostly busy besieging D.C.'s high-powered
offense. Only twice were United players left unattended to while in
prime position, with neither chance being finished. But once the
Fire scored the key first goal, strategies changed.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than push the ball up, the trailing United was actually
forced to overload its back line with five players, ill-affording a
two-goal deficit against the league's premier defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to,'' United coach Bruce Arena explained. ``When we
didn't get the breaks early, it was a case where we had to be just
about perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the Fire scored again in the final minute of the half,
on a heavily disputed offsides noncall, the floodgates were flung
open.
</P>
<P>
   ``One goal down, I think the game looked a little different,''
Arena added.
</P>
<P>
   ``But maybe the way it was today, a whole lot of goals were not
going to go in because of the way (Chicago keeper Zach) Thornton
was playing and the way players were blocking shots''
</P>
<P>
   Making matters more frustrating, Arena felt Etcheverry had been
fouled in Chicago's penalty box earlier in the match. Chicago
committed 27 fouls for the contest, to just eight for United.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to take away from the Fire's day, but we had an
opinion on the officiating today,'' Arena said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Arena's qualms, Chicago had clearly earned the title,
with every one of United's chances having to be earned. Meanwhile,
of the few good chances the Fire's offense had, only one went
unconverted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started building our team, we never thought we were
supposed to be a good team,'' Bradley said. ``We worked hard all
year and as the season progressed ... we knew we could compete for
a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweetest of all for Bradley was the team effort, which Arena
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can talk all they want about (Chris) Armas marking
(Marco),'' Arena said. ``But it was all 11 men that marked him.
Their whole defense was a swarm.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ Sunday's Patriots-Dolphins game was a rare one for the
National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   What happened, a low-scoring contest, was what the average Joe
Football thought might occur, and seldom is that ever the case.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Patriots missing receivers Terry Glenn and Troy
Brown from an offense that already was struggling, they simply
could not move the ball consistently against a Miami defense that
gambles on virtually every play.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's defense is the football version of Russian roulette. The
Dolphins roll the dice all the time, gambling that they won't get
hit with the big play.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, they swallowed up the Patriots' running game. Robert
Edwards had 19 carries for 27 yards and was never a factor. This
forced the Patriots to throw the ball, and there were several
factors going against them.
</P>
<P>
   No Glenn. No Brown. A strong wind. A noisy crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd was great,'' said Miami linebacker Zach Thomas. ``It
was so noisy New England couldn't check off and go to an audible.
(Drew) Bledsoe had to go with what he had. Under the circumstances,
I thought he did a good job. It's hard to play with new guys (Tony
Simmons and Anthony Ladd) in a situation like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither team could do a thing on first down, meaning neither
offense was able to dictate to the defense. In fact, it was the
other way around. In the entire game, the Patriots had one rushing
first down, Miami two.
</P>
<P>
   On first downs, the Patriots had 11 runs for 31 yards, and three
completions in nine attempts for 36 yards. Twenty plays, 67 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Miami forced them into third-and-long situations and then came
after Bledsoe. He really had only two weapons, Shawn Jeff-eson deep
and Ben Coates short. The Dolphins doubled Coates most of the time
and made it tough to get the ball to him.
</P>
<P>
   The only New England success came when the blitz was picked up
and Terrell Buckley had to cover Jefferson deep man-to-man. Bledsoe
exploited this matchup, and Jefferson had four catches for 116
yards. Coates had four catches for 49 yards. The two accounted for
165 of the Patriots' 251 total net yards.
</P>
<P>
   New England's defense had similar success against Miami on first
down. The Dolphins ran 13 times for 26 yards. And Dan Marino threw
four times, with two completions, for 17 yards during regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, New England defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell
said the top priority of his unit was to shut down the Dolphins on
third down. ``We want to get off the field on third, and keep them
from sustaining drives,'' said Sidwell. The Patriots did a great
job of it, as Miami converted just four of 16 third-down chances.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams lived by the blitz, in 1990s football, attacking the
line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots attacked the line of scrimmage on first down and
stuffed Karim Abdul-Jabbar. Then, with Marino in throwing
situations _ not where coach Jimmy Johnson wanted him to be _ the
Patriots brought in a substitute defensive package, with seven
defensive backs most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   This group put tremendous pressure on Marino, and he didn't like
it. From the start of the game, he was moving uncomfortably in the
pocket and making some terrible throws, which longtime Marino
followers are not used to seeing.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar does not have the speed to get outside. And the
Miami receivers do not have the speed to get deep. Marino focused
on getting the ball to O.J. McDuffie, the one veteran he could
count on to be in the right place at the right time. Ty Law did a
good job of staying with McDuffie in man-to-man situations. If
Marino got the ball to him, there wasn't a lot of room.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth period, when the momentum seemed to turn toward
Miami, the Patriots defense wore down. The players didn't seem to
have the same zip they had earlier. Marino, with a little more
time, threw the ball better and moved his team into position for
the field goals that got Miami the victory in the closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do a lot different (at the end),'' said Marino, ``We
just started hitting some plays that you need to make in this
league in order to be successful. We did what we had to do to get
into field goal position.
</P>
<P>
   ``New England did the same things (they had in the past). They
switched some coverages up in second down that we weren't
expecting. Give them a lot of credit. They have a good defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Patriots must get their offense to the same level. They
had a chance to put the AFC East out of reach in the last two
games, and instead made it a race.

PATRIOTS DEFENSE PULLED OUT ALL STOPS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ One of the last to leave a devastated Patriots locker
room after Sunday's 12-9 loss to the Dolphins was Ted Johnson.
Lawyer Milloy had sat a long time at his locker, his head in a
towel, Shawn Jefferson had exploded into an outburst, and others
rued a victory that had gotten away. Yet another.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of times where we really could have sealed (a
win),'' said Johnson. ``The thing was we kept fighting them and
fighting them and our offense did the best they could and our
defense did some good things. But it just leaves a bad taste in
your mouth, knowing that we really did the things to win the game
... but we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   But when plays had to be made, plays that win football games,
the Patriots didn't make them. It seemed they had, especially when
Adam Vinatieri capped a 61-yard drive by kicking a 36-yard field
goal with 2:13 left in regulation for a 9-6 lead. But then the
other two-thirds of the team _ special teams and defense _ let down
and New England lost a game it could have won. For the second week
in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The special teams allowed Miami's John Avery to return a kickoff
37 yards to the Miami 41. ``They ran some returns we hadn't seen,''
said New England special teams specialist Larry Whigham, ``and me,
myself, I was out of whack. I just didn't play it well.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Marino needed little more than a minute to move his Dolphins
into range for the tying field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the overtime, Bruce Armstrong calling tails for the
Patriots and the coin falling heads. Miami had the ball, and, after
a controversial pass interference call against New England's Ty
Law, the Patriots pass defense went spongy. As Johnson put it, ``We
left some keys open on some key downs.''
</P>
<P>
   The call against Law could have gone either way. Miami had a
third and 10 on its 15, the key moment of the game, and Marino
dropped to pass. The Patriots' Milloy, who had an unfortunate game,
was coming on a blitz and the safety had a clean shot at Marino.
But Milloy missed.
</P>
<P>
   Marino fired to his left toward Lamar Thomas, and both receiver
and defender dived for the ball at the sideline. ``You seen it and
everybody seen it _ I had better position than he did,'' said Law.
``But the guys in those stripes make the calls and it just gave
them another chance. But I don't see any other way I could have
played (the pass).''
</P>
<P>
   Flush with a first down, instead of punting from deep in its
territory, Miami soon was down to the Patriot 26. The key play here
was when the Patriots, in a zone, left O.J. McDuffie open as Law
apparently released McDuffie to Milloy, but Milloy was slow on the
coverage. The gain was from the Miami 35 to the Patriots' 40, the
Dolphins only a first down or so from the winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a great call defensively on that catch,'' said
McDuffie. ``We had two guys running quick out patterns and they
rolled into Cover-2 (a zone defense). But Danny read Cover-2 on the
right side and then turned and fired it my way (on the left). He
put it in the right place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's really tough to swallow,'' said Milloy.
``Right now, we're worrying about the New England Patriots, how to
get better, how to start winning. It'll all start falling into
place once we get things corrected. Right now we've got to get some
guys back healthy. We were playing kind of conservative in some
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, until the late meltdown, the Patriot defense had more
than done its job, picking off three passes (giving the Patriots 13
picks in their last four games against Marino). And its play in the
first quarter was superb, turning the ball over to the offense
three times in ideal field position _ the Miami 41-, 45-, and
45-yard lines _ but the offense failed to score a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to do a better job,'' said coach Pete Carroll after his
team squandered an opportunity for the second week in a row. ``I
need to give some help, to find a way on both sides (of the ball).
It starts with me and will work its way all the way down, to find a
way to move the ball and to get the stops we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the very end, the game seemed a 1998 re-enactment of the
Canton Bulldogs vs. the Decatur Staleys as Miami _ a team with
little offense and an excellent defense _ traded punt after punt
with the Patriots, a team with a depleted offense. The wind was
making passing difficult for both teams, New England was down to
only one regular receiver, Jefferson, and its running game was
foiled by many factors, including the Dolphins' defense and the
fact that rookie Chris Floyd is not the lead blocker Tony Carter
is.
</P>
<P>
   So the game would be won by the team that finally made a play.
The Patriots had one virtually given to them when Miami punted late
in the third quarter, the score tied, 3-3, from its 49-yard line.
Because of a blocking mixup by the Dolphins, the Patriots' Chris
Carter was untouched and in on Miami punter Klaus Wilmsmeyer almost
as soon as he took the snap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got in there so fast, I just missed an opportunity,''
said Carter. ``I was just trying to take it off his foot and what
happened was I missed, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' defense ``played well,'' said linebacker Chris
Slade. ``I just think the thing is we didn't make any plays when we
needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is football's old indictment of a team that is
good but not as good as it should be.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ It was a game the Seahawks could not afford to lose,
but one they definitely could have and perhaps should have.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they escaped with a 27-20 victory over the San Diego
Chargers Sunday because Joey Galloway made three huge plays; the
defense contorted that old bend-but-don't-break line to ridiculous
extremes; John Friesz stepped in and also stepped up while subbing
for the injured Warren Moon; and they even got a couple of
favorable calls from the officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care,'' Friesz said about the circumstances. ``All
that matters is, we won.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory, secured only after Ryan Leaf threw three
incompletions from the Seahawk 3-yard line in the final 11 seconds,
snapped a three-game losing streak and lifted the Seahawks to 4-3
entering a Sunday night game against the surprisingly 5-2 Oakland
Raiders at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers slipped to 3-5 entering their bye week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord, it was a really tough football game,'' said Seahawks
coach Dennis Erickson, looking exhausted from riding an emotional
roller coaster before a boisterous crowd of 58,512 fans at Qualcomm
Stadium. ``Anytime you win a division game on the road it's a big
win.''
</P>
<P>
   This big win _ the Seahawks' first in the AFC West after
back-to-back losses to the Kansas City Chiefs and Denver Broncos _
was built on big plays. And none were bigger than the thrillogy
turned in by Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you say about Joey?'' Erickson said. ``He made three
big plays that were unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   And each outdid the previous.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks had talked for two weeks about getting Galloway
into position to make big plays against a Chargers defense that
challenged receivers with bump-and-run coverage despite being
without Dwayne Harper, its best cornerback, and with cornerback
Terrance Shaw not at full speed because of a sprained knee.
</P>
<P>
   On the Seahawks' second possession, Galloway found himself in
single coverage against Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' said Friesz, who saw the advantage and passed
to Galloway a step-and-a-half behind Shaw at the San Diego 49-yard
line. Galloway escaped Shaw's tackle and turned the completion into
an 81-yard touchdown that was the longest scoring reception of his
career, the longest scoring pass of Friesz's career and the longest
play in an afternoon crammed full of them.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second quarter, Galloway struck again. He
fielded Darren Bennett's 53-yard punt at the Seattle 26, juked and
twisted past a couple of Chargers and was gone. The 74-yard punt
return pushed the Seahawks lead to 17-3.
</P>
<P>
   But the play that saved the day, and will be discussed and
reviewed for days, came in the fourth quarter. The Chargers had
pulled to within 20-17 and control of this game was slipping away
from the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   On first down from the Seattle 43, Friesz lofted a pass toward
the goal line. Shaw got to the ball first, but Galloway was just a
blink behind. Both had their hands wrapped around the ball as they
tumbled to the turf at the 2-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Back judge Bobby Skelton should have made the call, but he fell
on the play. After a brief conference, held amid a shower of boos
and debris thrown from the stands, the officials ruled the catch
was made simultaneously. Possession Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simultaneous-catch rule states that when the offensive
player and the defensive player both come down with the ball, that
the ball belongs to the offensive team,'' referee Larry Nemmers
explained. ``The back judge fell down. He saw the simultaneous
catch prior to falling down. That's what he said and both the field
judge and the side judge came in, and after the conversation all
concurred ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite everyone agreed. Shaw argued so vehemently that he was
ejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we caught it,'' said June Jones, named Chargers
interim coach last week after Kevin Gilbride was fired. ``It looked
like we caught it and they just kind of wrapped us up. The only
thing I say is the official who made the call was on his back
rolling into the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Galloway just grinned every time he was asked about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely thought it was a good call,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Good or not, the call and the completion stood. Two plays later,
Ricky Watters leaped over a pile of players and into the end zone
to give the Seahawks a 27-17 lead with less than nine minutes to
play.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks needed that play, because Leaf, the rookie
quarterback from Washington State, led the Chargers to a field goal
on their next possession and to the Seahawks' 3-yard line before
throwing those final three incompletions.
</P>
<P>
   What, the Seahawks lucky? Probably. Apologetic? Definitely not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time we got some breaks,'' defensive end Michael
Sincalir said.
</P>
<P>
   As Friesz put it, forget that the Chargers held huge edges in
offensive plays (85 to 43), yards (391 to 274), first downs (27 to
14) and time of possession (38:06 to 21:54).
</P>
<P>
   This was a game the Seahawks had to win, and somehow they did.

JEFFERSON NOT RECEPTIVE TO TALK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Precisely because Sunday's game would have been so noble
to win _ a depleted Patriots team playing tough defense before a
sold-out Pro Player Stadium _ New England's loss in overtime became
all the more ignoble.
</P>
<P>
   And wide receiver Shawn Jefferson was the most irate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life doesn't make any excuses, so why should we?'' said
Jefferson, furious that his team lost, 12-9, in overtime to the
Dolphins. ``A dropoff because we were missing some of our wide
receivers? Hell, you start making excuses like that, you might as
well quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson launched into tirade after tirade each time the
subject of the Patriots missing Terry Glenn, Troy Brown, and
Vincent Brisby from their receiver corps was brought up. Just the
mere mention of the word ``injuries'' and Jefferson was off again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no excuses on this team,'' Jefferson fairly shouted.
``You don't look for ways out on this team ... just because we have
two rookies out there ... just because we're three receivers down.
That don't matter. We lost the game. WE LOST THE GAME. We expect to
win every game we're in. That's the Patriot way.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots had won this game, Jefferson would have been one
of the heroes. Even though the Patriots had no running game, even
though swirling winds made passing difficult, even though the Miami
defense was able to concentrate almost entirely on Jefferson, the
veteran caught four passes for 116 yards, including two huge grabs
on third down, one a 54-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   Even more, the Dolphins secondary twice was called for holding
Jefferson and was called for pass interference for 38 yards midway
through the fourth quarter, a call that set up the field goal that
gave the Patriots a 6-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the mere mention of anybody on the Patriots playing well _
let alone Jefferson _ caused the receiver to explode again. ``We
didn't get the job done,'' Jefferson said time and again. ``This
game was frustrating because we did not win.''
</P>
<P>
   But you played well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care; we didn't win,'' came Jefferson's immediate
reply. ``Nothing was good out there, nothing! Somebody played a
good game, no matter. We lost ... bottom line ... and it hurts like
hell. (Expletive) that, that we had rookies out there. We just
didn't get the job done. It doesn't matter that we didn't have
regular guys out there. Those guys aren't here and it doesn't
matter about them. Life doesn't accept excuses, and neither do
we.''
</P>
<P>
   The two rookies, Tony Simmons and Anthony Ladd, actually made an
impact, even though Simmons caught the only pass between them. Ladd
was wide open for a TD pass from the Miami 39 on the Patriots'
first drive of the game, but Drew Bledsoe overthrew him and Ladd's
desperate dive could not reach the ball. And Simmons set up the
tie-breaking score for New England when he beat Miami's Terrell
Buckley down the right sideline for a 47-yard gain to the Dolphin
17 with three minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just glad that Drew had the confidence to throw the ball
up the field to me,'' said Simmons of his hitch-and-go pattern that
easily eluded Buckley. Simmons made an easy catch, and his only
regret was that he couldn't stay inbounds for a touchdown on a day
when it seemed if either team scored a TD it would have created an
insurmountable lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to stay inbounds and do the best I could, but I
couldn't stay inbounds,'' he said. But the rookie said he was glad
to have his first true test over with ``because you're always
thinking what's it going to be like to be out there. You're scared
and thinking of what's going to happen, but now I know.''
</P>
<P>
   After Simmons's catch, coach Pete Carroll went for a TD instead
of running the ball and running down the clock. Jefferson was open
on a slant on a second-and-12 from the Miami 13, but Bledsoe
underthrew him. Then, on third down, Bledsoe looked for Simmons on
a fade pattern in the right corner of the end zone. The pass was
incomplete, but a case could have been made for pass interference
on the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should have been a flag, but I don't make the calls,''
said Simmons. ``Buckley was pushing me and he never looked back to
the ball and he was pushing me away from the ball, and that's a
flag. A DB who never looks at the ball and he's pushing you ...
that's a flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson was not only irate about the loss but added, ``I
didn't do a good enough job coaching the two young guys. I got to
do a better job coaching 'em this week.''

OFFENSE STILL ON BYE WEEK, SO SEAHAWKS TURN TO LUCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ If the offense in the first half Sunday was
representative of what the Seahawks can fix with two weeks of
preparation, be happy that these guys have chosen football as a
profession and not residential home contracting.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, they would run plumbing into the electrical panel,
fry the house and take out the neighborhood substation.
</P>
<P>
   From This Old House to This Here Lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, NFL games come with second halves, which in this
case brought redemption. Not renaissance, nor recovery. Just a
chance for the offense to make up for a mess that may well have
stood as a monument to embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Seahawks were lucky.
</P>
<P>
   It's about time, Pete Kendall insists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time since I've played here that we can say
we were outplayed by the other team, and still won,'' said the
fourth-year Seahawk guard. ``Nobody can offer up a vociferous
argument that we outplayed them. We didn't, most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in that locker room (of a good game come to
naught). I like this one. I feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   In a game that figured to be a breakout after three straight
losses and a bye week of repairs, the Seahawks, just as the Huskies
did a day earlier, needed a last-play defensive stop to avoid upset
by a mediocre opponent.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of San Diego rookie quarterback Ryan Leaf's
coming-out celebration as a pro football player, it may well have
been that the Seahawk career of Dennis Erickson and his coaches
hung by a party streamer or two. A fourth straight loss, this one
to a losing team that recently fired its coach, easily could have
set off an unstoppable chain reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, after a harrowing 27-20 win by the Joey Galloway
Admiration Society over the fortune-challenged Chargers, the
Seahawks at least can dream that the chain reaction goes in the
other direction.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it: A team that managed just 13 offensive plays in
the first half still had 17 points. Something was coming up other
than snake eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to take our odds at that time to Vegas,''
Kendall said, ``but we changed up some things and made it work in
the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the Seahawks abandoned their two-back offense and
quit trying to run around a Charger defense that was rated No. 1 in
the NFL entering the game. Erickson shifted to a three-wide
receiver formation that spread the defense, then sent running back
Ricky Watters up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   As rescue plans go, it allowed everyone to stop the panicky
recall of the speech that begins, ``In the event of a water landing
... ''
</P>
<P>
   After a first half of two first downs and and 103 yards of
offense _ 81 on one play _ the Seahawks in the second half had 12
first downs and 171 yards. While not exactly evoking images of the
Showtime Lakers of the 1980s, the Seahawks did get a field goal and
touchdown in two of their last three possessions. And since the
Charger defense had allowed more than 23 points only once this
season, the feat had some legs.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it required a generous interpretation of the
simultaneous-catch rule that gave Galloway a 41-yard reception and
the Seahawks a first down at the San Diego 2-yard line. They scored
from there two plays later.
</P>
<P>
   Charger cornerback Terrance Shaw appeared to have at least as
much of the ball as the Israelis have of the West Bank, but a
convocation of world leaders was not possible to arbitrate this
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Back judge Boris Cheek found himself tumbling over the prone
players, who were doing their Diamond Dallas Page-Hulk Hogan thing
on the ground. Apparently from an upside-down position, Cheek
deduced since both players had possession, the ball by rule belongs
to the offense.
</P>
<P>
   The majesty, as well as the elasticity, involved in this
decision apparently escaped many in the crowd of 58,512. Still
cranky after seeing their baseball Padres blown out four days
earlier at the World Series in this same unfortunately named
ballpark, fans hurled invective and beer in almost equal amounts
upon those foolish enough to stray near the north end zone.
</P>
<P>
   They did not realize that the Seahawks, operating with decades
worth of karmic backup featuring bad owners, bad players, bad
headlines and, presumably, yellow waxy buildup, were due to catch a
break. These cosmic forces simply cannot be underestimated, as San
Diego fans who watched Trevor Hoffman and Ken Caminiti should know.
</P>
<P>
   After three weeks of playing well and losing to the likes of
Pittsburgh, Kansas City and Denver, the Seahawks played mostly
lousy and won. Even the heretofore reliable defense was abused by
the Chargers and Leaf, who finally looked a little like the
studhoss he was at Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   But Leaf faltered at the end, and the Seahawks got one back from
the Vault of Eternal Misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ugly as it looked, it didn't matter,'' said quarterback John
Friesz. ``For years, we've had the breaks go against us, especially
me. I don't care. We'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   As standard-time darkness helped to cover their escape out of
town, the Seahawks looked back for a posse. Finding none, they
smiled for the first time in a month.

NOW IT GETS NASTY FOR WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ By dusk Sunday, the narrow escape against Oregon State
was only a memory for the University of Washington football team.
Practice took place on the grass field, to approximate the Los
Angeles Coliseum. Scout-team members wore maroon-and-gold jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was headed in a positive direction. Good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what you get ready for,'' said UW coach Jim Lambright.
``It's getting close to November.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies play USC (5-3) Saturday, followed by a game at
Oregon (6-1), and a home game with UCLA (6-0). Washington is a
5-point underdog to the Trojans and almost certainly won't be
favored against either the Ducks or the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Only once since 1977 has Washington been an underdog in three
straight games _ the Huskies assumed a slight underdog role in four
successive games in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is in that position because of several frailties, but
the Huskies are also 5-2, a fact Lambright doesn't want overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a team that's done what it's had to do to keep itself
competitive,'' he said. ``People tend to look at it as, are you
good enough to blow people out, rather than, is a win a win?''
</P>
<P>
   Lambright believes his team might be steeled for the stretch by
what it experienced early.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why you play a tough schedule,'' he said. ``Hopefully,
we played a tough enough schedule up front that gets us ready later
on. There are teams in our conference right now that are finally
dealing with injuries from having played highly rated opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies have gone through those trials, but still have more
hurdles to clear. Today, fullback Pat Conniff and defensive end
Odell George are due for magnetic resonance imaging tests to
determine the severity of knee injuries sustained in the 35-34
victory over Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   At best, it doesn't appear either would be ready for USC.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies seem to present a classic case of a glass being
half-empty or half-full. They are 5-2 despite:
</P>
<P>
   -- A running game that seems to defy solution.
</P>
<P>
   -- A pass defense that collapsed Saturday and allowed OSU 388
yards in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   -- Being outscored 51-14 in the fourth quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
   As for the running game, Lambright said the Huskies would even
consider the use of backup quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo _ their
only productive runner this year _ as a running back, although it
seems doubtful Washington could do that extensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll definitely consider it,'' Lambright said. ``We'll go
through everything.''
</P>
<P>
   On defense, Washington rarely plays five-man or six-man
secondaries, and didn't Saturday when OSU mounted its comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because of the number of defensive backs,'' Lambright
said. ``You take out somebody who's experienced (a linebacker) for
somebody who's got speed. Another defensive back would not have
helped us.''
</P>
<P>
   What would help is the return of Jermaine Smith, the veteran
corner who hasn't played since the loss to Arizona on Oct. 3. He
practiced some last night and could be available Saturday, pending
a reading today on how much soreness he feels.

QB DOES KICKING _ OF HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ On a day in which he became the second-fastest NFL
player to reach 20,000 passing yards and the fastest to reach 3,116
passing attempts, Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe didn't look
like a man who was thinking about personal accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   The fact was Bledsoe, who was 13 for 33 for 240 yards and one
interception, was kicking himself for missing on some long throws
downfield in a 12-9 overtime loss to the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very frustrating game,'' said Bledsoe. ``We had great
field position early on, but we were unable to capitalize on it.
Coming into the game, we thought it would be a game of field
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give them credit. They have a defense that is athletic and
fast. We felt we had to make some big plays with the passing game,
but we didn't make enough of them. Early on, I didn't hit the big
passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe had Shawn Jefferson alone deep downfield on the second
series of the game on a second-and-10, but the ball got away from
him and got caught in the gusty wind that was behind Bledsoe's
back. He missed Jefferson again in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On the third series of the game, he overthrew Anthony Ladd, who
had beaten coverage on third and 10 from the Patriots' 45.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple of passes that made it a field-position
game,'' said Bledsoe. ``First, they played a conservative,
run-the-ball, control offense. Also, the wind took a couple of my
passes. The wind was swirling pretty hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe wouldn't make any excuses for the team being without
three receivers _ Terry Glenn (hamstring), Troy Brown (ankle), and
Vincent Brisby (finger). He connected on a nifty 47-yard reception
to rookie Tony Simmons in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three guys out who can make plays,'' said Bledsoe.
``We have three kids who are playing, and I'm not going to shy away
from throwing them the ball. These guys are on our team now, and
they'll be on our team in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, who was sacked twice and hit often after he released
the ball, took a pounding from the Dolphins' front line. As usual,
he came out of it unscathed, and came away feeling the team can
only improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very big game for us,'' said Bledsoe. ``But by no
means is the season over. We need to battle back and overcome the
adversity if we are going to win the division like this team has
the past couple of years. Now Miami is in first place. We are
playing in a tough division. I don't think people realized how
tough this division was going to be at the start of the season.''

WILD FIRE SNUFFS UNITED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The stranglehold D.C. United had on Major
League Soccer came crashing down in a blaze of smoky red _ not
glory.
</P>
<P>
   The third championship so many had predicted, along with the
dynasty that would have followed for the two-time defending
champion United, moved to a place where dynasties belong in the
'90s _ Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Representing a town where championships mean everything, the
Chicago Fire became Da Fire, beating favored United 2-0 on Sunday
in the MLS Cup final in front of 51,350 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   From Chicago midfielder Chris Armas' masterful defensive job on
playmaking wizard and league MVP Marco Etcheverry, to the brilliant
assists from Chicago's own playmaker and game MVP Peter Nowak, the
Fire went from the expansion boys of March to the unlikely
champions of October.
</P>
<P>
   The match featured the relationship between Chicago coach Bob
Bradley, whose roots with United coach Bruce Arena include the '96
and '97 championships when he was Arena's assistant at D.C. Also,
Bradley's memorable loss in 1993 when his Princeton-coached squad
lost to Arena's powerful Virginia team in the semifinals of the
NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The past doesn't matter now. Bradley proudly watched his
masterful plan work wonders on his former boss as the Fire created
chance after chance against the champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt as the year went on that we had a unique group of
players who have what it takes to compete for a championship,''
Bradley said. ``This team didn't just defend as people said. To be
a good team includes both attacking and defending and that's what
you saw today.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory probably meant more to Armas than anyone. Two years
ago, Armas was part of the Galaxy team that blew a 2-0 lead to
United in the first MLS Cup final, losing a 3-2 heartbreaker in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Up 2-0 again, Armas thought about '96 the entire second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question, I thought about it (the two-goal lead in
'96),'' Armas said. ``This was three years of hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team, the media had a lot to say with trying to keep us
down, but all that matters is what happens on that field. We showed
today that we're among the best in the league. Say you want about
the way we play as long as you say we're champions.''
</P>
<P>
   The match didn't go without its controversies. In the opening
minute, soon after United's Jaime Moreno missed an open shot from
10 yards out, Etcheverry appeared to be taken down in the penalty
area, but referee Kevin Terry allowed play to go on. Moments later,
Chicago answered with probably its best piece of work this season.
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Diego Gutierrez started the sequence just outside the
D.C. box, passing to Lubos Kubik. Kubik caught United off-guard
with a quick flick pass down the left flank to an unmarked Nowak.
Nowak cut inside, dropping a pass back to Ante Razov who quickly
returned it.
</P>
<P>
   Nowak drove toward the goal behind the defense, forcing United
goalkeeper Tom Presthus off his line. At the last second, Nowak
slipped a pass to his right for Jerzy Podbrozny, who easily
finished with an open net to give Chicago a 1-0 lead in the 29th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire finished United with a controversial goal in the 45th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   From the left side, Nowak cut right, keeping United defender
Tony Sanneh to his left. Nowak then tried a quick shot from
15-yards straightaway that ricocheted off Gutierrez, who was
credited with the goal as he raced toward the net. With Razov close
in an offside position, the ball trickled in with United players
screaming for Razov's offsides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The breaks certainly didn't go our way,'' Arena said. ``It's
hard for me to believe we are not champions. The missed call on
Etcheverry was a big call. The offsides that wasn't called was big,
but give them (Chicago) credit. They deserved to be champions and I
don't want to take away from the Fire's day.''
</P>
<P>
   United outshot Chicago 22-10, but many of those shots came late
in the second half as the Fire protected its lead.

LEAF'S STOCK ON RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Fifty-two passes. Twenty-five completions. No
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Leaf's best day as a pro quarterback wasn't good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't measure success by statistics,'' the San Diego
Chargers rookie said Sunday. ``If you don't win, the repercussions
take it all away.''
</P>
<P>
   Not entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``He grew up a lot,'' said Chargers interim head coach June
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   After spending the first seven games of his NFL career making
people wonder why he was so highly regarded in the first place,
sparring with the media and irritating fans, teammates, coaches and
even his dad, Leaf played Sunday like a first-round draft choice in
a 27-20 loss to the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt comfortable out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with an ultraconservative game plan, Leaf cautiously kept
the underdog Chargers in a game they trailed by seven points with
2:43 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Then he became vintage Leaf. The Washington State version.
</P>
<P>
   Operating from the shotgun, he directed the Chargers toward a
game-tying touchdown, completing passes to Charlie Jones for 14
yards, tight end Freddie Jones for 15, Bryan Still for 7, Charlie
Jones again for 17 more, and finally to Mikhael Ricks for 12.
</P>
<P>
   With time as the enemy, Leaf had 11 seconds remaining to get
three more yards. But his final three tosses fell incomplete. So
he's no John Elway. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   The game-ender was intended for Charlie Jones, running just
beyond the goal line toward the front corner of the end zone. The
pass was wide right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't see (Jones) and just threw it where I thought he
would be,'' Leaf said. ``I couldn't see him and I don't think he
could see me, either.''
</P>
<P>
   On the previous play, Leaf tried to duplicate a throw he made to
Ricks in the second quarter, a perfectly timed toss to the back
corner that ended Leaf's touchdown-pass drought of 24-plus
quarters. But the second time, Leaf's pass sailed over Ricks' head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just got out of my hand and took off on me,'' Leaf said.
``I have to give Mikhael Ricks a chance on that play.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was close but no celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it wasn't a total loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan picked it up today and I'm proud of him,'' said Charlie
Jones, who caught six passes for 85 yards. ``That's the best our
offense has played all season. It's something to build on.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the game, Leaf built his stats on short tosses.
There were dinks to the right, some to the left, and a few more to
the middle. His only pass that traveled more than 20 yards in the
air came on an impromptu play in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf, in the shotgun formation, fumbled the snap, picked up the
ball, scrambled out of immediate danger and tried to connect with
Charlie Jones near the goal line. The pass fell incomplete, but
Seahawk defender Fred Thomas was penalized for pass interference.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having a strong throwing arm that produced eight
300-plus-yard games for the Rose Bowl Cougars last year, Leaf said
a conservative approach is the best way to build his confidence in
the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very comfortable with the game plan June is using,''
Leaf said. ``He doesn't want to put me in a position where I have
to force things.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf has been there, done that.
</P>
<P>
   The second pick in the NFL draft, Leaf threw 12 interceptions in
his first six games. He hasn't thrown any, however, since Jones
replaced Kelvin Gilbride as the head coach two games ago.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf went into Sunday's game as the 29th-rated quarterback in
the league, but moved up several notches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like everything was kind of in slow motion (Sunday),''
he said. ``I was seeing things a lot better. It's like June says,
`Excellence is not a behavior, it's a habit.' ''

DEFENSE, KICKER BIG PART OF STORY

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ When someone mentioned that the Patriots didn't have all
of their weapons for Sunday's game against the Dolphins, Zach
Thomas didn't want to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's their fault,'' said the tough Miami middle linebacker,
who stopped the New England running game almost by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to play with what you have ready,'' he said. ``We had
to beat whoever they had out there. This was a real big game for
us. If we lost this one, it would have been real tough to come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Dolphins, trying to stay in the running for the AFC East
title, did not lose.
</P>
<P>
   They won without much from their offense. It was the defense and
Olindo Mare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mare is a great athlete,'' said a jubilant Miami coach Jimmy
Johnson when he had the 12-9 victory tucked in his pocket on Mare's
four field goals. That might be a first, an NFL coach calling a
kicker a great athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to make those big kicks,'' said Johnson of Mare's field
goals that tied the game at 9 in the final minute of regulation and
won it in overtime. ``He was real cool. This was a big, big win for
us. Especially to come back the way we did at the end. Our defense
gave us a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither team scored a touchdown. Playing in a strong wind, 13-23
miles per hour out of the northeast, every ball that went into the
air seemed to be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino had a tough day. He threw three
interceptions and was under heavy pressure all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They blitzed us like they did in the games a year ago,'' said
Miami center Tim Ruddy. ``We couldn't run the ball. They took that
away from us. In run situations, they just all went for the ball
and took away the outside. We could get some runs inside, but not a
lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``On third down they brought in a lot of defensive backs and
blitzed us. We picked a lot of it up. But at times, we didn't. They
have a terrific defense, one of the best we've played against.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite not driving his team to a touchdown, Patriots
quarterback Drew Bledsoe received a compliment from Miami defensive
lineman Trace Armstrong. ``For playing with some guys (receivers
Tony Simmons and Anthony Ladd) who just walked off the street, Drew
was pretty good,'' Armstrong said. ``We got good pressure on him,
but the times we didn't get there he made the big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' big offensive weapon was Shawn Jefferson. He made
almost all of the big plays New England had. Terrell Buckley tried
to cover him most of the day man-to-man, but when the blitz
couldn't get to Bledsoe and Jefferson got into a foot race deep
with Buckley, the defender was overmatched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buckley had the toughest job on the field for us today,'' said
Thomas. ``He had to take Jefferson, and that is not easy. Most of
the game we didn't make that many mistakes, but when we did,
Jefferson hit us with some big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins knew they had escaped a long season. ``Now we are
in the divisional race,'' said Ruddy. ``It's wide open. Any team
can get it now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had a chance to open ground on their top contender
and couldn't.

BC'S SEASON BARELY AFLOAT 
</HEADLINE>
 COLLEGE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There were many inconsolable figures in Boston
College's locker room after Saturday's stunning 32-31 loss against
Navy at Alumni Stadium, but there were a handful of players who
were tormented in particular by the lament, ``If only ...''
</P>
<P>
   If only Mike Cloud had not stepped out of bounds at the BC 23,
the senior running back might have gone 84 yards instead of 7, and
had a game-breaking touchdown on his 22d carry. If only Anthony
DiCosmo had held onto the ball after making a diving effort in the
end zone in the fourth quarter ... quarterback Scott Mutryn had not
fumbled at the BC 29 with 1:31 to go ... or, most important, John
Matich had not missed a 40-yard field goal attempt wide left as
time expired, then there might not have been as much grief or
regret in BC's locker room after the Eagles squandered a 28-10
fourth-quarter lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there was any one person who was at fault for
the loss,'' said Cloud, who broke the 1,000-yard mark for the
season by rushing 29 times for 186 yards, including TDs of 35 and
12 yards. ``We win as a team and we lose as a team. It's no one
person's fault. Basically, the guys who didn't make plays when they
should have, they've just got to keep their heads up. Then the next
four games we need to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the next four games _ beginning with a tough
conference road trip to Miami Saturday _ are the remainder of BC's
season. The Eagles (3-4 overall, 2-2 conference) also play vs.
Notre Dame Nov. 7 and back-to-back conference games at Pittsburgh
Nov. 14 and West Virginia Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles have to overcome not only the pain of squandering a
610-yard, 31-point offensive effort, but the mounting injuries of a
defense that lost yet another starter when sixth-year linebacker
Brian Maye went down with a strained right groin.
</P>
<P>
   Maye, who is expected to undergo X-rays Monday, remains
uncertain for Saturday, as does junior safety Pedro Cirino, who
missed his second game with a left shoulder burner. In a 42-25 loss
to Syracuse, sophomore cornerback D.J. Sutton suffered a
season-ending injury when he tore the anterior cruciate ligament of
his right knee, leaving BC without two starters in its secondary
against Navy.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles' pass coverage was exploited by Navy when quarterback
Brian Broadwater fired a 78-yard pass to Ryan Read to cut BC's lead
to 28-25. After Matich converted a 43-yard field goal to give BC a
31-25 lead, Ronel Reyes, a senior wideout who had never touched the
ball in his career, caught a lateral from Broadwater and then fired
the ball 48 yards downfield to Jason Wolf, setting up a go-ahead
8-yard TD run by John Vereen.
</P>
<P>
   ``First one, that was just an option fake, and we shouldn't have
been (beaten) on the situation,'' BC coach Tom O'Brien said when
asked about the two breakdowns. ``The second one was a double pass,
a throwback pass, and I think we sucked up with the safety (Carlos
Moore) and (Wolf) got behind him, so I can understand that one a
little more than I can the first one.''
</P>
<P>
   But what was not understandable was how BC, in dire need of a
victory to snap out of its 0-fer October skein, allowed an apparent
triumph to slip away. Now the Eagles face Miami, which escaped West
Virginia with a 34-31 victory Saturday after Jay Taylor missed a
53-yard field goal attempt _ wide left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a must win for this team,'' Cloud said of the Navy
game. ``We wanted to come out strong for the second half of the
season. We were expected to win. The only thing we learn from this
is to never give up. We can never give up in a game, and we have to
play for 60 minutes like Navy did.''

RAVE REVIEW FOR WEEKEND DRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Sometimes college football has highlight-film
weekends, when games all over the country are so dramatic, so
pulsating, that not even ``SportsCenter'' can keep up with the
pace.
</P>
<P>
   Take Saturday, for example. Start in the East, where Navy came
up with a remarkable fourth-quarter comeback to beat Boston
College, 32-31, in a game that was not decided until the Eagles'
field goal attempt went wide left on the last play.
</P>
<P>
   Go south to Providence, where Brown beat Penn in a
can-you-believe-it 58-51 game that didn't require overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Move to the Midwest, where Notre Dame needed a last-second field
goal to beat Army, and where Nebraska, playing at home, had to come
from behind in the fourth quarter to beat Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Or to the West, where Arizona State and Stanford had staged a
classic Thursday night with a 44-38 Sun Devil overtime win.
Saturday there was Washington's remarkable 35-34 triumph over
Oregon State, which wasn't settled until a 2-point conversion
attempt by the Beavers failed as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   Why not kick the extra point and try overtime? Oregon State
coach Mike Riley, who is attempting to guide the Beavers to their
first winning season in 27 years, explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to end the game right there, and I thought we
could,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the doings in the South, where Georgia outscored
Kentucky, 28-26, in a game that was not decided until a 49-yard
field goal attempt by the Wildcats never materialized because of a
botched snap.
</P>
<P>
   The most remarkable game probably was Penn-Brown. With the
implementation of the overtime rule several years ago, some wild
scores have been posted. But a 51-51 tie in the final seconds of
regulation is worthy of note.
</P>
<P>
   Nine lead changes, three ties, and a final-play 24-yard TD pass
from James Perry to Stephen Campbell characterized a contest that
had more back and forth than some basketball games. In the final
nine minutes alone there were 43 points scored, with six lead
changes or ties; the teams scored 58 points in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three points in nine minutes? Fifty-eight points in the
last quarter? Brown's basketball team has had trouble scoring 43
points in 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Penn coach Al Bagnoli summed it up best. ``If you told me we
were going to score 51 points and lose, I would say you're crazy,''
he said. ``In my 16 years of coaching, I never had been involved in
a game like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor had anyone else in the Ivy League. In the conference's
history, no teams had scored more points.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a little more than a month remaining in the regular season,
Texas running back  &UR; Ricky Williams  &LR; is starting to make his move
for the Heisman Trophy. Not only did Williams score two touchdowns
in the last two minutes to give Texas a 30-20 win over Baylor
Saturday, but he picked up 259 yards rushing on 39 carries for the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is now the career scoring leader in Division
</P>
<P>
   1-A history with 428 points, and also is closing in on  &UR; Tony
Dorsett's  &LR; career rushing yardage record of 6,082. With 5,639
career yards and four games remaining, Williams has a legitimate
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky Williams is the best player in the country,'' said Texas
coach  &UR; Mack Brown &LR; . ``People who don't know that haven't seen him
play.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Missouri-Nebraska game ended in dramatic fashion,
with the Huskers scoring a last-second touchdown to force an
overtime in a contest they eventually won.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, when the teams met again in Lincoln, Neb., there was
more drama, as the Huskers came from behind for a 20-13 victory
that came down to the last play _ and again Missouri was
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback  &UR; Corby Jones  &LR; got his team to the Nebraska 22-yard
line with nine seconds left before seeing his dream of tying or
beating the Huskers end with an incomplete pass in the end zone
(through wide receiver  &UR; John Dausman's  &LR; hands) and a sack.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M coach  &UR; R.C. Slocum  &LR; is getting downright liberal in
his coaching these days. A week ago, the Aggies scored on a reverse
and a halfback option pass. In Saturday's 17-10 win over Texas
Tech, they scored on a fake field goal. A&AMP;M snapped a three-game
losing streak against the Red Raiders, who had won those meetings
by a combined total of 13 points ... Things went from bad to worse
in South Carolina, where Clemson lost to Duke and South Carolina
lost to Vanderbilt. Clemson coach  &UR; Tommy West  &LR; and South Carolina
coach  &UR; Brad Scott  &LR; should be put on the endangered species list ...
Florida State quarterback  &UR; Chris Weinke  &LR; is on a great passing run,
throwing 175 without an interception, dating back to his six-pick
debacle in the Seminoles' loss to North Carolina State in September
... Bad news for Virginia. Although the Cavaliers bounced back from
last week's loss to Georgia Tech with a win over North Carolina
State, safety  &UR; Anthony Poindexter &LR; , &UR;  &LR; arguably the best defensive
back in college football, went down with a severely sprained left
knee that could sideline him indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State should be on cruise control until the Michigan game.
With Indiana, Michigan State, and Iowa its next three foes, the No.
1-ranked Buckeyes don't have a ranked team remaining on their
schedule ... Auburn posted an emotional 32-17 win over Louisiana
Tech, playing the game only a day after its coach,  &UR; Terry
Bowden &LR; , &UR;  &LR; announced his resignation. The Auburn players reacted in
different, but predictable, ways. ``I gave this win to Coach
Bowden,'' said Auburn tailback  &UR; Michael Burks &LR; . But defensive end
 &UR; Leonardo Carson  &LR; felt differently. ``Coach Bowden chickened out
and let us down,'' he said. ``We were out there fighting for him
and he left us. Everybody felt like he stabbed us in the back.''

PASSING IN THEIR PRIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Old quarterbacks never die, they just go the fade route.
</P>
<P>
   And they're going reluctantly. They have learned to renounce red
meat in order to revive their salad days. They now realize lifting
weights will not make them go blind. They have cut way back on
howling at the moon. They are fit and have decided to continue
accepting the prevailing wage for professional quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   They will have to be dragged kicking, screaming and audibilizing
into the broadcast booth. Their surrender will require conclusive
proof that they no longer can thrive in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   We offer no such proof.
</P>
<P>
   We do offer a roll call: Marino (37), Elway (38), Testaverde
(34.9), Moon (41), Cunningham (35), Flutie (36 _ please, hold your
applause until we're finished), Steve Young (37) and Steve ``Ice
Age'' DeBerg, the 44-magma of the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   We are on their side. We are delivering their message: in 35
games started by QBs with 35 or more birthdays in the bank
(including the almost-35 Testaverde), 28 have resulted in victory.
Four of the six division-leading teams have offenses directed by
one of the aforementioned QBs.
</P>
<P>
   This tells us that old quarterbacks are, to make them sound more
contemporary, the bomb. It also tells us that old quarterbacks are
fortunate enough to play with other good players, and that the
young toughs of quarterbacking must deal with the curse of being
drafted early by teams that are two-deep in lousy players.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond any shaky variables, we will pay tribute to the relics,
guys who are savvy enough to have an answering machine in the ol'
helmet phone for those times when the offensive coordinator dials
up a play that would have made Nixon blush. Pressure-immune guys
who treat the two-minute drill like a grudge game of fetch with the
family dog. Guys who entered the league at a time when ``roughing
the passer'' was loosely interpreted, a time when the sideline
medical staff had to rotate the tires on the stadium gurney.
</P>
<P>
   Guys who no longer are blamed for having ``potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Would you have your vasectomy performed by a doctor with
``potential''?
</P>
<P>
   Face it, kiddie quarterbacks need time to adjust. Time to
realize Cliff Notes are no substitute for reading defenses. Time to
learn that Y.A. Tittle is not an investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   Time to respect their quarterbacking elders without letting them
behind the wheel of a car.

RUCCHIN TIES THINGS UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It was hard to say what was more painful for
the 16,133 fans at the Pond to watch on Sunday evening _ the Mighty
Ducks' struggling for 40 minutes against Phoenix, or Steve
Rucchin's continuing struggle to score a goal.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Ducks got started just in time to salvage a 2-2
tie versus the Coyotes, earning the point on Rucchin's goal with
4:38 left in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Rucchin, who led Anaheim with seven shots, finally got goal No.1
of the season on a rebound shot from the slot just before he was
cleaned out by Phoenix defenseman Teppo Numminen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was putting his nose in there tonight,'' said Paul Kariya.
``Naturally (you press on) when you are getting chances and not
scoring. But it's amazing what one goal will do for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Rucchin, a notoriously slow starter, had a smile on his face
after finally finding the net with one of the numerous scoring
chances he's had this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the worst chances of the night,'' said
Rucchin, who earlier in the game couldn't convert a pass from Teemu
Selanne at the side of a wide-open Phoenix net. ``It's kind of
funny how the one you don't think is going to go in goes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will definitely be good for my confidence. Hopefully it
will take some pressure off me. I know I need to pick up my
offense, but I know it will come.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg will continue to pressure
Rucchin and the rest of the Ducks, even though the team is unbeaten
in its last three games (2-0-1).
</P>
<P>
   ``We played good for 20 minutes and got one point,'' he said.
``But 20 minutes in this league is not good enough to get a win. In
the first two periods we just didn't work hard enough. We have to
keep learning.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anaheim nearly did pull out the win. Travis Green had
Nikolai Khabibulin down and out with less than four minutes left
but couldn't lift the puck over him into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Tverdovsky got things started for the Coyotes early,
scoring 51 seconds into the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya, who assisted on both Anaheim goals after being held
without a shot in the first two periods, sensed something was wrong
even before the game started.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a horrible warmup and they caught us right away,'' he
said. ``Finally we woke up in the third period.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Ducks, they got strong performances from Guy
Hebert _ who made 34 saves _ and the penalty-killing unit, which
killed off a 1-minute, 24-second two-man disadvantage in the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a good job of staying close,'' said Hebert. ``We aren't
happy with the tie, but we showed some character.''
</P>
<P>
   After being held in check for nearly 50 minutes, Kariya and
Selanne, aided by Tomas Sandstrom along the boards, got the Ducks
within a goal. Phoenix's Bob Corkum couldn't knock down Kariya's
lead pass to Selanne and the Anaheim winger ripped his third goal
of the season past Khabibulin at 8:22.
</P>
<P>
   Seven minutes later the Phoenix goalie turned aside shots by
Kariya and Selanne, but Rucchin was there for the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously that was a huge goal,'' said Hartsburg. ``That line
was dominant in the third period because they outworked whomever
they played against.''
</P>
<P>
   Just under four minutes into the second period, Phoenix took a
2-0 lead. Jyrki Lumme drove around the Aanheim defense and set up a
tap-in goal for Keith Tkachuk, who had beaten Tomas Sandstrom to
the front of the net.
</P>
<P>
   With a two-goal advantage, the Coyotes went to work on slowing
the game to a snail's pace _ and they were successful until midway
through the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim had only two shots in the first 13 minutes of the second
period and Phoenix neutralized both Kariya and Selanne. Kariya
didn't record his first shot on goal until the 19:12 mark of the
third period, a 120-footer as the Ducks were going for a line
change.

HOUSTON GROUNDS NORTH TEXAS, 31-9
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ Darrell Dickey's strides were quick and compact,
his frustration obvious as he walked from Fouts Field last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pretty,'' Dickey said, sarcasm dripping with each
syllable.
</P>
<P>
   The North Texas coach had seen his team turn what at times had
looked like a very winnable game into a 31-9 loss to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   His team controlled second-quarter action, running 28 plays
compared with three for Houston, gaining 112 yards compared with 3
for Houston and getting inside the 25-yard line three times
compared with no red-zone penetrations for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   For this, UNT entered halftime with a 9-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three times we get down there and all we get are field
goals,'' Eagles offensive lineman Vinny Patterson said. ``That's
frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, UNT kicker Garrett Courtney finished all three drives
and accounted for all of UNT's points with two 28-yard field goals
and a 40-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   Given a second chance, Houston proceeded to pummel UNT with a
second-half barrage of draw plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just weren't executing,'' Eagles safety Ramone Archie said.
``We knew what they were going to run. They ran the same play, the
draw play, every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston (2-5) rushed for 220 yards, with 165 coming in second
half. Corsicana's Ketric Sanford led all rushers with 108 yards,
including a 10-yard touchdown, on 22 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Houston handled all second-half scoring, including the first
non-special teams points with 2:23 remaining in the third quarter.
It was a 19-yard touchdown pass from Cougars quarterback Jason
McKinley to Jerrian James.
</P>
<P>
   McKinley added an 8-yard touchdown to Orlando Iglesias 23
seconds into fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Detrion Woodson, the defensive back on the play, spiked the
ball, kicked the pylon and screamed at the referee because he
thought Iglesias had pushed off. Woodson was ejected from the game.
</P>
<P>
   UNT finished with three personal fouls and a late hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the game, we lost our composure,'' Dickey said.
``We need to come back the next play and correct it as opposed to
after the play.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Archie: ``We felt like the refs didn't help us, but they
weren't a 31-point difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston had taken advantage of its limited second-quarter play,
taking 20 seconds from the time Courtney kicked off after his
second field goal until Mike Smith crossed the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Smith went 92 yards for a touchdown that erased a six-point lead
that had taken UNT two long series and two field goals to create.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney's final field goal, which allowed the Eagles to head
into halftime with a lead, looked like a kindergarten fire drill.
</P>
<P>
   A low, wobbly snap came flying back with two seconds remaining,
and Courtney pushed it through as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to finish up when we get stuck,'' Courtney said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston finished plays while UNT failed to, and player after
player said that's why UNT lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a step backwards. It's a building block,'' Patterson
said. ``We're going to use this. It's going to make us hungrier for
Idaho.'' Extra points Houston's Jeremy Maxon was taken from the
field on a stretcher in the third quarter. He went to a hospital,
where X-rays taken on his neck showed no fracture. He was expected
to travel back to Houston with the team. ... UNT freshman wideout
Clint Bartel had a family reunion of sorts last night. His father,
Gary Bartel, is defensive coordinator for Houston. ... Courtney has
22 field goals in 17 games since coming to UNT. He has jumped to
No. 5 in field goals made for UNT.

VETERAN DEFENSEMAN BODGER HITS MILESTONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Perhaps the greatest testament to Los
Angeles Kings defenseman Doug Bodger is that he outlasted Mario
Lemieux.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the Pittsburgh Penguins chose Lemieux with the first
overall pick in the NHL draft, then chose Bodger with the ninth
pick. When Lemieux scored a goal on his first shift in his first
NHL game, against the Boston Bruins, Bodger handed him the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux retired after the 1996-97 season. Bodger on Sunday
became the 129th player in NHL history to appear in 1,000 games as
the Kings beat the Carolina Hurricanes 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's a big accomplishment,'' said Bodger, who is at
the start of his 15th NHL season. ``Ever since I got above 800, I
thought, `Gee, I might just make it.' I've been lucky and stayed
free of injuries. I'm pretty excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodger, 32, clearly remembers Lemieux's first goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did nothing in training camp and was looked at as kind of a
lazy guy in camp,'' recalled Bodger, acquired by the Kings from New
Jersey over the summer. ``The first game, he skated around Ray
Bourque and put the puck past (goalie) Pete Peeters. I thought,
`Gee, this guy is pretty good.' &UR;  &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Join the club: Three other Kings have a chance to reach the
1,000-game mark this season. Winger Russ Courtnall has appeared in
979 games, defenseman Garry Galley has appeared in 965 and center
Ray Ferraro has appeared in 960.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL record for games played is held by Gordie Howe, who
appeared in 1,767 games during his 26-year NHL career.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Odd man out: Galley got in the lineup for only the second
time this season, but played just four shifts, none in the third
period. Coach Larry Robinson even used Galley, 35, on a wing for
one shift, a position he had played only a couple of times very
early in his 15-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing about as much then as I am now, so that tells
you something,'' an obviously disappointed Galley said, referring
to his stint on the wing a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson dressed seven defensemen and benched winger Craig
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt C.J. hasn't been the player we want him to be,''
Robinson said. ``He has to get involved and use his speed, cut to
the net and use his body.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Loose pucks: Trainer Pete Demers said goalie Stephane Fiset
(groin strain) should be ready to play Tuesday when the Kings visit
the New York Islanders. Winger Josh Green (shoulder strain) also
should be available, but center Jozef Stumpel (hip-flexor strain)
is questionable.... Mighty Ducks vice president Jack Ferreira
scouted the game.... General Manager Dave Taylor, who has been
scouting junior teams in Canada, is scheduled to join the Kings in
New York.

TORTURE VICTIMS FIND A WAY TO FIGHT BACK IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   By LOUIS FREEDBERG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ Gerald Gray, a therapist who has long worked with
torture victims, clearly remembers the day when a Bosnian refugee
he was treating recognized his torturer on the streets of San
Francisco.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Terrified, the man broke off treatment immediately, and he fled
the Bay Area. ``It was too upsetting, and he felt endangered,''
said Gray, who learned that it is common for victims of human
rights abuses who are in the United States to run into the people
who committed them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``It has been an open secret that the torturers and the
murderers are here, but they are not being reported either to the
authorities or to human rights groups.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Amnesty International, he founded the only
organization in the United States devoted exclusively to helping
victims of torture and other atrocities file civil suits in U.S.
courts against perpetrators of those crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-month-old Center for Justice and Accountability, housed in
a suite of offices in downtown San Francisco, is part of a small
but growing movement intended to send a message that those who
commit ``crimes against humanity'' will not find a ``safe haven''
in the United States or any other country.
</P>
<P>
   The movement's most dramatic success came last week when a
Spanish judge ordered the extradition and arrest of former Chilean
dictator Augusto Pinochet, on charges of genocide, terrorism and
torture during his 17-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   Gray estimates that since the Vietnam War, thousands of
violators of human rights have sought safe haven in the United
States, where they have gone undetected because their victims are
afraid to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the fledgling organization filed its first suit, on
behalf of Kemal Mehinovic, a Bosnian Muslim refugee living in Salt
Lake City. The suit charges that Nikola Vuckovic, a Serb now living
in Atlanta, personally detained Muslims, ransacked their homes and
participated in torture and beatings.
</P>
<P>
   According to the suit, Vuckovic beat Mehinovic ``with metal
pipes, baseball bats, chair legs, wooden batons, his flats and
heavy boots, and at one point forced his legs apart and beat his
genitals, stating ``You won't be needing this anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray said that few refugees know that a U.S. law as old as the
nation itself allows them to seek damages against the people who
victimized them or their families in another country.
</P>
<P>
   The Alien Torts Act, passed in 1789 by the first Congress, says
that foreigners can sue if they are victims of crimes committed
``in violation of the law of nations.'' The law was in part
intended to allow victims of ocean piracy to go after their
assailants once they arrived in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Congress reaffirmed the concept of holding human rights
abusers accountable for their actions by approving the Torture
Victim Protection Act. The law eliminated a quirk in the law by
allowing U.S. citizens as well as foreigners to file suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress made clear that anyone, not just aliens, could bring
suit against people who committed these acts,'' said Ralph
Steinhardt, a law professor at George Washington University and
board chairman of the Center For Justice and Accountability.
</P>
<P>
   So far, approximately 35 suits have been filed against human
rights violators in U.S. courts, including former Philippine
dictator Ferdinand Marcos when he was living in exile in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The victims have come from virtually every country that has
experienced violent civil conflicts, including Argentina,
Guatemala, Paraguay, Haiti, Ethiopia and Indonesia. In almost all
cases, the plaintiffs have won substantial damages _ but hardly any
have collected any money. In the Marcos case, lawyers for the
plaintiffs are still negotiating with his wife, Imelda, for
resolution of the 1996 award of $2 billion on behalf of 10,000
victims of the Philippine strongman's rule.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to track down violators of human rights received a
big boost with the establishment of the International War Crimes
Tribunal in 1994 to prosecute atrocities committed during the
genocidal wars in Bosnia and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal signalled a new willingness on the part of the
international community to respond to allegations of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   But because governments have in general been loathe to use their
powers to apprehend those accused of atrocities, experts say that
the burden will increasingly fall on individuals and
nongovernmental organizations like Gray's to take action on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``A state is generally reluctant to take on these high-level
political actions when they have relations with a foreign
country,'' said Jonathan Charney, a professor at Vanderbilt Law
School and editor of the American Journal of International Law.
</P>
<P>
   Charney said that it is for this reason that victims of
atrocities are seeking redress on their own without waiting for
governments to act. ``We see the rising importance of individuals
and nongovernment organizations engaging in actions that states are
reluctant to take,'' he said.

FONG HITS BOXER, DEFENDS SHELDON DONATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN WILDERMUTH  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ With his poll numbers eroding, Republican Senate
candidate Matt Fong launched a weekend assault on incumbent
Democrat Barbara Boxer, but also found himself defending a $50,000
donation to the anti-gay Traditional Values Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Fong acknowledged making the ``charitable donation'' last spring
using funds left over from his 1994 campaign for state treasurer.
But he said it was intended to help change that group's more
extreme positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What lets me be a unifier and not a divider is my ability to
work with different groups, even with those who would be considered
extreme by some people,'' Fong said.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange County coalition and its founder, the Rev. Lou
Sheldon, are opposed to abortion and family planning and have
called for quarantining people with AIDS to stop the spread of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon also led the successful effort to persuade Republican
Senate leaders to torpedo the nomination of James Hormel, a gay San
Francisco businessman and philanthropist, as ambassador to
Luxembourg. The minister accused Hormel of working to spread an
``immoral homosexual agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   With just eight days remaining in the hard fought race, Fong had
hoped to portray Boxer as too divisive and too liberal to be
effective in the Senate. But the revelations about Fong's financial
ties to Sheldon underscored the difficulty he is having countering
charges that he is too extreme for California.
</P>
<P>
   Fong said his donation was earmarked for a poll leading toward
an initiative that would ban same-sex marriages in California, an
effort Fong supports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lou Sheldon is an old friend, although I disagree with him on
many issues,'' Fong said. ``When I was assured that it would only
be used for defense of traditional marriage, I gave him the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Boxer criticized Fong's explanation. ``This is
just another confirmation of what we have been seeing all along,''
said Roy Behr. ``Matt Fong is not a moderate. He is a supporter of
extremists who are opposed to allowing personal freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Behr also dismissed Fong's contention that he wants to work with
a variety of groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using that logic, I imagine he'll be giving a $50,000
contribution to the ACLU any day now.''
</P>
<P>
   The donation uproar came as Fong unleashed a weekend offensive
against Boxer, characterizing her as an out-of-touch radical whose
re-election would threaten California and the nation. With new
polls showing Boxer edging into the lead, Fong lashed out at Boxer
with a personal bitterness new to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The November 3 election ``is a referendum on (Boxer's)
extremism, divisiveness and hypocrisy,'' Fong told supporters at a
Del Mar fund-raiser yesterday. ``She is a left-wing radical with a
resume ... laced with examples of her appealing to the lowest
common denominator with fear, distortion and half-truths. It is a
resume lacking in leadership, principle and effectiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's votes have weakened the national defense, hurt public
education, coddled criminals and harmed working families and
seniors by raising taxes, Fong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After six years in the Senate, the best she can do is say,
`Matt Fong is a nasty guy,' not talk about her own record,'' Fong
said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the credit for Boxer's rise in poll numbers can be
attributed to the Democrat's multimillion dollar television
campaign, which has been hammering Fong relentlessly for his
conservative stands on environmental regulation, gun control and
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations about Fong's relationship with Sheldon appear to
give Boxer another boost, but Fong sought to play that down
yesterday as he campaigned in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``People gave me money because they support my values,'' Fong
said. ``I've said all along that I support traditional marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong's $50,000 donation came from money raised over the past
four years for his anticipated re-election campaign for state
treasurer. Because of stricter federal campaign laws, money raised
for his state race could not be transferred to his federal Senate
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Fong also gave $25,000 from his state campaign account to the
nonpartisan Southwest Voters Project for voter education and
another $25,000 to a group backing a proposed initiative that would
require parental consent before a minor could receive an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Fong has been criticized in recent months because many of the
most generous contributors to his state campaign account were
developers, lawyers and others with applications pending before the
Tax Credit Allocation Committee, which Fong chairs.
</P>
<P>
   While Fong still has more than $560,000 in his state re-election
fund, he said he has not decided how he will use the rest of the
money.

   CRUSO, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Without the wooden sign, few people who stop at milepost 420 on
the Blue Ridge Parkway would know the massive peak in the distance
is Cold Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the mountain has been little more than a backdrop
for vacation photographs.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, a Civil War soldier's walk home to his beloved
Ada in Charles Frazier's novel ``Cold Mountain'' captured the
hearts of America's readers.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the book has stayed on the nation's best-seller
lists _ and things have changed at the parkway pullover near Wagon
Road Gap.
</P>
<P>
   Vacationers scramble to position themselves so Cold Mountain and
the wooden sign are visible in the photographs they take home to
friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers at the U.S. Forest Service headquarters near Brevard say
their phones are busy with calls from people who want to know how
to find Cold Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic pullover is the closest most of the people will get
to the 6,030-foot peak that stands deep in a remote section of
Pisgah National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Only one trail leads to the top of the mountain. Until now, few
hikers have ventured out on the trek.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Nicholson, who works with the Forest Service and has roamed
the mountains in the area for more than 40 years, said only
experienced hikers should try the journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, it's hard to get there,'' Nicholson said. ``The last
few miles you have to walk through thick woods; the trail runs out,
and it's easy to go the wrong direction. You could get lost on the
way to Cold Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the 14-mile walk on steep terrain, hikers also face the
possibility of an encounter with a black bear or a timber
rattlesnake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before that book, nobody thought much about Cold Mountain,''
Nicholson said. ``Now, everybody's trying to find it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cold Mountain sits north of the parkway, near Waynesville.
Highway 276, which runs roughly along the path of Wagon Road Gap
and was talked about in Frazier's book, winds down from the north
off the parkway and along the east side of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Highway 215, on the western side of the peak, meets Highway 276
near Cruso. Drivers using both roads can complete a 50-mile
circuitous route around the peak. The roads pass lush pastures,
thriving vegetable gardens and the coves, creeks and country
churches mentioned in Frazier's book.
</P>
<P>
   For a person standing in the silence of a Cold Mountain church
yard, it takes only a speck of imagination to hear people inside
lift their voices with ``Angel Band.'' The song, a hymn the
congregations sing in Frazier's book, has endured. A few years ago,
``Angel Band'' became the title cut on an Emmylou Harris album of
gospel music.
</P>
<P>
   There is no town called Cold Mountain, but the people whose
houses are on the ridges and in the coves at the mountain's lowest
levels refer to ``Cold Mountain'' as their home.
</P>
<P>
   Most residents of the area say they have read Frazier's book
based on the life of W.P. Inman, and they liked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read the book and listened to the tape two or three
times,'' said Bill Thompson, 68, a regular at Frank's Store in
Cruso. ``If he didn't tell you what mountain he was talking about,
I could tell from the descriptions it was Cold Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and his friend Van Revis, 67, recall the times in their
childhood when they camped and picked blueberries on the mountain.
When an Army airplane crashed on Cold Mountain in 1945, Revis was
the first person to reach the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time I was up on the Cold Mountain was in 1987, when they
came in here and took the engines off the mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   While many people at Frank's claim they know a lot about the
area, they send visitors who want a tour to Roy Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin's family has called this part of North Carolina home
since his father, Elbert Griffin, set out on his own at 12 years
old from the Cherokee Indian Reservation and settled in Smoky Cove.
That was in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to know something about Cold Mountain?'' Griffin said
as he walked across the hay field he had just mowed. ``Then, you've
come to the right place.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin is 63 and loves taking people on a tour. The retired
paper mill worker has hunted black bear on Cold Mountain for more
than 50 years. Last year, he killed 10 bears and has the meat in
his freezer to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Like the farmers in Frazier's book, Griffin grazes cattle on the
mountain' high meadows. His pasture wraps around the hillside
behind his home in Smoky Cove.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I die, they're going to bury me up there where my cattle
can graze over my grave and I can see Cold Mountain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin is in a small fraternity, those who have actually been
on the mountain, instead of just viewing it from below. ``Few
people ever stood at the top of that mountain and seen that
360-degree view,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To get there, he travels by four-wheeler halfway up the mountain
on a washed out road. From there, he begins hiking cross-country to
reach the summit. ``At the top, the rhododendron is so thick you
have to crawl in places,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While he doesn't mind being the unofficial tour guide of Cold
Mountain, not everyone who comes inquiring is welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real estate people are about to drive us crazy up here,''
Griffin said. ``All of 'em trying to find property they can buy for
somebody on Cold Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Locals at Frank's say no one living near there knows more than
Griffin about Cold Mountain's history. It is from this position
that he judges the job Frazier did writing his first novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``That old boy did a good job,'' Griffin said. ``You can tell he
researched it real good. He got the names of the creeks and coves
right. You could tell he'd been here by the way he described 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier, who lives in Raleigh, grew up in Haywood County, N.C.
He raises horses on a farm in eastern North Carolina, five hours
from the mountain. During much of the time he was writing ``Cold
Mountain,'' Frazier lived in a friend's house in western North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still plenty of Cold Mountain stories left to
tell, and there is another writer waiting in the wings to tell
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you this,'' said Griffin's son Lesley. ``That boy
that wrote the book on Cold Mountain can move over, cause he's got
company. I'm writing one, too.''

   In the upcoming impeachment inquiry, many lawmakers on Capitol
Hill will be sharply critical of what they call Bill Clinton's
coercive style. Did he put undue pressure on his secretary Betty
Curry, Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and others to do or say
things which would be favorable to himself?
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians would probably concede that some ``arm
twisting'' is ultimately necessary to accomplish their agendas. But
there is a limit to just how much power a leader like President
Clinton can exert on others before it backfires.
</P>
<P>
   How shrewd would you be in a position of power like that of
Clinton? The quiz ahead gauges your ``Machiavellian index,'' the
degree to which you might use or misuse authority entrusted to you.
</P>
<P>
   Answer yes or no to the questions below. Granting that the
statements can't cover all possible variations of a situation,
indicate whether you agree or disagree with each item. Be honest!
</P>
<P>
   1. It is best to tell a white lie to avoid hassles.
</P>
<P>
   2. It is probably wise to flatter important people who are in a
position to help you.
</P>
<P>
   3. All in all, it's better to be humble and honest than
important and dishonest.
</P>
<P>
   4. In this tough, competitive world, most anything short of
being unethical is justified in getting ahead.
</P>
<P>
   5. Most successful people lead clean, honest lives.
</P>
<P>
   6. P.T. Barnum was right when he said there's a sucker born
every minute.
</P>
<P>
   7. It is virtually impossible to succeed in politics without
being dishonest.
</P>
<P>
   8. As a youngster, you often got your way by bluffing, bullying
or using physical force.
</P>
<P>
   9. The biggest difference between law violators and others is
that the violators are not smart enough to avoid being caught.
</P>
<P>
   l0. Don't tell anyone the real reason for doing something unless
it is useful to do so.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Key &LR; :
</P>

more than willing to entertain another person's viewpoint. You are
a harmonizer and, at times, may even be too relaxed in carrying
through on your own programs and goals.
</P>
<P>
   Four to 6 points: You are average when it comes to exerting your
power motives over others. You are likely to push your ideas
moderately but not to the point of overruling or manipulating
others.
</P>
<P>
   Seven or more points: You do not share traditional notions about
morality and governing others. You are an independent thinker who
dislikes conforming to your peers. You are cool and at times even
distant. You might sometimes treat others as objects to be
manipulated.

<P>
   A diplomat who was every inch the dignified official was about
to give a speech at a reception. When he stood up, he glanced down
and saw with horror that his fly was unzipped.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly sat down and yanked the zipper shut but trapped his
tie in the zipper's unforgiving teeth.
</P>
<P>
   As he rose to his feet again, the tie drew round his neck like a
noose, choking off his breath.
</P>
<P>
   In the end someone had to cut the cravat in half with scissors,
while every pair of eyes in the room looked on. The flustered
diplomat ran from the room with one piece of necktie flapping from
his trousers and the other dangling from his collar.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassment lurks somewhere in the lives of all of us. An
after-dinner speaker loses his place in his text and you and
everyone else in the audience has a good laugh. Then you go home to
discover a bright green piece of salad stuck between your teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the source, embarrassment can stop its victims dead in
their tracks, according to Edward Gross, author of ``Embarrassment
in Everyday Life'' (Etc. Publications, 1994). Gross became
interested in the topic more than two decades ago when he taught at
a small college headed by an incompetent president. Layers of staff
surrounded and insulated the top person, performing functions for
him. When Gross asked why the school did not seek a capable
president, the staff and board of directors replied it would be too
embarrassing for all concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of evolution, people suffer _ and have always
suffered _ embarrassment, because it is a gigantic clue to stop and
repair some damage,'' explains Gross. He and other experts who have
taken a close look at mortifying moments say four conditions must
exist at once before you truly suffer the hot flush of
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   First, there must be a failure for which you feel responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the failure must occur suddenly, with no time to prepare
or adjust.
</P>
<P>
   Third, ``it must take place in public,'' says Dr. Domeena
Renshaw, a professor of psychiatry at Loyola University in Chicago.
``Reddened faces result because shock instantly increases your
blood pressure so more blood can travel to the brain to help you
figure a way out of the predicament in which you just put
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   And fourth, the witnesses must be persons whose opinion you
value.
</P>
<P>
   Beware, however, of the person who can't be embarrassed. That
rare individual feels above the fray and may consider his position,
intelligence and status so lofty he doesn't care what others think.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the best way to deal with an embarrassing moment is
with a snappy riposte. When the British conductor Sir Thomas
Beecham was rehearsing his orchestra, he called out that the third
flute was too loud. Somebody replied that the third flute had not
arrived yet. Sir Thomas shot back: ``Well, tell him when he gets
here!''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say if the slip is a minor one, just charge ahead like
it never happened. Actors do that all the time, and hardly anybody
notices. ``Whenever possible, thorough preparation will safeguard
you against embarrassing moments, Gross says. ``If you must
introduce somebody at a meeting, write down the names. If you are
to give a speech, go to the site beforehand and see for yourself if
there are any wires to trip on, that a lectern is provided and that
nothing else will take you unaware.''
</P>
<P>
   A tactic for minor botches is to claim the embarrassing misstep
was a rare misfortune: ``This is not the real me. I was tired or
sick or preoccupied when it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But how can you help someone else survive or escape the grief of
embarrassment? If you happen to spy your boss with sagging
pantyhose or you notice toilet paper trailing from the mayor's
shoe, you may feel ill at ease about breaking the news yourself.
Experts advise finding a person closer to the
soon-to-be-embarrassed person and suggest he fix the blooper before
it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research reveals that when people are embarrassed, they feel
like clods,'' Gross says. ``Their self-esteem has been wounded, and
they want to do something to restore it.''
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, a guest has knocked a glass of red wine onto
your beige carpet, you'll help him restore his image by offering
him a towel to assist in the cleaning. Try to move other guests
away from the mess and the source of the embarrassment. Then, make
light of it all by saying, ``You didn't get to finish your wine.
Can I get you a refill?''
</P>
<P>
   A fear of embarrassment sometimes can have significant, even
costly, consequences. To save face, people avoid asking for a
refund, replacement or better service. Most people think they would
be embarrassed because they would look like beggars.
</P>
<P>
   Gross says one way to deal with such situations is to change the
meaning of the request. Instead of thinking of yourself as a
beggar, change the meaning and think of it as giving the firm a
chance to improve its customer relations.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time you forget your place in a speech, forget your
boss's name while making introductions or find that piece of salad
in your teeth, remember to laugh it off, claim it wasn't the
``real'' you, or pretend it didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Your red face? You'll just have to put up with that. After all,
you're only human.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The wizards of Hollywood can create convincing jungle warfare on
a sound stage. Yet one small but significant aspect of moviemaking
is consistently overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is tone deaf to the songs of birds.
</P>
<P>
   A movie with all the right bird songs is as rare as a Kirtland's
warbler. No one seems to have told the moviemakers that birds have
geographic ranges (what's that Carolina wren doing in southern
California?); and that birds live in certain surroundings
(meadowlarks don't vocalize in towering forests).
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to concentrate on a story when ornithological
incongruities intrude. Compounding one's frustration is the sense
that not everyone in the audience cares.
</P>
<P>
   But would moviegoers sit still for a film about a New York City
whose streets were lined with coco palms?
</P>
<P>
   For the record, let me point out that misplaced bird songs fall
into six categories:
</P>
<P>
   1. Location. On movie soundtracks, I've heard eastern screech
owls and eastern bluebirds in California settings. In one ``lost on
a South Seas island'' movie, I kept hearing the scream of a
red-tailed hawk. Yet the red-tailed hawk is found in North America,
so either the castaways weren't really lost, or the bird was.
</P>
<P>
   2. Time of day. For some moviemakers, there is no distinction
between diurnal and nocturnal birds. A robin may burst into song at
midnight; an owl may hoot at high noon. If the mood will be
enhanced, they let the whip-poor-will call in bright sun, though it
raises its voice chiefly to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   3. Faux wilderness. The cry of the common loon gets a lot of
play in the movies. It is a sound I associate with wilderness _
large, pristine lakes where humans rarely intrude. In the movies,
however, you can hear a loon almost anywhere. The determining
factor is fog. A suburban scene with lawns, sidewalks and kids
riding bicycles is not good loon habitat, but add some fog and
Hollywood will have loons crying from every direction.
</P>
<P>
   4. Seasons. The scene in the television movie was cold and
dismal. Snow blanketed a twilight landscape crossed by split-rail
fences. A man and a woman embraced near the barn. Soon they were
serenaded by a hermit thrush, which many believe has the most
beautiful voice of all North American birds. The thrush sang on and
on, but all I could think of was that, in 25 years of listening to
birds, I've never heard a hermit thrush sing in winter.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut where I live, the song of the hermit thrush
echoes through deep woods in spring and summer only. So much for
willing suspension of disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   5. Unexplained silence. It's a beautiful spring morning on film.
The sun rises above the hilltops. Warm light streams over the
scene. Flowers are in bloom, trees are leafing out, the meadow is a
lush green, and the birds are ... mute. The actors populate a world
devoid of the wild melodies of seasonal renewal, and no one has
told the sound editor. It's Rachel Carson's ``Silent Spring'' come
true.
</P>
<P>
   6. Birdsong overkill. I once sat through a movie that used
birdsong to heighten suspense in a night scene. In quick succession
I heard several species of owls, chuck-will's-widow, whip-poor-will
and the omnipresent common loon. Not only did every nocturnal bird
of North America show up for a song in one place, but each species
sang on cue without stepping on another bird's lines.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the film I longed for the day when Hollywood
adds ``bird-song specialist'' to its roster of technical advisers.

THIS (HONORARY) BUCKEYE WISHES THE SENATOR WELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At age 77, my honorary senator, John Glenn of Ohio, is about to
become the oldest person in orbit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And those of us who are certified honorary Ohioans are nearly
overcome with something or other by this hyped-up moment. Woo-wee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, perhaps I shouldn't speak for other honorary Ohioans. The
truth is that since Ohio's lieutenant governor (whose name has slid
out of my memory bank) made me an honorary citizen of the Buckeye
State a year or two before Glenn became the first American in orbit
in 1962, I have lost touch with the other kids on my youth bus tour
who also became honorary citizens of Ohio that day in Columbus. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (I'm sort of proud of that last sentence. It lasted longer than
John Glenn's first space ride.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I am pretty sure that all those now-grown kids must be
as thrilled as I am about Ohio's senior senator being launched into
orbit this week aboard the space shuttle Discovery. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I haven't been this thrilled about something related to
Ohio since I rediscovered my honorary Ohio citizen card about two
years ago. Right after I found that card again I moved, which means
that the chances of my ever finding it again (or other large chunks
of my history) are almost nil. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But so what? I'm trustworthy. When I tell you I'm an honorary
citizen of Ohio you can take it to the bank. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Glenn turned 77 on July 18 this year, which means he is three
years younger to the day than President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela
of South Africa. Glenn's parents, however, did not have the moxie
to give their baby a middle name as eloquently ritzy as
Rolihlahla. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they stuck young Johnny with Herschel, which was also
his father John's middle name, making the baby a ``Jr.'' I suppose,
in retrospect, Herschel was a better choice than Clara, his
mother's name. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, just to put Glenn's life in complete perspective, not
only is he three years younger than Nelson Mandela, he's also
exactly 15 years older than the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile, which
first hit the streets on July 18, 1936, when the whole country
needed something at which to smile. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As far as I know, however, there are no plans to launch either
Nelson Mandela or the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile into space. Though,
to be frank, Washington has come up with worse ideas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The world certainly has changed since John Glenn got into the
space and speed business some decades ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1957 _ a year I spent out of the country and, thus, am not
responsible for _ Glenn, I have read, set a transcontinental speed
record by traveling from Los Angeles to New York in three hours and
23 minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As I say, things have changed a lot from those days. It now
takes three hours and 23 minutes just to get to the airport in
either Los Angeles or New York, no matter where to start from and
no matter what you're driving, even one of those bulky sports
utility vehicles you can't see around when they're in front of you
on the street. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Would the person who thought sports utility vehicles were a
good idea please identify yourself so the rest of us can yell at
you for a while?) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The truth of the matter is that I'm not sure yet quite how I
feel about Glenn returning to space. It's obviously a blatant
appeal to celebrity by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, which wants to restore public enthusiasm for its
programs. But it's also a strong statement against ageism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I guess I just hope honorary Ohio citizens won't be launched
next. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Oct. 25, moved Saturday in the `a' category and are
repeated Monday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-REVIEW _ It is often said that the weakness of the 1993
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord worked out in Oslo was that it was
embraced by only half of Israel, the secular liberals of European
origin, and ad never been sold to religious Israelis, the poor and
those of Middle Eastern origin. Now, three years after an Orthodox,
Yemenite Israeli student sought to end the peace deal by
assassinating Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, here were the
representatives of that other Israel coming to terms with the
reality that Oslo had created. By Ethan Bronner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEATH-PHOTOS-REVIEW _ Increasingly, if inconsistently,
disturbing images of the dead are finding their way into print and
on television. There are corpses without shrouds, without the
comfort of a soft focus. There are slack bodies, bloated bodies,
frozen frightened faces that make viewers turn away. In fits and
starts, the conservative reflexes that made graphic death a rarity
in newspapers in the generation after the Vietnam War are being
supplanted by a willingness to use these images, with their
powerful emotional impact. By Felicity Barringer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PINOCHET-REVIEW _ It would seem impossible for Genaro Arriagada
not to feel some satisfaction at the arrest in London of his
country's former military dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet. As a
prominent academic in the years after Pinochet took power in Chile,
Arriagada churned out a series of critical studies on the military
and its rule. When Pinochet finally agreed to submit his regime to
a popular vote, Arriagada organized the coalition that campaigned
successfully for his defeat in a national referendum. By Tim
Golden. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GAYS-POLITICS-REVIEW _ The struggle between defiant advocates
and those who prefer to compromise has been mirrored in other civil
rights movements, notably the one for black rights. But the gay
rights movement is distinct because it is made up of such a diverse
universe _ covering all ideologies, economic classes and races. Its
members share only two traits: sexual orientation and, most likely,
the experience of discrimination. It is not surprising, then, that
the movement as a whole has never reached a consensus about its
mission: An equal rights bill? Admission to the military? The right
to marry? To be left alone? By Adam Nagourney. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-REVIEW _ Until last week, most Americans thought of
Bill Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corp., as a genius and
innovator. A nerd perhaps _ but also a self-styled visionary who
almost single-handedly unlocked the power of the personal computer.
On Monday, however, in a Washington, D.C. courtroom, the Justice
Department began painting a different, darker portrait of Gates. In
an antitrust suit brought by the department and 20 states, the man
whose company commands a 97 percent share of the market for
personal computer operating systems is being depicted as a Nixonian
schemer who will go to almost any length to crush his competition.
By John Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   LT-GOVERNORS-REVIEW _ When it comes to questions of how
seriously one should view the backup quarterbacks in the nation's
state capitals, the answers often depend on the particular stadiums
in which they are warming the bench. In some states, the No. 2
person actually has clout, and campaigns for the job are serious
matters. By Jacques Steinberg. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EURO-CURRENCY-REVIEW _ Just 10 weeks before 11 European
countries adopt the euro as a common currency on Jan. 1, eventually
replacing marks, francs and lira, Europe has suddenly become the
world's bastion of economic safety. Far from being alarmed about
the changes and uncertainties ahead, traders have seized upon
European currencies _ including the lira _ as their preferred safe
haven from the turmoil rocking Asia, Russia and now even the United
States. By Edmund L. Andrews. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PEACE-MESSENGERS-REVIEW _ In the television-oriented 1990s,
policy wonks are using celebrities to get their messages across.
Maybe it is inevitable that groups like the population fund, which
provides contraception and counseling, would turn to entertainers
and athletes to reach a wider audience than do the policy-makers
who inhabit Sunday-morning interview shows. At the United Nations,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan has his own ``messengers for peace'' _
Magic Johnson, Muhammad Ali, Elie Wiesel and Michael Douglas, who
said last summer that ``this probably means as much to me as any of
the two Oscars that I got.'' By James Barron. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-MILOSEVIC-REVIEW _ Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's strongman,
knows the playbook well. His first big performance was in Bosnia;
his second has just been completed in the Serbian province of
Kosovo. The plot goes like this: As a divided West looks the other
way, create a crisis. Pursue your ends a little too harshly by
destroying a few too many villages, permitting one too many
massacres. Finally you catch Washington's attention. Then in a
grand gesture grant some concessions _ like allowing monitors on
the ground in Kosovo and NATO surveillance planes above. The
climax: You are elevated to the position of indispensable keeper of
the peace; American and NATO officials come to consult and
sometimes to scold. It all serves to pump you up in the eyes of
your own people, to whom you present yourself as their champion and
protector against hostile outsiders, namely the West, with which
you have just done a deal. As a result, you are guaranteed more
years in power as their autocratic ruler. By Jane Perlez.

 FILLING IN PEACE'S DETAILS IS THE PAINFUL PART 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturdsay, October(The Week in Review) 
(DUPLICATION WARNING: Also sent with `i' code)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The images were arresting. There they were, Ariel Sharon, who
once sent the Israeli military to Beirut for Yasser Arafat's head,
and Benjamin Netanyahu, who long avoided shaking the man's hand,
sitting together in Maryland agreeing with the Palestinian leader
on land and airports and prisoner releases.
</P>
<P>
   It is often said that the weakness of the 1993
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord worked out in Oslo, Norway, was
that it was embraced by only half of Israel, the secular liberals
of European origin, and had never been sold to religious Israelis,
the poor and those of Middle Eastern origin.
</P>
<P>
   Now, three years after an Orthodox, Yemenite Israeli student
sought to end the peace deal by assassinating Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, here were the representatives of that other Israel
coming to terms with the reality that Oslo had created.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they were making it hard with their near walkouts and
last-minute demands. But that was the way toward real peace: you
relinquish holy land with a tear in your eye and an ache in your
gut, not with the detachment of the previous government. Here were
negotiators who understood the fears as well as the hopes of their
people, who could build an agreement that might survive those
fears. Rabin, the messenger of peace, may have died, but his
message has survived.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But the past five years _ since Rabin and Arafat shook
hands on the White House lawn _ have offered sobering lessons on
why optimism has rarely held sway in this process since.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the intimate and personal Oslo negotiations, at
the Wye Plantation it took the president of the United States and
the King of Jordan days and nights of prodding to produce this next
interim step. And its implementation is highly complex.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, details and implementation posed formidable barriers
to peace from the start. What is different this time is that the
Wye agreement comes in the context of difficult experience in
making specific peace arrangements work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until Netanyahu's election more than two years ago, the
message from the government was that we have to begin a new life
with the Palestinians; let's be neighbors,'' said Yoel Esteron,
managing editor of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. ``But now there
is no spirit of reconciliation. What we have is a deal among
technocrats, a deal with no soul or spirit because there is so
little good feeling left.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Shlomo Gazit, a former director of Israel's military
intelligence, put it this way: ``I am very doubtful that this is a
new beginning. For the process to go on, there must be trust and
understanding between the two sides and a joint will to move ahead
to an overall agreement. What happened in recent months does not
bring us any nearer to that.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the Palestinians and Israelis agreed to make
peace five years ago but never did much to alter the sense they had
of each other. Schools on both sides have virtually no lessons in
the other's history. Maps in Palestinian schools still show only
the names of Palestinian villages destroyed by Israel, not the new
Israeli cities. Israeli maps and textbooks make no reference to the
destroyed Palestinian towns or to the life and culture of
Palestinians before Zionist immigration in the late 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   An official 8th-grade textbook from the Palestinian Authority
was recently shown to include the sentence, ``The prime examples of
racial discrimination are Zionism and Nazism.'' Last August,
Palestinian television was showing footage of a summer camp with
youngsters training with automatic weapons and chanting, ``I
foresee my death and I rush toward it!'' and, ``A hero's death, the
death of a suicide warrior!''
</P>
<P>
   Esteron of Haaretz said that even the largely liberal, educated
Israeli readers of his newspaper seem unmoved by the difficulties
that Palestinians suffer as a result of Israeli rules and
regulations _ checkpoints, bans on home building, severe
restrictions on trade, industry and movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at it as if it were somewhere in the Philippines,
not right next door,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Each side has tended to consider the Oslo accord a kind of
apology from the other, an acknowledgment that it had done wrong.
But each side sees only the other's misdeeds, not its own.
</P>
<P>
   And the problem that has overwhelmed all others is the enormous
imbalance _ military, geopolitical and economic _ between Israel
and the Palestinians. For many Palestinians, Israel is simply a
neighborhood outpost of the U.S.-dominated global economy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since the new global system has little place in it for land,
clan and honor, values upon which Palestinian society has long been
built, and can be so unforgiving to those not part of it, Israel is
seen as a threat in the most fundamental way to the values of many
in the West Bank and Gaza. To many there, Israel stands for sexual
permissiveness and godlessness, and so the battle against it goes
beyond a fight over land and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is, of course, still more complicated. A battle over
values exists within Israel itself, where a religious-secular
divide threatens internal politics. Rabin's assassin, Yigal Amir,
like many Sephardi and religious Israelis, felt that peace was
draining the nation of its biblical mission and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Netanyahu and Sharon the advocates of peace, the
opponents of peace within Israel may feel more and more
marginalized. But that does not necessarily mean Israelis will see
Palestinians in a more generous light. Israelis feel that what they
are giving up is not fully appreciated _ as Netanyahu has said, 1
percent of the West Bank is the size of Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the end of this process includes something that
bears the name ``State of Palestine,'' as the Palestinians so
fervently hope and the majority of Israelis now accept, many doubt
it will end the century-old Jewish-Arab conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal does not change the basic rules of the game,''
asserted Meron Benvenisti, a former deputy mayor of Jerusalem and
advocate of greater Israeli concessions. ``Let's say the
Palestinians get even 50 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about water resources, land development, sewage.
Israelis use five times the water of Palestinians. What happens
when the Palestinians want more? Where will it come from?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis will say: `We gave all we could. No more. The
rest is ours.' So what the Palestinians will get is exactly what
the Israelis can live with, peace without any real price. That's
why they don't care if there is a Palestinian state. That's why
even Sharon and Netanyahu can accept a state, because of the way
they will define it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali Jarbawi, a Palestinian political scientist at Bir Zeit
University in the West Bank, said he was equally pessimistic. ``I
think that for Netanyahu this week's deal is the end of the track
altogether,'' he said. ``He won't give up much more land. And what
kind of state will we get? There will be cantons with no direct
links. It is a gloomy prospect for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Ben-Simon, a political analyst for Haaretz, said he
believes the new accord will reshape Israeli politics because the
issue that has defined left and right for so long _ territorial
concession and a Palestinian state _ will no longer be there. In
addition, he says that because of the Palestinian question, other
Israeli problems, like the religious and ethnic divides, have
festered. Now they can be dealt with and that process will produce
an entirely new set of parties and coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   But Gazit, the former military intelligence chief, is far less
hopeful. He believes that Sharon and Netanyahu have no long-term
vision for the Palestinian question.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is huge writing on the wall,'' he said. ``It shows us
that without a comprehensive agreement with our neighbors we are
doomed ultimately to war. I think the politicians see it. But they
don't have the courage to act on it.''

 PAINTING BILL GATES AS A VILLAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, October(The Week in Review) 
(EDS: optional sidebar at end of article) 
(bl) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Will it matter to consumers that Bill Gates isn't a nice guy?
 &HT;    Until last week, most Americans thought of Gates, the chairman
of the Microsoft Corp., as a genius and innovator. A nerd perhaps _
but also a self-styled visionary who almost single-handedly
unlocked the power of the personal computer.
 &HT;    Monday, however, in a Washington courtroom, the Justice
Department began painting a different, darker portrait of Gates. In
an antitrust suit brought by the department and 20 states, the man
whose company commands a 97 percent share of the market for
personal computer operating systems is being depicted as a Nixonian
schemer who will go to almost any length to crush his competition.
 &HT;    Product innovation, the suit argues, is not a sufficient weapon
for Gates. Flashing back and forth between snippets of Gates'
videotaped deposition and e-mail messages he had sent that
contradicted his testimony, the government sought to establish a
pattern of threats and offers of payments by the Microsoft
chairman. It also sought to cast Gates as an obsessed man who
feared the tiny Netscape Communications Corp. and its potential
threat to his domination of the market for Internet browsers, the
software used to navigate the World Wide Web.
 &HT;    Gates was portrayed by Justice Department litigator David Boies
as a schoolyard bully who rides roughshod over the computer
industry with a crudeness that is in stark contrast to his popular
image as a benevolent dictator and high-technology guru. According
to a document presented by Boies, for example, Gates asked America
Online executives in 1996: ``How much do we need to pay you'' to
damage Netscape? ``This is your lucky day.''
 &HT;    The implication, Boies said, was that the amount was irrelevant,
and that Microsoft, with its deep pockets and market dominance,
makes as many ``offers you can't refuse'' as needed to achieve its
goals.
 &HT;    Microsoft officials are closely watching market surveys for any
hint that the new image of a bare-knuckled Gates might be
detracting from the company's world-famous brand name, but they
insist that the public will continue to draw a distinction between
allegations of anticompetitive business tactics and the company's
software.
 &HT;    ``Despite what you're reading in the press, people judge us by
our products,'' said Mich Matthews, head of Microsoft's corporate
public-relations office. ``Our experience is that people vote with
their pocketbooks.''
 &HT;    So far, consumers are casting positive votes. Last week
Microsoft reported quarterly profits of $1.52 billion, a stunning
58 percent increase over the level a year earlier.
 &HT;    Despite the record profits, some marketing experts say that if
the public comes to view Gates as a Rockefeller-style robber baron,
his company and its brand name may suffer.
 &HT;    ``When you have a company with such a visible chief executive,
the CEO is really the driver of the brand,'' said David Aaker, a
brand marketing expert at the Haas School of Business at the
University of California at Berkeley. ``There is no question this
is going to affect Microsoft's brand recognition.''
 &HT;    Already there are early warning signals, as political cartoons
in newspapers across the country bashed Gates last week. One showed
him holding a globe and saying, ``If you don't play my way, I'll
take my ball and go home''; another portrayed the Microsoft
chairman standing next to a henchman dangling someone from a window
while a Microsoft secretary says to a caller, ``I'm sorry, but Mr.
Gates is busy teaching a competitor about Windows.''
 &HT;    But some industry analysts believe the new view of a Bill Gates
who knows how to play hardball may not be such a bad thing for his
company. The he-said, she-said round of e-mail messages being
dragged out in court cases both in Washington and in Silicon
Valley, where Microsoft is locked in a legal battle with its
archrival, Sun Microsystems Inc., is viewed by some as little
different from the exaggerated trash talking that goes on in
professional sports.
 &HT;    ``It's like taking what Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan say
to each other on the ball court'' and turning it into something
more sinister than it really is, said Paul Andrews, co-author with
Stephen Manes of ``Gates'' (Doubleday, 1993).
 &HT;    Indeed, there is evidence that the darker view of Gates and his
company has so far taken root only in the District of Columbia and
in Silicon Valley, where the computer industry has long felt the
impact of Gates' tactics, and where bitterness and distrust of
Microsoft are deep.
 &HT;    In the rest of the country, Gates continues to enjoy great
popularity. Two weeks ago, while speaking before a crowd of almost
7,000 students at Indiana University, a questioner who asked about
the Justice Department's suit was roundly booed.
 &HT;

 &HT;    BILL GATES, WHIPPING BOY
 &HT;    c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is Bill Gates a high-tech Machiavelli, Public Enemy No. 1 or a
threat to the known universe? All three, judging from the numerous
political cartoons that popped up in newspapers across the country
last week.
</P>
<P>
   From Chattanooga to Boston, cartoonists took delight in
demonizing Gates, who is facing an unexpected public relations
challenge as Microsoft's antitrust trial unfolds in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Other cartoons ran the gamut from the predictable (a worker,
pointing to an aquarium in which a large fish is gobbling up
smaller ones, saying to some visitors, ``Welcome to Microsoft's
research and development department'') to the weird (a dweebish man
hunched in front of a computer screen staring at the words: ``Our
beloved leader, Mr. Gates, is under attack. Leave your possessions.
Go to the desert. Await the spaceship'').
</P>
<P>
   And that was just Week One of the trial. Stay tuned.

 GAY POLITICS AND ANTI-POLITICS: A MOVEMENT DIVIDED 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, October(The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thousands of gay demonstrators scrapped with police
officers in midtown Manhattan on Monday, protesting the violent
death of a young gay man in Wyoming. The clash recalled the
Stonewall uprising, the brawl between homosexuals and policemen
outside a Greenwich Village bar that launched the gay rights
movement in 1969. Many of the people gathered in front of the Plaza
Hotel last week had marched in Greenwich Village 29 years before.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a very different expression of the gay rights movement
was taking place in Washington. In a tense, quarrelsome conference
call, 22 members of the board of directors of the Human Rights
Campaign, the most mainstream of American gay organizations, voted
to endorse Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato over Democratic Rep.
Charles Schumer in New York's U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   This was the same D'Amato who had been the target of many of the
gay men and women the night before; they were outraged by the
anti-homosexual positions of many of his Republican colleagues,
especially his allies in the state Legislature who have blocked
consideration of a gay rights bill.
</P>
<P>
   As discordant as they might appear, the events in New York and
Washington accurately reflected two major forces that have roiled
the gay rights movement over the decades. This inherently fractious
political movement has been torn by a struggle between pragmatic
homosexuals who seek to work with government and more hostile
advocates who tend to view government as an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, a group of young, radical New Yorkers formed the Gay
Liberation Front, pushing aside the staid Mattachine Society, whose
suit-and-tie leaders had quietly worked with Mayor John Lindsay to
end entrapment of homosexuals in public bathrooms and police
harassment of gay bars. Fifteen years later, young protesters
picketed the Municipal Elections Committee of Los Angeles, the
city's pioneer gay political action committee, after its leaders,
adopting the anti-AIDS position of the more conservative forces in
local government, called for bathhouses to close. The creation of
Act Up in 1987 was, from its first demonstration in the financial
district, a repudiation of established gay rights groups from
Washington to New York.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the Human Rights Campaign plays the
inside-the-system role. The organization, the first national gay
political action committee, distinguished itself upon its founding
in the early 1980's by holding black-tie fund-raisers at the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, though it might be better remembered for the
alliance it struck with D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle between defiant advocates and those who prefer to
compromise has been mirrored in other civil rights movements,
notably the one for black rights. But the gay rights movement is
distinct because it is made up of such a diverse universe _
covering all ideologies, economic classes and races. Its members
share only two traits: sexual orientation and, most likely, the
experience of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising, then, that the movement as a whole has
never reached a consensus about its mission: An equal rights bill?
Admission to the military? The right to marry? To be left alone?
</P>
<P>
   The tension between those who want a place at the table and
those who want to throw rocks through the window has been one of
the few constants. On one side, the gathering at the Plaza Hotel,
like that at the Stonewall Inn, was a spontaneous venting of
frustration and a classic display of take-it-to-the-streets
politics. No major organization put out the call for the protest;
there was no list of demands, no leader. The spark was Matthew
Shepard, the 21-year-old University of Wyoming student murdered in
what authorities described as a bias-related crime.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, the Human Rights Campaign is about as
establishment as politics get in Washington, with an annual budget
of $13 million, a board of directors and stationery. Vice President
Al Gore attends its annual dinner, which brings in money for
candidates who support gay rights measures.
</P>
<P>
   And like all establishment homosexual groups of the past 30
years, it is focused and pragmatic. Its members practice the kind
of politics that the street firebrands have either rejected or
failed to understand, starting with compromise.
</P>
<P>
   To many people in New York, the notion of a gay rights
organization endorsing D'Amato may seem astonishing. To the Human
Rights Campaign it was the obvious decision: D'Amato took its side
on many gay rights issues in recent years. And in a race involving
two candidates with similar records on gay issues, the group has a
policy of picking the incumbent. This determined pragmatism comes
at a time when the board has been trying to demonstrate to
Washington its readiness to work with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to appreciate the divergent views is to consider
two people who were at the center of both the disturbances at the
Stonewall and the Plaza Hotel: Andrew Tobias, a financial writer
who is a member of the Human Rights Campaign board, and Jim
Fouratt, a New York record producer who protested in front of the
Stonewall and in front of the Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Tobias, who organized a fund-raiser for Schumer, makes a
passionate case for Schumer's election. ``I'm terrified of a
filibuster-proof Senate,'' he said, referring to the possibility
that Democrats will hold fewer than 40 seats after Nov. 3. ``And I
have very strong feelings about choice.'' D'Amato, unlike Schumer,
opposes abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Tobias fully supports what his board did. How could the
Human Rights Campaign hope to convince other Republicans to follow
D'Amato's path and defy party orthodoxy, he asked, if it turned its
back on the senator now? It is a nuanced position, he acknowledged,
but a rational one. ``Clearly, D'Amato, by all of our policies,
earned and deserved the endorsement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely the kind of argument that has perplexed people
like Fouratt for years. D'Amato's endorsement was ``shocking,''
Fouratt said, nothing more than the latest example of the
short-sightedness of the ``middle class,'' as he disparagingly
calls the establishment homosexuals. ``You don't change people's
opinions and attitudes by power-brokering,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fouratt did not say it, but that is about the same point he made
28 years ago, when another group of gay activists, the Gay
Activists Alliance, tried to nudge their new movement into the
mainstream by lobbying for a gay rights bill in New York City. It
seems safe to say it is a difference of opinion that is going to be
troubling this movement for a long time.

 ARRESTING AN EX-DICTATOR IS ONE THING. THEN IT GETS TOUGH. 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Not so many years ago, it would have been impossible to find
Genaro Arriagada on the side of Chile's former military dictator,
Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   As a prominent academic in the years after Pinochet took power
in 1973, Arriagada churned out critical studies of the military and
its rule. When Pinochet finally agreed to submit his regime to a
popular vote in 1988, Arriagada organized the coalition that
campaigned successfully for his defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But as street demonstrations in Chile began to turn violent late
last week, following the 82-year-old general's arrest in London on
Oct. 16 on human rights charges filed by a Spanish judge, Arriagada
argued bitterly against the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   And though he had just taken over as Chile's new ambassador to
Washington, his reasons, it seemed, have more to do with his own
views than with his government's arguments that Pinochet should be
protected by diplomatic immunity or released on humanitarian
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the achievement of our transition back to democracy
has been to take all of the demons of this history and put them
into some kind of closet,'' Arriagada said in an interview. ``This
case brings them all back out again. What right does some Spanish
judge have to do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of Pinochet's arrest, a parade of law professors
was pointing out that a strong basis for his prosecution has been
established over the past decade in international law. The threat
of what are often called universal crimes, so grotesquely
demonstrated in Africa and the Balkans, has prompted many states,
especially in Western Europe, to codify in their national laws the
jurisdiction that international conventions have offered since the
aftermath of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But Arriagada and others maintain that unlike the recent
prosecutions of accused war criminals from Bosnia and Rwanda, the
success of human-rights lawyers targeting Pinochet will almost
certainly come at the expense of the uneasy political compromise by
which Chile achieved a measure of reconciliation and peace.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that argument, moreover, lie serious practical
difficulties in mounting a legally compelling case against figures
like Pinochet _ particularly at a distance of several thousand
miles.
</P>
<P>
   When the investigating judge, Baltasar Garzon, prevailed on
Scotland Yard to arrest the general on charges of murder, genocide
and terrorism relating both to 94 Spanish citizens and others among
the more than 3,000 people believed to have been killed during
Pinochet's reign, he overcame only the first obstacle to
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Garzon must persuade Spain's right-of-center government to
formalize his request for the general's extradition. Then he must
convince British Home Secretary Jack Straw to grant the
extradition. Then Garzon will almost certainly need some help from
the government of Chile to build a successful criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be seeing an increasing readiness by governments to
enforce these international human-rights laws,'' said Theodor
Meron, a professor of international law at New York University.
``But when you open up the code book and try to prosecute, you find
that you have to deal with a lot of bread-and-butter criminal
statutes to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers, judges and activists seeking justice for
human-rights crimes are not the only ones running into such
challenges. Since the end of the Cold War, countries like France,
Britain and the United States have tried to extend the reach of
their laws across borders to combat crimes like terrorism and drug
trafficking. Although these efforts have had a more solid legal
foundation than the human-rights cases, they have run constantly
into questions of sovereignty and jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Switzerland were reminded of such difficulties last
week when they announced the seizure of $114 million that was
hidden in European banks by Raul Salinas de Gortari, the elder
brother of Mexico's former President.
</P>
<P>
   To some U.S. law-enforcement officials, the Swiss detectives had
done heroic work: They had started out with virtually no experience
in Mexico's narcotics underworld, and faced considerable resistance
from some officials in Mexico and the United States. Still, they
managed to use a legal-assistance treaty to pry open U.S. jails.
There they found informants who, in several cases, had apparently
been ignored or mishandled by U.S. prosecutors, and who said they
had witnessed Salinas taking huge bribes from drug traffickers to
arrange for the protection of their loads.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, many Mexican officials viewed the conclusions
of the Swiss investigation differently. They acknowledged that
Swiss detectives might have developed enough evidence to keep the
money; if Salinas' lawyers challenge the seizure in court, as they
have promised to do, the Swiss government will only have to argue a
civil rather rather than a criminal case _ one with a considerably
lower standard of proof than what would be required to convict
Pinochet. Nonetheless, the Swiss investigators were hit immediately
by a barrage of procedural and jurisdictional questions from
Mexican officials.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. Customs agents learned last May when they set off a
diplomatic confrontation by disclosing that they operated under
cover in Mexico to trap bankers accused of laundering drug money,
it is hard to overestimate how quickly concerns about sovereignty
can outweigh those of criminal justice when one country sees
another acting unilaterally on its soil or in its affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Chilean nationalists, former British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher offered such an argument on Pinochet's behalf
last week. ``The people of Chile, through successively elected
democratic governments, have determined how they should come to
terms with their past,'' she wrote to The Times of London. ``An
essential part of that process has been the settlement of the
status of General Pinochet and it is not for Spain, Britain or any
other country to interfere in what is an internal matter for
Chile.''
</P>
<P>
   At nearly a decade's remove, the deal that centrist politicians
like Arriagada reluctantly cut with Pinochet strikes many Chileans
as too generous, even accounting for the relative prosperity and
political stability that the country has enjoyed since. Others,
including some of the general's critics, argue that however
unsatisfying Chile's solution might have been, the strength of its
example can be seen in similar accommodations with military rulers
and repressive regimes from Central America to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these transitions to democracy were just about trials, we
could leave them to the judges,'' Arriagada said. ``But these
transitions are about achieving a great number of goals, including
political goals, economic goals _ and also human rights goals.''

 BREAKING A TABOO, EDITORS TURN TO IMAGES OF DEATH  
(The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One spring afternoon in 1994, a University of Wyoming freshman
was shot in the head at point-blank range and left to die. A day or
two later, The Laramie Daily Boomerang shoved the event in the
community's face, printing a front-page photograph of the young
man's body as it lay near his dormitory. The figures of police
officers partly blocked the view. But only partly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing a story about somebody being gunned down in the
busiest intersection of town in cold blood didn't have the same
impact as seeing it,'' said managing editor Robert Wilson, whose
daily newspaper has a circulation of about 8,000. ``I wanted people
to feel that horror. I particularly wanted young people to see that
this isn't a movie we're playing here. This is real.''
</P>
<P>
   Outrage was what Wilson wanted. Outrage was what he got _
directed not against the killers or the crime, but against the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, if inconsistently, images of the dead are finding
their way into print and onto television. There are corpses without
shrouds, without the comfort of a soft focus. There are slack
bodies, bloated bodies, frozen, frightened faces that make viewers
turn away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something I wish to see alongside my breakfast,''
an angry reader wrote to The New York Times three weeks ago when
the newspaper ran a photograph of a massacre victim in Kosovo, his
face contorted.
</P>
<P>
   In fits and starts, the reflexes that made graphic death a
rarity in newspapers in the generation after the Vietnam War are
being supplanted by a willingness to use such images for their
emotional impact.
</P>
<P>
   An uncomfortable fact for journalists is that their use has an
editorial tone at odds with the buttoned-down objectivity of news
columns. But images from Rwanda, Kosovo and Algeria have focused
popular outrage. The larger the point to be made, the more willing
editors have been to use visual horror to make that point.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean there has never been graphic death in
newspapers. In the first decades of the 20th century, pictures of
dead mobsters and suicides filled the tabloids. But in the last two
decades, along with the rise of graphic violence on television and
in the movies, both the grittier tabloids and the more restrained
broadsheets took a different approach. Instead of embracing all
disturbing images, editors waited until a particularly visceral
image captured a visceral moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bombing victims in Kosovo look the same as bombing victims 10
years ago in Iran,'' said Eric Meskauskas, photo editor of The New
York Daily News. ``You wind up trying to look for something that
has something else in it that makes it more powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Since we've seen almost everything there is to see
in this age, what photo editors are trying to do is make you feel
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Some photographs have ``outrage quality,'' said Michael Smith, a
deputy picture editor at The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take the baby in the Oklahoma City bombing,'' he said,
speaking of the photograph by Charles Porter, an amateur, showing a
firefighter cradling the dead body of one-year-old Baylee Almon.
``People agonized over it because it was a baby. Nobody wants to
put a baby in the paper. But it so symbolized the loss of
innocence, the fact that we were as vulnerable to terrorism as
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Editors who chose to run photographs of charred corpses in a
Nairobi morgue after this summer's embassy bombing, or the face of
an old Albanian man killed in a Kosovo massacre, made the same
argument. At a panel discussion at the Newseum in New York
recently, Meskauskas said, ``I think you have to use it because it
tells you something about terrorism and what the people were
feeling like.''
</P>
<P>
   The visible dead tend to have two things in common. For one,
they have usually died at human hands. With the exception of the
youth whose ash-covered body was photographed from the air after
the explosion at Mount St. Helens in 1980, dead victims of natural
disasters, as well as victims of airplane crashes, tend not to be
shown in the news media. As a senior photo editor described it,
without a moral lesson to be drawn, there is no point in showing
corpses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at a war,'' said Vincent Alabiso, the executive
photo editor of The Associated Press, ``one image can somehow
define a story and crystallize your feelings some way or another,
and can force you to decide on a point of view you might take.
That's different from looking at a hurricane picture.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A second factor common to many images of the dead in newspapers
is their distance from readers. While no generalization is
foolproof, it is safe to say that the farther away the dead person
is, physically or psychologically, the more likely that the image
will find its way into print.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people really want to look at highly disturbing
photographs, and the closer to home, the more disturbing the
images,'' said Gail Buckland, a photo historian and an associate
professor at Cooper Union in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dead bodies in Africa are more tolerated,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Meskauskas, have a simpler explanation: Crime
scenes in the West are tightly controlled. None of the editors
interviewed had seen images of the bodies of James Byrd, the black
man dragged to death in Jasper, Texas, last summer, or Matthew
Shepard, the gay college student tied to a fence, beaten and left
to die two weeks ago in Laramie, Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The rollicking, anything-goes photojournalism of the 1920s and
1930s changed during World War II, according to John Morris, a
former photographer and picture editor for Life magazine, ``The
rule was: We can show enemy dead but not our own people. Especially
faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first big breakthrough occurred in 1943,'' added Morris,
who was also picture editor at The New York Times in the 1960s and
1970s. ``Life ran a photo from Buna Beach in New Guinea. That
picture was held up in censorship in Washington for about eight
months before it was released. It showed two or three American
bodies face down in the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Censorship was eased during the Vietnam War, but returned during
the Persian Gulf war; The Detroit Free Press' photographer, David
Turnley, had to argue and cajole the military censors to approve a
photograph of a soldier crying next to a body bag.
</P>
<P>
   But censorship had little role to play in 1993 during the
ill-fated U.S. military involvement in Somalia. The Toronto Star's
image of a dead U.S. serviceman dragged through the street by mobs
went around the world. ``We ran the poor American soldier who was
dragged through the streets in Mogadishu,'' said Michele
Stephenson, the director of photography for Time magazine. ``We
felt we needed to do that to show what was going on there.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his decision to put the corpse of a murdered college
student before his readers, Wilson, of The Laramie Daily Boomerang,
would not quickly do it again. Even had photos of Shepard tied to
the fence existed, he said, the cruelty of the crime was such that
``I don't think I or anyone else could have faced a photograph of
it.''

(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, October LIEUTENANT GOVERNORS: IT'S SO HARD TO BE No. 2  
(The Week in Review) 
(DUPLICATION WARNING: Also sent with `p' code) 
(bl) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a meeting at an Albany hotel recently, the Democratic nominee
for New York lieutenant governor was introduced as Sandra Feldman,
the longtime teachers' union leader. Never mind that the
candidate's name is Sandra Frankel and that the speaker was none
other than the chairwoman of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Frankel, a town supervisor from the Rochester area, had
suffered such indignities before; in an earlier party press release
she had been called Barbara. The gaffes were telling in a state
where the second-ranking job in government involves little more
than refereeing Senate debates and has become so marginalized that
New York's current lieutenant governor, Betsy McCaughey Ross,
hasn't had a substantive conversation with Gov. George Pataki in at
least three years.
</P>
<P>
   But their relationship is not typical. When it comes to
questions of how seriously one should view the backup quarterbacks
in the nation's state capitals, the answers often depend on the
particular stadiums in which they are warming the bench. In some
states, the No. 2 person actually has clout, and campaigns for the
job are serious matters.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, for example, where the lieutenant governor has broad
authority to shape the legislative agenda, this year's race has
been tough and personal. Ads for the Republican candidate, Mitch
Skandalakis, imply that his Democratic opponent, Mark Taylor, has
resumed a prior, admitted cocaine problem. Taylor responded with a
lawsuit accusing his opponent of slander.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, where Gov. George W. Bush is expected to win
re-election next month, attention has shifted to the lieutenant
governor's race, in part because the winner would succeed Bush if
he were to win the presidency in 2000. Texas is among 18 states in
which voters can choose a governor and lieutenant governor of
different parties, and often do. To head off such a situation,
Bush's famous father has made a TV commercial on behalf of the
Republican who would be his son's understudy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job is what you make it,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a
political analyst at Claremont Graduate University in California,
who was speaking of her home state but could have easily been
citing many others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nelson Rockefeller referred to the vice presidency as `standby
equipment,''' she added. ``If you are the lieutenant governor and
your governor is not of the same party, you're not even perceived
as standby equipment. You're out there in orbit.''
</P>
<P>
   California Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, has been in such an
orbit for four years. Whenever Republican Gov. Pete Wilson leaves
the state, Davis' office floods reporters' fax machines with press
releases that begin, ``Acting Governor and gubernatorial candidate
Gray Davis. . . .'' Davis is now running to succeed Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   But that pales in comparison to the friction two decades ago
between former Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, and Mike Curb, his
Republican lieutenant. Once, Ms. Bebitch Jeffe recalled, Brown
raced to get a flight back to California because Curb was trying to
capitalize on the governor's absence by appointing a conservative
judge whom Brown opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Some view the lieutenant's job as a steppingstone. After a
16-year career as Georgia's lieutenant governor, Zell Miller was
elected governor in 1990. Bob Finch, the first lieutenant governor
in California under Ronald Reagan, was appointed secretary of
health, education and welfare by President Richard M. Nixon. And
Mario Cuomo, elected New York's lieutenant governor in 1978, was
elected governor in the next three elections.
</P>
<P>
   But others have gone the route of Malcolm Wilson, who waited in
the wings behind Rockefeller for 15 years and became governor in
1973, when Rockefeller chose to step down before the end of his
term. Wilson was defeated the next year by Hugh Carey. Still,
Wilson was governor long enough to leave a legacy, of sorts: The
Tappan Zee Bridge was renamed the Gov. Malcolm Wilson Tappan Zee
Bridge in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his successors in the No. 2 spot have found fame more
fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   Having found little to occupy his time during the Cuomo
administration, Alfred DelBello resigned the lieutenant governor's
post in 1985 to take a position with a waste management firm in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Mary Anne Krupsak, Carey's lieutenant. She
failed to unseat him in the 1978 Democratic primary and never again
held elected office. She now runs a chamber of commerce for the
counties in the Finger Lakes area and is the co-owner of Pasta
Only's, a restaurant in Geneva, N.Y.

   &UR; The Farewell Symphony &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Edmund White. Vintage International, $14.
</P>
<P>
   The final installment of the author's autobiographical trilogy,
which began in 1982 with ``A Boy's Own Story,'' chronicles gay life
in New York in the post-Stonewall years, when the city's cultural
world was ravaged by the AIDS virus. Last year in the Book Review,
Christopher Benfey called this an ``engagingly bittersweet novel.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where She Came From: A Daughter's Search for Her Mother's
History &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Helen Epstein. Plume, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   This memoir, which focuses on the author's great-grandmother,
grandmother and mother, is also a detailed history of Jewish life
in the small towns of western Czechoslovakia in the years leading
up to World War II. ``This book is more than a family portrait,''
Ruth Gay wrote in the Book Review last year. ``It is a moving
evocation of an old world and its destruction.''  &UR; Shtetl: The Life
and Death of a Small Town and the World of Polish Jews &LR; , by Eva
Hoffman (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14), examines the little
village, or shtetl, of Bransk, and its Orthodox Jewish community,
which once formed more than half the population but is nonexistent
today. In the process, the author re-examines the general
condemnation of ordinary Poles for their part in the Holocaust. In
1997 our reviewer, Susan Zuccotti, found the author ``supremely
qualified for her task.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Death of Innocents &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Richard Firstman and Jamie Talan. Bantam, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   This harrowing true account tells of how a mother killed her
five children and got away with it for more than 20 years, thanks
to the unwitting help of misguided scientists who attributed the
deaths to sudden infant death syndrome. ``The book is paced like a
thriller'' and is ''a showcase for superb research and
organization,'' Frederick Busch wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Lover &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Marguerite Duras. Translated by Barbara Bray. Pantheon, $10.
</P>
<P>
   In this compact French novel, an aging woman looks back on her
adolescence in Vietnam and her passionate affair with a wealthy
young Chinese man when she was 15. In 1985 in the Book Review,
Diane Johnson called this an ``authentic and completely successful
work'' that achieves ``a felicitous and masterly balance between
formalism and powerful emotional effect.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Love and Longing in Bombay: Stories &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Vikram Chandra. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $13.
</P>
<P>
   In a Bombay bar, a callow narrator spins five tales of
glitterati and gritty policemen, high finance and low crime. ``The
author marries his storytelling prowess to a profound understanding
of India's ageless and ever-changing society,'' Shashi Tharoor
wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Man of the People: A Life of Harry S. Truman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Alonzo L. Hamby. Oxford University, $21.50.
</P>
<P>
   A historian maintains that a thirst for recognition and respect
dominated Truman's life, and the man that emerges here is more
troubled and complicated than the one portrayed in other
biographies. ``'What Mr. Hamby has done, with great skill, is to
remind us of the real Harry Truman, to demythologize him without
slighting his accomplishments or his rough road to success,'' David
Oshinsky said here in 1995. He didn't walk that road alone.  &UR; Dear
Bess: The Letters From Harry to Bess Truman, 1910-1959 &LR; , edited by
Robert H. Ferrell (University of Missouri, $24.95), pulls together
nearly 600 letters to Elizabeth Virginia Wallace Truman, among the
least known of modern First Ladies but the center of her husband's
universe: without her he might have stayed a Missouri dirt farmer
all his life. This large volume provides ``an intimate look into
the heart and mind of the 33rd president,'' Geoffrey C. Ward wrote
here in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Election &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Tom Perrotta. Berkley, $12.
</P>
<P>
   A three-way race for student body president at a New Jersey high
school mutates from the routine into the disastrous, giving the
author an opportunity for lively riffing on teen-age angst and
intrigue. Earlier this year our reviewer, Peter LaSalle, praised
the ``gratifyingly exact and telling portraits'' of the young
characters. A far grimmer portrait of teen-age life is found in
 &UR; The Mao Game &LR; , by Joshua Miller (Bard/Avon, $12), in which a
morbidly witty child actor grapples with heroin addiction, the
aftershock of sexual molestation, psycho parents and Hollywood
vapidity. In 1997 in these pages, J. D. Biersdorfer found this to
be ``a vivid and affecting first novel about a young man's
emotional deprivation -- and his ultimate salvation.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Warrior's Honor: Ethnic War and the Modern Conscience &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Ignatieff. Owl/Holt, $13.
</P>
<P>
   These essays combine reportage and moral and political
speculation to try to make sense of Rwanda, Bosnia and other hot
zones of the new world order, and of the feeling of impotence that
has hamstrung the West. ``The structure of Ignatieff's argument is
simple, and to my mind irresistible,'' Alan Ryan wrote here earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Comeback &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Richard Stark. Mysterious Press/Warner, $12.
</P>
<P>
   Donald E. Westlake, writing under his old nom de plume,
resuscitates the master thief Parker in this crime caper about the
rip-off of a television evangelist's haul from a revival meeting.
``In a world of warped values, an honest crook like Parker is a
true treasure,'' Marilyn Stasio said here last year.

(DUPLICATION WARNING: Also sent with ``i'' code) 
(bl) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ An odd thing happened last week: A former
Communist became prime minister of Italy for the first time in
history, yet the Italian lira didn't drop in value amid fears of
left-wing economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly benign reaction stems in part from the reality of
Italian politics; the new government under Massimo D'Alema is a
hodgepodge of people from across the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also a telling sign about the peculiar condition of
Europe on the eve of its greatest experiment in the postwar era.
Just 10 weeks before 11 European countries adopt the euro as a
common currency Jan. 1, eventually replacing marks, francs and
lira, Europe has suddenly become the world's bastion of economic
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being alarmed about the changes and uncertainties
ahead, traders have seized upon European currencies _ including the
lira _ as their preferred safe haven from the turmoil rocking Asia,
Russia and now even the United States. European currencies have
soared about 10 percent against the dollar since August.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, that is testimony to Europe's soundness. But in
practice it is creating a baptism of fire for the euro and its
overseer, the new European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   That became clear last week. The debate now raging across the
continent is whether the euro will be a bit too credible and too
strong, meaning that European goods will become too expensive for
customers with other currencies. Precisely when the new central
bank is most preoccupied with proving its political independence,
politicians across Europe are badgering it for a weaker euro and
lower interest rates to stimulate borrowing and investment.
</P>
<P>
   The chorus got substantially louder last week, after the
European Commission reduced its prediction for economic growth next
year from 3.2 to 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, where the Social Democrats defeated Chancellor
Helmut Kohl in elections last month, the incoming chancellor,
Gerhard Schroeder, and his finance minister stepped up calls for
lower interest rates and even suggested a return to some form of
fixed exchange rates in world markets. In France, Socialist Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin, made similar calls. And at the European
Commission, officials are talking about softening the tough fiscal
requirements that it set to bring the economies of the 11 countries
in line with each other and thus insure the euro's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's new central bankers are getting even more pressure from
the United States. With the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates
in a sign of its own anxiety about the economy, the European
Central Bank is suddenly the odd man out as the world's most
hawkish supporter of hard money.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying all this is a more basic question about Europe's
condition. Even though economists have recently begun slashing
growth projections for next year, most still predict that Europe
under the euro _ thanks in part to trade efficiencies produced by
the use of one currency rather than many _ will grow faster than
the United States for the first time in many years.
</P>
<P>
   But as the rest of the world looks bleaker and bleaker, the
question boils down to this: Is Europe an ``island of stability,''
as many European leaders have argued? Or is it just the last domino
to fall in a worldwide slump? Naturally, there aren't many clear
signs. But there are trends worth noting.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most positive and least appreciated change is the
dramatic improvement in the competitiveness of European
manufacturing. Here in Germany, makers of cars and machinery have
learned to produce far more with far fewer people. They have also
redesigned their products, rethought the way they do business and
cut innovative deals with labor unions to win more flexibility in
the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Other developments are less encouraging. With the exception of
countries like the Netherlands, continental Europe continues to be
weighed down by high taxes, costly social programs and very high
labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, there are clear signs of what might be called
``reform fatigue.'' Having endured years of budget cuts to satisfy
fiscal requirements for the euro, voters have ushered in
left-leaning governments inclined to shore up social programs.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, who campaigned as a ``new'' and vaguely pro-business
Social Democrat, has infuriated German industry by charting a
return to left-wing priorities. His new coalition, which includes
the environmentalist Green Party for the first time, has pledged to
reverse the few labor reforms Kohl succeeded in pushing through.
More important, it has drafted a tax plan with little reduction in
the overall tax burden _ which consumes about half of Germany's
total output _ and shifts much of it to business. It has also given
tacit support to big wage demands by Germany's giant metalworking
union.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of Italy's centrist government under Romano Prodi
was an even more vivid sign of reform fatigue. Prodi lost his
parliamentary majority after the Reformed Communist Party rebelled
over his plans for a budget cut.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists tried the same thing last year, but they failed
because Italians wanted to reduce their budget deficit enough to
qualify for the euro. But all that changed last May, when Italy
made the grade and the pressure for austerity eased.
</P>
<P>
   Given all that, why are the currency markets so sanguine? The
answer is that politicians do not control the new central bank. And
the bank's president, Wim Duisenberg of the Netherlands, is almost
typecast for the role of the gruff banker who doesn't let
politicians push him around.
</P>
<P>
   A big man with piercing blue eyes and a shock of white hair,
Duisenberg has thus far refused to budge on his policies and has
perfected a curmudgeonly scowl that projects wonderfully over
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European Central Bank already has credibility in financial
markets, and you can see that from what has been happening,'' said
Bernhard Speyer, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank Research. But
the task ahead is not easy: a bit too tough and Duisenberg could
precipitate a real decline in Europe; a bit too easy and the euro's
strength could be undermined for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we face in 8 to 10 weeks from now is a major regime
shift, and in a situation like that there are always things that
can go wrong,'' said Speyer. ``You don't want to take any
chances.''

administration's $20 million budget request for the fund. To the
two television news crews and the few reporters who bothered to
attend, it was just another briefing.
</P>
<P>
   The other news conference, 200 miles away at U.N. headquarters
in New York City, played to a standing-room-only audience that will
not soon forget the scene. The main attraction was someone not
known for making policy pronouncements: Geri Halliwell, revered by
screaming teen-age fans as Ginger Spice. She had walked away from
the hugely popular singing group, the Spice Girls, several months
ago. The population fund hit the publicity jackpot by naming her a
``goodwill ambassador,'' for two television news services beamed
the news conference around the world live.
</P>
<P>
   In the television-oriented 1990s, policy wonks are using
celebrities to get their messages across. Maybe it is inevitable
that groups like the population fund, which provides contraception
and counseling, would turn to entertainers and athletes to reach a
wider audience than do the policy-makers who inhabit Sunday-morning
interview shows. At the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has his own ``messengers for peace'' _ Magic Johnson,
Muhammad Ali, Elie Wiesel and Michael Douglas, who said last summer
that ``this probably means as much to me as any of the two Oscars
that I got.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary-General Gillian Sorenson said the idea was
to keep from ``preaching to the converted.'' ``This gets us new
audiences, including especially young people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Halliwell joined a roster that includes the media-and-sports
tycoon Ted Turner and his wife, the actress Jane Fonda; the
Japanese actress Keiko Kishi, and the Finnish rock star Mikko
Kuustonen. Yes, Mikko Kuustonen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've never heard of him,'' said Corrie Shanahan, a
spokeswoman for the population fund, ``but he's huge in Finland,
huge. We look at donor countries where we want to raise awareness
and we choose someone who's big and popular and has the right
image.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The right image,'' she added, ``is someone who's passionate
and sincere about why they care about this.''
</P>
<P>
   But who may not talk in diplomatic language. Consider Ms.
Halliwell. ``I am famous,'' she said. ``And I am damn well going to
use my fame positively. If I save one person's life just by
awareness, I'm going to damn well do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't the United Nations the kind of place where never is heard
a provocative word? ``She's not in the U.N.,'' Ms. Shanahan said.
``This is why we have ambassadors. Geri Halliwell can reach and
influence young women in a way we can't, we being the people behind
the desks here. We don't have their attention, and that's it: She
has their attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But the U.N. bureaucracy may have found her less than
mesmerizing. The news service Agence France-Presse quoted one
official it did not identify as saying that Ms. Halliwell was ``not
up to'' the job of promoting family planning issues.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using celebrities to promote causes is hardly new.
``Unicef started it,'' said Ms. Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   A generation after Danny Kaye promoted the U.N. Children's Fund,
Diana, Princess of Wales, made land mines a post-divorce crusade.
And Linda McCartney, who became famous because she married a famous
man, tackled animal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Now Jay Leno's wife is following suit. Last week Mavis Leno
announced a $100,000 donation to the Feminist Majority Foundation,
a nonprofit group trying to rally opposition to what it calls the
Taliban's ``inhumane oppression of women'' in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I tell you? You probably know more than I do,'' Mrs.
Leno said in a conversation last week. ``What I'm bringing to the
issue is the visibility bestowed on me by the fact that I'm married
to Jay.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week was also a busy one for the four singers who have
carried on as Spice Girls since Ms. Halliwell abandoned them. They
sent a letter to President Nelson Mandela of South Africa that was
publicized by an animal-rights group, People for Ethical Treatment
of Animals. They asked Mandela to rescue 30 baby elephants they
said had been ``ripped from their families in Botswana and taken to
a warehouse near Pretoria.'' Animal-rights advocates say the
elephants have been beaten and starved to become ``zoo friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which left Ms. Maloney's press secretary, Terese
Schlachter, sighing. ``Maybe,'' she said, talking of how to
increase attendance at her boss' next news conference, ``we should
make her Congressional Spice.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Signing of peace pact should not be sold short.
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   And now for the hard part, so only a muted and brief huzzah,
please, for the agreement that was pulled, like a molar with roots
of steel, from the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations at Wye River.
</P>
<P>
   These relatively modest gains in the Oslo process took 19 months
of public dithering and nine days of closeted head-knocking to
cobble together. Imagine the difficulty of composing the end-game
issues _ final boundaries, the nature of a Palestinian state,
Palestinian refugee rights, the status of Jerusalem, water.
</P>
<P>
   Still, though the achievements of recent days shouldn't be
over-sold, neither should they be sold short.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement adds solid blocks to the foundation for further
talks _ new assurances and means for Israeli security and
significant additional land concessions to the Palestinians. The
symbolic gestures matter, too _ Israel's release of Palestinian
prisoners and the Yasser Arafat's pledge finally to see the
Palestinian National Charter scrubbed of its provision calling for
the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Count that concession by Arafat as the official end of the
fantasies that have plagued Palestinian policy long past the time
when they had become plainly untenable. Similarly, the signature of
the hang-back conservative government of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on the deal is another splash of cold water _ after
Netanyahu earlier gutted out Hebron's release _ on Israeli
fantasies of a return to ancient Samaria and Judea.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of wrapping up a final, permanent settlement by next
May, as Oslo calls for, are somewhere in the range of one in
whatever comes after a trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis by a large margin durably favor peace, but it likely
will take another election _ in 2000, if the tense Netanyahu
coalition hangs on that long _ to arrange a government that's able
to go th

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's strongman,
knows the playbook well.
</P>
<P>
   His first big performance was in Bosnia; his second has just
been completed in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The plot goes like this: As a divided West looks the other way,
create a crisis. Pursue your ends a little too harshly by
destroying a few too many villages, permitting one too many
massacres. Finally you catch Washington's attention. Then in a
grand gesture grant some concessions _ like allowing monitors on
the ground in Kosovo and NATO surveillance planes above.
</P>
<P>
   The climax: You are elevated to the position of indispensable
keeper of the peace; U.S. and NATO officials come to consult and
sometimes to scold. It all serves to pump you up in the eyes of
your own people, to whom you present yourself as their champion and
protector against hostile outsiders, namely the West, with which
you have just done a deal. As a result, you are guaranteed more
years in power as their autocratic ruler.
</P>
<P>
   In moments of candor, U.S. and European diplomats describe
Milosevic's behavior in the last eight months in Kosovo in this
neat sequence. They know, they say, that by offering some
face-saving concessions to NATO _ which despite its bravado has
been reluctant to carry out the air strikes that it continues to
threaten _ Milosevic has outfoxed the West once again.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president was allowed to make a mess in Kosovo over
the summer when the West was on vacation and when there was concern
that getting tough with him might disturb elections in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath _ 250,000 refugees, burnt villages and
irrevocably ruined relations between ethnic Albanians and Serbs in
Kosovo _ the United States is left with the cleanup. Washington
will foot a big portion of the bill for an expected 2,000
international monitors, and for much of the aid for refugees. Some
put the total price at $500 million _ a lot for an underdeveloped,
rural province about the size of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons, of course, beyond the crises he creates
that make Milosevic the man to deal with in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, he has been the master manipulator of
Serbian politics, and his political machine remains in firm control
of the state-run press and broadcast media. Whatever horror
officials in Washington express about his appeals to crude
nationalism, it is depressingly clear that he has a lot of material
to work with when he stirs ethnic passions: a distrustful culture
built on long-held sagas of martyrdom.
</P>
<P>
   But to the West, Milosevic goes out of his way to present
himself as less extreme than some others. To prove the point, he
has chosen as his coalition partner Vojislav Seselj, who is even
more of a nationalist and who has led a charge against ``traitors''
in the independent media and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, does the West really have to play Milosevic's game? Is it
time to think about whether _ and how _ he could be displaced as
Serbia's leader? These questions are being increasingly raised in
the aftermath of the Kosovo agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a policy review that emphasizes ways of
getting rid of Milosevic,'' said David Phillips, the executive
director of the International Conflict Resolution Program at
Columbia University and who visited Kosovo last month. ``To have to
go back to Belgrade while Milosevic holds court is no longer
tenable.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips says the United States can shape its policies so that
Milosevic is weakened, not strengthened, and he maintains that one
of the weakest chinks in Milosevic's armor is the existence of a
United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague. ``It is time for
Louise Arbour to make a move against Milosevic and other Yugoslav
officials,'' said Phillips, referring to the tribunal's chief
prosecutor. ``At this juncture there should be plenty of evidence
and eyewitnesses to crimes against humanity by forces under the
control of Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Many pro-Western Serbs in Belgrade who oppose the Milosevic
regime, like Srbobran Brankovic, a leading Serbian pollster, agree
that the possibility of prosecution at The Hague could be turned to
the West's advantage as it struggles to contain Milosevic's
ambitions. He said a major motivation for Milosevic's agreement to
sign the Dayton agreement on Bosnia three years ago was his
calculation that, as a guarantor of the peace, he would not be made
a target of the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has an abnormal fear of the tribunal,'' the Serbian
pollster said. ``People in his circle said that when it was first
mentioned that he might be tried in The Hague, that he was in a
panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's popularity at home is not quite what it is
advertised abroad. His personal approval rating in Serbia has slid
from a high of 40 percent in the early 1990s to 20 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   Mr Brankovic and other pro-Western Serbs say they are not
persuaded by the argument that the only alternative to Milosevic is
Seselj, who enjoys about a 16 percent approval rating. There are,
he says, substantial independent voices of moderation that need to
be encouraged in Serbia's universities, in its independent media,
in its trade unions and mong its few struggling entrepreneurs _
even in the army.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who relies on the Interior Ministry's well-paid
police force to protect him and to repress opponents, is not well
liked in the Yugoslav Army; it is underpaid and has lost all the
battles that he sent it into in the last eight years. This feeling
was surprisingly evident in remarks last week by the army's chief
of staff, Gen. Momcilo Perisic, who rose through the ranks during
the glory days of Marshal Tito.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many leadership members have subjected everything to their own
interests,'' Perisic said in what seemed a veiled reference to
Milosevic. ``The Serbs have been at war since 1991 and we still
don't have an ally. We were never this isolated and we were never
without allies.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   How to capitalize on these signs of dissatisfaction is the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   In many quarters in the West, the notion of lightening the
financial and investment sanctions that have been placed on Serbia
is heresy, a sign of caving in to Milosevic. But educated Serbs who
would like to see Milosevic disappear argue that the sanctions
actually play into his hands by allowing him to argue that the
wicked West is responsible for a catastrophic drop in living
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions also encourage a pirate economy in which a tight
circle of Milosevic cronies get all the spoils. And barriers to
international travel fall especially hard on Western-oriented
Serbs, rather than on Milosevic's rural supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But given the West's pattern of letting Milosevic play out his
hand, there is not much optimism among educated Serbs in Belgrade
that the game will change very soon. They note the three-year time
frame for the interim political status of Kosovo agreed to during
the negotiations with Holbrooke. ``He will say I'm the guarantor of
the peace and security in the region, and the West will say
`yes,''' said Brankovic.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats in the Western embassies here are more cynically
optimistic, however. They point out that instead of operating on a
land-for-peace concept, Milosevic operates on a land-for-power
principle. Thus, he gave up his fight for Slovenia, then Croatia,
then Bosnia, but retained power as leader of a truncated Yugoslavia
dominated by Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   In time, given the realities in Kosovo, where the majority
ethnic Albanians are struggling for independence, he will also lose
Kosovo, these diplomats say. Montenegro could follow, if Milosevic
chooses to provoke a crisis there. At that rate, Milosevic is
likely one day to wind up king of a suburb of Belgrade, still in
power but of no relevance to the United States.

 HUSTLING FOR TIPS ON THE `WAITRESS MOMS'  
(The Week in Review) 
(DUPLICATION WARNING: Also sent with ``p'' code) 
(bl) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ One of the bellwethers for next month's
elections is taking milkshake orders from a late-night party of 25
in the Tastee Diner here _ all separate checks, she notes, with a
sort of kindly grimace.
</P>
<P>
   No, says the waitress, Carol Chavez, with enviable patience, she
was not previously aware that she is a member of the hot political
swing group of the moment, the ``waitress moms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just been trying to raise my kids,'' she says. ``I work
two jobs, so I don't listen to any of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like ``angry white men'' and ``soccer moms'' before them,
waitress moms are said to be the group to watch in the elections
this year. They are low-income working women _ not just those who
wait tables _ and are mostly white and under 50 with a high school
education.
</P>
<P>
   And while they may be Democrats at heart, they tend to sit out
elections when they don't see the political debate as relevant to
their families.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal involving President Clinton seems to have troubled a
good number of them, pollsters have said. And now no one knows if
they'll turn out on Nov. 3 _ or how they'll vote if they do show
up.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chavez, who turns 50 on Tuesday, says she, for one, won't
vote, or even tune into the debate. She has children aged 9, 15 and
19, and everything she's got goes into providing for them.
</P>
<P>
   Her co-worker, Janet Pochon, a 41-year-old mother of three
handing out burgers at a pretty good clip, is a lifelong Democrat
who twice voted for Bill Clinton but will also be staying home this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just really depressed with everything that's going on with
Clinton and it's really turned me off,'' she said. At what moment
did the Democrats lose her? ``When Clinton admitted he lied,'' Ms.
Pochon said. ``You put your trust in somebody and they break that
trust. I'm sure there are a lot of people just like me.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, of course, is the Democrats' biggest fear, and the
reason women like Ms. Pochon and Ms. Chavez are so sought after by
both parties this year.
</P>
<P>
   Celinda Lake, the Democratic pollster who coined the term
waitress moms in 1996, said she dreamed it up in an effort to
remind Democrats of the importance of the voters down market from
the soccer mom. ``I was trying to think: What's the downscale
version of the soccer moms _ the women who don't have a minivan and
a cleaning lady and have to take their kids to their mother's house
at 4 in the morning on their way to work?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're values oriented,'' Ms. Lake said. ``They think the
president has done a good job, but they're troubled by his personal
life. They've been swung back and forth by events, so they're a
question mark.''
</P>
<P>
   And they seem to be a newly volatile factor in the gender gap,
the tendency of women to vote heavily Democratic, which has helped
President Clinton in the past. In this midterm election, in which a
lower-than-normal turnout could hurt Democrats, the waitress moms
are more important than ever, and more unpredictable. So the term
has stuck this year, with these women symbolizing the ambivalence
and uncertainty of a strange political season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are doubts about Ms. Lake's catchy phrase: Is it
mostly a marketing buzz phrase designed to motivate Democrats? Has
it caught on merely as a way for political reporters to enjoy an
order of fries on the job while interviewing the female equivalent
of the much-quoted taxi driver? And is it even a good way to sum up
working-class women? (When these women are asked to describe
themselves, Ms. Lake said, their No. 1 response is ``tired.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate the term _ waitress moms is a little derogatory,'' says
Stephanie Cohen, spokeswoman for Emily's List, the women's advocacy
group whose own pollster, Ms. Lake, made it up. (Ms. Cohen prefers
``drop-off women.'' And no, that doesn't refer to the mothers
queued up in the parking lot to let their kids out at the school
door, but to the fact that low-income women are less likely to vote
in off-year elections.)
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kohut, an independent pollster for the Pew Research
Center for the People and the Press, says the new formulation
mostly fills the need for political theater and good visuals.
``This comes from focus groups as the new political insider's
wisdom, and it's a myth,'' he said, adding that he sees no evidence
that these women are any more or less likely to vote this year than
in any off-year.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is only one way to describe one of many voting
blocs that could be crucial to this or any other election. But both
parties seem to be taking the waitress-moms concept seriously,
targeting the group heavily with mailings and advertising campaigns
that emphasize resonant themes like education, social security and
the reform of health-maintenance organizations. The AFL-CIO is
sponsoring 2,000 events with them in mind, mostly small gatherings
to be held in kitchens and job sites all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen said polling shows that this group is turned off by
heavy partisanship and is almost solely focused on practical
questions like, ``Can I pick my own doctor?''
</P>
<P>
   And these days, the waitress moms seem more favorably disposed
to Hillary Rodham Clinton than to her husband. Ms. Lake said that
in a recent poll in a Southern border state she would not name, 46
percent of them said they liked the president. That's compared with
the 64 percent who felt an affinity for the first lady. Mrs.
Clinton has been campaigning heavily, and signed a letter that
Emily's List sent to many of the 2 million waitress moms targeted
by the group.
</P>
<P>
   But just getting these women to the polls is only part of the
challenge for Democrats, said Garry South, campaign director for
Gray Davis, the Democratic candidate for governor of California.
South warned that efforts to pursue this group will backfire on
candidates who try to win over waitress moms without knowing them
well enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a subset of what's come to be known as the Reagan
Democrats, who vote Democrat but will desert you in a second if
something doesn't smell right,'' he said. ``They're fickle,
frustrated and hard to fathom, and Democrats cannot simply turn out
waitress moms through a get-out-the-vote campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Allen County Republican Party's annual bean dinner in
Fort Wayne, Ind., on Friday night, the featured speaker, former
Vice President Dan Quayle, said Republicans were the waitress moms'
true friends. ``Think of the waitress that works extra hours at
night so she can buy a book for her child,'' he told the crowd.
``She might want to be at her son or daughter's soccer game, but
she has to work because of high taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of Republicans are running advertising campaigns
emphasizing education and other matters of particular interest to
these women.
</P>
<P>
   And both parties seem to see waitress moms wagging a finger at
them, warning that they won't be ignored this year.
</P>
<P>
   That image, and the whole metaphor of the waitress mom, ``is
somewhat an oversimplification,'' South admitted. ``But it's a
useful way to characterize for the Democrats why you have to pay
attention to someone other than the soccer mom.''

 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Maybe it was just a false dawn _ there have been
plenty of those.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Dow Jones industrial average rose, the final touches
were put on a $30 billion package to prop up Brazil, and Japan
committed a half a trillion dollars to save its banks, there was
hope last week that the worst of the global financial upheaval
might be passing.
</P>
<P>
   The case for optimism goes like this: Investors may be realizing
that their panicky race for the exits, into Treasury bonds and
anything else that seems secure, was as much an overreaction as
their rush into the world's emerging markets in the mid-1990s was a
triumph of blind optimism.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the interest-rate cuts pulled off by the Federal
Reserve in recent weeks show that someone is paying attention.
Interest rates in Thailand and South Korea have fallen to 7
percent, evidence that their economies may finally get going. Sure,
Indonesia has turned into a lawless land, with mobs burning out the
shops of ethnic Chinese merchants and chopping off the heads of
suspected sorcerers, but its currency, the rupiah, is making a
surprising comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Commerce Department's announcement last week of a
mammoth August trade deficit for the United States, $16.77 billion,
was greeted by the markets as good news: America remains the last
big-time consumer on the globe, the numbers showed, and projections
that the 1999 trade deficit could hit $300 billion for the year
suggests the United States will keep consuming. In other words,
even as America's growth slows, it may pull Asia and Japan out of
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there were plenty of optimists around in the spring,
declaring that the sky had stopped falling. That was just before
Russia defaulted on its debts and backtracked on its commitments to
economic reform. And it was when Japan's troubles still seemed
limited to $600 billion in bad bank loans, instead of more than $1
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a long time for these problems to develop, and it will
take a long time for the world to work through them,'' Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin cautioned last week. Meanwhile, his aides
are explaining what fundamentally good shape Brazil is in, which
must explain why it is about to become the fifth country to receive
a multi-billion rescue package in the past year.

   1. WELCOME TO EUROLAND Over the long and frantic New Year's
weekend in 10 weeks time, 11 European countries will take a deep
breath, join hands in monetary fashion and leap into the future,
gambling that, yoked together in a new currency, they can all live
better. It's euro time. In Euroland. It could be fractious Europe's
greatest achievement. Or, it could be a colossal mistake that
beggars millions, endangers the political compact and robs
precarious regimes of the power to work their own way out of
recessions by juggling money supply or interest rates. What is
undeniable is that France, Germany, Italy and eight other countries
- but not Britain - are gambling that they can generally do better
together than alone. By David Nyhan. From The Boston Globe
Magazine. Full-length (3,900 words) + edited article available. 2.

   The Taliban hard-liners who rule most of Afghanistan are
arguably the world's most vociferous enemies of modern technology.
When they aren't busy enforcing the rules that prohibit females
from leaving their homes unveiled or unaccompanied by a close male
relative, the Taliban religious police roam neighborhoods searching
for radios, TVs, VCRs, phonographs, satellite dishes or computers,
which are promptly destroyed while the owners are arrested.
</P>
<P>
   What a surprise, then, to go online, type in ``www.taliban.com''
and witness what spills forth: Taliban Online, a profusion of
graphics and text (in awkward English) employing the most modern
communications tool _ the Internet _ to extol the virtues and
triumphs of the least modern of regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Here are excerpts from the site, which appears to originate in
Pakistan and is evidently designed for external use only. _ By JOE
SHARKEY
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Among Taliban Online features are news
summaries from the pages of the unofficial Taliban weekly
newspaper, Dharb-i-Mumin, which chronicles efforts to enforce
sharia, or Islamic law, in Afghanistan. Some recent items: (END

   Drive of Kandahar Police Against Antisocial Elements: The
Kandahar police, in a drive against antisocial elements yesterday,
rounded up different criminals from around the city. They arrested
a man and seized ... 240 song cassettes and packs of playing cards
from his possessions. All the things were then set on fire while
the culprit was handed over to the police. _ Oct. 4
</P>
<P>
   Televisions Seized and Smashed in Kabul: (The religious police)
have started their country-wide campaign of destroying televisions,
VCRs, satellite dishes, etc. ... On Tuesday, here in Kabul,
hundreds of television sets and other instruments of immoral
pastimes were seized from markets and work places and then
destroyed. These means of corruption were, in some places, even
thrown out of the windows of high buildings to smash on the streets
below. A source revealed that the campaign will be carried on with
the same fervor and zeal till the complete destruction of these
instruments of moral depravity. _ Aug. 9
</P>
<P>
   Kabul: 16 Punished for Trimming Beard: (The religious police)
arrested 16 people in raids on different parts of the city, on the
charge of having their beard trimmed to less than the required
length. Two taxi drivers were also arrested for taking unattended,
unveiled women as passengers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Aug. 2
</P>
<P>
   Punishment on Trimming Beard and Keeping Un-Islamic Hairstyle:
The religious police ... arrested several people in different
crimes during several raids in different parts of the city. They
arrested and gave sharia punishment to 13 shopkeepers for not
offering congregational prayers. ... Similarly, dozens of people
were (given) punishment for trimming their beards. ... Meanwhile,
the religion police gave hard sharia punishment to three taxi
drivers who had allowed (unescorted) women to sit in their taxis
(and) issued an order according to which no women could go to the
doctor even for medicine (unless accompanied by a male relative).
Similarly, some private schools for women were also ordered to be
closed which were open in homes. ... According to an official of
the religious police ... some weak elements were trying to pave way
for indecency and dissension among women under cover of education;
therefore, all such schools have been ordered to close down.
</P>
<P>
   _ July 19
</P>
<P>
   Liquor Seized at Kabul International Airport: A large amount of
liquor was seized from Kabul International Airport. This liquor was
being smuggled by the officials of an international welfare
organization from Islamabad (Pakistan) to Kabul, when it was seized
by Taliban security forces. Later liquor is burnt in fire. ...
Previously also, liquor bottles were recovered from the officers of
Red Cross International organization during search at Kabul
airport.
</P>
<P>
   _ July 26
</P>
<P>
   Three Dozen Shopkeepers Punished: (government agents) punished
three dozen shopkeepers for not offering congregational prayers in
Kabul. The accused were also ordered to keep their shops closed for
five days. Whereas, 25 persons were punished for trimming their
beards and 12 taxi drivers were given sharia punishment for dealing
with women and for listening (to) songs.
</P>
<P>

   Prohibition of TV, VCR Essential to Save Society from
Destruction: An edict was issued by (the religious police) ordering
the destruction or disposal of all TV sets, VCRs, videocassettes,
etc., in the country within 15 days. ``No one is allowed to keep
these things in their home or shops. Selling or dealing in such
goods is strictly prohibited from now on. Restriction is imposed
upon mechanics of corruption and depravity,'' the order maintained.
</P>
<P>
   (In an interview), the deputy head of the Taliban's religious
ministry said that they had no other option to cleanse the society
of corruption and moral depravity. ``We had banned all televisions,
videocassette recorders, videos, satellite dishes, audio cassettes
of recorded songs and music from the country when we took control.
But the ban had not been strictly imposed and, taking advantage of
our leniency, people are watching TV in their homes. So we have
decided to remedy this.''

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Not all is grim policy and severe
punishment, however. The web site also has a pointed reminder from
the publisher of Dharb-i-Mumin to subscribers around the world who
might be tardy in sending in that subscription-renewal check: (END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The enemies of Islam cannot tolerate the existence of
Dharb-i-Mumin even for a moment. So those ... who have become
subscribers of Dharb-i-Mumin and pay their bills on time deserve
congratulations. We are sure that by remitting the outstanding dues
at the earliest possible moment, you will help in foiling the
conspiracies of the enemies of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Taliban Online visitors can also
double-click on scores of sites with titles like ``Why Women Should
Stay in Their Homes.'' Banning women from schools, the workplace
and even the streets prompted the government of Iran (no slacker
when it comes to keeping women undercover) to protest recently that
the Taliban are ``giving Islam a bad name.'' In a series of
rhetorical questions and answers, the Taliban addressed such
concerns at length: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Q. The Taliban use force in the enforcement of Islamic law.
Their haste in implementing sharia is discrediting Islam in the
eyes of the world. Shouldn't they have implemented it gradually,
step by step?
</P>
<P>
   A. The Taliban have put a ban on wine, on the immorality of TV,
a complete restriction on songs, photography or painting of living
things. Shaving off the beard or trimming it less than a fistful is
prohibited too, as is adopting an English hairstyle. Gambling,
betting, pigeon-flying, dog-racing, sodomy are strictly forbidden.
... When Islam has forbidden them and the Taliban have banned them,
would it be called cruelty _ (this) use of force? To call it so
would be criticizing Islam, and criticizing Islam leads to going
astray.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The U.N., America, Britain, in fact the entire Western media
accuse the Taliban of violating the rights of women, of banning
them from jobs, of ordering them to observe ``purdah'' (a
requirement that women's faces and legs be covered when in public).
The Taliban are also accused of depriving women of their right to
education.
</P>
<P>
   A. Neither do we acknowledge the rights given to women by the
West, nor are we bound by them. ... Men in the West have made women
an object of their lusts and desires. They have used them (as) they
pleased. When these slaves-of-their-desires had to go to work, to
offices and factories, they drafted the women along with them also.
Women were made to work in offices, restaurants, shops and
factories for the gratification of (male) desires. In this way did
the Western man destroy the personality, position and identity of a
woman. ...
</P>
<P>
   The women of the West are laboring under a double burden. One,
she is torn by anxiety as to who will look after her in case she
remains unmarried. ... She is thus forced to wander from door to
door in search of security. Even in the matter of dress she is
exploited. Men wear trousers which cover their ankles, while women
are forced to wear skirts with their legs bare in every kind of
weather. In the scantiest of dresses, merely a sleeveless blouse
and miniskirt, the Western woman can be seen roaming in shops,
airports, stations, etc. She is a target for unscrupulous men who
satisfy their lust with them _ wherever, whenever they please. ...
She has become no less than a bitch, chased by a dozen dogs in
heat. If these are the rights of the Western women, then the West
is welcome to them.

   In Time for Elections, A New Federal Budget
</P>
<P>
   After a grueling labor, Congress delivered a 40-pound,
16-inch-high monster, otherwise known as the federal budget. It ran
3,825 pages, and hardly a man or woman alive had read the whole
thing before Congress passed it into law and President Clinton
signed it.
</P>
<P>
   The $500 billion omnibus package picked up all the loose ends of
the legislative year, including spending for eight broad categories
of the government. And it cemented into policy an array of
non-money matters that rank-and-file lawmakers had never debated or
voted on.
</P>
<P>
   If the process horrified people inside Congress and out, it
produced a package larded up with local goodies that lawmakers
could take home and boast about as they run for re-election.

   Suspicious Fires in Vail
</P>
<P>
   Skiers who visit Vail, Colo., often rate it the best ski area in
the nation. So the stakes seemed clear after a series of fires
there that destroyed a luxury restaurant, a picnic shelter and the
ski patrol headquarters on Vail Mountain _ all of the blazes
erupting in linear sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions immediately focused on the possibility of an act of
vengeance against Vail Resorts, a corporate giant resented by local
residents because it has been acquiring huge parts of the local ski
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Romer called the fires ``terrorism,'' and the FBI and
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were called in to
investigate, since the fires took place on U.S. Forest Service
land.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Apples; Give Teachers Stock
</P>
<P>
   The problem is this: how to make teaching a more prestigious
occupation, one that draws the best and the brightest. The Edison
Project, a privately held company that runs public schools around
the country, thinks it has an answer: Pay teachers like executives.
</P>
<P>
   Edison announced that it would give stock options and cash
bonuses to teachers at the elementary school it runs in Miami _ and
it plans to expand the program to its other 50 schools as well.
Teachers will be given $3,000 in options, the school principal
$10,500, and other staff $1,000, when fully vested after five
years. If Edison does well after it goes public in a couple of
years, the options could be worth more.
</P>
<P>
   That may not sound like much to top executives, who are used to
counting their compensation in the millions. But to teacher
representatives it is a start. Although other public schools will
have trouble offering shares of stock, teachers union officials say
it's about time some creative thinking went into teacher pay.

   Glenn Doesn't Strut The Old Stuff  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A recent lull in space shuttle launchings has raised quiet
concerns over the safety of Sen. John Glenn's flight, prompting an
unusual series of dry runs meant to keep ground crews sharp and
complex gear up to snuff. Safety experts agree that the winged
spaceships must run regularly or become balky and their launching
crews rusty.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Glenn himself seems a bit fragile and has been
dropped from one of the main age-related inquiries planned for his
return to space, set for Thursday. For a study of how melatonin can
promote sleep, he failed to meet one of the medical criteria; just
which one was undisclosed for reasons of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   On the mechanical side, safety experts give NASA high marks for
looking potential trouble in the eye. It was hiding from problems
that led to the 1986 Challenger explosion, in which six astronauts
and a high school teacher died.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get into something that is extraordinary, everybody
has to be made aware of that fact and to do the job right,'' noted
Dr. Seymour Himmel, a safety adviser to NASA.

fighter's boxing license, 15 months after he bit both ears of
Evander Holyfield, the heavyweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blew my cool,'' Tyson said simply.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of his unpredictability in the ring, Tyson
remains one of the sport's biggest draws. Last month he underwent
psychological tests, which concluded that the fighter suffered from
depression and anger but was mentally fit to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is hoping to fight soon. His lawyers say the IRS has
placed a $13 million lien against his three homes.

   Pipeline Blast Kills 48 In Colombia

province.
</P>

   Senator Blocks a Nomination of a homosexual

   A Little Respect For the Commander in Chief
</P>
<P>
   By now in the Lewinsky matter, there is very little bad that has
not been said about President Clinton. Already the butt of
late-night television jokes and talk-radio scorn, his reputation
took a new drubbing in Minnesota when Paula Jones' appeal of her
dismissed sexual-harassment lawsuit rehashed some of the more
sordid accusations.
</P>
<P>
   In one place, though, the president still gets respect _ or
else. The Uniform Code of Military Justice prohibits members of the
Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines from making ``contemptuous
remarks'' in public about the president. A Marine major now faces
investigation and, possibly, punishment for writing a newspaper
article disparaging Clinton as an ``adulterous liar.'' Worried
about a rash of ventings, the Marine Corps and Air Force reminded
troops that when it comes to the commander in chief, it's ``Mr.
President, SIR!''

   Numerical Lunacy (Cont.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How big is a googolplex? A brief article last Sunday _ one that
invited readers on a wild ride through the world of really, really
big numbers _ presumed to answer that question in a down-to-earth,
lay-'em-end-to-end sort of way. ``Write the numeral 1 followed by a
letter-sized page of zeros,'' it suggested innocently. ``Continue
writing zeros until you have a stack of paper that reaches the
moon.''
</P>
<P>
   The expected reactions:
</P>
<P>
   1) Whew! That's a lot of zeros!
</P>
<P>
   2) Or, from pickier types: How thick is the paper? How big are
the zeros? Full moon or new? Wouldn't you get writer's cramp? Do
you start at sea level, or on top of one of Donald Trump's towers?
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, that vivid little image was wrong. Very, very wrong,
as a handful (an imprecise number far, far smaller than a
googolplex) of readers rushed to point out.
</P>
<P>
   One writer, a math and computer science professor, ridiculed the
lunar in-basket as having a measly 15 quadrillion zeros. Another,
after offering his own calculation, wrote, ``Even if you could
stack paper up to the edge of the known universe, it still wouldn't
be enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another: ``Your article points to the need to teach many
`educated' people to understand numbers (and our universe) just a
wee bit better.''
</P>
<P>
   And a final letter, after noting that in the universe ``there is
not even a sufficient amount of matter available to write out a
googol's worth of zeroes,'' concludes, ``Thankfully, there is no
need to.''
</P>
<P>
   So how big is a googolplex? Get out some paper, start writing
zeros, and do it, well, pretty much forever.

   The Yankees (and Baseball) Win &QL;
</P>
<P>
   David Cone, the veteran pitcher, found himself hoarding
newspapers after the New York Yankees ended their extraordinary
season with a World Series sweep of the San Diego Padres. ``I'm
curious to see what everyone is saying about us and how we stack
up'' in history, Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Yankees are arguably the best team ever. They
accumulated a record of 125 victories (against 50 losses) in the
regular season and postseason. More to the point, they played with
a unique intensity and respect for their opponents, taking nothing
for granted in a season of many twists.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells pitched a perfect game May 17. Bernie Williams won a
batting title. Cone won 20 games. And Orlando (El Duque) Hernandez
emerged as a frontline pitcher less than six months after defecting
from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the first round of the playoffs, the slugger Darryl
Strawberry was found to have colon cancer. So his teammates had his
number, 39, embroidered on the backs of their caps as they blitzed
to the 24th championship in Yankee history. The owner, George
Steinbrenner, and the manager, Joe Torre, were moved to tears when
they won, and Derek Jeter and others called Strawberry at his New
Jersey home, screaming happily to him on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   It was a stirring conclusion to a season that saw Mark McGwire
and Sammy Sosa break the 37-year-old home run record, allowing fans
nationwide to share in a rebirth of baseball.

   The morning of the 1997 New York City Marathon, Jerod Neas
jumped in a car with his parents in Princeton, N.J., drove to

26.2-mile commute through the city's five boroughs.

   At 5 feet 9 inches and 130 pounds, Neas could not muscle his way

fighting to get on a crowded subway train. So he started 15 or 20
rows back and found himself sprinting to cover the first mile in 5
minutes 40 seconds. After two miles, he was already fading into the
rearview mirror of the lead pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running as fast as I could,'' the 27-year-old Neas
recalled. ``It's a tough thing to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   The best he could hope for was to find someone else running the
same pace and willing to work together. Neas kept at it, and
between Miles 23 and 24, when the race entered the hills of Central
Park, he passed the favored American, Mark Coogan, who had been an
Olympian a year earlier in Atlanta but was now drained and fading.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching the finish line in 2 hours 19 minutes 7 seconds, Neas
finished 15th over all and first among the Americans. But there are
few things as obscure as being first among the Americans in an
international marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Neas finished nearly 11 minutes behind the winner, John Kagwe of
Kenya. He was so little known that there was even confusion about
his nationality. Was he American or French? By the time reporters
caught up to him, Neas had already returned home to Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field wasn't packed with Americans,'' Neas said. ``I was
more pleased with where I finished than being the first American.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he will return for a fourth shot at New York, hoping
to lower his time and raise his place in the standing. Neas knows
he cannot win, but he hopes that incremental improvement now might
lead to a breakthrough later. He is following a solitary,
unorthodox plan toward making the United States team for the 2000
Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Even among American runners, Neas remains in the shadows, a
virtual unknown. He ranks in the second half of the second tier of
American marathoners, with a personal best of 2:16:20. That is 10
minutes off the world record of 2:06:05 held by Ronaldo da Costa of
Brazil and nearly eight minutes short of the American record of
2:08:47 set by Bob Kempainen.
</P>
<P>
   Neas largely avoids the road-racing circuit, has no coach and
does no track work. He is committed to marathons, six or seven a
year, when most elite runners compete in only two. In 1996, Neas
ran nine marathons because he needed the prize money to make ends
meet.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 4, he ran the Twin Cities Marathon in Minneapolis (he
finished sixth). New York will follow four weeks later. If he is
going to put in all this mileage, about 120 miles a week, if he is
going to run this hard and this fast, he figures it might as well
be in a race.
</P>
<P>
   But this kind of racing regimen is likely to leave him watching
the Olympics on television instead of in person. So Neas plans to
reduce his races next year as he aims toward the Olympic trials in
2000. Eight months ago, a vitamin company began endorsing him,
picking up his expenses. And for a year now, he has lived in the
Denver suburbs, training in the mile-high altitude, hoping to
increase his oxygen-carrying capacity. His wife, Julie, a
controller for a building company, has moved to the Rockies with
him, willing to make adjustments in her career for his.
</P>
<P>
   His Olympic chances are remote but not impossible. American
marathoning is in a deep funk. Kempainen has retired to become a
doctor, and his successors, Coogan, Keith Brantly and Jerry Lawson,
have not converted potential into achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 10 guys have a legitimate shot if they can bring down
their times and run more consistently,'' Neas said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Neas will receive no special treatment, except a
chance to start nearer the front and a shot to win $5,000 as the
first local runner. The race offers $100,000 to an American winner,
double the prize money, but officials are reluctant to pay
appearance fees for what has become repeated failure. An American
man has not won in New York since Alberto Salazar in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome Americans, but we're not going to pay someone
$10,000 in appearance money to run 2:20,'' said Allan Steinfeld,
the race director.
</P>
<P>
   Neas said he understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've earned very much respect,'' Neas said.
``It's got to be earned.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He began running as a high school junior, when his family moved
to Princeton from Clearwater, Fla. He ran in college at Penn and
then at North Carolina, where Neas received a degree in 1994. After
school, he bunked at home, lived race to race, getting by on meager
prize money and determined to live the lonely life of the
long-distance runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love getting out in nature and running,'' Neas said.
``If you don't do well, you don't have anyone to blame but
yourself. It has nothing to do with luck. Usually, the best runner
wins. What makes it great is that it's so difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he ran his first marathon, in Atlantic City. He had
planned to run a half-marathon, but prize money was offered only
for first place, and Kagwe was entered in the shorter race, so Neas
decided he had better run a full marathon. He did, and won in 2:19.
Four weeks later, he entered New York, emboldened with victory, but
he hit the wall at Mile 15 and struggled home in 2:27.
</P>
<P>
   ``That taught me never to be cocky going into a marathon,'' Neas
said.
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Kiele, an investment banker, and his father, Harold,
a certified public accountant, have run marathons, inspired by his
own running. But his mother, Donna, said she thought the idea was
crazy and feared that her son would ``fall into a shamble of
bones'' by the age of 32.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he runs, chasing an Olympic dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is an opportunity to run with the best in the world,
to compare where you really are,'' Neas said. ``It's like an
Olympic race. Everyone who is anyone runs New York eventually. It
brings me back to reality, keeps me honest.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Generations at war over economic pie
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week, when astronaut John Glenn straps himself into the
shuttle Discovery, younger Americans will marvel at the
achievements of this 77-year-old hero.
</P>
<P>
   He's been a combat pilot, space pioneer, political leader and
family man. He embodies the best about his gritty generation, the
one that triumphed in World War II and then built the world's
greatest economy.
</P>
<P>
   But don't let the glowing descriptions you'll hear from young TV
reporters lead you to believe that goodwill toward older Americans
is universal. Despite the family ties that bind us, the different
generations seem to be growing apart as jealousy and economic
conflict drive wedges between the various age groups.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of Glenn's generation believe they are losing
ground financially now. At the same time, their children are
getting sick of paying high taxes to support Social Security. And
Generation Xers are afraid the baby boomers ahead of them soon will
create such a huge voting bloc of retirees that Congress will be
pushed to further boost taxes to support the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Each generation has some legitimate gripes and fears. Today's
over-65 Americans are frustrated because they are seeing their
income decline at a time when younger people are flourishing. While
jobs are plentiful and mortgages cheap for workers in the prime of
life, retirees are getting pinched by a meager 1.3 percent
cost-of-living increase in Social Security payments and a
continuing decline in the interest rates paid on savings.
</P>
<P>
   With their incomes stagnant or shrinking, many older Americans
are getting angry with their children. They resent seeing younger
generations buying bigger homes and cars. ``I've never known a more
self-indulgent, self-absorbed, self-centered generation as the baby
boomers,'' one reader said in a recent letter to me.
</P>
<P>
   A jealous 69-year-old parent wrote: ``My first home had 1,200
square feet. My daughter's home today is over 3,000, as are most of
the homes being built in north Fulton, where I still have a tiny,
one-story ranch home with wood siding.''
</P>
<P>
   But while senior citizens are complaining about ``selfish''
children, boomers are getting fed up with the kvetching of their
parents, who are getting far more out of Social Security than they
put into it. In the 1950s, the combined payroll tax for Social
Security, paid by both workers and their employers, was just 6
percent. Today, the combined tax is 12.4 percent. The World War II
generation had nowhere near the tax burden that today's workers
carry to fund benefits for aging veterans, Social Security,
Medicare and other programs for the elderly. Largely because of
that government aid, the elderly are the wealthiest demographic
group in America.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps no generation has more to fear from their elders
than Generation X, the people born from the mid-1960s to the late
1970s. Those young workers are vastly outnumbered by the boomers
who were born between 1946 and 1964.
</P>
<P>
   GenXers may find themselves suffocated by much higher taxes to
care for long-living boomers. Economists estimate that to maintain
today's level of Social Security benefits, workers in 2020 will
have to shoulder a 20 percent payroll tax.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Congress is supposed to take up Social Security reform.
The arguments could get very ugly as each generation tries to cut a
better deal for itself. For decades, the most bitter battles in
American social and political life were over race. In coming years,
the most hostile debates may be over what one generation owes
another.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions around the table at Thanksgiving may get a lot
livelier in the next century.

 &HT;    Action Files carries on tradition
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the early days of Apple Computer, Now Utilities was
among the most successful and innovative enhancers of the software
that gave the Mac its distinct look and feel.
</P>
<P>
   Now Utilities was so successful Apple Computer added many of its
innovations to the Mac operating system. Things such as
point-and-click navigation through folders, hierarchical pop-up
menus and lists of recently used files and folders began with Now
Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere in the mid-1990s Now Utilities lost its way. It
failed to come up with new innovations and has not released a
version compatible with OS 8.
</P>
<P>
   The company was sold a couple of times and finally ended up in
the hands of a hot new upstart, Power On Software. Power On is
updating Now Utilities and incorporating it into its own popular
Action Files Software.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Action Files is the modern day successor to Now in
both function and spirit. It's a simple but powerful enhancement to
the Mac's open and save dialogue box.
</P>
<P>
   That's the window that pops up anytime you highlight and release
the open command in any menu. It lists files by name and lets you
navigate through a file or folder to a particular item.
</P>
<P>
   Action Files, like Now's SuperBoomerang utility, greatly
enhances this window. For starters, it adds a menu bar with lots of
new headings along the top. Those headings include not only a
file's name but also the size, kind, label and modification date.
</P>
<P>
   You can also sort files in this window, turn off column headings
and resize an Action File's window, something you can't do in the
Mac OS.
</P>
<P>
   But the best part of Action Files is its navigational tools. It
lets you save in a list your favorite files and folders. Just
highlight the item you want to add to your favorites list and hit
the space bar.
</P>
<P>
   The item now appears every time under either the document or
folder heading in the menu bar. To jump to any particular item,
just highlight it in the menu. This is a great timesaver.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find Action Files all over the Internet, from which a
trial copy can be downloaded. Among the sites are http://www
</P>
<P>
   .actionutilities.com and http://www5.zdnet.com/mac, the Mac
homepage of ZDNet.
</P>
<P>
   The price of Action Files is $39.95 for a downloaded version and
$49.95 for a CD version.

 &HT;    Don't believe everything you read _ love is still alive
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio. _ It's an early, sweats and two pairs of
socks, fall morning.
</P>
<P>
   The sun hasn't yet hit the eastern limits of our village as I
stand over the stove watching for the first bubble to hit the glass
bulb in the top of a battered, second-hand percolator. The morning
paper is under my arm. These are the bittersweet, pre-dawn hours I
favor for writing, when the day's potential remains an unknown and
when anything is possible. They are also the loneliest.
</P>
<P>
   The cats and I sit down to breakfast. Stella, the 14-year-old
shy one, mews for her butter dish. It's the unsalted stuff in a
covered bowl with seashells on the top. Biddy, a mouthy,
10-year-old Siamese, only wants to chat. She doesn't like butter. I
flip open the paper while the toast burns.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Arafat, and Netanyahu are cinching a peace agreement in
the Middle East. NATO warns Milosevic he faces air strikes if he
doesn't withdraw from Kosovo, and in Tennessee, a loose cannon
political wannabe who legally changed his middle name to `Low Tax'
has been arrested on charges of murdering his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Page three doesn't get much better. There's the predictable
campaign analyses: He says she's all talk and no action. She says
he doesn't listen. Sounds more like marriage than politics.
</P>
<P>
   A meat processor in Florida has had to recall 100,000 pounds of
wieners because of possible listeria contamination. I don't know
what that is, but I make a mental note to lay off hot dogs for a
couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial page is a waste of time. Two rankled columnists
are holding forth on their favorite soap boxes, battering readers
for the umpteenth time on the injustices of discrimination (we
already know this, ladies), and a report from the Washington Post
grimly informs me that Congress has hacked the guts out of an
environmental bill.
</P>
<P>
   Lordy, isn't anybody feeling good today? Why can't we
occasionally read something that expands the heart and mellows the
outlook? The sun isn't even up yet and I'm thinking I'll go on out
back and eat dirt.
</P>
<P>
   In a snit, I throw the paper onto the floor - its figurative
last mile before the recycling bin - and contemplate the dark
outside the breakfast room window. But a little voice (not really,
but I don't know what else to call it) tells me not to give up.
Maybe the comics will help.
</P>
<P>
   They don't, but a brief blurb buried on one of the back pages
snags my eye. During an interview with BBC radio, ex-Beatle Paul
McCartney is described as coming close to tears as he talked about
how hard life is without his late wife. ``We fancied each other
something rotten. To me, she was always still my girlfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   To the American eye, the syntax is awkward and the slang
unfamiliar, but the meaning comes quickly clear. A man and his wife
were in love. She's gone. He misses her. Uncomplicated. Eloquent. A
touching epitaph.
</P>
<P>
   It reminds me that love is still good and a lot of everyday
folks in the dark beyond my early morning windows are still feeling
it. It just shows up in odd shapes.
</P>
<P>
   To the widow a few houses down, love comes in remembered dance
music from the 40s. Takes her back to the post-war years she and
her then-new husband spent in
</P>
<P>
   a two-room apartment just outside Chicago's Loop. Weekends she
says they danced the night away at the Aragon Ballroom. Her
``honey'' as she called him has been
</P>
<P>
   gone for quite a while now but that hasn't stopped her missing
him. She says she'd give anything for just one more dance.
</P>
<P>
   To another neighbor it's the geraniums her husband plants for
her every spring. Fifteen times I've watched her smile as she
watches him dig. Later, they sit outside with coffee and survey
their private corner of the world. I probably shouldn't be
watching.
</P>
<P>
   Love to my father was a battered old skillet that my mother had
cooked his breakfast in for over fifty years. He tried using it a
couple of times after she was gone but said it had lost its temper.
</P>
<P>
   Love to my son is a phone call and a pizza with vegetables all
over it.
</P>
<P>
   And right now, as I pour myself a second cup of coffee, I'm
guessing that love can even look like this ancient, beat-up
percolator a friend sent me a while back with a note insisting that
because of the years it had served on board a boat and over
campfires in the Everglades, it made the best coffee yet.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the good news for today.

   With Power Stroke diesel,
</P>
<P>
   F-350 a titan of towing
</P>
<P>
   What makes a Ford F-350 such a heavenly towing vehicle, and why
would anyone consider a Crew Cab over an extended or SuperCab
edition?
</P>
<P>
   For me, the biggest reason to look at the Ford F-350 Super Duty
for towing is the option of the Power Stroke diesel engine. It is
only available on the F-350. I personally experienced almost 15 mpg
on a 4x4 version. Ever since, I have been curious as to how a 4x2
would fair.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, I chased down a guy driving an F-350 4x2 in a
parking lot. After I got him to quit grinning about his work truck,
he volunteered that pulling a 10,000-pound load intown, he got 14
mpg. We both agreed that out on the highway you could reasonably
expect to pick up at least two to three miles per gallon at a
minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from mileage, the Power Stroke diesel is a torque monster.
The 7.3-liter direct-injection power plant, while only rated at 235
horsepower, produces an incredible 500 foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer a Crew Cab configuration to an extended-cab pickup,
even though extended cabs are all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't have ``real'' rear doors. Most manufacturers have
two rear panels that open ``suicide'' fashion _ front to rear.
Regardless of what their marketing claims are, I have yet to find
an extended-cab truck in which I would want to ride in the rear
seat further than to dinner. If you are 10 or under, it might be
acceptable. There is inadequate legroom, the seat back is usually
too straight up and the seat bottom too short.
</P>
<P>
   I know you are already thinking those Crew Cabs are such
monstrous vehicles. But an F-350 4x2 SuperCab has a wheelbase of
158.0 inches; the Crew Cab counterpart when equipped with a short
bed is 156.2 inches; the long bed is 172.4 inches.
</P>
<P>
   It has been my experience that when you are driving something as
big as any of these trucks, 10 or 12 more inches is pretty much
academic.
</P>
<P>
   The real plus is in interior space and ease of entry and exit.
The SuperCab has 32.4 inches of rear legroom, while the Crew Cab
offers 42.5 inches. For comparison, a Lincoln Town Car has a
minimum of 41.1 inches. In the back seat of the F-350 Crew Cab, you
feel like you are in a concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   Extended-cab trucks have almost claustrophobic back seats. With
the Crew Cab you also get strategically positioned grab handles.
</P>
<P>
   My test F-350 was equipped with the Lariat package, which meant
full leather and all the bells and whistles. Having traveled more
than 7,000 miles in a Lincoln Navigator vs. about 3,000 in the
F-350, I found the ride quality of the F-350 superior. Most of that
can be attributed to the Navigator's 119-inch wheelbase vs. 172.4
in the F-350.
</P>
<P>
   The test F-350 was just under $40,000 with the $3,000 Power
Stroke and 4x4 options. Many dressed-out extended-cab 4x2 pick-ups
with gasoline motors can be close to that price.

 &HT;    Internet provides guide for ghouls
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is difficult to write about Halloween sites on the
World Wide Web without using any puns. But don't be spooked.
There's not a ghost of a chance you'll be left with haunting
memories of bad jokes here.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start our tour of the frightful sites with one called
Halloween at http://www.4halloween.com/ that can furnish all the
necessities for a traditional Halloween. You will, of course, want
to copy the recipe here for fake blood and follow some of the links
to the traditional scary stories that should be told on this
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also get hints here for making (or buying) a trick or
treat costume. And don't leave this site without reading up on the
various methods of carving a jack-o'-lantern pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've mastered that art _ and assuming you still have the
usual number of fingers left so you can operate the computer
keyboard _ let's move to Jody's Haunted Halloween Page at
http://www.netwide.net/users/lightner/halloween.html. Even if you
are unmoved by the most lifeless zombie and do not have a burning
desire to dress as a witch, you may enjoy this page.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there are recipes with a Halloween theme. You can,
for instance, prepare Tuna Spooks, or Bloody Devil Dogs, or
Gingerbread Ghosts with a little help from the recipes you find.
Or, if you lean more toward conventional fare, you'll find a good
recipe that will let you use the remains of your jack-o'-lantern to
cook up some pumpkin bread.
</P>
<P>
   But there's still more. You will find links to many other pages
with a Halloween theme as well as recommendations and designs for
trick-or-treat costumes. You'll also get some safety tips that help
make your own ghosts and goblins stand out in the dark to avoid
traffic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Halloween wouldn't feel right without a trip to a haunted house.
You'll probably find several near where you live, tours of the
awful with the admission price going to a charity.
</P>
<P>
   But if you'd like to take a tour of a virtual haunted house,
complete with sound effects and music, wander over to The Haunted
House at
http://members.aol.com/harley101/private/hween/hween1.html. You'll
also find a selection of Halloween sound files you can download.
</P>
<P>
   Next we'll stop in at a place that will give you ideas for
Halloween costumes. It's a page called Halloween and is sponsored
by McCall's Patterns. It's way too late to order the patterns from
this page at http://www.mccall.com/funstuff.html but the full color
photographs will spark some good ideas if you're planning to make
your costume this year.
</P>
<P>
   We've saved the sweetest of the sites for last. It's Hershey's
Halloween 1998 at http://www.hersheys.com/(tilde)hershey
</P>
<P>
   /halloween/. Since the site is sponsored by the famous chocolate
maker, as you would expect, there is some commercial content here.
However, as you might not expect, most of the page is used for
nifty Halloween screensavers you can download, a Halloween Handbook
that offers everything from safety tips to costume ideas, and a
really nifty feature called a Pumpkin Carving Planner.
</P>
<P>
   To use the planner, simply move the jigsaw puzzle like pieces
around. The notion is to try out various designs for a carved
pumpkin before you make the first cut. Even if you never carve a
jack-o'-lantern yourself, it's a lot of fun to use the designer.

 &HT;    Pathfinder splits off its magazine content
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pathfinder, (http://www.pathfinder.com), Time Warner's catch-all
content site that includes all its major magazine and media
properties was one of the first corporate sites to hit the Web.
Users logging on in 1995 were fascinated to find Time magazine
available on their computers. Pathfinder, along with HotWired, were
two of the Web's coolest destinations in the early days.
</P>
<P>
   But that was yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years the clunky, cluttered Pathfinder home base has
been attacked for its long download time _ users complained they
could read all of Time, half of Sports Illustrated and
Entertainment Weekly's movie reviews offline in the time it took
for Pathfinder to load. As Pathfinder lurched from one redesign to
another adding more and more content, analysts questioned the
wisdom of stacking the world's most famous magazine brands and
cable companies behind the Pathfinder Web address. Internally,
staffers struggled to develop sites that reflected each magazine's
unique style and still give Pathfinder some sense of uniformity.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, it was an uphill battle. Time Warner got tired of
fighting. In the early days, when the Web was a largely untried and
untested medium and access to it was largely by 2400 bps modems,
one-stop destinations like Pathfinder and Wired made a lot of
sense. They were fun, graphic and were perfect for the first wave
of Web surfers, fascinated more by the medium than the message.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Web evolved from an underground hobby into big
business targeting mass audiences, companies with an eye on the
bottom line began to see that promoting established brands rather
than unique hangouts was the key to online success.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, Time Warner began to break up the Pathfinder family
with the announcement that the online edition of ``People''
magazine will move off the Web and be available exclusively on
America Online. The company also said that its other popular online
brands including Entertainment Weekly, ParentTime, Money.com and
Time.com will also be available via AOL.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling here is what's the point in hiding our crown
jewels under a bushel,'' says Time Warner spokesman Graham Cannon.
``Our job in a very dynamic online environment is delivering the
kind of information people want where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   People.com's 18-month deal with AOL is an effort to find a place
where People's offline readers congregate. AOL's strong female and
family demographics make it an ideal location for the breathless
celebrity news and gossip People is famous for. Cannon says that
more than one-third of AOL's 20 million members are already People
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of content aggregators like Pathfinder are over,'' he
says. ``Pathfinder as a consumer brand is not the way I see our
users using our sites.'' Time Warner research reveals that less
than 2 percent of Time Warner's Web site traffic comes through the
Pathfinder Web address. In an age of increasing Web
commercialization, users are much more likely to type in
``time.com'' or ``EntertainmentWeekly.com.''
</P>
<P>
   The decentralization of Pathfinder, like the sale of Wired,
another early Web hangout, is a sign the Web is growing up. While
surfing the Web is still fun, the new generation of online users
want their Web sites served up quickly and their news updated
regularly from name brand products they can access by just typing
in its name. It may not be hip, but it is the future.
</P>
<P>
   Wallpapers.Com: Is there a more infernal exercise than shopping
for wallpaper (other than putting up the hated material, of course
...)? This site helps you wallpaper the background of your
computer's operating system, offering free desktop themes and
e-mail postcards for both PC and Mac, plus holiday screensavers.

 &HT;    PC World searches for problem-free PC
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Is there such a thing as a problem-free PC? The
November issue of PC World examines that question. What it found is
there are a handful of PC makers that sell dependable systems and
provide useful service. Its findings are based on a survey of more
than 6,800 PC World readers. These readers rated no PC as
outstanding. They did name several as good. Only Dell computers
earned that moniker across PC World's three categories of work,
home and notebook computers. And Acer's home PC model was the only
one to receive an unacceptable rating from readers.
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue of PC World you'll find a review of the first
electronic books, scheduled to hit stores sometime this fall. The
magazine found the idea intriguing but concluded ``reality has yet
to catch up with the potential.'' The two PC World looked at are
the SoftBook and Rocket E-Book. The biggest difference between the
two was screen quality, says PC World. It found SoftBook had a
slight off-color cast and a problem with ghosting, especially
outside. In contrast, the magazine found the Rocket E-Book's screen
was easy to read.
</P>

<P>
   Dr. Brain is a series of game titles from Knowledge Adventure
designed to make kids think. It has released a new title called
``IQ Adventure.'' Designed for kids ages 9 and up, the game opens
with players marooned in an alternative universe. They're pursued
by robots hungry to harness human brainpower. Kids save themselves
by completing 15 missions that are complex puzzles. ``IQ
Adventure'' is the first in the Dr. Brain series to let kids play
against each other online. But doing so costs an extra fee and
Internet access is required. Available only for Windows computers,
``IQ Adventure'' retails for $30.
</P>
<P>
   Another newly released educational title is Edmark's ``Let's Go
Read! 2.'' This game features IBM's speech recognition technology
that lets kids talk to the game and then have it respond. Designed
for kids ages 5-7, ``Let's Go Read'' teaches reading skills through
thinking and exploration. It focuses on phonic skills, spelling,
vocabulary and comprehension. It's available for Windows and Mac
computers and retails for $39.95.

</P>
<P>
   One of the more anticipated films of next year is the prequel to
``Star Wars.'' Now you can get a satirical sneak peek on the
Internet. The movie is called ``Here Come the Jedis!'' and will
feature both a young Obi-Wan Kenobi and a young Yoda. You'll find
this preview at Geocities at

 &HT;    Searching best search engines
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's already impressive, but what will make the
Internet a truly amazing tool is a simple way to access its
resources.
</P>
<P>
   We aren't there yet. The main access route, search engines,
speak a different language than you do and, when put to work, turn
up thousands of useless pages to search.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, we have to learn to better use what we have.
Yahoo! Internet Life, in its November issue, helps by breaking
search topics into different categories and listing what they think
is the best engine for each.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Light, http://www.northernlight.com, is listed as the
most useful search engine. The site uses search folders that
organize your search results into categories.
</P>
<P>
   It listed its own engine, Yahoo!, http://www.yahoo.com, as the
best search directory. The site was praised for categorization, a
user-friendly interface and customizable news content.
</P>
<P>
   Deja News, http://www.dejanews.com, is considered the best way
to search for newsgroup postings.
</P>
<P>
   FindMail, http://www.findmail.com, got the nod for best mailing
list search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves for Kids, http://www.ajkids.com, was the most
kid-friendly search engine. It has a feature that lets you filter
what your kids search for. Shareware Search Engine,
http://www.hotfiles.com, is a Ziff-Davis shareware directory with
downloads and reviews. For those who just want to hone their
searching capabilities, Search Engine Resource,
http://www.searchenginewatch.com, might be the place. This site
includes a tutorial that helps you refine your searches. The site
also keeps a list of search-engine links.

<P>
   Thin is good and now it's cheaper
</P>
<P>
   Sharp is releasing a new generation of Windows CE-based portable
PCs that are thinner, lighter and below $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharp Mobilon Pro has a large, full-VGA 8.2-inch color
touch-screen and keyboard. The unit weighs 2.7 pounds and is 1-inch
thin.
</P>
<P>
   The Mobilon Pro retails for a suggested $899.
</P>
<P>
   The unit was designed with mobile professionals and college
students in mind. It has an ``instant on'' Windows CE feature that
cuts boot-up time. The system allows the option of keyboard data
entry or touch-screen.
</P>
<P>
   The TV for the couch potato
</P>
<P>
   In plenty of time for the holidays, Pioneer Electronics is
coming out with some high-end in-home entertainment options.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer offers the PRO-100 projection television. It has a
51-inch screen with 1,000 lines of horizontal image resolution.
That's $4.30 a line, as estimated retail is $4,300.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you fortunate enough to be trying to choose between
a nice, newly used BMW and television monitor, Pioneer's
High-Definition Television Ready 50-inch Plasma Display might be up
your alley.
</P>
<P>
   The 3.86-inch-deep screen weighs 92 pounds and has a maximum
resolution of 1280x768 XGA and more than 980,000 pixels. Suggested
retail: $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the shopping list, closer to the average person's
limit, is the PDR-555RW Compact Disc Recorder. The $699 machine
uses standard CDR audio discs that you can record on and the new
CD-RW format, which lets you record up to 74 minutes worth. The
discs are erasable. A feature called Digital Synchro takes the
shaky-hand factor out of the process. With Digital Synchro, the
start and finish of the playback track is recognized and
automatically synchronized with the recorder.
</P>
<P>
   The Pioneer Mini Disc Recorder, the MJ-D707, also uses Digital
Synchro. The system features 20-bit A/D and D/A converters and an
automatic threshold control circuit that restores incoming digital
signals to their original form. The mini-disc recorder retails for
an estimated $399.
</P>
<P>
   First, they came up with the 10-disc changer and that seemed a
bit excessive. Then came the 25-disc and the 100-disc.
</P>
<P>
   Behold the 301-disc changer.
</P>
<P>
   The PD-F1007 Giga CD Changer is designed to load and play CDs in
the center of a roulette rack, so it is not any bigger than any
other stereo components.
</P>
<P>
   The unit retails for $349 and comes with 10 custom filing modes,
a 50-track best selection memory, an optical digital output, CD
text, CD title input. And, in case 301 CDs won't cut it, it has the
ability to attach a second unit, which lets the system hold more
than 600 CDs.

 &HT;    Things that go bump in the middle of night
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There seems to be a ghost in my computer.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose it is appropriate this problem arises as we approach
All Hallow's Eve. Perhaps it will go away when the last
trick-or-treater goes toddling down the street, gorging on stale
candy. But I doubt it.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly when this problem arose is unclear, because I tend to
walk around in a bit of a daze. Certainly I would notice if I came
into the computer room and my computer was gone, but the difference
between it being on and being off is relatively slight.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking back on it, I realize the problem has been with me for
many weeks. I can recall coming home in the afternoon to find it
on, but simply put it down to my wife using it for some reason or
other, or perhaps my daughter, a graduate student, who often comes
to our house to study. I never bothered to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, I thought, I simply forgot to turn it off before going to
bed, although that is fairly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   It came to a head about two weeks ago, after my son came home
for his annual fall visit. During this time, he more or less camps
on my wife's machine, starved for computer gaming and Web prowling.
</P>
<P>
   One morning while I was on vacation he said, ``Dad, your
computer turned itself on last night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean, turned itself on?'' I demanded, rather
stupidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came on. I was sitting at Mom's computer and all of a
sudden, yours came on. Right at midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, well. I asked him to keep an eye on it, as I am rarely up
at such an evil hour.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, it comes on every night at midnight, or a few
minutes after, he reported a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be software, I told myself. Some stupid program I
loaded for review, and perhaps even scraped off, has decided it is
supposed to switch the machine on at midnight. Some programs will
do that, I believe, to perform tasks such as backups or
defragmentation. However, I spent a couple of hours looking for a
likely culprit, and found none.
</P>
<P>
   I went into the system CMOS or setup program, where such an
event might be scheduled, but found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   I called Gateway tech support. After we finished exchanging
names, serial numbers and the results of our most recent
urinalyses, the expert inquired as to my problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``My computer turns itself on at midnight every night,'' I told
him.
</P>
<P>
   There was a long silence, during which I thought I detected a
muffled giggle. We looked at the setup program again. He excused
himself and was gone quite a while, either to consult a supervisor
or spread the humor around.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his return, he said the only answer he could come up with
was the possibility of some kind of regular power surge, strong
enough to turn on the machine but not strong enough to do any
damage. He suggested a surge suppressor.
</P>
<P>
   I have never installed a surge suppressor of any magnitude
because my old house does not have three-wire electrical outlets or
wiring. However, without much hope, I trudged out and bought a
fairly fancy surge suppressor.
</P>
<P>
   The machine came on at midnight despite the suppressor.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, before going to bed, I unplugged it. That worked. It
didn't come on. So the demon can be defeated. The question is, who
do I call _ Ghostbusters or Peter Norton?

 &HT;    It's time for that once-a-year physical
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   October is National Car Care Month. The shorter days, colder
weather, wet streets and new state emissions test for older
vehicles all come this month.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, we began to get your vehicle ready for the upcoming
season by checking the systems inside the car. This week, it's time
to look on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Take your checklist _ the one with the ``good,'' ``bad'' and
``get repaired'' column and a space for a check mark or comment.
Assign everyone a task, and let's go.
</P>
<P>
   It is best to check power mirrors, power windows, power seat and
power door lock operation while the engine is still running so it
won't draw the extra electricity from the battery. Regular mirrors,
locks, windows and seats can be checked with the engine off. Make
note of any weird noises, binding or sticking. Don't forget to
check all of the seat belts (a good job for little kids).
</P>
<P>
   Time for tires. Write L/F (for left front), R/F, L/R, R/R and
Spare on your list. Check the spare first. Make sure it is inflated
to the pressure stamped on the side of the tire.
</P>
<P>
   Check your jack, making sure all of the parts are with it and
that it works correctly. If it is at all rusted or binds, lubricate
it with some spray oil.
</P>
<P>
   Now, take a look at each ``on the ground'' tire. If the tire is
wearing evenly, all of the little lines and crevices across the
tread should look about the same.
</P>
<P>
   If there is more wear on both outer edges of each tire or if the
edges are good but the middle of the tread is worn, you need to
adjust the tire pressure. If the tire is only wearing on one side
or in spots, put a check mark in the ``get repaired'' column.
</P>
<P>
   After you inspect each tire, compare them with each other. Do
all of the tread designs (lines and crevices) have the same general
pattern? Look at the sides of the tires. Are they all made by the
same company? The two front tires should match each other in tread
design and size, as should the two rears. The front and the rears
don't have to match as long as you keep them together when you
rotate them.
</P>
<P>
   The only time I've seen a problem with different fronts and
rears is on four-wheel-drive vehicles. Mixed-up tire sizes and
tread designs can cause steering, handling and braking problems
that get worse in bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   As a tire wears, the diameter of the tire gets smaller, which is
why tires should always be replaced in pairs and mounted on either
the front or rear at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, the best brakes in the world won't stop a set of
bad tires.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to brakes. Take advantage of this mild autumn
weather and go for a ride with the windows down. Listen for any
noises coming from the wheels both when the vehicle is rolling and
when you apply the brakes. Do you feel any vibration in the brake
pedal or the steering wheel when you step on the pedal? Does the
vehicle pull right or left when you brake? Does the emergency
(parking) brake keep the vehicle from rolling when you use it?
</P>
<P>
   How does your checklist look? Even if everything looks pretty
good, I suggest making an appointment with your car doctor and
getting the other incidentals such as the battery, fluids, belts
and hoses checked.
</P>
<P>
   A once-a-year physical for your vehicle sets a good example to
the future drivers in your family.
</P>
<P>
   The Car Care Council says 5.2 percent of accidents are caused by
vehicle neglect. This is not a figure I want to be a part of.
</P>

industry, is an automotive instructor and an ASE master automobile

 &HT;    Generations at war over economic pie
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week, when astronaut John Glenn straps himself into the
shuttle Discovery, younger Americans will marvel at the
achievements of this 77-year-old hero.
</P>
<P>
   He's been a combat pilot, space pioneer, political leader and
family man. He embodies the best about his gritty generation, the
one that triumphed in World War II and then built the world's
greatest economy.
</P>
<P>
   But don't let the glowing descriptions you'll hear from young TV
reporters lead you to believe that goodwill toward older Americans
is universal. Despite the family ties that bind us, the different
generations seem to be growing apart as jealousy and economic
conflict drive wedges between the various age groups.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of Glenn's generation believe they are losing
ground financially now. At the same time, their children are
getting sick of paying high taxes to support Social Security. And
Generation Xers are afraid the baby boomers ahead of them soon will
create such a huge voting bloc of retirees that Congress will be
pushed to further boost taxes to support the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Each generation has some legitimate gripes and fears. Today's
over-65 Americans are frustrated because they are seeing their
income decline at a time when younger people are flourishing. While
jobs are plentiful and mortgages cheap for workers in the prime of
life, retirees are getting pinched by a meager 1.3 percent
cost-of-living increase in Social Security payments and a
continuing decline in the interest rates paid on savings.
</P>
<P>
   With their incomes stagnant or shrinking, many older Americans
are getting angry with their children. They resent seeing younger
generations buying bigger homes and cars. ``I've never known a more
self-indulgent, self-absorbed, self-centered generation as the baby
boomers,'' one reader said in a recent letter to me.
</P>
<P>
   A jealous 69-year-old parent wrote: ``My first home had 1,200
square feet. My daughter's home today is over 3,000, as are most of
the homes being built in north Fulton, where I still have a tiny,
one-story ranch home with wood siding.''
</P>
<P>
   But while senior citizens are complaining about ``selfish''
children, boomers are getting fed up with the kvetching of their
parents, who are getting far more out of Social Security than they
put into it. In the 1950s, the combined payroll tax for Social
Security, paid by both workers and their employers, was just 6
percent. Today, the combined tax is 12.4 percent. The World War II
generation had nowhere near the tax burden that today's workers
carry to fund benefits for aging veterans, Social Security,
Medicare and other programs for the elderly. Largely because of
that government aid, the elderly are the wealthiest demographic
group in America.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps no generation has more to fear from their elders
than Generation X, the people born from the mid-1960s to the late
1970s. Those young workers are vastly outnumbered by the boomers
who were born between 1946 and 1964.
</P>
<P>
   GenXers may find themselves suffocated by much higher taxes to
care for long-living boomers. Economists estimate that to maintain
today's level of Social Security benefits, workers in 2020 will
have to shoulder a 20 percent payroll tax.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Congress is supposed to take up Social Security reform.
The arguments could get very ugly as each generation tries to cut a
better deal for itself. For decades, the most bitter battles in
American social and political life were over race. In coming years,
the most hostile debates may be over what one generation owes
another.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions around the table at Thanksgiving may get a lot
livelier in the next century.

   CEMETERY-NEIGHBORHOODS (San Francisco) _ Some people wouldn't be
caught dead living close to a cemetery. Others, however, find a
blessing in the quiet and open space. But whether a cemetery is a
desirable residential address _ and whether it has a negative
impact on property values _ depends on geography, culture and
religious beliefs. By CORRIE M. ANDERS.
</P>
<P>
   NEXT-POPE (Albany, N.Y.) _ The successor to Pope John Paul II is
likely to be multilingual, at ease on television and black, experts

   TRAVEL-VANCOUVER (Vancouver, British Columbia) _ Stretching for
several blocks along the harbor from Canada Place to Maple Tree

and is notable for its late-Victorian architecture and an
intriguing variety of restaurants and shops. Its most riveting
attraction is a timepiece unlike any other in the world. By HARRY
SHATTUCK.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-SAN-ANTONIO (San Antonio) _ ``Taxi, please!'' Those are

your request may elicit follow-up questions: ``Do you want to
travel by land or water? By car, boat, trolley or bicycle?'' By
HARRY SHATTUCK.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-COLUMN (Undated) _ I get hundreds of correspondences each

shoot faux foam every time a Giant hits a home run. And what do the
Giants get for their trouble? Miscellaneous ``foes.'' By RAY RATTO.
</P>
<P>

THE PERFECT FALL GETAWAY, ON WHEELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STEINSTRA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Francisco Bay area's newest bike trail
has turned out to be one of the best anywhere, well worth the drive
to try it out.
</P>
<P>
   It is called Arroyo Del Valle Trail and the highlights are a
five-mile ride along lake frontage, great picnic sites, a panoramic
view from a ridge, a snack bar along the route and even a chance
for a swim. Add it up and put that in your cash register: This is a
rare opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   This new trail is located in southern Alameda County south of
Livermore, with Del Valle Reservoir the centerpiece of the ride. A
new trailhead opened at the end of September, and already the word
is getting out about the attractions.
</P>
<P>
   You start the trip by parking at the new staging area, located
at the end of Arroyo Road. There is a $2 parking fee, no change
available. Be sure to fill your water bottle at the drinking
fountain before heading off.
</P>
<P>
   The trail is more of an old ranch road, unpaved dirt/gravel,
ideal for mountain bikes. It starts by heading to a creek, actually
the outlet stream for Del Valle Reservoir, about two or three feet
deep, where you cross a bridge. Right off, the ride is pleasant.
Heading south, there are lots of oaks in the area; the air has a
nice scent to it, and the riding temperature seems perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the catch. After crossing the bridge, you start
climbing, and hey, there is one 100-yard stretch that is steep
enough that it can feel like running into a cement wall. In all,
the climb is about a mile, and many choose to walk up at least the
steepest section of the grade.
</P>
<P>
   But you will be well rewarded. You crest the ridge, and to the
south you get a beautiful view of Del Valle Reservoir (the dam is
to your right, but it is just out of view). You see this large
expanse of reservoir, looking across Heron Bay and down the length
of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Looking south, you can also see the Hamilton Range in the
distance, and in foreground, the foothill country of the Ohlone
Regional Wilderness. If you turn around and look north, you can see
all the way to Mount Diablo, the Tri-Valley area and up the ridge
to Morgan Territory, Los Trampas Wilderness, along with Brushy Peak
near Livermore.
</P>
<P>
   But something else will catch your eye. At the base of hill, you
will see flickering flashes of silver in a vineyard, owned by the
Wente winery. That is because the winery workers have placed metal
strips on the grapevines to scare off birds.
</P>
<P>
   All this, including political history, and you have only
traveled a mile.
</P>
<P>
   From here the trail is a downhill glide, steep in some
stretches, to the lakeshore. The trail generally follows the
lakeshore for about five miles to the boat ramp, a breeze all the
way, at the northeast side of Del Valle Reservoir. In a few spots,
the trail does cut inland, but these are short bypasses, required
because of the terrain, and then is routed again back above the
lake. Most of the route is adjacent to the shore, and in several
spots, the trail is quite close to water. That's even though the
lake is undergoing its annual 15-foot drawdown to make space for
winter rains.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, there are two campgrounds with restrooms and
picnic tables, one with a drinking fountain, so you can have a
picnic along the way with facilities nearby. At the boat ramp,
there also is a restroom and a snack bar. Drinking fountains are
available at the trailhead and near the boat ramp.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no sandy beaches, you can swim (at your own
risk) at the lake. Here are the rules: South of the boat ramp,
swimming is permitted only at designated areas; north of the boat
ramp, swimming is permitted anywhere, away from fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   What will you see? Fishing is quite popular at Del Valle, and
the fall season is under way, with trout plants having been made
the past three weeks. The fishing has been just OK lately, and will
get better as the water cools further and the trout stocks stack
up. Del Valle also is home for resident bald eagles and they often
emerge when you least expect it.
</P>
<P>
   The return trip requires a long but moderate climb (not as steep
as the first mile coming in). Once you hit the ridge, a note of
caution: The last mile down to the bridge and nearby parking lot is
a steep downgrade, too steep for the brakes on many bikes. Some
riders get going so fast that they cannot stop _ even when locking
their wheels, the tires just keep skidding as they head downhill,
on the edge of any resemblance of control.
</P>
<P>
   Weather has been beautiful lately, ideal for bike riding. And
this 13-mile round trip seems a perfect fall getaway.
</P>
<P>
   How could it get any better? Get this: The plan is to eventually
link this trail all the way to Shadow Cliffs Recreation Area near
Pleasanton, allowing bike riders a great day-long trip.
</P>

POPE'S SUCCESSOR PROBABLY WON'T BE AMERICAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHRIS STURGIS  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The successor to Pope John Paul II is likely to
be multilingual, at ease on television and black, experts say. But
he's not likely to hail from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That's the estimation of the Rev. Thomas J. Reese, a scholar who
edits the Jesuit magazine America and is author of ``Inside the
Vatican.''
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, the former archbishop of Krakow, Poland,
continues to head the Catholic church after 20 years, but as time
passes, speculation turns to the inevitable transition. John Paul
is the first non-Italian pope in 400 years, leaving open the
possibility for future surprises. But a U.S. pope would be more
than surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the centuries, the churches have not usually elected
someone from a superpower...I think there is a reticence about
giving one country the maximum political power and the maximum
spiritual power,'' Reese said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Marlett, assistant professor of religion at the College
of Saint Rose in Albany, said an American pope ``might make too
strong of a statement about the direction of the American church.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlett said an American pope might not critique capitalism the
way John Paul has. It is unlikely that the Church would choose a
pope who would dismantle that economic theology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Continuing that success on all fronts is very important to the
College of Cardinals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reese said talk about the next pope is widespread now since John
Paul appears frail.
</P>
<P>
   But the men who actually cast the votes, the 120 members of the
College of Cardinals, risk offending the still-living pope by
discussing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an election process that is very open or public.
This tends to occur behind closed doors over dinner among cardinals
who trust each other very much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reese said the pope who follows John Paul will need to speak
English, French, Italian and Spanish to be pastor of the whole
world and Bishop of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is a leading candidate at this point,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The next pope will have to be comfortable with the media,
because that's become an important part of being pope or world
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be someone who won't make a fool of himself on
television,'' Reese said. He said the next pope may come from the
Third World. One name that surfaces is Cardinal Francis Arinze of
Nigeria, who is now working in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a very winning personality,'' Reese said. ``He is very
charismatic; he has a sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Arinze, if selected, would be the first black pope.
</P>
<P>
   Marlett also listed some of the men widely considered possible
successors to John Paul: Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, the
archbishop of Milan, and Cardinal Bernard Gantin of the Vatican
Congregation, a French-speaking African.

WHY THE NETWORKS BREED MEDIOCRITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Television has let us down. Again.
</P>
<P>
   The networks just gave us 36 new fall presents, and like a kid
at Christmas, we feverishly unwrapped them and found _ nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of one of the worst fall seasons ever, you are not
alone in asking what went wrong. Must we be resigned to
cookie-cutter programming, stripped of rough edges and pounded into
blandness by a team of writers and a bigger team of producers?
What's the problem in Hollywood? Why is the television industry in
perpetual distress?
</P>
<P>
   Here's one reason: Mediocrity is rewarded. Oh, sure, they'll put
a fancy spin on it, but the industry is run on pay-back. People get
deals based on ``potential.'' The same problem that has plagued the
NBA in paying unproven rookies millions of dollars a year permeates
television. Say you're a writer on ``The Simpsons'' or ``Late Night
with Conan O'Brien'' or even ``Friends.'' If the show does well _
and they all did _ production companies and networks think you're
the key to their futures.
</P>
<P>
   So unproven writers _ who haven't necessarily been with a show
through several seasons of continuous quality _ are yanked off and
given their own deals. Then they produce pilots that are often not
picked up by a network or, worse, they produce shows that are
shoehorned into the schedule just because the networks have a two-
or three-series deal with said writers that they need to burn off.
</P>
<P>
   When a production team gets successful _ say Kevin Bright, Marta
Kauffman and David Crane, who gave us ``Friends,'' among others _
networks give them sweetheart deals for programs sight and script
unseen. A simple equation (say, ``ER'' meets ``Star Trek'') is
sold. This is what happened with ``Veronica's Closet,'' which has
limped along half-funny on a good week since its inception.
</P>
<P>
   The networks aren't always to blame. David Angell, Peter Casey
and David Lee are formidable producers with Emmys to prove it. They
are responsible for ``Frasier'' and ``Cheers.'' So who knew, when
NBC gave them a prime slot for ``Encore! Encore!'' (Nathan Lane as
a wacky opera singer retiring to the family vineyard in Napa,
Calif.), that the trio would turn out one of the worst sitcoms of
the year?
</P>
<P>
   It's plain that in television, mediocrity _ average ratings,
jokes that work half the time, a shopworn premise _ is viewed as
success. Lowered expectations are met and rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   For example _ and not to pick on NBC and Bright/Kauffman/Crane _
why is ``Jesse,'' the Christina Applegate sitcom, on Thursday
nights between ``Friends'' and ``Frasier''? Because it's a product
of that red-hot trio (by TV industry standards), and they got a
nice deal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the show is flat-out bad.
</P>
<P>
   NBC also gave a big-ticket contract to John Wells, executive
producer of ``ER,'' the No. 1 show on television. Sight unseen. The
first show he delivered to NBC is ``Trinity,'' an unholy mess of
cliches and false emotions. Would NBC have put that show on its
schedule if it didn't have Wells attached? Doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   Trading on past success is nothing new in Hollywood. This year
Chris Keyser and Amy Lippman, who gave Fox ``Party of Five'' and
nurtured it into a hit, developed another show for the network
called ``Significant Others,'' which tanked immediately. That
didn't stop CBS from signing them to a deal. On and on it goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murphy Brown'' creator Diane English got the reins of a new
Fox show for fall called ``Living In Captivity,'' then promptly
filled it with tired suburban jokes until it was yanked last week.
</P>
<P>
   At least English has created some quality television. Many
producers churn out fluff that gets ratings and then mimic the
formula all the way to Beverly Hills. This season Carlton Cuse,
whose ``Nash Bridges'' is slight but watchable, delivered ``Martial
Law'' to CBS, which was nothing more than a Kung-Fu cartoon, if
funny for that very reason.
</P>
<P>
   What does the future hold for network television? A lot more of
the same _ and maybe worse. The two fledgling networks _ UPN and
The WB _ are going after name talent with big bucks. UPN just
signed a deal with Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana (``Homicide: Life
on the Street,'' ``Oz''). If producers of that level move away from
the Big Four, expect even more inexperienced and unproven young
writers to get their own shows and this cycle of mediocrity to
repeat itself for years to come.

NEW GERMAN GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES PROVOKE HOSTILITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Gerhard Schroeder's new government, a coalition of his
Social Democrats and the Green Party's left-leaning ecologists,
comes officially to power Tuesday in what is being portrayed as the
biggest change in German politics in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition's program received a warm endorsement at a
European Union summit last weekend _ in marked contrast to a much
cooler reception at home.
</P>
<P>
   The government's plans call for a shift in Germany's intricate
tax structure that will take a greater slice of corporate earnings
and leave more take-home income in the hands of consumers. As such,
it is a radical departure from the policies of former conservative
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who lost office in last month's
parliamentary elections after 16 years in power.
</P>
<P>
   The Kohl government regularly hiked individual taxes, leaving
disposable income virtually flat. But companies largely escaped
higher taxes on the theory that this policy helped industry and
commerce create more jobs _ an argument that lost support when
German unemployment reached a postwar high of more than 12 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
   However, the new plans already have been sharply assailed by
business critics as amounting to a thinly veiled scheme for wealth
redistribution, bolstered by a revival of Keynesian theories of
government intervention in the economy that have been discredited
in most other advanced industrial nations.
</P>
<P>
   The main target of criticism is the new finance minister, Oskar
Lafontaine, considered by many observers as the real power behind
Schroeder. Lafontaine, a onetime Social Democratic Party leader, is
said to believe he, not Schroeder, should be chancellor. In any
case, he speaks for his party's left wing, and his power base is
strong.
</P>
<P>
   Lafontaine has a reputation of being antibusiness, and he is
seen by the government's critics as the one behind the new tax
plans. He has been strengthened by the inclusion in the government
of the Green Party, which has often been at odds with big business.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Germany's biggest and most prestigious economic think
tanks, informally known as the ``big six,'' also criticized the new
government's program _ but on grounds that it will have only a
minimal effect on unemployment and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, who will become Germany's seventh postwar chancellor,
has declared that he is seeking an ``alliance for jobs'' with
industry and labor unions. But the country's businss establishment
has already rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within two years, the new government will discover that
without basic structural reforms and a significant tax cut for
family-owned businesses, unemployment will not fall,'' declared a
spokesman for the German Industry Association, a leading
big-business group.

THESE YANKEES AREN'T QUITE THE BEST EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN SHEA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Yankees are the best team of all time, aren't they
supposed to have at least one guy among the league's top five in
home runs or RBIs or steals or ERA or saves? Aren't they supposed
to have at least one potential Hall of Famer? Aren't they supposed
to win World Series games by larger margins than 5-4 and 3-0?
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to say the Yankees aren't even the best team in the
last 30 years. As good as their final record was _ 75 games over
.500 isn't shabby _ it'll always be tainted because it came in an
expansion season, with bad pitching in Tampa Bay and mediocre
pitching everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Few folks know more about great teams of the last 30 years than
Merv Rettenmund, who played on the Orioles of the early '70s and
Reds of the mid-'70s. He also coached for the A's of the late
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd take the '89 A's,'' said Rettenmund, now the Padres'
batting coach. ``That team was the complete package. They had Jose
Canseco, my God what a player. Rickey (Henderson) was running all
over the place. Great starting pitching with Stew (Dave Stewar) and
(Bob) Welch. Eck (Dennis Eckersley) in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they could have played the National League All-Stars
in the World Series and beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   How do the Yankees compare to the pitching-rich Baltimore
Orioles and the star-studded Big Red Machine? ``They don't have as
good an offense as the Reds. But their pitching is better. The
Orioles had the pitching and defense, but they didn't have the same
team speed as the Yankees and couldn't score as many runs.''
</P>
<P>
   To be classified as the best in history, Rettenmund added, the
Yankees must ``win the next three or four World Series. You make
that claim and call them the best ever. But not now.''
</P>
<P>
   Then maybe not ever, because the Yankees' roster could be in for
a major change. It could start with Bernie Williams, who, like the
Padres' Kevin Brown will seek a contract paying $10 million to $12
million annually. That may be too much even for the Yankees, who
realize Williams' power numbers aren't the best and won't forget he
went 1-for-16 in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the Yankees have several other contractual concerns and
are looking longterm with arbitration-eligible Derek Jeter, Mariano
Rivera and Andy Pettitte. Scott Brosius' free-agent price tag
skyrocketed (from $2.5 million in '98 to $5 million in '99?) after
he won the World Series MVP award, and 20-game winner David Cone is
expected to decline a $5.5 million option and seek a richer pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Bernie's situation is first and foremost for us,''
general manager Brian Cashman said. ``It's going to be difficult to
keep everything status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Same with the Padres, who probably will lack resources to
re-sign Brown, and it certainly won't happen if their Nov. 3
stadium proposal is voted down. The Cardinals are talking seriously
about signing Brown to a four-year deal for about $53 million.
</P>
<P>
   Padre insiders say it's less than 50-50 that Brown will return,
even though they would make an offer of $10 million per season over
three to five years. Brown is committed to playing closer to his
Georgia home.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is we're going to make a strong effort to sign
Kevin Brown,'' Padres owner John Moores said. ``We're just going to
have to understand where the market is, just as Kevin is going to
have to understand where the market is. The question is (whether)
to spend $10 million on a pitcher or $5 million (each) on two
players.''

   GERMANY _ When Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder is sworn in
Oct. 27, Germany officially begins a new era. The new government, a
coalition in which key posts will be held by former leaders of the
environmental and pacifist movements of the 1970s, is younger, more
female and in many ways more diverse than the administration of
Helmut Kohl, who held power for 16 years. But Schroeder and his
government face many challenges, not least in the new Europe Kohl
played a large role in creating. German Ambassador to the U.S.
Juergen Chrobog describes the challenges and discusses what the
changes in Germany mean for the United States. (Graham, Atlanta

   SODOMY _ NEW ORLEANS _ With a witness list as colorful as it is

The law makes oral or anal sex a criminal act, even between
consenting adults. Louisiana is one of 13 states that makes such
sex a crime between couples. Six other states outlaw the conduct
between same-sex partners only. Enforcement of the law was barred
in every Louisiana parish except Jefferson Parish since the
Louisiana Electorate of Gays and Lesbians Inc. received an
injunction in Orleans Parish in 1994. But State District Judge
Robert Murphy extended the ban to Jefferson Parish in a ruling
issued last Friday. (Rochell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 &HT;    
 By AMY WALDMAN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The runners of the New York Marathon may be masochistic, but
they are not stupid: They run in the fall. After all, if you are
going to see the five boroughs as a blur while gasping for breath,
you might as well do it when the colors are crisp and the air
brisk.
 &HT;    Attitudes are brisk, too: When the heat leaves, the locals
return, their hunger to master the universe recharged.
 &HT;    The roaring '90s continue in New York, and in an appropriately
fin de siecle paradox, the city is both prospering and
deteriorating.
 &HT;    The proof is in the number of buildings going up _ witness the
construction boom around Times Square _ and the number falling
down, as suggested by a recent report calling for $90 billion in
infrastucture fixes in the city (and by the bricks peeling off old
buildings and onto the streets below).
 &HT;    The one adjective that does not apply to New York is static.
Neighborhoods molt and acquire new identities so fast that you can
blink and miss the metamorphoses.
 &HT;    The downtown commercial art scene is moving to Chelsea, while
young designers are forsaking SoHo for NoLIta, north of Little
Italy. Brooklyn and Queens, too, have taken on new cachet, as
places both to live and to visit.
 &HT;    After summer's lazy dress rehearsal, fall is when the show
begins, literally, with a new cultural season. There is a
head-spinning selection of art, theater, music and dance.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Two of the 20th century's greatest Abstract Expressionists are
the subjects of big retrospectives this fall.
 &HT;    Mark Rothko's early Surrealist works and color-saturated
canvases are on view in ``Mark Rothko: A Retrospective,'' at the
Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Ave., at 75th Street,
through Nov. 29.
 &HT;    This year the Whitney also opened 11 intimate galleries focusing
on art from 1900 to 1950. Open Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and
Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Thursday from 1 to 8 p.m.
Admission is $9; (212) 570-3676.
 &HT;    ``Jackson Pollock: A Retrospective,'' from Nov. 1 to Feb. 2 at
the Museum of Modern Art, at 11 West 53d St., is the first
retrospective of Pollock's work since 1967, and covers his entire
career. Open daily except Wednesday 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., and to
8:30 p.m. on Friday. Admission: $9.50; (212) 708-9400.
 &HT;    So far, this Broadway season offers no new spectacle like the
``Lion King'' or must-have ticket like ``Cabaret.''
 &HT;    At Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater, Harold Prince is
directing ``Parade,'' a new musical based on the true story of Leo
Frank, a Jewish factory worker accused of murdering a 13-year-old
girl in Georgia in 1913. Previews begin Nov. 12. Tickets: $50 to
$75; (212) 239-6200.
 &HT;    Dance assumes center stage in several productions.
``Footloose,'' the 1984 movie about the standoff between a
small-town preacher and a high-stepping outsider, is now a Broadway
musical, co-written and directed by Walter Bobbie, who won a Tony
for his direction of ``Chicago.'' It's at the Richard Rodgers, 226
West 46th St. Tickets: $20 to $75; (212) 307-4100.
 &HT;    And ``Swan Lake'' came to Broadway this month in a version by
Matthew Bourne, the British choreographer and director, at the Neil
Simon Theater at 250 West 52d Street. The production won raves in
London and Los Angeles. The twist: all the dancers are men _
wearing feathery pantaloons, not tutus. Tickets: $15 to $75; (212)
307-4100.
 &HT;    The most controversial ticket of the season promises to be
``Corpus Christi'' by Terrence McNally, starring an as yet unknown
actor, Anson Mount.
 &HT;    The play centers on a gay Jesus-like figure and was briefly
called off earlier this year after protests by the Catholic League
and anonymous bomb threats. A Manhattan Theater Club production, it
is at City Center, 131 West 55th St. Tickets are $50; (212)
581-1212.
 &HT;    In early December, the Brooklyn Philharmonic performs a
semistaged version of ``Powder Her Face,'' a new opera by the
English composer Thomas Ades about the life of Margaret, Duchess of
Argyll, whose sensational divorce rocked England in the 1960s. At
the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theater, Dec. 8, 10, and
12. Tickets: $20 to $45; (212) 307-4100.
 &HT;    On Nov. 12 and 14, at Alice Tully Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center
presents ``Blues Up and Down: A Battle in the Bucket,'' with jazz
elder statesmen like Teddy Edwards and Al Grey trying to outdo
younger talents like Cyrus Chestnut and Nicholas Payton. Tickets:
$37.50; (212) 721-6500.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The Lower East Side Tenement Museum offers one-hour historical
walking tours of a neighborhood that is gentrifying faster than a
New York apartment rents.
 &HT;    The tours leave from 90 Orchard St. and run weekends at 1:30 and
2: 30 p.m. through December; tickets $8. The museum also offers
frequent tours of its Tenement House, an 1863 building with
recreated apartments as they would have been during the 1870s,
1916, and the 1930s; (212) 431-0233.
 &HT;    There is no better time than fall to explore Fort Tryon Park,
which is also home to the rich medieval offerings of the Cloisters,
the upper Manhattan branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 &HT;    The only thing missing is the Unicorn tapestries, which have
been removed until January while the museum undergoes renovations.
Open Tuesday to Sunday, 9:30 a.m. until 5:15 p.m. through October,
to 4:45 p.m. after November. Admission: $8; (212) 923-3700.
 &HT;    The Wollman Rink in Central Park opened for ice skating on Oct.
15. With buildings rising like castle spires behind the trees,
there are few more magical settings for exercise _ north of the
entrance at Central Park South and Avenue of the Americas.
Admission: $4; (212) 396-9203.
 &HT;    In Chelsea, the West 20s between 10th Avenue and the Hudson
River have filled with dozens of galleries. You can start an
informal walking tour at the Dia Center for the Arts, at 548 West
22d St., now showing works by Robert Irwin and Joseph Beuys, and
then meander through the surrounding blocks.
 &HT;    The shops of NoLIta, the surreally quiet, oddly self-contained
blocks of Elizabeth, Mulberry and Mott between Spring and Houston,
seem made as much for looking as for buying. Stores include a glass
blower (Michael Anchin, at 250 Elizabeth St.), a milliner (Kelly
Christy, at 235 Elizabeth St.), and nearly two dozen eclectic
clothing stores.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Many hotels offer weekend specials or even discounted regular
rates, but occupancy rates in New York are so high _ 83 percent
this year _ that reservations are important. These hotels are
either new or recently renovated:
 &HT;    One look at the green carpet and the portrait of Mary McAlees,
the president of Ireland, on the wall, and you'll get the theme at
the Fitzpatrick Grand Central Hotel, which opened in August at 141
East 44th Street; (212) 351-6800, fax (212) 818-1747. The rooms are
not green, but tastefully decorated with canopied beds. Doubles
start at $325.
 &HT;    The Roger Williams, 131 Madison Ave., at 31st Street, was built
around 1928 but was thoroughly renovated last fall. Its sleek,
modern lobby includes a 20-foot atrium, and its 209 minimalist
rooms are done in white and beige with blond wood, and equipped
with CD players and VCRs. Doubles from $245; (212) 448-7000; fax:
(212) 448-7007.
 &HT;    The Algonquin, 59 West 44th St., (212) 840-6800; fax (212)
944-1419, finished a major renovation this year with an accent on
nostalgia. The lobby has been darkened to evoke an air of
antiquity, and the halls have been wallpapered with New Yorker
cartoons, a self-conscious reminder of the hotel's history as a
literary gathering place.
 &HT;    The Rose Room has been absorbed into the lobby, but the Round
Table remains. Guest rooms retain an old New York feel, with pewter
blue and cream decor, antiques, and headboards carved of dark wood.
Doubles: $329.
 &HT;    Budget: The Bentley Hotel, 500 East 62d St., (212) 644-6000, fax
(212) 207-4800, near the Roosevelt Island tram, has made the
transformation from office building to hotel with admirable grace.
It has a small reading library in the lobby, and its 229 rooms are
modern, spacious and simple. The higher floors have sweeping views
of the city. Doubles start at $195.
 &HT;    The New York Marriott Brooklyn, 333 Adams St., (718) 246-7000,
fax (718) 222-6535, is the borough's first new hotel in nearly 70
years, and a convenient base for exploring either Brooklyn or
Manhattan. It is a short walk from six subway lines and the
Brooklyn Bridge. The 374 rooms are comfortably furnished, with
unusually high ceilings, and there is a health club and pool.
Doubles start at $229.
 &HT;    Luxury: Even a grand dame needs an occasional make-over. The
Waldorf-Astoria and Waldorf Towers, 301 Park Ave. at 50th Street,
has just completed a renovation that, among other things, uncovered
original mosaics and murals in the Park Avenue lobby, transformed
Oscar's from a coffee shop into a softly lighted Art Deco bistro,
and created a new lounge in the Towers. Doubles start at $295 main,
$425 Towers; (212) 355-3000, fax (212)872-7272.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Park View at the Boathouse: the Loeb Boathouse in Central Park
has a new restaurant featuring Asian-influenced American cuisine to
complement its bucolic lakeside setting. It will stay open all
year, offering outdoor dining (with heaters) until Nov. 1, then
moving inside, where fireplaces have been installed. Dinner for two
with wine is about $150; (212) 517-2233.
 &HT;    Occupying the Coach House's former home, at 110 Waverly Place in
Greenwich Village, is Babbo, a modern Italian restaurant both
elegant and casual that combines unusual ingredients in unorthodox
ways; specialties include such pastas as mint love letters with
spicy lamb sausage, spicy ``Sicilian lifeguard'' two-minute
calamari, and saffron pannacotta with poached peaches and lemon
balm. Dinner for two, with wine, is about $130; (212) 777-0303.
 &HT;    If you want to sample the ``new'' Lower East Side, try Torch, a
supper club and lounge, at 137 Ludlow Street, which features South
American-influenced French cuisine, including a well-spiced
hamburger and popcorn-topped ceviche.
 &HT;    Along with the banquettes and sultry lighting, the attraction is
the array of torch singers who perform jazz standards nightly.
Dinner for two with wine costs about $90; (212) 228-5151.
 &HT;    After a hike over the Brooklyn Bridge (breathtaking even with
traffic rumbling below _ and, of course, free), warm up at
Grimaldi's, on 19 Old Fulton St. a cobblestone's throw from the
bridge. In the endless debate over the city's best pizza,
Grimaldi's is a front-runner; acolytes line up outside. Dinner for
two with wine is $30; (718) 858-4300.
 &HT;    At Gabriela's, 685 Amsterdam Ave., a casual, friendly Mexican
restaurant, you can get a savory roasted half-chicken _ with ample
side dishes like rice, beans and guacamole, for $6.50. It offers
traditional dishes like baby cactus salad and pozole, the filling
Mexican soup made with hominy. Dinner for two, with margaritas:
$25; (212) 961-0574.

Italy. Brooklyn and Queens, too, have taken on new cachet, as
places both to live and to visit.
 &HT;    After summer's lazy dress rehearsal, fall is when the show
begins, literally, with a new cultural season. There is a
head-spinning selection of art, theater, music and dance.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Two of the 20th century's greatest Abstract Expressionists are
the subjects of big retrospectives this fall.
 &HT;    Mark Rothko's early Surrealist works and color-saturated
canvases are on view in ``Mark Rothko: A Retrospective,'' at the
Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Ave., at 75th Street,
through Nov. 29.
 &HT;    This year the Whitney also opened 11 intimate galleries focusing
on art from 1900 to 1950. Open Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and
Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Thursday from 1 to 8 p.m.
Admission is $9; (212) 570-3676.
 &HT;    ``Jackson Pollock: A Retrospective,'' from Nov. 1 to Feb. 2 at
the Museum of Modern Art, at 11 West 53d St., is the first
retrospective of Pollock's work since 1967, and covers his entire
career. Open daily except Wednesday 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., and to
8:30 p.m. on Friday. Admission: $9.50; (212) 708-9400.
 &HT;    So far, this Broadway season offers no new spectacle like the
``Lion King'' or must-have ticket like ``Cabaret.''
 &HT;    At Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater, Harold Prince is
directing ``Parade,'' a new musical based on the true story of Leo
Frank, a Jewish factory worker accused of murdering a 13-year-old
girl in Georgia in 1913. Previews begin Nov. 12. Tickets: $50 to
$75; (212) 239-6200.
 &HT;    Dance assumes center stage in several productions.
``Footloose,'' the 1984 movie about the standoff between a
small-town preacher and a high-stepping outsider, is now a Broadway
musical, co-written and directed by Walter Bobbie, who won a Tony
for his direction of ``Chicago.'' It's at the Richard Rodgers, 226
West 46th St. Tickets: $20 to $75; (212) 307-4100.
 &HT;    And ``Swan Lake'' came to Broadway this month in a version by
Matthew Bourne, the British choreographer and director, at the Neil
Simon Theater at 250 West 52d Street. The production won raves in
London and Los Angeles. The twist: all the dancers are men _
wearing feathery pantaloons, not tutus. Tickets: $15 to $75; (212)
307-4100.
 &HT;    The most controversial ticket of the season promises to be
``Corpus Christi'' by Terrence McNally, starring an as yet unknown
actor, Anson Mount.
 &HT;    The play centers on a gay Jesus-like figure and was briefly
called off earlier this year after protests by the Catholic League
and anonymous bomb threats. A Manhattan Theater Club production, it
is at City Center, 131 West 55th St. Tickets are $50; (212)
581-1212.
 &HT;    In early December, the Brooklyn Philharmonic performs a
semistaged version of ``Powder Her Face,'' a new opera by the
English composer Thomas Ades about the life of Margaret, Duchess of
Argyll, whose sensational divorce rocked England in the 1960s. At
the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theater, Dec. 8, 10, and
12. Tickets: $20 to $45; (212) 307-4100.
 &HT;    On Nov. 12 and 14, at Alice Tully Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center
presents ``Blues Up and Down: A Battle in the Bucket,'' with jazz
elder statesmen like Teddy Edwards and Al Grey trying to outdo
younger talents like Cyrus Chestnut and Nicholas Payton. Tickets:
$37.50; (212) 721-6500.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The Lower East Side Tenement Museum offers one-hour historical
walking tours of a neighborhood that is gentrifying faster than a
New York apartment rents.
 &HT;    The tours leave from 90 Orchard St. and run weekends at 1:30 and
2: 30 p.m. through December; tickets $8. The museum also offers
frequent tours of its Tenement House, an 1863 building with
recreated apartments as they would have been during the 1870s,
1916, and the 1930s; (212) 431-0233.
 &HT;    There is no better time than fall to explore Fort Tryon Park,
which is also home to the rich medieval offerings of the Cloisters,
the upper Manhattan branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 &HT;    The only thing missing is the Unicorn tapestries, which have
been removed until January while the museum undergoes renovations.
Open Tuesday to Sunday, 9:30 a.m. until 5:15 p.m. through October,
to 4:45 p.m. after November. Admission: $8; (212) 923-3700.
 &HT;    The Wollman Rink in Central Park opened for ice skating on Oct.
15. With buildings rising like castle spires behind the trees,
there are few more magical settings for exercise _ north of the
entrance at Central Park South and Avenue of the Americas.
Admission: $4; (212) 396-9203.
 &HT;    In Chelsea, the West 20s between 10th Avenue and the Hudson
River have filled with dozens of galleries. You can start an
informal walking tour at the Dia Center for the Arts, at 548 West
22d St., now showing works by Robert Irwin and Joseph Beuys, and
then meander through the surrounding blocks.
 &HT;    The shops of NoLIta, the surreally quiet, oddly self-contained
blocks of Elizabeth, Mulberry and Mott between Spring and Houston,
seem made as much for looking as for buying. Stores include a glass
blower (Michael Anchin, at 250 Elizabeth St.), a milliner (Kelly
Christy, at 235 Elizabeth St.), and nearly two dozen eclectic
clothing stores.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Many hotels offer weekend specials or even discounted regular
rates, but occupancy rates in New York are so high _ 83 percent
this year _ that reservations are important. These hotels are
either new or recently renovated:
 &HT;    One look at the green carpet and the portrait of Mary McAlees,
the president of Ireland, on the wall, and you'll get the theme at
the Fitzpatrick Grand Central Hotel, which opened in August at 141
East 44th Street; (212) 351-6800, fax (212) 818-1747. The rooms are
not green, but tastefully decorated with canopied beds. Doubles
start at $325.
 &HT;    The Roger Williams, 131 Madison Ave., at 31st Street, was built
around 1928 but was thoroughly renovated last fall. Its sleek,
modern lobby includes a 20-foot atrium, and its 209 minimalist
rooms are done in white and beige with blond wood, and equipped
with CD players and VCRs. Doubles from $245; (212) 448-7000; fax:
(212) 448-7007.
 &HT;    The Algonquin, 59 West 44th St., (212) 840-6800; fax (212)
944-1419, finished a major renovation this year with an accent on
nostalgia. The lobby has been darkened to evoke an air of
antiquity, and the halls have been wallpapered with New Yorker
cartoons, a self-conscious reminder of the hotel's history as a
literary gathering place.
 &HT;    The Rose Room has been absorbed into the lobby, but the Round
Table remains. Guest rooms retain an old New York feel, with pewter
blue and cream decor, antiques, and headboards carved of dark wood.
Doubles: $329.
 &HT;    Budget: The Bentley Hotel, 500 East 62d St., (212) 644-6000, fax
(212) 207-4800, near the Roosevelt Island tram, has made the
transformation from office building to hotel with admirable grace.
It has a small reading library in the lobby, and its 229 rooms are
modern, spacious and simple. The higher floors have sweeping views
of the city. Doubles start at $195.
 &HT;    The New York Marriott Brooklyn, 333 Adams St., (718) 246-7000,
fax (718) 222-6535, is the borough's first new hotel in nearly 70
years, and a convenient base for exploring either Brooklyn or
Manhattan. It is a short walk from six subway lines and the
Brooklyn Bridge. The 374 rooms are comfortably furnished, with
unusually high ceilings, and there is a health club and pool.
Doubles start at $229.
 &HT;    Luxury: Even a grand dame needs an occasional make-over. The
Waldorf-Astoria and Waldorf Towers, 301 Park Ave. at 50th Street,
has just completed a renovation that, among other things, uncovered
original mosaics and murals in the Park Avenue lobby, transformed
Oscar's from a coffee shop into a softly lighted Art Deco bistro,
and created a new lounge in the Towers. Doubles start at $295 main,
$425 Towers; (212) 355-3000, fax (212)872-7272.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Park View at the Boathouse: the Loeb Boathouse in Central Park
has a new restaurant featuring Asian-influenced American cuisine to
complement its bucolic lakeside setting. It will stay open all
year, offering outdoor dining (with heaters) until Nov. 1, then
moving inside, where fireplaces have been installed. Dinner for two
with wine is about $150; (212) 517-2233.
 &HT;    Occupying the Coach House's former home, at 110 Waverly Place in
Greenwich Village, is Babbo, a modern Italian restaurant both
elegant and casual that combines unusual ingredients in unorthodox
ways; specialties include such pastas as mint love letters with
spicy lamb sausage, spicy ``Sicilian lifeguard'' two-minute
calamari, and saffron pannacotta with poached peaches and lemon
balm. Dinner for two, with wine, is about $130; (212) 777-0303.
 &HT;    If you want to sample the ``new'' Lower East Side, try Torch, a
supper club and lounge, at 137 Ludlow Street, which features South
American-influenced French cuisine, including a well-spiced
hamburger and popcorn-topped ceviche.
 &HT;    Along with the banquettes and sultry lighting, the attraction is
the array of torch singers who perform jazz standards nightly.
Dinner for two with wine costs about $90; (212) 228-5151.
 &HT;    After a hike over the Brooklyn Bridge (breathtaking even with
traffic rumbling below _ and, of course, free), warm up at
Grimaldi's, on 19 Old Fulton St. a cobblestone's throw from the
bridge. In the endless debate over the city's best pizza,
Grimaldi's is a front-runner; acolytes line up outside. Dinner for
two with wine is $30; (718) 858-4300.
 &HT;    At Gabriela's, 685 Amsterdam Ave., a casual, friendly Mexican
restaurant, you can get a savory roasted half-chicken _ with ample
side dishes like rice, beans and guacamole, for $6.50. It offers
traditional dishes like baby cactus salad and pozole, the filling
Mexican soup made with hominy. Dinner for two, with margaritas:
$25; (212) 961-0574.

</P>
<P>
   Mature travelers who aren't bargain-savvy may discover that
their vacation bills are rising as hotel occupancy rates climb and
the number of empty airplane seats decreases. This is quite a
change from a few years ago when hotels were overbuilt and planes
were flying half-full. It was then that generous senior discounts
were born as a way for travel companies to fill their seats and
their rooms at non-peak travel times.
</P>
<P>
   Today, these discounts are taking on a new look _ what they call
in the travel industry ``value-added'' benefits. These are not just
flat percentages off, but extras: a per-room rate rather than
per-person, food and beverage discounts and vouchers, packages with
touring included, event-oriented promotions like anniversary or
birthday rates or those tied to special cultural events like
concerts and art exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   There are even discounts that benefit travel companies: By
rewarding passengers with an early-booking discount, a cruise or
tour operator can get a better handle on planning for their
customers. Another helpful discount is one that is enriched to lure
the off-season traveler when the travel company needs more
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Many discounts are beginning to show up in the cruise industry.
With mega-liners being built, the cruise industry needs to fill a
growing number of berths, so cruise bargains may be the easiest to
find right now.
</P>
<P>
   Mature travelers should try to be flexible in their travel
plans, be very smart shoppers and read between the lines of
offerings. We can shop for bargains by season, location and other
factors. For example, if breakfasts are a regular part of your day,
a free breakfast can save $7 to $12 per day.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping smartly requires comparison shopping. ``Runzheimer's
Guide to Daily Travel Prices'' (check your library) can offer
benchmarks. These are the most- and least-costly U.S. cities for
travel accommodations:

   While these prices are for first-class lodging, look for ways to
beat the averages with senior discounts, choosing a business hotel
for a weekend or trying a resort hotel in midweek or off-season.

too. Runzheimer, which analyzes travel and living costs, provides

   Shopping smartly requires comparison shopping. ``Runzheimer's
Guide to Daily Travel Prices'' (check your library) can offer
benchmarks. These are the most- and least-costly U.S. cities for
travel accommodations:

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Travelers who've been almost everywhere can be hard to please
when Christmas rolls around. So here are a few suggestions to put
under the Christmas tree. Rates are per-person, based on double
occupancy. (Wrapping is optional.)
 &HT;    For James Bond fans, what could be better than a stay at
Goldeneye, the former home of author Ian Fleming in Oracabessa,
Jamaica.
 &HT;    This is the tropical getaway where the late Fleming wrote most
of the Bond novels, and some of his original furniture and
photographs remain.
 &HT;    The property was made available to the public in 1998 by its
current owner, Chris Blackwell, the man behind the Island Outpost
hotel group and Island Records.
 &HT;    The tab for renting the three-bedroom house that can sleep up to
six people? Just $5,000 per day, including all meals and drinks
(Island Outpost, 1330 Ocean Drive, Miami Beach, Fla. 33139;
800-OUTPOST).
 &HT;    For the hungry traveler, use a linen napkin to gift-wrap ``Great
Restaurants: Bordeaux to the Mediterranean,'' a moveable feast
through France from Sept. 12 to 18, 1999.
 &HT;    During this seven-day, six-night trip, participants manage to
eat at 11 Michelin-starred restaurants, including Les Pris
d'Euginie and Les Jardins de L'Opira.
 &HT;    Guests stay in country inns, enjoy sightseeing excursions in the
Pyrenees and taste regional wines.
 &HT;    The price for this gastronomic indulgence is $3,995 from France
in Your Glass (814 35th Ave., Seattle, Wash. 98122; 800-578-0903;
www.inyourglass.com).
 &HT;    How about a quick trip to London? Well, there's always the
Concorde. British Airways has a luxurious package for those who are
long on cash but short on time.
 &HT;    Passengers fly from New York to London on the supersonic
Concorde, stay three nights at the five-star Claridges hotel and
return in Club World business class. They get daily full English
breakfast, service charges, VAT and a chauffeur-driven private car
from Heathrow as well.
 &HT;    The tab is $5,829 and for $900, they can upgrade to the Concorde
for the return flight. (British Airways, Holiday Desk, 75-20
Astoria Blvd., Jackson Heights, N.Y. 11370; 800-876-2200).
 &HT;    For friends who always insist upon staying at the best places, a
more affordable gift might be a subscription to ``Andrew Harper's
Hideaway Report'' (Box 50, Sun Valley, Idaho 83353; fax only,
406-862-3486;).
 &HT;    The last word in five-star hotel and resort reviews, this is the
monthly bible for those who prefer to lay their heads only on the
best pillows. The cost of keeping up with world-wide luxury is $135
for 12 issues.
 &HT;    Few countries in the Middle East are as remote as Yemen, a
county best appreciated through its archaeological treasures. So
consider a 17-day archaeological tour of the country from Nov. 13
to 29, 1999, led by Dr. Trevor Marchand of the University of London
and offered by Archaeological Tours (271 Madison Ave., Suite 904,
New York, N.Y. 10016; 212-986-3054).
 &HT;    Including Sana'a and the ancient villages of Wadi Hadhramawt,
the cost is $5,075 _ including airfare from New York.
 &HT;    Far from the Middle East, polar bears roam the west coast of
Canada's Hudson Bay. The best and the safest way to view them is on
a tour with Natural Habitat Adventures (2945 Center Green Court,
Boulder, Colo. 80301; 800-543-8917).
 &HT;    These are six- to nine-day trips that go from Winnipeg, Manitoba
to Churchill, a grain port on Hudson Bay.
 &HT;    Over a thousand bears typically stop near Churchill on their
annual fall migration, earning the town the nickname of ``Polar
Bear Capital of the World.'' By using tundra vehicles, the animals
can be viewed safely at close range.
 &HT;    The ``Polar Bear Watch'' starts at $2,195, including
accommodation, most meals and round-trip charter flights from
Winnipeg with departures in October and November, 1999.
 &HT;    Dog-lovers on anyone's list might enjoy a dog-sledding
expedition to the Brooks Range in Alaska (American Wilderness
Experience, 2820-A Wilderness Place, Boulder, Colo. 80301;
800-444-0099).
 &HT;    These lodge-based trips north of the Arctic Circle promise a
proficiency in mushing by trip's end as well as front-row seats for
the Northern Lights. Prices for a four-day lodge trip start at
$1,700 plus $225 round-trip airfare from Fairbanks.
 &HT;    Speaking of ice, all but one of the six National Hockey League
arenas have closed down or been demolished. Only Maple Leaf Gardens
in Toronto remains, but this is its last season.
 &HT;    For diehard hockey fans who want to catch a last game there with
the Toronto Maple Leafs, there's Roadtrips (177 Lombard Ave., 7th
Floor, Winnipeg, MB, Canada R3B 0W5; 800-465-1765;
www.roadtrips.com).
 &HT;    They have ``Toronto Hall of Fame Getaways'' throughout the
1998-1999 hockey season, two-night packages that include
accommodations in a first-class hotel and seats for one game at
Maple Leaf Gardens. Prices start at $229 and include a pass to the
Hockey Hall of Fame.
 &HT;    Finally, an intriguing gift for the marrying kind comes from
Carnival Cruise Lines (3655 N.W. 87th Ave., Miami, Fla. 33178;
800-933-4968). The cruise line has new on-island wedding ceremonies
on Ocho Rios, Jamaica for $595, on Key West for $595 and on Nassau,
Bahamas for $995.
 &HT;    Those prices include a civil ceremony, photography, decorated
bridal aisle, pre-recorded wedding music, wedding cake, champagne,
flowers and on-island transportation. They do not include the price
of the cruise. Or the ring.

   With Power Stroke diesel,
</P>
<P>
   F-350 a titan of towing
</P>
<P>
   What makes a Ford F-350 such a heavenly towing vehicle, and why
would anyone consider a Crew Cab over an extended or SuperCab
edition?
</P>
<P>
   For me, the biggest reason to look at the Ford F-350 Super Duty
for towing is the option of the Power Stroke diesel engine. It is
only available on the F-350. I personally experienced almost 15 mpg
on a 4x4 version. Ever since, I have been curious as to how a 4x2
would fair.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, I chased down a guy driving an F-350 4x2 in a
parking lot. After I got him to quit grinning about his work truck,
he volunteered that pulling a 10,000-pound load intown, he got 14
mpg. We both agreed that out on the highway you could reasonably
expect to pick up at least two to three miles per gallon at a
minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from mileage, the Power Stroke diesel is a torque monster.
The 7.3-liter direct-injection power plant, while only rated at 235
horsepower, produces an incredible 500 foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer a Crew Cab configuration to an extended-cab pickup,
even though extended cabs are all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't have ``real'' rear doors. Most manufacturers have
two rear panels that open ``suicide'' fashion _ front to rear.
Regardless of what their marketing claims are, I have yet to find
an extended-cab truck in which I would want to ride in the rear
seat further than to dinner. If you are 10 or under, it might be
acceptable. There is inadequate legroom, the seat back is usually
too straight up and the seat bottom too short.
</P>
<P>
   I know you are already thinking those Crew Cabs are such
monstrous vehicles. But an F-350 4x2 SuperCab has a wheelbase of
158.0 inches; the Crew Cab counterpart when equipped with a short
bed is 156.2 inches; the long bed is 172.4 inches.
</P>
<P>
   It has been my experience that when you are driving something as
big as any of these trucks, 10 or 12 more inches is pretty much
academic.
</P>
<P>
   The real plus is in interior space and ease of entry and exit.
The SuperCab has 32.4 inches of rear legroom, while the Crew Cab
offers 42.5 inches. For comparison, a Lincoln Town Car has a
minimum of 41.1 inches. In the back seat of the F-350 Crew Cab, you
feel like you are in a concert hall.

   Extended-cab trucks have almost claustrophobic back seats. With
the Crew Cab you also get strategically positioned grab handles.
</P>
<P>
   My test F-350 was equipped with the Lariat package, which meant
full leather and all the bells and whistles. Having traveled more
than 7,000 miles in a Lincoln Navigator vs. about 3,000 in the
F-350, I found the ride quality of the F-350 superior. Most of that
can be attributed to the Navigator's 119-inch wheelbase vs. 172.4
in the F-350.
</P>
<P>
   The test F-350 was just under $40,000 with the $3,000 Power
Stroke and 4x4 options. Many dressed-out extended-cab 4x2 pick-ups
with gasoline motors can be close to that price.

COMPUTER FORTUNE HEIR GAMBLES ON ONE CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California, what a country.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a first-grade teacher in Santa Ana got a call from an
heir to one of the world's greatest computer fortunes. They'd never
met before.
</P>
<P>
   David Woodley Packard took Gloria Matta Tuchman to dinner in
Palo Alto, afterwards playing the organ for her at the Stanford
Theater he had renovated. Then he gave her $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't an episode of ``The Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a political contribution from a man who says he's
apolitical. ``I once gave $1,000 to Tom Campbell, but that was
because my dear dad suggested I should,'' Packard, 58, said. ``And
Tom is a good man.''
</P>
<P>
   Packard thinks Matta Tuchman, a Republican, is a good candidate
for state superintendent of public instruction. He doesn't like the
current school boss, Delaine Eastin, a Democrat, whom he calls a
``career politician.''
</P>
<P>
   How did Packard find out about Matta Tuchman? ``Well, she was
just running against Delaine, that's enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eastin's response to the half-million dollar contribution was:
``Is this what public service has come to? Selling off public
offices to billionaires? I hope not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I'm not a billionaire,'' Packard said.
</P>
<P>
   Half a mil means TV, and means Matta Tuchman has at least half a
chance against Eastin, who until recently had twice as much
campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest chunk reported at the end of September by Eastin was
$100,000 from the California Teachers Association, one of the
``special interests'' Packard said he wanted to counter.
</P>
<P>
   Matta Tuchman was overjoyed at getting Packard's record-setting
contribution, the largest to any candidate in any race. ``It's
amazing,'' she said. ``I'm finally going to get my face and voice
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week this Latina co-author of the anti-bilingual education
Proposition 227 was busy making Spanish-language commercials. She
also had made a TV commercial in English.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad Matta Tuchman walks through a classroom, promising
that every child will read by third grade, all instruction will be
in English, and there will be zero tolerance for gangs in schools.
Mr. Rogers-type music plays in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the ultimate goal of campaign reform is to bring
candidates' messages to the voters equally, then I guess we have
just been reformed,'' said Matta Tuchman's campaign manager, Jon
Fleischman. ``It's instant playing-field levelization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be more like instant demonization for me,'' Packard
said. ``A lot of my friends say I won't be able to walk down the
street to my theater again.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, it was reported that pro-Matta Tuchman fliers
had been released showing that Eastin had been endorsed by gay
groups and San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown. Eastin said that this
was an appeal to racism and homophobia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to figure this whole thing out,'' Packard said. ``I
can't believe Gloria's campaign would do this. That's not her.''
</P>
<P>
   Matta Tuchman said the fliers were not racist or homophobic. ``I
don't look at people in terms of color, creed or sexual
orientation,'' she said. ``In Pecos, Texas, I wasn't allowed to go
to certain theaters, restaurants or swimming pools because I was
Mexican-American.''
</P>
<P>
   California, what a country. She's the anti-bilingual education
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Packard says he's not a right-wing Christian, but just
interested in education. The Packard Foundation has spent millions
in the last two years experimenting with the Open Court phonics
system in school districts all over California.
</P>
<P>
   Each teacher gets a coach in the classroom, plenty of workshops
and easily decodable books for children to take home. Packard
doesn't like the word ``phonics'' because ``it sounds like `going
back.''' He prefers ``decoding.''
</P>
<P>
   Packard, who has a doctorate in Greek from Harvard, explained
that he got interested in teaching reading when he was unable to
learn Hebrew from a professor who expected students to figure out
the language inductively, in a whole-language method. He said he
didn't learn any Hebrew until he had a professor who taught letters
and decoding explicitly.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Packard taught Greek as a professor at the University
of California at Los Angeles, the University of North Carolina and
University College, London.
</P>
<P>
   Matta Tuchman is not an intellectual powerhouse, but she is
proud of being dogged. She fought bilingual education for a decade
before her Proposition 227 passed. She did it because ``bilingual
education keeps kids from learning English.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the way she talks is back-to-basics.
</P>
<P>
   Packard says: ``She's sensible. She's been there. She teaches
kids other people would give up on. She can face the bureaucracy.
At least she can get people who can deal with the bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if you think you can get a political contribution
from Packard, forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to give anybody else any money,'' he said.
``This is a very special case.''
</P>
<P>
   Packard is sticking to his theater: ``That's my true educational
mission in this world. If kids see Audrey Hepburn, Jimmy Stewart
and Fred Astaire, they'll turn out to be good people.''
</P>
<P>
   California, what a country.

THE IRS MEETS ITS MATCH: A RETIRED MARINE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Here, for your reading pleasure, is another
example of ``Your Tax Dollars at Work.''
</P>
<P>
   And a scary one, too.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Corkrey is 51. He lives in the Albany suburb of Nassau. He
spent 13 years in the Marines, much of that in Vietnam. Eleven
years ago, he got a part-time job teaching scuba diving for the
adult education program in a suburban school district. They paid
him $351 for teaching the course.
</P>
<P>
   That was a tough year for Corkrey. His marriage was going bad.
By the time April 1988 rolled around _ when he would normally file
his income tax return _ he was out of the house and unable to get
his hands on his financial records. Also, since he was making about
30 grand a year and normally got a tax refund, he decided not to
file. Corkrey was having big personal problems. The government
could keep his piddling refund.
</P>
<P>
   Same thing the next year. Still nothing but problems. Corkrey
didn't file then, either.
</P>
<P>
   Then he remarried. His new wife, Megan, told him that he ought
to get that tax thing straightened out. So he contacted the
Internal Revenue Service and asked for whatever financial records
they had on him for those years.
</P>
<P>
   Which they sent him _ along with a bill for taxes, interest and
penalties to the tune of $52,657.21. Corkrey almost popped a blood
vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began a huge fight with the IRS, a hugely stressful one
that inflicted enough emotional damage on Corkrey that he landed in
a veteran's hospital for 45 days. On one of those days, when they
let him out for some relaxation, he dropped by the IRS office,
hoping to work this out. The collector he saw ordered him to empty
his pockets. The government wanted every dime he was carrying at
that moment.
</P>
<P>
   Before this ended, Corkrey's bank accounts were frozen. His
paychecks were grabbed. And his new wife had to declare bankruptcy,
since her money got grabbed, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been able to own anything in years,'' Corkrey said.
``My credit is ruined.''
</P>
<P>
   He finally figured out what had happened. He had his W-2 from
the Burnt Hills school district, which showed that he'd been paid
$351 to teach that course. But the IRS had somehow managed to
record it as $35,100. And they'd insisted that this was the real
figure, regardless of what the W-2 form said.
</P>
<P>
   Corkrey spent big bucks on an accounting firm to straighten this
out for him. The IRS wouldn't budge. Finally, he hired Phil
Vecchio, a tax lawyer in the Albany suburb of East Greenbush.
Ultimately, the IRS admitted the mistake and settled for $276 in
tax, interest and penalties from those years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd hit him with a sledgehammer,'' Vecchio said. ``This is
not an organization with a highly developed sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Corkrey doesn't have the best sense of humor in the
world, either. He's a trim, well-spoken guy with a pepper-and-salt
beard. But he went through a lot in Vietnam, and this ordeal on top
of all that has left him with a certain level of paranoia
concerning the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   So now Corkrey is suing the IRS. For defamation, legal fees,
credit damage and general grief, he wants $725,000. I spoke to the
IRS lawyer handling this. Can't talk, he said. Corkrey, though,
feels that his fight with the IRS is pure patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has got to be stopped,'' he said. ``But I wouldn't be
surprised in the Men in Black were all over me after this.''

PATAKI REMAINS TOO DISTANT FROM THE PRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ What a difference four years make. George E.
Pataki running for governor in 1994 was a virtual stealth
candidate, whose long suit turned out to be, as all now know, not
what he was, but who he wasn't: the incumbent Mario M. Cuomo, whose
public support had worn thin after 12 years in office.
</P>
<P>
   As a tactic, candidate Pataki limited his public exposures,
especially to the press. He struck us then as being on the stiff
side, with a coiled defensiveness that suggested that he viewed
questioning as inherently hostile.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that he could not demonstrate a good grasp of state
issues. To the contrary, on that score he was impressive. At the
same time, he conveyed an impression that he felt that by meeting
face-to-face with editors and reporters he was exposing himself to
a process that bode him no good.
</P>
<P>
   For much of his first four years in office, Pataki remained more
remote than his eminent position warranted. All the while, however,
he was radically changing the direction in which New York state was
heading, as he had promised he would.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Albany Times Union editorial board last
week, he was at ease, addressing questions with fact-filled
answers. Not surprisingly, in his fourth year in office, he
demonstrated an even more comprehensive grasp of the details of
governance. Yet, more striking, was his manner, which differed
markedly from the personality we had faced previously.
</P>
<P>
   This time he was plainly comfortable, sitting back in his chair,
his legs crossed, amiably voluble. Occasionally, he trotted out
heavy irony, even flashes of formerly rare humor, to defuse what he
surely regarded as a question reflecting charges made by campaign
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   For his explicit responses he relied on what he carried in his
head. He had no paper work with him to buttress his presentation.
The sole press aide accompanying him was not called on for
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The man obviously felt on top of his game and secure, as well he
might be given his huge lead the pollsters have measured.
</P>
<P>
   Showing that earlier rivalries had not faded with time, he
contrasted the tenor of his responses with those of Cuomo. He was
dismissive of his predecessor's fondness for rhetoric and
abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   In that, Pataki was partially accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo was brilliant outlining the big picture. But he could bury
a questioner with massive doses of data, some of which he recited
with total self-confidence from memory.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, Cuomo consulted the contents of a thick binder
in front of him. Several aides sprinkled throughout the room could
provide specific expertise.
</P>
<P>
   At times, he had one aide sitting next to him, poised over a
laptop computer punching up information as the dialogue with the
journalists was going on.
</P>
<P>
   But the sharpest difference between the Cuomo style and that of
the latter-day Pataki was that Cuomo dominated the entire editorial
board. His answers could go on and on, and efforts to break-in with
follow-up questions were disdainfully disregarded.
</P>
<P>
   He also personalized his remarks, constantly challenging his
questioners, exposing them for not matching his comprehensive grasp
of the details, and belittling their knowledge when they could.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Cuomo presented his arguments in moralistic terms,
which left dissenters laden with the burden of ethical
insufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuomo's visits were always great fun, eagerly anticipated.
His ploys and debating gamesmanship were marveled at and enjoyed,
although extracting a simple answer from him was frequently
daunting.
</P>
<P>
   In their approaches to editorial boards, Governors Pataki and
Cuomo vastly differ. For all that, their willingness to open
themselves to close questioning is an essential ingredient of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   These encounters are so valuable that Pataki, who has developed
his own self-confident style, should overcome his continuing
reluctance, and meet the press much more often, as befits a person
beginning to be touted for national office.

   &UR; Expanded Health and Fitness Coverage in Science Times &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Editors, attention science, health, features editors.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, The New York Times News Service increased
its coverage of health and fitness. The increase reflected The
Times's seven-coumn expansion of its Tuesday Science Times section.
</P>
<P>
   This new section-within-a-section, about 12 columns in all,
takes as its purview stories and standing features in the following
areas:
</P>
<P>
   _ General medical features with a practical orientation
</P>
<P>
   _ Nutrition and diet
</P>
<P>
   _ Fitness, including features for novices
</P>
<P>
   _ The healthcare system from a patient's point of view
</P>
<P>
   _ Behavior, including child-rearing.
</P>
<P>
   These stories are listed under a separate heading, HEALTH &AMP;
FITNESS, in the SCIENCE-TIMES-BUDGET on Monday afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   Among the columns and standard features is the every-week
SCI-BRODY-HEALTH, The Personal Health column by Jane E. Brody.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, these standard features will move on an occasional
basis:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-NOVICE _ Various fitness programs (rock climbing,
rowing, etc.) from a beginner's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FIT-BODIES _ Short: How particular regimens affect the body.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEALTH-NOSTRUMS _ Short: Traditional health wisdom in the
light of modern research.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEALTH-PRO&AMP;CON _ Short: Two experts with opposing views on a
health question.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEALTH-RX-MONEY _ Short: Help with getting the most from
your health dollar.
</P>
<P>
   And every week:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Shorts on health and fitness.
</P>
<P>
   The space alloted to The Times's coverage of science and the
environment remains the same, about 25 columns in Science Times on
Tuesdays and space as needed throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
   All Science stories, including the new material, have a slugline
of the form BC-SCI-SLUG-NYT and carry an ``a'' general news
category code for newsroom computer sorting.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the weekly computer column has moved from ScienceTimes to
the Circuits section on Thursday. Written by Peter H. Lewis, it
will be filed Wednesday afternoon with the slug
CIR-COMPUTER-COLUMN.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Signing of peace pact should not be sold short.
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   And now for the hard part, so only a muted and brief huzzah,
please, for the agreement that was pulled, like a molar with roots
of steel, from the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations at Wye River.
</P>
<P>
   These relatively modest gains in the Oslo process took 19 months
of public dithering and nine days of closeted head-knocking to
cobble together. Imagine the difficulty of composing the end-game
issues _ final boundaries, the nature of a Palestinian state,
Palestinian refugee rights, the status of Jerusalem, water.
</P>
<P>
   Still, though the achievements of recent days shouldn't be
over-sold, neither should they be sold short.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement adds solid blocks to the foundation for further
talks _ new assurances and means for Israeli security and
significant additional land concessions to the Palestinians. The
symbolic gestures matter, too _ Israel's release of Palestinian
prisoners and the Yasser Arafat's pledge finally to see the
Palestinian National Charter scrubbed of its provision calling for
the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Count that concession by Arafat as the official end of the
fantasies that have plagued Palestinian policy long past the time
when they had become plainly untenable. Similarly, the signature of
the hang-back conservative government of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on the deal is another splash of cold water _ after
Netanyahu earlier gutted out Hebron's release _ on Israeli
fantasies of a return to ancient Samaria and Judea.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of wrapping up a final, permanent settlement by next
May, as Oslo calls for, are somewhere in the range of one in
whatever comes after a trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis by a large margin durably favor peace, but it likely
will take another election _ in 2000, if the tense Netanyahu
coalition hangs on that long _ to arrange a government that's able
to go the last mile.
</P>
<P>
   This interim step at least should make cautious but useful
progress toward a final settlement possible in the meantime.
Crucially, it reaffirms the United States as equally a friend of
Israel and an honest broker, the more so with the novel
arrangements for the CIA to act as a security guarantor and
go-between. (Expect no end of congressional fussing over that one.)
</P>
<P>
   Too, Netanyahu's willingness and ability to drag the dead weight
of rejectionist wannabe Ariel Sharon into concurrence is a
promising sign, as was Israel's refusal to let an 11th-hour
terrorist attack by Hamas succeed in killing the talks. Both sides
will have to grit through more attempts by their ultras to blow up
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye accords challenge Netanyahu to show that he has the
political will and ability to produce in his Likud party a
realistic reconciliation to the peace part of the peace with
security that he promised in his election campaign. And the
agreement challenges Arafat to demonstrate, in what is probably his
last chance, that his Palestinian authority can be an able partner
with Israel in security matters.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have, in effect, put themselves on probation. And with
them, the very peace process itself.

   Firing a special bullet into the ground from a helicopter could
pinpoint buried landmines, say researchers in Missouri. The bullet
emits a radar pulse as it grinds to a halt, offering a safe and
efficient way of finding landmines. And it could help geologists
surveying for oil, minerals and other buried natural resources.

<P>
   Ground-penetrating radar is potentially one of the most accurate
ways of finding landmines. A radar transmits pulses of radio waves
into the ground, and a computer analyzes their reflections. But
little radiation penetrates the soil _ most is reflected by the
ground because of the sudden change in density between the air and
the soil. This means that ground radars need a large power supply
to generate pulses intense enough to penetrate the ground. This
makes the system bulky _a major problem since most minefields are
in remote parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   To get round these limits, electrical engineers Thomas Engel and
William Nunnally at the University of Missouri at Columbia, with $5
million in funding from the U.S. Army, designed a bullet that gives
out a powerful burst of radio waves from under the ground.
Eventually, the researchers say, the bullet will be fired downward
from a gun mounted in a helicopter flying about 100 meters above
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The bullet will produce a pulse of radio waves as it pierces the
ground, and the signals reflected from any landmines within about a
15-meter radius will be detected by an antenna on the helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be on the ground _ stepping on mines _ to
use it,'' says Engel. Once the mines are located, they can be
destroyed at once or their exact position noted so they can be
dealt with later. Of course, a mine would explode if the bullet
hits it.
</P>
<P>
   The radar pulse is generated from the bullet's kinetic energy by
a process known as magnetic flux compression. Inside the bullet is
a solid metal cylinder, surrounded by a tightly wound coil of wire.
As the bullet leaves the gun, a battery passes a current through
the coil, generating a magnetic field in the cylinder.
</P>
<P>
   When the bullet smashes into the ground, the sudden deceleration
forces the cylinder out from inside the coil. In much the same way
that moving a wire through a magnetic field generates an electrical
current in the wire, the sudden movement of the metal cylinder
through the magnetic field induces a large pulse of current in the
coil. The coil then acts like an antenna, converting the pulse into
a short burst of high frequency radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The lightweight system can be fitted to any helicopter. And in
tests, Engel has found their 30 millimeter bullet gives out a 4
kilowatt radar pulse _ almost 10 times more power than a standard
ground _ penetrating radar-from 20 centimeters down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the bullet is beneath the surface, it transmits more
radio waves into the ground,'' Engel says. &QL;

NELSON A. ROCKEFELLER CENTER FOR LATIN AMERICAN ART OPENS IN SAN
ANTONIO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATRICIA C. JOHNSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ The Nelson A. Rockefeller Center for Latin
American Art, which opened Saturday, is a welcoming, light-filled
space housing art from many nations and 30 centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The 30,000-square-foot, $11 million addition to the San Antonio
Museum of Art contains about 2,500 works of folk, pre-Columbian,
viceregal and contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   Although at this juncture it is only an exhibition hall, the
center's third story eventually will house a library, research
facilities, seminar rooms and space for visiting scholars.
</P>
<P>
   It was named for the late U.S. vice president and New York
governor in recognition of contributions by his family to the
center and to the museum's collections. Just as important, the
museum explains, the name also serves ``as a memorial to
Rockefeller's steadfast efforts to gain understanding and
recognition of Latin American culture in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller's love affair with art from south of the Rio Grande
began on his first visit to Mexico in 1933. Over the years, he
amassed great collections of pre-Columbian, modern and folk art. He
gave the pre-Columbian material to the Metropolitan Museum of Art
in New York, which incorporated it into the Michael Rockefeller
wing, named for one of his sons. Most of his contemporary
paintings, including those by Latin American artists, went to the
Museum of Modern Art, where he had served as board president.
</P>
<P>
   The great majority of his folk art collection, an estimated
2,500 pieces, was presented as a gift to SAMA in 1985 by his
daughter, Ann R. Roberts. Considered to be the premier collection
of its kind in the world, it spans five decades and forms the core
of the museum's folk art holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Museum regulars will undoubtedly be familiar with most of the
works on view. But in the center's fresh galleries, select objects
have more space and the potential to create intriguing, even
surprising consonances. Marion Oettinger, SAMA's senior curator,
designed the massive display with grace.
</P>
<P>
   The collection is divided into four primary areas on two of the
new wing's three floors. Folk and pre-Columbian art are on the
ground floor, just past the orientation gallery; works from the
colonial to modern period are on the second story. There are
powerful echoes from the majestic traveling exhibition ``Mexico:
Splendors of Thirty Centuries,'' which SAMA hosted in 1991. Segues
are smooth, for the most part, as one travels from the austere
stone idols carved by Olmec artisans to the ebullient baroque works
brought by the viceregal Spanish court, and from the rich hybrids
of the colonial period to the modern artists' multifaceted
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few stumbles. Contemporary New Mexico carver Felipe
Archuleta doesn't have much reason to be in a Latin American
collection, no matter how charming his creations, and the modern
works are pretty weak, including an insipid painting by Diego
Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   But the highlights are generous.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors enter the L-shaped center through the three-story,
translucent orientation gallery. It houses interactive computers
(funded by Rockefeller's sons, Mark and Nelson Jr., whose
inheritance included a ranch in South Texas) with general
information on Latin American culture, history and religion, and
specifics about the collection.
</P>
<P>
   High above, in a protective niche, a colonial stone image of the
Virgin of San Juan de los Lagos stands with arms in a gesture of
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition galleries then open with richly colored walls and
design elements intended to enhance content.
</P>
<P>
   Folk art comes first, displayed in rooms of deep burgundy-rust
walls and doorways topped by heavy wooden lintels. Oettinger
arranged the works in three distinct though permeable areas _
ceremonial objects, utilitarian ones and playful things.
</P>
<P>
   While overall quality is beyond reproach, a few items stand out
for beauty and uniqueness, including a mandolin from the 1930s with
its armadillo shell body and a painted front. There's a terrific
19th-century figure of a seated monkey wearing a hat, carved from
blond wood, and animated from the smile on his simian face to his
slender, almost human fingers.
</P>
<P>
   A tin gazebo populated by clay musicians from around 1900
anchors one end of a display. At the other is Rockefeller's famous
``Garza'' (crane), probably from the 1930s, in which the anonymous
artist from Olinala, Mexico, extracted the graceful semblance of
the long-legged bird from a gourd.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-Columbian space, with entrances cut like Maya arches,
offers exceptional variety and quality. Works in clay, stone and
copper from Mexico to Peru reflect the civilization and
craftsmanship that pre-dated the arrival of the Spanish in the
beginning of the 16th century. There's a Zapotec urn circa 300 B.C.
in black clay, and a Toltec stone figure, circa 900 B.C., of a
deity with knotted ropes around her waist and feathered serpents
around her eyes and mouth.
</P>
<P>
   A polychrome Maya platter, circa A.D. 600, from Peten (in
Guatemala) of a ruler smoking a cigar and sitting on a jaguar
throne is among the most famous works of its kind. A very fine
tripod ``metate'' (grinding stone) from Costa Rica, with its
fretwork base, and an exquisite Mixtec mask from around 1500, with
features covered by diminutive turquoise ``tesserae'' and
mother-of-pearl fangs, speak of highly skilled artists.
</P>
<P>
   The colonial and republican collections, presented in
cream-colored, vaulted-arch spaces, include decorative, religious
and utilitarian pieces. This is the period least well-known and
-understood, as complicated historically as it is aesthetically.
The excesses of the viceregal court and the wealth of the Catholic
Church were in ample evidence during the 17th and 18th centuries,
with baroque and churrigueresque styles developing throughout
Spanish America. Neoclassicism, with its sober forms and clear
lines, appears in the mid-19th century as the colonies plunge into
wars of independence.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a tiny 18th-century Christ with Asian features. It
represents the ocean trade that connected the Spanish crown with
its possessions in Asia and New Spain. The Manila-Acapulco route
established in 1565 increased trade with China, where this figure
probably was made.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights range from a beautiful silver incense burner in
the shape of an armadillo from 18th-century Peru, to a charming,
1860 primitive painting of the Cathedral in Mexico City by an
anonymous artist, to the celebrated statue of Santa Teresa de Avila
from Guatemala. Dating from the 17th century, this extraordinary
figure stands about one-half life-size, her sumptuous gown one of
the foremost examples of ``estofado,'' a Spanish technique in which
the outermost coat of paint is punched to reveal the gold leaf
underneath.
</P>
<P>
   The last section, on modern and contemporary art, is a letdown.
Although some big names are here _ Rivera, Rufino Tamayo, even
Frida Kahlo from the early part of the century _ it's a feeble
gathering. And it doesn't improve with contemporaries such as
Alejandro Colunga and Vicente Rojo.
</P>
<P>
   But as visitors wend their way back to the main floor, some
interesting relationships emerge. Several of the 20th-century
pieces point the viewer back to earlier pictures, from which the
artists took their clues. Two notable examples are Carlos Merida's
illustrative watercolors of costumes and market scenes _ which
relate directly to ``pintura costumbrista,'' the character study
painting of the 19th century. Kahlo's still life painting of fruit
with its brilliant green parrot is a direct descendant of the nave
painting by an unknown artist in the folk art gallery.
</P>
<P>
   It's a satisfying circle.

DUTCH HYACINTH BULBS OFFER FRAGRANCE, BRIGHT APPEARANCE FOR
HOLIDAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With its heady fragrance and formal appearance, the Dutch
hyacinth comes dressed for holiday affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Although poinsettias are a mainstay for that special time of the
year, bulbs are becoming increasingly popular, and the Dutch
hyacinth is excellent for forcing into bloom for winter
celebrations. The plump bulbs can be grown in pots of soil or in
special hyacinth forcing glasses. Each bulb produces one flower
spike; the larger the bulb, the bigger the bloom spike. The dense
spikes range from 6 to 10 inches tall and are loaded with waxy
blooms in blue, violet, red, pink, salmon, yellow or the popular
white. Spikes can become so heavily laden with blooms that staking
is required.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch types can also be planted in the garden in November or
December for spring blooms.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're going to plant Dutch hyacinths in the garden, in
a pot or forced on a water glass, the bulbs need chilling time in
the refrigerator. Hyacinth bulbs can cause skin rashes, so wear
gloves while handling. Store the bulbs on a refrigerator shelf in a
mesh bag or nylon stocking. Do not store them with fruits and
vegetables, as the ethylene gas produced by these foods can damage
or kill the buds within each bulb.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forcing bulbs over water &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forcing over water in a special cinched glass is the quickest
way to bring a hyacinth into bloom for the holidays. Flowers occur
four to six weeks after the forcing is started. Hyacinths were the
rage during the Victorian Age, and today's readily available
hyacinth forcing glasses resemble those that filled Victorian
cabinets years ago.
</P>
<P>
   To force over water:
</P>
<P>
   Place a few pieces of agricultural charcoal (available at garden
centers or stores that sell fish supplies) in the forcing glass.
This will keep the water clean and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Select a large, firm bulb and place it on the small, upper
section of the glass container; add water just to the bottom of the
bulb.
</P>
<P>
   Place the container in a dark area where the temperature is in
the 40-to 50-degree range. You might place the hyacinth in an
unheated garage or return the bulb to the refrigerator, but do not
let it freeze. Leave the bulb until the root system is
well-developed and top growth has begun. During this period,
maintain the water level at the base of the bulb.
</P>
<P>
   When the root system reaches the bottom of the glass and the top
growth is 2 to 4 inches tall, remove from cool storage and cover
the growth and glass with an inverted paper sack or an open-top
black paper cone to encourage a longer stem. During the next three
to four days, gradually move the glass from low to brighter light
and where temperatures do not exceed 70 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the sack or cone when the bud begins to show color, and
again move the hyacinth to brighter, indirect light. Turn the glass
a bit each day so that the flowers do not lean to one side.
</P>
<P>
   Remember to watch the water level and add water when needed.
Flowers will last longer with cool night temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Water-forced hyacinths should be discarded after bloom.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Potted bulbs &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can purchase potted bulbs at many florists, garden centers
or grocery stores during the holidays. Or you can pot your own in a
well-draining container. You can use a terra-cotta pot and slip it
into a decorative cache pot for party presentation. Individual
bulbs are available at local nurseries and garden centers.
</P>
<P>
   As in the garden, potted hyacinths look best in mass. Plant one
plump bulb in a 4-inch pot and group several of these pots in a
basket to create a more dramatic effect. Or plant three plump bulbs
in a 5- or 6-inch pot. Plant the bulbs with the tips right at the
soil line and bottoms down on a layer of sand in a good,
well-draining potting medium. Mix in 1 teaspoon of bone meal per 6
inches of pot. Water well.
</P>
<P>
   Place the container in a cool, (40- to 50-degree) dark place _
an unheated garage or the refrigerator. Keep the medium moist but
not too wet. Roots will form and grow during this cool treatment.
In six to eight weeks, when you see approximately 4 inches of
growth emerging from the bulbs, move the pot to a brighter, warmer
area with temperatures in the 60- to 70-degree range. The cooler
the temperature, the better the bloom. Again, when the buds begin
to show color, move to brighter light, but avoid direct sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the container every few days to encourage straight stalks.
Water as needed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Garden hyacinths &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dutch hyacinths can be planted in the garden during November and
December in sun or partial sun in an organically enriched,
well-draining soil. Cover the tips of the bulbs with 2 inches of
soil.
</P>
<P>
   Some will naturalize and, as they do, lose their rigid
appearance to resemble the more informal single hyacinth.
</P>
<P>
   The old-fashioned, graceful Roman hyacinths and single, informal
multiflora hyacinths also do well here in containers or in the
garden. &QL;

ELECTION YEAR DRUM BEATING AGAINST CRIME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Reviewing political history, especially during an
election season, can be a risky proposition _ for politicians and
columnists alike.
</P>
<P>
   Often, opponents for office will remember _ or try to portray _
the same events differently, as Democrat John Sharp and Republican
Rick Perry have done in their brawl for lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   An already ugly race turned uglier last week with a new Sharp
television commercial blaming Perry _ because of a vote Perry cast
in the Texas House years ago _ for the early release of a prison
inmate who later raped and killed a 15-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   Perry hotly disputed the accusation and tried to turn the tables
on Sharp by contending the convict actually was released because of
a different bill that Sharp had voted for _ also years ago _ in the
state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not going to try to referee their dispute, except to say
that it's ridiculous to think of either of these two candidates as
soft on crime and beyond ridiculous to think that either would have
intentionally endangered anyone.
</P>
<P>
   But both Sharp and Perry _ and most other lawmakers who served
in the 1980s _ voted at one time or another for key bills that had
the effect of speeding up the releases of inmates to keep the
prison system from becoming overcrowded and the state being held in
contempt of a federal court order.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators _ and a couple of former governors who signed the
bills _ thought that they were doing the best they could under the
circumstances. But some of the convicts who were released early
did, indeed, rob, rape and kill people soon after they were
returned to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Those were dark days for Texas' criminal justice system. They
were precipitated in large parts by a federal court order clamping
population limits on an overloaded state prison system and by a
recession that made it difficult to raise enough money to improve
it.
</P>
<P>
   The order by U.S. District Judge William Wayne Justice, which
also required the state to improve staffing, medical care and other
prison programs, was controversial. Many state leaders argued that
Justice had gone too far in addressing complaints raised by inmates
in the so-called Ruiz prison reform lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remained that state leaders had neglected their own
responsibilities and had allowed Texas prisons to deteriorate to
the point that a federal judge determined that conditions in them
had become unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The state began struggling with the Ruiz order in the early
1980s, about the time the state economy started slowing down and
lawmakers soon had to start raising taxes to routinely balance the
state budget.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't a lot of extra money to spend on prisons, and some
state officials preferred to demagogue on the issue rather than
adequately address it. They accused the federal judge of ordering
``country club'' prisons and ``coddling'' criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature reacted in 1983 by passing the Prison Management
Act, which provided a way of automatically releasing inmates early
when the prisons began to get too crowded. Sharp voted for that law
as a state senator that year, and Perry voted for a revision of it
as a state representative in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   That law, some revisions to it and generous good-time credits,
which the Legislature also allowed inmates to accumulate to speed
up their release dates _ plus liberal parole policies _ eventually
turned the prison system into something of a revolving door.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of inmates were released early, many to end up back in
prison for new offenses or parole violations only weeks or months
later. Most of those convicts were nonviolent, drug or property
offenders, but others were dangerous and soon produced tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp and Perry weren't engineers of this early release policy.
But, like most of their legislative colleagues, they went along
with it because it bought the state some time, reduced the size of
tax bills that their constituents didn't want to pay and allowed
the Legislature to claim it was still ``tough'' on crime.
</P>
<P>
   The state finally managed to resolve the overcrowding and early
release problem _ at least for now _ by issuing hundreds of
millions of dollars of voter-approved bonds to build one of the
largest prison systems in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that huge construction program was conducted under
former Gov. Ann Richards, but Republican George W. Bush still
managed to use the anti-crime issue against Richards when he
unseated her in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians love to beat the drums against crime, but it can be
a dicey issue for anyone who has ever been in a position of
responsibility to do something about it.

GERMINATING INDOORS CITRUS, STORE-BOUGHT SEEDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I am a seventh-grade student and am researching the
possibility of citrus and other store-bought fruit seeds
germinating indoors and outdoors. I would appreciate any
information you could provide me about this subject.
</P>
<P>
   A: There are a number of grocery store fruits that can be
started from seed. Many germinate rather easily and are enjoyed as
house plants or as container plants on the deck. Some may end up
planted in the ground. Fruits that tolerate cold weather such as
apples and pears are grown outdoors. Tender fruits enjoy the fresh
air, too, but you will need to provide protection during cold
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Seeds vary in the amount of light needed to germinate. Some
prefer darkness, and therefore, are covered with soil when planted.
Others like more light to germinate and are sown closer to the top
or on top of the soil. If you don't know the planting depth a seed
needs, experiment by planting at varying depths, but never plant
too deep. Temperature needs vary, too. Some seeds want warmth.
Others need a period of cold before they will germinate. Water and
oxygen also influence germination. A seed needs water to grow.
Oxygen, too, is a must to unlock the seed. That's why it is
important to use a soil that drains well when sowing seed.
Otherwise, water would take up all the ``air'' spaces within the
soil for too great a period and the seed will rot.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh seeds from semitropical citrus _ oranges, lemons and
grapefruit, for example _ germinate fairly easily. Lemons sometimes
sprout more quickly than the other two. Fill as many 4-inch pots as
needed with a well-draining seed soil mix. Moisten. The pots must
be clean and have drainage holes in the bottom. Sow fresh seeds
from an orange, lemon or grapefruit 1/2 to 1 inch deep.
</P>
<P>
   Place the pots in a bright area where the temperature is in the
77- to 90-degree range. In late fall and winter, this means
indoors. You can sow the seed outdoors in a raised bed of
well-draining soil in spring. Keep the soil moist, but not soggy or
the seeds will rot. Be patient. In warm temperatures, seeds can
sprout in two weeks, but sometimes an orange, for example, will
take six weeks to germinate. It would be fun to sow orange, lemon
and grapefruit seed and note germination times and document the
rate of each seedling's growth.
</P>
<P>
   If you wish, you can keep the seedlings, repotting them into
larger containers as they grow. Sun and water are, of course, the
most important requirements. They will grow indoors, but will
prosper outdoors in fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the citrus seed comes true-to-type; that is, the new
plant is like the mother plant and the fruit the seedling tree
bears will be of the quality of the mother plant. But seedling
trees can produce less-than-quality fruit; therefore, the trees we
buy in nurseries are grafted trees to ensure good-tasting fruit. In
this case, a superior top is grafted onto a hardy root system.
</P>
<P>
   Seedlings that aren't true-to-type can be thorny, too. Seedlings
can take many years _ 10 to 15 _ to bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Citrus trees will thrive outdoors in the warmth of the sun. It
can be easier to protect some container-grown pots during freezing
weather. If you eventually plant a citrus in the garden, you must
be prepared to protect it during a hard freeze. Plant on the south
side of the house in a protected area. Good drainage is critical.
</P>
<P>
   The seed of many tropical fruits need to be planted immediately
or they will dry out. This is especially true in the case of
avocados. An avocado is easy to grow as a houseplant, but it will
soon become large. A popular technique is to stick three toothpicks
in the side of the avocado pit and suspend it in a glass with the
bottom quarter inch in water. This gives you the opportunity to see
the root grow down into the water. Then you can transplant to a pot
with soil.
</P>
<P>
   But you might prefer to simply plant the pit in the soil from
the beginning. Carefully peel off the brown seed coat of a fresh
avocado pit and plant the seed in a 6-inch container (with a
drainage hole) filled with a good potting soil. Leave about one
half of the seed protruding from the soil _ the pointed end up.
Keep the soil moist, but not overly wet, and don't allow it to dry
out.
</P>
<P>
   Be patient. It may take a month or much more for the avocado
sprout to emerge. By this time, it may be warm enough outside for
you to give your new houseplant the benefit of a summer's growth
outdoors before you bring it in next winter. Transplant to a larger
container as needed. Some gardeners plant avocado plants in the
garden and protect during winter as long as the plant is a
manageable size. Some years, however, freezes damage the tops. Some
gardeners eventually report their trees bear fruit. But the trees
usually must reach 35 feet before they will produce good crops.
</P>
<P>
   Mangos are less cold tolerant than the avocado. Remove the pulp
from fresh seed. To speed up germination, soak for several hours
and carefully remove the seed coat. Sow immediately. Place the
seed, convex side up, in a 6-inch pot filled with potting soil.
Cover lightly. Place in a sunny, warm area. Water and water again
when the soil dries. The seed may take a few weeks to several
months to germinate. Plant more than one seed. In order to bear,
the mango must grow outdoors _ in a warm, protected area. Mangos
cause a rash on some people.
</P>
<P>
   Papaya is a tender, exotic fruit, native to tropical America,
that is hardy to about 25 degrees. Local gardeners sometimes plant
seed from store-bought papayas, and sometimes report success
growing fruit. Many plants bear male and female flowers, but some
bear blooms of just one sex. Papayas can bear within a year and a
half after being planted from seed.
</P>
<P>
   You can also sow apple, peach, pear and plum seed from grocery
store fruit, but the seed from these need a cold, moist treatment
known as stratification before they will germinate. You can sow
fresh seed outdoors in the fall and nature will provide this
treatment during the winter months. Next spring you should find
some seedlings. Germination will probably not be 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   You can provide this cold-moist treatment yourself by placing
the fresh seeds in a bag of damp sphagnum moss. Tie the bag and
refrigerate. Occasionally check to make sure the moss has not dried
out. In about three months plant the seeds _ carefully, so you
won't damage any tiny roots.
</P>
<P>
   The pineapple, a member of the bromeliad family, can be
propagated by simply slicing off the top of the fruit. It may take
you three or four years, but if you'd like to try growing a
pineapple, buy a fruit that still has its top. At home, remove the
top from the pineapple, strip off its bottom leaves, leaving 2
1/2-3 inches of solid stem. Allow the top to dry for about three
days.
</P>
<P>
   When the top has dried, plant it in a container full of good
potting soil, pushing the cut end into the medium. Keep the soil
moist, and the top should put out a good root system.
</P>
<P>
   Start with a small pot, and repot as necessary. Since bromeliads
like air movement, grow your pineapple on the patio or deck in
bright light, if possible, during our warm months. Place indoors
during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the plant will flower. From this flower or flowers a
fruit will grow. You'll know it's ready to eat when you notice a
pineapple fragrance. The fruit will give a little when squeezed and
will turn golden.
</P>
<P>
   Carrots can be grown in similar fashion. Cut off the top inch,
place on a plate, cut side down. Add enough water to wet the bottom
of the slice carrot. Place the plate in a sunny window. Water as
needed to keep the bottom wet. Leaves will grow out of the top.
</P>
<P>
   You can do the same with a beet or a turnip in the grocery
garden.

VANCOUVER ATTRACTIONS INCLUDE ONE-OF-A-KIND STEAM CLOCK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ Stretching for several blocks
along the harbor from Canada Place to Maple Tree Square, Gastown
represents the oldest section of downtown Vancouver and is notable
for its late-Victorian architecture and an intriguing variety of
restaurants and shops along cobblestone streets lined with trees
and gas lamps.
</P>
<P>
   Its most riveting attraction is a timepiece unlike any other in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1977 to cover a steam vent on the northwest corner of
Cambie and Water streets, the Gastown Steam Clock stands 16.9 feet
tall, weighs 2 tons and is powered almost entirely by steam.
</P>
<P>
   The top is capped with a Gothic-style roof. Each of the four
sides has a face at the top and clear glass below to show the large
gold-plated pendulum.
</P>
<P>
   Camera-toting passers-by wait for the clock's Westminster chimes
to sound and watch for the accompanying rush of steam.
</P>
<P>
   Gastown, site of a major restoration project in the 1960s, was
named for saloon keeper John ``Gassy Jack'' Deighton. According to
legend, Deighton arrived in the area in 1867 carrying only a bottle
of whiskey. Aware that the nearest saloon was more than 15 miles
away, he told mill workers they could drink free to their hearts'
content if they would help him build a saloon. It was completed
within 24 hours, and Gassy Jack is considered the founding father
of Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   A statue commemorating Gassy Jack overlooks Maple Tree Square.
</P>

NO FREE RIDES? JUST ASK THE AUTHOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The destination of choice may be Britain, Belize, Boston or
Beaumont, the preferred activity museum-hopping, diving, shopping
or biking.
</P>
<P>
   But our diverse travel interests are bound by one common
denominator: We relish a bargain. Whether the vacation budget is
$500 or $5,000, we look for any legitimate means to save a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasize that word ``legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   I am frequently bombarded by literature touting the value of a
lifetime. Then I read the fine print. And I recall the axiom I
repeat often: If an offer sounds too good to be true, it almost
always is.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Cautious interest &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So you can understand my initial skepticism upon encountering
Robert Wm. Kirk's 492-page ``You Can Travel Free,'' an almost
completely rewritten and heavily expanded second edition of his
original treatise authored 13 years ago. Free? In today's travel
environment?
</P>
<P>
   Curiosity _ and an awareness that the publisher, New
Orleans-based Pelican, is known for producing thorough and
high-quality travel guides _ compelled me to scan beyond the cover.
And to discover a reference filled with helpful and intriguing
advice.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk's purpose: to show ``how thousands of seasoned globe
wanderers, bothered by a lack of cash but not by poverty of spirit,
go where they wish, when they wish _ without green stuff,
traveler's checks or credit cards.''
</P>
<P>
   He is quick to concede that ``free,'' as defined in this book,
relates only to money. Those who adopt his strategies, Kirk
cautions, ``must be passionate enough about exploring to spend
something more valuable than money. Free travelers need to give
something of themselves _ time, patience, expertise, interest.''
</P>
<P>
   These types of investments, Kirk reasons, reap rewards beyond
monetary savings: ``Whether you pay something tangible for your
experience, such as the use of your house or apartment while you're
away, or something intangible, such as the pleasure of your company
_ which is all that's asked of some free travelers _ you're bound
to come home with an increased understanding of yourself, of others
and of the places you've visited rather than merely a pocket full
of receipts.''
</P>
<P>
   So where can we go without money?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Jobs on the go &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ever wonder how folks wangle jobs traveling around the world on
cruise ships as enrichment lecturers, gentleman dance hosts,
arts-and-crafts instructors, doctors and nurses or entertainers?
Kirk explains the nitty-gritty. He even provides tips for those
willing to swab the deck and toil in housekeeping as full-time crew
members.
</P>
<P>
   The author does more than scratch the surface. He includes
addresses and phone contacts for major cruise lines and for
agencies that specialize in supplying ships with lecturers,
entertainers and the like. He recommends additional reading
materials for specific interests. This attention to detail is
evident throughout the book; even travelers willing to fork out a
few coins _ or big bucks _ may find the book's contact information
valuable.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kirk, ``The most direct strategy for getting a
great vacation to destinations of your choice with all your basic
expenses paid'' involves recruiting a group to travel with you.
I'll add a caution here: Unqualified group leaders can ruin a trip
for all participants, including themselves. So don't leap lightly
into this means of ``free'' travel.
</P>
<P>
   Other sections concentrate on home exchanges and house- and
boat-sitting; teaching English or other classes overseas; working
vacations; volunteering; traveling on grants, scholarships and
awards; and full-time travel-industry jobs that allow free travel.
</P>
<P>
   Two chapters are devoted to air travel _ one offering a primer
of frequent-flyer programs and another discussing the merits of
traveling as a courier.
</P>
<P>
   A chapter on land transportation covers ride sharing, auto
delivery, biking, hiking and backpacking.
</P>
<P>
   Creativity often is the key to free travel, Kirk suggests:
``Some creative travelers find unusual conveyances to transport
them from place to place or they travel in conventional vehicles
and publicize something about themselves that's unusual.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a few years back six young fellows wanted to
bicycle from San Diego to Washington, D.C. Bicycling is
conventional. What attracted the interest of the public was that
the youngest fellow was 62, the oldest 75. Because of the
publicity, these enterprising retirees were able to talk a hotel
chain into giving them free rooms everywhere they scheduled stops
for a night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other innovative adventurers go from one place to another in
bizarre manners to raise money for charity and to finance their
trip at the same time. They skate across several countries, sail up
a coast in a bathtub, paddle a surfboard from port to port or soar
in a glider. Donors pledge money for each mile the fund-raiser
completes. All funds collected after expenses go to help a needy
cause.''
</P>
<P>
   More traditional travelers aren't ignored, either. Kirk details
scores of attractions _ museums, recreational areas, festivals,
churches, galleries _ open to the public at no charge in the United
States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Area bookstores stock or can order ``You Can Travel Free,''
which costs $15.95 _ in green stuff, travelers' checks or credit
cards.
</P>

WATER SHUTTLES ARE AMONG THE EXOTIC TRANSIT OPTIONS AVAILABLE IN
SAN ANTONIO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ ``Taxi, please!''
</P>
<P>
   Those are words familiar to any experienced traveler. But in the
Alamo City, your request may elicit follow-up questions:
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to travel by land or water? By car, boat, trolley
or bicycle?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for those who prefer to park the family car in a garage
and let others handle transportation, San Antonio is a dream
destination. Few cities offer so many diverse ways to see the
sites. Or merely to progrss from point to point.
</P>
<P>
   Among options:
</P>
<P>
   Yanaguana Cruises' Rio Trans, a water shuttle launched earlier
this year, provides frequent connecting service to nine locations
along the River Walk.
</P>
<P>
   Rio Trans utilizes the same type boats used for popular guided
tours along the San Antonio River. But there is no narration. And
these vessels, clearly identified by a Rio Trans sign mounted on
the front, are seldom jam-packed.
</P>
<P>
   The river taxis depart about every 20 minutes from each
designated stop. Most stops are situated at or near major hotels.
One-way tickets cost $3.50 each and are valid between any two
destinations along the route, no matter the distance. An all-day
pass costs $10, a three-day pass $25.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets must be purchased in advance at any of about 20
locations, including many hotels along the River Walk. No cash is
accepted aboard the boats. The shuttle operates from 10 a.m.-9 p.m.
Sundays-Thursdays and 10 a.m.-10 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Yanaguana, which assumed operation of the river boats in 1995,
continues to offer narrated tours daily beginning at 9 a.m. Costs
are $5.25 for adults ($3.65 for seniors and active military
personnel) and $1 for children 5 and under. Ticket booths for these
tours are at the Rivercenter Mall and Holiday Inn River Walk and
across the river from the Hilton Palacio del Rio. Dining charters
and other specialty tours can be arranged. Call 800-417-4139 for
information.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIA Streetcar offers daily service on five routes. Riders can
access almost all major attractions on historic streetcars that
arrive every 10 minutes at each stop. Cost is 50 cents each way;
tokens and monthly passes (for $5) are available. Call 210-362-2020
for information.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alamo Pedicabs, which can accommodate two adults and a child as
passengers, transport visitors through the downtown area 5:30-11
p.m. Mondays-Fridays and 11 a.m.-11 p.m. on weekends, weather
permitting. The taxibikes pick up at no charge, with gratuities the
only compensation for drivers. Call 210-710-3865.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several companies offer traditional automobile taxi service
available around the clock. Inquire at hotels or restaurants or
consult a telephone information service.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star Trolley Tours and Gray Line of San Antonio (both
accessible at 800-472-9546 or 210-222-9090), and Texas Trolley
Tours &AMP; Charters and San Antonio City Tours (800-868-7707 or
210-212-5395), are among companies specializing in sight-seeing
excursions of varying length. Some tours focus on the city's five
historic Spanish missions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Horse-and-carriage tours also are available, weather permitting.
Carriages are usually stationed near Alamo Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Currently under way is a three-year Mission Trails project that
will provide a 12-mile network of streets, bicycle lanes and
hike-and-bike trails connecting San Antonio missions.
</P>
<P>
   A good source for brochures and information on San Antonio
attractions _ and the ways to explore them _ is the city's
Convention and Visitors Bureau. Call 800-447-3372. &QL;

INTEL CHAIRMAN TO HELP RAISE MONEY FOR REFUGEE ORGANIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Intel Corp. Chairman Andy Grove will help
raise money this week for the International Rescue Committee as a
way of showing gratitude for helping him get to America.
</P>
<P>
   Grove, a longtime financial benefactor of the IRC, will take to
the stage Thursday at a fund-raiser for the organization to recount
his refugee days and promote the IRC's mission of helping refugees
from around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an expression of gratitude,'' said Grove, who heads the
behemoth microchip maker that manufactures the vast majority of the
digital brains for the world's computers. ``One I make gladly for
myself and for others like me who were helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Grove's IRC saga began in November 1956 when, as a 20-year-old
chemistry student, he had just completed a harrowing 12-mile
cross-country escape from his native Hungary. His homeland was
being overrun by columns of Soviet tanks, the aftermath of the
brutal crushing a student-led uprising against the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were minefields and stuff like that,'' Grove said
matter-of-factly, recalling his cross-border journey.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second regime Grove had eluded: During World War II,
Grove and his mother lived under forged identities to evade the
Nazis and his father, George, a Hungarian dairyman, had been
snatched away in the middle of the night to spend much of the war
on a cruel work brigade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a lucky one,'' Grove recalled. ``He eventually returned
to us, but he was in terrible shape. He had lost almost half his
weight _ typhoid fever and such.''
</P>
<P>
   Grove, then going by his birth name of Andras Grof, joined a
legion of Middle European refugees fleeing the communist state.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to picture the scene there,'' Grove said, shifting
his slim frame in a chair at Intel's Santa Clara headquarters. ``At
any given time, there were about 100,000 Hungarians, mostly my age,
milling around, looking for food, looking for places to stay,''
Grove said. ``We overran Vienna almost overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   As a refugee in Austria, he heard about the IRC. The brain child
of Albert Einstein, the IRC was then a group of U.S. artists and
intellectuals who helped rescue their European colleagues
endangered by the rise of Hitler's fascism.
</P>
<P>
   In Austria, Grove was interviewed at his hostel by IRC
volunteers, mostly U.S. students studying overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know why,'' Grove said, ``but I was accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at a boat that would take him to America, Grove was
handed a tag, a small, stiff piece of paper dangling from a string.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told to attach it to the button on my overcoat,'' Grove
said. ``And that's all there was. No passport. No other papers.
Just that tag.''
</P>
<P>
   Grove and hundreds of his fellow refugees were then loaded onto
an aging Liberty troop transport ship for a gut-wrenching, 15-day
journey across a stormy winter Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``These ships were designed to carry troops in high density. You
ate standing up. Almost everyone was sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Grove said, his face crinkling into a grin, ``it got us
over here.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the young refugee was assigned to an IRC caseworker
named Irma Kadmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a number of Hungarian students that I was working
with,'' recalls Kadmon, 90, who now lives in Forrest Hills, N.Y.,
``but he stood out. There was just something about him.''
</P>
<P>
   There then followed what Grove remembers as surrealistic acts of
kindness.
</P>
<P>
   The IRC immediately sent Grove to the dentist after his arrival
in the United States. ``I thought, `Why are they doing this? It
must be a fraud or something,''' Grove remembered. ``It was the
first time in my life that I had had my teeth cleaned.''
</P>
<P>
   His teeth were not his only concern. A childhood bout with
scarlet fever had left Grove with a 50 percent hearing loss. Kadmon
told Grove to find a suitable hearing aid, and the IRC would foot
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up trying out everything,'' Grove recalls. ``I chose
one that was, by far, the most expensive, around $500-$600. That
was back in 1957.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It had the best sound, but it was so expensive,'' said Grove,
who has since had reconstructive surgery to restore his hearing.
``I was very hesitant to tell my caseworker, but they just picked
up the bill. They didn't say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Grove's admission into City College of New York
in 1957. ``I just walked in off the street,'' Grove said. ``I had
no papers, no nothing. I spoke broken English.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man sat me down and worked with me to figure out what I
needed. On the basis of just what I said, I got admitted.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Grove graduated at the head of his engineering class.
After completing his doctorate at the University of California at
Berkeley, Grove took a job with Fairchild Semiconductor in Santa
Clara County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember driving out West,'' Grove said. ``I saw this sign
that said I was reaching the Sierra Nevada mountains. I had read
about the Sierra in cowboy books, and then there it was. It really
hit home with me that I was truly in America.''
</P>
<P>
   At Fairchild, Grove worked on using purified silicon as a
platform for microscopic transistors _ devices that would become
known as microprocessing chips. In 1968, he joined colleagues
Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce at Integrated Electronics, a start-up
computer processor company that quickly shortened its name to
Intel, the label now imprinted on 80 percent of all microprocessors
working in computers today.
</P>
<P>
   ``A long journey with many steps,'' Grove said, sitting inside
the modern headquarters of what is now a multinational,
multibillion-dollar Silicon Valley giant.
</P>
<P>
   But it's those first steps and the kindness of strangers that
stand out for Grove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came from a background where nobody treated anyone well.
Particularly if you wanted something. This agency that gave me
stuff in such a warm, straightforward fashion,'' he said, his eyes
growing moist. ``I never felt inferior or at their mercy.''

ANDY CAPP'S GONE TO THOSE GREAT FUNNY PAGES IN THE SKY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL HARRAL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are some things you can mess with and some things you mess
with at your peril.
</P>
<P>
   As a working journalist almost all my adult life, I'd like to
believe that people buy and read the newspaper because of their
deep desire to know and understand the ways of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But sitting in the ombudsman's chair for 10 months now has
forced me to face a reality that I once would have disputed: Some
of you read things in the newspaper other than news.
</P>
<P>
   Like comics.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Capp, to be specific.
</P>
<P>
   Andy disappeared from the comics pages of the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram last week and the reaction was instantaneous.
</P>
<P>
   Several callers mentioned being subscribers for a long time _ 29
years in one instance _ and allowed as how they might have to sever
that long-term connection if we failed to bring Andy Capp back.
</P>
<P>
   We can't.
</P>
<P>
   Cartoonist Reg Smythe, who created the strip, died June 13 at
the age of 81. Britain's Press Association reported the death and
noted that Mr. Smythe once said he modeled the Capp character on
his father, and Capp's long-suffering wife, Flo, on his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   One reader said that he liked Andy Capp because he reminded him
of himself: Lay around all day and drink beer. I happen to know
that for this guy, that's not true. But the concept is intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who did not like Andy Capp were various feminists.
They didn't like the way Andy, an unrepentant male chauvinist,
pub-crawling soccer hooligan, treated his wife.
</P>
<P>
   (Every writer needs an editor and mine on the Sunday column is
columnist Bill Thompson. His not entirely tongue-in-cheek comment
about the mini-flap: ``You mean they liked that sexist comic strip
that glorified alcoholism?'')
</P>
<P>
   Andy ranked near the bottom along with Gasoline Alley and Snuffy
Smith in a highly unscientific survey of readers' favorite comics
conducted by my predecessor, Phil Record, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Andy Capp is one in a long line of cartoon characters
that have graced the pages of newspapers, not, as you might think,
for the entertainment of readers but as a circulation-building and
retention device.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh A. Mulligan of The Associated Press detailed the connection
between comics and newspapers in a 1993 article that we published
in the Sunday early edition _ the ``bulldog'' in newspaper slang.
</P>
<P>
   Since many stories published in that edition never see print in
the regular Sunday paper, the odds are that you didn't read it
unless you are one of the shopping fanatics for whom that issue is
designed.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than a century ago when newspaper readers ``fell in
love with a jug-eared, barefoot, gap-toothed urchin who spoke
street-smart wisdom in dialogue printed on his flour-sack
nightshirt,'' Mulligan's article said.
</P>
<P>
   That was during the turn-of-the-century newspaper wars among
press barons like William Randolph Hearst, Joseph Pulitzer, James
Gordon Bennett and Joseph Medill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pulitzer turned to artist Richard Felton Outcault to attract
new readers to his New York World via cartoon comedy,'' Mulligan
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On May 5, 1895, with the urbanization of America already under
way, Outcault unveiled in black and white a picaresque set of slum
characters dwelling in the tenements of Hogan's Alley. That's when
the nameless street urchin appeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid made journalism history a few months later when
composing room boss Charles Saalburgh decided that the kid's
nightie, rather than the fashion page, was made to order to test
the World's new four-color rotogravure presses. Yellow was the
color chosen, and the Yellow Kid became so instantly popular that
Hearst promptly waved his checkbook and appropriated Outcault for
his New York Morning Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pulitzer bought him back and, when outbid again by Hearst,
hired George Luks, later associated with the historic Ashcan School
of Art, to draw a rival Yellow Kid,'' the article said. ``Thus the
term `yellow journalism' entered the language, the first of many to
come from this new cultural medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Words and phrases that entered the language as a result included
jeep; goon; drugstore cowboy; yes, we have no bananas; heebie
jeebies; horsefeathers; and red hot mamma, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, I don't think we handled the demise of Andy Capp
very well.
</P>
<P>
   Once we began getting calls and letters, we printed a notice at
the bottom of Highlights column on Page 1. But none of my later
callers saw it.
</P>
<P>
   I think the proper place for the notice was on the comics page
in the old Andy Capp position.
</P>
<P>
   Most people read the same comic strips in the same order every
day _ I know I do _ and we could have instantly communicated with
every Andy Capp fan in our circulation area.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't and we heard about it.
</P>
<P>
   See, there are some things you can't mess with without paying a
price.
</P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A sampling of one-liners and true facts
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are some bits of wisdom and one-liners that I've culled
from e-mail messages sent to me over the past few weeks by friends
with too much time on their hands. Enjoy:
</P>
<P>
   _ Never raise your hands to your kids. It leaves your groin
unprotected. (Red Buttons)
</P>
<P>
   _ Did you ever notice when you blow in a dog's face he gets mad
at you? But when you take him in a car he sticks his head out the
window. (Steve Bluestone)
</P>
<P>
   _ Have you ever noticed? Anybody going slower than you is an
idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac. (George
Carlin)
</P>
<P>
   _ I'm not into working out. My philosophy: No pain, no pain.
(Carol Leifer)
</P>
<P>
   _ The reason most people play golf is to wear clothes they would
not be caught dead in otherwise. (Roger Simon)
</P>
<P>
   _ I'm desperately trying to figure out why kamikaze pilots wore
helmets. (Dave Edison)
</P>
<P>
   _ I voted for the Democrats because I didn't like the way the
Republicans were running the country. Which is turning out to be
like shooting yourself in the head to stop your headache. (Jack
Mayberry)
</P>
<P>
   _ I had a linguistics professor who said that it's man's ability
to use language that makes him the dominant species on the planet.
That may be. But I think there's one other thing that separates us
from animals. We aren't afraid of vacuum cleaners. (Jeff Stilson)
</P>
<P>
   _ The statistics on sanity are that one out of every four
Americans is suffering from some form of mental illness. Think of
your three best friends. If they are OK, then it's you. (Rita Mae
Brown)
</P>
<P>
   _ I always wanted to be somebody, but I should have been more
specific. (Lily Tomlin)
</P>
<P>
   _ Why does Sea World have a seafood restaurant? I'm halfway
through my fishburger and I realize, Oh my God....I could be eating
a slow learner. (Lynda Montgomery)
</P>
<P>
   True facts about movies and television shows:
</P>
<P>
   _ During any police investigation, it will be necessary to visit
a strip club at least once.
</P>
<P>
   _ All telephone numbers in America begin with the digits 555.
</P>
<P>
   _ All beds have special L-shaped sheets that reach up to the
armpit level on a woman but only to waist level on the man lying
beside her.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ventilation system of any building is the perfect hiding
place. No one will ever think of looking for you in there, and you
can travel to any other part of the building you want without
difficulty.
</P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: What is politics' next destructive trend?
 &HT;    (For release Oct. 28, 1998)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Go back just five years, to 1993. Everyone, it seems, either was
being rejected or removing themselves from consideration for high
government positions because they weren't paying Social Security
taxes for their immigrant household workers, or because their
workers were undocumented.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's first two nominees for attorney general _ Zoe
Baird and Kimba Wood _ dropped out when it was revealed they
employed undocumented immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, along came Janet Reno, who said she did her own
housecleaning; that seemingly was good enough to become attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in 1993, Clinton lost another nominee, partly due to the
revelation that he failed to pay a part-time housekeeper's Social
Security taxes and partly because columnist Bill Safire was firing
written broadsides against his nomination. Secretary of Defense
nominee Bobby Inman decided he didn't want to fight it all and
dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and two dozen other
high-level Clinton appointees managed to keep their jobs despite
past Social Security violations involving domestic workers, which
prompted feminist activists to ask aloud why it was that men could
get away with it and women couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was being swept with bucket-and-broom notoriety. For
some, there was a rush to reveal before being exposed. Sen. Bob
Graham (D-Fla.), for one, announced before a potential opponent
could expose it that he had paid the Internal Revenue Service $300
in back taxes for a housecleaner at his Miami area home _ and wiped
the sweat from his brow.
</P>
<P>
   Now, five years later, the active term is sex rather than
Windex.
</P>
<P>
   No longer is it whom you employed; it's whom you bedded.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Monica Lewinsky's relationship with Bill Clinton was
revealed, either moles have uncloaked other conjugal misadventures,
or the participants themselves have stepped forward in an attempt
to diminish the sting of exposure by others.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.), knowing the dogs were closing in, beat
them to the punch by revealing a child he fathered out of wedlock.
Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), who chairs the House Judiciary Committee
hearings that will judge Clinton, admitted to an affair he had just
before it was about to be exposed on the Internet. Rep. Helen
Chenoweth (R-Idaho), who got to Washington on the demerits of her
Democratic incumbent opponent's exposed affair, it turns out, had a
six-year dalliance with a married man.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the nation, there is a sudden rush of sniffing around
the sex lives of politicians and bureaucrats, not entirely
dissimilar to the earlier scouting of who was washing whose floors
with or without green cards or tax payments.
</P>
<P>
   One only can imagine what can come next; nothing is beyond reach
these days.
</P>
<P>
   In Tennessee last week, the opponent of an incumbent state
senator was charged with his murder. Enough said.

<P>
   SCI-SHUTTLE (Cape Canaveral, Fla.) _ Crews arrive, other final
preparations for the John Glenn space launch. By John Noble
Wilford. (400 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MOOSE-REBOUND (Greenville, Maine) _ Usually, no one has to
sneak up on a moose. At the turn of this century, moose had been
all but wiped out. Now hunting is tightly controlled and many farms
have reverted to forest. Natural predators like wolves have been
eliminated from much of the north woods. And logging has converted
great stretches of the woods to young forests, where tender leaves
and twigs are at just the right height for a moose. The result has
been a population explosion among moose. And they've been spotted
as far south as New Haven, Conn. By William K. Stevens. (1970
words)
</P>

</P>
<P>
   SCI-MOOSE-SUIT (Undated) _ Dr. Joel Berger and his wife, Carol
Cunningham, wanted to find out if the near-extinction of big
predators like wolves and grizzly bears in the contiguous 48 states
had wrought any changes in moose behavior. One way, they figured,
was to drop predator scents in the form of wolf urine and bear
scats near the moose and observe their reactions. So the two
scientists asked a designer who had worked on the Star Wars movies
to make a moose suit and observed various moose reactions. By
William K. Stevens. (550 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ARCHIMEDES-BOOK (Undated) _ A millennium-old volume, defaced
by mildew and scorched around the edges, will go on the auction
block Thursday, and scholars hope that expert examination of the
relic will reveal nuances in the thinking of Archimedes _ the
greatest mathematical genius of the ancient world. The volume, a
10th-century copy of writings by Archimedes (who died in 212 B.C.
at the hands of a Roman soldier), is the oldest and presumably most
authentic copy of Archimedes' major works to survive the centuries.
By Malcolm Browne. (1735 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ADDICTION (Undated) _ It is much easier to get off an
addictive drug than to stay off it, largely because prolonged drug
use changes the brain in fundamental and lasting ways, new research
shows. As scientists learn more about the long-term effects,
treatment possibilities expand. In some cases, research has shown,
those brain changes even include alterations in the functioning of
genes. By Denise Grady. (1400 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ELDERLY-ASTRONAUTS (Undated) _ Some 160 people ages 55 to 84
from around the country have gone through a Kansas astronaut camp,
run by Elderhostel, which provides educational adventures worldwide
for adults ages 55 and over. By Warren E. Leary. (985 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SOUND-OCEANS (Undated) _ A $40-million research program has
proved that sound can be used to measure the temperature of the
world's oceans and detect long-term climate change, scientists say.
But the project has spent so much money meeting demands by
environmental groups that its leaders expect to have to end the
program a year from now. By Malcolm Browne. (1300 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ Shorts on science: Carrying an infant
around all day can be hard work, as any new parent can attest. But
not for a wallaby, says new research. Other items: disk of debris
around star known as 55 Cancri and environmental damage from
collapse of Spanish retaining wall. (450 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WOMEN-WANDERERS (Undated) _ An Essay: In droll contrast to
the archetype of the wandering male, the restive Attila the Huns
and Jack Kerouacs of the world, scientists have found that, from a
chromosomal perspective, men are really a sedentary lot.
Researchers from Harvard and Stanford say that a comparison of
strictly male versus strictly female genetic lineages demonstrates
that the rate of intercontinental migrations of women has been
about eight times that of men. For at least the past few thousand
years, women, not men, have been the ones to leave their homes for
foreign lands and have kept the human gene pool well blended. By
Natalie Angier. (955 words)
</P>
<P>
   And
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WOMEN-INDIA (Undated) _ Genetic analysis shows that women in
India have more social mobility than men. By Nicholas Wade. (500

   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Science questions answered. (300 words)

<P>
   &UR; Health &AMP; Fitness &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEALTH-PACEMAKERS (Undated) _ Arne H.W. Larsson's last
billion heart beats have made him a medical marvel, a pioneer in
one of the great triumphs of cardiology and electronic engineering.
Forty years ago this month, Larsson, now 83, became the world's
first recipient of an implanted cardiac pacemaker, the battery
powered devices that electrically stimulate and regulate dangerous
heart rhythms. In that time, has have had 25 pacemakers, which have
become smaller, smarter, safer, more durable and versatile. By
Lawrence K. Altman. (1700 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo and graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: For
most amateurs on the playing fields, walking and running paths,
cycling trails, tennis courts and ski slopes and in swimming pools
and weight rooms, overuse injuries are often the consequence of
poor technique or misalignment of body parts. Those can often be
avoided by learning how to perform the activities the right way
from the beginning and by having technique monitored periodically
by an expert. By Jane E. Brody. (1250 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ELDERLY-CONTENT (Undated) _ Aging brings predictable
travails: The body starts to crumble, memory decays, old friends
begin to fall ill and die. But a new study indicates the passage of
years may also bestow a heightened sense of well-being, at least
for the generation of Americans now well into their retirement
years. (540 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-ALTITUDE (Undated) _ Contrary to the belief
ingrained in endurance athletes for nearly 30 years that exercising
in thin mountain air is the best way to improve performance at sea
level, a team of doctors has found that athletes benefit most from
living a more sedentary life at high altitude while doing the bulk
of their training at a low altitude. Called `living high and
training low,' the program is gaining acceptance among some
athletes. (1800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-FLEXIBILITY (Undated) _ Though for decades experts
have been reminding everyone to stretch in order to improve and
maintain flexibility, for the first time, the American College of
Sports Medicine has issued guidelines for flexibility training. In
its new position stand recently published in the journal Medicine &AMP;
Science in Sports &AMP; Exercise, the ACSM recommends incorporating
stretching exercises into an overall fitness plan by performing 3
to 4 stretches for each oft used muscle group _ including the
thighs, lower back, and chest _ and holding each stretching
position for 10-30 seconds. (850 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEALTH-PRO&AMP;CON (Undated) _ Should pig cells be transplanted
to humans?
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Shorts on science, including these:
</P>
<P>
   _To the list of factors that affect one's fate, add footwear.
Japanese and American men walk and run differently because they
grow up wearing different kinds of shoes, research from Western
Michigan University suggests. (200 words)
</P>
<P>
   _Now, British doctors are reporting that male and female fetuses
sometimes really do affect their mothers differently. Women with
asthma who are carrying girls, for example, are more likely to find
that the disease worsens than those who are pregnant with boys.
(200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-INFANT-MURDERS (Undated) _ The number of infant homicides
has increased to the point that a baby is murdered practically
every day in the United States, according to the largest study on
the subject. Though many important details, such as who commits
these crimes and why, are sketchy, the study suggests how to
protect babies at high risk. (574 words)

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lord, this is such a hick town sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the Giants, building a pretty new ballpark for our
entertainment, and all they want to do is stick an elegant 80-foot
Coke bottle behind the left-field fence that will blow its cap and
shoot faux foam every time a Giant hits a home run.
</P>
<P>
   And what do the Giants get for their trouble? Miscellaneous
``foes'' claiming the bottle is unsightly, annoying, sends kids the
wrong message and causes ferries to collide in the middle of the
bay and kill thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Now does this seem fair to you? Of course not.
</P>
<P>
   As we know, the owners have always been in the baseball racket
for the purest of motives _ trying to make a buck. That is why they
are building a new stadium, so that more people will pay more money
to watch their little ballclub. Plus, they are building the stadium
with their own banks' money, so they long ago established a
precedent for hiking up their skirts for anyone with an ad campaign
and the dough to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong? Not really. It's commerce in the '90s, and what is
supposed to pass as cool in Indianapolis or Birmingham will surely
pass as cool in San Francisco, because somewhere in Peter Magowan's
desk drawer is a demographic survey that says so.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the ``real'' in real estate also stands for real
expensive, so whatever can be sold, already has been.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the exploding Coke bottle. Yes it's ghastly,
the kind of hideous idea we laugh at when we see it in other towns.
It is precisely the sort of great civic embarrassment we have come
to expect from smaller and more insecure places.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Coke bottle in its mutant glory is actually a great
benefit to us all, because it will serve as a shining example of
what comes to those who believe the campaign vision and ignore the
laws of gravity and the fine print.
</P>
<P>
   The facts:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Giants have painted themselves as worshipers of the
simpler times of decades past, and the ballpark was going to give
us all that retro feel we have ached for since the end of our 11th
birthday party. In fact, they are promising us nothing with the new
ballpark except better and more efficient revenue streams for
themselves. We have yet to see whether they will turn all this
extra revenue into more resources for the baseball team, but we are
not losing anything but our misconceptions about the purity of
their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   _ All the other new ballparks have bright and hideous
advertising of their own. Ever been to the ballpark in Arlington?
Or Coors Field? Or Turner Field? Or Edison Field? They all have
that old-timey feel, plus ads bright enough to melt an elephant's
cornea. The Coke bottle only advances an already well-established
trend.
</P>
<P>
   _ Here in San Francisco, we like to think of ourselves as the
world's most sophisticated city, wry, clever, engaged, detached,
intellectual, sardonic and oh so very cool, all at the same time.
But the last time we checked, Jerry Springer gets good ratings
here, too.
</P>
<P>
   So is the Coke bottle crass, cheap and silly? Is it beneath our
pretenses of dignity? Could the Giants have been more involved in
quality control? You betcha.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants didn't do it for you anyway. They did it for
themselves, and they know you'll come anyway. You'll rave about the
new stadium, you'll call it the architectural superior of Oriole
Park at Camden Yards, Jacobs Field or even Fenway Park. You'll love
the joint, and when you think nobody's looking, you'll sneak a peek
at the bottle the first time Rich Aurilia busts a Mike Remlinger
curve ball.
</P>
<P>
   And you know what else? Eventually, you'll get used to the
damned thing to the point where you don't even notice it, the way
you no longer notice the foghorn that blows at Candlestick Park, or
the cable car bells, or Sherry Davis' voice. It all blends into the
obnoxious din that passes for background noise at most baseball
games.

IN DEFENSE OF VANGUARD INDEX VALUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNTEH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. You have long advocated Vanguard Index Value fund over
Vanguard Index 500. What's happened? When the market was climbing,
it rose less than Index 500, and during the decline it has dropped
more. Clearly Index 500 is the better investment. Thoughts?
</P>
<P>
   S.M., Westborough, Mass. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Although the fund's 1998 results have certainly been a
disappointment, I still prefer Vanguard Index Value to Index 500,
and prefer it even more when it is compared with its sibling,
Vanguard Index Growth. This is because the portfolio of Index Value
_ the stolid members of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index with the
lowest price-to-book value ratios, are those that I consider best
in the event of a prolonged sour market.
</P>
<P>
   It's easier to compare Index Value to Index Growth, since the
two funds represent complementary portfolios drawn from the
portfolio of Index 500. The Growth portfolio holds the ``hot''
stocks of the market, currently heavily focused on sectors such as
technology and health care. But it pays big prices to buy these
stocks. Index Growth had a portfolio price-to-earnings ratio of
37.0 at the time of the last Morningstar Mutual Funds report on the
funds, which compares to 22.6 for Index Value; the figure for Index
500 was 30.6. The difference is even greater when you look at the
price-to-book value ratios, which is the measure by which the two
portfolios are segregated.
</P>
<P>
   Index Growth has a price-to-book ratio of 7.7, compared with 7.3
for Index 500, and 3.3 for Index Value.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the third factor that will buttress a stock in a weak
market is the dividend yield.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar lists the yield for Index Value at 1.8 percent,
compared with 1.4 percent for Index 500 and 0.9 percent for Index
Growth. And looking behind those statistics, I like the quality of
the dividends that are in the Index Value portfolio _ utilities,
energy stocks, and financials seem to me more likely to maintain or
even boost dividends in a downturn than the high-fliers whose
dividends are frequently only token.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, of course, addresses the relative performance of
the funds in the choppy markets of 1998. There's no question that
even in a tough year, the growth stocks have fared better than
value issues. From my point of view, this represents the last
throes of a bull market _ the high-tech and drug stocks that are
most closely watched by the market have been the issues that have
recovered from the numerous market spills, while the unspectacular
issues that make up the value portfolio have had a harder time
recovering.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, in general I'm not wild about the large-cap market
sector in which all three of these funds operate; whichever
portfolio you look at, the stocks are overvalued. But from my point
of view, the Value portfolio is just overvalued, while the Index
500 portfolio is quite over-valued, and the Growth portfolio is
very overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   I've liked Index Value since its inception, and have often been
an investor in the fund, although I'm not right now. Given that
most of the markets since November 1992 (when the Value and Growth
funds were launched) have been dominated by large-cap growth
stocks, I think the relative performance of Index Value has been
quite creditable: According to Vanguard, average annual total
returns from Nov. 1, 1992 have been 17.30 percent for Index Value,
compared with 19.42 percent for Index Growth.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I do not view Index Value as the fund for
everybody. Certainly for a person building a portfolio for a
retirement that's 20 years or so away, Index 500 would certainly be
the better choice. But for investors with a conservative bent, and
investors who are closer to my own age (in my mid-50s), Index Value
appeals strongly.
</P>
<P>
   So in the end, my answer to your question about the relative
performance of these index funds is this: Index Value has delivered
a solid performance during its short period of operation, even
though it has yet to see a market in which it should really
demonstrate its virtues.
</P>
<P>
   By this, I mean a sustained bear market, in which investors
begin to look at the old-fashioned virtues that buoy a stock when
everything goes sour _ the power to deliver a sustained earnings
stream, a modest market price relative to book value, and dividend
checks that are not only generous and unlikely to be interrupted,
but even with the potential to advance modestly in seasons when the
chips are down.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 55 and have a solid 17-year career with a good company,
which offers both a pension and a 401(k) fund managed by American
Express. I have roughly half my accumulation in a money market fund
and the rest, plus all ongoing contributions, in a stock index
fund. I contribute 10 percent of my income, and the company matches
50 percent of the first 6 percent of my contributions. Am I doing
the right thing, or should I be spread out differently? I plan to
work until age 65, and in addition to the pension plan, Social
Security, and the 401(k), I will have a Navy retirement income of
roughly $1,300 a month.
</P>
<P>
   J.B., Mansfield, Mass. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think you would profit by making two moves.
</P>
<P>
   First, with a decade to go until retirement, you can easily
afford the risks inherent in replacing the money market fund with
the second most conservative offering on the 401(k) menu _ PIMCo
Total Return fund, which holds an intermediate-duration bond
portfolio dominated by government-guaranteed and AAA issues. Over a
decade, it has produced average annual returns of 10.39 percent,
and during those 10 years it dipped into the red only in 1994, when
it lost 3.58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Second, by putting all of your stock market exposure in the
stock index fund, you are relying entirely on a market sector that
seems to me to be getting pretty tired _ the large-cap stocks that
have dominated the markets for the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest that you cut your position in the index fund to about
30 percent, dividing the other 20 percent evenly among three funds
in other market sectors.
</P>
<P>
   First is AIM Constellation fund, which built an excellent
long-term record with a portfolio of mid-cap growth stocks,
dominated by health, technology, and retail issues. This year,
perhaps as a function of its growing size, or perhaps reflecting a
sentiment about the markets with which I agree, the fund's
portfolio has moved to a blend of growth and value issues in the
mid-cap sector.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Neuberger and Berman Genesis fund has a respectable
record in the small-cap value sector, putting its heaviest
concentrations in utilities and industrial stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Janus Worldwide fund, which holds 80 percent of its
portfolio in non-US stocks, would give you a modest exposure to
other stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there's no question that the effect of all these
suggestions would be to increase risk, but the majority of the
additional risk comes not from diversifying the stock portfolio,
but from moving from the money market fund into the
intermediate-term bond offering. I think the potential rewards here
justify the additional risk.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to the stock side, with smaller-cap and
overseas stocks added to the portfolio, when the additional
diversification is combined with what I consider the likely
exhaustion of the domestic large-cap market, it seems to me that
alignment is more conservative than just sticking with the
large-cap stock index.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have contributed the maximum $2,000 to 1998 Roth IRAs for
myself and my wife, and we will also contribute the maximum amounts
in 1999. What would be the best way to invest now for 1999 IRAs? Is
there any way to start a '99 IRA in 1998?
</P>
<P>
   T.H., Fort Worth &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Sorry, but you can't make a deposit in any IRA account before
Jan. 1 of the tax year for which the contribution will count. It's
only for those who are late that the regulations allow some leeway;
a person may contribute to an IRA at any date up to April 15 of the
year following the tax year of the con-tribution. So if you have
$4,000 of potential IRA money burning a hole in your pocket, you're
best off parking it in a money market fund until Jan. 1.

BUSH'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS? TOO NUMEROUS TO LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush was in Fort Worth the other day,
visiting with volunteers at his local campaign headquarters and
reminding loyalists that the election isn't over until the votes
are counted.
</P>
<P>
   All those public-opinion polls that show him running away with
the Nov. 3 election, Bush said, are encouraging and gratifying _
but the only poll that counts is the one taken Election Day in
voting booths across the state.
</P>
<P>
   So the governor wants everyone who believes that he deserves
re-election to get out and vote. Bush didn't say what you should do
if you plan to vote for somebody else, but I'm guessing that he
wants you to vote anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Citizen participation is the tonic that energizes democracy.
Apathy is poison.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, even if Bush doesn't need the vote of every Texan, he
deserves it.
</P>
<P>
   He has earned it.
</P>
<P>
   I stated recently that Bush turned virtually every plank of his
1994 platform into law. The next day, a reader called and demanded
specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just what exactly has he done?'' the reader wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   OK. Let's start with welfare reform. Bush promised during his
first campaign for governor to change the state's welfare system in
a way that would end dependency on government and encourage
personal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Legislature enacted _ and Bush signed _ a welfare
reform bill that requires all welfare recipients to work or to be
trained for work as a condition for receiving temporary cash
assistance. The new program drastically reduced the state's welfare
rolls.
</P>
<P>
   The welfare changes implemented by the Bush administration also
reduced welfare fraud and gave local communities responsibility for
helping welfare recipients move from welfare to work.
</P>
<P>
   There's more. Lots more.
</P>
<P>
   Candidate Bush promised tort reform in 1994. Gov. Bush delivered
it in 1995. Major changes in the civil justice system reduced the
number and cost of lawsuits, resulting in lower insurance premiums
for Texas residents.
</P>
<P>
   Tort reform and other economic development programs contributed
to the creation of 869,000 Texas jobs during the first three years
of Bush's governorship. The state's unemployment rate has gone down
every year since Bush became governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush promised major changes in public education during his '94
campaign and he delivered them in '95 as the Legislature passed a
new education code that emphasizes local control of schools and
holds school districts accountable for student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's leadership led to an increase of the state's share of
education funding, from 44 percent to 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's leadership produced a $1 billion reduction in property
taxes _ the biggest tax cut in Texas history.
</P>
<P>
   Candidate Bush promised a complete overhaul of the state's
juvenile justice system in 1994. Gov. Bush signed the changes into
law in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   These are merely highlights, you understand. The details and
far-reaching ramifications of the changes I've outlined here could
provide material for dozens of columns _ which is why I don't go
through the entire list of Bush's accomplishments every time I set
out to make the point that he is a can-do governor.
</P>
<P>
   He can do even more. Bush has second-term plans for additional
changes in welfare and education, for tax relief, for continued
economic development.
</P>
<P>
   If I don't always list all of Bush's achievements when I'm
touting him for re-election, it's not because there's a shortage of
specifics; it's because there are simply too many achievements to
include in one little ol' newspaper column.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Democratic opponent has been trying to convince the
people of Texas that Bush hasn't done anything as governor. The
opponent knows better _ and so do the people of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Texans are well aware of what Bush has done as governor and they
will surely reward him with a landslide victory one week from
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is not asking for a landslide. He is asking Texas
voters to go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The landslide will take care of itself.

`SNL' PRETENDERS PROVE MOST SKETCH COMEDIES STILL HAVE FEET OF
CLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's always struck me about the periodic bashing of ``Saturday
Night Live'' is how many others have died trying to duplicate it.
If ``SNL'' has really been sloshing about in mediocrity the past
decade _ as some of you have passionately claimed _ what exactly
does its longevity say about the state of sketch comedy?
</P>
<P>
   I can remember back in 1995 when Fox unleashed ``Mad TV,'' and
Time magazine gushed that the brash upstart had ``an edginess that
(''SNL'') has long lacked _ it's Spin to `SNL's' Rolling Stone.''
</P>
<P>
   A confession: I stopped watching ``Mad TV'' about midway through
its second season because it had become a caricature of itself, a
wildly uneven hour of empty pop-culture commentaries and lame
commercial spoofs. For the record, and to whatever extent this
taints my TV credentials, I was usually inside a movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, after plopping a couple tapes of ``Mad TV's'' new season
in the VCR the other day, one of which contained a long-winded
spoof of the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky farce, a couple things
were made clear: Nothing has really changed with ``Mad,'' which
makes me feel better for having ignored it. And we're in the midst
of a decline of sketch comedy as an art form.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe ``decline'' is the wrong word. That ``SNL'' remains the
stick from which new sketch comedy is measured strongly hints that
our expectations have been, well, compromised. People who admit to
still watching ``SNL'' are satisfied with two or three funny skits
during a 90-minute show.
</P>
<P>
   This is a relatively new phenomenon. For years ``SNL'' was such
a potent and steady player, others dipped toes into the water only
to scurry back to shore.
</P>
<P>
   Remember ``Fridays''? Featuring an unknown Michael Richards, it
was originally criticized as an ``SNL'' clone. It lasted just two
years. ``In Living Color'' was the best of the post-''SNL'' lot
until Keenen Ivory Wayans and Fox fell out, and the all-female
``She TV'' had its moments, but its backers had no patience.
Roseanne and Dana Carvey both tried and failed. Howard Stern? His
show is nothing more than radio on television, and bad radio on
television at that.
</P>
<P>
   So it'll be interesting to see whether the latest serious
contenders, HBO's ``Mr. Show With Bob and David'' and ``The Upright
Citizens Brigade'' on Comedy Central, can pump new life into this
tired genre.
</P>
<P>
   Both are, at least, ambitious. ``Mr. Show,'' whose new season
got under way Monday night, plays with absurdist comedy, an
uncompromising approach that originates from the taste-free zone
that has made ``South Park'' and its like-minded cronies darlings
of the toilet humor set.
</P>
<P>
   There are no talking, well, you know. But because this is cable,
front men Bob Odenkirk and David Cross, talented guys who are funny
by sheer looks alone, can tickle our funny bone with, say,
slow-motion vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   Other sketches include using marijuana as a stress deterrent and
cloning Hitlers to work as servants to Jewish families. I watched
two of this season's 10 half-hour editions, but ``amusing'' is the
highest compliment I can come up with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upright Citizens Brigade,'' on the air since Aug. 19, has a
decorated resume: Jury Prize for Best Alternative Sketch Act at the
U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, for one.
</P>
<P>
   The foursome (Matt Besser, Amy Poehler, Ian Roberts and Matt
Walsh) play members of an underground intelligence agency whose
stated goal is an ``ongoing mission to proliferate chaos,'' and
this premise flows through its sketches. I read somewhere that this
is a play on all this millennial anxiety and conspiracy theory
we've got going, but that must have zoomed right over my head.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague is certain that ``UCB'' is the bomb and that the
greatness, or lack thereof, of its humor might be a matter of
generational taste. It's a gentle way of reminding me that I'm not
a Gen-Xer, and therefore I'm hopelessly out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But what has always impressed me about ``UCB,'' which
formed in Chicago and carries the same Midwestern sensibility that
I possess, is its element of keeping one intellectually
off-balance. You actually have to pay attention. But I must admit
that they are far more effective as a stage act than on Comedy
Central.
</P>
<P>
   Still, networks keep trying. Even ABC is getting in on the
sketch comedy act. ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?'' probably got as
much ink as it did because it was such a mindboggling attempt at
prime-time improvisation. It didn't hurt to have Drew Carey as
bait, either.
</P>
<P>
   The series, in which Carey tosses out oddball topics for
impromptu sketches performed by talents like Ryan Stiles, was
irreverent enough to divert eyes from the batch of summer reruns.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?,'' sitting tight while
waiting for an ABC series to drop dead, might be the barometer for
the future of sketch comedy _ partly because it serves an audience
that wouldn't know improvisation if you hit it upside the head with
it.

PRI CANDIDATE WINNING IN NORTHEAST MEXICAN STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHILIP TRUE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Tomas Yarrington Ruvalcaba of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party claimed victory Monday in
gubernatorial elections in the northeastern state of Tamaulipas.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 90 percent of the vote counted in Sunday's election,
Yarrington led rival Gustavo Cardenas Gutierrez by nearly a 2-1
margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very content,'' Yarrington said by telephone from the
state capital of Ciudad Victoria. ``I love Tamaulipas and expect to
serve the state well for the next six years.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarrington said that soon after officially being declared the
winner, he would seek a meeting with Texas Gov. George W. Bush to
discuss regional development issues.
</P>
<P>
   Texas and the Mexican states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon form a
natural economic block, with at least 50 percent of the trade
between the United States and Mexico flowing through them, and
regional ties should be strengthened to enhance economic growth,
Yarrington said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that he is busy with his own re-election, but as soon
as we can find a good moment, I will go to meet with him,''
Yarrington said of Bush, who faces re-election next week.
</P>
<P>
   Yarrington will take office on Feb. 5 from outgoing PRI Gov.
Manuel Cavazos Lerma.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, of the center-right National Action Party, or PAN,
called the elections tainted and said he would present evidence of
vote fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a sickening fraud over the entire state,'' Cardenas
said. ``We have documentation of people being paid as much as 150
pesos (about $15) to vote for Yarrington. They spent money that I
don't know where it came from and shaved voters loyal to me off the
voting lists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They even refused to allow my father to vote, saying his name
did not appear on the polling sheet,'' Cardenas said.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas' father, Jorge Cardenas, was the first opposition mayor
ever elected in Yarrington's hometown of Matamoros in 1980. He also
ran against Cavazos in 1992 on the PAN ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Yarrington rejected the fraud charges, saying that observers
``from all over Mexico'' had watched the polling booths and found
no problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what he is talking about,'' Yarrington said of
Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   Incomplete results showed Yarrington was winning about 53
percent of the vote and Cardenas had 27 percent. Joaquin Hernandez
Correa of the center-left Democratic Revolution Party was a distant
third with 15 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Yarrington said the PRI lost only three of 43 mayoral races
during the statewide elections, while PAN lost all seven
mayoralties it had held.

WHAT'S AT THE ROOT OF `ALLY MCBEAL'S' HAIR OF IMPORTANCE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC CELESTE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal'' is silly but successful. Can we agree on this? I
direct this question to women, who, according to research conducted
outside this reporter's office, are McBeal's most avid followers.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that Monday night between 8 and 9 is the time you're
most likely to hear a TV viewer exclaim, ``Oh, that Ally! She's
just like me!'' An innocuous phenomenon, were it not that many who
assign stories about pop-culture trends strongly believe that every
Calista Flockhartian action signals a seismic change in the
American consciousness. (''Dancing with Internet babies is the new
rage!'')
</P>
<P>
   So it should come as no surprise that this reporter is writing
about last week's episode. What IS sending shockwaves through
demographically desirable households is that the show did indeed
reveal something astounding: Portia de Rossi, who plays attorney
Nelle Porter, has cultivated herself some long, sexy hair.
</P>
<P>
   If you think this wasn't important, you don't understand
``moments.'' Moments are flashes of televised imagery that sear
themselves into our minds _ perhaps even our souls, assuming such a
life force exists. Neil Armstrong's walking on the moon was a
moment. Lucy's eating chocolates off the conveyor belt: moment.
Portia de Rossi's turning around, pulling two carefully placed
chopsticks from her hair bun, the river of silky sexuality
cascading over her shoulders and, somehow, right into our hearts:
moment.
</P>
<P>
   De Rossi's hair let-down was transcendent television for many
reasons, one being that she was unshackling her tresses in the name
of Girl Power. (She was protesting the notion that women need to
look like men _ hair up or short _ to be taken seriously.) But more
important than why this moment so shook the editors of large
metropolitan dailies _ and, by extension, us all _ is what this
fascination with long, luxurious hair says about us.
</P>
<P>
   Hair worship has a long history. The biblical figure Samson, you
may have heard, was fond of his long locks. First Corinthians says
that if a woman has long hair, ``it is a glory to her.'' An Italian
proverb calls hair ``the beauty of a woman.'' Its ties to sexuality
are also well-established. Walt Whitman wrote of the woman who
``adorn'd herself and folded her hair expectantly.''
</P>
<P>
   But some say the de Rossi moment goes against what is considered
fashionable: Short, aggressive hairstyles dominate, in fashion
magazines and on Starbucks employees. What to make of this?
</P>
<P>
   ``Short hair can be as sexy as long hair,'' says Frank
Ploenissen, 30, an engineer from Belgium who runs a Web site
devoted to long hair (www.tlhs.org). ``Nevertheless, it seems the
majority of men prefer long hair, partly because they are tired of
the short-hair trends, partly because it stresses the femininity.''
Ploenissen also acknowledges the sexiness of the de Rossian
takedown: ``The act of taking the hair down is usually an intimate
action, and hence presumably narrows the distance between the
observer and the lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this fascination is simply a European thing. (Another
prominent long-hair Web page _ Long, Longer, Longest Hair, at
http:/members.xoom.com/ruehl/index2.htm _ is run by the
Deutschland's Frank Schoenbrodt, who calls it ``Eine Seite fur Fans
sehr langer Haare.'') Kim Jones (not her real last name, per her
request), an Irving-area high-tech employee, says she doesn't get
``the long-hair thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My boyfriend always gripes at me when I cut my hair short,''
she says. ``I don't understand it. It's so much easier to deal
with. But then again, I just got back from my 10-year high school
reunion, and the girls with the big '80s hair and the (heavy)
makeup still got all the attention from men. So maybe they (men)
just like it because they're pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. Our beguilement by ``Tomb Raider'' heroine Lara Croft
and tennis superstar Anna Kournikova could have much to do with the
fact that we usually see them with their long, gorgeously braided
hair. But it's not just men who are so taken by long tresses. Women
are just as likely to swoon at a de Rossian 'do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women do say things more than men,'' says Anne Warren, owner
of Orner &AMP; Warren Studios in Dallas and a former hair model. ``One
time I was in Bloomingdale's, in New York, going up the escalator,
and a woman started yelling at me to stop. She ran after me and
grabbed my arm in Ladies Handbags.'' The woman was amazed at
Warren's long blond hair. ``I told her I was from Dallas. She said,
`I knew it! No one in New York understands blond like they do in
Texas.'''
</P>
<P>
   Just as no one understands the simple rules of tapping into the
Zeitgeist like the folks at ``Ally McBeal'': When in need of buzz,
create a moment. When in need of a moment, find the one with the
best hair.

WHERE'S THE POETRY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 1)  
 (Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.)  
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you noticed the paucity of poetry in American public life,
especially in headlines? The Poetic Allusion Watch (PAW), once an
annual event in this space, has been shut out for lack of examples.
The last good entry submitted is from Donald Marks of New York,
citing a headline in the science section of The New York Times over
a story about snakes in Venezuela: ``Splendor in the Mud:
Unraveling the Lives of Anacondas.''
</P>
<P>
   The allusion is to Wordsworth's ``Intimations of Immortality,''
written between 1802 and 1807: ``Though nothing can bring back the
hour/ Of splendor in the grass, of glory in the flower.''
</P>
<P>
   And a couple of years ago, my colleague Anthony Lewis headlined
a diatribe at ``radical Republicans'' who would leave social
programs unfinanced as ``Bare Ruined Choirs.'' That comes from
Shakespeare's Sonnet 73 about the late autumn of life when the
leafless boughs of trees become ``bare ruined choirs where late the
sweet birds sang.''
</P>
<P>
   To stimulate an alertness to allusion, MAW was founded: the
Musical Allusion Watch, to detect veiled references to lyrics of
popular tunes. Deborah Stapleton of Mountain View, Calif., noted a
Wall Street Journal headline over a story about English
environmentalists trying to preserve traditional hedgerows: ``If
There's a Bustle in Your Hedgerow, Don't Be Alarmed.'' This is a
line from the 1971 Led Zeppelin song ``Stairway to Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms Stapleton suggests: ``The headline writer must have been
bursting with baby-boomer pride. When handed a story about guarding
hedgerows, he or she found a perfect opportunity to communicate to
the Wall Street establishment through lines sung in youth, often in
an altered state of mind. `Too weird,' as we might have said back
then.''
</P>
<P>
   With both PAW and MAW in a depression this year, what hope can
we find for the return of a sweet-seasoned shower of civilized
discourse? In an unexpected place: Resonances of our great
traditions of lyric language can be heard in the political
impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   At a historic moment in the House of Representatives, Henry
Hyde, white-haired chairman of the Judiciary Committee, rose to
rebut a charge that he was going to allow the investigation to roll
on for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me suggest to you,'' he told his colleagues, ``who think
this is going to go on, like Tennyson's brook, just on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   PAW members forget what he said after that, because we were
turning from the passions of the moment to Alfred Lord Tennyson's
1855 ``The Brook.'' It begins, ``I come from haunts of coot and
hern,/ I make a sudden sally,/ And sparkle out among the fern,/ To
bicker down a valley.'' The poem's last stanza: ``And out again I
curve and flow/ To join the brimming river; /For men may come and
men may go,/ But I go on for ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, by the way, has been referred to as a ``Solomonic Solon.''
This is an amalgam of two eponyms: Solomon was an ancient Hebrew
king noted for both his infant-splitting judicial gimmick and the
world-weary wisdom of Ecclesiastes, while Solon was a humane
Athenian lawgiver who reformed the harsh code of Draco.
</P>
<P>
   Not all poetic-sounding phrases that resonate are allusions to
poetry or musical lyrics, of course; some are rooted in dialectical
metaphor. ``In other days in the capital,'' intones a New York
Times editorial, ``the president could summon ... wise and
disinterested elders who, as the saying goes, had heard the owl and
seen the elephant.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the authorship of newspaper editorials is always
shrouded in institutional secrecy, a demonstrable need to know
enabled me to get the lowdown from a member of the editorial board
of the Suthrin persuasion: ``Just heard  &UR; heard the owl and seen the
elephant &LR;  down South as a reference to people seasoned to wisdom by
wide experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Deeper digging unearths an 1835 use by the Southwestern humorist
Augustus Baldwin Longstreet: ``That's sufficient, as Tom Haynes
said when he  &UR; saw the elephant &LR; .'' And a 1936 dictionary of cowboy
lingo reported, ``To have many and varied experiences was to ` &UR; hear
the owl hoot &LR; .'''
</P>
<P>
   SCHWONK?
</P>
<P>
   In the nefarious tapings often churned up by investigations can
be found the language as she is spoken.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a passage from the tape recordings released by the House
Judiciary Committee. Linda Tripp, the faithless friend, says to
Monica Lewinsky about the president, ``Right now I think he's a
 &UR; schwonk &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   This qualifies as what biblical exegetes call a  &UR; hapax
legomenon &LR; , the only known use in print, which makes it difficult
to define.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, Ms Lewinsky never addressed the  &UR; schwonk &LR;  word
in response,'' writes Evelyn Brody of Chicago, ``but it sounds to
me like the Yiddish version of `policy wonk' _ preceded by whatever
word starting in  &UR; sch &LR;  you prefer, from  &UR; schmuck &LR;  to
 &UR; schlemazel &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   We have already defined  &UR; schmuck &LR;  in this space as having lost
its original taboo sense to now mean ``jerk.'' A  &UR; schlemazel &LR;  is a
``loser.'' The shooshing sound at the beginning of a word has come
to suggest derogation.
</P>
<P>
   This brings us to  &UR; wonk &LR; . The Oxford English Dictionary's first
sense from 1900 is ``yellow dog,'' from the Chinese  &UR; huang
(``yellow'') gou (``dog'') &LR; . (No, we will not go into  &UR; yellow dog
Democrat &LR;  or the fund raising of John Huang in a language column.)
 &UR; Wonk &LR;  was soon applied as a term of contempt for young naval
cadets. In the 1960s, it replaced ``meatball'' and ``grind'' as a
putdown of an excessively studious student.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a touch of irony: The phrase  &UR; policy wonk &LR; , now widely
used to describe serious-minded politicians with too great a grasp
of minutiae, was coined in a 1984 New Republic article, referring
with scorn to Sen. Walter Mondale's ``thralldom to the  &UR; policy
wonks &LR;  and wise men of the Washington establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The coiner was Sidney Blumenthal, now the White House aide who
reported that President Clinton thought of Ms Lewinsky as being a
 &UR; stalker &LR; , meaning ``relentless groupie.'' We will have to await Ms
Tripp's memoirs, or her appearance before a congressional panel, to
see if she considers Coiner Blumenthal a  &UR; schwonk &LR; , whatever it
means.

 &HT;    
 By THOMAS MALLON  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On Feb. 20, 1962, John Glenn flew over a country with 80 million
fewer people than it has today, a land without ZIP codes and
throughout which three-quarters of the households still contained
both husbands and wives. Most of the wives were home that day, and
about the time Friendship 7 was rounding out its third orbit, some
of the husbands were rounding into a third martini at lunch. The
local record store, which may have been down the street from a
segregated hotel, had yet to stock a Beatles album.
 &HT;    Had the astronaut possessed a more powerful periscope than he
did, he still could not have picked out a St. Louis arch or a World
Trade Center to serve as a guidepost below. Not even Telstar, the
early communications satellite, was in the heavens to block his
path. The capsule's progress through the skies was relayed by
teletype from one tracking station to another.
 &HT;    ``In fact,'' says Gene Kranz, the legendary controller who was
directing the flight that morning, ``probably the most advanced
technology we worked with was the Atlantic cable, which had just
been relaid in 1956.''
 &HT;    After five hours, Friendship 7, not much bigger than the
Stratoloungers poised before millions of black-and-white TV sets
below, retrorocketed back to Earth. And as it roared through the
atmosphere like ``a real fireball,'' in the pilot's own calm words,
no one knew for certain that its heat shield wasn't about to fall
off.
 &HT;    A young but edgy country, with no idea of the decade it was
about to live through, leapt from its chairs and crowed over the
man who finally splashed down in the Atlantic. For the next several
weeks it heaped gratitude, relief and sheer unjaded delight on the
honest-to-God hero _ and regular fellow _ who had made this wild,
necessary ride. When it came time for his ticker-tape parade, there
was actual ticker tape to fling through the windows.
 &HT;    Today Glenn's return to space carries enormous public-relations
value to NASA _ this is the biggest manned-space story in years.
Nonetheless, Glenn sticks resolutely to medical-research terms in
discussing his mission's origin and meaning. And his wife Annie,
who will be watching him lift off, says that ``he's always wanted
to go'' back into space.
 &HT;    Yet after a three-decade political hiatus, what requalified him
was, oddly enough, getting old. Glenn, who has long served on the
Senate's Special Committee on Aging, was in his late 60s when he
sat down one weekend with a Merck manual on geriatrics and another
book called ``Space Physiology and Medicine,'' one of whose
authors, Dr. Arnauld E. Nicogossian, is now the associate
administrator of NASA's Division of Life and Microgravity Sciences
and Applications.
 &HT;    Looking through the manual, Glenn was struck by how many of the
natural processes of aging ``right here on Earth occur to the
younger people in their 30s, 40s and early 50s up there in space.''
 &HT;    The list included cardiovascular changes, immune-system
alterations and loss of bone density and muscle mass. Geriatric
research, he realized, was his ticket back into space. The next
step was to convince NASA to reserve him a seat.
 &HT;    As it happens, by the late 1980s, NASA researchers and
representatives of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) were also
discussing what they started calling ``parallel processes.''
 &HT;    Glenn made known his interest and kept pushing the issue in
dozens of discussions with gerontologists and NASA administrators.
Finally _ after what some say was considerable lobbying on his part
_ came this January's announcement of his place on shuttle mission
STS (Space Transportation System)-95.
 &HT;    Only when you walk behind Glenn, or fix your gaze on his right
eye, slightly more hooded than the left, can you credit the idea
that this man is closer to 80 than 70. It's a good thing he is too
_ or he might not have got his assignment.
 &HT;    Story Musgrave, who retired from the astronaut corps in 1997 at
age 62 after six shuttle flights, objected to the idea of Glenn's
going even before it was official: ``I stayed with the space
program and made it my career. He left 33 years ago and went into
politics.''
 &HT;    But from the gerontological point of view, Musgrave simply isn't
old enough for this mission. ``When we talked out at NIA about
this,'' Glenn says, ``they felt that the most productive assessment
will be done on somebody between 75 and 80. And I didn't suggest
that _ they suggested that. I'm the oldest used astronaut, I
guess.''
 &HT;    At the other end of the age spectrum, skeptical and even angry
postings started appearing right after the January announcement on
a Web site used by astronaut hopefuls: ``That's completely uncool
to let him jump in line like that for STS-95. Just because you can
fly a little ol' Mercury capsule around the Earth three times,
doesn't mean you should be bumped into a prime 10-day mission.
Sheesh.''
 &HT;    Jokes began immediately (Jay Leno said there would be no space
walk on STS-95 because NASA feared Glenn might ``wander off''), and
there were some dismaying editorials. The flight assignment was
``Nostalgia in Orbit'' to The New York Times, and ``the orbital
equivalent of the Lincoln Bedroom'' to an op-ed writer in USA
Today.
 &HT;    Some biologists expressed doubt about the usefulness of whatever
data Glenn would generate, and even a few of the thumbs-ups he got
were for the idea's inspirational, not scientific, value. At most,
Glenn is establishing a starting point for further geriatric
research. He has admitted that ``one person does not a database
make.''
 &HT;    But as John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at
George Washington University, cheerfully adds, ``One person a
database starts.'' And maybe, Glenn says, this ``opens up'' things
for some of the other veterans.
 &HT;    If Glenn is the only septuagenarian to go up, even his single
shot is likely to provide a psychological lift for senior citizens.
 &HT;    ``I think it's great,'' says Bob Dole, Glenn's longtime Senate
colleague and himself a recent medical test-subject, for the
anti-impotence drug Viagra. ``I think it probably gets people out
of their chairs'' and ``shows you never get too old to do these
things.''
 &HT;    In Glenn's case, the flight returns him not so much to his prime
as to his earliest ambition. ``If World War II hadn't come along,''
Annie Glenn says, ``he was either going to be a medical doctor or
go into medical research.'' Here at last, in fate's roundabout way,
comes his chance.
 -0- 
 &HT;    The Johnson Space Center these days has the tranquil look of a
state university. Birdsong floats over its clipped lawns and boxy
midcentury buildings. Some 1960s rockets, including a Saturn, sit
off in a grassy corner like old football trophies too big for a
display case. During most of the original astronauts' missions, the
center was still under construction for space personnel being
transferred from Langley Research Center in Virginia.
 &HT;    These days, the new astronauts among whom Glenn spends time are
``about half-again smarter than we ever thought of being back
then,'' he says. ``They're better educated and they're deeper into
science.''
 &HT;    They're also more diverse than the brush-cut, all-Protestant
test pilots introduced to the country in 1959. Along with Pedro
Duque, a European Space Agency astronaut from Spain, the STS-95
crew includes Chiaki Mukai, a medical doctor who four years ago
became the first Japanese woman to go into space.
 &HT;    If back in 1959, at their first news conference, Glenn did all
he could to stand out among the Original Seven astronauts _
famously raising two hands when a reporter asked which of the men
thought they would safely return to Earth _ 40 years later he is
doing his best to blend in. Except for an occasional lapse, he's
``John,'' not ``Senator Glenn,'' to the rest of the crew.
 &HT;    Two of Glenn's crewmates are doctors, and one of these is a
specialist in emergency medicine. But that's not, they all insist,
from any anxiety about an older-than-usual astronaut's being on
board. Glenn points out that Mukai was assigned to STS-95 more than
a year ago. Scott Parazynski, the other doctor, notes that two
doctors is ``actually par for the course'' for this kind of
``life-sciences emphasis'' flight.
 &HT;    In the early days of the space program, the astronauts insisted
that they be pilots, not passengers _ to be more than the chimps
who preceded them aloft. Glenn knows that regardless of the other
tasks he has been assigned (he's in charge of the photo equipment
and works with some experiments that don't involve his own
biology), he is on STS-95 essentially to accept punishment to his
aging body _ to be, in short, the monkey.
 &HT;    As ironies go, this one is more noble than cheap. Glenn jokes
that his bald head is perfectly designed for the electrodes that he
will wear. He knows that 10 days of weightlessness, some of it
free-floating, may induce not only a loss of muscle and bone but
also nausea _ certainly more of it than he ever had the chance to
experience during five hours strapped into the seat of Friendship
7.
 &HT;    The serious risk to Glenn's health may not be very great, but
the exhaustion is likely to be considerable, and no one at NASA
wants the most memorable photo of STS-95 to be one of Glenn being
carried off the orbiter on a stretcher.
 &HT;    The toll this flight may take on Glenn's status as cultural
legend is probably even less predictable. His return to space could
play out like a lackluster movie sequel, diminishing memories of
the long-ago flight that made him such an icon, and NASA's PR coup
could backfire if Glenn's return adds only to the nostalgia that
dominates public consciousness of the space program.
 &HT;    But the hotels around Cape Canaveral have for months been booked
solid for Oct. 29. And whatever reminiscence it provokes, Glenn's
flight will also begin one entirely forward-looking enterprise: the
movement of civilians into space.
 &HT;    And, oddly enough, it will be Glenn, a plumber's son who became
so mythic that John F. Kennedy was disinclined to risk putting him
on another flight, who may get NASA past the most lingering trauma
of Challenger: the death of Christa McAuliffe, the schoolteacher.
The agency picked the moment of its announcement about Glenn to
declare that Barbara Morgan, the teacher who trained as McAuliffe's
backup a dozen years ago, has been accepted into the next group of
regular astronaut trainees.

public relations of STS-95 will drop away with the shuttle's rocket
boosters. This is especially so for the minority of Americans old
enough to recall Feb. 20, 1962 _ and for those oldest citizens
whose physical needs are the official justification for Glenn's
place on the flight.
 &HT;    What is Glenn's biggest anxiety about this mission? He'll be

1962. ``My main concern,'' he says, ``is that I just not mess up.''
 &HT;    As she watches him lift off, his wife Annie will be quietly
resurrecting the attitude with which she waited out World War II,
Korea, test-piloting at Patuxent River and Project Mercury:
``John's like a cat with nine lives.'' If something happens, she
will ``always live with the idea that John went the way John would
like to. That's been my way of life, I think.''

 By THOMAS MALLON  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On Feb. 20, 1962, John Glenn flew over a country with 80 million
fewer people than it has today, a land without ZIP codes and
throughout which three-quarters of the households still contained
both husbands and wives. Most of the wives were home that day, and
about the time Friendship 7 was rounding out its third orbit, some
of the husbands were rounding into a third martini at lunch. The
local record store, which may have been down the street from a
segregated hotel, had yet to stock a Beatles album.
 &HT;    Had the astronaut possessed a more powerful periscope than he
did, he still could not have picked out a St. Louis arch or a World
Trade Center to serve as a guidepost below. Not even Telstar, the
early communications satellite, was in the heavens to block his
path. The capsule's progress through the skies was relayed by
teletype from one tracking station to another.
 &HT;    ``In fact,'' says Gene Kranz, the legendary controller who was
directing the flight that morning, ``probably the most advanced
technology we worked with was the Atlantic cable, which had just
been relaid in 1956.''
 &HT;    After five hours, Friendship 7, not much bigger than the
Stratoloungers poised before millions of black-and-white TV sets
below, retrorocketed back to Earth. And as it roared through the
atmosphere like ``a real fireball,'' in the pilot's own calm words,
no one knew for certain that its heat shield wasn't about to fall
off.
 &HT;    A young but edgy country, with no idea of the decade it was
about to live through, leapt from its chairs and crowed over the
man who finally splashed down in the Atlantic. For the next several
weeks it heaped gratitude, relief and sheer unjaded delight on the
honest-to-God hero _ and regular fellow _ who had made this wild,
necessary ride. When it came time for his ticker-tape parade, there
was actual ticker tape to fling through the windows.
 &HT;    Today Glenn's return to space carries enormous public-relations
value to NASA _ this is the biggest manned-space story in years.
Nonetheless, Glenn sticks resolutely to medical-research terms in
discussing his mission's origin and meaning. And his wife Annie,
who will be watching him lift off, says that ``he's always wanted
to go'' back into space.
 &HT;    Yet after a three-decade political hiatus, what requalified him
was, oddly enough, getting old. Glenn, who has long served on the
Senate's Special Committee on Aging, was in his late 60s when he
sat down one weekend with a Merck manual on geriatrics and another
book called ``Space Physiology and Medicine,'' one of whose
authors, Dr. Arnauld E. Nicogossian, is now the associate
administrator of NASA's Division of Life and Microgravity Sciences
and Applications.
 &HT;    Looking through the manual, Glenn was struck by how many of the
natural processes of aging ``right here on Earth occur to the
younger people in their 30s, 40s and early 50s up there in space.''
 &HT;    The list included cardiovascular changes, immune-system
alterations and loss of bone density and muscle mass. Geriatric
research, he realized, was his ticket back into space. The next
step was to convince NASA to reserve him a seat.
 &HT;    As it happens, by the late 1980s, NASA researchers and
representatives of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) were also
discussing what they started calling ``parallel processes.''
 &HT;    Glenn made known his interest and kept pushing the issue in
dozens of discussions with gerontologists and NASA administrators.
Finally _ after what some say was considerable lobbying on his part
_ came this January's announcement of his place on shuttle mission
STS (Space Transportation System)-95.
 &HT;    Only when you walk behind Glenn, or fix your gaze on his right
eye, slightly more hooded than the left, can you credit the idea
that this man is closer to 80 than 70. It's a good thing he is too
_ or he might not have got his assignment.
 &HT;    Story Musgrave, who retired from the astronaut corps in 1997 at
age 62 after six shuttle flights, objected to the idea of Glenn's
going even before it was official: ``I stayed with the space
program and made it my career. He left 33 years ago and went into
politics.''
 &HT;    But from the gerontological point of view, Musgrave simply isn't
old enough for this mission. ``When we talked out at NIA about
this,'' Glenn says, ``they felt that the most productive assessment
will be done on somebody between 75 and 80. And I didn't suggest
that _ they suggested that. I'm the oldest used astronaut, I
guess.''
 &HT;    At the other end of the age spectrum, skeptical and even angry
postings started appearing right after the January announcement on
a Web site used by astronaut hopefuls: ``That's completely uncool
to let him jump in line like that for STS-95. Just because you can
fly a little ol' Mercury capsule around the Earth three times,
doesn't mean you should be bumped into a prime 10-day mission.
Sheesh.''
 &HT;    Jokes began immediately (Jay Leno said there would be no space
walk on STS-95 because NASA feared Glenn might ``wander off''), and
there were some dismaying editorials. The flight assignment was
``Nostalgia in Orbit'' to The New York Times, and ``the orbital
equivalent of the Lincoln Bedroom'' to an op-ed writer in USA
Today.
 &HT;    Some biologists expressed doubt about the usefulness of whatever
data Glenn would generate, and even a few of the thumbs-ups he got
were for the idea's inspirational, not scientific, value. At most,
Glenn is establishing a starting point for further geriatric
research. He has admitted that ``one person does not a database
make.''
 &HT;    But as John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at
George Washington University, cheerfully adds, ``One person a
database starts.'' And maybe, Glenn says, this ``opens up'' things
for some of the other veterans.
 &HT;    If Glenn is the only septuagenarian to go up, even his single
shot is likely to provide a psychological lift for senior citizens.
 &HT;    ``I think it's great,'' says Bob Dole, Glenn's longtime Senate
colleague and himself a recent medical test-subject, for the
anti-impotence drug Viagra. ``I think it probably gets people out
of their chairs'' and ``shows you never get too old to do these
things.''
 &HT;    In Glenn's case, the flight returns him not so much to his prime
as to his earliest ambition. ``If World War II hadn't come along,''
Annie Glenn says, ``he was either going to be a medical doctor or
go into medical research.'' Here at last, in fate's roundabout way,
comes his chance.
 -0- 
 &HT;    The Johnson Space Center these days has the tranquil look of a
state university. Birdsong floats over its clipped lawns and boxy
midcentury buildings. Some 1960s rockets, including a Saturn, sit
off in a grassy corner like old football trophies too big for a
display case. During most of the original astronauts' missions, the
center was still under construction for space personnel being
transferred from Langley Research Center in Virginia.
 &HT;    These days, the new astronauts among whom Glenn spends time are
``about half-again smarter than we ever thought of being back
then,'' he says. ``They're better educated and they're deeper into
science.''
 &HT;    They're also more diverse than the brush-cut, all-Protestant
test pilots introduced to the country in 1959. Along with Pedro
Duque, a European Space Agency astronaut from Spain, the STS-95
crew includes Chiaki Mukai, a medical doctor who four years ago
became the first Japanese woman to go into space.
 &HT;    If back in 1959, at their first news conference, Glenn did all
he could to stand out among the Original Seven astronauts _
famously raising two hands when a reporter asked which of the men
thought they would safely return to Earth _ 40 years later he is
doing his best to blend in. Except for an occasional lapse, he's
``John,'' not ``Senator Glenn,'' to the rest of the crew.
 &HT;    Two of Glenn's crewmates are doctors, and one of these is a
specialist in emergency medicine. But that's not, they all insist,
from any anxiety about an older-than-usual astronaut's being on
board. Glenn points out that Mukai was assigned to STS-95 more than
a year ago. Scott Parazynski, the other doctor, notes that two
doctors is ``actually par for the course'' for this kind of
``life-sciences emphasis'' flight.
 &HT;    In the early days of the space program, the astronauts insisted
that they be pilots, not passengers _ to be more than the chimps
who preceded them aloft. Glenn knows that regardless of the other
tasks he has been assigned (he's in charge of the photo equipment
and works with some experiments that don't involve his own
biology), he is on STS-95 essentially to accept punishment to his
aging body _ to be, in short, the monkey.
 &HT;    As ironies go, this one is more noble than cheap. Glenn jokes
that his bald head is perfectly designed for the electrodes that he
will wear. He knows that 10 days of weightlessness, some of it
free-floating, may induce not only a loss of muscle and bone but
also nausea _ certainly more of it than he ever had the chance to
experience during five hours strapped into the seat of Friendship
7.
 &HT;    The serious risk to Glenn's health may not be very great, but
the exhaustion is likely to be considerable, and no one at NASA
wants the most memorable photo of STS-95 to be one of Glenn being
carried off the orbiter on a stretcher.
 &HT;    The toll this flight may take on Glenn's status as cultural
legend is probably even less predictable. His return to space could
play out like a lackluster movie sequel, diminishing memories of
the long-ago flight that made him such an icon, and NASA's PR coup
could backfire if Glenn's return adds only to the nostalgia that
dominates public consciousness of the space program.
 &HT;    But the hotels around Cape Canaveral have for months been booked
solid for Oct. 29. And whatever reminiscence it provokes, Glenn's
flight will also begin one entirely forward-looking enterprise: the
movement of civilians into space.
 &HT;    And, oddly enough, it will be Glenn, a plumber's son who became
so mythic that John F. Kennedy was disinclined to risk putting him
on another flight, who may get NASA past the most lingering trauma
of Challenger: the death of Christa McAuliffe, the schoolteacher.
The agency picked the moment of its announcement about Glenn to
declare that Barbara Morgan, the teacher who trained as McAuliffe's
backup a dozen years ago, has been accepted into the next group of
regular astronaut trainees.
 &HT;    At the mention of this ``civilian'' business, Glenn fairly rolls
his eyes. ``I don't know what they think I am,'' he says. ``I spent
a career in the military. I was in the space program. They're not
gettin' a new boy.''
 &HT;    When the Discovery takes Glenn back into space, the science and
public relations of STS-95 will drop away with the shuttle's rocket
boosters. This is especially so for the minority of Americans old
enough to recall Feb. 20, 1962 _ and for those oldest citizens
whose physical needs are the official justification for Glenn's
place on the flight.
 &HT;    What is Glenn's biggest anxiety about this mission? He'll be
thinking in the same quiet, right-stuff italics he did on Feb. 20,

PEACE COUNTRY AT WAR: ATTACKS TARGET PETROLEUM INTERESTS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAVERLODGE, Alberta _ It started two years ago with isolated
acts of vandalism aimed at the petroleum industry, whose
fast-expanding oil and gas fields have transformed Alberta into
Canada's boom province.
</P>
<P>
   A set of tires slashed here, a remote equipment shed torched
there. The pattern was clearly more than could be written off to
the usual Saturday night hell-raisers, but still no cause for real
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Today, counterterrorism experts and special investigation teams
from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police are swarming into Alberta's
northwest in an effort to quash a campaign of bomb blasts and other
violence against petroleum facilities, believed to be the work of
environmental radicals. The attacks have caused millions of
dollars' worth of damage and left oil workers across the province
afraid for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mounties so far have failed to nail the night-riding
eco-terrorists or restore law and order to Alberta's rugged Peace
Country, named for the Peace River.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more oil wells up here than there are intersections,
and there is no way of guarding them all,'' said Sergeant Dave
MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion swirls around a fundamentalist Christian commune whose
Dutch-born patriarch is given to uttering fiery threats against the
oil industry. ``Sometimes, war has to be waged,'' said Wiebo Ludwig
Sr., a 56-year-old former pastor. Ludwig says that leaks of ``sour
gas,'' or hydrogen sulphide _ an extremely toxic natural gas _ from
wells near the commune and the town of Hythe have caused
miscarriages among women in his following and the deaths of scores
of the clan's cattle. ``It is morally, ethically, and legally
permissable to defend your family in whatever way necessary when
other ways aren't working,'' he added. Amid the gathering tensions,
an oil company official was shot dead by an angry farmer earlier
this month following a dispute over soil contamination caused by an
oil operation. And last week a homemade bomb exploded at a gas well
near Beaverlodge, in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies. The
violence in Alberta was echoed in the American Rockies last week,
as eco-terrorists in Vail, Colo., burned a ski lodge and torched
other resort buildings, causing $12 million in damage. In Canada,
meanwhile, law-abiding environmental activists warn that the wave
of eco-terrorism is shifting attention away from serious health
issues resulting from the extraordinary expansion of the oil and
gas industry in Alberta and British Columbia over the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials say more than 160 acts of serious sabotage _
including bomb blasts, shootings, arson, and even the pouring of
metal-eating acid onto pipeline control panels _ have hit Alberta
oil field facilities in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe that the actual number of attacks is at least
twice as high, because smaller oil outfits do not report incidents
to avoid drawing more hostile attention to their little-regulated
operations. Forestry and utility companies have also been struck by
saboteurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a siege of terror, and it's escalating,'' said Ed
McGillivray, director of environment, health, and safety for
Calgary-based Alberta Energy Co. Ltd., one of Canada's largest oil
and gas producers, and one of the major targets in the oil field
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our employees are feeling a great deal of frustration, angst
and out-and-out fear,'' he said. ``It seems unreal, this happening
in Canada, where people take special pride in being peaceful and
law-abiding. You realize that terrorism can strike anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Peace Country, scene of most of the attacks, is one of the
epicenters of the oil boom that since the 1980s has transformed
Alberta from an agrarian realm of grain fields and cattle ranges
into the hottest economy in Canada, with small-scale wildcatters
and major league oil companies staking millions almost daily on the
next big strike.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 12,000 new gas and oil wells _ a record _ were drilled in
Alberta last year. The biggest concerns are not the wells, but the
tower-mounted flares used to burn off surplus gas from the oil
fields. There are today more than 5,200 ``flaring well'' sites in
Alberta compared with only a few hundred a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The flaring of the gas is to burn off toxins and prevent them
from entering the air. According to critics, these flares,
especially sour-gas flares, may be releasing dangerous levels of
chemical contaminants because of incomplete combustion.
</P>
<P>
   The health effects, if any, are in bitter dispute. But industry
analysts note that the flaring of gas is far more tightly regulated
in such American states as Texas than in Alberta. ``We're way
behind the times,'' Paul Edson, an environmental consultant for
industry and landowners, told Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper.
``I would say we're comparable to a Third World nation. We've got
Russia-style pollution controls.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry and provincial government dispute this.
``Sustainable development is the Alberta way, and our environmental
standards are second to none,'' said provincial Premier Ralph
Klein.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no disputing that the industry is disliked and
mistrusted by many ranchers, farmers, and other rural Albertans.
And alarm bells are starting to ring in Calgary and Edmonton as
drilling operations move ever closer to the province's only major
urban centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing new about problems involving animal health and
human health, I've been seeing them for 20 years, but they are
becoming more acute as petroleum activity becomes more intensive
and more widespread,'' said Martha Kostuch, a veterinarian and
well-known critic of some oil company practices in Alberta. ``The
problems are pretty broad, from reproductive and neurological
damage in animals, contamination of ground water, and symptoms
ranging from runny noses to bad headaches and chronic fatigue in
humans.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems seem worst in the area of sour-gas flares, where
farmers routinely complain of cattle suffering spontaneous
abortions and low milk yields. Hydrogen sulphide is one of the most
dangerous substances in the world, capable of killing a person
exposed to as little as 500 parts per million.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The very deadliness of the gas provides the most powerful
argument against those responsible for the campaign of bombings. An
explosion could blow out a flare and rupture pipelines, injecting
quantities of the raw toxin into the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vandalism is a lot more dangerous to landowners than
whatever the oil companies are doing,'' said farmer Andre Harper.
``Someone is going to get badly hurt if this keeps going on.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 3, an employee of KB Resources, a petroleum company, was
shot dead as he inspected an oil well drilled on a farm near
Calgary. The shooting reportedly occurred following a dispute over
possible contamination caused by the well. Farmer Eifion Wyn
Roberts has been charged with first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   The deadly incident apparently was unrelated to vandalism
against oil facilities. But it occurred in an atmosphere of rising
tension and mistrust, and the most ardent enemies of the oil
companies were quick to warn that more trouble may be in store.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies have to stop what they are doing,'' said Ludwig,
leader of the 32-member fundamentalist homestead called Trickle
Creek Farm. ``People are talking here about maybe someone should
start shooting guys in pinstripe suits to get them to stop.''

   SCI-MOOSE-REBOUND (Greenville, Maine) _ Usually, no one has to
sneak up on a moose. At the turn of this century, moose had been
all but wiped out. Now hunting is tightly controlled and many farms
have reverted to forest. Natural predators like wolves have been
eliminated from much of the north woods. And logging has converted
great stretches of the woods to young forests, where tender leaves
and twigs are at just the right height for a moose. The result has
been a population explosion among moose. And they've been spotted
as far south as New Haven, Conn. By William K. Stevens. (1970

was to drop predator scents in the form of wolf urine and bear
scats near the moose and observe their reactions. So the two

 &HT;    NETANYAHU PUSHES PEACE PLAN AMID NEW VIOLENCE IN WEST BANK
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Threats to the heralded peace agreement signed by
Israelis and Palestinians last week became all too clear here
Monday, as murderers felled victims on both sides and the cries of
extremists became louder in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spent the day
in meetings trying to clear the way for government approval of the
peace plan -- apparently with some success -- events were
undercutting confidence in it.
</P>
<P>
   A security guard in the controversial Jewish settlement in the
heart of the Palestinian city of Hebron was killed and left by a
road Monday afternoon, apparently by extremist Palestinians. It was
the first murder of an Israeli since signing of the Wye peace
agreement last week.
</P>
<P>
   Monday evening, police found the body of a Palestinian after an
anonymous, Hebrew-speaking, caller said he had avenged the security
guard's death.
</P>
<P>
   Under the peace agreement signed in Washington Friday, Israel is
scheduled to turn over another 13 percent of land in the West Bank
to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
   That would put about 40 percent of the West Bank, which the
Israelis have occupied since capturing it in the 1967 war, under
full or partial Palestinian control. The plan is a continuation of
the 1993 Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   The land hand-over is supposed to start after Netanyahu wins the
approval of his cabinet, made up of members of several parties in
his coalition. That approval was expected later this week, but
Netanyahu was also trying to defend himself against former
supporters who now aim to unseat him through parliamentary motions
for new elections.
</P>
<P>
   While a newspaper poll Sunday showed a large majority of
Israelis backing the plan, Netanyahu is focused on the right-wing
minority, once part of his coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred right-wing settlers and their supporters
gathered outside Netanyahu's residence Monday night to protest the
day's killing, and call for his ouster.
</P>
<P>
   It was the biggest of several such protests since the agreement
was signed in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deaths like the one that happened today will happen because of
these agreements,'' said Jerusalem resident Moshe Matitaya(CQ),
referring to the settler who was killed. ``You're going to see
massacres all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters chanted ``traitor,'' a cry that has become
ominous in Israel since it was repeatedly hurled by the same groups
at former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. He was assassinated by an
Israeli extremist after he signed the original Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition of groups opposing the agreement took out a
front-page advertisement in the English-language Jerusalem Post
warning Netanyahu, ``You are responsible for this shameful
agreement. We voted for you and we put you in power . . . we won't
forget . . . and we won't forgive.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu Monday handily defeated a parliamentary no-confidence
motion against him, which would have required new elections if
passed, by a comfortable margin.
</P>
<P>
   But, that victory was largely because left-wing members of the
parliament, who support Oslo but usually oppose Netanyahu, have
promised to support him for two weeks while he is beginning to
implement the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a bill calling for new elections early next year and
supported by the left wing, primarily the Labor Party, made another
step through the parliament by passing a key committee in a close
vote.
</P>
<P>
   In a development that appeared to answer a lingering question
from the peace talks, Israeli media reported that Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon was pushing hard to win support for Netanyahu and the
peace plan. Sharon, a controversial right-winger who had opposed
the plan until shortly before becoming foreign minister earlier
this month, could be the ally who guarantees Netanyahu's success.

REPUBLICANS BESET BY INTERNAL SQUABBLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The internal struggles that have smoldered just
below the surface of Republican Party politics for years have
broken into the open with surprising force recently.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans, fanning out across the country this weekend to
campaign for the midterm congressional elections nine days away,
are having second thoughts about their party's drive to impeach
President Clinton. After the budget agreement, House and Senate
Republicans ended the regular session of the 105th Congress last
week by accusing one another of selling out to a discredited
president.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some GOP congressional candidates are still nursing
wounds from a series of challenges the party's Christian Right
insurgents mounted against its more mainstream members. Yet,
contenders for the party's presidential nomination in 2000 have
been courting those same religious conservatives, who are so
important in early caucus and primary states such as Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   This all comes at the end of a year in which the split between
social and economic conservatives on Capitol Hill has, for the
first time since the Republicans took control of Congress four
years ago, altered the course of legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``At base,'' says John Green, a University of Akron specialist
on the Christian Right, ``the differences between these groups are
very real.''
</P>
<P>
   On just one day this summer, for example, Republican leaders
decided not to push for a large tax cut this year _ and to put off
considering legislation that would require the United States to
punish nations that acquiesced in religious persecution. The first
development was a big blow to the economic conservatives in the
party, who had hoped to use the tax issue in the fall elections.
The second was a setback to religious conservatives, who believe
the nation's foreign policy should side with American moral vaues
rather than American marketplace interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this moment, the divisions in the Republican Party are
deeper than those in the Democratic Party,'' said Democratic
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut. ``The divisions have
more political consequences in the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   These differences shaped the last beleaguered days of the
regular congressional session. The dispute can be distilled to a
simple fight about what to do with the budget surplus that, only a
year ago, almost nobody thought would materialize. Senate
Republicans wanted to spend the money, House Republicans wanted to
use it to underwrite a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The result is confusion. ``What does the Republican majority
stand for?'', Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska wrote in an angry
letter to his colleagues this month. ``Do we have an agenda? What
is it? Do we believe in anything?''
</P>
<P>
   The fault lines run deepest on four issues:
</P>
<P>
   Approach to Clinton: Republicans in Congress may agree that
Clinton is a flawed moral leader but they don't agree on how to
deal with him. In one theater of operations, the House Judiciary
Committee, the momentum is clearly on the side of impeaching the
president and forcing a trial in the Senate, a view that may be
tempered if the GOP doesn't make the gains it expects on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   But in another theater _ the legislative negotiations between
GOP congressional leaders and the Democrats in the White House _
the Republicans have repeatedly flinched, showing weakness against
Clinton, disgraced as he may be. Underpinning all of this, GOP
insiders say, is a real fear of Clinton's negotiating ability and
political prowess, _ and much of their finger-pointing in the past
several days derives from their reluctance to 'fess up to that.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el2 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Trade: Republicans break down on trade issues between
free-traders such as House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia and
protectionists such as political commentator (and former
presidential aspirant) Patrick J. Buchanan. The two sides differed
on giving the president ``fast-track'' authority to negotiate a
free-trade agreement with other nations on an accelerated basis.
The big confrontation between these groups occurred last winter,
but it was reprised this fall, when Gingrich brought the issue back
to the House floor, only to have it defeated again.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el2 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Business: When Main Street and Wall Street interests clash, the
dispute often takes the form of struggles between small-business
groups, which passionately oppose government regulation, and big
businesses, which have grown accustomed to regulation and even to
prosper under it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el2 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Economics: For decades, Republicans couldn't agree whether the
emphasis of national economic policy should be to shrink the
deficits (the preference of traditional conservatives in the party)
or to cut taxes (the preference of the new conservatives, who
regard high taxes as an obstacle to personal liberty). Now, of
course, the budget deficit is gone, but the national debt, which is
the cumulative effect of years of deficits, remains _ and so does
the dispute between the two camps.
</P>
<P>
   The economic conservatives, who stress high growth and low
taxes, and the social conservatives, who stress issues such as
restricting abortions and promoting school prayer, have circled
each other warily for years. They coexisted in the coalitions that
elected Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984, and George Bush in 1988,
but tensions between the two groups plagued Bob Dole's campaign in
1996. In recent months, those tensions have reached new heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most visible split and it is a real divide,'' says
Allen Hertzke, a University of Oklahoma political scientist who
studies religious conservatives. ``But the Republican Party cannot
win without the evangelical electorate and a strong turnout. They
have become a major portion of the American electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Election Study found that seven of 10 white
evangelicals voted Republican in the 1994 midterm congressional
elections that brought the Republicans to majority power on Capitol
Hill. These same white evangelicals accounted for one out of three
Republican votes, displacing mainline Protestants as the largest
element of the GOP coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, James Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family, began
increasing the pressure, reminding Republican leaders of the
contribution that religious conservatives make to the party. He
demanded that the GOP Congress take up more of the Christian agenda
_ including bills to eliminate the marriage penalty in the tax
code, and new restrictions on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In response, congressional leaders promised some votes on
symbolic issues, such as the trade status given to China, where the
party's business interests see an enormous market and where its
religious conservatives see human-rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans fear that even such minimal pledges
endanger the party's prospects. This summer, the Republican
Leadership Council released a poll showing that voters in heavily
contested districts would, by a 3-to-1 ratio, be more likely to
vote for Republican congressional candidates if Congress emphasized
economic issues over moral issues.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, the two sides actually relished the confrontation
that was prompted when the state party chairman, David Miller,
decided to challenge the sitting governor, Bill Graves, for the GOP
gubernatorial nomination. ``I am running because of what I
believe,'' Miller said in an interview. ``I am an unapologetic,
traditional mainstream conservative Republican, and the governor is
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves, who prevailed in the early August primary, was
astonished by the challenge. ``You don't expect your state chairman
to run against you at a time when most Kansans think things are
going pretty well and after we cut taxes four times in a row,''
Graves said.
</P>
<P>
   For a party coveting the White House in 2000, it behooves the
Republicans to avert that kind of Kansas confrontation on a
national level. It won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Two politicians with close ties to religious conservatives,
Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri and Gary Bauer, who heads the
Family Research Council, are actively considering presidential
campaigns. Magazine publisher Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., a veteran of
the '96 primaries and ordinarily considered one of the high priests
of the economic-conservative camp, has been trying to bridge the
gap, cozying up to religious conservatives, appearing in Washington
with the leadership of the Christian Coalition, and making the
fight against abortion one of the principal issues in his radio
advertisements and luncheon speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many religious conservatives continue to feel unwelcome
in their own party. ``There are still Republican elites who
actually don't fully understand this constituency _ and a lot of
them don't even like them, or have any affinity for them,'' said
Hertzke, the Oklahoma specialist on the Christian Right. For that
reason, the Republicans' strongest foes in the years to come may
not be Democrats _ but fellow Republicans.

GENES OF HINDU WOMEN DIFFER WITH CASTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   India's one billion Hindus still generally observe a caste
system which prohibits members born into one caste from marrying
into another. The system is thought to have prevailed for more than
2,000 years, long enough to have impressed a subtle genetic
signature on the population, according to a team of American and
Indian biologists.
</P>
<P>
   Although marriage within one's own caste is strongly preferred,
women are occasionally allowed to marry men of higher caste, with
their children assuming their father's status.
</P>
<P>
   This practice gives rise to a rigidly stratified population in
which women have slight upward mobility but men none.
</P>
<P>
   Population geneticists can track the lineages of men and women
separately by looking at regions of DNA that are inherited
exclusively through the male line (the Y chromosome) or the female
line (the mitochondria, cellular organelles bequeathed by the egg
and not the sperm).
</P>
<P>
   Sampling DNA from people of various castes in Andhra Pradesh, a
province in southern India, the biologists report in last week's
issue of Nature that there is indeed a significant genetic
distance, as measured by the number of differences in the DNA,
between women in the higher and lower castes.
</P>
<P>
   The differences can be explained by a low level of gene flow
carried by women moving one way in a firmly layered system. If
women moved both ways, or not at all, there would be little
difference between the castes.
</P>
<P>
   The differences in DNA from the Y chromosome, on the other hand,
were minor and probably arose from random mutation, the researchers
say.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA differences in question make no difference to the people
involved because they are not part of the genes. Population
geneticists prefer to study non-gene DNA because it changes quite
often, whereas most mutations in the genes are harmful and quickly
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael J. Bamshad of the University of Utah, a co-author of
the study, said that he and his colleagues at Andhra University in
India hoped to extend their methods to explore the population
history of India and the role of different groups in the caste
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a greater Asian influence in the lower and
middle castes, and a greater Caucasian contribution to the upper
castes,'' he said, a finding which probably reflects the
Indoeuropean invasion of India.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic traces of women trickling up through the caste
system, Bamshad said, ``demonstrates that social proceses such as
mating patterns can leave an indelible imprint on the human genome.
It also shows how powerful genetic analysis is for revealing human
history.''

<P>
   A $40 million research program has proved that sound can be used
to measure the temperature of the world's oceans and detect
long-term climate change, scientists say. But the project has spent
so much money meeting demands by environmental groups that its
leaders expect to have to end the program a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment, called Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (or
``ATOC,'' pronounced ``aye-tock,'') is based on precise
measurements of the speed of sound through oceans; the warmer the
water, the faster sound travels. The ATOC consortium, comprising
research teams from eight institutions in the United States and
Australia, published a summary of its results in a recent issue of
the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment initially aroused strong opposition from the
wildlife lobby and several environmental organizations on grounds
that the sounds generated by underwater loudspeakers used in the
tests would disturb wildlife, alter animal behavior and perhaps
endanger whales and other animals.
</P>
<P>
   The ATOC physicists and acoustics experts argued that the low
rumbling sound they planned to propagate into the water in short
occasional pulses was no louder than the sound of passing ships and
only slightly louder than the calls of blue whales.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, ATOC scientists agreed that it was important to
protect wildlife but would not accede to some of the demands by the
various groups. Finally in 1995, after spending $2.9 million from
its acoustic research budget on animal studies and legal expenses,
ATOC began its experiment, as modified to comply with the demands
of the lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loss of all that money so weakened us that we expect to
have to end our work one year from now when our funding runs out,''
said Dr. Walter Munk of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at
La Jolla, Calif., a senior ATOC scientist. ``Because of the many
delays and legal costs,'' he said, ``we've only been able to
collect a year and a half's worth of data _ too little to detect
global warming from a greenhouse effect. We would need a decade of
data to see it. It's very sad to have to stop at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The ATOC collaboration contends its experiment would have had to
have run for at least 10 years to unequivocally detect global
greenhouse warming _ a goal they say would have been attainable if
they had been spared the expenses of meeting demands by lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   The ATOC project has been supported since 1990 by research
institutions in eight nations and the National Academy of Sciences,
the Office of Naval Research, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration and various universities.
</P>
<P>
   Sound can travel through water for enormous distances, prevented
from dissipating its acoustic energy by boundaries in the ocean
created by water layers of differing temperatures and densities. In
the final version of the ATOC experiment, loudspeakers were
installed at two sites: one off the northwest coast of Hawaii's Big
Island, and the other near Pioneer Seamount, a volcanic island in
the Pacific Ocean 55 miles from San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The times of arrival of the sound at thousands of underwater
microphones spanning the Pacific Ocean were then recorded and
interpreted as water temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of the ATOC system over traditional arrays of
thermometers on buoys and ships is that it takes an integrated
measurement of temperature all along the path the sound takes,
averaging the temperatures of water over hundreds or thousands of
miles. Systems reliant on spot temperatures fail to collect enough
data from regions of the oceans sparsely covered by sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Another method of measuring oceanic heat is used by a
French-American radar satellite named Topex/Poseidon, which can
detect changes in sea level of as little as a few inches. Changes
in sea level result from changes in water temperature (and
therefore its density) and from the melting of glaciers. Satellite
measurements alone cannot distinguish between these effects.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   But when data from the ATOC array is combined with radar sea
level measurements, it is possible to calculate how much of an
increase in sea level is attributable to the warming of water
alone, and over a period of years, such measurements can reveal a
global warming of the seas by a warming atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   No other technique has been discovered that can yield this
global-scale information with such accuracy, the investigators say.
Moreover, data combined from satellite sea level measurements and
ATOC-type speed-of-sound measurements are expected to greatly
improve mathematical models simulating the behavior of the earth's
climate.
</P>
<P>
   Although the debate over the effects of ATOC sounds on marine
animals persists, biologists who conducted tests reported that
effects were apparently not injurious.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Adam S. Frankel of Cornell University, a biologist who
specializes in acoustics, was one of the scientists commissioned by
the ATOC consortium to monitor the effects of the ATOC sound on
humpback whales. These whales were considered especially sensitive
to the pitch of the ATOC sound, which has a rumbling frequency of
75 hertz (cycles per second). Humpback whales communicate using
sounds that low, but dolphins and many other animals can hear only
higher-pitch sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel and his colleagues reported the results of their
investigation in a recent issue of the Canadian Journal of Zoology.
</P>
<P>
   From a hill on the island off San Francisco the biologists
observed the surface behavior of the whales in 84 trials. In most
of them, the whales were exposed to sound from the ATOC loudspeaker
or engine noise from ships, while in others, for comparison, the
whales were exposed to no man-made noises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked for changes in swimming speeds and directions, and
other behavioral changes, including respiration,'' Frankel said.
Respiration rate can be measured by the intervals between blowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw no breaching or swimming in unison _ both indicators of
distress in whales,'' he said. But some changes in diving were
observed he said, particularly when the noise was coming from a
ship's engines. Exposure to sound seemed to be associated with
dives that were longer in duration and distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall,'' Frankel said, ``I wouldn't call the ATOC sound
benign, but its effects seem to be small _ perhaps an annoyance to
the animals rather than a hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rod Fujita, a marine biologist and spokesman for the
Environmental Defense Fund, one of the organizations that opposed
the ATOC program, said he was not convinced by the results that
Frankel reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't change my mind on the basis of a single
publication, and we have yet to hear from the advisory panel on
biology convened by ATOC,'' he said. ``The impacts of sound on
wildlife are subtle, and gauging them is somewhat subjective. While
ATOC would be helpful in calibrating models of climate change, it's
not the be-all and end-all of climate measurement. The important
thing is to take immediate steps to curb global warming.''
</P>
<P>
   If the ATOC program is to be ended anyway, does it matter that
many biologists now regard its sound pulses as harmless to
wildlife?
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is not moot,'' Frankel said. ``ATOC may be dead,
but the technique it developed and tested is very much alive. The
world still needs to know whether greenhouse warming and climate
change are occurring, and this is a useful indicator.'' &QL;

SOME OF SPACE'S OLD ALLURE IS REVIVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether it is the triumphant return of a true American Hero, one
small step for mankind's knowledge of the biological effects of
aging and spaceflight, or just a cynical political payoff, one
thing is clear: John Glenn's scheduled return to orbit this week
has prompted what may be an unprecedented round of reflection and
soul-searching about the past and future of the US space program
and of humanity's four-decade-old reach for the stars.
</P>
<P>
   And, to some extent, it has brought back a taste of the kind of
excitement and suspense that used to accompany every venture into
space.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the flight of the oldest person ever to leave the grip
of Earth's gravity signals the dawn of a new era in space, when
ordinary folks will soon be able to line up for a ticket to a realm
so far reserved for ``right stuff'' ex-military pilots, dedicated
space scientists, and the occasional legislator on a junket. But to
others, it is an illustration of just how badly the nation has
failed to progress in the nearly three decades since humans first
left their footprints on the moon's dusty landscape _ the
culmination of a hugely ambitious national quest that began with
Glenn's five hours in space.
</P>
<P>
   The return to orbit of the first American ever to reach that
pinnacle, in the same month that the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration is celebrating its 40th birthday, can't help but set
people to thinking back to that white-knuckled morning in 1962 _
and about how some things have changed, and others have failed to,
in the years since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-six years after sending John Glenn into orbit, NASA has
finally achieved the capability to send John Glenn into orbit,'' is
the cynical summation given by Rick Tumlinson, president of an
advocacy group called the Space Frontier Foundation that promotes
widespread access to space for ordinary people. ``NASA's decision
to fly him again shows that the government-run space program is
just going around in circles.''
</P>
<P>
   Buzz Aldrin, the second person ever to set his feet on lunar
soil _ just moments after Neil Armstrong's footprints were etched
indelibly into history _ agrees that the space program has been
suffering from the lack of any overriding, widely supported goal
and vision ever since President John F. Kennedy's objective of
landing on the moon and returning safely to Earth was achieved in
1969. But Aldrin thinks he knows what the space agency, the nation,
and the human race should be doing now on the frontier of space,
and he believes that most people would agree _ if only the
president, some president, would stand up as Kennedy did and
declare where the future lies.
</P>
<P>
   In a word, Mars. Aldrin, like most people who favor human
exploration of space, sees the red planet as the obvious next goal:
It is, after all, the only other world we know of that has some of
the key resources (water, oxygen, soil) to help sustain a human
settlement, and where permanent, self-sustaining colonies are
ultimately a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   After the Apollo buildup years when NASA consumed 4 percent of
the national budget, ``they thought it was going to continue that
way,'' Aldrin said _ and the agency's managers and supporters were
astonished and unprepared when President Richard M. Nixon pulled
the plug, calling off ambitious NASA plans for a space station and
a human landing on Mars by 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since then, the biggest excitement in the space program has
come mostly from the much less expensive robotic missions that have
been conducting a Lewis and Clark-like exploration of our
neighboring planets, gradually filling in the blanks on our solar
system maps. The human space program, meanwhile, has consisted of
nothing more than now-routine flights to low-Earth orbit to launch
commercial or military satellites or conduct scientific research.
Until Glenn's flight, most people weren't paying attention and the
television networks were seldom even broadcasting missions that
were, in essence, boldly going again where many have gone before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really critical that we look ahead now at where we want
to be in 20 years or so, so that doesn't happen again,'' Aldrin
said during a recent visit to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program is in transition,'' said John Logsdon, head of the
Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. ``It's not
heroic anymore. It may be interesting, but nobody's exploring new
frontiers or doing things for the first time. There's absolutely
nothing exciting about going around in circles.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is where we will be for years to come, Logsdon said.
``We have this thing to get through, called the International Space
Station,'' whose first component is to be launched aboard a Russian
rocket next month, and whose assembly is expected to consume the
time, cargo capacity, and efforts of most US and Russian piloted
missions for the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it will not be useful. Logsdon agrees that it is ``an
appropriate step,'' and most analysts feel that it will be a useful
laboaratory for learning about how humans respond to the long stays
in space that planetary exploration will require. But it is
certainly not the kind of project that will build Apollo-like
public excitement.
</P>
<P>
   That space station, costing well over $3 billion per year, ``has
to be up and operating before there can be any serious national
commitment to anything beyond it,'' Logsdon said. ``NASA has to
show the country, the leadership, the world that it can get through
this program.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are plenty of doubters. House Speaker Newt Gingrich
last month lambasted NASA's space station planning _ and, indeed,
the agency's entire operation _ although he stopped short of
calling for the station's cancellation. ``The space station now is
a mess,'' he said after NASA chief Daniel Goldin presented a
request for $660 million in extra funding, to help bail out the
cash-strapped Russians to ensure that their long-delayed but
crucial sections of the station will finally be delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than call for the agency to scale back its overall plans,
Gingrich suggested that NASA has not been ambitious enough. NASA
``has done a spectacular job of slowing down the rate in which
we've gotten into space,'' he said. If not for the ``cumbersome,
bureaucratic'' ways of the agency, he suggested, ``there is no
reason today we aren't permanently on the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear, though, that there is any public groundswell of
support for grander missions. Indeed, say many analysts, American
support for space exploration has been fairly tepid _ and
consistently so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The glass has been between half-full and half-empty all
along,'' said John Pike, a space policy analyst with the
Washington-based Federation of American Scientists. Polls have
consistently shown that only about half the public thought the
space program was worth the money _ except for a brief blip in July
of 1969, the month of the first moon landing, when those numbers
briefly went over 50 percent, but not by much, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recollection of it being wildly popular has more to do
with how the broadcast media was organized,'' Pike said. In those
days, if all three networks chose to show a launch, viewers had few
other choices. ``It seemed to be popular because Walter Cronkite
told us it was popular,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no denying the intensity of the popular
excitement that missions like Glenn's orbital flight and the first
moon landing generated. The astronauts were at least as popular and
celebrated in the 1960s as any movie or rock star is now, as the
ticker-tape parades and emotional throngs that greeted them
attested. The question that those who advocate a new era of
large-scale exploration ask is, can that level of excitement ever
happen again?

PRIVATE VENTURES HAVE SPACE-EXPLORATION IDEAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w/Glenn-Mission)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the 40 years since the founding of the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, the agency has stood as a synonym for
every civilian step that the United States would take in space. But
that could soon change.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen or so small companies, and a few big ones, hope to make
an end run around the space agency and usher in a new age of
privately funded, commercial ventures in space, including
everything from launching satellites to building tourist hotels in
orbit. Some even talk of privately funded human missions to other
planets.
</P>
<P>
   It is a drastic realignment of the way things happen in space _
and it may be an idea whose time has come. Even NASA administrator
Daniel Goldin has made it clear that he thinks the agency should
ultimately get out of the business of routine near-Earth missions,
and concentrate on far-reaching exploration and the development of
high-risk new technology that private companies could not _ or
would not _ manage.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the agency is funding two research projects aimed at
spurring commercial development of lower-cost launch vehicles: the
X-33 and X-34 projects. Both involve risky but potentially
significant technological leaps that might ultimately lead to
privately financed, totally reusable rockets.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the X-33, being built by Lockheed Martin, the
explicit goal is for NASA to fund only the initial, high-risk
technology development stage of the project, and then leave it up
to the company to decide whether to build the single-stage rocket
as a privately financed venture.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the aerospace business are skeptical that it will turn
out that way, noting that there have already been signs the company
will seek more government funding. But at the very least, the
project clearly demonstrates a new kind of thinking at NASA: having
the agency pay to develop the technology, then step out of the way
and let the private sector run the show.
</P>
<P>
   The Commercial Space Act, passed by Congress this month, also
calls for studying ways to let a significant portion of the
research capabilities of the International Space Station, scheduled
to be completed in 2003, be leased out for commercial projects. And
Goldin is also cautiously exploring doing the same with part of the
shuttle program, including the possibility of having one of the
four shuttle orbiters devoted to private, commercial operations.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the possibility of new rockets developed from scratch
with private money that some analysts see as the best hope for
dramatically lowering the costs of space flight, and thus opening
up space to widespread commercial development for tourism,
manufacturing, and Earth observations.
</P>
<P>
   Ten companies have already signed up to compete for an incentive
called the X-Prize, sponsored by the X-Prize Foundation, which is
offering $10 million to the first company that can send three
humans into space on a reusable rocket and then do it again within
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Some have even more ambitious ideas for free enterprise in
space. A new organization called the Mars Society hopes someday to
mount a privately financed robotic mission to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, if the US government does not appear ready to do so
soon enough, Mars Society president Robert Zubrin has said the
society might end up sending a privately financed mission of human
exploration to the red planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just imagine, if a private company had done Mars Pathfinder,
they would be in a position to raise billions of dollars for a
human mission,'' Zubrin said. ``I can't think of anything more
noble the human race could ever have attempted than to create a new
home for life.''

TURNING BALLOTS INTO JUNK MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Oregon was one of the first states to adopt the secret ballot.
Next month, if Phil Kiesling has his way, it may become the first
state to abolish it.
</P>
<P>
   Keisling is Oregon's secretary of state and an ardent proponent
of conducting elections by mail. Oregonians have been experimenting
with postal voting since the early 1980s, mostly for local and
special elections. But if Ballot Measure 60 is approved on Nov. 3,
(ital) all (unital) Oregon elections will henceforth be conducted
by mail. Ballot boxes and polling places will become things of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   So, for that matter, will Election Day. Statewide campaigns will
no longer end with an exclamation point as voters publicly come
together on a single climactic day to choose their representatives.
Instead they will fizzle out in an ellipsis. Voters will get
ballots in the mail weeks in advance and will send them back
whenever they feel like it. It will be, one critic of Measure 60
puts it, rather like having a judge announce that any juror may
vote and go home when he decides he's seen and heard enough of the
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The great advantage of vote-by-mail, proclaim its advocates, is
its convenience _ and as elections are made more convenient, voter
participation will rise. ``We all know,'' says Kiesling, ``that the
competing time constraints between work and family make it
difficult to find time to vote.... Vote-by-mail is an effective
solution for voters facing busy lives and longer ballots.''
</P>
<P>
   The director of Oregon Public Interest Research Group, a liberal
activist organization, agrees. ``With vote-by-mail,'' writes
Maureen Kirk, ``citizens will be able to vote without the barriers
of work schedules, child care, transportation, and other time or
lifestyle constraints.'' In the official voter guide distributed
statewide, James Sager of the Oregon Education Association ticks
off the problems Measure 60 would eliminate: ``No more juggling
your schedule. No worries about the weather. No questions about
polling location. No hassle.''
</P>
<P>
   Measure 60's opponents haven't been silent. They point out that
mail-only voting will make electoral fraud more likely. That it
encourages premature and impulse voting. That some ballots are
bound to get stolen or lost in the mail. That others will be sent
to voters who have died or moved _ or who have no interest in
voting. That mass-mailing ballots like supermarket circulars can
only trivialize elections. That it would do away with the integrity
of the secret voting booth, a reform Oregon adopted a century ago.
And that it eliminates one of the few remaining civic ceremonies by
which Americans reaffirm their democracy _ gathering at the polls
on the first Tuesday of every other November.
</P>
<P>
   But if opinion surveys are right, voters aren't listening.
Measure 60 is widely supported. With their appeal to self-interest
_ the convenience of voting at home _ and public interest _ the
promise of higher voter turnout _ Kiesling &AMP; Co. have hit on a
seemingly unbeatable pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a shame.
</P>
<P>
   No question about it, mail-in elections makes voting so easy
that even uninterested slackers may be induced to cast a ballot.
But why is that a good thing? Why should citizens who take voting
seriously want their franchise diluted by the votes of citizens who
(ital) don't (unital) take voting seriously?
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to say that democracy should not be encumbered
by poll taxes, property requirements, or discrimination on the
basis of gender. It is something else entirely to say that if
people can't bestir themselves to get to a ballot box once every
two years, the ballot box should be brought to them.
</P>
<P>
   After all, voting is not a Herculean challenge. You go to the
polling place, you wait in line, you step behind the curtain, you
mark your choices. Someone for whom that is too much to bother with
is someone who shouldn't be voting in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they have to get the kids to bed, struggle with bad
weather, and do their hour commute to work,'' Richard Hanson,
Oregon's assistant secretary of state, has said, ``the last thing
they are going to want to do is go to the polls.'' The reason for
low voter turnout is ``not that people are out of touch, it's that
the system is not meeting their needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense. Low voter turnout is caused by ignorance, apathy, and
selfishness and by a disdain for politics and politicians. Voters
who find it logistically difficult to get to the polls _ because of
illness, age, or a punishing schedule _ have the easy option of
requesting an absentee ballot. With a few exceptions, Americans who
don't vote don't want to vote. Fine. It's a free country. The rest
of us ought to be grateful that public policy isn't being made by
people who treat their voting rights with such disrespect.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon was a pioneer in the empowerment of voters. It was in the
forefront of the movement for women's suffrage, for electing US
senators by popular vote, and for enabling citizens to enact and
repeal laws by initiative and referendum. Measure 60 will degrade
that record. Dumbing down elections does not make them more
meaningful. Turning ballots into junk mail does not make citizens
take them more seriously. If Oregonians pass Measure 60, they will
have succeeded only in making their own votes worth less.

 &HT;    Internet provides guide for ghouls
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is difficult to write about Halloween sites on the
World Wide Web without using any puns. But don't be spooked.
There's not a ghost of a chance you'll be left with haunting
memories of bad jokes here.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start our tour of the frightful sites with one called
Halloween at http://www.4halloween.com/ that can furnish all the
necessities for a traditional Halloween. You will, of course, want
to copy the recipe here for fake blood and follow some of the links
to the traditional scary stories that should be told on this
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also get hints here for making (or buying) a trick or
treat costume. And don't leave this site without reading up on the
various methods of carving a jack-o'-lantern pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've mastered that art _ and assuming you still have the
usual number of fingers left so you can operate the computer
keyboard _ let's move to Jody's Haunted Halloween Page at
http://www.netwide.net/users/lightner/halloween.html. Even if you
are unmoved by the most lifeless zombie and do not have a burning
desire to dress as a witch, you may enjoy this page.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there are recipes with a Halloween theme. You can,
for instance, prepare Tuna Spooks, or Bloody Devil Dogs, or
Gingerbread Ghosts with a little help from the recipes you find.
Or, if you lean more toward conventional fare, you'll find a good
recipe that will let you use the remains of your jack-o'-lantern to
cook up some pumpkin bread.
</P>
<P>
   But there's still more. You will find links to many other pages
with a Halloween theme as well as recommendations and designs for
trick-or-treat costumes. You'll also get some safety tips that help
make your own ghosts and goblins stand out in the dark to avoid
traffic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Halloween wouldn't feel right without a trip to a haunted house.
You'll probably find several near where you live, tours of the
awful with the admission price going to a charity.
</P>
<P>
   But if you'd like to take a tour of a virtual haunted house,
complete with sound effects and music, wander over to The Haunted
House at
http://members.aol.com/harley101/private/hween/hween1.html. You'll
also find a selection of Halloween sound files you can download.
</P>
<P>
   Next we'll stop in at a place that will give you ideas for
Halloween costumes. It's a page called Halloween and is sponsored
by McCall's Patterns. It's way too late to order the patterns from
this page at http://www.mccall.com/funstuff.html but the full color
photographs will spark some good ideas if you're planning to make
your costume this year.
</P>
<P>
   We've saved the sweetest of the sites for last. It's Hershey's
Halloween 1998 at http://www.hersheys.com/(tilde)hershey
</P>
<P>
   /halloween/. Since the site is sponsored by the famous chocolate
maker, as you would expect, there is some commercial content here.
However, as you might not expect, most of the page is used for
nifty Halloween screensavers you can download, a Halloween Handbook
that offers everything from safety tips to costume ideas, and a
really nifty feature called a Pumpkin Carving Planner.
</P>
<P>
   To use the planner, simply move the jigsaw puzzle like pieces
around. The notion is to try out various designs for a carved
pumpkin before you make the first cut. Even if you never carve a
jack-o'-lantern yourself, it's a lot of fun to use the designer.

 &HT;    Action Files carries on tradition
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the early days of Apple Computer, Now Utilities was
among the most successful and innovative enhancers of the software
that gave the Mac its distinct look and feel.
</P>
<P>
   Now Utilities was so successful Apple Computer added many of its
innovations to the Mac operating system. Things such as
point-and-click navigation through folders, hierarchical pop-up
menus and lists of recently used files and folders began with Now
Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere in the mid-1990s Now Utilities lost its way. It
failed to come up with new innovations and has not released a
version compatible with OS 8.
</P>
<P>
   The company was sold a couple of times and finally ended up in
the hands of a hot new upstart, Power On Software. Power On is
updating Now Utilities and incorporating it into its own popular
Action Files Software.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Action Files is the modern day successor to Now in
both function and spirit. It's a simple but powerful enhancement to
the Mac's open and save dialogue box.
</P>
<P>
   That's the window that pops up anytime you highlight and release
the open command in any menu. It lists files by name and lets you
navigate through a file or folder to a particular item.
</P>
<P>
   Action Files, like Now's SuperBoomerang utility, greatly
enhances this window. For starters, it adds a menu bar with lots of
new headings along the top. Those headings include not only a
file's name but also the size, kind, label and modification date.
</P>
<P>
   You can also sort files in this window, turn off column headings
and resize an Action File's window, something you can't do in the
Mac OS.
</P>
<P>
   But the best part of Action Files is its navigational tools. It
lets you save in a list your favorite files and folders. Just
highlight the item you want to add to your favorites list and hit
the space bar.
</P>
<P>
   The item now appears every time under either the document or
folder heading in the menu bar. To jump to any particular item,
just highlight it in the menu. This is a great timesaver.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find Action Files all over the Internet, from which a
trial copy can be downloaded. Among the sites are http://www
</P>
<P>
   .actionutilities.com and http://www5.zdnet.com/mac, the Mac
homepage of ZDNet.
</P>
<P>
   The price of Action Files is $39.95 for a downloaded version and
$49.95 for a CD version.

 &HT;    Pathfinder splits off its magazine content
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pathfinder, (http://www.pathfinder.com), Time Warner's catch-all
content site that includes all its major magazine and media
properties was one of the first corporate sites to hit the Web.
Users logging on in 1995 were fascinated to find Time magazine
available on their computers. Pathfinder, along with HotWired, were
two of the Web's coolest destinations in the early days.
</P>
<P>
   But that was yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years the clunky, cluttered Pathfinder home base has
been attacked for its long download time _ users complained they
could read all of Time, half of Sports Illustrated and
Entertainment Weekly's movie reviews offline in the time it took
for Pathfinder to load. As Pathfinder lurched from one redesign to
another adding more and more content, analysts questioned the
wisdom of stacking the world's most famous magazine brands and
cable companies behind the Pathfinder Web address. Internally,
staffers struggled to develop sites that reflected each magazine's
unique style and still give Pathfinder some sense of uniformity.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, it was an uphill battle. Time Warner got tired of
fighting. In the early days, when the Web was a largely untried and
untested medium and access to it was largely by 2400 bps modems,
one-stop destinations like Pathfinder and Wired made a lot of
sense. They were fun, graphic and were perfect for the first wave
of Web surfers, fascinated more by the medium than the message.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Web evolved from an underground hobby into big
business targeting mass audiences, companies with an eye on the
bottom line began to see that promoting established brands rather
than unique hangouts was the key to online success.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, Time Warner began to break up the Pathfinder family
with the announcement that the online edition of ``People''
magazine will move off the Web and be available exclusively on
America Online. The company also said that its other popular online
brands including Entertainment Weekly, ParentTime, Money.com and
Time.com will also be available via AOL.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling here is what's the point in hiding our crown
jewels under a bushel,'' says Time Warner spokesman Graham Cannon.
``Our job in a very dynamic online environment is delivering the
kind of information people want where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   People.com's 18-month deal with AOL is an effort to find a place
where People's offline readers congregate. AOL's strong female and
family demographics make it an ideal location for the breathless
celebrity news and gossip People is famous for. Cannon says that
more than one-third of AOL's 20 million members are already People
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of content aggregators like Pathfinder are over,'' he
says. ``Pathfinder as a consumer brand is not the way I see our
users using our sites.'' Time Warner research reveals that less
than 2 percent of Time Warner's Web site traffic comes through the
Pathfinder Web address. In an age of increasing Web
commercialization, users are much more likely to type in
``time.com'' or ``EntertainmentWeekly.com.''
</P>
<P>
   The decentralization of Pathfinder, like the sale of Wired,
another early Web hangout, is a sign the Web is growing up. While
surfing the Web is still fun, the new generation of online users
want their Web sites served up quickly and their news updated
regularly from name brand products they can access by just typing
in its name. It may not be hip, but it is the future.
</P>
<P>
   Wallpapers.Com: Is there a more infernal exercise than shopping
for wallpaper (other than putting up the hated material, of course
...)? This site helps you wallpaper the background of your
computer's operating system, offering free desktop themes and
e-mail postcards for both PC and Mac, plus holiday screensavers.

 &HT;    Searching best search engines
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's already impressive, but what will make the
Internet a truly amazing tool is a simple way to access its
resources.
</P>
<P>
   We aren't there yet. The main access route, search engines,
speak a different language than you do and, when put to work, turn
up thousands of useless pages to search.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, we have to learn to better use what we have.
Yahoo! Internet Life, in its November issue, helps by breaking
search topics into different categories and listing what they think
is the best engine for each.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Light, http://www.northernlight.com, is listed as the
most useful search engine. The site uses search folders that
organize your search results into categories.
</P>
<P>
   It listed its own engine, Yahoo!, http://www.yahoo.com, as the
best search directory. The site was praised for categorization, a
user-friendly interface and customizable news content.
</P>
<P>
   Deja News, http://www.dejanews.com, is considered the best way
to search for newsgroup postings.
</P>
<P>
   FindMail, http://www.findmail.com, got the nod for best mailing
list search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves for Kids, http://www.ajkids.com, was the most
kid-friendly search engine. It has a feature that lets you filter
what your kids search for. Shareware Search Engine,
http://www.hotfiles.com, is a Ziff-Davis shareware directory with
downloads and reviews. For those who just want to hone their
searching capabilities, Search Engine Resource,
http://www.searchenginewatch.com, might be the place. This site
includes a tutorial that helps you refine your searches. The site
also keeps a list of search-engine links.
</P>
<P>
   Thin is good and now it's cheaper
</P>
<P>
   Sharp is releasing a new generation of Windows CE-based portable
PCs that are thinner, lighter and below $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharp Mobilon Pro has a large, full-VGA 8.2-inch color
touch-screen and keyboard. The unit weighs 2.7 pounds and is 1-inch
thin.
</P>
<P>
   The Mobilon Pro retails for a suggested $899.
</P>
<P>
   The unit was designed with mobile professionals and college
students in mind. It has an ``instant on'' Windows CE feature that
cuts boot-up time. The system allows the option of keyboard data
entry or touch-screen.
</P>
<P>
   The TV for the couch potato
</P>
<P>
   In plenty of time for the holidays, Pioneer Electronics is
coming out with some high-end in-home entertainment options.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer offers the PRO-100 projection television. It has a
51-inch screen with 1,000 lines of horizontal image resolution.
That's $4.30 a line, as estimated retail is $4,300.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you fortunate enough to be trying to choose between
a nice, newly used BMW and television monitor, Pioneer's
High-Definition Television Ready 50-inch Plasma Display might be up
your alley.
</P>
<P>
   The 3.86-inch-deep screen weighs 92 pounds and has a maximum
resolution of 1280x768 XGA and more than 980,000 pixels. Suggested
retail: $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the shopping list, closer to the average person's
limit, is the PDR-555RW Compact Disc Recorder. The $699 machine
uses standard CDR audio discs that you can record on and the new
CD-RW format, which lets you record up to 74 minutes worth. The
discs are erasable. A feature called Digital Synchro takes the
shaky-hand factor out of the process. With Digital Synchro, the
start and finish of the playback track is recognized and
automatically synchronized with the recorder.
</P>
<P>
   The Pioneer Mini Disc Recorder, the MJ-D707, also uses Digital
Synchro. The system features 20-bit A/D and D/A converters and an
automatic threshold control circuit that restores incoming digital
signals to their original form. The mini-disc recorder retails for
an estimated $399.
</P>
<P>
   First, they came up with the 10-disc changer and that seemed a
bit excessive. Then came the 25-disc and the 100-disc.
</P>
<P>
   Behold the 301-disc changer.
</P>
<P>
   The PD-F1007 Giga CD Changer is designed to load and play CDs in
the center of a roulette rack, so it is not any bigger than any
other stereo components.
</P>
<P>
   The unit retails for $349 and comes with 10 custom filing modes,
a 50-track best selection memory, an optical digital output, CD
text, CD title input. And, in case 301 CDs won't cut it, it has the
ability to attach a second unit, which lets the system hold more
than 600 CDs.

 &HT;    It's time for that once-a-year physical
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   October is National Car Care Month. The shorter days, colder
weather, wet streets and new state emissions test for older
vehicles all come this month.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, we began to get your vehicle ready for the upcoming
season by checking the systems inside the car. This week, it's time
to look on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Take your checklist _ the one with the ``good,'' ``bad'' and
``get repaired'' column and a space for a check mark or comment.
Assign everyone a task, and let's go.
</P>
<P>
   It is best to check power mirrors, power windows, power seat and
power door lock operation while the engine is still running so it
won't draw the extra electricity from the battery. Regular mirrors,
locks, windows and seats can be checked with the engine off. Make
note of any weird noises, binding or sticking. Don't forget to
check all of the seat belts (a good job for little kids).
</P>
<P>
   Time for tires. Write L/F (for left front), R/F, L/R, R/R and
Spare on your list. Check the spare first. Make sure it is inflated
to the pressure stamped on the side of the tire.
</P>
<P>
   Check your jack, making sure all of the parts are with it and
that it works correctly. If it is at all rusted or binds, lubricate
it with some spray oil.
</P>
<P>
   Now, take a look at each ``on the ground'' tire. If the tire is
wearing evenly, all of the little lines and crevices across the
tread should look about the same.
</P>
<P>
   If there is more wear on both outer edges of each tire or if the
edges are good but the middle of the tread is worn, you need to
adjust the tire pressure. If the tire is only wearing on one side
or in spots, put a check mark in the ``get repaired'' column.
</P>
<P>
   After you inspect each tire, compare them with each other. Do
all of the tread designs (lines and crevices) have the same general
pattern? Look at the sides of the tires. Are they all made by the
same company? The two front tires should match each other in tread
design and size, as should the two rears. The front and the rears
don't have to match as long as you keep them together when you
rotate them.
</P>
<P>
   The only time I've seen a problem with different fronts and
rears is on four-wheel-drive vehicles. Mixed-up tire sizes and
tread designs can cause steering, handling and braking problems
that get worse in bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   As a tire wears, the diameter of the tire gets smaller, which is
why tires should always be replaced in pairs and mounted on either
the front or rear at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, the best brakes in the world won't stop a set of
bad tires.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to brakes. Take advantage of this mild autumn
weather and go for a ride with the windows down. Listen for any
noises coming from the wheels both when the vehicle is rolling and
when you apply the brakes. Do you feel any vibration in the brake
pedal or the steering wheel when you step on the pedal? Does the
vehicle pull right or left when you brake? Does the emergency
(parking) brake keep the vehicle from rolling when you use it?
</P>
<P>
   How does your checklist look? Even if everything looks pretty
good, I suggest making an appointment with your car doctor and
getting the other incidentals such as the battery, fluids, belts
and hoses checked.
</P>
<P>
   A once-a-year physical for your vehicle sets a good example to
the future drivers in your family.
</P>
<P>
   The Car Care Council says 5.2 percent of accidents are caused by
vehicle neglect. This is not a figure I want to be a part of.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki is on the verge of one of the
largest landslide victories in New York election history.
</P>
<P>
   And his two fellow incumbents in statewide office _ Comptroller
H. Carl McCall and Attorney General Dennis Vacco _ seem headed for
re-election as well, according to the Albany Times Union/Syracuse
Newspapers poll conducted Oct. 20 and 21. The Zogby International
polling firm surveyed 703 people who said they're likely to vote in
the Nov. 3 election. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8
percentage points.

   According to the polls, Pataki leads Democratic challenger Peter
Vallone 54 percent to 21 percent. Independence Party candidate B.
Thomas Golisano is backed by 7 percent of those polled.
</P>
<P>
   An even larger number _ 56 percent _ said they think Pataki
deserves to be re-elected. One-third of those polled said it's time
for someone new to be governor.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only question left to be answered in next Tuesday's
election is whether Pataki can break the record for the largest
victory _ set in 1986 by the man he ran out of office four years
ago: Mario Cuomo. In 1986 Cuomo received 65 percent of the vote in
defeating Republican Andrew O'Rourke. No other candidate this
century has received as much as 60 percent of the vote in a New
York governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the governor's race is such a foregone
conclusion, pollster John Zogby noted, that ``the real stories here
... are that Golisano appears to be climbing and (Lt. Gov. Betsy)
McCaughey-Ross is slowly fading.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaughey-Ross, who switched from the Republican to the
Democratic party but lost the primary to New York City Council
Speaker Vallone, is the Liberal Party candidate. Only 2 percent of
those polled said they would vote for her.
</P>
<P>
   The depth of Pataki's support shows up in almost every sub-group
of the poll. He leads upstate 58 percent to 8 percent for Vallone.
In fact, Golisano is doing better upstate than Vallone, carrying 15
percent of voters. In the New York City suburbs, Pataki leads
Vallone 58 percent to 22 percent. Even in heavily Democratic New
York City, Pataki leads 43 percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among all Democrats statewide, Vallone leads Pataki by just 10
percentage points, 41 percent to 31 percent. The only other
segments of the population among which Vallone leads are blacks and
Hispanics. There's no gender gap in this race: Pataki leads among
men 57 percent to 21 percent and among women 51 percent to 21
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The most competitive of the three statewide races is for
attorney general. Vacco, a Republican, holds an 11-percentage-point
lead over Democrat Eliot Spitzer. His margin is up from last month,
when he led the former assistant Manhattan district attorney by 6
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco, a Buffalo native, holds an overwhelming lead among
upstate voters. Nearly half (48 percent) of those polled upstate
back Vacco, versus just 17 percent for Spitzer. The race is much
closer downstate, with Vacco up 37 percent to 30 percent in the New
York City suburbs and Spitzer leading 41 percent to 27 percent in
New York City. The attorney general has a sizable lead among men
(44 percent to 26 percent), while women are almost evenly split (33
percent for Vacco, 30 percent for Spitzer).
</P>
<P>
   McCall, the only Democrat holding statewide office, is also
cruising to another term as comptroller, according to the poll. He
leads Republican Bruce Blakeman by a margin of 52 percent to 19
percent. An equal percentage said they think McCall deserves to be
re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   McCall holds at least a 2-1 margin in every region of the state
and among every demographic group.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki is on the verge of one of the
largest landslide victories in New York election history.
</P>
<P>
   And his two fellow incumbents in statewide office _ Comptroller
H. Carl McCall and Attorney General Dennis Vacco _ seem headed for
re-election as well, according to the Albany Times Union/Syracuse
Newspapers poll conducted Oct. 20 and 21. The Zogby International
polling firm surveyed 703 people who said they're likely to vote in
the Nov. 3 election. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8
percentage points.

THE GOOD AND BAD NEWS ON CONOCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The largest initial public offering in the United States went
off without a hitch Wednesday, as institutional and small investors
snapped up more than 190 million shares of Conoco, the nation's
eighth largest oil company. Demand for Conoco shares was so strong
that its corporate parent, DuPont, ended up selling 30 percent of
the company and raising $4.4 billion. Those dollars will help
DuPont transform itself for the coming genomics revolution.
Conoco's initial public offering provides insight into an
approaching sea change in the oil business.
</P>
<P>
   The private-to-public market has been as dead as a smelt since
the collapse one month ago of the high-flying hedge fund Long Term
Capital. Even Goldman Sachs, the nation's most formidable
investment banking firm, canceled its offering in the wake of Long
Term Capital's demise. If Goldman Sachs couldn't be brought to
market, investors asked, what could be?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, it turned out, was Conoco, an oil company with an
impressive track record of earnings (even in these times of lower
crude oil prices) and an attractive dividend of 76 cents a share
(3.3 percent based on the offering price of $23 per share). Conoco
is the kind of stock that mutual fund managers can load up on and
still sleep peacefully through the night.
</P>
<P>
   But the larger story about the success of the offering is more
chilling. It is based upon a study published in Scientific American
last March, which was based on a working paper presented to the
International Energy Agency one year ago. Both documents were
written by Colin Campbell and Jean Laherrere, senior partners in
Petroconsultants, a geological consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, these two men have more than 40 years of
experience as senior geologists to such international oil giants as
Total, Amoco, and Texaco. Both are highly regarded for their
expertise and their sober analysis of geological realities.
Hysterics, they are not. Here's what they wrote in Scientific
American:
</P>
<P>
   ``The next oil crunch will not be so temporary. Our analysis of
the discovery and production of oil fields around the world
suggests that within the next decade, the supply of conventional
oil will be unable to keep up with demand. This conclusion
contradicts the picture one gets from oil industry reports, which
boasted of 1,020 billion barrels of oil (BBO) in proved reserves at
the start of 1998. Dividing that figure by the current production
rate of about 23.6 BBO a year might suggest that crude oil could
remain plentiful and cheap for 43 more years probably longer,
because official charts show reserves growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, this appraisal makes three critical errors.
First, it relies on distorted estimates of reserves. A second
mistake is to pretend that production will remain constant. Third
and most important, conventional wisdom erroneously assumes that
the last bucket of oil can be pumped from the ground just as
quickly as the barrel of oil gushing from wells today. In fact, the
rate at which any well or any country can produce oil always rises
to a maximum and then, when about half the oil is gone, begins
falling gradually back to zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an economic perspective, when the world runs completely
out of oil is thus not directly relevant; what matters is when
production begins to taper off. Beyond that point, prices will rise
unless demand declines commensurately. Using several different
techniques to estimate the current reserves of conventional oil and
the amount still left to be discovered, we conclude that the
decline will begin before 2010.''
</P>
<P>
   Global demand for oil is expected to double in the next 30
years. Since 1990, according to Barrons, consumption of oil
products has jumped by 50 percent in Asia and by one third in Latin
America. A long report in The New York Times Thursday made clear
that American thirst for oil products shows no signs of abating.
``Commensurate'' decline in world demand for oil is not going to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that oil price increases are almost certainly just
around the corner. Some oil company executives are almost alarmist
about the coming oil crunch. James Srodes, writing in last week's
Barrons, notes that Franco Bernabe, chief executive of a major
Italian oil company, has given ``a series of interviews in which he
moved the doomsday clock forward to between 2000 and 2005. He
forecast that today's world oil price would soon begin to rise from
its $15 base and quickly pass the $30 mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Global economic development is heavily dependent on cheap oil.
Oil accounts for 38 percent of all energy used, according to
Srodes, and ``a barrel of oil routinely offers 10 or more times raw
power for our activities than it takes to get it, conferring an
enormous profit not only on the companies that supply oil but on
the entire economy.'' Without cheap oil, economic activity recedes.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies are rapidly consolidating in advance of the coming
oil crunch. They've read the Campbell-Herrere analysis and they do
not disagree. British Petroleum recently acquired Amoco, and other
``majors'' are actively looking for acquisition targets. Conoco, in
all likelihood, will be one of those targets. That's good news for
all those new Conoco shareholders; alarming news for the rest of
us.

 &HT;    Reboot your life _ give away your old computer
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Computers can figure your taxes, connect you to the
Web so you find a good place to board your dog for the weekend, let
you pass a slow Saturday killing space aliens, and make your
spelling resemble English more when you write your Aunt Vera Mae.
</P>
<P>
   But the best thing a person can do with a computer is give it
away.
</P>
<P>
   Now that prices are so low and new computers are so powerful
compared to last year's model, many people will be buying a new
machine. Today, I'm suggesting a fine use for the old machine. Put
it in the hands of someone who needs a computer but can't afford
one.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way to write a column like this without being corny
and sentimental. But some of the world's greatest moments are corny
ones. If you've gone a week or so without blushing, then maybe I
can help you find a way to reboot your life.
</P>
<P>
   When most people think about giving a computer away, the
practical side takes over. Before you know it, you are considering
IRS rules and tax-deductible ways to use that donation to shave a
tax bill. If that approach appeals to you, then there are plenty of
excellent organizations that could use that old clunker of yours. I
can even recommend a place here in Atlanta called Freebytes that
will even take in defective computers (it's also delighted to have
working models).
</P>
<P>
   It qualifies as a tax-deductible charity and has a Web site at
http://www.freebytes.org that will give you all the details. Even
if you live far away from Atlanta, the Web site can be valuable
since it has links to similar organizations in other areas. There's
nothing wrong with saving on your taxes and helping someone else at
the same time. That's real multitasking.
</P>
<P>
   But some of you may believe charity begins at home. And plenty
of my old machines have found places within my own family _
extended and otherwise. There's even an old 8088 machine _ if it
was a car it would qualify for antique plates _ that's happily
writing letters in Jonesboro, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of opportunities in most families. Maybe your
parents aren't properly wired. Think of the money you'll save on
phone bills if Mom and Dad can use e-mail to keep in touch and _
with a computer _ you'll be able to send them e-mails with
electronic images of the latest family happenings. Or perhaps there
is a niece or nephew that could use a computer.
</P>
<P>
   All these are fine uses for an old computer. But none of them
have the true blush value of giving a computer away to a total
stranger. If you really want to stammer and blush, think about
using your computer to change the life of a school kid.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, being able to log on to the Internet to get homework
help; or to simply fire up a computer to write a school report, is
almost as important for a kid as having access to books. But a lot
of families have enough trouble buying groceries. While computer
prices are lower than ever, even one of those $600 PCs that seem so
inexpensive to you represent a financial mountain for others.
</P>
<P>
   Most schools and churches can help you find a kid who needs a
computer. Or your own children may have a nomination to make. And,
if you have time, set up the computer and even give an hour or so
of instruction.
</P>
<P>
   If you take this route, you won't get a penny's worth of
deduction on your taxes. But my guess is it'll make you richer than
you ever dreamed possible. And your computer will have performed
one last fine task for you _ it may make you blush.

PROMISES OF KYOTO ARE FALTERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's amazing what a little food and sleep deprivation can
accomplish. Working through the night without stopping for meals,
negotiators from industrialized nations unexpectedly reached a
historic agreement in Kyoto, Japan, last year to cut releases of
the gases that may be causing the planet to warm up.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven months later, as diplomats prepare to meet next week in
Buenos Aires to hammer out details, astonishment at last year's
``miracle'' has given way to fear that the Kyoto Protocol could
turn into so much ``hot air'' as countries look for ways to comply
without making unpopular changes at home.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, the world's largest source of so-called
``greenhouse gases,'' has indicated it would prefer to pay other
countries to reduce emissions from their vehicles and power plants,
rather than deeply cutting emissions here. In practice, worry
environmentalists, that could mean paying East European countries
to take advantage of pollution reductions caused by economic
collapse, instead of confronting the real problem.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, developing nations are fighting US pressure to cut
their fast-growing greenhouse emissions right away. Affluent
countries caused the problem, they argue, so affluent countries
should take the first steps &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   All the maneuvering, during what will likely go down as the
hottest year in weather history, worries some environmentalists,
who fear that the need to avert a predicted rise in the Earth's
temperature over the next century could get lost in the shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we doing more than rearranging some deck chairs here? Are
we starting to turn the ship away fom the iceberg or not?'' asks
Christopher Flavin, senior vice president of the Worldwatch
Institute, an environmental think &UR;  &LR; tank in Washington D.C. ``We
could be watching the very quiet death of an agreement that people
thought was a historic agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   While diplomats debate, however, some countries are making
measurable progress &UR; . &LR;  Denmark now gets a world record 3.5 percent
of its electricity from wind turbines, allowing Danes to burn less
oil and coal. But tiny Denmark's impact on the world's problem is
negligible.
</P>
<P>
   And the new government of Germany, a coalition of the Social
Democrats and the environmentalist Green Party, ha &UR; s &LR;  already
announced plans for tough new taxes on fuels that release carbon
dioxide &UR; . &LR;  The government is also pushing wind and solar power &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to deliver more than the Clinton Administration has
done,'' said Sascha Mueller-Kraenner of the Heinrich Boll
Foundation, a non-profit group allied with the Green Party. &UR; if,,2 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton Administration officials say it's wrong to write off
US leadership on climate change. This month, Clinton won a 26
percent increase in funding for global warming research and extra
money for clean energy projects from a Congress that is openly
skeptical of global warming theory.
</P>
<P>
   David Sandalow of the White House Council on Environmental
Quality argues that the public needs to be patient while
governments try to agree on the difficult mechanics of reducing
emissions produced by fundamental parts of their economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most complex set of international negotiations
ever and we shouldn't expect too much without losing our sense of
urgency,'' said Sandalow. ``The negotiations have not bogged down;
they've barely happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting in Buenos Aires comes during record global heat. The
global temperature this year, through September, is 1.25 degrees
Fahrenheit above the average for the preceding 118 years, putting
1998 on track to be the warmest year ever. &UR;  &LR; In addition, some
ecological systems are showing signs of heat stress, including
unprecedented bleaching of tropical coral reefs due to warm surface
waters, and mountain glaciers that are melting at a record pace.
</P>
<P>
   But trends in global climate are difficult to judge even with a
century of weather records. Fifteen thousand years ago, the world
was deep in an ice age, so, in a sense, global warming has gone on
for a long time. As a result, it's hard for scientists to say for
sure whether human releases of heat-trapping gases are causing this
century's warming trend.
</P>
<P>
   In a very real sense, the world's response to the warming trend
hinges on the actions of the United States, which releases more
than twice as much carbon dioxide as the next industrial nation.
The United Nations official overseeing the climate treaty, Michael
Zammit Cutajar, has said flatly that the treaty won't go into
effect unless the US Senate ratifies it.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States presents a split personality to the world.
On one hand, Vice President Al Gore wrote a book on global warming,
and he played a key role in brokering the Kyoto agreement. ``I
think we can improve our lifestyles and have higher standards of
living'' by adopting technologies that reduce emissions, Gore has
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the treaty must be ratified by the
Republican-controlled Senate, where skepticism over global warming
runs high and 27 members haven't voted the way environmentalists
wanted on any issue in at least two years. Republicans charge that
reducing greenhouse gases will seriously damage the coal, oil, and
auto industries, for dubious benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Senators passed a resolution saying they wouldn't ratify the
Convention on Climate Change, of which the Kyoto Protocol is a
part, unless all countries sacrifice. They demanded ``meaningful
participation'' from developing nations such as China and India,
sparking a row that will continue in Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   For US firms that want to build the cleaner cars, power plants,
and factories that would reduce American consumption of coal and
oil, the unresolved conflict has translated into confusion.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Clinton Administraiton came to Minnesota last
month to celebrate the opening of the nation's largest wind farm.
But, last week, Republican budget writers dropped a key tax break
for the industry, prompting developers of another big wind farm in
Texas to reconsider whether to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Kasten, president of New York-based Trigen Corp., said
the bickering puts up road blocks to easy opportunities to reduce
consumption of fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a veritable orchard of low-hanging fruit that is
economic to go pick except that it's surrounded by barbed wire,''
said Casten, whose company cuts emissions by increasing the heat
efficiency of power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the government's split personality mirrors the public's.
Surveys show broad public support for protecting the environment;
79 percent favor a treaty to reduce greenhouse gases, according to
a new poll done for the World Wildlife Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans show little appetite for sacrifice, instead buying
sport utility vehicles that get low gas mileage and using ever more
energy-consuming devices, from video games to computers. The Energy
Information Agency estimates that Americans have erased the energy
conservation gains of the 1970s Energy Crisis &UR; , &LR;  when oil prices
sky-rocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with these realities, the Clinton Administration has
delayed asking the Senate to ratify the Convention on Climate
Change, of which the Kyoto Protocol is a part, while trying to come
up with a cheap way to meet emissions reductions goals.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, the Administration has satisfied neither the
skeptics nor the environmentalists. When Council of Economic
Advisors Chairwoman Janet Yellen told Congress that the United
States could cut greenhouse emissions by 7 percent for just $70 to
$100 per household, both sides complained.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics assailed the cost estimates as unrealistically low,
especially considering that the US emissions are still rising.
Already, the nation is 13 percent above the 1990 emissions level
that is the baseline for the Kyoto Protocol.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists were just as concerned about Yellen's
estimates because they were based on the assumption that most US
reductions would happen in other countries, rather than here. The
Kyoto Protocol allows countries to meet the emissions goals by
purchasing ``emissions credits'' from countries whose emissions are
below the Kyoto targets.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the two countries that have been most successful
in exceeding the Kyoto goals, Russia and the Ukraine, have done so
as a result of economic collapse, not clean energy sources or
conservation. If the United States buys emissions credits from
these two countries, it would be benefitting from another country's
misfortune rather than tackling its own problems.
</P>
<P>
   How much the United States will be able to rely on other
countries to help it comply with the Kyoto deal depends very much
on what happens in the Buenos Aires talks. European nations are
pushing for strict limits on selling ``emissions credits,'' while
the US wants a more free-wheeling system that would include at
least some developing countrie.

 &HT;    Reboot your life _ give away your old computer
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Computers can figure your taxes, connect you to the
Web so you find a good place to board your dog for the weekend, let
you pass a slow Saturday killing space aliens, and make your
spelling resemble English more when you write your Aunt Vera Mae.
</P>
<P>
   But the best thing a person can do with a computer is give it
away.
</P>
<P>
   Now that prices are so low and new computers are so powerful
compared to last year's model, many people will be buying a new
machine. Today, I'm suggesting a fine use for the old machine. Put
it in the hands of someone who needs a computer but can't afford
one.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way to write a column like this without being corny
and sentimental. But some of the world's greatest moments are corny
ones. If you've gone a week or so without blushing, then maybe I
can help you find a way to reboot your life.
</P>
<P>
   When most people think about giving a computer away, the
practical side takes over. Before you know it, you are considering
IRS rules and tax-deductible ways to use that donation to shave a
tax bill. If that approach appeals to you, then there are plenty of
excellent organizations that could use that old clunker of yours. I
can even recommend a place here in Atlanta called Freebytes that
will even take in defective computers (it's also delighted to have
working models).
</P>
<P>
   It qualifies as a tax-deductible charity and has a Web site at
http://www.freebytes.org that will give you all the details. Even
if you live far away from Atlanta, the Web site can be valuable
since it has links to similar organizations in other areas. There's
nothing wrong with saving on your taxes and helping someone else at
the same time. That's real multitasking.
</P>
<P>
   But some of you may believe charity begins at home. And plenty
of my old machines have found places within my own family _
extended and otherwise. There's even an old 8088 machine _ if it
was a car it would qualify for antique plates _ that's happily
writing letters in Jonesboro, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of opportunities in most families. Maybe your
parents aren't properly wired. Think of the money you'll save on
phone bills if Mom and Dad can use e-mail to keep in touch and _
with a computer _ you'll be able to send them e-mails with
electronic images of the latest family happenings. Or perhaps there
is a niece or nephew that could use a computer.
</P>
<P>
   All these are fine uses for an old computer. But none of them
have the true blush value of giving a computer away to a total
stranger. If you really want to stammer and blush, think about
using your computer to change the life of a school kid.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, being able to log on to the Internet to get homework
help; or to simply fire up a computer to write a school report, is
almost as important for a kid as having access to books. But a lot
of families have enough trouble buying groceries. While computer
prices are lower than ever, even one of those $600 PCs that seem so
inexpensive to you represent a financial mountain for others.
</P>
<P>
   Most schools and churches can help you find a kid who needs a
computer. Or your own children may have a nomination to make. And,
if you have time, set up the computer and even give an hour or so
of instruction.
</P>
<P>
   If you take this route, you won't get a penny's worth of
deduction on your taxes. But my guess is it'll make you richer than
you ever dreamed possible. And your computer will have performed
one last fine task for you _ it may make you blush.

CAMPAIGN RHETORIC CLOUDING SOCIAL SECURITY ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARIETTA, Ohio _ What is most dispiriting about the 1998
campaign season is the artful camouflage it has used to cover up
the most important issue that will face President Clinton and a new
Congress next year: repairing Social Security so that it
responsibly supports the Baby Boom generation's retirement without
bankrupting either the government, the next generation or both.
</P>
<P>
   Both political parties are involved, to their shame, and the
result is likely to be the digging of several holes that will be
hard for each to climb out of next year and will make the
inevitable compromise harder to reach. And next year will be the
only chance, because 12 months from now, the pollution from the
first stages of the year 2000 presidential campaign will have
already begun.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, in a pivotal House campaign in this southern
Ohio district, Nancy Hollister was telling her potential
constituents that they can have it all _ that reforming Social
Security can be accomplished even as taxes are cut deeply again.
</P>
<P>
   There will be at least $1.4 trillion in federal budget surpluses
over the next decade, said the lieutenant governor and Republican
nominee. Those dollars can be locked up, she said, for Social
Security. But there will still be room for major tax cuts as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do both,'' Hollister swore. ``It's your money.''
</P>
<P>
   She isn't close to right. Listening to her reminded me of Ronald
Reagan in 1980 telling the country he could cut taxes, inflate
military spending, and still balance the budget in his first term.
More than $4 trillion in economy-crimping debt was what ensued.
</P>
<P>
   But Hollister's pose is compounded by that of her opponent,
Representative Ted Strickland _ a 1992 winner on this traditionally
GOP turf who lost to a Gingrich revolutionary in '94 and then came
back two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no surplus, apart from Social Security,'' says the
moderate and labor-oriented congressman. By definition, he argues
that any use of this ``surplus'' is a raid on the pension system.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland is technically correct. The government is still
operating in the red; the overall black ink last year, the first in
29 years, was the result of the surplus in receipts over spending
within Social Security, the result still of the bipartisan fix
crafted 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, Strickland's stance contains the equally dangerous
assumption that overall budget surpluses _ even if they continue
indefinitely as a byproduct of an economy that defies history and
doesn't stop growing _ might be adequate to ``solve'' Social
Security's long-range problem.
</P>
<P>
   And he ignores the very real possibility that the economy will
slow to a crawl or worse, making the use of budget surpluses that
have yet to materialize a risky foundation for tackling as immense
a looming problem as the Social Security system's health.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, give the Republicans their due, it could easily happen
that a stalled economy may need more than the ministrations of Alan
Greenspan's Federal Reserve to avoid recession. And the fact
remains that the federal tax burden is as high as it's been since
World War II; though the income tax is much less of a factor for
average families, the burden of payroll taxes, meaning Social
Security, remains onerous.
</P>
<P>
   But in pledging to ``save Social Security'' from Republicans
like Nancy Hollister, Strickland is really proposing that nothing
happen to the system.
</P>
<P>
   This is not what President Clinton had in mind as the year,
along with his self-inflicted scandal woes, began. The president's
idea was that the country should spend this year in serious
discussion of possible ways to give the system long-term health. To
an extent, it did for a while.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's idea was to block any use of the surplus for any
purpose until a reform is legislated, and a proposal from him is
due in January. In the campaigns, however, candidates (with ammo
supplied by each party) are using the issue as a club.
</P>
<P>
   For example, to help Hollister's campaign here, the Republican
Party is polluting the airwaves with commercials framing Strickland
as a tax addict. One of them slams him for his vote to help pass
Clinton's original economic program, credited with helping ignite
the subsequent recovery; as in the '94 campaign, that comes across
as the largest tax increase in history.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland also gets hit for opposing Newt Gingrich's
end-of-session gimmick that packaged $80 billion of minor tax cuts,
something the GOP Senate didn't even consider. And then, to
undercut his stance as Horatius, the ad says he ``voted to cut
Social Security,'' another previously used Republican falsehood
that refers to the increase in the amount of benefits that can be
counted as taxable income, something that only affected high-income
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   But Strickland gives as good as he gets. Hollister's support of
the House's tax cut stunt this month becomes a raid on Social
Security and her interest in individual retirement accounts using a
portion of payroll taxes becomes a gamble on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   This is a very close race, but the outcome is not likely to help
clarify the tough choices facing the country. By indulging their
lust for the jugular, the two parties are setting the stage for
stalemate.

<P>
   A millennium-old volume, defaced by mildew and scorched around
the edges, will go on the auction block on Thursday, and scholars
hope that expert examination of the relic will reveal nuances in
the thinking of Archimedes _ the greatest mathematical genius of
the ancient world.
</P>
<P>
   The volume, a 10th-century copy of writings by Archimedes (who
died in 212 B.C. at the hands of a Roman soldier), is the oldest
and presumably most authentic copy of Archimedes' major works to
survive. Christie's of New York City, the auctioneer selling the
little book, expects it to bring about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, the sale of the work may face a challenge. The Orthodox
patriarch of Jerusalem has claimed that the manuscript was stolen
in the 1920s and belongs to him, news agencies reported. The Greek
minister of culture, Evangelos Venizelos, told Agence France-Presse
that he supported the patriarch's claim.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's spokesman, Vredy Lytsman, said on Monday that the
auction house was ``still satisfied that the consigner has a legal
right to sell the document,'' and that the auction would take place
as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The volume has been inaccessible to scholars since the early
years of the 20th century. Technologies developed since then may
extract new knowledge about Archimedes from the text and diagrams.
</P>
<P>
   The 174 pages of text, bound in modern times into a book 7{ by 6
inches, spent some 1,000 years in the hands of various owners and
following a trail as twisted as that of the fictional Maltese
Falcon in the 1930 novel by Dashiell Hammett.
</P>
<P>
   Archimedes, a Greek who spent most of his life in the city of
Syracuse in Sicily, is remembered especially for the mathematics he
devised that prefigured the invention of calculus, and for his
discovery of the physics of flotation. A superb inventor and
engineer, his machines for pumping water, raising enormous weights,
and destroying enemy ships earned him a reputation among his Roman
foes as a kind of magician.
</P>
<P>
   The volume being auctioned, technically called a ``codex'' to
distinguish it from a scroll, is a palimpsest (pronounced
PAL-imp-sest). That is, its original inked copy of Archimedes'
texts was washed off, probably in the 13th century, so that the
expensive vellum on which it was written could be reused by the
Byzantine church or monastery that owned it.
</P>
<P>
   The upper text, clearly legible, consists of commonplace
instructions for conducting religious rites, like marriages and
exorcisms. The priceless underlying 10th-century text, almost
obliterated by washing, is the only surviving version of
Archimedes' ``Method of Mechanical Theorems'' and ``On Floating
Bodies'' _ the great scientist's two most celebrated works. The
Archimedes originals disappeared in the distant past, possibly
destroyed in the fires and looting that demolished the great
library of Alexandria, Egypt, in the third century.
</P>
<P>
   New techniques for reading the faint traces of the older text
have accentuated its enormous importance. Experts commissioned by
Christie's have revealed new detail, especially in geometric
diagrams, by exposing pages to ultraviolet radiation. This causes
the vellum, which is preserved animal skin, to glow, improving the
legibility of the writing.
</P>
<P>
   The experts also digitized images of the writing and applied a
computer program to suppress the 13th-century text and religious
illustrations while enhancing the underlying writing and
geometrical diagrams. The later religious text was written at right
angles to the Archimedes text _ a fact that facilitated the
separation of the two texts.
</P>
<P>
   Mathematicians and historians of science have been visiting
Christie's recently to look at the treasure. ``Just seeing and
touching the Archimedes Palimpsest was a thrilling emotional
experience for me,'' said Dr. Sherman Stein, a professor of
mathematics at the University of California, Davis. Like many other
mathematicians, Stein is fascinated by Archimedes' legendary
triumphs in mathematics, physics, engineering and weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recently finished writing a book about Archimedes,'' Stein
said, ``but because this palimpsest has turned up, I'll have to
revise one chapter. It won't change the substance, but some
subtleties of Archimedes' methods have come to light.''
</P>
<P>
   After languishing in obscure libraries for nine centuries, the
Archimedes Palimpsest was rediscovered in 1907 in the Convent of
the Holy Grave in Constantinople (renamed Istanbul in 1930). The
New York Times reported the discovery on page 1 of its July 16,
1907, issue.
</P>
<P>
   The discoverer, Dr. Johan Ludvig Heiberg, a professor of
philology at the University of Copenhagen, was not permitted by
Turkish authorities to remove the manuscript, but he was allowed to
copy it the best he could, and he later translated the legible
parts. Heiberg got another look at the manuscript two years later _
the last scholarly inspection of the treasure. In 1918, the Ottoman
Empire was dissolved by Turkey's defeat in World War I, and book
collections in Constantinople were broken up.
</P>
<P>
   A Christie's manuscript expert, Dr. Felix de Maraz Oyens, said
in an interview that some time after 1920, the palimpsest passed
into the hands of a French family that has owned it ever since.
Christie's declines to identify the family, which has put the
document up for auction.
</P>
<P>
   From the time of Heiberg's investigations in the early 20th
century until the document was entrusted to Christie's, it had
never been examined by anything more sophisticated than a
magnifying glass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hope Mayo, a consultant to Christie's on ancient books, said
that the auction house enhanced only a few pages of the palimpsest
to show what could be done. A more thorough inspection will be the
responsibility of its future owner, she said, although the book may
be bought by someone unwilling to grant access to scholars.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a terrible loss,'' said Dr. Chris Rorres, a
mathematics professor at Drexel University and an amateur
Archimedes scholar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rigorous mathematical proofs devised by Archimedes have
come down to us from various sources, but only his `Method of
Mechanical Theorems,' recorded in this palimpsest alone, lets us
see how he arrived at his proofs. It is a bit like a structure in
which the scaffolding goes up first, then the building, and finally
the scaffolding is taken away, leaving only the final result.
Archimedes' `Method' is the only remnant of his work that lets us
see the scaffolding,'' Rorres said.
</P>
<P>
   The Archimedes ``method'' starts by experimenting with physical
objects and then looking for the abstract principles that underlie
their interactions. In his introduction to the Method, Archimedes
wrote: ``It is easier to supply the proof when we have previously
acquired, by the method, some knowledge of the questions than it is
to find it without any previous knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Roman writers who chronicled the life of
Archimedes, the mathematician was a devoted subject of Hiero II,
ruler of Syracuse, and spent part of his career designing and
building weapons to defend Syracuse _ catapults, pulley hoists and
levers for disabling enemy ships and siege towers. The ancient
historians Polybius, Plutarch and Pliny the Elder all mention such
inventions, although none was alive in Archimedes' lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Some Greco-Roman historians also assert that during the Roman
siege of Syracuse from 214 to 212 B.C., at the height of the Second
Punic War, Archimedes used bronze mirrors to focus sunlight on
Roman ships and set them on fire.
</P>
<P>
   This anecdote, among many others about Archimedes, has been
called into question by various scholars, although Dr. Ioannis
Sakkas, a Greek engineer, demonstrated in 1973 that the feat is
technically possible. With the help of 50 sailors holding 31
bronze-coated mirrors, he set fire to a wooden boat 160 feet
offshore.
</P>
<P>
   Many historians believe that Archimedes was not the inventor of
the Archimedes Screw, a rotary pump commonly used in Egypt for
irrigation. Rorres said, however, that there were no references to
the device in Egyptian texts prior to the time of Archimedes, and
that he therefore might have invented it.
</P>
<P>
   But another famous anecdote _ that Archimedes leapt naked from
his bathtub and ran through the streets of Syracuse shouting
``Eureka'' (``I have found it'') after solving a problem _ seems
unlikely. According to the story by the Roman architect Vitruvius,
Hiero asked Archimedes to examine a gold wreath intended to adorn
the statue of a goddess, and to determine whether the goldsmith had
adulterated the wreath with silver.
</P>
<P>
   In the Vitruvius version, Archimedes notices that when he steps
into a tub full to the brim with water, some water spills from the
tub. Vitruvius wrote that Archimedes placed a weight of pure gold
equal to the weight of the wreath in the tub and then filled the
tub to the brim. Archimedes then supposedly took out the gold and
replaced it with the wreath, reasoning that a wreath adulterated
with silver would occupy more volume than an equal weight of pure
gold, and would cause water to spill.
</P>
<P>
   But Rorres challenged this version, saying that the amount of
spillage would have been much too small to measure using the means
at Archimedes' disposal. Instead, Archimedes would probably have
invoked his own Law of Buoyancy and Law of the Lever, first
balancing the gold weight against the wreath in air and then
balancing the two objects in water. An imbalance in water would
clearly reveal adulteration, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Be that as it may, Archimedes scorned the practical devices he
designed as intellectually inferior to his mathematical theorems,
and none of his writing refers to devices or engineering. In his
will Archimedes asked that a cylinder circumscribing a sphere be
placed on his tomb, illustrating what he apparently considered the
most important geometrical relationship he had proved: that the
volume of a sphere is two-thirds that of a circumscribed cylinder
of the same dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of about 75, Archimedes was supposed to have been
sketching a geometric proof at the moment Roman troops under
Marcellus overran Syracuse in 212 B.C. and killed the Greek sage.
Marcellus apologized to Archimedes' relatives, and the
sphere-and-cylinder symbol was placed on his grave, where the Roman
politician Cicero sought and found it 137 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Byzantium, the successor of the Roman Empire in the eastern
Mediterranean, was the custodian of the Archimedes Palimpsest for
centuries, but Archimedes' admirers give the Romans little credit.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George F. Simmons of Colorado College, Colorado Springs,
commented in ``Calculus Gems'' that ``the Romans were so
uninterested in mathematics that Cicero's act in cleaning up
Archimedes' grave was perhaps the most memorable contribution of
any Roman to the history of mathematics.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathematicians hope the Archimedes Palimpsest will command more
respect by its new owners.

SEPARATION ANXIETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. In 150 years, will the United States become separated
physically? T.K., Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you're wondering whether we're cracking up, the answer is
yes. Most of us have heard of the crack along the west coast of
California. The section of the Southwest called the Basin and
Range, which includes Nevada, southeast California, southern
Arizona, and a little of southern Utah, is also breaking apart. The
cracking is related to plate tectonics.
</P>
<P>
   Floating along on the hot mantle layer 70 miles below, the
Pacific plate and the North American plate are grinding past each
other in California. The coast is on the edge of the Pacific plate,
and the rest of the country is on the North American plate. The
Pacific is moving up to the northwest, as the North American plate
moves southeast.
</P>
<P>
   For rocks, they're moving pretty fast. If you painted a line
across the whole boundary, which includes the famous San Andreas
fault and several others, the line would soon tear in half. A year
later the space between the sections of line would be 2.4 inches.
In 150 years, the gap would be 30 feet wide!
</P>
<P>
   Joann Stock, professor of geology and geophysics at Caltech,
says, ``With that much movement, there's an excellent chance of
some big earthquake on the San Andreas fault in the next 150
years.'' But ``if such a quake occurs, it will probably create too
small a crack to consider that the United States has `separated
physically &UR; . &LR; '''
</P>
<P>
   But in the way the Earth works, 150 years is nothing. In a mere
blink of geologic time, about 10 million years, Los Angeles will be
roughly due west of where San Francisco is now. By then, says
Stock, there should be a pretty wide ``crack,'' perhaps even
covered by the sea, along a line running from the Gulf of
California in the south to the border with Oregon in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The cracking in the Basin and Range region is less well
understood. Most geologists believe that as the two plates grind
past each other, the Pacific plate is sort of grabbing onto the
western side of the North American plate and pulling it away. That
stretches the North American plate, distorting the Earth into the
mountains and valleys of the Basin and Range, which includes Death
Valley. But the rate of separation in the Basin and Range is only
one-third of an inch per year. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR;  &LR; Stock says geologists don't know if somewhere in the
Southwest the United States will eventually rip apart as
dramatically as the West Coast eventually will.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How old is the Earth? R.S.R., Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Probably about 4.5 or 4.6 billion years old. Nobody has found
any Earth minerals that old, but a meteorite that fell in Mexico in
1969 has been dated to 4.56 billion years, give or take 15 million
years.
</P>
<P>
   What, you ask, does something from space have to do with the age
of the Earth? Geologists think the Earth and the moon formed at
about the same time as other objects in our neighborhood of the
solar system, including meteorites, many of which have been dated
to the same age as the one found in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The terrestrial oldest rocks found so far have come from the
Canadian Shield in the Northwest Territories of Canada. Sam
Bowring, an MIT geologist, says in a paper to be published soon
that samples of Acasta Gneiss, a type of metamorphic rock, are 4.03
billion years old.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest Earth minerals are tiny grains of zircon found in
sandstone in Australia. The zircon is 4.3 billion years old, but
the sandstone in which it was found is just a teenager by
comparison, at 3 billion years. The zircon eroded out of rocks that
no one has located and got trapped in the younger sediments that
turned into the sandstone.
</P>
<P>
   How can we measure the age of minerals that old? Radioactive
decay causes certain elements to change their atomic structure and
break down into other elements, a process that Bowring says is
called the ``parent-daughter relationship.'' An unstable ``parent''
isotope breaks down into other isotopes until it turns into a
stable ``daughter'' form.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  In rocks, uranium decays finally to lead, rubidium ends up as
strontium, samarium finishes as neodymium. Scientists know how fast
the decay takes, so by measuring how much of the parent and the
daughter they find in a rock sample, they can calculate how long it
took to produce the lead, strontium, or neodymium.

LOS ANGELES JUDGE RECEIVES AWARD FOR JUDICIAL EXCELLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Veronica S. McBeth, presiding judge of the Los
Angeles Municipal Court, received the William H. Rehnquist Award
for Judicial Excellence on Monday for her efforts to increase the
court's involvement in the local community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to show people that the courts and judges care and are
concerned about the people that they serve,'' said McBeth, the
first African American and the first woman to receive the award,
named for the current chief justice of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, McBeth, 51, developed the First Impressions program,
which has helped more than 7,000 fourth graders in the Los Angeles
Unified School District learn about the legal system through
lectures and field trips.
</P>
<P>
   She also helped establish the Southeast Enhancement Project, in
which judges sentence nonviolent offenders to perform community
service in the neighborhoods of southeast Los Angeles. Supporters
credit the project with easing overcrowding in the local prison
system and promoting goodwill in southeast L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge McBeth is making the courts accessible to her community
by helping citizens understand the legal process, which is vital to
improving the public's perception about the courts,'' said Roger K.
Warren, president of the National Center of State Courts, a
research and educational group that sponsors the award. The award
honors state court judges who work to improve their court's
relationship with the local community.
</P>
<P>
   Warren also praised McBeth for her efforts in 1995 as head of
the first national conference on eliminating racial and ethnic bias
in the courts. He said that under her leadership the conference
drew participants from across the country and helped to identify
examples of racial and ethnic bias in the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   McBeth's best-known case came in 1985 when she sentenced a
slumlord to house arrest in one of his own apartment buildings.
Along with receiving national attention for its creativity and
common sense, McBeth's ruling led to a new state law sanctioning
such sentences.
</P>
<P>
   McBeth received a bachelor of arts degree in 1972 from
California State University at Los Angeles and her law degree from
the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1975. Before
her appointment to the bench in 1981, she worked for the Los
Angeles city attorney office.
</P>
<P>
   She was scheduled to attend a dinner with Chief Justice
Rehnquist Monday evening.

WHEN TUNA CANS LOOK FISHY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHLAND, Mass. _ Paul E. Brefka, who eats tuna fish at least
once a week for lunch, says he recently noticed the cans seemed to
contain more water and less tuna.
</P>
<P>
   An inventor and product designer who is curious by nature,
Brefka got out his scale and decided to check how much fish was
actually in a six-ounce can.
</P>
<P>
   What he found surprised him. He tested two cans of Geisha tuna
fish and found slightly less than four ounces of tuna in each can.
He wrote Geisha's corporate parent two complaint letters, but never
received a response.
</P>
<P>
   When he called us, we decided to put six major brands of solid
white tuna on Brefka's scale. The results were troubling. Every can
was the same size, but the tuna fish-to-water ratio in each can
varied considerably from brand to brand.
</P>
<P>
   Geisha, for example, had the most water and least fish, 3.8
ounces. Chicken of the Sea had the most tuna fish _ 5.1 ounces _
and least water. Bumblebee, StarKist, 3 Diamonds and Stop &AMP; Shop's
private label brand ranged between 4.1 and 4.5 ounces of tuna fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone I've talked to is amazed at this,'' said Brefka.
``They all look at that label that says `net weight 6 ounces' and
expect they're getting 6 ounces of tuna.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the net weight amount currently includes water. The
only real help the consumer gets in determining how much tuna fish
is actually in a tuna fish can comes with the serving size
information. The standard serving size for tuna fish is two ounces
drained of all liquid. The manufacturers say their six-ounce can
has about 2.5 servings, or 5 drained ounces of tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, according to Brefka's scale, all of the manufacturers
except Chicken of the Sea had less than five ounces of tuna in
their cans. The shortages ranged from a high of 1.2 ounces with
Geisha to a low of a half ounce with StarKist.
</P>
<P>
   It's not much in each instance, but it adds up quickly.
Americans buy about 2.2 billion 6-ounce cans of tuna fish each
year, according to the US Tuna Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Brefka also weighed a couple of 12-ounce cans of solid white
tuna fish for us and found at least nine ounces in each of them.
That was still less than should have been in the cans, according to
the serving-size information, but it was a better deal than the
six-ounce cans.
</P>
<P>
   For example, two six-ounce cans of 3 Diamonds in our test cost a
total of $2.18 and yielded 8.8 ounces of tuna fish. A single
12-ounce can of 3 Diamonds cost $2.09 and yielded 9.2 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Tuna fish canning companies questioned the accuracy of Brefka's
weighing methods. Indeed, he did not follow Food and Drug
Administration guidelines for weighing tuna fish. The guidelines
run three pages, are as impenetrable as IRS instructions, and
require special equipment for removing the water.
</P>
<P>
   But from what we saw Brefka was far more meticulous than a
typical consumer would be. He was careful in draining the water and
his scale was precise.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Bolding, general manager of communications at StarKist
Foods, the number one tuna fish seller in the United States, said
her company believes its cans are in full compliance with the law.
But she said StarKist would gladly replace any can that has less
than five ounces in it.
</P>
<P>
   David Burney, executive director of the US Tuna Foundation, said
the industry has been trying for three years to convince the FDA to
approve labels that more accurately describe the contents of a can.
He said the ``net weight 6 ounces'' reference on the current labels
causes all sorts of problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very confusing for us, for the FDA, and for the
consumer,'' Burney said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an FDA spokeswoman initially told us that a can of tuna
fish with the words ``net weight 6 ounces'' on the label should
contain 6 ounces of tuna fish. She later backed away from that
statement, saying a law passed in the early 1970s allowed tuna fish
companies to include water in the net weight.
</P>
<P>
   A second law passed in 1990 set forth standard serving sizes for
every product and required manufacturers to disclose how many of
those serving sizes were in each container.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA, at the urging of the tuna industry, has now proposed
new regulations that would require the net weight information to be
based on drained weight and to match the serving size amount. In
other words, tuna fish cans in the future will probably say ``net
weight five ounces.'' Let's hope that's how much tuna fish is
actually in there.

LIVE HIGH, TRAIN LOW AND MOVE FASTER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   For years, many endurance athletes have believed that exercising
in thin mountain air is the best way to improve performance at sea
level. But recently, a team of doctors gave a new spin to the
high-altitude hypothesis and discovered that living a more
sedentary life in the mountain air while training at a lower level
gives athletes the greatest gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives a 1 or 2 percent improvement,'' said Dr. Benjamin D.
Levine, a co-author of the study and a professor of internal
medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern in Dallas. ``That
may not seem like much, but that's the difference between winning
the gold medal and not getting to the finals.''
</P>
<P>
   Called ``living high and training low,'' the program is gaining
acceptance among some athletes. Dr. David Martin, chairman of the
sports science subcommittee for U.S.A. Track &AMP; Field, the national
governing body for track, is encouraging elite distance runners to
adopt the program. And athletes all over the world are finding
innovative ways of putting the research into practice.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, exercise scientists have known that the body, even
if sitting or sleeping, responds to high altitude by creating more
red blood cells to boost oxygen levels. The increased oxygen can,
in turn, enhance an athlete's endurance during training and
competition.
</P>
<P>
   But the benefits of high-altitude training, which gives an even
greater boost to red blood cells, are offset by the negatives, said
Levine, who also is the director of the Institute for Exercise and
Environmental Medicine at Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas. Humans
cannot fully compensate for the limited oxygen and therefore cannot
train at their maximum ability, he said. As a result, the athletes
lose muscle and their performances may suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Early studies showing the benefits of high-altitude training are
now considered suspect by many sports physiologists. Dr. Anthony A.
Sucec, professor of exercise and nutritional science at San Diego
State University, said that researchers often monitored only a
small group of athletes, used no control groups, and did not factor
in psychology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most runners are city people, they train and live in smoggy
places,'' he said. But when they get to altitude, they may be able
to train harder because the environment is attractive, they like
the clean air, there's no distractions, and they're more relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty was enough to persuade the United States Olympic
Committee to pay for Levine's five-year study, which was published
last year in the Journal of Applied Physiology. For the report,
Levine and his former colleague, Dr. James Stray-Gundersen, an
orthopedic surgeon who now works in Norway, monitored 39 collegiate
and national caliber runners.
</P>
<P>
   After working out at sea level in Dallas to reach a base fitness
level, the athletes were sent to live and train at various altitude
combinations. When the camps ended, only those who lived high and
trained low improved their performance in a five-kilometer run at
sea level.
</P>
<P>
   They bettered their times by an average of 13.4 seconds. In
contrast, the group that lived high and trained high was an average
of 3.39 seconds slower, while the athletes who lived low and
trained low were an average of 26.7 seconds slower.
</P>
<P>
   Finding high-altitude living quarters within commuting distance
of low-altitude training facilities can be challenging. Elevations
of at least 8,000 feet are believed to be required for
high-altitude living and below 4,000 feet for low-altitude
training. The runners who benefited most in Levine's study had a
30-minute drive between their rooms in Park City, Utah, and a track
in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   To get around the commute, Finnish sports officials built a
so-called nitrogen house that simulates altitudes of nearly 9,000
feet. Nordic skiers and biathletes spend the day training outside
at sea level, then go indoors to eat and sleep in an environment
that is pumped rich with nitrogen to reduce the amount of oxygen in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   Sian Welch, a triathlete from San Diego, is trying another
tactic. She spent $12,800 for a sleeping chamber that could
simulate altitudes higher than the Rocky Mountains. The chamber, a
cylinder made of a fiberglasslike material and made by a company
based in Boulder, Colo., is just long enough inside for a person to
lie on a small mattress. Once the chamber door is shut, a vacuum
pump draws out the air until the level reaches that of the desired
altitude. Athletes typically spend all night inside breathing the
thin air while they sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like the races are a little easier for me because of
the chamber,'' said Ms. Welch, who placed eighth this month in the
Ironman Triathlon in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Levine called the concept of such chambers ``intriguing but
untested.''
</P>
<P>
   They are also a point of debate with some athletes and officials
who believe that using high-altitude chambers is unfair and akin to
the illegal practice of blood doping, which involves athletes'
removing some of their own blood, allowing their bodies to
replenish red-blood cell supplies, then intravenously restoring the
removed blood to increase their oxygen-carrying abilities.
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee is considering whether the
chambers should be banned.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has a problem with athletes going to the mountains,''
said Dr. Don McKenzie, a professor of medicine at the University of
British Columbia in Vancouver who advises Canadian Olympic
athletes. ``But when it comes to artificially inducing that
environment, then there are some concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletes who live in high-altitude areas have also found
creative ways to simulate the lower altitudes they need for
training. When attending high-altitude training camps in such
places as Winter Park, Colo., altitude 8,000 feet, U.S. cyclists
sometimes do sprints on stationary bicycles while wearing gas masks
that feed them air that is as rich in oxygen as at Death Valley,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with being at that high an altitude is that you
can't work out at the same intensity as lower down,'' said Sean
Petty, director of athlete performance for U.S.A. Cycling, the
sport's national governing body. ``So on some days we would ride
the stationary bikes with the oxygen masks set at sea level or just
below. Then, on other days, we would train on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the most common form of living high and
training low is probably the block system. For example, the United
States swim team may spend several weeks training in the relatively
high altitude at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs,
altitude 6,000. The team then descends to sea level for three to
six weeks of training in places like Tuscaloosa, Ala., and San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use the altitude to produce the cardiovascular strength,''
said Jonty Skinner, one of the team's coaches. ``I take them down
to sea level for the sprints to push them to a higher level.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine called such programs ``suboptimal if not completely
ineffective.'' He added that the benefit of living and working out
in Colorado Springs, the home of several United States sports
teams, is questionable because the air there is too thin for
maximum training but not thin enough to boost endurance.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests another, more scaled-down version that he says is
effective but demands less travel: Athletes live at a high altitude
part of a week and go through relatively light workouts. The other
part of the week, they must commute to sea level for sprints.
``It's just more convenient,'' Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   Though altitude training tactics are used primarily by elite
athletes, some neighborhood gyms are trying them as well. For
example, members at the Lakeshore Towers Sporting Club by 24 Hour
Fitness, in Irvine, Calif., can work out on a treadmill in a sealed
room in which the oxygen level is maintained by a filter at 8,000
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you can increase your oxygen delivery system, you
increase your endurance,'' said Kyle Hettinger, fitness supervisor
at the club.
</P>
<P>
   But, Levine called this concept ``the worst of all
circumstances.'' People who use these rooms, he said, do not stay
inside long enough to get a boost in red blood cells and cannot
train at their maximum because there is too little oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   As beneficial as living high and training low may seem, it is
not for all athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are those who do not respond to high altitude. In
research published this month in the Journal of Applied Physiology,
Levine reported that nearly half of the runners he studied had no
increased oxygen carrying capacity after living for four weeks at a
high altitude.
</P>
<P>
   For some unknown reason, their bodies did not adjust to the
climate. It is possible, Levine speculated, that such athletes must
be exposed to even thinner air to respond.
</P>
<P>
   But high-altitude training is absolutely necessary,
physiologists agree, when athletes prepare for competition in high
altitude locations, like Mexico City, home of the 1968 Olympics. If
they do not, they may suffer from altitude sickness that will leave
them gasping for air.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are expected to study more precisely what altitudes
are required for living high and training low, and whether
high-altitude sleeping chambers are effective.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his enthusiasm for high-low training, Levine warns that
it is no magic bullet, especially for amateur athletes. The extra
bump that an amateur athlete may get from altitude is grossly
outweighed by the benefit such an athlete can get from careful,
controlled training at sea level, Levine said. Altitude is not a
panacea.''

HOME SHOPPING MOGUL'S NETWORK LOOKS LIKE DIAMOND IN ROUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lowell ``Bud'' Paxson didn't have many believers
when he predicted in August that his newly launched broadcast
network would be in the black within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months later, Paxson is reassessing his estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Now he thinks Pax TV, television's seventh network, could show a
profit as early as February. And there are a few market analysts,
he says with a chuckle, for whom he's preparing a ``feast of
crow.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxson, co-founder of the Home Shopping Network, seems to have
figured out a way to make the spiritually minded, family-friendly
network financially successful, doing it so far with a steady diet
of second-run shows.
</P>
<P>
   Its weeknight prime-time lineup consists of such familiar fare
as ``Touched by an Angel'' and ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.'' Only
20 percent of its schedule is occupied by original programming. The
combination keeps Pax TV's programming budget comparatively slim.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies part of Paxson's secret to success.
</P>
<P>
   His strategy: Spend less to produce shows, spend more to promote
the network, and own everything _ the network and the stations.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   RATINGS PULSE
</P>
<P>
   Pax TV (KPXN, Channel 30, check local cable listings), brand new
and available in 70 percent of the country, has achieved a 1.1
rating during prime time in the 31 markets in which it appears that
are metered by Nielsen Media Research. The network's Los Angeles
affiliate has a 1 rating.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like nothing compared to the ratings the Big Three
networks rake in. CBS, for example won the television season's
second week with a 9.5 average prime-time rating. But, remember,
those networks spend ungodly sums to air new products _ NBC paid
$286 million for this season of ``ER'' alone _ and recouping those
costs require big ratings. Pax doesn't spend anywhere near that
much.
</P>
<P>
   The new network has set its programming budget at a
comparatively measly $100 million per year, while programming an
entire broadcast day; even the other upstart broadcast networks,
the WB and UPN, spend three times that on programming to fill only
10 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   And to keep the costs of producing original programming to a
minimum, Pax does business with independent producers instead of
more expensive major studios. The result: Pax spends an average of
$800,000 for an hour drama, compared to the $1.2 million to $1.6
million other networks pay.
</P>
<P>
   Low production costs mean Pax TV needs only minimal ratings to
make money. Paxson has said that a 0.6 Nielsen rating (about
600,000 households nationally) is all his network needs to break
even.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ecstatic with the way it's going,'' Paxson said recently.
``I'm really pleased at how America has responded to it.''
</P>
<P>
   America, indeed, appears to be tuning in to the morals-heavy Pax
TV, a broadcast network with all family programming all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Even Pax's commercials are rated G; the stations won't accept
advertising for alcohol and psychics, nor will it air violent movie
trailers.
</P>
<P>
   KEEPING IT CLEAN
</P>
<P>
   Going against industry trends _ which, in the last few years,
have begun leaning toward more sex, more violence and more liberal
use of foul language on shows _ and giving America what it
apparently wants, is ground Paxson knows well. In his four decades
in the broadcasting business _ from radio to television _ he has
found success.
</P>
<P>
   He is best known for co-founding the Home Shopping Network in
1982, selling billions of dollars worth of clothing, knickknacks
and cubic zirconium. &UR;  &LR; The Home Shopping Network not only made him
wealthy, selling it off paved the way to set up the new network.
</P>
<P>
   His vision for Pax TV is to take viewers to that happy place
people yearn to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to copy the Hallmark Hall of Fame,'' said Paxson, a
born-again Christian. ``They are always great shows, have a little
spirituality, are good family programs and are warm and fuzzy.''
</P>
<P>
   The handful of shows Pax TV is developing on its own for daytime
and weekend time slots fits the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flipper: The New Adventures'' (9 p.m. Saturdays) is a remake
of the classic '60s series about a friendly dolphin who helps a
family in its weekly adventures; ``Great Day America'' (5 p.m.
weekdays), an upbeat version of ``The Today Show''; ``It's a
Miracle'' (9 p.m. Sundays), a reality-based show containing
uplifting stories; and ``Cloud Nine'' (7 a.m. Saturdays, 6 a.m.
Sundays), about a group of angels who run a television station,
used as a wrap-around for the network's children's programming
block.
</P>
<P>
   Another new series, ``Little Men,'' based on the Louisa May
Alcott book, will debut at 8 p.m. Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   THE SAGANSKY FACTOR
</P>
<P>
   Pax TV, which has less at stake than the other six networks, has
offered the perfect place to let these kinds of family shows grow
and be nurtured, said Paxson Communications Inc. president and
chief executive officer Jeff Sagansky, who was the head programmer
at CBS and developed many of the shows reprised on Pax TV's
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Media buyers, who advise clients about how to spend their
advertising budget, tend to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it has long-term potential,'' Tim Spengler, senior
vice president and general manager of the national broadcast
division of Western International Media, a Los Angeles-based media
buying firm, said of the wholesome, family-oriented network. ``We
think it is a great alternative for our clients.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt that Pax TV operates in a different stratosphere
than the other networks when it comes to advertising rates.
Advertising on Pax is similar to that on a basic cable station,
which also penetrates about 70 percent of the country. A
half-minute national ad costs about $5,000 on a Pax station,
compared to about $100,000 for a hit on the WB.
</P>
<P>
   The newest network can afford to offer such reasonable rates
only because of another Paxson operating mode: He owns all the
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson says the television advertising industry reaps
approximately $37 billion a year, with part going to the networks
and part to the stations. ``We own the stations and get to dip into
every one of those piles _ national, regional and local,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As with the Pax TV programming budget, the stations also are run
at a relatively low cost. Paxson downsized the staffs at his 80
stations to prepare to launch the network. Now, Sagansky said, a
Pax station has an average of 18 employees _ eight of whom sell
advertising _ compared to an average 100 employees for any network
affiliate in a large city.
</P>
<P>
   The positive early returns are aided by a large promotional
budget _ $25 million for the final three months of 1998, which will
be spent primarily through November sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   The prognosis for the newest network will be more clear after
November ratings are compiled.
</P>
<P>
   But Paxson, a shrewd businessman who paid $1 million an episode
for ``Touched by an Angel,'' is not running this venture in a
haphazard manner. He claims that studies have been done stating
that the American public is hungry for shows like the ones on his
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty-five percent of all Americans say there is too much sex
and violence on television,'' he said, quoting a survey. ``People
say they have a spiritual side and want family-oriented programming
with a little warmth in it.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's free, unlike those fake diamond rings he used to sell.

WHEN TUNA CANS LOOK FISHY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHLAND, Mass. _ Paul E. Brefka, who eats tuna fish at least
once a week for lunch, says he recently noticed the cans seemed to
contain more water and less tuna.
</P>
<P>
   An inventor and product designer who is curious by nature,
Brefka got out his scale and decided to check how much fish was
actually in a six-ounce can.
</P>
<P>
   What he found surprised him. He tested two cans of Geisha tuna
fish and found slightly less than four ounces of tuna in each can.
He wrote Geisha's corporate parent two complaint letters, but never
received a response.
</P>
<P>
   When he called us, we decided to put six major brands of solid
white tuna on Brefka's scale. The results were troubling. Every can
was the same size, but the tuna fish-to-water ratio in each can
varied considerably from brand to brand.
</P>
<P>
   Geisha, for example, had the most water and least fish, 3.8
ounces. Chicken of the Sea had the most tuna fish _ 5.1 ounces _
and least water. Bumblebee, StarKist, 3 Diamonds and Stop &AMP; Shop's
private label brand ranged between 4.1 and 4.5 ounces of tuna fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone I've talked to is amazed at this,'' said Brefka.
``They all look at that label that says `net weight 6 ounces' and
expect they're getting 6 ounces of tuna.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the net weight amount currently includes water. The
only real help the consumer gets in determining how much tuna fish
is actually in a tuna fish can comes with the serving size
information. The standard serving size for tuna fish is two ounces
drained of all liquid. The manufacturers say their six-ounce can
has about 2.5 servings, or 5 drained ounces of tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, according to Brefka's scale, all of the manufacturers
except Chicken of the Sea had less than five ounces of tuna in
their cans. The shortages ranged from a high of 1.2 ounces with
Geisha to a low of a half ounce with StarKist.
</P>
<P>
   It's not much in each instance, but it adds up quickly.
Americans buy about 2.2 billion 6-ounce cans of tuna fish each
year, according to the US Tuna Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Brefka also weighed a couple of 12-ounce cans of solid white
tuna fish for us and found at least nine ounces in each of them.
That was still less than should have been in the cans, according to
the serving-size information, but it was a better deal than the
six-ounce cans.
</P>
<P>
   For example, two six-ounce cans of 3 Diamonds in our test cost a
total of $2.18 and yielded 8.8 ounces of tuna fish. A single
12-ounce can of 3 Diamonds cost $2.09 and yielded 9.2 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Tuna fish canning companies questioned the accuracy of Brefka's
weighing methods. Indeed, he did not follow Food and Drug
Administration guidelines for weighing tuna fish. The guidelines
run three pages, are as impenetrable as IRS instructions, and
require special equipment for removing the water.
</P>
<P>
   But from what we saw Brefka was far more meticulous than a
typical consumer would be. He was careful in draining the water and
his scale was precise.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Bolding, general manager of communications at StarKist
Foods, the number one tuna fish seller in the United States, said
her company believes its cans are in full compliance with the law.
But she said StarKist would gladly replace any can that has less
than five ounces in it.
</P>
<P>
   David Burney, executive director of the US Tuna Foundation, said
the industry has been trying for three years to convince the FDA to
approve labels that more accurately describe the contents of a can.
He said the ``net weight 6 ounces'' reference on the current labels
causes all sorts of problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very confusing for us, for the FDA, and for the
consumer,'' Burney said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an FDA spokeswoman initially told us that a can of tuna
fish with the words ``net weight 6 ounces'' on the label should
contain 6 ounces of tuna fish. She later backed away from that
statement, saying a law passed in the early 1970s allowed tuna fish
companies to include water in the net weight.
</P>
<P>
   A second law passed in 1990 set forth standard serving sizes for
every product and required manufacturers to disclose how many of
those serving sizes were in each container.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA, at the urging of the tuna industry, has now proposed
new regulations that would require the net weight information to be
based on drained weight and to match the serving size amount. In
other words, tuna fish cans in the future will probably say ``net
weight five ounces.'' Let's hope that's how much tuna fish is
actually in there.

BUYERS NOT EASILY SCARED BY HOMES NEAR CEMETERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CORRIE M. ANDERS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The first time friends visited Mike and Beth
DeCoss at their new home, a few of them felt a bit, well, spooked.
Just beyond the DeCoss' back yard, over a low-slung fence, was a
sprawling, 1850s graveyard that the friends hadn't expected to see.
</P>
<P>
   Their unease dissipated quickly enough. But sharing a lot line
with such permanent residents doesn't bother the couple. ``Ghosts
and goblins have never been a part of my fear factor,'' said Mike
DeCoss, a retired human resources manager.
</P>
<P>
   The proximity to Oak Mound cemetery in suburban Healdsburg also
doesn't seem to have scared away other home buyers or hurt property
values. In August, the DeCosses paid the asking price and moved
onto a popular cul-de-sac in a neighborhood of $450,000 homes that
back up to the 20-acre burial ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has had a problem with it,'' Mike DeCoss said. ``It
looks very peaceful and the other day I was watching a family of
six deer. It's way better than having a neighbor looking in over
your fence.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people wouldn't be caught dead living so close to a
cemetery. Others, however, find a blessing in the quiet and open
space. But whether a cemetery is a desirable residential address _
and whether it has a negative impact on property values _ depends
on geography, culture and religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Hatfield has lived for 48 years in Colma, a suburban
cemetery town with 1,200 living residents and 1.5 million souls.
Homes and apartments sit close to the town's 17 cemeteries,
including Cypress Lawn, the resting place of some of San
Francisco's most prominent figures and the backdrop for key scenes
in the cult movie ``Harold and Maude.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield, president of the Colma Historical Association, has a
direct view of a cemetery from her home. She and her neighbors
bought their ``old, cheap houses'' in the 1950s for $9,000 and have
watched them rise in value to more than $200,000 today.

   ``All of the original residents are still here and it doesn't
bother them a bit,'' Hatfield said. ``All of our kids are coming
back and buying houses ... if they can afford them.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip C'de Baca lives on the grounds of Pet's Rest, a
relatively small cemetery for animals that he owns and operates in
Colma. His two-story home also backs up to a large Russian Orthodox
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   But C'de Baca said he didn't believe his property values have
been affected ``one way or another'' _ even though he said his home
is haunted.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a ``lot of unrest in the house'' since the 1930s,
when the original owner, a dentist, killed his wife, C'de Baca
said. The long-term tenant sometimes displays malevolent
tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was asleep one night,'' said C'de Baca, who once ran for
City Council, ``and I was pinned down. I couldn't talk. I couldn't
get up. I saw something floating over me for what seemed like
hours, but was probably a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talked to my wife in the morning, she said the same
thing had happened to her,'' C'de Baca said.
</P>
<P>
   That was a decade ago and the ghost continues to rattle around
the C'de Baca home, he said. Still, he said, ``I prefer living in a
cemetery. If it wasn't a cemetery, there would be wall-to-wall
apartments here.''
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners who live near cemeteries said they are more likely to
suffer more from gag house-warming gifts _ crosses, silver bullets
and wooden stakes _ than from unannounced visits by poltergeists.
They fret more about mischievous kids at Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you had the old-time graveyard look with tipped
tombstones and poor care, that could create a situation where they
could be a deterrent'' for home buyers, said Brian Marlowe,
president of the Washington, D.C.-based International Cemetery and
Funeral Association.
</P>
<P>
   Modern cemeteries typically are well maintained, Marlowe said.
For people nervous about cemeteries, he said, it's mostly ``one of
those things where the lack of familiarity breeds discomfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlowe added that he remembered researching the 1951 inception
of a cemetery in suburban Washington. ``When this cemetery was
first proposed, it was a very rural area and most of the folks in
the community were opposed to the idea of having a cemetery in
their midst,'' Marlowe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, the cemetery was created,'' he said. ``It remained a
beautiful green and quiet space and the area around it quickly
filled up with residential (properties) and it became a desirable
place to live.''

   Take one affluent neighborhood in Menlo Park, Calif., where
homes share a wooden fence with the historic Holy Cross Cemetery.
Most neighbors treat the two-acre burial ground and its park-like
setting as if it were ``their cemetery,'' said Katherine Atkinson,
director of cemeteries for the San Francisco Archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're almost possessive of it and help to keep it
beautiful,'' Atkinson said. ``If a board on the fence falls down or
a tree limb falls, they take care of it themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the value of residential properties can suffer if
they are cemetery neighbors, said real estate broker John Wong,
president of a Prudential California office in San Francisco. ``It
reduces the number of buyers,'' he said, though the impact on
values may be subtle and somewhat difficult to quantify.
</P>
<P>
   Home sellers in California and many other states are required to
disclose to potential buyers anything that could significantly
affect the value or desirability of a property. That includes any
death there _ natural, murder or suicide _ within three years of
the property being offered for sale.
</P>
<P>
   But what about a belief that ghosts reside in a home?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure ghosts can be considered a fact or whether they
even exist,'' said Debra Ferrier, assistant general counsel for the
California Association of Realtors. ``What we tell our Realtors is:
`When in doubt, disclose.'''

NOTE TO NASA: SOPWITH CAN'T BEAR TO BE LEFT BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sopwith the Bear has his beady little sights set on space
travel. The 87-year-old British teddy, rescued from the wreckage of
a de Havilland 5 in World War I, has found a new career in the
1990s as a celebrity fund-raiser for charities, flying for pledges
in some of Britain's most sophisticated aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   His owner, Frances Fagan of Berwick-upon-Tweed, recently told a
reporter from The Daily Telegraph that Sopwith's ultimate goal is
to fly into space with NASA. I called Fagan and asked if she'd made
any progress persuading the agency to put Sopwith in space. She
hadn't. She wasn't even sure how to begin the process. ``How can we
get him on a space shuttle?'' she asked. ``It seems they're popping
one up there every 20 minutes, but they never seem to send a bear
up.''
</P>
<P>
   If NASA were to send up a teddy, Sopwith would seem an ideal
candidate. True, he's even older than John Glenn. But he's a
genuine World War I aviation hero, the official mascot of a flying
squadron. More recently he's flown with the Royal Air Force in a
Tornado F3, with the Royal Navy in a Harrier jump jet. He's been
lowered out of a Sea King helicopter into a lifeboat during an RAF
air-sea search-and-rescue mission, and jumped with the RAF Falcons
Parachute Team. He's flown in historic planes, including Spitfires,
Hurricanes, and Lancers. He solos in his own teddy-size
remote-control biplane.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; if,,.2l &LR;  Fagan said she and her husband, Peter, acquired
Sopwith at an auction at Christie's in 1991. ``He'd kept a fairly
low profile until then,'' Fagan said. Sopwith came with a letter
explaining his history. His original owner, Second Lieutenant
Arthur Turnbull, died when his plane crashed during a training
flight in 1917. Sopwith was found under a twisted propeller and
returned to Turnbull's family.
</P>
<P>
   Sopwith's low-profile days ended when Fagan, a public relations
consultant, got her hands on him. Now he's a famous bear. He has
fans. He hobnobs with celebrities like the legendary Dame Vera
Lynn, who sang ``We'll Meet Again'' for him. He's been awarded so
many honors and decorations that his little body can barely
accommodate them all at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of my job to dream up wild schemes and do them,''
Fagan said. ``We've had a lot of fun with Sopwith. And he's raised
thousands of pounds for charities.''
</P>
<P>
   Is space travel in Sopwith's future? A NASA official, who asked
that his name not be used, said the agency has no official policy
about sending stuffed animals into space. There is, he said, a
procedure that allows people to apply to send souvenirs, mementos,
awards, and the like aboard space flights. Items that are used for
commercial purposes or fund-raising, no matter how good the cause,
are excluded, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sopwith might be eligible if his flight could be shown
to serve an educational purpose. Sopwith must make a formal
application to NASA, he said, and the whole process could take some
time, years even.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sopwith's adventures continue. A few weeks ago, he
was offered the opportunity to fly the Concorde to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on a television program talking about all the things
we've been doing,'' Fagan said, ``about all his mad aims and
ambitions. I said his main aim was NASA, but that he'd also like to
go supersonic. Somebody from British Airways telephoned the program
and invited him.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the invitation doesn't include a seat for a
companion. ``Somehow, I think he'll just fly with the pilot, as
usual,'' Fagan said. ``But I'll be there to wave him goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Once here, Sopwith would like to fly aboard Air Force One, Fagan
said, or with one of the elite military flying units.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that film with Tom Cruise? `Top Gun'?'' Fagan said. ``I
can quite see Sopwith going top gun.''

AUGUST WILSON RETHINGS WHAT'S ON THE PAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ August Wilson is sitting in Ann's Cafeteria, a linoleum
and formica spot just a few doors down from The Huntington Theatre
Company where the two-time Pulitzer Prize winner's play,
``Jitney,'' runs until Nov. 22. If there were more black people
inside, you'd swear it was the setting for one of his plays. It's a
lived-in, eaten-in, smoked-in restaurant that serves breakfast on
trays all day.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old dramatist, on break from rehearsals, is
wrestling with his first full-length play, which he wrote in 1979
about unlicensed cab drivers in the Hill District of Pittsburgh.
The core of the play is centered on a father, Becker, and his
estranged son, Booster, who returns home after serving prison time
and attempts to reconcile with his father. It's a familiar theme
played out in different ways at different times for different
generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt I would have written this play today,'' says the
impressively forthright Wilson, while nursing a cup of tea in a
ceramic cup. ``Because I'm not the same person as I was back then.
Basically, it stays with the same events and characters and story
line, but I rewrote four scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson goes on to explain, in attentive detail, how he's
re-worked certain elements that he couldn't resolve as a younger
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how to write the scene between the father and
his son,'' he says, ``so I just killed off the father. But I always
knew it was a problem. Now that I see it differently, I'm glad I
have the opportunity to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson seems relaxed. If it's not too contradictory, he seems
easy going and intense simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing is rewriting and re-thinking,'' he says. ``The problem
with many young writers is they don't want to rewrite. And I don't
mean just patching up. I mean rewriting and rewriting. Over and
over because that's the way the material reveals itself. It's like
mining gold. You have to go through a lot to get the value.''
</P>
<P>
   Value and values matter to Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   One of the places he learned about both was at the Carnegie
Library in his hometown of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   At 15, Wilson was one of the top students at Gladstone High
School. He was so proud of a 20-page paper he wrote on Napoleon he
asked his sister to type it for him. When he submitted it, his
teacher, a man he neglects to name except to say that he was a
black man who went on to become a member of the Board of Education,
told him that he deserved either an A+ or an F.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher thought the paper might not be original and, when
push came to shove, he failed Wilson. The hurt ran deep. The next
day, Wilson returned to school but didn't go in. He stayed outside,
shooting baskets. No one even asked him what he was doing there.
That marked the end of his formal education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my mother I was going to school and I went to the
library,'' he says. ``I couldn't believe it. At the library they
didn't even ask you if you could read, they would just give you
these books. I would start books that I didn't even understand. I
remember Ruth Benedict's `Patterns of Culture.' I didn't understand
much of it, but I knew I'd come back to it. I read theology and a
history of aviation. I read a book on furniture-making and dreamed
about making things even though I didn't have one tool.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in one way, that's exactly what Wilson does as a
playwright. He dreams with words.
</P>
<P>
   He's written more than 20 plays. ``Fences,'' set in 1957, and
``The Piano Lesson,'' set in 1936, brought him Pulitzers and Tonys.
He's been honored with five New York Drama Critics Circle Awards
for those two dramas along with ``Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,'' set
in 1927; ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone,'' set in 1911; and ``Two
Trains Running,'' in 1969. ``Jitney'' follows previous Huntington
productions of ``Seven Guitars'' in 1995, ``Two Trains Running'' in
1990, ``The Piano Lesson'' in 1988, and ``Joe Turner's Come and
Gone'' in 1986. All of them honor the neighborhood of his
Pittsburgh youth, some literally, others figuratively. These are
voices he heard and remembered as he moves on his quest to cover
each decade of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, acting on the habits he developed as a youngster,
remains a voracious reader but he doesn't spend much time watching
television or going to the movies or the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an 11-year period when I didn't go to the movies at
all,'' he says. ``Then, my wife convinced me to go. I can't
remember what the movie was. But towards the beginning a guy rides
a horse into an elevator in a hotel lobby. It was illogical. I
spent the rest of the time in the lobby reading Time magazine.
Also, the movies aren't art, anymore. They're manipulative
commerce. That's why the movies are so bad. For my money,
`Chinatown' is the greatest of all American movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson also has had a tough time getting his plays made into
movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1987, Eddie Murphy bought the rights to `Fences' for
Paramount Pictures. This year they extended the rights again. Barry
Levinson wanted to do it, but I wanted a black director. The studio
guy said that there are no black directors. I thought he should be
jailed for making a statement like that. It's criminal. There are
plenty of fine black directors. For him to have all this power and
be so ignorant. I thought he should be arrested and jailed.''
</P>
<P>
   What's even more surprising than Wilson's animosity toward
movies in the late 20th century is that he rarely goes to the
theater. He didn't see his first Shakespeare play until 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a production of `Hamlet' with Ralph Fiennes,'' he
recalls. ``I didn't like it. A lot of shouting and I didn't
understand what they were saying. Maybe the fault was with the
actors.''
</P>
<P>
   The one art form that Wilson loves is music, particularly, jazz
and the blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had more than 2,000 78 rpm records,'' he says. ``Louis
Armstrong. Bessie Smith. Coleman Hawkins. Julie London. Anita
O'Day. Hoagy Carmichael.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Wilson seems inspired. He smiles, leans across the
table and begins singing in a deep, meaningful voice that caresses
the lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played me a waiting game ...'' he sings. ``Remember Walter
Huston singing that song?''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson leans back, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I have a blues aesthetic. Listening to those people
sing those songs over the years ... they meant it.''
</P>
<P>
   During his career, Wilson has found himself speaking in favor of
black-owned and black-run theaters. In a well-publicized debate
with the American Repertory Theatre's Robert Brustein at New York's
Town Hall early last year, Wilson articulated his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't much of a debate,'' he says, ``but my general idea
is that American theater is definitely narrow. It doesn't include
the values of Asians, blacks, Hispanics, and others. American
theater is defined as European American theater. Ibsen. Chekhov.
Arthur Miller. Shakespeare. And it preserves thought. I want to
preserve thought, too. Black thought. But we don't have the
theaters and institutions to do that. When people in American
theater put on a black play _ and I salute that _ they think they
are being inclusive. I appreciate having support from theaters such
as the Huntington and others. But I am an invited guest. As such,
I'm treated with respect and dignity. But, I can't move the
furniture around. It's not my furniture. And, eventually, I have to
leave because it's not my house. It's not my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson pauses. He takes out a little cigar from a tin but he
doesn't light it. He gave up cigarette smoking years ago but he's
recently grown fond of cigars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, any gains by blacks are too often seen as
encroachment by whites,'' he says. ``That's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson points out that in Seattle, where he lives, the city just
built a new symphony hall with $94 million of public money. The
Seattle Seahawks football franchise and Seattle Mariners baseball
team are spending some $354 million to build separate stadiums for
their respective sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's no money for education? There's not $2 million for
a black theater where all of Seattle can come to see the great
contributions of African Americans?'' he asks. ``It just doesn't
make any sense to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in the rehearsal hall, Marion McClinton, who directed a
previous incarnation of ``Jitney'' in Pittsburgh in 1996 and has
acted in and directed other Wilson plays, explains why the
playwright's dramatic songs have survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his specificity that makes his plays so unusual,'' says
McClinton. ``August honors my parents, my aunts, my uncles ... he
does them justice and gives them dignity and integrity. In the
recognition of a life, you can recognize your own life on the
stage.'' McClinton pauses, staring at a black wall dial telephone
nailed to a pillar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were here 150 years from now,'' he says. ``We'd still be
seeing August's plays. He takes ordinary lives that summon up the
universe.''

BATTLING DEMON RUM 
The Struggle for a Dry America, 1800-1933 
By Thomas R. Pegram 
Ivan R. Dee, 207 pp., $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alcohol is as American as Mom, apple pie, and Prohibition. When
the Puritans arrived on Boston's shore, in 1630, they brought with
them 10,000 gallons of beer, 120 hogs- &QC; 
heads of brewing malt, and a dozen gallons of distilled spirits.
John Adams drained a breakfast tankard of hard cider every morning
when he was president. Until the early 19th century, farmhands,
artisans, soldiers, and sailors all got daily rations of rum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no merry-making, there was no entertainment of
relatives or friends, there was scarcely a casual gathering of two
or three neighbors for an evening chat without strong drink,''
Horace Greeley remembered from his Vermont childhood around 1820.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol was the country's social, commercial, and political
lubricant. It was also, temperance advocates claimed, a devil's
broth that led to sin and disease, turned men into drunkards,
corrupted youth, and ruined families.
</P>
<P>
   The battle between ``wets'' and ``drys,'' conducted from
legislatures to street corners, went on for more than a century. It
culminated in Prohibition, the most controversial social experiment
in American history. And it ended in repeal in 1933, with even the
drys conceding the experiment had failed.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Battling Demon Rum,'' Thomas P. Pegram provides an
informative and readable chronicle of the temperance movement
between 1800 and 1933. He traces its birth from the religious
revivals and ``perfectionism'' movement of the early 19th century,
its early peak in the 1850s, its collapse after the Civil War, its
renaissance with the rise of women's suffrage, its victory after
World War I, and, finally, its demise during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Given the universal presence of liquor in American life from the
day the Puritans landed, it seems remarkable that enforced
temperance ever took hold at all.
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-1800s, people drank alcohol because it was the
best option available. Most drinking water was dubious, milk was
too perishable, coffee and tea were too expensive. Whiskey, which
most Americans could make in their back yard, cost only 25 cents a
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1800 and 1830, the average citizen over 15 consumed a
staggering 7 gallons of pure alcohol a year, more than twice
today's amount. But as America shifted from an agrarian to an
industrial society, from a rural to an urban one, the effects of
mass tippling became obvious and undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear of disorder and anxiety over the fate of the family, the
moral order, and the nation itself prompted temperance activism,''
observes Pegram, an associate professor of history at Loyola
College in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Moral suasion gradually gave way to enforced teetotalism as
temperance advocates, many of them middle-class evangelical
Protestants, pushed states to pass prohibition laws. Their focal
point was the saloon, the symbol of vice and dissolution. The
saloon, wrote historian Norman Clark, created ``images of sodden
drunks, of hideously fat men sucking stale cigars, of toilets
fouled with vomit and urine in the haze of alcoholic narcosis, of
the blind idiocy of drunken violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Saloons were not only incompatible with the family hearth, they
were a symbol of women's exclusion from a male-dominated society.
When temperance made a comeback after the Civil War, it was women
who carried the banner, first with the street-marching Women's
Crusade, then with the Women's Christian Temperance Union.
</P>
<P>
   But what finally brought about Prohibition, Pegram explains, was
World War I, which silenced German brewers, shut down the liquor
industry, and gave the government vast (if temporary) authority.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the '20s wore on, it became obvious that Prohibition was
both unenforceable and unwanted, ``the creaky obsession of
puritanical moralizers, rural busybodies, and religious bigots.''
The prevalence of bathtub gin and a quarter of a million
speak-easies, the rise of organized crime, changing social mores,
and the onset of the Depression made repeal inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Pegram points out in his epilogue, the image of
Prohibition remains a powerful if unstated presence in America.
With binge drinking a major problem on college campuses and
lawmakers trying to crack down anew on underage consumption,
``Battling Demon Rum'' is a timely historical text.

NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE SYSTEM PUTS `CRITTERS' FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)  
(gm)

 c. 1998 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Exuberance and optimism _ rare among wildlife advocates in these
days of anti-environmental legislation _ bounced off the walls of
the conference center at Keystone, Colo., for four days last week.
Managers of the nation's wildlife refuges and top officials from
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the agency in charge of the
refuge system, came together to discuss the future of this precious
network of federal wildlife lands and waters.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Rappaport Clark, director of the USFWS, called the meeting
historic, the first time all the refuge managers have ever been
gathered together. ``We will be setting the direction of the system
and unifying the 514 refuges,'' she added. More than 800 federal
employees and nearly 100 members of conservation groups attended
the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997 _
one of the few congressional ``improvement acts'' in recent years
that actually improved anything _ provided the impetus for the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The act, based upon President Clinton's 1996 Executive Order No.
12996, states that the mission of the refuge system is to
administer its network lands and waters ``for the conservation,
management and where appropriate, restoration of fish, wildlife,
and plant resources and their habitats within the United States for
the benefit of present and future generations of Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clark expressed it, ``The act puts `critters first.''' Only
the 93-million-acre National Wildlife Refuge System has that
mandate from Congress. The other public lands agencies have
different priorities. On our refuges, wildlife comes first. That's
a first.
</P>
<P>
   According to Clark, in terms of legislative authority, ``the act
set the goals and made the agency equal to all the other public
land agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The act does more. It authorizes the Secretary of the Interior
to ``ensure ... the biological integrity, diversity, and
environmental health of the System.'' And for the public, the act
gives a priority to ``compatible wildlife-dependent recreation''
like hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, photography, education
and interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Now Clark's agency and refuge managers must set objectives and
issue regulations in order to implement the refuge system act. The
act gives them two years to accomplish these goals.
</P>
<P>
   President Theodore Roosevelt started the refuge system in 1903
when he set aside Florida's Pelican Island to protect nesting brown
pelicans from plume hunters. From that tiny beginning, the system
has spread across the nation. There are wildlife refuges in every
state. For example, Wyoming has seven refuges on 77,000 acres;
North Dakota has 65, accounting for nearly 300,000 acres;
Washington state has 22 refuges on 178,000 acres; Maine has nine on
47,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   According to recent USFWS figures, the refuge system attracts
more than 32 million visitors each year and brings more than $400
million into surrounding communities. Some community leaders
recognize this and form productive partnerships with their local
refuge officials to help maintain a quality wildlife experience for
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt raised that theme during
his speech at the conference. He urged refuge managers to work with
conservation groups, community leaders and landowners to expand
good wildlife management principles across refuge boundaries. ``We
don't want refuges to be isolated islands,'' he said, ``Water
issues affect almost all refuges and threats to refuges often come
from outside the refuges.''
</P>
<P>
   The most significant theme in Babbitt's speech was his advocacy
for a more inclusive ecological thinking, one that stretches far
beyond the confines of the refuges. He recommended the formation of
partnerships with non-governmental entities to help transform that
ideal into reality.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt used the occasion to take a firm but provocative stance
on building new roads: ``As long as I am secretary of the Interior,
I'll see to it that no road goes through the Izembek wilderness
(Izembek National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska). Roads are the single
most destructive agent to the wilderness. We have to stop slicing
and dicing the wilderness with roads. If Izembek gets a road, no
wilderness is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   This year the Alaska congressional delegation pushed hard for
legislation to authorize a road through the Izembek wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the 1997 NWRS act seems to grant Babbitt the
authority to halt any future road building in refuges.
</P>
<P>
   The 104th was perhaps the most anti-environmental Congress in
recent history. Dan Ashe, USFWS assistant director for Refuges and
Wildlife, explained how the refuge act managed to get enough votes
to pass in that atmosphere: ``When members of the National Rifle
Association and the Defenders of Wildlife walk into a congressional
office together and ask for the same thing, it works.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ashe, hunting and fishing rights on refuges became
the focus of the bill for members of Congress. It's a potent
combination.
</P>
<P>
   And the NWRS act will make a difference to the general public.
Anne Marie LaRosa, outgoing manager of the Seedskadee National
Wildlife Refuge in southwest Wyoming, said the legislation will
allow the agency ``to focus on the visitor's enjoyment of solitude
and view of wildlife.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans already know how precious wild lands are to one's
spiritual sense of connectedness with self, with nature and with
the universe. Let us hope the refuge system grows and fulfills its
deep promise. We can all share the optimism.

Siege.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Imagine that you're a talented actress _ really talented, and
beautiful to boot. Imagine you have looks, talent and even brains
... and that you don't want to be a movie star.
 &HT;    How would you go about it? Well, it couldn't hurt to start
acting on the stage, and be good enough to score a Tony nomination
_ Hollywood is always suspicious of stage actors.
 &HT;    Then when you start making movies, do your best work on quirky
pictures such as Stephen Frears' ``The Grifters'' (1990). If the
resulting buzz _ and a best-supporting-actress Oscar nomination _
nevertheless lands you roles in big pictures opposite big stars
such as Harrison Ford and Warren Beatty, you'd probably be best
advised to get married, have a lot of babies and put your career on
hold for years.
 &HT;    Oh, and just to round things off, be sure to marry a big star
who's been famous since practically before you were born. His
starpower should ensure that Hollywood never sees you as yourself
again.
 &HT;    Annette Bening took all these steps, but has somehow managed to
remain one of Hollywood's most respected, most in-demand actresses.
 &HT;    ``The fact is, I want to have children and I want to work,''
Bening says. ``I feel lucky to be in the job I'm in. I've always
wanted to act, since I was a kid, and having three children has not
changed that.
 &HT;    ``I've gone through an enormous experience having children, a
physical and emotional experience,'' the actress adds. ``It's been
fantastic, and it's taken me away from all of this. It's been a
real joy, each time I've been pregnant, to just disappear into this
entirely different part of my life.
 &HT;    ``In terms of mothering and doing it all, it's tricky, but it's
worth doing.''
 &HT;    Right now, Bening _ whose children are 6, 4 and 1 _ is busier on
screen than she's been since she first met Beatty. She stars in Ed
Zwick's ``The Siege,'' opening Nov. 6, then will turn up early next
year in the thriller ``In Dreams.'' She's currently shooting
``American Beauty'' with Kevin Spacey, and soon will take to the
stage for the first time in nearly a decade for a Los Angeles
production of ``Hedda Gabler.''
 &HT;    Right now, she's focused on ``The Siege,'' which casts Bening as
Elise Kraft, a mysterious CIA operative assigned to thwart an Arab
terrorist plot in Manhattan. This brings Kraft into conflict with
Anthony Hubbard (Denzel Washington), who's in command of the joint
FBI/NYPD terrorism task force.
 &HT;    The two initially clash, but find themselves on the same side
when the president declares martial law and sends in a hardline
general (Bruce Willis) who incarcerates all the city's
Arab-Americans and, in the eyes of Hubbard and Kraft, becomes as
much a threat to America as any terrorist.
 &HT;    In New York for a round of interviews at the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel, the wafer-thin Bening sports black slacks and a black jacket
over a white shirt. She's charming yet serious, open but guarded.
 &HT;    ``When I did my research,'' the actress says, ``the very first
question I needed to answer for myself was `Is this plausible? How
plausible is this woman? How plausible is this dilemma?'''
 &HT;    After talking with two former CIA operatives, she stopped asking
that question.
 &HT;    ``Of course, it's all extremely possible,'' she says, even the
shots of Arab-Americans caged. ``I think it is an incredible image,
and very disturbing. When you get to that point in the movie, Ed
Zwick has made it plausible that we could find ourselves in that
situation.
 &HT;    ``We've been there already,'' she adds. ``We did it to the
Japanese-Americans in World War II. So I think the politics in the
movie are very smart, and I think they address something that's on
everybody's minds right now.
 &HT;    ``If the movie works,'' she concludes, ``it's because it's
moving and it gets you on some gut level. No matter how good the
politics are in anything, if you aren't laughing or riveted or
crying or somehow involved on an emotional level, we have failed.''
 &HT;    Kraft is the emotional center of the film, but she's a
tremendously complicated figure. Bening admits to some worries
about whether audiences will understand the implications of her
character's intricate background.
 &HT;    ``I tried as best I could to make her dilemma clear _ I was very
concerned about that,'' the actress says nervously. ``They may not
totally understand every nuance of the politics of her problem, but
if they at least feel she's feeling guilty about something and is
trying to make it better, I'll be OK.''
 &HT;    ``In Dreams'' is another unsettling project, with Bening cast as
a woman psychically connected to a deranged killer, played by
Robert Downey Jr.
 &HT;    ``I think the word is disturbing,'' Bening says of the film,
directed by Neil Jordan. ``I don't know how people will react to
the movie.
 &HT;    ``I was so interested in the problems this woman has, in Neil
and a very arresting story,'' she says. ``It's extremely hard
stuff. So I don't know how people will respond.''
 &HT;    The 40-year-old Bening is no stranger to problematic subject
matter. Her best movies have included ``Valmont,'' the 1989 version
of the sexually intricate ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses,'' as well as
the twisty caper ``The Grifters'' and ``Bugsy,'' Beatty's 1991
gangster drama.
 &HT;    Since then she's made only two films _ ``Love Affair'' (1994)
and ``The American President'' (1995) _ but nevertheless finds
herself in demand, even at an age when Hollywood traditionally
starts finding it hard to cast women.
 &HT;    ``I just try to make sense of my own life, my own needs and what
interests me,'' she says. ``My family interests me and acting
interests me. I've not yet been in a position where I can't serve
my own acting ambitions.
 &HT;    ``It's painful and unfair that there's this idea about age and
movies,'' the actress adds. ``Living in L.A., I see the
preoccupation with youth and beauty. I've always instinctively
avoided that.
 &HT;    ``I think the best thing I can do is take care of myself _ and I
don't mean physically, I mean emotionally. I mean keeping track of
what's satisfying and important to me.''
 &HT;    Bening stops talking, and gestures a couple of times without
saying anything. She's clearly searching for the right words.
 &HT;    ``Those of us who are in a position to make choices, who have
some clout, need to fight for what's right, for how we're
portrayed,'' she says at last. ``A lot of what's going on is just
economics, part of a general cultural phenomenon about what is
popular.
 &HT;    ``If people want young, sexy people, what can I do? Part of it
for me is just looking to other women who represent something to
me, who are who I want to be.''
 &HT;    And being a wife and mother is definitely part of that. Bening
doesn't like to talk publicly about her husband _ in an entire
interview, she never once mentions him by name _ but she makes
clear that she never saw any downside to involvement with him,
never feared that she might be reduced, in the minds of others, to
Mrs. Warren Beatty.
 &HT;    ``It never occurred to me,'' Bening says, eyes opening wide.
``Maybe I was naive. I was nominated for an Academy Award before I
ever met him, so I felt I'd gotten on track.
 &HT;    ``Had I sat and thought about it, would I have done anything
differently?'' she muses. ``I don't think so. If your heart's in
the right place, you go with that and follow that.''

ADAM SANDLER, `SATURDAY NIGHT' SURVIVOR

 Includes a color slide of Adam Sandler with Henry Winkler in a
scene from ``The Waterboy.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Live from New York, it was Adam Sandler, walking slowly up the
steps of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, the home of NBC, and into Studio 8H.
 &HT;    Chris Farley wasn't there. Neither was Phil Hartman. The stage
looked smaller, Sandler recalls, on his first visit in years to the
set where he had starred in ``Saturday Night Live.''
 &HT;    ``I stood there and my heart hurt,'' he says. ``I was thinking
about Farley and how much fun we had together.
 &HT;    ``Chris Rock and I auditioned together on that stage,'' he adds,
sighing. ``We all grew up there, but only some of us made it.''
 &HT;    Sandler has made it big. ``The Wedding Singer'' (1997) grossed
more than $100 million worldwide, and now there is good buzz on his
new comedy, ``The Waterboy,'' opening Nov. 6. When they talk about
up-and-coming young film comics, Sandler heads the list.
 &HT;    In person, however, the actor doesn't resemble the goofballs he
plays on screen. He's a shy, pensive, 32-year-old who knows that
life isn't a laugh a minute.
 &HT;    ```When you're a comedian, the problem is that there is no
middle,'' he says. ``You're either pretty damned excited about
something or pretty damned depressed about something else.
 &HT;    ``Honestly, every part of my life is tough,'' Sandler adds. ``I
make it tough on myself. I get nervous. I want to do as good as I
can do.''
 &HT;    His own success seems to amuse him.
 &HT;    ``My dad makes fun of my mom,'' Sandler says. ``Every time my
mom mentions me to someone, they love me. My mom says, `Miriam at
the grocery store is 72, but she loves you.' You hear my dad in the
background going, `Everybody loves him.'''
 &HT;    Practically everybody seems to have loved ``The Wedding
Singer,'' and early signs are promising for ``The Waterboy,'' which
features Henry Winkler as a football coach and Sandler as a
bumbling, unathletic waterboy who, as it turns out, has a knack for
a punishing tackle that makes him a star.
 &HT;    Most comedians have stories of being as socially isolated as
Sandler's character, but he himself says not.
 &HT;    ``I'm sure I was in and out of having my feelings hurt by some
people when I was in high school,'' he says. ``But then again, I
wasn't an angel. So I can't consider myself a guy who got picked on
_ it was push and pull.''
 &HT;    And being funny wasn't his ticket to popularity, either.
 &HT;    ``Looking back, I wasn't really that funny,'' he says. ``I was
like this little annoying kid. My parents would laugh at my jokes
and then walk away shaking their heads.''
 &HT;    At school, the future comic logged his fair share of time in the
principal's office.
 &HT;    ``I didn't get in bad trouble,'' he insists. ``I wasn't the guy
who the teacher was scared of. She wasn't screaming, `My God, what
is the guy going to do?' I definitely talked too much, yelled too
much, and I got in trouble for just being loud.
 &HT;    ``I love my family a lot,'' he adds, ``so I feel bad about the
amount of damage I must have caused to the tranquillity of our
house.''
 &HT;    As the youngest of five children in one of the few Jewish
families in his New Hampshire town, Sandler admits that he always
felt a little different. Those memories inspired his CD hit ``The
Hanukkah Song.''
 &HT;    ``When I was a kid, people would say stupid things to me about
religion,'' he recalls. ``I did that song for other kids, so they
could relax a little bit more about not celebrating Christmas.
 &HT;    ``I'm sure it helps a lot of kids who like me as a comedian to
know that I'm the same as them,'' he adds. ``I know when I was a
kid my dad would talk about Kirk Douglas and tell me he's Jewish.
I'd say, `That's good.' I didn't feel so alone.''
 &HT;    Actually, Sandler originally dreamed of being a rock star. When
that fell through, he attended New York University to study acting
and writing _ though he learned his best lessons at a local
stand-up place called The Dive.
 &HT;    ``The deal was I could only do my act if I'd bring in my own
crowd,'' he recalls. ``And they would have to pay a steep cover
charge.''
 &HT;    After graduation he took to the stand-up circuit, which is where
producer Lorne Michaels discovered him and asked Sandler to
audition for ``Saturday Night Live.''
 &HT;    ``Rock and I auditioned the same night,'' the comedian recalls.
``We both did OK, but the deal for me was that I was going to be
hired as a writer for `SNL.'''
 &HT;    He was hired in 1990, but his sketches were often too eccentric
for the other comics to grasp. A few months later Sandler became a
featured player, and his Opera Man and Cajun Man became ``Saturday
Night'' staples for three seasons.
 &HT;    Then he left, seeking a movie career. He'll admit to having had
his doubts.
 &HT;    ``I kept thinking, `My life is going to be different. I wonder
if it will be OK,''' he recalls. ``Me and Farley left together,
which made it easier. We'd talk on the phone all the time and say,
`Are we going to be all right? Is this going to be OK?'''
 &HT;    Sandler's post-``Saturday Night'' life includes the golf-movie
bomb ``Happy Gilmore'' (1996), a hit with ``The Wedding Singer''
and a slew of stage performances _ despite a lifelong problem with
stage fright.
 &HT;    ``Every time I go on stage, I feel panicky,'' he admits. ``I'm
always wondering why I got myself into it. I always swear I don't
want to do it, I won't get myself in that situation ever again.
 &HT;    ``A movie set is a lot easier,'' he says. ``If you screw up, you
do it again. Being on stage or even coming out on a talk show, I
babble. I get nervous. I don't know why I'm out there.''
 &HT;    Farley's death hit him hard, Sandler says.
 &HT;    ``When I would go hang with him, I mostly saw the up days,'' the
comedian says, his words coming slowly. ``When Chris was down, I
would talk to him and try to get him up again. The sad thing is
that he would always try to be up for you. He was such a lovable
guy.''
 &HT;    Sandler's own world is much different from Farley's
free-partying style. A quiet-life kind of guy, Sandler admits that
he has a girlfriend, though he won't say who she is.
 &HT;    ``I was doing stand-up and she was in the audience in the front
row,'' he recalls. ``I looked down and waved to her. She was
smiling _ she just seemed so nice and supportive. That doesn't
happen very much when you're on stage. Normally, I look down into a
lot of angry faces. Hers stood out.''
 &HT;    Next up, Sandler will star in ``Guy Gets Kid,'' a comedy due out
in 1999. He plays a man who adopts a 6-year-old boy to impress his
girlfriend _ a natural subject for a performer whose greatest fans,
he says, are children.
 &HT;    ``The thing that makes me feel the best,'' he says, ``is when a
kid waves and screams, `It's Adam Sandler!'
 &HT;    ``I like hanging with kids and seeing them happy,'' he says. ``I
know what comedy meant for me at that age. Nothing else about fame
except the kids is important to me.''
 &HT;    Do adults also wave?
 &HT;    ``A few people over 30 wave,'' the comedian says, ``but they're
all my mother's friends.
 &HT;    ``They drive by in cars and scream, `Everyone loves him!'''

 Includes a color slide of Hector Elizondo in a scene from ``Chicago
Hope.'' 
 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.1998 Canadian TV Guide  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hector Elizondo is as much in favor of the information age as
the next guy, but even he was taken aback recently to learn that
fans had created a website _ hectorelizondo.com _ in homage to the
veteran character actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stunned,'' Elizondo says, smacking his forehead in mock
despair. ``Who are these people out there who do these things? I
didn't start it, believe me. There's stuff about me on there that
even I've forgotten about _ and I don't need to be reminded!''
</P>
<P>
   The website is only the latest acknowledgement that Elizondo is
at the top of his game. His work as stern hospital administrator
Dr. Philip Watters on ``Chicago Hope'' has earned him four Emmy
nominations and one win _ most recently, he lost out in September
to ``NYPD Blue's'' Gordon Clapp _ and he continues to appear in
movies such as ``Pretty Woman'' (1990), ``Dear God'' (1996),
``Turbulence'' (1996) and others. Odd as it sounds, at 62 Hector
Elizondo has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, I was like the guy in the American Express
commercial,'' he says wistfully. ``Nobody knew who I was until they
saw the name typed on the bottom of the screen. For 30 years I got
what I call `the squint' from people in public. They would think:
`Don't I know this guy? Do I owe this guy money?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now if I'm in a restaurant, everybody knows me from some movie
or `Chicago Hope,''' he says. ``It's nice, but I miss that old
anonymity.''
</P>
<P>
   His newfound fame was a long time coming. Born in New York,
Elizondo has been a trouper since his first paying gig, playing
congas for the Ballet Arts Company at Carnegie Hall back in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   After a career detour into dance and several years treading the
boards of Broadway, Elizondo entered the 1970s as a ubiquitous face
in film after film, including ``The Landlord'' (1970), ``Valdez is
Coming'' (1971), ``Pocket Money'' (1972) and ``The Taking of Pelham
One, Two, Three'' (1974).
</P>
<P>
   His television career was less noteworthy. He was offered the
Freddie Prinze role on television's ``Chico and the Man,'' but
turned it down because he deemed it offensive to Hispanics. A role
he did accept, Claude Rains' old role as Capt. Louis Renault in the
1983 series ``Casablanca,'' was deemed offensive to purists _
though the show fortunately was a quick failure.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the 1970s and 1980s the movie roles kept coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``A crazy time for me,'' Elizondo says with a laugh. ``I was
playing cops, bad guys, whatever. And I could play any ethnic type,
because I grew up in New York. I was the man of a thousand races!''
</P>
<P>
   Many actors have struggled to make the stylistic transfer from
film to television or back again, but Elizondo says that making the
commitment to ``Chicago Hope'' five years ago meant only minimal
adjustments in his acting.
</P>
<P>
   He describes creator/executive producer David Kelley's approach
as ``one long, continuing movie. David Kelley writes the best
dialogue on television, and the show avoids cliches. And there's no
such thing as a cliche doctor _ they're mountain climbers,
athletes, jazz musicians.''
</P>
<P>
   His own character, Watters, is a quirky former Vietnam medic
who, despite having lost his wife to cancer and knowing his son
committed suicide, rules Chicago Hope hospital with an iron hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an old street fighter, this guy,'' Elizondo says,
chuckling. ``He's not a natural administrator, but he gets the job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Off-camera, Elizondo indulges his lifelong passion for playing
jazz guitar, keeps trim by boxing and spends as much as time as
possible with his wife and ``soulmate,'' actress Carolee Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   He also continues to keep busy on the big screen, as he closes
in on his 50th film. In particular, he continues to work with
director Garry Marshall, who clearly finds Elizondo as captivating
as television audiences do: He's cast the actor in 10 films,
including ``Young Doctors in Love'' (1982), ``The Flamingo Kid''
(1984), ``Pretty Woman'' and ``Frankie and Johnny'' (1991).
</P>
<P>
   No. 10, ``The Other Sister,'' was recently completed, and later
in the autumn Elizondo will begin shooting on No. 11 with Marshall,
a much-anticipated movie indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called `Runaway Bride,''' the actor says, ``and it's
Julia Roberts, Richard Gere and myself, together again. Guess who
people will be watching?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exactly a sequel to `Pretty Woman,''' he adds, ``but
it's the same kind of story.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories of actors clashing with directors are legion, but after
10 films together, Elizondo says he's still looking forward to his
next collaboration with Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He creates this lovely atmosphere on the set,'' the actor
says. ``The first thing he says every day is `Good morning _ did
you eat?' He cares about people first, and he knows life is more
important than show business.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, however, Elizondo plans to hang onto his day job on
``Chicago Hope.'' If nothing else, it's a learning experience:
After all, he says, Dr. Watters is the longest-running character
he's ever played.
</P>
<P>
   And playing a doctor has given him insights into the medical
profession as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Elizondo says, lighting a cigar. ``Stay healthy.''

RETURN TO GLORY: THE 10 BEST TELEVISION RERUNS EVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of William Shatner, Nichelle Nichols,
DeForest Kelley and Leonard Nimoy in a scene from ``Star Trek.'' 
 By JAY ATKINSON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Two lists published last summer generated a lot of controversy:
the Modern Library's ``100 Best American Novels'' and the American
Film Institute's ``100 Best American Films.''
 &HT;    Backyard barbecues rang with debate over Ernest Hemingway's
underrated classic ``A Farewell to Arms'' (1929), as well as the
glaring omission of Bill Murray's ``Caddyshack'' (1980).
 &HT;    But now that a new television season has officially begun _ that
is to say, now that the first losers have been canceled _ it's time
we turned our collective attention to the idiot box.
 &HT;    After all, television is both the poor man's literature and the
cheap man's movie theater. And new shows come and go, but a good
rerun is forever.
 &HT;    Presented here for water-cooler discussion is one more list _
the 10 best television reruns of all time.
 1. `STAR TREK' (1966-1969)  
 &HT;    Not the bland, politically correct 1990s version, but the
genuine article, the ``Star Trek'' of Kirk, Spock, McCoy and an
army of nameless security guards who were killed wholesale _ by
falling Styrofoam rocks, alien tractor beams, 1930s Chicago
gangsters and marauding Greek gods.
 &HT;    Despite the cheesy scenery and the fact that William Shatner
wore a girdle, his Captain James T. Kirk became a cultural
touchstone, the Everyman of outer space.
 &HT;    This show also taught us that the little people don't matter, as
long as the regulars get out alive and refrain from violating the
Prime Directive _ which must have been ``get yourself an ironclad
residual deal.''
 2. `THE ROCKFORD FILES' (1974-1980)  
 &HT;    James Garner defined humorous cool as private eye Jim Rockford,
a 40-something ex-con who drove a gold Firebird and lived in a
trailer on the beach.
 &HT;    Rumpled, sad-eyed and charming, Rockford has to his credit
arguably the coolest line ever spoken on television. Reacting to a
beautiful ex-girlfriend who's tried to con him, then almost gotten
them both killed, the confirmed bachelor said, ``Old times buy you
one ticket, and you just cashed that in.''
 &HT;    Someday I'd like to buy creator Juanita Bartlett a drink.
Bourbon straight up, of course.
 3. `THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW' (1960-1968)  
 &HT;    It's a testimony to the writers and actors of this program that
most people think there is such a place as Mayberry, where a
laconic sheriff watches over his spastic deputy while surrounded by
such lovable eccentrics as Floyd the stuttering barber, Otis the
drunk who lets himself into the jail and the crazy hillbilly Ernest
T. Bass.
 &HT;    Each night Andy went home to Aunt Bea and Opie, and in his
brooding eyes you could see that he still mourned his late wife.
 4. `KUNG FU' (1972-1975)  
 &HT;    The Eastern philosophy of nonviolence, delivered by a balding
American who quoted Shaolin teachings and kicked major butt.
 &HT;    Even the credits were classic: David Carradine dancing along the
rice paper and leaving no trace, snatching the pebble from his
master's hand, picking up that smoldering hibachi with his
forearms.
 &HT;    Note: A recent attempt to repackage this show, with the pudgy
Carradine appearing as his own grandson, proves F. Scott
Fitzgerald's maxim that there are no second acts in American lives.
 5. `THE WHITE SHADOW' (1978-1981)  
 &HT;    The author Sherwood Anderson said that the best way to create
memorable stories was via the ``boy gang.'' This show featured the
racially mixed Carver High School basketball team, with the
toupee-wearing Ken Howard as coach Ken Reeves.
 &HT;    Each player was an authentic, well-rounded character, including
a Mexican-American from the wrong side of the tracks, the
can't-miss black center and the tough-talking street kid, Mario
``Salami'' Pettrino, as played by Timothy van Patten.
 &HT;    The accumulated episodes seemed to move forward in real time,
the characters retaining their memories, their collective past, as
they peeked out of the locker room at real life.
 6. `THE MONKEES' (1966-1968)  
 &HT;    Along with the vastly underrated ``Batman'' (1966-1968), this
was the ``Must-See TV'' of its era. Think ``Friends'' with a better
soundtrack.
 &HT;    The Monkees were Hollywood's answer to the Beatles, the Pre-Fab
Four, hyperactive moptops assembled from the spare parts of dead
vaudevillians. Watch a couple of their frenetic numbers, and you'll
never have the urge to stare at MTV again.
 7. `ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH-IN' (1968-1973)  
 &HT;    Remembered more for its quick-cutting style than its comedic
content, this was the establishment's weirdly watered-down stab at
the counterculture. ``Laugh-In'' launched the careers of such
luminaries as Jo Anne Worley, Henry Gibson and Twiggy, not to
mention Lily Tomlin and Goldie Hawn.
 &HT;    Of all the surreal cameo appearances which peppered this show,
perhaps the strangest was the time Richard Nixon popped up and said
``Sock it to ... me?''
 8. `YOUR SHOW OF SHOWS' (1950-1954)  
 &HT;    Starring Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca, in the days when there
were 17 television sets in the entire country and an unwavering
test pattern was considered a hit. There's no indication anyone
ever watched this program, but apparently ``best of'' lists have to
contain at least one dead dinosaur.
 &HT;    Later Sid Caesar became a reformed alcoholic, fitness fanatic
and egotistical talk-show bore. A better, funnier choice for
egotistical talk-show bore, incidentally, would be ``Late Night
with David Letterman'' (1982-1988).
 9. `COMBAT' (1962-1967)  
 &HT;    The progenitor of all war shows, including ``M*A*S*H''
(1972-1983), ``McHale's Navy'' (1962-1966), ``Hogan's Heroes''
(1965-1971), ``China Beach'' (1988-1991) and many more. A 1960s
noir, it featured the late Vic Morrow as World War II Sgt.
Saunders, who each week led his patrol of weary existentialists
through the French countryside, which resembled southern
California.
 &HT;    If it sounds a lot like ``Saving Private Ryan'' (1998), I'm sure
that's no coincidence.
 10. `LEAVE IT TO BEAVER' (1957-1963)  
 &HT;    Although this program, like ``Father Knows Best'' (1954-1963),
``Make Room for Daddy'' (1953-1971) and ``The Many Loves of Dobie
Gillis'' (1959-1963), has been retroactively criticized for its
stylized, white-bread depictions of suburban life, ``The Beav''
remains one of the benchmarks of light comedy.
 &HT;    Who could forget Wally's insincere pal Eddie Haskell uttering
the line, ``That's a beautiful dress, Mrs. Cleaver, for a woman of
your limited means''?
 WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE ...   
 &HT;    Because no list is long enough, honorable mentions to:
 &HT;    + ``The Twilight Zone'' (1959-1965), created by that spooky
chain smoker, Rod Serling.
 &HT;    + ``Saturday Night Live,'' in the John Belushi/Dan Ackroyd era,
1975-1979.
 &HT;    + ``The Tonight Show,'' starring Johnny Carson and the
definitive chortling sidekick, Ed McMahon, from 1962 through 1987.
 &HT;    + Mel Blanc and his thousand voices, especially Bugs Bunny.
 &HT;    + ``Monty Python's Flying Circus,'' which wasn't even American.
 &HT;    + ``Barney Miller'' (1975-1982), the best cop show ever put on
the small screen.
 &HT;    + And a special lifetime-achievement award for the Three
Stooges, especially the late Larry Fine, whose popeyed comic
stylings rivaled those of Chaplin and Keaton.
 &HT;    Let the arguments begin!

WHY SO SAD? IT COULD BE SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Winter blues.'' ``Winter blahs.'' ``Cabin
fever.''
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever lived where it gets cold and snowy during the
winter, where the ration of daylight dwindles to eight hours or
less a day for months at a time, where blizzards snow you in for
days, you've probably heard those terms.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another, more scientific name: seasonal affective
disorder, first recognized nearly 15 years ago by a pioneering
psychiatrist who theorized that the amount of light striking a
human's eyes has a lot to do with winter moods.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, SAD has become the subject of research at 22 centers
worldwide, where new treatments are being developed.
</P>
<P>
   So what has this got to do with us in sunny Southern California?
A lot, especially when storm after storm blows in off the Pacific
or zooms down from Alaska, bringing gray days and driving rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, with El Nino, there were days of heavy rains in
December and January, and I saw more cases (of SAD) last year than
any year before,'' said Dr. Joseph Haraszti, a Pasadena
psychiatrist. ``It seems when we had not seen the sun for a week,
my phone was ringing off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   SAD, which for many sufferers appears annually about the time
daylight-saving time signs off in the fall, is characterized by
depression, irritability, a craving for carbohydrates that results
in weight gain, withdrawal from others and a general tiredness, a
need each morning to crawl back under the covers for another few
minutes _ or hours _ of sleep.
</P>
<P>
   YES, IT'S REAL
</P>
<P>
   For most of us, winter's early sunset, which forces us to drive
home from work in the dark, is little more than a nuisance, leaving
us with a bit less energy, a tendency to go to bed a bit earlier at
night.
</P>
<P>
   But many people _ ranging from about 1 percent of the population
in Los Angeles to as many as 10 percent in Alaska _ really suffer
from SAD, said Jamie Rifkin, a researcher in the Winter Depression
Program at the New York State Psychiatric Institute at Columbia
University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles averages 245 at least partly sunny days a year, but
Anchorage residents glimpse the sun only 121 days. That lack of
sunlight, whether the result of a few stormy California days or
weeks of Alaskan blizzards, can plunge some people into an annual
depression that goes beyond just a case of the blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a clinically significant disorder,'' Rifkin said.
``Some people who have it can't get out of bed in the morning. They
sleep 10 to 14 hours a day. They can't go to work. People overeat
and can put on 20 or more pounds in the wintertime. It really
affects their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising that many people suffer as a result of light
deprivation, said Dr. David Avery, associate professor of
psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Washington Harborview Medical
Center in Seattle, who is researching treatments for SAD.
</P>
<P>
   Until the widespread use of home electric lighting, people
generally rose with the sun and went to bed with the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our modern world, we can get exposed to fairly bizarre
light cues compared to what our ancestors were used to,'' Avery
said. ``After all, it's probably unnatural to wake up two hours
before the sun comes up.''
</P>
<P>
   ONE WOMAN'S STORY
</P>
<P>
   Leslie O'Dowd of Pasadena, born and raised in Michigan, knows
what it's like when your body wants to sleep in the winter's dark,
but your alarm clock says it's time to get up and go to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've probably felt it my whole life, but I didn't know what it
was until just a few years ago,'' said O'Dowd, 43, a word processor
for a law firm. ``It gets worse as the days get shorter. I work in
a room with no windows, and on gray days I never see the sun.
Sometimes in the winter, I just want to pop out of my skin if I
don't see the sun for a few days.''
</P>
<P>
   As a young woman in snowy Michigan, ``I read a lot and slept a
lot and ate a lot _ I usually gained 20 pounds during the winter _
but I really didn't know there was anything wrong with me,'' O'Dowd
said. ``But I remember when the spring would start to show and the
sun would come out, I'd feel so much better.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only a couple of years ago, after a depression so deep
she'd been referred by her therapist to psychiatrist Haraszti, that
she learned the winter doldrums that had bedeviled her for years
had a name _ and that there was a treatment that would make her
feel better.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor immediately prescribed an anti-depressant medication
and up to a half-hour a day in front of a light box, a device that
emits bright, white fluorescent light, devoid of the ultraviolet
rays that cause wrinkles and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day I started treatment, I felt like I was getting warm
all over, like my body was trying to work again,'' O'Dowd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was kind of odd that you could sit under a light
20 minutes a day and it would help you. But it did.''
</P>
<P>
   RESEARCH SHED LIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Haraszti is one of a growing number of doctors who have begun to
heed the findings of Dr. Norman Rosenthal, head of the Clinical
Psychobiology Branch of the National Institute of Mental Health in
Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 15 years ago, when he first gave the ``winter blues'' a
name and suggested that frequent doses of bright light could help
lift the depression, Rosenthal found that women suffered from SAD
three times as often as men _ or, as with most depression, three
times as many women !ital!admitted!off! feeling sad and tired.
Those most affected ranged in age from 23 to 39, and the length of
their annual depressive episodes lasted an average of 4.9 months _
about the length of a gray winter season.
</P>
<P>
   Of SAD sufferers studied, 97 percent said they experienced
unwarranted sadness, 95 percent reported decreased activity, 87
percent were anxious, 72 percent said they craved carbohydrates,
and 66 percent reported an increased appetite. A total of 77
percent slept more, 64 percent reported decreased libido, 44
percent gained weight, and 61 percent of women reported increased
premenstrual mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   Many who suffer from SAD have relatives with the same seasonal
depression, leading to the possibility that a tendency to the
disorder is genetic, Rosenthal found.
</P>
<P>
   And, he wrote, ``while (SAD) occurs most commonly as a result of
the short, dark days of winter, it may also be due to dark indoor
working environments, unseasonable cloudy spells or ocular
difficulties ... For many patients with SAD, light therapy should
be regarded as a first-line treatment, given its high success and
acceptance rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily exposure to a light emitting 10,000 lux _ a measurement of
intensity roughly equivalent to sitting in front of a window on a
bright, summer day _ can lift SAD sufferers' moods within a week or
two, Rosenthal wrote.
</P>
<P>
   NEW TREATMENTS?
</P>
<P>
   Since Rosenthal's original studies, other researchers have
confirmed his findings and are working to find out why SAD affects
some people and not others, why some people respond to treatment
and some don't. They're also researching why light therapy seems to
be the best treatment and exploring other treatments that might
also benefit SAD sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   The most popularly accepted theory for why light helps alleviate
SAD is that sunlight striking the eye's retina affects the pineal
gland, which controls the body's production of melatonin, a hormone
that regulates mood and induces sleep. Artificial bright light
seems to reset the body's circadian rhythm _ its natural 24-hour
body clock _ to manufacture more energy-producing serotonin and
less sleep-inducing melatonin, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who advocate light therapy recommend that their patients
sit in front of a light box for varying periods of time, usually
early in the morning. They can simply bask in the light, use it as
a reading light, or work or eat breakfast while using the light.
Doctors recommend that users glance _ but not stare _ into the
light periodically so the rays penetrate the retina. Staring into
the light could cause eye damage, they warn.
</P>
<P>
   SAD sufferers who use light therapy usually notice a lifting of
mood within a week or two, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, Avery is pursuing another treatment for SAD. For the
past few winters, he's been working with ``dawn simulators,''
machines being sold as kinder, gentler alarm clocks that are
programmed to emit a light that grows gradually brighter during the
last few hours of sleep, providing an earlier ``dawn'' than nature
supplies during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the `dawn signal,' and you wake up earlier, more
rested, with more energy,'' said Avery, who uses one of the light
machines himself to ease into dark winter mornings. ``It works for
me. We're trying to see how many other people it affects that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the New York State Psychiatric Institute in New
York City are studying what may be another treatment for SAD:
bombarding the body with negative ions. Molecules of oxygen with an
extra electron, negative ions are created in nature by sunlight,
radiation and moving air and water; they neutralize odors and
contribute to the clean air and fresh smell typical of a drive
through the country.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the New York study, which is in the second of
four years of research, get their dose of negative ions from a
small bedside machine while they sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably too early to say'' whether negative ions work as
well as light therapy to alleviate SAD, said Rifkin, ``but it shows
promise. There's a lot of research left to do on treating this
disorder.''

home from work in the dark, is little more than a nuisance, leaving
us with a bit less energy, a tendency to go to bed a bit earlier at
night.
</P>
<P>
   But many people _ ranging from about 1 percent of the population
in Los Angeles to as many as 10 percent in Alaska _ really suffer
from SAD, said Jamie Rifkin, a researcher in the Winter Depression
Program at the New York State Psychiatric Institute at Columbia
University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles averages 245 at least partly sunny days a year, but
Anchorage residents glimpse the sun only 121 days. That lack of
sunlight, whether the result of a few stormy California days or
weeks of Alaskan blizzards, can plunge some people into an annual
depression that goes beyond just a case of the blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a clinically significant disorder,'' Rifkin said.
``Some people who have it can't get out of bed in the morning. They
sleep 10 to 14 hours a day. They can't go to work. People overeat
and can put on 20 or more pounds in the wintertime. It really
affects their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising that many people suffer as a result of light
deprivation, said Dr. David Avery, associate professor of
psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Washington Harborview Medical
Center in Seattle, who is researching treatments for SAD.
</P>
<P>
   Until the widespread use of home electric lighting, people
generally rose with the sun and went to bed with the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our modern world, we can get exposed to fairly bizarre
light cues compared to what our ancestors were used to,'' Avery
said. ``After all, it's probably unnatural to wake up two hours
before the sun comes up.''
</P>
<P>
   ONE WOMAN'S STORY
</P>
<P>
   Leslie O'Dowd of Pasadena, born and raised in Michigan, knows
what it's like when your body wants to sleep in the winter's dark,
but your alarm clock says it's time to get up and go to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've probably felt it my whole life, but I didn't know what it
was until just a few years ago,'' said O'Dowd, 43, a word processor
for a law firm. ``It gets worse as the days get shorter. I work in
a room with no windows, and on gray days I never see the sun.
Sometimes in the winter, I just want to pop out of my skin if I
don't see the sun for a few days.''
</P>
<P>
   As a young woman in snowy Michigan, ``I read a lot and slept a
lot and ate a lot _ I usually gained 20 pounds during the winter _
but I really didn't know there was anything wrong with me,'' O'Dowd
said. ``But I remember when the spring would start to show and the
sun would come out, I'd feel so much better.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only a couple of years ago, after a depression so deep
she'd been referred by her therapist to psychiatrist Haraszti, that
she learned the winter doldrums that had bedeviled her for years
had a name _ and that there was a treatment that would make her
feel better.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor immediately prescribed an anti-depressant medication
and up to a half-hour a day in front of a light box, a device that
emits bright, white fluorescent light, devoid of the ultraviolet
rays that cause wrinkles and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day I started treatment, I felt like I was getting warm
all over, like my body was trying to work again,'' O'Dowd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was kind of odd that you could sit under a light
20 minutes a day and it would help you. But it did.''
</P>
<P>
   RESEARCH SHED LIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Haraszti is one of a growing number of doctors who have begun to
heed the findings of Dr. Norman Rosenthal, head of the Clinical
Psychobiology Branch of the National Institute of Mental Health in
Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 15 years ago, when he first gave the ``winter blues'' a
name and suggested that frequent doses of bright light could help
lift the depression, Rosenthal found that women suffered from SAD
three times as often as men _ or, as with most depression, three
times as many women !ital!admitted!off! feeling sad and tired.
Those most affected ranged in age from 23 to 39, and the length of
their annual depressive episodes lasted an average of 4.9 months _
about the length of a gray winter season.
</P>
<P>
   Of SAD sufferers studied, 97 percent said they experienced
unwarranted sadness, 95 percent reported decreased activity, 87
percent were anxious, 72 percent said they craved carbohydrates,
and 66 percent reported an increased appetite. A total of 77
percent slept more, 64 percent reported decreased libido, 44
percent gained weight, and 61 percent of women reported increased
premenstrual mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   Many who suffer from SAD have relatives with the same seasonal
depression, leading to the possibility that a tendency to the
disorder is genetic, Rosenthal found.
</P>
<P>
   And, he wrote, ``while (SAD) occurs most commonly as a result of
the short, dark days of winter, it may also be due to dark indoor
working environments, unseasonable cloudy spells or ocular
difficulties ... For many patients with SAD, light therapy should
be regarded as a first-line treatment, given its high success and
acceptance rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily exposure to a light emitting 10,000 lux _ a measurement of
intensity roughly equivalent to sitting in front of a window on a
bright, summer day _ can lift SAD sufferers' moods within a week or
two, Rosenthal wrote.
</P>
<P>
   NEW TREATMENTS?
</P>
<P>
   Since Rosenthal's original studies, other researchers have
confirmed his findings and are working to find out why SAD affects
some people and not others, why some people respond to treatment
and some don't. They're also researching why light therapy seems to
be the best treatment and exploring other treatments that might
also benefit SAD sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   The most popularly accepted theory for why light helps alleviate
SAD is that sunlight striking the eye's retina affects the pineal
gland, which controls the body's production of melatonin, a hormone
that regulates mood and induces sleep. Artificial bright light
seems to reset the body's circadian rhythm _ its natural 24-hour
body clock _ to manufacture more energy-producing serotonin and
less sleep-inducing melatonin, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who advocate light therapy recommend that their patients
sit in front of a light box for varying periods of time, usually
early in the morning. They can simply bask in the light, use it as
a reading light, or work or eat breakfast while using the light.
Doctors recommend that users glance _ but not stare _ into the
light periodically so the rays penetrate the retina. Staring into
the light could cause eye damage, they warn.
</P>
<P>
   SAD sufferers who use light therapy usually notice a lifting of
mood within a week or two, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, Avery is pursuing another treatment for SAD. For the
past few winters, he's been working with ``dawn simulators,''
machines being sold as kinder, gentler alarm clocks that are
programmed to emit a light that grows gradually brighter during the
last few hours of sleep, providing an earlier ``dawn'' than nature
supplies during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the `dawn signal,' and you wake up earlier, more
rested, with more energy,'' said Avery, who uses one of the light
machines himself to ease into dark winter mornings. ``It works for
me. We're trying to see how many other people it affects that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the New York State Psychiatric Institute in New
York City are studying what may be another treatment for SAD:
bombarding the body with negative ions. Molecules of oxygen with an
extra electron, negative ions are created in nature by sunlight,
radiation and moving air and water; they neutralize odors and
contribute to the clean air and fresh smell typical of a drive
through the country.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the New York study, which is in the second of
four years of research, get their dose of negative ions from a
small bedside machine while they sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably too early to say'' whether negative ions work as
well as light therapy to alleviate SAD, said Rifkin, ``but it shows
promise. There's a lot of research left to do on treating this
disorder.''

R.E.M. FOLLOWS A DIFFERENT DRUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You pop the CD in the player and the first sound is a bleating,
synthesizer-based, ambient song called ``Airport Man.'' It pulses
and throbs. It has no obvious hooks. No acoustic guitar riffs. No
backbeat. Practically no vocalist. It's lo-fi electronica. A
snake-charmer of a song, it wouldn't seem out of place on Brian
Eno's ``Another Green World.''
</P>
<P>
   It begins R.E.M.'s 13th album of new studio material, its first
since the sudden retirement of drummer Bill Berry. And it sends a
signal: Something different is brewing here.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this record is,'' suggests singer Michael Stipe, ``is a
band mutating as quickly as possible, wanting to do better.''
Guitarist Peter Buck says he, Stipe, and bassist-keyboard-ist Mike
Mills figured the best way to kick off the album, ``Up,'' out
Tuesday, was to throw a slow curve at their fans. Right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like the track, but it's the least `song-like' thing
we've probably ever done,'' says Buck, who like Stipe, was speakng
a week ago from San Francisco. ``We literally invented the music in
maybe an hour. Michael just sang the first words off the top of his
head. It wasn't until we were mixing it that we thought, `Gee, this
is kind of appropriate' to start the album. I wanted people to
realize that they have to be in a different gear.''
</P>
<P>
   The tactic, Buck says with a slight laugh, is akin to one
employed by the Rolling Stones, when they blew off the career dust
with the hard-rocking ``Some Girls'' album in 1978, but made the
leadoff track the disco vamp of ``Miss You.''
</P>
<P>
   R.E.M.'s ``Up'' is not about hard rock and ``Airport Man'' isn't
disco. But the song suggests _ and the album bears out _ the notion
that at the mature, and often sedate, rock age of 18, R.E.M. is
entering un-chartered waters, perhaps, a new phase. ``If we're
going to give them an ulterior universe,'' says Stipe, ``we needed
to give them a door they can open.''
</P>
<P>
   First things first. Last year was the end of the world as R.E.M.
once knew it. They had the tunes for ``Up'' (plus many others all
written and ready to record) when Berry dropped his bombshell.
Unlike many bands that undergo a myriad of personnel changes,
R.E.M. had remained an intact foursome since its beginnings playing
bars in Athens, Ga. Mills had once said if any one player left the
group that would mark the end of R.E.M.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Everything changed''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It didn't quite work out that way. But, says Buck, ``with Bill
gone everything changed. New producer. New studio, basically a new
way of making records. You couldn't even really perform the songs.
You kind of had to layer them piece by piece. We're reinventing
ourselves. ... R.E.M. always prided ourselves on the fact the four
us could walk in a room play a song, walk out, and it'd sound like
a finished record. You know, no overdubs, no extra side musicians.
But we couldn't do that this time around. It was basically a drum
machine and a couple of people. Nobody had assigned roles. I'd play
a demo tape of my song and Mike would play one of his on acoustic
guitar. We'd walk into the stduio and there was 15 people, 20
guitars, 15 keyboards, 15 percussion instruments, vibes, stand-up
bass, banjos. And we go: `Well, how about synthesizer, banjo, bass,
bells.' OK, that's a good way to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to throw out every rule we ever had,'' adds Stipe.
``Everything we had ever learned about how to compose or arrange a
record. It really threw us into chaos. In a very real way it tore
us apart, as a band, as friends. I don't think any of us realized
how difficult it would be'' without him.
</P>
<P>
   Though stunned by his departure, Stipe says there's no animosity
between Berry and his former mates. ``I'm really happy for him,''
Stipe says, ``It was the most gracious thing he could possibly
do.'' (Berry's departure had nothing to do with the brain aneurysm
he suffered in 1995. It was just time to move on.) R.E.M. brought
in Beck drummer Joey Waronker and Barrett Martin, of Buck's side
band Tuatara, and formerly of Screaming Trees. Initially, R.E.M.
was planning on touring with one or the other. They opted not to
tour, but to do just a few television appearances and charity gigs.
They'll play both as a trio and in a full band, six-person lineup.
(This includes guitarist Scott McCaughey, plus Waronker and
guitarist Ken Stringfellow from the Posies.) They may play
spur-of-the-moment theater gigs next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like playing,'' says Buck, ``but I'm also writing a million
songs, so's Mike, and we're talking about where we want to go
musically next.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A melanacholic way
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Right now, R.E.M. is in a melanacholic way. ``Up'' is no big
bang, rock 'n' roll monster. Does that feel like a good place to be
right now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's what it is,'' says Stipe. ``Beyond that, I'm not
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   R.E.M. has always gone somewhat against the grain. ``Even when
we were more or less a bar band,'' says Buck, ``playing two sets a
night for people who wanted to dance and drink we were doing these
weird folk-rock songs. Literally, every club we played in the sound
guy would be like `What sound are you looking for? There's no lead
guitar, right? No Marshall amps, right? Everybody seems to sing a
lot. A three-part harmony, no lead guitar, playing through these
teeny amps. What's going on?' Our perception was: This is what we
think is right. The rest of the world is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   R.E.M. has spent its career cred-ibly moving from gentle
folk-rock to screaming hard rock. They were leaders of the
Americana indie rock movement during the early-mid 1980s, building
an audience bit by bit, moving up from clubs and theaters. They hit
the arena level in 1988 with the album, ``Green,'' and it is this
level at which they remain. (There may be a bit of consternation,
however, at their label Warner Bros. as the first album in an $80
million deal, ``New Adventures in Hi-Fi'' only sold a million-plus
copies in the US, down from the multiple platinum heights.)
</P>
<P>
   Generally, R.E.M. is a restless band, uninterested in
replicating the sound of a previous record. ``When we were doing
(the quiet) `Out of Time,''' says Buck, ``I was thinking `You know,
I'm never going to play electric guitar again. This is cool.' Then,
we get into `Monster' and I'm just like, `God, that acoustic band _
I don't really get why I did any of that.'''
</P>
<P>
   As they recorded the ``Up'' sessions, he says they realized
``there's essentially another whole album's worth of three-quarters
finished stuff that's maybe more aggressive and a lot more poppy.
But we started working on these songs (chosen) seriously and the
others held little interest for us.'' You can expect some out-takes
on B-sides or soundtracks, and, laughs Buck, ``that boxed set a
hundred years down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the songs on ``Up'' have a dreamscape quality about
them. No surprise, really, the name of the band is R.E.M. ``I never
liked the name,'' says Stipe, but our intentions were not to have a
name that put us in a category as some punk rock or new wave band
or whatever was going on in 1980. It really wasn't the name of us;
it was a name about the music.''
</P>
<P>
   The characters on ``Up'' often seem somewhat adrift, expressing
regret, feeling a need to apologize, hoping for another chance or
something to believe in. Stipe uses frequent watery images. ``I
think if you asked Michael,'' says Buck, ``he might say all the
characters might be confused or lost, but they are striving. Which
is a positive thing. I mean, nobody on the record has given up.
They might be in a world of their own, though. It's funny because
it wasn't until the record was finished and we were going through
the lyric sheets that we noticed the phrase `fall' or `falling
down' in most every song. Michael didn't even notice that when he
was writing it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really thought about it,'' says Stipe, when asked
about the themes of regret and apology. ``I don't know you, but it
sounds like you're looking at a mirror. People project onto songs
and it's why I think music is such a powerful medium. It's the
chance to project oneself onto someone else's stuff. I think,
certainly, thematically, the best R.E.M. stuff is about regret and
loss, memories and dreams. Where dream states and (real life) enter
each other. That's often a departure point for us. ... In a way, a
big way, the songs are smarter than I am.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ People who think they may be suffering from
seasonal affective disorder (SAD) should see their doctors to have
the diagnosis confirmed before dosing themselves with
over-the-counter remedies or light therapy, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms of SAD include depression, fatigue, irritability,
carbohydrate cravings, weight gain and withdrawal from others, with
most symptoms lasting the length of the dark winter.
</P>
<P>
   SAD patients for which light therapy is prescribed can generally
get a dose of sunshine in their doctor's office as often as the
doctor prescribes it _ daily, weekly or monthly. But for severe
sufferers who want to buy their own light box for daily at-home
treatments, a half-dozen or more companies can supply a variety of
lights. Prices range from $199 for a portable model sold by Apollo
Light Systems of Orem, Utah, (call 800-545-9667 to order) to $344
for a deluxe cherry-wood model made by Discovery Bay Lighting of
Seattle (call 206-246-2996 to order). &UR;

NEIL DIAMOND GOES HOLLOYWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As they say in the trade, Neil Diamond could sing the phone book
and still get a positive reaction. He's sold more than 110 million
records worldwide. His fans are an eager flock _ perhaps more so in
buying his concert tickets _ but they also are willing to indulge
his various out-of-left-field album projects. Diamond's last studio
album was the fine Nashville-based ``Tennessee Moon,'' for which he
was joined by guests Chet Atkins, Waylon Jennings, and Raul Malo of
the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   But Diamond has completely switched gears on his romantic new
record, ``The Movie Album: As Time Goes By.'' Due out Tuesday, it
leaves Nashville behind and probes the heart of Hollywood in a
double CD of famous movie songs, performed in the inimitable
drawling Diamond fashion. Amazingly, he's as comfortable with the
67-piece orchestra on this project as he was with the compact
rhythm sections that backed him in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of intrigued, because I hadn't done a full
orchestral album before,'' Diamond said recently from Los Angeles,
where he recorded the album with conductor Elmer Bernstein, whose
200-plus film credits include soundtracks for ``To Kill a
Mockingbird'' and ``The Age of Innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album consists of movie songs that are Diamond's
personal favorites. They include chestnuts such as ``Moon River''
(from ``Breakfast at Tiffany's''), ``As Time Goes By'' (from
``Casablanca''), and ``Puttin' On the Ritz'' (from the movie of the
same name). There are also more modern tunes such as the Beat-les'
``And I Love Her'' (from ``A Hard Day's Night''), the Elton John
hit ``Can You Feel the Love Tonight'' (from ``The Lion King''), and
the Celine Dion hit ``My Heart Will Go On'' from ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sang the male version. I gave it my own little twist,''
Diamond said of the ``Titanic'' blockbuster. ``It's a pretty song
and it's contemporary to what's happening now. I wanted both
classic and contemporary songs on the record.''
</P>
<P>
   The album is a prelude to a tour that starts this fall, but
won't hit Boston's FleetCenter until the spring. Diamond will
incorporate a half-dozen movie songs into the show, sandwiched
around obligatory pop hits such as ``Sweet Caroline,'' ``Cherry
Cherry,'' ``Cracklin' Rosie,'' ``Song Sung Blue,'' and ``I'm a
Believer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn, N.Y.-bred Diamond, now 57, hasn't toured in four
years, but can't wait to get back on the road. ``The tour will take
about a year and a half,'' he said. ``But we'll pace it and it will
be good. I just need it. (Touring) is pure. From my point of view,
it puts me on the mark. And I need to be put on the mark, so here I
go again.''
</P>
<P>
   He may take an orchestra with him for the spring leg of the
tour. While he'll tour this fall in his familiar,
theater-in-the-round format, he'll likely drop that in favor of a
traditional end-zone stage by spring. ``I like the in-the-round,
but I want to force myself into changing,'' he said. ``I might be
saying goodbye to it for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamond's creative restlessness is what keeps his fans coming
back year after year. So it's not surprising that, when asked about
his future recording plans, even Diamond doesn't know what he'll do
next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe a polka album,'' he said with a laugh. ``The fact is, I
don't have the vaguest idea. I just want to keep up my enthusiasm _
and I'm open to suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to keep mixing things up and learning,'' he said of his
albums. ``I learned a lot on (`The Movie Album') to throw myself
into the waters of the orchestra and become part of the ebb and
flow of the whole thing. It's a beautiful experience when that
happens. I hadn't experienced that. So here I am, 35 years after my
first hit, and it gives me hope that there are more beautiful
things I can record. But if you ask me what my plans are, all I can
say is that I'm going out on tour and sing and say hello to my
audience again and maybe they'll tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``The Movie Album,'' Diamond took a try-it suggestion from
his label, Columbia Records. The initial thought was to do only
Oscar-winning songs, but ``that evolved into personal favorites and
also movie songs in general,'' he said. ``The label was crazy
enough to let me do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamond's wide-ranging taste enables him to move from the Elvis
Presley-identified ``Can't Help Falling in Love'' (from ``Blue
Hawaii'') to songs associated with Frank Sinatra: ``I've Got You
Under My Skin'' (a Cole Porter tune from ``Born to Dance'') and
``One for My Baby'' (from ``Sky's the Limit''), penned by Johnny
Mercer and Harold Arlen. These two form what Diamond calls the
``Sinatra Suite'' on the album. ``The `Sinatra Suite' is a little
way of saying thank you to him,'' noted Diamond.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recording of this was exciting all the way,'' he said.
``It certainly wasn't laborious. It was over too fast.''

   Q. (italics)I have heard that all the stars we can see with the
naked eye, except for a few faint nebulae, are part of our own
galaxy. If that is so, why aren't the visible stars confined to the
Milky Way band?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. ``The filmy band of light that we perceive in the sky as the
Milky Way does contain the bulk of the stars in our galaxy,'' said
Joe Rao, lecturer at the Hayden Planetarium of the American Museum
of Natural History, but viewers on Earth have a clear view of some
individual neighbors, which are in a different part of the galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Earth is imbedded in one of the spiral arms of this galaxy,
about two-thirds of the way from its center to the far edge, he
explained. As a result, all the stars in Earth's general vicinity,
or at least those within a few thousand light-years, are seen
strewn all around the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   Any faint nebulae seen with the unaided eye are actually part of
Earth's home galaxy as well, Rao said. The naked-eye objects that
are outside the Milky Way are its two satellite galaxies, known as
the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, sometimes called Nebecula
Major and Nebecula Minor; the Andromeda Galaxy, and (in very dark
skies, for very sharp eyes) the Pinwheel Galaxy, M33, in the
constellation Triangulum.
</P>
<P>
   Early in this century, when the true nature of these objects was
unknown, they were referred to as ``spiral nebulae.'' &QL;

   Putting Pig Parts Into Human Bodies
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of infection by retroviruses is a hot topic,
given Ebola and AIDS, but virologists say the risk is very small.
Some people want to halt experiments _ but halt them until when?
It's almost impossible to identify a risk when you have no
experience of something. It's true that if the benefits are not
going to outweigh the risks, then any risk will be too great. But
60,000 people are waiting for organs in this country this year.
About 12,000 are waiting for livers, but only 4,000 will get them.
Even if everyone in the nation donated organs who could there
wouldn't be enough. Where else do we have a life and death
circumstance that's rationed? We can't create livers, hearts or
kidneys. That's the reason to move forward, but cautiously.

</P>
<P>
   I'm all for basic research in this field, but not human
research. Before that, we have to consider who is going to be put
at risk, and there's' no argument that this risk exists. The
danger, which nobody can quantify, is that a pig's infectious
particle will infect a human recipient, mutate and infect the
public in a way not unlike AIDS. The question then becomes an
ethical one: If the general population is to be put at risk,
shouldn't the population be informed about the risk and shouldn't
there be a way of getting public input on whether clinical trials
should go forward? We have suggested a moratorium on human trials
until we find a way to involve the public. Lab experiments are
fine, but don't impose risk on people to find out what the risk is.

<P>
   Japanese and American men walk and run differently because they
grow up wearing different kinds of shoes, research from Western
Michigan University in Kalamazoo suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese children traditionally wear flip-flop sandals when
they're learning to walk while Americans wear flexible-soled shoes.
Ko Tada, a Western Michigan graduate student now at the Hyogo
College of Medicine in Osaka, contends that makes the difference.
By measuring muscle contractions in the legs, she found that
Japanese men, even when barefoot, walked as if they were wearing
flip flops. ``The muscles for the Japanese pull the thigh back in a
braking motion that keeps the leg from swinging forward. If the leg
swung forward, the flip flop would become a projectile,'' said Dr.
Mary Dawson, a study co-author.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Japanese men tend to plant the entire foot down and
lean forward when they walk. American men strike the ground first
with the heel and stay upright, the results of ``a long history of
wearing shoes with flexible soles,'' Ms. Tada said.
</P>
<P>
   The differences extend to running, Ms. Tada said, and that may
explain why Japan has relatively few competitive runners.

   Now, British doctors report that male and female fetuses really
can affect mothers differently. Asthmatics carrying girls are more
likely to find the symptoms worsen, probably because of tiny
hormone changes, researchers suggested last month in the British
Medical Journal. One hormonal change occurs about midterm among
women carrying boys, said Dr. Heather Milburn, who studied 34
asthmatics. But what happens among girls' mothers is not known, she
said. Dr. Milburn said doctors had long noted the effect on
asthmatic moms: ``Roughly, a third get worse, a third get better
and a third stay the same. But researchers still aren't sure why.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Emil Skobeloff, who has studied women with asthma in
Philadelphia, said larger studies were needed to assess the
findings, because it was hard to tell whether female fetuses made
asthma worse, or male fetuses made it better.
</P>
<P>
   The American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology stresses
controlling asthma in pregnancy. It says inhaled medicine is
usually safe during pregnancy and suggests avoiding asthma triggers
like pets and pollen.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Arne H.W. Larsson's last billion heart beats have made him a
medical marvel, a pioneer in one of the great triumphs of
cardiology and electronic engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago this month, Larsson, now 83, became the world's
first recipient of an implanted cardiac pacemaker, a battery
powered device that electrically stimulated and regulated his
dangerous heart rhythms. Since then, Larsson has undergone 25
operations and procedures to replace pacemakers that failed for one
reason or another.
</P>
<P>
   Over those four decades, pacemakers have become smaller,
smarter, safer, more durable and versatile. And implanting the
device no longer requires chest surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Today, pacemakers function as microcomputers, detecting their
own malfunctions, and they are designed in different sizes and
forms to suit each patient. Many, like the one Larsson uses,
``pace'' only one of the heart's four chambers. But newer models
can pace two heart chambers. The costs range from $5,000 to
$11,000, depending on the complexity of the model.
</P>
<P>
   More than two million people, about half in the United States,
from newborns to centenarians, now use pacemakers. For many, like
Larsson, they have been lifesavers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I met Larsson and his wife, Else-Marie, in 1973, when he came
for a checkup at a hospital in Stockholm and renewed their
acquaintance during their recent visit to New York. Larsson, who
looks much the same, has sold his engineering business yet remains
active and often strolls along Stockholm's rocky shore.
</P>
<P>
   As a frequent traveler, he often speaks out about how pacemaker
users can lead normal lives. ``I forget I have a pacemaker,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, though, things were far different. Scarring from a
viral infection had disrupted the normal electrical circuit that
links the heart's chambers, and Larsson's heart could no longer
contract synchronously.
</P>
<P>
   This problem led to potentially fatal fainting spells, known as
Stokes-Adams attacks. During some periods, he had to be
resuscitated 20 to 30 times a day. For six months, he was confined
to bed at a Stockholm hospital, where he was given every drug and
therapy known. Nothing worked.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, only a few temporary pacemakers existed. But they were
large, stationary machines. Once patients were hooked up, their
worlds shrank to the distance covered by rolling tables and
extension cords. Plus, they were prone to life-threatening
infections along the wires that protruded through the skin.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Dr. Ake Senning, a heart surgeon, and Dr. Rune
Elmquist, an engineer at Elema-Schonander electronics company, were
trying to use then-new silicone transistors to build a pacemaker
that could be implanted in the body. Senning did not consider the
experimental device ready for human use. But with each fainting
spell, Mrs. Larsson pleaded, ``Make one.''
</P>
<P>
   Senning and D Elmquist rigged a device about the size of a thin
hockey puck, and Senning cut open Larsson's chest to implant it.
Eight hours later, it failed. In the middle of the night, Larsson
went back to the operating room where Senning put in the only
backup. The batteries had to be recharged every few hours, but the
pacemaker worked, on and off, for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was lucky that he had few attacks when the pacemaker didn't
work,'' Dr. Olof K. Edhag, a pacemaker expert who was one of
Larsson's doctors, said in a recent interview in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   Of Larsson's 26 pacemakers, the most durable lasted more than
six years, from October 1982 to January 1989. Larsson's current
pacemaker is a Pacesetter model implanted in 1996 and made by a
Swedish division of St. Jude Medical in St. Paul, which recently
brought Larsson on a promotional tour of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Pacemakers did not gain general acceptance in the United States
until the mid-1960s. Dr. Victor Parsonnet, an American pioneer in
pacemakers at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, recalled those
days in an interview, ``In the first 10 years, we were up all night
and weekends constantly operating to fix broken wires, leaking
batteries, exploding pacemakers, runaway devices, you name it.''
</P>
<P>
   Little by little, though, the technology improved. ``Wires don't
break much anymore,'' Parsonnet said. ``We never see a leak and
almost never see electronic failure. It is a different world.''
</P>
<P>
   But pacemakers still have risks.
</P>
<P>
   Serious infections occur in about one in 200 cases, usually
through contamination during implantation. About one in every
thousand recipients die.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 10 percent of the pacemakers implanted each year
must be removed because of infection, product failures or recalls.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Removal is risky, even with new laser devices, because the
pacemaker tip usually is imbedded in scar tissue and can easily
tear the heart as it is pulled out, Parsonnet and Edhag said.
</P>
<P>
   Household devices like microwaves and electric blankets
generally do not interfere with pacemakers, but cellular telephones
using new frequencies can reduce pacemaker reliability, according
to the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   Edhag, Parsonnet and other experts said they advise pacemaker
users not to carry a cellular phone in the breast pocket over the
device and to hold the phone over the ear farthest from the
pacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration said last month that in the
past 10 years it had received 44 reports of metal detectors at
airports and anti-theft systems at many supermarkets, shopping
malls and libraries interfering with the routine function of
pacemakers.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency said that doctors should warn pacemaker users
to be aware that many detectors are hidden in entrances and exits,
to keep a distance from them, and to ask security personnel to use
hand held scanners for only brief times or use other forms of
search.
</P>
<P>
   Developing a pacemaker was long a medical dream. In 1889, for
example, Dr. John McWilliam in Aberdeen, Scotland, suggested in the
British Medical Journal that repeated electrical stimulation might
be used to maintain the heart rhythm in patients with too slow a
heart beat. But practical devices had to await development of
transistors and modern electronics.
</P>
<P>
   In implanting a pacemaker, an insulated wire from the device is
threaded through a vein into a heart chamber. Stronger wires now
enable most pacemakers to be implanted beneath the skin below the
collar bone.
</P>
<P>
   Some women prefer the pacemaker to be implanted beneath the
breast against the rib cage, although such placement can interfere
with mammograms. Today pacemakers can be implanted under local
anesthesia by a trained doctor, not necessarily a surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest pacemakers were powered by mercury-zinc and
rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries. They often failed sooner
than expected, leading to the emergency replacement procedures that
kept Parsonnet and others operating at all hours. Some users died
because of battery failure.
</P>
<P>
   So the development in 1972 of long-lasting lithium batteries was
a boon. Now pacemakers can last from 2 to 10 years, depending on
type, and can be monitored by telephone for battery failure and
other glitches.
</P>
<P>
   Developing a way to prevent leakage of body fluids into the
pacemaker was another crucial advance in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 years ago, manufacturers introduced another major
product change: pacemakers that could sense the variable patterns
of the heart's electrical system and adjust to many body demands.
Newer models can automatically provide for a slower heart rate at
rest.
</P>
<P>
   Now dual chamber pacemakers are used in treating a common
abnormal heart rhythm known as atrial fibrillation. Studies are
under way to determine whether the devices can also prevent that
condition or moderate the symptoms of heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   In still another advance, pacemakers are being combined in one
unit with other devices such as defibrillators. In the past,
patients used two separate devices.
</P>
<P>
   The bewildering array of advances has greatly complicated the
task of caring for patients with pacemakers. Cardiologists have
formed subspecialty groups focusing on pacemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pacemakers began as appliances,'' said Parsonnet, ``but they
are becoming fully automated machines.'' &QL;

<P>
   As anyone who has tried to quit smoking knows, it is much easier
to get off an addictive drug than to stay off it. That applies to
virtually all addicts and all types of addictions, whether to
alcohol, cocaine, heroin, nicotine or amphetamines.
</P>
<P>
   Long after the drug is cleared from the body, it retains a
powerful hold on the mind, and despite weeks, months or sometimes
even years of abstinence, cravings can linger or suddenly make a
shattering comeback. The usual, devastating, consequence is
relapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prolonged drug use changes the brain in fundamental and
lasting ways,'' said Dr. Alan Leshner, Director of the National
Institute on Drug Abuse. Those long-term effects are not well
understood, Leshner said, and learning more about them might lead
to new treatments that offer lasting help to addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Help is certainly needed: The institute estimates that 4 million
Americans are drug addicts, including 2 to 3 million hooked on
cocaine and 800,000 on heroin. Millions more, though not addicted,
use illegal drugs, and 14 million are alcoholics.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with people who have other mental or physical
disorders, addicts have few treatments to choose from. No drug
treatment is available for cocaine addiction. Methadone helps some
heroin addicts, but by no means all, and two other drugs are useful
in only a minority of alcoholics.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, much addiction research has focused on the
reinforcing, or pleasure-producing properties of drugs, which have
been traced to their ability to flood certain parts of the brain
with dopamine, a substance that nerve cells use to communicate with
each other. But even though the rise and fall of dopamine can alter
brain cells in ways that contribute to craving, researchers do not
think those alterations explain all the long-term mental effects of
drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   And there has been no payoff in terms of treatment, in part
because the dopamine system is so fundamental to so many types of
pleasure that tampering with it to treat addiction might take all
the joy out of life.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the emphasis in addiction research has begun to
shift, to move beyond the dopamine pleasure centers to other
systems in the brain. ``We've learned a lot about reinforcement,''
said Dr. Eric J. Nestler, an addiction researcher at Yale
University. ``But there are other aspects to an addict's life also,
having to do with memory and conditioning. Maybe the time is ripe
to examine those.''
</P>
<P>
   Some changes in the brains of addicts resemble changes that take
place in healthy people when certain types of memories are formed.
In some cases, Nestler's research has shown, those changes even
include alterations in the functioning of genes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alcino Silva, who studies memory at the University of
California at Los Angeles, said, ``Addiction may hijack natural
systems used for learning and memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Addiction researchers have begun to pay particular attention to
``emotional memories,'' which, as the name suggests, are the mental
records of events that aroused intense emotions, either wonderful
or terrible. ``Emotional memories are very powerful, and they're
the ones that remain with you the longest,'' said Dr. Jonathan
Pollock, a program officer at the institute. ``You remember where
you were when Kennedy was assassinated or the Challenger disaster
happened. You remember very pleasurable events in your life, like
your wedding or the first time you got an A in school.''
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of the moment helps to burn emotional memories
into brain circuits. The memories are encoded into a part of the
brain that operates outside conscious control, and they seem to
take on a life of their own, sometimes intruding on the mind when
they are not wanted.
</P>
<P>
   When emotional memories are reactivated, touched off perhaps by
a smell, a taste, a snatch of music, the sight of an old friend or
some other signal that a person might not even be consciously aware
of, they can evoke the same powerful emotions that helped form
them.
</P>
<P>
   Many addiction researchers believe memories of being high on
drugs fall into this category of emotional memories, and contribute
to craving, compulsion and relapse.
</P>
<P>
   Although a relapse can occur for no apparent reason, many
addicts say that cravings are brought on by cues or reminders of
past drug use, like seeing a needle or crack pipe or visiting a
place where they used to get high. Stress can also rekindle
cravings.
</P>
<P>
   So, in many people, can just one hit of an addicting drug, even
after a long abstinence. The obsessive thoughts that follow,
Leshner said, are ``the very definition of an emotional memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Pollock invited 15 researchers to the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., to discuss the possible role
of emotional memory in addiction. He said it was the first time
that experts on addiction and experts on memory had been brought
together, and at the start of the meeting Leshner gave the
scientists a firm agenda: ``What I'm worried about is compulsion. I
only care about compulsion.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Much of the interest in emotional memory stems from studies by
Dr. Joseph LeDoux, a researcher at New York University. Working
with rats that have been trained by means of electrical shocks to
fear a certain sound _ a response that qualifies as an emotional
memory _ he has found that emotional memories are formed in the
amygdala, an almond-shaped structure deep within the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The job of the amygdala, LeDoux said, is to react instantly when
it detects a danger signal _ the sound, in the case of the rats _
sending out messages that prepare the body for fight or flight and
that create a state of fear.
</P>
<P>
   The human amygdala works in much the same way. It reacts in a
few thousandths of a second, independent of the cortex of the
brain, which means that people may respond to cues that they are
not consciously aware of.
</P>
<P>
   Although LeDoux has worked mainly on fear, that is not all the
amygdala mediates. It includes 13 areas, called nuclei, only two of
which are known to be involved in fear. The other areas may process
other types of emotional memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amygdala is showing up in a lot of addiction studies,''
LeDoux said.
</P>
<P>
   When addicts who say they are in the throes of a craving are
given brain scans, the images suggest that the amygdala is
involved, according to studies by Dr. Hans Breiter, of the
Massachusetts General Hospital, and Dr. Annarose Childress, of the
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers, working with animals, have also found that
the amygdala is important in responding to cues associated with
rewards like cocaine and food. Dr. Barry Everitt, a psychology
professor at the University of Cambridge in England, said that an
``amazing property'' of stimulant drugs like cocaine and
amphetamines is that they stimulate exceptionally powerful
responses to cues that have been associated with them. ``They
amplify the control of behavior by environmental events,'' Everitt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michaela Gallagher, of the Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore, suggested that drug abuse may also affect the cortex of
the brain, inhibiting a region that would normally help keep the
amygdala in check. That, she said, might make the amygdala extra
responsive to all sorts of environmental cues, including those
associated with drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors may also give cues more power to evoke emotional
memories, according to research by Dr. Jane Stewart, of Concordia
University in Montreal. One is stress, which increases levels in
the brain of a hormone called CRF, or corticotropin releasing
factor, that may act on the amygdala.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Stewart and her colleagues are showing that CRF, released
during stress, causes anxiety,'' Leshner said. ``Maybe CRF released
during abstinence exaggerates anxiety in addicts. We're going to
look at things that block CRF, to see if that will help. We haven't
tried it in humans yet, but it has been done in animals. It looks
good to me, and we're in negotiations with a pharmaceutical company
about it, and we'll run clinical trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Leshner said, he expected that treatment of
addiction would combine behavioral therapy and drugs that combat
craving and compulsion. Addicts may not be able to control their
cravings, but therapy may teach them to control the way they
respond to them.

INFANT HOMICIDE IS FOUND ON THE RISE IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Md.)   (af)  
 By SUSAN GILBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The number of infant homicides has increased to the point that a
baby is murdered practically every day in the United States,
according to the largest study on the subject. Though many
important details are sketchy, like who commits these crimes and
why, the study suggests how to protect babies at high risk.
</P>
<P>
   Based on analyses of the birth certificates of the nearly 35
million babies born in this country from 1983 to 1991 and the death
certificates of those who died before their first birthdays, the
researchers determined that 2,776 of the infants were homicide
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Homicide was the leading cause of death due to injury. The
infant homicide rate increased to 8.9 per 100,000 births in the
period from 1988 to 1991, up from 7.2 per 100,000 births in the
period from 1983 to 1987, the researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by epidemiologists at the National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development, is reported in the
current issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study is important for two reasons,'' said Dr. Lawrence
S. Wissow, a child psychiatrist at the Johns Hopkins University
School of Hygiene and Public Health whose editorial on the study
appears in the journal. ``Infant homicide is a subject we don't
know very much about. And because this is such a large data set,
the study brings the subject to public attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The two biggest risk factors, the study found, were having a
teen-age mother and, in particular, being a latter-born child of a
teen-age mother. These latter-born infants were 10 times as likely
to be killed as were infants in the lowest-risk group: firstborn
babies of mothers 25 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason we're seeing higher risk in second or later babies
is the added stress of taking care of more children,'' said Dr.
Mary D. Overpeck, the lead author.
</P>
<P>
   But Wissow noted that only about 17 percent of the victims had
the leading risk factors, indicating that other important risk
factors were still unidentified. He said some of the babies were
probably killed by mothers with postpartum depression or by
mothers, fathers or domestic partners with a history of domestic
violence. Most of the death certificates did not identify the
killer.
</P>
<P>
   But, Dr. Overpeck said, other studies have found that the killer
is usually either a parent or a stepparent. It is most often the
mother when the infant is a week old or less, and a male care giver
when the baby is older, she said. In her study, 5 percent of the
babies were killed the day they were born and half were killed by
the time they were 4 months old.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Overpeck said she did not know why the infant homicide rate
was increasing. ``It's possible that households are under more
stress because of more alcohol use and drugs,'' she said. ``Some
studies of nonfatal child abuse suggest that this is the case.''
She noted that the teen-age birth rate leveled off during the study
period.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no proven way to prevent infant homicide, Dr.
Overpeck said that having nurses visit pregnant teen-agers at home
regularly looked promising because it reduced the rate of nonfatal
abuse, as well as the number of latter-born infants, who are at
high risk.
</P>
<P>
   Wissow said another preventive measure was for obstetricians and
other health-care givers to identify more pregnant women with a
history of depression or domestic violence and to help them get the
treatment or protection they needed.

FONG DONATES MONEY TO STAUNCH CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LANCE WILLIAMS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Matt Fong, the Republican candidate for U.S.
Senate, donated $50,000 this year a conservative religious group
that lobbies lawmakers to outlaw abortion and block gay-rights
laws.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents on file with the Secretary of State,
Fong, who is locked in a tight race with Democratic incumbent
Barbara Boxer, made a $50,000 ``charitable donation'' to the Orange
County-based Traditional Values Coalition sometime before June 30,
using money left over from his successful 1994 campaign for state
treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition's chairman, the Rev. Louis Sheldon, is a
Presbyterian minister and self-styled ``lobbyist for the Lord.'' He
has likened abortion to murder and once advocated quarantining
people with AIDs in ``cities of refuge'' to prevent the spread of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   A Fong spokesman defended the donation, but it could undercut
the Republican's efforts to portray himself to pro-choice and gay
voters as a moderate on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon lobbies on issues important to religious conservatives:
opposition to abortion and civil rights for gays; promoting school
prayer; and tougher anti-obscenity laws.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon spearheaded a bare-knuckled campaign in the U.S. Senate
to scuttle the nomination of James Hormel, a gay philanthropist
from San Francisco, as ambassador to Luxembourg. Sheldon argued
Hormel's appointment would advance what he styles as an immoral
``homosexual agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Sheldon described Fong as an old friend and
said the $50,000 donation was used for work on a planned state
initiative to ban gay marriage in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone across the line who is conservative and pro-family,
Democrat and Republican, benefits from this $50,000,'' he said.
``It really was a pro-family donation.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong campaign spokesman Steve Schmidt described the donation as
``a disbursement to help TVC with their voter education efforts.''
He said Fong and Sheldon agree on many but not all political
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reverend Lou and Matt have been friends for a long time,'' he
said. ``You know, Reverend Lou fights in the political process for
his beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fights on the merits of his ideas,'' Schmidt said. ``And
those ideas, whether you agree or disagree with them, are an
important part of the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fong's hefty donation is significant because it runs counter
to the moderate stance he has adopted in the race against Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   In a television commercial, Fong tells voters that Boxer is
``not telling the truth'' when she accuses him of being
anti-abortion, declaring that he supports legal abortion in the
first three months of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   And in July, while the Hormel nomination was pending, Fong said
that he thought Senate Republicans ought to vote to confirm,
saying, ``I don't support the gay lifestyle, but I don't believe in
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Donating to the Traditional Values Coalition is at odds with
those views, according to critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lou Sheldon is one of the most right-wing, most extreme people
in the radical right world,'' said Michael Lux, vice president of
People for the American Way, a liberal advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Matt Fong is willing to become one of Sheldon's
top donors indicates to me that Fong is someone who is hiding his
true colors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Besen, spokesman for the National Gay and Lesbian Task
Force, called the coalition ``one of the most irrational and
mean-spirited anti-gay groups in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who would give an enormous sum of money to such a group
forfeits their right to claim they're moderate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To his critics, Sheldon responded: ``As my Orthodox Jewish
mother used to say, `Sticks and stones will break my bones, but
names can never hurt me.''' He contended his views on gay rights
and abortion are shared by most Californians.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon, a former Midwestern pastor and onetime aide to
televangelist Pat Robertson, Sheldon has emerged as an increasingly
influential lobbyist in Washington, skilled at identifying
hot-button issues for religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He led lobbying for the Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 measure
signed by President Clinton, that sought to prevent states from
legitimizing same-sex marriage. In 1997, he campaigned for a ban on
certain late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   This year Sheldon set out to torpedo Clinton's nomination of
Hormel, the first openly gay person ever tapped to be an
ambassador. Initially, religious conservatives sought to rally
opposition against Hormel simply because of his sexual orientation,
but the nominee's supporters argued that was sheer bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sheldon and his daughter, Andrea, reframed the debate into
a question of Hormel's moral fitness because the philanthropist had
endowed a gay and lesbian literature collection at the San
Francisco public library.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheldons sent all 100 senators thick briefing books
containing photocopies of raunchy magazines, including the bulletin
of the pedophilic North American Man Boy Love Association, that are
kept in the collection. The nomination died shortly after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what did him in,'' Sheldon said, ``the sexual
explicitness of the homosexual literature in his library that was
totally anti-Christian and pro-pedophilia.''

SIR, THAT'S NO MOOSE! THAT'S 2 RESEARCHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(With SCI-MOOSE-REBOUND) 
(mk) 
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only time Dr. Joel Berger feels silly about dressing up like
a moose is when tourists catch him in the act. Otherwise, it is
serious scientific work.
</P>
<P>
   Berger and his wife, Carol Cunningham, wanted to find out if the
near-extinction of big predators like wolves and grizzly bears in
the contiguous 48 states had wrought any changes in moose behavior.
One way, they figured, was to drop predator scents in the form of
wolf urine and bear scats near the moose and observe their
reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Easier said than done. Making the drops in known moose hangouts
and then watching from a distance was too imprecise; for instance,
one cannot tell with enough exactitude when a moose notices the
scent. To maintain sufficient control over the experiment, it is
necessary to drop the scent within five yards or so of the animal.
But although moose are generally docile and tolerant of humans,
there are limits to how closely they can be approached, and one
never knows when a given moose might get annoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Berger and Ms. Cunningham, biologists at the University of
Nevada at Reno who are also affiliated with New York's Wildlife
Conservation Society, tried throwing balls of dung and snowballs
saturated with urine in the direction of the moose (``This is
high-tech science,'' Berger said), but could not throw them far
enough. Slingshots did not work very well, either. ``We just
couldn't get the distance or the right slingshot to handle that
volume,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So the two scientists asked a designer who had worked on the
``Star Wars'' movies to make a moose suit. Like trick-or-treaters
or vaudeville actors, Berger and Ms. Cunningham got into the suit,
he in the front, in the pitching and data-recording position, Ms.
Cunningham in the back. What the moose thought can only be guessed,
but the tactic worked. The researchers were able to get close
enough to deliver their pungent experimental items, in at least one
instance going nose-to-nose with a live moose.
</P>
<P>
   Using this technique, the two scientists compared the reactions
of two moose populations to the scents. One was in Alaska, where
wolves and grizzlies still abounded, the other was in the Grand
Teton National Park in Wyoming, where no wolves and very few
grizzlies remained.
</P>
<P>
   The results seem clear: The Alaskan moose became wary, alert and
agitated in the presence of wolf urine. They would stop feeding and
look around for minutes at a time, and the hair on the backs of
their necks would sometimes rise. Bear dung provoked an even
stronger reaction; the moose ``freaked out, basically,'' Berger
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Teton moose appeared unfazed by the wolf urine and
reacted in a much less agitated fashion to bear scats than the
Alaskan moose had.
</P>
<P>
   In another phase of the research, the two researchers also found
that when predators are no longer in the picture, moose tend to
ignore the caw-caw of ravens. Where predators roam, ravens often
follow in hopes of picking up a quick scavenger's dinner, and moose
ordinarily would treat their calls as an alarm.
</P>
<P>
   All of these findings are preliminary, because the research is
still in progress. But Berger says it looks as if the near-wipeout
of wolves and grizzlies in the contiguous states has resulted in
changes in ``a suite of behaviors'' among moose. If so, that is one
more way in which humans, who are responsible for the predators'
disappearance, have altered the world of the moose.

CAN WORLD-CLASS ART COLLECTION COMPETE WITH VEGAS' TRADITIONAL
KITSCH?
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by SELLING VEGAS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ In one sense, the Bellagio resort looks like yet
another monument to the town's characteristic overindulgence and
sense of one-upsmanship. Still, you can't help but feel awed _ the
$1.6 billion, 36-story, 3,025-room resort towers over an 11-acre
man-made lake; the whole look is patterned after the village of
Bellagio on Italy's Lake Como. Picturesque Tuscan-style villas
representing some of the world's best-known luxury retailers and
gourmet restaurants line azure shores where thousands of fountains
dance to delight passers-by. The towering edifice even seems a
suitable home for what is arguably one of the finest art
collections in the United States: Bellagio mastermind Steve Wynn's
$300 million assemblage of impressionist, post-impressionist,
modern and postwar works.
</P>
<P>
   But just outside the dyed blue waters, beyond the chain-link and
``Authurized Personel (sic) Only'' signs, the Vegas Strip is choked
with honking, slow-moving traffic _ scores of rented Geo Metros and
wood-paneled station wagons with plates from Oregon and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   An unshaven fellow in a Camel Cigarettes tank top gazes at
Bellagio's tower for a moment, stubs out his smoke and remarks,
``Wow, that's big. Is that the MGM Grand?'' before strolling into
the Harley Davidson Cafe just down the block.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Strip, noisy construction continues on The Paris,
another internationally inspired monolith, complete with its own
miniature Eiffel Tower (still in the skeletal stage) and _
presumably _ an insulting waitstaff to complete the authentic
Parisian experience.
</P>
<P>
   Next door to ``Paris'' is one of the city's biggest eyesores _
ugly, antiquated Bally's Las Vegas with its coma-inducing
electronic signs hawking 25-cent draft beer and George Carlin
through the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Carlin who once mused, ``If a painting can be
forged well enough to fool experts, why is the original so
valuable?''
</P>
<P>
   That is a valid question for a place like Las Vegas and a venue
like the Bellagio, which intends to showcase very rare, very
valuable ``real art.'' After all, this city thrives on faux
re-creation. Why get real Egyptian sand in your shoes when you can
stay at the Luxor without sending off for a passport? Why get
mugged in the Big Apple when you can ride a roller coaster around
New York, New York? And why put up with the stench of the Italian
canals when you can sit in gondolas at the soon-to-open Venetian?
</P>
<P>
   ``The expressions of Las Vegas have always been ones of gambling
and in more recent times, ones of fantasy,'' says Alan Feldman,
vice president of public affairs for Mirage Resorts, Bellagio's
parent company. ``This time, we've gone after the reality of the
greatest vacation experience one can have. What would that be? What
if you could see some of the most extraordinary art in the world,
what if you could dine at some of the best restaurants, shop at
some of the best stores? And then you set that in this kind of
eclectic experience that is Las Vegas, and you have a completely
different environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Vegas vactioners still aren't quite sure what to make of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a mixing of high culture and ... not-so-high
culture,'' muses Fred Kuhr, a conventioneer visiting from Boston.
Sipping iced coffee at a nearby Starbucks (there's a Starbucks near
everything in Las Vegas now), Kuhr thinks Bellagio isn't a sure
bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a marketing standpoint, it seems that the people who come
here are coming for the gambling, for the buffets, for the sort of
over-the-top tackiness of it all and not for a museum of fine
art,'' he says. ``If people want to go to museums, they'll go to
New York or Chicago or Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   AN ARTS `MAGNET': Yet the approbation of experienced,
globe-hopping art connoisseurs is exactly what Wynn has in mind.
The Bellagio Gallery of Fine Arts will stay open from 9 a.m. to
midnight 365 days a year. While only 150-200 visitors can go
through the gallery each hour, that is cumulatively a lot of people
who'll choose to skip rolling dice for a gander at some paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody whines about taking all these objects to Las Vegas.
Well, everybody whined about Mr. Mellon taking all (his art)
objects to Pittsburgh,'' says Dave Hickey, professor of art
criticism and theory at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas and a
former art critic at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman says many of Bellagio's critics have wondered what the
so-called fanny-pack tourists could practically know of this art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have news for you,'' Feldman says. ``Stand outside the Art
Institute of Chicago, stand outside the Kimbell, stand outside
MoMA. See who's there. The self-defining aspect of art _ what makes
it great _ is that it appeals to people of all walks of life, not
just those who've gone to some small private educational
institution and studied art history.''
</P>
<P>
   Hickey, whose wife, Libby Lumpkin, serves as the Bellagio's
curator, thinks Las Vegas is ready for fine art in the same sense
Fort Worth once embraced masterworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vegas is a cowboy town, more like Fort Worth when Mr. Carter
and Mr. Kimbell were collecting their works rather than like Fort
Worth is now, which is pretty much of a Lutheran chapel,'' Hickey
says.
</P>
<P>
   Hickey is also responsible for bringing another Fort Worthian
aboard. Ted Pillsbury, former director of the Kimbell Art Museum,
has signed on as the Bellagio's ``consultative director.''

LAS VEGAS: ``consultative director.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pillsbury will help lay out a plan for the development of the
gallery, its use in the resort and its use as a community resource.
Although the gallery will charge a $10 entrance fee (most fine arts
museums around the country charge $3-$10), Pillsbury says the hotel
will have plenty of art on display in public areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a large group of paintings and ceramics by Picasso in
the Picasso restaurant,'' Pillsbury says. ``Two beautiful de
Koonings are on display as you come into reception (areas) for the
resort on either side of the check-in desk. There will be a big
Dale Chihuly _ a site-specific piece, a glass sculpture _ in the
lobby, and a big, beautiful Rauschenberg commissioned for one of
the restaurants next to the art gallery arrived today. In some of
the particular salons, there's a group of very fine Chinese Tang
and Han figures that will be on display. There will be art or
artifacts all over Bellagio. What's remarkable about the whole
undertaking is Mr. Wynn, as a fairly young collector, has really
gone after quality, and he's been willing to pay the necessary
premium to get things that are really world-class, museum-quality
objects. These are pilgrimage pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Hickey agrees that the quality of the Bellagio's collection will
prove an irresistible magnet to anyone interested in great art.
</P>
<P>
   ``If only one of these pictures, just de Kooning's `Police
Gazette,' were there, that would be a big deal,'' he says. ``And
there's close to 60 pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   SURREAL SPECTACLES: Finding an appropriate entertainment
attraction to accompany Bellagio's sophisticated variety of
elements proved easy enough. Mirage already had a relationship with
the international theatrical circus known as Cirque du Soleil _ the
troupe took up a permanent home in Mirage's Treasure Island hotel
in 1993 with its show ``Mystere.'' Since then, every glitz act on
the casino circuit has cranked out its own ``Cirque-inspired''
dog-and-pony shows, whether it's the Luxor's ``Imagine'' or MGM
Grand's dismal ``EFX,'' starring former Partridge Family member
David Cassidy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of the distinction of having artists and having
performers. We have artists,'' says Feldman of Mirage's involvement
with Cirque. ``The creative staff at Cirque du Soleil are artists.
They're not circus people. They are people who paint space with
form and shape and movement and color and sound and light ... using
bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the perfect complement to one of the country's
best collections of fine art. But in keeping with Vegas'
bigger-and-better image, Cirque du Soleil's new show for Bellagio
will pull out all the stops, but never the plug.
</P>
<P>
   ``O,'' taken from the French word for water (spelled ``eau''),
literally lives up to its name. Seventy-five divers, swimmers,
gymnasts, trapeze artists, acrobats, dancers, musicians and actors
from around the world will perform in, on and above a stage
consisting of 1.5 million gallons of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you start focusing on the tank, it's like focusing on
the frame of the picture,'' Feldman says. ``It's the notion of the
interplay of water, swimming, acrobats, fire, all in the
three-dimensional space. I mean, they're playing with the elements
of life right there in front of you. Another great Texan, Van
Cliburn, attended a rehearsal of ``O'' and leaned over to Steve and
said, `This is like being in a Salvador Dali painting.' And that is
absolutely the most perfect description of that show we can give.''
</P>
<P>
   CHEAP THRILLS APLENTY: While topless dancers and a $4.99 prime
rib will always have a home in Las Vegas, the folks at Bellagio
believe you've gotta start somewhere when you bring ``kul-cha'' to
the vacationing masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can create beautiful things and can enhance our
community as a byproduct of running our business, and if we can get
others to do the same, maybe even try to top us, that's great,''
Feldman says.
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury hopes Wynn's collection will cause ``a ripple effect''
sparking loan exhibitions from museums and prompting other casinos
to hop aboard the fine arts bandwagon _ Rio Suite Hotel &AMP; Casino is
already bringing ``Treasures of Russia'' in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's what Mr. Wynn had in mind in doing it,''
Pillsbury says.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Hickey is confident that Las Vegas' newest
collection of masterpieces has found the perfect home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the natural refuge for art in a country that
doesn't like art,'' he concludes.

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Selling Sin City has to be one of the easiest and most difficult
jobs in the world. Why easy? Las Vegas has a built-in reputation _
crowded casinos, gaudy shows, neon spectacle, giant hotel
complexes, cheap all-you-can-eat buffets. It's a tourist magnet.
</P>
<P>
   Why difficult? All of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, who can keep up? I visited Vegas in April and again in
October. On my second visit, the Strip was almost unrecognizable.
The Aladdin was razed, the Bellagio was raised and three new hotels
were already in various stages of completion _ including the $2
billion Venetian, set to open in April 1999 as the largest hotel in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas is a city in a constant state of reinventing itself.
Think of it as the Madonna of the Southwest. After years of
delighting in the naughty nickname ``Sin City'' _ winking at the
world while serving up high-stakes gambling, free drinks and
all-night parties _ some of the Vegas venues tried to shake their
adult playground image and sell themselves as ``family
destinations.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Steve Wynn's Bellagio and its much-ballyhooed
collection of museum-quality paintings and objets d'art, along with
the arrival of the ``Treasures of Russia'' exhibit at the Rio Suite
Hotel &AMP; Casino in November, Vegas hopes to widen its appeal to
adults. Kids are a secondary marketing concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is and always has been a certain portion of people who
bring their kids to Las Vegas, and the properties were wise to
create something for them,'' says Kevin Bagger, senior research
analyst for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``But
it's never been a primary focus. Orlando is no doubt a family
destination, but they also have adult attractions like Pleasure
Island, which Disney added almost as an afterthought. Las Vegas is
still primarily an adult-oriented destination, but there are family
options.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagger says Vegas' biggest shift has come in its reputation as a
gambling mecca.
</P>
<P>
   ``As all the new resorts have come online, they've diversified
their markets to make them more appealing to a greater number of
people, whether it's family or international or convention or
whatever,'' Bagger says. ``And in some of our research over the
past year, we've found that respondents are referring to Las Vegas
as more of an entertainment destination than a gaming
destination.''
</P>
<P>
   The addition of such things as the Forum Shops near Caesars
Palace and new shops at the Grand Canal at the Venetian has made
Vegas' shopping comparable to that of any major city in America,
Bagger says.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for dining, of course, the old perception of Las Vegas is
the $4.99 buffet, but it's more than that now,'' he continues.
``Every major-themed restaurant has a presence in Las Vegas. All of
the major properties have hired reputable chefs _ for example, the
Bellagio has hired on famous chefs from throughout the world. So
the overall experience of Las Vegas now is anything you really want
to do to have a full vacation experience. Gaming is just a facet of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, yeah, yeah. Vegas is fabulous. But can Wynn's little
gallery of pretty ``pitchures'' _ albeit a mighty impressive little
gallery _ really bring about an artistic renaissance in a city long
believed to be culturally challenged?
</P>
<P>
   ``Vegas is a visual place, you know,'' says Dave Hickey,
professor of art criticism and theory at the University of Nevada
at Las Vegas. ``The Rio is bringing in Russian treasures. I think
eventually \Rartist\S Red Grooms will come up here and do a piece.
Steven Molasky, who is a collector here in town who has been one of
Michael Heizer's supporters for many years, is building a space to
house all of the Heizers that he had bought and never fabricated
over the years. I think it's going to be great. I think that the
one thing you can say about Vegas is, things change.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagger says the new Las Vegas will attract tourists who would
never have considered coming before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people, perhaps, weren't attracted to what they perceived
Las Vegas to be, but now with this $300 million art gallery, with
the amenities of all the resorts and attractions, golf courses,
whatever it may be, Las Vegas has evolved and matured,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Bagger is paid to be giddily enthusiastic. But what
does the guy on the street think of Vegas' Bellagio-infused,
Pygmalion-esque transformation?
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why Vegas is successful at what it does is because
it's sort of thematically consistent _ you know, all the casinos,
all the buffets, it's a play land for that kind of entertainment,''
says Fred Kuhr, a conventiongoer from Boston. ``But if more of what
Bellagio is doing springs up around it, and springs up quickly
enough, then you could have this sort of secondary theme park _ a
sort of high-art theme park.''

ANOTHER BUSH POISED TO JOIN FAMILY DYNASTY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SUN CITY CENTER, Fla. _ Jeb Bush came to Florida almost 20 years
ago with two goals: to get rich and escape his father's shadow. He
achieved the first goal without much trouble. He's still working on
the second.
</P>
<P>
   As the front-runner to become Florida's next governor, Bush is
ready to join a family dynasty that may soon rank with the
Kennedys, the Roosevelts and the Rockefellers in the genealogy of
American politics. His grandfather was a U.S. senator. His father
is a former president. His brother is governor of Texas and a
likely presidential candidate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   With Gov. George W. Bush cruising to re-election, the Bush
brothers are poised to become the first gubernatorial siblings
since the late 1960s, when Nelson and Winthrop Rockefeller presided
over New York and Arkansas, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about it in that context,'' Jeb Bush said as he
campaigned in the sticky Florida heat last week. ``I'm just so
proud of my brother, and I'd like to serve here.''
</P>
<P>
   Dual Bush victories on Nov. 3 would put the brothers in charge
of two of the nation's largest and fastest-growing states. It would
also give George W. Bush a well-placed ally in any White House bid.
Jeb Bush is ready to help, if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he's going to run or not,'' Jeb Bush said of
his brother. ``I want him to run. I think he'd be great.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Jeb Bush is focused on his own campaign. Polls
show him leading his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay,
but Bush has been favored to win before. In his first race for
governor four years ago, Bush's early lead in the polls evaporated
by Election Day. He lost to Democrat Lawton Chiles.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a replay, Jeb Bush has adopted his brother's formula
for reaching beyond the conservative Republican base. The
hard-edged conservatism that alienated moderate and independent
voters four years ago has virtually disappeared, replaced by
promises to help elderly and disadvantaged Floridians.
</P>
<P>
   ``His brother's methods work much better. He's reaching out to
groups that he basically dismissed before,'' said Bill Hulbary, a
political science professor at the University of South Florida in
Tampa. ``It's the difference between night and day. If I were
putting money on this, I would not put a penny on MacKay.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent campaign stop before about 500 mostly elderly voters
in Sun City Center, a retirement community south of Tampa, Jeb Bush
brought out his secret weapon: his white-haired mother. A few dozen
retirees drove to the outdoor event in their golf carts, applauding
Barbara Bush from the padded comfort of vehicles decorated with
souvenir license plates from their home states in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the political times, the former first lady said she
planned to return to Texas later in the day to vote for her other
son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vote early _ and then vote often,'' she told the crowd.
``That's what we do in Texas.'' The candidate winced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't vote more than once,'' Jeb Bush said, feigning
exasperation. ``This early and often thing may work in Texas, but
only once here.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the Florida Bush is more Texan than his brother.
While brother George W. was born in New Haven, Conn., and attended
Yale University, Jeb was born in Midland and attended the
University of Texas at Austin. With a seven-year age difference _
George is 52, Jeb is 45 _ the two were not particularly close as
children.
</P>
<P>
   A sister who was born between them died of leukemia at age 3.
Three other siblings _ Neil, Marvin and Doro _ came later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Jeb Bush, whose formal name is John Ellis Bush, married
Columba Garnica Gallo of Leon, Mexico. The two met as teen-agers,
when Bush was in Mexico for a high school Spanish-language program.
</P>
<P>
   They usually converse in Spanish, and all of their three
children are bilingual. They moved to Miami in the early 1980s to
seek their fortune in South Florida's booming commercial real
estate market.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush, who calls himself a ``multicultural Republican,'' is
well-equipped to expand his Hispanic support far beyond Florida's
staunchly Republican Cuban community. During a tour of an Orlando
Coca-Cola plant, a Spanish-speaking worker asked Bush about the
influx of Hispanic immigrants to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, my wife is from Mexico. My children are Hispanic,''
Bush replied in Spanish. After praising the value of diversity, he
also offered a caution. ``We live in a place where we have hyphens,
too many hyphens,'' he said. ``There's the danger. I'm all for
diversity, but I'm for diversity that says here are the things we
have in common.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his brother, Jeb Bush seems to relish one-on-one
campaigning. At times, his buoyant attitude borders on flippant. At
a Winter Park elementary school, Bush sat down with a skeptical
group of teachers to discuss their concerns about his private
school voucher plan.
</P>
<P>
   He opened the conversation by flashing a ``V'' sign with his
fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what this means?'' he asked. ``V for victory. V for
vouchers. Or, it could be Julius Caesar ordering five beers.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the teachers' reaction, Roman numerals are not part
of the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   In another echo of his brother, Jeb Bush acknowledges regrets
about some of his past behavior, but says he learned from his
mistakes. George W. Bush's signature line on the topic is that he
was ``young and irresponsible when he was young and
irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush answered with a laugh when asked if he, too, was
irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently not as irresponsible as George was,'' he said
jokingly. ``But enough to be able to speak with certainty when my
children have been young and irresponsible about what it's like.''
</P>
<P>
   Although both of the Bush brothers want to establish their own
political legacy, they are fiercely proud of their parents, and
they don't hesitate to let people know it. In a fourth-grade class,
a student asked Jeb Bush if he hoped to follow in his father's
footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not really. I want to be governor, and I want to exhaust
every ounce of energy being governor,'' he said. ``My dad's my role
model in a lot of ways, but on the important stuff. In my own
personal life, my dad's kind of my beacon. I could never match all
the things he's done. He's the most incredible man I've ever met in
my life.''

PERSONAL HEALTH: THE RIGHT TECHNIQUE TO WARD OFF OVERUSE INJURIES
IN WORKOUTS

603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.) 
(JT) 
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Overuse injuries happen to the very best of athletes. Just 16
days before this year's U.S. Open golf tournament, Tiger Woods was
forced to take a break from golf for a week to let a sore back
heal. Soon after, during the U.S. Open semifinal tennis match, Pete
Sampras was hobbled by a strained muscle in his thigh.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of us amateurs on the playing fields, walking and
running paths, and in swimming pools and weight rooms, overuse
injuries are all too often the consequence of poor technique or
misalignment of body parts. A recent issue of the Penn State Sports
Medicine Newsletter pointed out that ``an injury caused by moving
the body the wrong way over a period of time presents athletes with
two problems. First, they have to recover from the injury. Then
they have to retrain themselves so that it won't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a better approach: To minimize the risk of
injuries, learn how to perform your chosen activities correctly
from the beginning and have your technique monitored periodically
by an expert to be sure you haven't lapsed into body-damaging form.
Although it is not possible in the space of this column to describe
injury-provoking errors for all sports, several popular activities
account for common problems.
</P>
<P>
   TENNIS _ The elbow is the tennis player's Achilles' heel. Tennis
elbow, a form of tendinitis, results from repeated vibrations
through the playing arm whenever the ball hits the racquet. The
usual cause: improper stroking of the backhand _ leading with the
elbow and using just the upper body to hit the ball. In a proper
backhand, the elbow is in line with the racquet hand, and the
muscles of the feet, legs, hips, shoulders, arms and hands
participate in the stroke and contribute to its power and
placement.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State University experts cite two ways to fix a backhand.
One is to use a grip that permits the inside of the thumb, not its
bottom part, to stay in contact with the handle and allow the elbow
to drop down and away from the body as you stroke. The second is to
use a two-handed backhand, which forces the trunk and arms to move
together and involves no movement at the elbows.
</P>
<P>
   SWIMMING _ Among swimmers, the shoulders are most likely to take
a beating. Many swimmers use strokes that put their shoulders at
risk of tendinitis. Pete Brown, the swim coach at Penn State, said
the usual victims fail to keep their elbows high in relation to
their hands and, instead of rotating the shoulder to get ``over the
stroke,'' they press downward too soon, which puts excess pressure
on the shoulder. In a proper stroke when swimming the crawl, the
elbow should be bent 90 degrees as the hand passes the face and, as
if reaching over a barrel, the shoulder remains high while the hand
is driven deep into the water.
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING AND WALKING _ My knees took a beating both running and
walking until I found a walking partner who teaches movement. She
repeatedly reminds me to lift the weight off the knees by raising
the torso like a dancer and keeping the knees and feet in
alignment. But many runners and walkers are cursed with a built-in
mechanical flaw: too much or too little pronation. In
overpronation, the foot rolls inward too far after the heel strikes
the ground. In underpronation, the foot doesn't roll over far
enough. Thus, only one runner in four has a normal gait.
Overpronation is the more serious problem because muscles from the
toes to the hips are called upon to stabilize the feet. It can
cause excessive torque of the knees and contributes to problems
like tendinitis, plantar fasciitis and knee strain.
</P>
<P>
   The usual solution is to use orthotics, shoe inserts that
compensate for flat feet and other common causes of overpronation
and enable the foot to absorb shock without becoming unstable. It
is best to consult a podiatrist or orthopedic surgeon about the
best kind of orthotic for your feet. Also, be sure your running and
walking shoes have adequate support, reinforced heel counters and
motion control features. For detailed advice, see Runner's World
magazine's shoe issue.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   WEIGHT TRAINING _ With this activity, ``any technique that does
not allow the body to move in a biomechanically efficient way is
potentially dangerous,'' says Dr. William Kraemer, associate editor
of the Penn State newsletter. He cited as an example ``cheat
curls,'' explaining that some lifters doing bicep curls with free
weights use their back muscles to lift the weight instead of only
the muscles of their arms. This causes them to rock or swing the
body back when they lift, which can result in lower back injuries.
To do it properly, the head is up and facing forward, the torso
erect, upper arms still and elbows close to the body.
</P>
<P>
   In doing leg presses, a common error is to quickly extend the
legs and lock the knees. With correct technique, the leg is
extended slowly and the motion is stopped before the knee is
straight.
</P>
<P>
   GOLF _ In this sport, where strokes involve twisting at the
hips, the lower back is most likely to suffer. When driving the
ball, low-back pain is often caused by a side-to-side tilting of
the body during the swing. A more upright stance and swing
minimizes the twisting motion and resulting ``crunch'' on the
spine. On the other hand, many golfers fail to rotate their hips at
all during the backswing and instead generate power by sliding
their hips back and then forward. This places the spine in a
vulnerable position when the twisting motion occurs later in the
swing. Keith Kennedy, a fitness professional for the Ladies
Professional Golf Association, suggests that the risk of injury can
be lessened if the hips are rotated instead of sliding them back
and forth when transferring body weight during the swing.
</P>
<P>
   CYCLING _ Most recreational cyclists worry about sore seats. But
a more serious problem involves the hands, in particular the ulnar
nerve that lies in the outer base of the hand below the pinky
finger. This nerve can become irritated when the handlebars are
gripped too tightly for too long, resulting in tingling, numbness
and weakness that can travel up to the elbow. Wearing padded riding
gloves helps but is not always enough. A better approach is
frequently changing hand positions on the handlebars, loosening the
grip and riding with elbows unlocked.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no matter what sports you do, it makes sense to do
both warm-up and stretching exercises beforehand and to repeat the
stretches afterward. And if you haven't done an activity in a
while, don't try to resume it immediately at full tilt. Build up
gradually. Finally, if you start to feel discomfort associated with
an activity, don't ignore it. When an injury is untreated or
aggravated by continued misuse, you can end up with a long-lasting
problem that may force you to abandon the activity altogether.

   GERMANY _ When Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder is sworn in
Oct. 27, Germany officially begins a new era. The new government, a
coalition in which key posts will be held by former leaders of the
environmental and pacifist movements of the 1970s, is younger, more
female and in many ways more diverse than the administration of
Helmut Kohl, who held power for 16 years. But Schroeder and his
government face many challenges, not least in the new Europe Kohl

   GREENVILLE, Maine _ Wolves in the wild are mostly phantoms that
shy away from humans as if they were poison. Pronghorn antelopes
are so nervous that if one looks at them the wrong way they are off
like a shot. And short of tracking down a mountain lion with dogs,
it is all but impossible to see one.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, no one has to sneak up on a moose.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, for instance, three people set out by canoe onto a
small pond northeast of here. As paddles bit into the water's
dead-calm surface, rings rippled across a mirror image of the reds,
russets, oranges and yellows spangling the autumn mountains. In the
middle of this panorama, up to his hocks in water, stood a creature
that Ed Mathieu, a northwoods guide in the canoe's stern, has
nicknamed the Goat Moose.
</P>
<P>
   There are moose and then there are moose. Some stand tall and
magnificent, proudly showing off six-foot-wide racks of antlers.
Others are like the scrawny specimen that wandered through the
streets of a small Alaskan town every week in the television show
``Northern Exposure.'' This one, too young to sport full antlers,
displayed only two small, curved spikes that together with his
characteristic moose ``beard,'' or bell, made him look, somewhat
foolish, like a big, stocky goat.
</P>
<P>
   Far from spooking when the canoe approached, this moose regarded
his visitors placidly. ``Oh, OK,'' he seemed to say, ``you're not
wolves.'' Then he resumed chomping vegetation from the pond bottom,
as weeds streamed from his adolescent antlers and water poured off
his head, neck and sad-sack face.
</P>
<P>
   Moose and people in North America have become bound together in
a new ecological dynamic, a relationship unknown since both species
migrated to the continent from Siberia some time in the last ice
age, which ended about 10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of this century, moose had been all but wiped out in
much of their range by hunting and by conversion of their forest
habitat to farms. Now hunting is tightly controlled and many of the
farms have reverted to forest.
</P>
<P>
   Natural predators like wolves have been eliminated from much of
the north woods. And perhaps most important, especially hereabouts,
industrial-scale logging has converted great stretches of the woods
to young second-growth forest, whose abundance of tender leaves and
twigs at just the right height for a moose to eat has created a
vast smorgasbord. Almost within sight of the Goat Moose, for
instance, recovering cookie-cutter clear-cuts had set a bounteous
table.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a population explosion among moose. Today
probably a million of the big hoofed animals inhabit the northern
tier of North America, roughly triple the population at the end of
World War II. In the northeastern United States, the population has
radiated out from its epicenter in northern Maine, where moose
numbers have risen to an estimated 30,000 from about 2,000 a
century ago, into central and southern New England. A lone bull has
even been sighted near the Delaware Water Gap in Eastern
Pennsylvania. Earlier this year, a moose was struck and killed by a
vehicle on Interstate 95 near New Haven, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, accidents involving cars and moose have become common
in areas, like Maine, where lots of people live near a forest. The
accidents are frequently catastrophic, more so than a typical
deer-car encounter. Because a moose is so tall and heavy, its body
can easily crush a car when the animal's legs are knocked out from
under it.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, moose have become a major tourist attraction
and economic asset. Like the Goat Moose, most moose are
``incredibly cooperative about letting people watch them,'' said
Karen Morris, a wildlife biologist for the state of Maine. Moose
``safaris'' have become highly popular in Maine, and Mathieu this
year has guided more than a hundred parties of people eager to see
this majestic yet ungainly and vaguely comical creature.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you not love an animal that looks like a moose?''
said Dr. Charles C. Schwartz, a wildlife biologist who until
recently studied moose in Alaska. Now director of the grizzly bear
program at Yellowstone National Park, he is an editor of ``Ecology
and Management of the North American Moose,'' published last year
by Smithsonian Institution Press.
</P>
<P>
   The look of the moose derives from the animal's marvelous
evolutionary adaptation to its environment _ the cold boreal
forests of the Northern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Its long legs enable it to fairly glide through the forest,
stepping easily over downed trees while predators pursuing it must
leap or go around.
</P>
<P>
   Its long, bulbous nose, lined on the inside with a wealth of
small blood vessels, is designed to warm sub-freezing air so that
it will not damage the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Its coat is one of nature's most superb insulators. It has two
layers: one a sort of underwool, the other made up of very long,
hollow guard hairs. Like a thermal pane in a window, the hollow
hairs block out cold air and conserve body heat. They also help the
animal swim (it can do so at a clip of about 5 miles an hour and
over distances of up to 9 miles).
</P>
<P>
   Moose take to the water largely because they cannot stand heat
(but also because aquatic vegetation is rich in minerals they
require). Winter temperatures of 40 degrees below zero seem to suit
them just fine. Even in their lighter summer coats, though, they
cannot abide temperatures above about 60 degrees. In their heavy
winter coats they become heat-stressed, panting with discomfort,
when the thermometer rises above about 23 degrees, and seek the
shade of evergreens.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   What a moose does for most of its life is eat _ a lot. A
thousand-pound adult consumes 25 pounds or even 50 pounds of
vegetation a day in the summer and 10 or 12 pounds of evergreen
branches or twigs in the winter. (Moose are partial to Christmas
trees, i.e., balsam fir.) One year, Schwartz said, it took a crew
of 10 people all summer to collect enough vegetation to feed four
moose for two weeks in a research project on moose digestion.
</P>
<P>
   In its constant search for food and security from predators, a
moose is served by only so-so eyesight. But its senses of smell and
hearing are acute. Its long ears move in an almost 360-degree arc,
helping the animal detect sounds far off. Moose ``are capable of
hearing sounds humans would be oblivious to,'' Schwartz said. He
has seen them perk up their ears and turn in a common direction, he
said, while he has heard nothing. ``Five minutes later, a vehicle
comes driving in.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet moose tend not to flee from much of anything. One reason,
experts say, is that _ at up to six feet at the shoulder and 1,500
pounds _ they are just bigger than most other objects in their
world. They have few natural enemies, and even against predators
like wolves they stand their ground; moving might prompt the
predator to attack, and in any case moose are formidable fighters.
Unfortunately, they also tend to stand their ground against
oncoming cars.
</P>
<P>
   In general, moose are considered the most docile of the deer
family, and the most tolerant of people's presence. But there are
exceptions. Douglas Kane, the state's regional biologist here, says
that mature bull moose hereabouts have become more skittish and
harder to see. ``When they smell a human, they're gone,'' he said.
It may be, he speculates, that bulls are shyer because they are the
primary quarry in Maine's short, one-week moose hunting season in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, any given moose can be dangerous, and all should be
approached cautiously and in some cases not at all, experts say.
There are two situations in which moose are especially dangerous:
when a human comes between a cow and its calf, and during the rut,
or mating season, from about mid-September to mid-October. That is
when bulls establish dominance, with intimidating displays and
sometimes clashes of antlers, and cows signal with moans and wails
that they are in the mood, a condition that normally lasts less
than a day.
</P>
<P>
   Anything or anyone invading a moose's turf then risks injury or
even death. More people are killed by moose, in fact, than by
grizzly bears, said Dr. Joel Berger, a biologist at the University
of Nevada at Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, though, moose have become so comfortable with people
that, like deer, they have started raiding gardens and crops in
some localities. ``A few of them in northern Maine are beginning to
understand the concept of broccoli,'' Ms. Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   When a moose calf is a year old, its mother drives it away (to
make way for the next year's calf) and it must find a new territory
of its own. Moose are now so numerous in northern New England that
the youngsters are being forced southward.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, a young moose cow apparently got lost while
searching out new territory and wound up in Boston. She led police
and state biologists on a frantic chase, at one point crashing
through the yards of row houses near Boston College. ``You could
hear the chain-link fences going down,'' said Dr. John McDonald, a
wildlife biologist for the state. Eventually the moose was
tranquilized and taken to a zoo, where she died; although moose
have sometimes been used as draft animals, they generally do not do
well in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   With a breeding population estimated at 200, moose are no longer
a novelty in Massachusetts. ``As they become more common,''
McDonald said, ``people report them less frequently. Once you've
seen your third or fourth moose, it's not a big deal any more.''
</P>
<P>
   In northern New England, and especially in Maine, moose-car
accidents have become epidemic. Besides being unintimidated by
vehicles, moose are drawn to roads because they love to lick up the
salt left over from deposits made by snow-clearance crews.
Sometimes they lie down in the roadway to do this, presenting an
unexpected traffic hazard. Another problem is that moose are dark
in color, sometimes almost black, and they are so tall that their
eyes do not shine in car lights. So at night, motorists often do
not see them until it is too late.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morris, the state biologist, said Maine averages more than
600 moose-car accidents a year. About 15 percent of the motorists
involved require medical treatment. And while Ms. Morris could not
cite human death statistics for Maine, she said the state's
mortality rate in moose-car accidents was probably about the same
as the rate measured in Sweden: about 1 in 400 accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The moose dies much more often.
</P>
<P>
   Some wildlife specialists in Maine favor loosening restrictions
on hunting to reduce the numbers of both moose and accidents.
Permits for the one-week October hunt are rationed; this year's cap
was 2,000. But other interests, mainly the tourist industry, want
to keep the number of moose high.
</P>
<P>
   New logging practices that rely less on clear-cutting and more
on selective removal of trees may well shrink the area of prime
moose habitat in future years, and as today's second-growth forests
grow out of the reach of moose their population may decline, Kane
said. ``It may be close to a stable herd now,'' he said, ``stable
or low growth.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the foreseeable future, the evolving new relationship
between people and moose seems likely to continue.

   &UR; SMOKIN' RABBIT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A rabbit one day managed to break free from the laboratory where
he had been born and brought up. As he scurried away from the
fencing of the compound, he felt grass under his little feet and
saw the dawn breaking for the first time in his life.
</P>
<P>
   `Wow, this is great,` he thought. It wasn't long before he came
to a hedge and after squeezing under it he saw a wonderful sight -
lots of other bunny rabbits, all free and nibbling at the lush
grass.
</P>
<P>
   `Hey,` he called. `I'm a rabbit from the laboratory and I've
just escaped. Are you wild rabbits?`
</P>
<P>
   `Yes. Come and join us,` they cried. Our friend hopped over to
them and started eating the grass. It tasted so good. `What else do
you wild rabbits do?` he asked.
</P>
<P>
   `Well,` one of them said. `You see that field there? It's got
carrots growing in it. We dig them up and eat them.` This, he
couldn't resist and he spent the next hour eating the most
succulent carrots. They were wonderful. Later, he asked them again,
`What else do you do?`
</P>
<P>
   `You see that field there? It's got lettuce growing in it. We
eat that as well.` The lettuce tasted just as good and he returned
a while later completely full.
</P>
<P>
   `It's fantastic out here in the world!` he told them.
</P>
<P>
   `So, are you going to live with us then?` one of them asked.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm sorry, I had a great time but I can't.` The wild rabbits
all stared at him, a bit surprised. `Why? We thought you liked it
here.`
</P>
<P>
   `I do,` our friend replied. `But I must get back to the lab. I'm
dying for a cigarette.`

   During a recent visit to our daughter and her family, my husband
and I were in charge of our three grandchildren for a day. At the
supper table that evening, the children decided to talk about what
they had done during the day. Twelve-year-old Samantha said that in
school they had discussed the possibility of the president's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's impeachment?'' asked 7-year-old Jake.
</P>
<P>
   Couching my reply in terms I thought he would understand, I
answered that when the president does something wrong, he is told
that he cannot be president any more.

   In a voice filled with disbelief, Jake exclaimed: ``You mean he
smoked?''

   The two teen-age girls were heading south from Fifth Avenue and
89th Street when one of them pointed to the Guggenheim Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that the one she went to?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said the second teen-ager, indicating the Metropolitan
Museum of Art. ``She went to that famous one. Can you believe it?
My sister gets one day off, and she goes to a museum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it,'' the first girl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just shoot me if I ever get like that,'' her friend said.

   Getting out late from my facial treatment, I hurried to hail a
taxi and planned to apply my makeup en route. When I realized that
I had forgotten to bring along a mirror, I asked the driver if he
had one. He said he didn't but that I could come up front and use
the rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   When I hesitated, he offered to turn the rearview mirror so that
I could use it when he stopped for red lights. We agreed, and at
the next light he stopped and turned the mirror for me to use. I
leaned forward and applied my makeup.
</P>
<P>
   When the light turned green, he readjusted the mirror and so we
continued the process until we arrived at my destination. I thanked
him, and when he looked at me to collect the fare, he said, ``It
did make a difference!''

   Beware of opera buffs offering directions. Walking on Broadway
at 68th Street, Carl Bowman overheard a young man asking a woman
for the location of Latraviata, a pizzeria where he was apparently
scheduled to meet someone. In true New York fashion, Bowman stood
by, ready to offer a second opinion, and when the woman said she
didn't know the location, Bowman spoke up _ Columbus Avenue, just
above 69th Street, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The young man took off at high speed. Bowman then realized that
Latraviata was just down the block. He had directed the man to the
Rigoletto pizzeria.

   I recently rushed down to the token booth at the Lexington
Avenue side of Grand Central Terminal, handed the clerk a $20 bill
and asked her to add $15 to my Metrocard. Then I raced through the
turnstile to catch the downtown train.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway to 14th Street, I realized I hadn't received the $5
change. What to do? Forget about it? Possibly, but why, I asked
myself. Go back later in the day? Right. Who would remember a
transaction of that morning?
</P>
<P>
   I decided to give customer service a shot. Turns out it was a
nice experience. The MTA was really going to try and get my money
back. But that is not the story.
</P>
<P>
   When I passed the token booth the next morning, I noticed the
same clerk on duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi,'' I said, wondering what my inquiry would evoke. ``You may
recall I forgot to take my $5 in change yesterday morning.'' I
never got a chance to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, I tried to call you, but you were already through the
turnstile and down the stairs,'' she said. She pushed a $5 bill
through the slot. ``Have a nice day,'' she said. I did.

   Leo Ladman's mother, in her late 80s, was fearful of crossing

   Then there is Sandy Rayburn's 78-year-old mother, who always
stoops to pick up pennies on the sidewalk, to be saved as ``good

the 26th Street Flea Market when, in a matter of minutes, she
spotted a penny, then another, then a dime and finally a nickel. A

she take the money. Her son wonders if she could be on to
something.

   &UR; SMOKIN' RABBIT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A rabbit one day managed to break free from the laboratory where
he had been born and brought up. As he scurried away from the
fencing of the compound, he felt grass under his little feet and
saw the dawn breaking for the first time in his life.
</P>
<P>
   `Wow, this is great,` he thought. It wasn't long before he came
to a hedge and after squeezing under it he saw a wonderful sight -
lots of other bunny rabbits, all free and nibbling at the lush
grass.
</P>
<P>
   `Hey,` he called. `I'm a rabbit from the laboratory and I've
just escaped. Are you wild rabbits?`
</P>
<P>
   `Yes. Come and join us,` they cried. Our friend hopped over to
them and started eating the grass. It tasted so good. `What else do
you wild rabbits do?` he asked.
</P>
<P>
   `Well,` one of them said. `You see that field there? It's got
carrots growing in it. We dig them up and eat them.` This, he
couldn't resist and he spent the next hour eating the most
succulent carrots. They were wonderful. Later, he asked them again,
`What else do you do?`
</P>
<P>
   `You see that field there? It's got lettuce growing in it. We
eat that as well.` The lettuce tasted just as good and he returned
a while later completely full.
</P>
<P>
   `It's fantastic out here in the world!` he told them.
</P>
<P>
   `So, are you going to live with us then?` one of them asked.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm sorry, I had a great time but I can't.` The wild rabbits
all stared at him, a bit surprised. `Why? We thought you liked it
here.`
</P>
<P>
   `I do,` our friend replied. `But I must get back to the lab. I'm
dying for a cigarette.`

   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM 'WEEKEND UPDATE' ON NBC's 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is doing some good things, you have to give it to him:
peace in Northern Ireland and the Middle East. I heard next he's
going over to Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown's house.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This week, President Clinton appointed John Podesta as his new
Chief of Staff. The President said he gave Podesta the job because
he hates him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Former White House spokesman Mike McCurry praised the
President, saying that he is a 'richly qualified leader,' but that
he was 'exasperatingly stupid in his personal life.' Translation:
he always goes for the ugly ones.''
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA announced that John Glenn would not participate in one
age-related test during his upcoming space flight. While Glenn has
agreed to be subjected to numerous tests, he put his foot down when
NASA wanted to perform an autopsy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Byron Looper, a Republican candidate for the state senate in
Tennessee, has been arrested for shooting his opponent dead. Today,
the NRA said, 'Are we endorsing this guy? Hell, yeah!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``In an issue of Mirabella magazine, Kenneth Starr's wife claims
that President Clinton is a sex addict. Clinton responded, 'Hey,
let me see that magazine. They've really got some hot women in
there.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists have developed a device that can be implanted in
the brain to allow a person to move a computer cursor by just
thinking about it. Bill Gates has ordered that all babies
manufactured after February 16, 2001, be fitted with this device.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The schoolboy who fathered two children with his jailed
teacher, Mary Kay Latourneau, made a dramatic plea to have her
released from prison this week. Not so easy to get a date in the
real world, is it, kid?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a debate over the effectiveness of these new 'Smart
Guns' that will only fire when a computer chip in the gun
recognizes the gun's owner. I don't trust that. Sometimes I have to
swipe my ATM card through the slot a couple times. I'd be like,
'Freeze -- wait, I forgot my pin number.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists want to study the DNA of a chimp and a human to
determine what genes make a human a human. They also want to study
what gene makes a monkey windsurfer so funny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Archaeologists in Jerusalem have uncovered a jug from Roman
times that contains 200-400 gold coins. Experts believe it may have
been Jesus' laundry money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Supermodel Naomi Campbell was slapped with an $8 million
damage suit for allegedly bashing her secretary's skull with a
telephone. Sources say Campbell could have saved nearly $2 million
on this incident if she had MCI.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier this week, the Nevada State Gaming Commission voted to
allow Mike Tyson to return to boxing. An important factor was
testimony on Tyson's behalf by Magic Johnson and Muhammad Ali. The
commission patiently listened as the once great athlete bravely
struggled to put even the simplest thought into words. Then, Ali
spoke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Spanish language TV station Telemundo is looking to remake
shows from the '70s and '80s like 'Starsky &AMP; Hutch,' 'Who's the
Boss,' and 'Charlie's Angels.' Come on, a Spanish 'Who's the Boss?'
It was hard enough to believe an Italian guy would live in a house
with a single woman without sex for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This week marks the Pope's 20th anniversary as the Pontiff.
When he opened his anniversary gifts, the Pope was overheard to
say, 'Wow, just what I needed, another cross.'''

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   During a recent visit to our daughter and her family, my husband
and I were in charge of our three grandchildren for a day. At the
supper table that evening, the children decided to talk about what
they had done during the day. Twelve-year-old Samantha said that in
school they had discussed the possibility of the president's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's impeachment?'' asked 7-year-old Jake.
</P>
<P>
   Couching my reply in terms I thought he would understand, I
answered that when the president does something wrong, he is told
that he cannot be president any more.
</P>
<P>
   In a voice filled with disbelief, Jake exclaimed: ``You mean he
smoked?''

   The two teen-age girls were heading south from Fifth Avenue and
89th Street when one of them pointed to the Guggenheim Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that the one she went to?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said the second teen-ager, indicating the Metropolitan
Museum of Art. ``She went to that famous one. Can you believe it?
My sister gets one day off, and she goes to a museum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it,'' the first girl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just shoot me if I ever get like that,'' her friend said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will,'' the first girl promised.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Chutorian Semler, who overheard the exchange, didn't know
whether to laugh or cry.
</P>
<P>
   Getting out late from my facial treatment, I hurried to hail a
taxi and planned to apply my makeup en route. When I realized that
I had forgotten to bring along a mirror, I asked the driver if he
had one. He said he didn't but that I could come up front and use
the rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   When I hesitated, he offered to turn the rearview mirror so that
I could use it when he stopped for red lights. We agreed, and at
the next light he stopped and turned the mirror for me to use. I
leaned forward and applied my makeup.
</P>
<P>
   When the light turned green, he readjusted the mirror and so we
continued the process until we arrived at my destination. I thanked
him, and when he looked at me to collect the fare, he said, ``It
did make a difference!''

   Scene: Early evening on an uptown train between 14th and 42nd
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Participants: A homeless man and a homeless woman, both familiar
to riders of the train.
</P>
<P>
   Observer: David M. Richman.
</P>
<P>
   Action: The homeless man is ready to tell his story of personal
woe. As he is about to begin, the homeless woman steps into the
car. They both stop, aware of each other's presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK,'' the homeless man says. ``The car is yours.''
</P>
<P>
   He passes by her and goes on to the next car. The woman proceeds
to tell her story.
</P>
<P>
   Moral: Chivalry lives in New York, in all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
   Beware of opera buffs offering directions. Walking on Broadway
at 68th Street, Carl Bowman overheard a young man asking a woman
for the location of Latraviata, a pizzeria where he was apparently
scheduled to meet someone. In true New York fashion, Bowman stood
by, ready to offer a second opinion, and when the woman said she
didn't know the location, Bowman spoke up _ Columbus Avenue, just
above 69th Street, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The young man took off at high speed. Bowman then realized that
Latraviata was just down the block. He had directed the man to the
Rigoletto pizzeria.
</P>
<P>
   I recently rushed down to the token booth at the Lexington
Avenue side of Grand Central Terminal, handed the clerk a $20 bill
and asked her to add $15 to my Metrocard. Then I raced through the
turnstile to catch the downtown train.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway to 14th Street, I realized I hadn't received the $5
change. What to do? Forget about it? Possibly, but why, I asked
myself. Go back later in the day? Right. Who would remember a
transaction of that morning?
</P>
<P>
   I decided to give customer service a shot. Turns out it was a
nice experience. The MTA was really going to try and get my money
back. But that is not the story.
</P>
<P>
   When I passed the token booth the next morning, I noticed the
same clerk on duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi,'' I said, wondering what my inquiry would evoke. ``You may
recall I forgot to take my $5 in change yesterday morning.'' I
never got a chance to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, I tried to call you, but you were already through the
turnstile and down the stairs,'' she said. She pushed a $5 bill
through the slot. ``Have a nice day,'' she said. I did.

   Adele S. Greene was browsing through Crate &AMP; Barrel with a
friend recently when she heard a child's voice behind her. ``Well,
Grandma,'' the voice said, ``it's always nice to talk to you.''
Curious, she turned around to see the enthusiastic youngster. What
she saw was a little girl about 3 years old, leaning back in her
stroller, chatting on a cellular phone. Why did Ms. Greene and her
friend feel old-fashioned?
</P>
<P>
   Karen DeCrow flew to Chicago earlier this month for the Art
Institute opening of the Mary Cassatt exhibit, ``Modern Woman.''
She was standing in front of the colorful painting ``Portrait of a
Lady,'' depicting Cassatt's mother reading Le Figaro with a pleased
expression on her face. Nearby were two women who appeared to be
both modern and prosperous. One said to the other, ``If she were
reading The Wall Street Journal, she wouldn't look so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Leo Ladman's mother, in her late 80s, was fearful of crossing
busy streets. One day she had to cross Fort Washington Avenue, and
the traffic was very heavy. ``Would you please help me?'' she asked
the man next to her. He gave her a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Sandy Rayburn's 78-year-old mother, who always
stoops to pick up pennies on the sidewalk, to be saved as ``good
fortune insurance.'' She was waiting to meet her son in front of
the 26th Street Flea Market when, in a matter of minutes, she
spotted a penny, then another, then a dime and finally a nickel. A
good Samaritan saw her picking up the coins and pressed three crisp
dollar bills into her hand, insisting, despite her demurral, that
she take the money. Her son wonders if she could be on to
something.

   Scene: Early evening on an uptown train between 14th and 42nd
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Participants: A homeless man and a homeless woman, both familiar
to riders of the train.
</P>
<P>
   Observer: David M. Richman.
</P>
<P>
   Action: The homeless man is ready to tell his story of personal
woe. As he is about to begin, the homeless woman steps into the
car. They both stop, aware of each other's presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK,'' the homeless man says. ``The car is yours.''
</P>
<P>
   He passes by her and goes on to the next car. The woman proceeds
to tell her story.
</P>
<P>
   Moral: Chivalry lives in New York, in all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
   Beware of opera buffs offering directions. Walking on Broadway
at 68th Street, Carl Bowman overheard a young man asking a woman
for the location of Latraviata, a pizzeria where he was apparently
scheduled to meet someone. In true New York fashion, Bowman stood
by, ready to offer a second opinion, and when the woman said she
didn't know the location, Bowman spoke up _ Columbus Avenue, just
above 69th Street, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The young man took off at high speed. Bowman then realized that
Latraviata was just down the block. He had directed the man to the
Rigoletto pizzeria.

   I recently rushed down to the token booth at the Lexington
Avenue side of Grand Central Terminal, handed the clerk a $20 bill
and asked her to add $15 to my Metrocard. Then I raced through the
turnstile to catch the downtown train.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway to 14th Street, I realized I hadn't received the $5
change. What to do? Forget about it? Possibly, but why, I asked
myself. Go back later in the day? Right. Who would remember a
transaction of that morning?
</P>
<P>
   I decided to give customer service a shot. Turns out it was a
nice experience. The MTA was really going to try and get my money
back. But that is not the story.
</P>
<P>
   When I passed the token booth the next morning, I noticed the
same clerk on duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi,'' I said, wondering what my inquiry would evoke. ``You may
recall I forgot to take my $5 in change yesterday morning.'' I
never got a chance to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, I tried to call you, but you were already through the
turnstile and down the stairs,'' she said. She pushed a $5 bill
through the slot. ``Have a nice day,'' she said. I did.

   Adele S. Greene was browsing through Crate &AMP; Barrel with a
friend recently when she heard a child's voice behind her. ``Well,
Grandma,'' the voice said, ``it's always nice to talk to you.''
Curious, she turned around to see the enthusiastic youngster. What
she saw was a little girl about 3 years old, leaning back in her
stroller, chatting on a cellular phone. Why did Ms. Greene and her
friend feel old-fashioned?
</P>
<P>
   Karen DeCrow flew to Chicago earlier this month for the Art
Institute opening of the Mary Cassatt exhibit, ``Modern Woman.''
She was standing in front of the colorful painting ``Portrait of a
Lady,'' depicting Cassatt's mother reading Le Figaro with a pleased
expression on her face. Nearby were two women who appeared to be
both modern and prosperous. One said to the other, ``If she were
reading The Wall Street Journal, she wouldn't look so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Leo Ladman's mother, in her late 80s, was fearful of crossing
busy streets. One day she had to cross Fort Washington Avenue, and
the traffic was very heavy. ``Would you please help me?'' she asked
the man next to her. He gave her a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Sandy Rayburn's 78-year-old mother, who always
stoops to pick up pennies on the sidewalk, to be saved as ``good
fortune insurance.'' She was waiting to meet her son in front of
the 26th Street Flea Market when, in a matter of minutes, she
spotted a penny, then another, then a dime and finally a nickel. A
good Samaritan saw her picking up the coins and pressed three crisp
dollar bills into her hand, insisting, despite her demurral, that
she take the money. Her son wonders if she could be on to
something.

   &UR; SMOKIN' RABBIT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A rabbit one day managed to break free from the laboratory where
he had been born and brought up. As he scurried away from the
fencing of the compound, he felt grass under his little feet and
saw the dawn breaking for the first time in his life.
</P>
<P>
   `Wow, this is great,` he thought. It wasn't long before he came
to a hedge and after squeezing under it he saw a wonderful sight -
lots of other bunny rabbits, all free and nibbling at the lush
grass.
</P>
<P>
   `Hey,` he called. `I'm a rabbit from the laboratory and I've
just escaped. Are you wild rabbits?`
</P>
<P>
   `Yes. Come and join us,` they cried. Our friend hopped over to
them and started eating the grass. It tasted so good. `What else do
you wild rabbits do?` he asked.
</P>
<P>
   `Well,` one of them said. `You see that field there? It's got
carrots growing in it. We dig them up and eat them.` This, he
couldn't resist and he spent the next hour eating the most
succulent carrots. They were wonderful. Later, he asked them again,
`What else do you do?`
</P>
<P>
   `You see that field there? It's got lettuce growing in it. We
eat that as well.` The lettuce tasted just as good and he returned
a while later completely full.
</P>
<P>
   `It's fantastic out here in the world!` he told them.
</P>
<P>
   `So, are you going to live with us then?` one of them asked.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm sorry, I had a great time but I can't.` The wild rabbits
all stared at him, a bit surprised. `Why? We thought you liked it
here.`
</P>
<P>
   `I do,` our friend replied. `But I must get back to the lab. I'm
dying for a cigarette.`

there.'''

   ``Scientists have developed a device that can be implanted in

manufactured after February 16, 2001, be fitted with this device.''
</P>

   ``The schoolboy who fathered two children with his jailed
teacher, Mary Kay Latourneau, made a dramatic plea to have her
released from prison this week. Not so easy to get a date in the
real world, is it, kid?''

<P>
   ``There is a debate over the effectiveness of these new 'Smart
Guns' that will only fire when a computer chip in the gun
recognizes the gun's owner. I don't trust that. Sometimes I have to
swipe my ATM card through the slot a couple times. I'd be like,
'Freeze -- wait, I forgot my pin number.'''

what gene makes a monkey windsurfer so funny.''

on this incident if she had MCI.''

   ``Earlier this week, the Nevada State Gaming Commission voted to

they had done during the day. Twelve-year-old Samantha said that in
school they had discussed the possibility of the president's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's impeachment?'' asked 7-year-old Jake.
</P>
<P>
   Couching my reply in terms I thought he would understand, I
answered that when the president does something wrong, he is told
that he cannot be president any more.

   In a voice filled with disbelief, Jake exclaimed: ``You mean he
smoked?''

   ``No,'' said the second teen-ager, indicating the Metropolitan
Museum of Art. ``She went to that famous one. Can you believe it?
My sister gets one day off, and she goes to a museum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it,'' the first girl said.
</P>

   ``Just shoot me if I ever get like that,'' her friend said.

   Tracy Chutorian Semler, who overheard the exchange, didn't know
whether to laugh or cry.

   Getting out late from my facial treatment, I hurried to hail a
taxi and planned to apply my makeup en route. When I realized that
I had forgotten to bring along a mirror, I asked the driver if he
had one. He said he didn't but that I could come up front and use
the rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   When I hesitated, he offered to turn the rearview mirror so that
I could use it when he stopped for red lights. We agreed, and at
the next light he stopped and turned the mirror for me to use. I
leaned forward and applied my makeup.
</P>
<P>
   When the light turned green, he readjusted the mirror and so we
continued the process until we arrived at my destination. I thanked
him, and when he looked at me to collect the fare, he said, ``It
did make a difference!''

HAPPINESS MAY GROW WITH AGING, STUDY FINDS

   Aging brings predictable travails: The body starts to crumble,
memory decays, old friends begin to fall ill and die. But a new
study indicates the passage of years may also bestow a heightened
sense of well-being, at least for the generation of Americans now
well into their retirement years.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel Mroczek of Fordham University and his colleague,
Christian Kolarz, analyzed the responses of more than 2,700 adults
between the ages of 25 and 74 to questions designed to assess
happiness and life satisfaction. They found that the older the
respondents, the more frequently they reported feeling positive
emotions like cheerfulness, good spirits, and happiness within the
past 30 days. The relationship held even when the researchers took
into account education, marital status, health, stress, personality
and other factors that might affect the results.
</P>
<P>
   The link between well-being and age was strongest for men, who
showed both an increase in positive emotions and a decrease in
negative emotions _ feeling sad, nervous, hopeless or worthless _
with advancing years, Mroczek said. Older women also reported more
positive emotions, but the researchers found no difference for
women in negative emotions across age categories. The happiest
subjects were not only older and male, but also married and high
scorers on a measure of extroversion.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, whose report will appear in the November issue
of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, analyzed data
collected as part of a large national telephone and mail survey by
the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Research Network
on Successful Midlife Development.
</P>
<P>
   What the Fordham results mean is still being debated. It could
be that the study, which surveyed a cross-section of Americans
rather than following the same individuals over decades, simply
demonstrates that adults raised before the advent of Oprah Winfrey
are less willing to reveal unhappiness or dissatisfaction. Or it
could be that a generation of people who survived the Great
Depression and World War II are happy because they are aware that
life could get much worse.
</P>
<P>
   But previous research suggests that whether someone reports
being happy is surprisingly independent of factors like income, age
and level of education. And at least some other studies have
yielded findings supporting the notion that happiness actually
increases with age.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura Carstensen, a Stanford University psychologist whose
work has also shown a relationship between age and well-being,
theorizes that older people may feel happier because they have more
practice regulating their emotions, and because they are more
likely to live in the moment. ``It's not that old people are
happy-go-lucky,'' Carstensen said, ``but that there is an
appreciation of life that is associated with a sense of well-being
and satisfaction.''

A SPACE ADVENTURE TAILORED TO GLENN'S CONTEMPORARIES

   HUTCHINSON, Kan. _ In the commander's chair of a space shuttle,
Robert Deupree safely brings his craft home after launching a
satellite into orbit. Mission completed, Deupree and his crew
emerge from the shuttle Falcon to the applause and cheers of
well-wishers.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was a fictitious mission in a simulated shuttle, and it
lasted only an hour instead of days. But the crew, average age 68,
was pleased. After a week of abbreviated astronaut training,
culminating in the intricate shuttle mission, they understood a
little better what John Glenn must be feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I was going with him,'' said Deupree, 65, a retired
government biostatistician from Branford, Conn. ``It would be the
thrill of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Deupree and his wife, Nati, 65, a travel consultant, were among
33 people from 55 to 84 from around the country who went through an
astronaut camp for older people here earlier this month sponsored
by Elderhostel, the nonprofit program in Boston that provides
educational adventures worldwide for adults ages 55 and over.
</P>
<P>
   Many participants said their interest was piqued by this week's
scheduled return to space by Sen. John Glenn, who at 77 will become
the oldest person to orbit the Earth, and by the age-related
research aboard his shuttle mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going through the catalog, spotted this program and
thought about John Glenn,'' said Helen Coyte, 76, of Phoenix. Ms.
Coyte, a veteran of 33 Elderhostel programs since 1984, is a
swimmer, speed walker and cross-country skier who has competed in
the Senior Olympics. But she said, ``When am I ever going to get
another chance to do something like this?''
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth year for the program at the Kansas
Cosmo-sphere, which houses a planetarium and space artifacts,
including the world's largest collection of spacesuits and the
restored Apollo 13 command module Odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   So far, about 160 people have completed the Elderhostel
astronaut program, including the class that finished training on
Oct. 2, said Karen Siebert, a spokesman for the center. Another 35
enrolled in the session that began Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The older space cadets attend classroom lectures about various
aspects of the space program. They use equipment designed for the
center's Future Astronaut Training Program, a summer camp for
middle-school youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment includes a centrifuge that spins two people around so
rapidly that it simulates up to five times the normal pull of
gravity, or ``5 Gs'' in astronaut terminology. There is also a
three-axis trainer, a device that looks like a giant, three-ringed
gyroscope into which people are clamped in at the feet and waist
and allowed to spin head-over-heels to test their orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Participants also fly a fighter jet simulator housed in an
actual F-101 cockpit; take a stress test that involves hitting
indicator lights in a closed, tilting compartment; operate a remote
control ``lunar rover'' robot as it crawls over a moonscape picking
up rocks, and ``fly'' shuttle missions in a realistic simulator.
</P>
<P>
   Program organizers explain the rigors of each test and let each
trainee decide whether to participate. So far, there have been no
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided not to get into the centrifuge,'' said JoAnn
Spickelmier, a Hutchinson homemaker who at 84 was the oldest cadet.
``But I did do the three-axis thing and got turned all around. I
didn't like it. It was rough. But I can say I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Spickelmier scoffed at suggestions that Glenn was too old
for space. ``Most of us would go if we had the chance,'' she said,
``He's in good shape and should make it just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman Noweck, 83, of Fair Haven, N.J., a retired systems
engineer for Bell Laboratories, said he has followed the space
program over the years, but came away from the camp with a
different perspective. ``It's a real enterprise taking thousands of
people doing their jobs right,'' he said. ``The astronauts are only
a small part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Noweck, a widower who had heart valve replacement surgery two
years ago, hesitated about the centrifuge. After calling his
cardiologist, he related: ``I decided to give it a try, since you
can stop the thing with a switch if you want to. It turned out that
5 Gs was nothing. I barely noticed a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Glenn is expected to experience only about 3 Gs on
his trip, Noweck said: ``He should do that easy. A piece of cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Deupree said his camp experience produced an added bonus,
renewing an acquaintance with the former astronaut Alan L. Bean,
who walked on the Moon in 1969 during the Apollo 12 mission. In
1958, when both men were young Naval officers, they were flying in
a two-seat training jet when it was struck by lightning over the
Rocky Mountains and Bean made a forced landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bean was amazingly cool and calm,'' Deupree says, ``He
definitely had the makings of an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing Deupree's account, officials at the Kansas
Cosmosphere contacted the Johnson Space Center in Houston, where
the former astronaut lives, and the old friends renewed their
acquaintance, meeting in Connecticut on Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him about my astronaut camp experience and how I hit
the center line of the runway when I piloted by shuttle back from
its mission,'' he said, laughing. ``I don't think he was
impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the space camp veterans, Deupree and his wife said
they planned to watch the liftoff of the shuttle Discovery carrying
Glenn and his six crew mates. ``Now that we know so much about it,
we wouldn't miss it for the world,'' Deupree said.

steps down. Littlefield, 46, who has been with NBC about 20 years
and oversaw the scheduling of hit shows such as ``Seinfeld'' and
``Cheers,'' wasn't seen as an appropriate successor to Ohlmeyer,
the report said, citing an unidentified senior NBC executive.

MAN VS. WOMAN: IN HISTORY'S TRAVEL OLYMPICS, THERE'S NO CONTEST

   What do the following boyish toys have in common?
</P>
<P>
   a) channel switcher
</P>
<P>
   b) Barcalounger
</P>
<P>
   c) golf cart
</P>
<P>
   d) Y chromosome
</P>
<P>
   Answer: They all relieve their possessor of the need or
inclination to move.
</P>
<P>
   In droll contrast to the archetype of the wandering male, the
restive Attila the Huns and Jack Kerouacs of the world, scientists
have found that, from a chromosomal perspective, men are really a
sedentary lot. They're homebodies, for whom the word ``footloose''
translates as ``favorite pair of slippers.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it seems, it is the world's women who do most of the
moving around, schlepping gamely from town to town, port to port.
No wonder we have a habit of overpacking.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting Tuesday in the journal Nature Genetics, researchers
from the Harvard School of Public Health and Stanford University
say that a comparison of strictly male versus strictly female
genetic lineages demonstrates that the rate of intercontinental
migrations of women has been about eight times that of men.
</P>
<P>
   For at least the past few thousand years, and possibly much
longer, women, not men, have been the ones to leave their natal
homes for foreign lands, and in so doing have kept the human gene
pool well blended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view of human migrations has been dominated by images of
the Marco Polos and Ghengis Khans of history,'' said Mark
Stoneking, an anthropologist and population geneticist at
Pennsylvania State University in University Park, in a telephone
interview. ``This paper tells us that we should be looking instead
at what the women are doing.'' Stoneking wrote a commentary that
appears with the new report.
</P>
<P>
   The new work is yet another example of molecular archeology, the
attempt to discern the great sweeps of human history and prehistory
by scanning the genes of the living. Perhaps the most famous result
to emerge from this highly fashionable field is the so-called
Out-of-Africa theory, the idea that modern Homo sapiens originated
in Africa about 100,000 years ago and then stampeded across the
globe, displacing archaic humans wherever they found them.
</P>
<P>
   In the current paper, Mark T. Seielstad of Harvard and Eric
Minch and Luca Cavalli-Sforza of Stanford sought to compare the
ways and means of men and women by analyzing two categories of
genetic samples taken from 75 different populations around the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   They looked at mitochondrial DNA, which is found in the cellular
powerhouses that manufacture fuel for the body. Although men have
mitochondrial DNA in their body cells just as women do, only women
can pass it along to the next generation, via their eggs; sperm
have no mitochondrial genes to offer. Hence, mitochondrial
transmission is matrilineal and tells a female-centered plot line.
</P>
<P>
   To get the counterpart male tale, the scientists looked at small
regions of the Y chromosome, which is bestowed paternally, from
father to son.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers sought to determine the degree to which
mitochondrial and Y chromosome DNA had been mixed and matched among
differing groups. They found that the Y chromosome appears to be
distributed in remarkably discrete clusters. When they looked at an
exemplary sequence of subunits on the chromosome, they saw little
average variation within men living in the same location, but wide
variation between groups of men living on different continents.
</P>
<P>
   For mitochondrial DNA, the opposite situation applied. The
researchers found considerable divergence in sequences among people
in a specific location, and consequently less of an overall
distinction between one population and the next. In short, the Y
chromosome is served straight up, mitochondrial DNA shaken and
stirred.
</P>
<P>
   The results suggest that men and their Y chromosomes stay put,
generation after generation. If new men come to town, they do not
linger long enough to add much genetic novelty to the resident mix.
For their part, women wander. They leave their place of birth and
move elsewhere, to be replaced back home by an influx of foreign
females and fresh mitochondria.
</P>
<P>
   While the new findings counter the abiding legend of the
wayfaring man and housebound woman, they dovetail with
anthropologists' understanding of the commonest marital system,
patrilocality.
</P>
<P>
   For about 70 percent of the world's cultures, women are the ones
who disperse at marriage, leaving their parents' household to move
to that of their husband. If the husband lives three villages away,
the wife migrates three villages away.
</P>
<P>
   If her daughter marries a man living another three villages'
distance, she moves thenceforth, for a total of six village lengths
from her mother's place of origin. Before you know it, a
mitochondrial matriline has crossed a continent, while the Y
chromosome has not so much as crossed the living room.
</P>
<P>
   What the scientists cannot say from their genetic analysis of
contemporary DNA is how far back in time they are looking. Have
women always migrated comparatively more than men? Is the
prevalence of patrilocality a recent or an ancient phenomenon?
Might there have been a time of widespread matrilocality, when a
woman got to stay with her family and friends, and the man was the
one fretting over a hope chest and travel plans?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our observations are static ones,'' Seilestad said. ``We don't
know when any of this began. We can speculate, though, that
patrilocality has been a common cultural practice at least since
advent of agriculture, when land became inherited patrilineally. If
males were tied to a particular piece of property, then it became
incumbent on women to do most of the moving around.''

SCIENCE WATCH:   BEARING BABY WITH EASE; NEWS FROM 55 CANCRI;
DISASTER IN SPAIN

   Carrying an infant around all day can be hard work, as any new
parent can attest. But not for a wallaby.
</P>
<P>
   Using female tammar wallabies trained to do their hopping on a
treadmill, two zoologists in Australia have discovered that the
marsupial can haul an infant in its pouch at almost no extra cost
in energy.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who reported their results in the journal
Nature, placed a load equivalent to 15 percent of each wallaby's
weight in its pouch. (A latex glove containing lead shot was used
because of the risk of injuring a baby wallaby.) The researchers
found no significant change in metabolic rate during hopping after
the load was added.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to the energy savings lies in the elastic tendons in
the animal's hind legs, which can handle the strain from each
landing, store the potential and kinetic energy involved, and apply
it to the next hop. It is the same reason wallabies (and kangaroos)
can increase their hopping speed without increasing their metabolic
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Another Disk of Debris
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers from the University of Arizona at Tucson have
observed what appears to be a disk of debris around 55 Cancri, a
star about 40 light-years from Earth that also has a planet
orbiting it.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomers, writing in Nature, say that the disk is similar
to the Kuiper belt, the ring of debris and other objects beyond
Neptune that is a relic of the early days of the solar system. The
Cancri disk may contain methane ice, which is found among objects
in the Kuiper belt.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery fulfills theoretical expectations that planetary
systems should also have some kind of debris disk. Finding the disk
also enabled the astronomers to calculate the mass of Cancri's
planet at 1.9 times that of Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   A River Like Vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia
University have calculated the extent of an environmental disaster
in April caused by the collapse of a retaining wall holding sludge
at a zinc mine in southern Spain. They say that the accident
released about 5 million cubic meters of sludge into the Guadiamar
River. The sludge was so acidic, and so plentiful, that a week
after the spill the river had the acidity of vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   The sludge also contained 120,000 tons of zinc, about the amount
that the mine produces each year, the researchers report. While the
full environmental effects are unclear, in high enough
concentrations, zinc can be toxic to many forms of life.

`SHAKESPEARE': THE VAST SHAKESPEAREAN DRAMA, WITH ALL PEOPLE AS
PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Publication notes at end of the review) 
(HLW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his 1994 magnum opus, ``The Western Canon,'' Harold Bloom
placed Shakespeare, along with Dante, at the very center of the
canon, arguing that the two ``excel all other Western writers in
cognitive acuity, linguistic energy and power of invention.'' The
rest, he argued, ``is what they absorbed and what absorbs them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloom's latest book, ``Shakespeare: The Invention of the
Human,'' is in large measure an amplification of the arguments
about him set down in that earlier volume, combined with a close
textual reading of his individual plays.
</P>
<P>
   In these pages, Bloom, Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale
University and Berg Professor of English at New York University,
goes so far as to assert that Shakespeare ``essentially invented
human personality as we continue to know and value it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Hamlet taught us  &UR; not &LR;  to have faith either in language
or in ourselves, being human was much simpler for us but also
rather less interesting,'' Bloom writes. ``Shakespeare, through
Hamlet, has made us skeptics in our relationships with anyone,
because we have learned to doubt articulateness in the realm of
affection.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds that ``our ability to laugh at ourselves as readily as
we do at others owes much to Falstaff,'' and that Shakespeare's
Cleopatra has taught us ``how complex eros is, and how impossible
it is to divorce acting the part of being in love and the reality
of being in love.''
</P>
<P>
   This eccentric notion _ that we did not know how to be human
before Shakespeare came along to tell us _ gives Bloom a title and
thesis, but it thankfully does little to contaminate his book.
Indeed, this volume is best read as an old-fashioned humanistic
commentary on Shakespeare's plays that gives us a renewed
appreciation of the playwright's staggering achievement, even as it
points up the limitations of structuralist, feminist and
neo-historicist readings of his work. It is a fiercely argued
exegesis of Shakespeare's plays in the tradition of Samuel Johnson,
Hazlitt and A.C. Bradley, a study that is as passionate as it is
erudite, as provocative as it is sometimes perverse.
</P>
<P>
   While the reader may quarrel with Bloom's dismissive treatment
of recent productions of Shakespeare's plays, while one may
disagree with his readings of individual characters and texts (his
assertion that Shylock is a ``murderous villain,'' for instance, is
both simplistic and strangely at odds with his analysis of the
moneylender's ambivalent nature), it's hard not to be impressed by
his overall knowledge of and insight into his subject's work. Bloom
deftly illuminates the ideas and motifs animating Shakespeare's
plays, succinctly shows how the playwright's life (the little that
we know of it, anyway) appears to have affected his work, and
astutely analyzes the development of his transcendent art.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier books like ``The Anxiety of Influence,'' Bloom has
articulated a Freudian theory of poetic influence, which suggests
that writers are shaped by their Oedipal struggle to free
themselves from the legacy of their literary forefathers. That
theory clearly informs this volume's assessment of Shakespeare's
growth and his relationship to his literary ancestors Chaucer and
Christopher Marlowe.
</P>
<P>
   As Bloom sees it, Shakespeare's early histories were heavily
indebted to Marlowe, an influence he parodied and exorcized with
the bloody ``Titus Andronicus'' in 1594. Once Shakespeare had
emancipated himself from the author of ``Tamburlaine,'' Bloom
continues, his characters began to evolve from two-dimensional
Marlovian cartoons like Richard III into the emotionally complex
heroes of his mature work. Hamlet, Falstaff, Rosalind, Othello,
Macbeth and Cleopatra: such characters possessed an interior life
heretofore unseen in literature, and they signified Shakespeare's
maturation as an original artist, an artist who in turn would
become a forerunner to writers and thinkers as disparate as
Kierkegaard, Emerson, Nietzsche, Freud, Ibsen, Strindberg,
Pirandello and Beckett.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare apparently wrote ``King Lear,'' ``Macbeth'' and
``Antony and Cleopatra'' in a fury of composition that spanned a
mere 14 months (1605-1606), and those plays, Bloom argues,
``conclude the major phase of Shakespeare's preoccupation with the
inner self.'' His subsequent plays, beginning with ``Coriolanus''
in 1608, would contain fewer excursions into the human heart. More
experimental in form, less intimate in mood, they would feature
characters who are more symbols or satiric ideograms than
three-dimensional human beings.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Henry VIII'' (one of his very last works, written in
1612-13, possibly with John Fletcher), Bloom writes, Shakespeare,
apparently ``weary of his own genius,'' ``undoes most of what he
had invented.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many critics have focused on the redemptive elements in
Shakespeare's plays, arguing that justice is served on the villains
in ``King Lear,'' say, or emphasizing the motifs of renewal and
resurrection in ``The Winter's Tale,'' Bloom takes a bleaker view.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this volume underscores Shakespeare's dark,
uncompromising vision, his unwavering examination of the
consequences of time and flux and loss, his acute awareness of the
contingency of love and reason.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that Shakespeare was probably unhappily married, Bloom
declares quite highhandedly that ``all Shakespearean marriages,
comic and otherwise, are zany or grotesque, since essentially the
women must marry down.'' As for filial and paternal love, he
writes, ``Shakespeare's greatest men and women are pragmatically
doom-eager not because of their relation to state power but because
their inner lives are ravaged by all the ambivalences and
ambiguities of familial love and its displacements.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hamlet's radical alienation, in Iago's malign will, in Lear's
confrontation with the abyss, in Macbeth's apprehension that life
is a tale signifying nothing, Bloom suggests, are contained the
seeds of 19th-century nihilism, Dostoevsky's brooding
existentialism and Baudelaire's spiritual malaise.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, his book may not persuade the reader that
Shakespeare was somehow responsible for ``the invention of the
human,'' but it does remind us, powerfully, of the uncanny
modernity of Shakespeare and his surpassing ability not only to
limn the human condition but also to illuminate ``our latest
intellectual fashions more sharply than they can illuminate him.''

   NEW YORK _ My Marathon Blues came earlier than usual this year.
</P>
<P>
   Normally my guilt about not running the New York City Marathon
comes a week before the event, when the excitement begins to build
and runners from all over the world converge on the city.
</P>
<P>
   But this year the blues came ahead of schedule, a month or so
ago, after workers posted the new advertisement on the billboard
overlooking the intersection of 155th and St. Nicholas Place in
Manhattan: ``New York City Marathon: Where the World Comes to
Run.'' The message was set off by a drawing of five runners
crossing the finish line, holding hands in unity and triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Great. Every November for the last 16 years, I have put the New
York City Marathon on next year's ``to do'' list. I make the same
vow to begin training, sometimes with more verve, sometimes with
less.
</P>
<P>
   Each year I purchase some new item to get myself started: a jump
rope, basketball hand grips, light weights. I bought a bike. I
could create an exhibit with the artifacts of marathons never run.
</P>
<P>
   Something always happens. First it is winter, and then there are
columns to write, dogs to walk, games to attend. Then comes the
spring thaw, then summer. The next thing I know, fall is back and
they're putting up new signs for the marathon and I've got the
blues again. That becomes a natural state in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Last year I actually came close, at least by association. Last
fall I experienced marathon preparation, vicariously, through a
friend who was running her first marathon. Ayesha Paynde, an editor
at Crown Books, had never done anything remotely resembling a
marathon. But she decided that she was going to make that journey.
Paynde bubbled all over again recently as she recalled the day of
the race, the high of heading toward the starting position and the
electricity of standing among the multitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling,'' she recalled, ``standing on the bridge and
there's this huge crowd all around you and Mayor Giuliani's there,
and he gives a little speech, the helicopters are hovering
overhead, you look around you and there are people of every
imaginable race and nationality all around you and everybody's just
so psyched and screaming and cheering and the adrenaline is
flowing.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Paynde, there will be no sequel this year; she'll be
among the spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running a marathon was one of the most thrilling experiences
of my entire life,'' she said, ``and so in a way I was a little bit
scared that if I did it again it wouldn't feel as good. And so I
made a conscious choice not to do it. But I haven't found anything
remotely equally exciting to replace it. So I'm missing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again I've missed it, too, though what I really crave is
almost everything except the running: the electric charge on the
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge; the high of running through different
neighborhoods; the thrill of hugging family and friends at the
finish line; heroically wrapping the silver blanket around my body,
and wearing it for the next week.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is all the blanks that I would have to
fill in to make that happen. Truth be told, I hated running.
Sprinting was what I loved. Throughout my athletic experiences _
grammar school, high school, college _ running was something I did
to get in shape for racing.
</P>
<P>
   Paynde said that what turned her on was exactly that process of
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible ego boost,'' she said. ``The knowledge that
at some point in the training you realize, `Oh, my God; I can do
this.' Especially somebody like me who's never really pushed
herself that hard physically. To know that I could do something so
extraordinary, like running 26 miles. It gave me the kind of lift
nothing else has ever given me, including getting good grades in
school, because that always came easily to me. This was a huge
physical accomplishment for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six miles. The number flashes in my head like the neon
light on that billboard at 155th and St. Nick's.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, I've got into the habit of getting in my
car and resetting the trip odometer to zero. As I drive, I check to
see how far I've traveled, and then try to imagine what it would be
like to run that distance. From my house to La Guardia is eight
miles _ imagine running from my house to the airport. Doable.
</P>
<P>
   From my house to Giants Stadium _ 11 miles _ imagine running to
the Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine running from my house to Hempstead, on Long Island. My
imagine screen goes blank.
</P>
<P>
   My Times colleague Ozier Muhammad, who has run five marathons,
including New York in 1990 and 1992, cautioned me that running a
marathon is as much mental as it is physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not just body preparedness but mental preparedness,'' Muhammad
said. ``Getting your mind prepared to run four hours is a big
undertaking.''
</P>
<P>
   So once again I'll begin my mental undertaking on Sunday,
spurred by the familiar tinge of guilt when all the runners pass
through the boroughs greeted by hundreds of thousands of fans and
well-wishers. But I've made a pact to start marathon training in
earnest next month.
</P>
<P>
   This time, for sure.

   NEW YORK _ Alice Tully Hall is the answer. The question is:
Where will the pianist Byron Janis celebrate the 50th anniversary
of his Carnegie Hall debut?
</P>
<P>
   Thursday is the night, and 7:30 is the time. But the real story
here is one of perseverance. Janis, who turned 70 in March, has
come back from psoriatic arthritis, which struck him in 1973 and
eventually forced him to halt his concert career. His program will
include works by Mozart, Schumann, Prokofiev, Albeniz, Wagner and
Liszt, and the version of Chopin's ``Valse Brillante'' in E flat
major that Janis discovered in 1973 at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   Flipped Lid
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The music was classical but the piano was
contemporary when Martha Argerich appeared as soloist with the
Montreal Symphony, led by Charles Dutoit, at Carnegie Hall on
Sunday afternoon. The music, just before intermission, was the
Liszt Piano Concerto No. 1 in E flat. The piano, wheeled onstage
for this piece, was a Steinway with a difference _ two lids.
</P>
<P>
   The second lid, hanging underneath, was intended to throw sound
forward, enriching the music. The device, invented by Daniel
Revenaugh, was being used for the first time by a Carnegie Hall
artist. When Ms. Argerich finished playing, the audience called for
more. On this day, there was no encore.
</P>
<P>
   Souvenirs
</P>
<P>
   Love's magic (and evanescent) spell is on the auction block this
week in Paris. The lovers were Pablo Picasso and Dora Maar, a
mistress and muse, who was dropped in 1944 after nine years for a
younger woman, Francoise Gilot. Ms. Maar, a Surrealist
photographer, died last year at 89, leaving one of the last great

   It includes 10 paintings, seven of them portraits of Ms. Maar,
including the four ``Weeping Woman'' oils for which she modeled and
50 drawings, including the colorful, erotic ``Dora Maar and the
Minotaur.'' ``The Picassos of Dora Maar'' auction begins Tuesday
and continues through Thursday at the Maison de la Chimie in Paris.

   Master of Beauty
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The figures, precisely rendered, have a porcelainlike
quality. Draped in shimmering silks, seen in otherworldly nocturnal
lighting, they seem in balletic motion, their gestures emphasized
dramatically. Welcome to the world of Donato Creti, who descended
into obscurity soon after his death in 1749, perhaps because his
conception of idealized beauty set him apart from other artists.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday through Jan. 31, the Metropolitan Museum of Art will pay
homage to this major figure of 18th-century Italian painting with
an exhibition called ``Donato Creti: Melancholy and Perfection,''
comprising his masterpiece, a cycle of 17 mythological and
allegorical paintings created between 1713 and 1721 and seen for
the first time outside his native Bologna.

IS THIS BILL NECESSARY?

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One piece of unfinished business left behind when
Congress adjourned is a measure adding new categories to the
extra-stiff sentences imposed on criminals whose vicious deeds are
motivated by specialized hatred toward others because of who they
are.
</P>
<P>
   We already have a hate-crime law that imposes an extra penalty
on convicted felons for attacks that single out victims for their
race, color, religion or national origin. The law is a useful
symbolic tool in the constant public struggle against racial
bigotry and violence.
</P>
<P>
   But its practical effect is the subject of much heated debate,
since most offenders would be punished severely anyway for their
acts. And proving motive is often difficult, dependent on comments
allegedly made at the scene or even years previously.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed new law would extend coverage to include gender,
physical or mental disability or sexual orientation. This sounds
like a sensible, morally imperative thing to do. Racial minorities
are not the only category of Americans discriminated against and
sometimes abused by angry individuals or gangs who cannot tolerate
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   A macho creep who beats up and rapes women simply because he
doesn't respect the opposite sex, for instance, is just as much a
menace to society as one who picks on blacks because of their
color.
</P>
<P>
   The recent brutal murder of Wyoming University student Matthew
Shepard, apparently at least in part because he was gay, has
galvanized human rights advocates and increased public pressure for
passage of the hate crimes extension. It has reminded us all of the
continuing struggle of the gay community to be accepted and win
treatment equal to that of heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress rushed to adjourn, President Clinton urged passage
of the measure to make it clear that crimes of hate ``cannot be
tolerated.'' Despite that appeal, the lawmakers opted to go home to
campaign and worry about intolerance later.
</P>
<P>
   And a little more time spent thinking this through might not be
a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Shepard's killers should get the death penalty,
which is legal under Wyoming law, as it is in most states. But they
should pay the ultimate penalty for premeditated, unprovoked murder
regardless of the victim's sexual orientation. They should pay it
even if Shepard had been a heterosexual with 10 children.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects were quickly apprehended and charged with beating
up Shepard during a robbery and leaving him to die, lashed to a
fence in freezing temperatures. Based on the prompt police action
thus far, adding a hate-crime charge to the basic murder rap would
seem redundant. The state cannot execute the killers twice.
</P>
<P>
   In Laurel, Md., recently, a Salvadoran dishwasher was brutally
beaten during a robbery and left to die on a street corner in a
case similar to that of Shepard. Yet Shepard's killing is
classified as a hate crime; the killing of Gilberto Hernandez is
not.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that Shepard's killers are quoted as having
made anti-gay remarks. The thugs accused of killing Hernandez are
not known to have expressed any anti-Hispanic or anti-immigrant
bias. Yet Hernandez was just as wronged as Shepard and is just as
dead.
</P>
<P>
   And this is the conundrum at the heart of federal hate crimes
legislation. Of course we must recognize that hatred can be a
motive for violence when no other cause seems to justify it, and we
must punish it appropriately when proved. Yet we send criminals to
jail for their specific deeds, not their inner ugliness.
</P>
<P>
   Just how to do this carefully and judiciously while protecting
freedom of speech and belief (no matter how offensive) is trickier
than the bill's advocates will admit.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there is the problem of making a legitimate legal
distinction between crimes committed out of loathing for some group
and those committed out of greed, jealousy or any other of the
human weaknesses that drive individuals to disastrous behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Criminals often act out of many motives. Proof that hatred
drives a crime often depends on witnesses with their own biases and
memories that can be faulty. This is not terribly scientific stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Was the victim targeted because of ethnic prejudice or because
of a perception of physical vulnerability? Does a man commit rape
because of lust for an individual, generic hatred for her gender,
or both? Should the penalty be harsher for pushing an old woman in
a wheelchair off a cliff while loudly making fun of the elderly or
for bashing in some innocent kid simply to steal his really cool
pair of shoes?
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has the
correct approach. He said he was sympathetic to both sides and will
hold hearings next year to air conflicts among the judicial rights
involved. He cited concerns for the First Amendment and the
potential for double jeopardy as well as the need for a federal
demonstration of concern over crimes driven by hatred and bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   It would be wise to make this decision after reasoned debate
instead of rushing it through Congress in reaction to the emotional
outrage generated by the Shepard case.

AUDRA MCDONALD: CAREER TAKES OFF, BUT THE EGO IS ON A LEASH

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are moments in a theatrical career when
everything clicks, when an actor is embraced by both the public and
the critics, when the awards and accolades just seem to keep
coming.
</P>
<P>
   This is that kind of moment for Audra McDonald, the 28-year-old
actress with a mezzo-soprano the likes of which, many say, comes
along once in a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   In only the last two months, Ms. McDonald has been lavishly
praised for her performance of selections from ``Porgy and Bess''
in Gershwin centenary concerts with Michael Tilson Thomas and the
San Francisco Symphony; for her rendition of show tunes in ``My
Favorite Broadway: The Leading Ladies'' at Carnegie Hall, and for
her first album, ``Way Back to Paradise,'' (Nonesuch Records),
which features the work of young composers.
</P>
<P>
   One of those composers, Michael John LaChiusa, is writing a
musical play for Ms. McDonald _ ``Marie Christine'' _ that Lincoln
Center Theater plans to produce next season.
</P>
<P>
   And last week she was hailed for the first of three Monday
evening performances at Joe's Pub, the new cabaret at the Joseph
Papp Public Theater. In his review in The New York Times, Stephen
Holden wrote that because of her alternately soaring and bluesy
voice, ``a better musical future seems not only possible but upon
us, right here, right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the fact that Ms. McDonald has won three Tony
awards in the last four years, and she isn't even 30 yet.
</P>
<P>
   But sitting in her dressing room before a performance of
``Ragtime'' last week _ for which she won her third Tony _ Ms.
McDonald was loath to view this point in her life as a peak or in
any way defining. ``It certainly feels like a lot is happening at
once _ I must admit it's a bit overwhelming,'' she said. ``But I'm
trying not to think of it as a moment, because I want to continue
to do this and continue to grow, because I think I have so far to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDonald's path has been charmed since the beginning. In
1994 she won a Tony for her portrayal of Carrie Pipperidge in
Lincoln Center Theater's production of ``Carousel.'' She won
another Tony in 1996 for her portrayal of a voice student in
``Master Class,'' the Terrence McNally play about Maria Callas. And
she won her third Tony last spring, for her portrayal of Sarah,
Coalhouse Walker Jr.'s love interest in ``Ragtime,'' a role she
plays through Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDonald does not seem to be completely aware of the extent
to which her work has been celebrated of late: She recently
resolved to stop reading her own reviews. ``I have had to do things
to keep me centered and grounded,'' she said, ``like not reading
reviews, and going to my voice lessons obsessively, and walking the
dog.''
</P>
<P>
   The importance of such reality checks was ingrained in Ms.
McDonald by her father, a high school principal in Fresno, Calif.,
where Ms. McDonald grew up, and her mother, director of the
affirmative-action program at California Polytechnic State
University at San Luis Obispo.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDonald, who was performing in community theater by age 9,
said her parents refused to let her move to New York to look for
work 10 years ago unless she pursued an education; she enrolled in
Juilliard for classical vocal training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have very practical parents,'' Ms. McDonald said. ``You
can't just go on a dollar and a dream _ that was the mantra that
was beaten into our heads _ because there are a million people
behind you willing to take your place and a million people ahead of
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have worked with her say Ms. McDonald has so far
managed to avoid the pitfalls of fame, that she still retains the
look-how-lucky-I-am reverence of someone who has just landed her
first role. ``She's a very giving artist with almost no ego,'' said
Brian Stokes Mitchell, who plays opposite Ms. McDonald in
``Ragtime.'' ``If anything, she's been very resistant to outside
forces telling her how great she is.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. McDonald said she remembered all too well what it
felt like to be in line at the unemployment office after she
arrived in New York; she recently reread her frustrated journal
entries from that time. ``I was thinking, `God, I want to be a
Broadway star _ what am I doing at Juilliard?''' Ms. McDonald
recalled. ``That's still very, very close to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It all changed for Ms. McDonald at a Lincoln Center Theater
casting call for ``Carousel.'' Ira Weitzman, the associate producer
of musical theater at Lincoln Center who led the audition, clearly
remembers the day; June 24, 1993. Ms. McDonald sang ``Bill'' from
``Showboat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never forget it,'' Weitzman said. ``We all started to
lean forward. You could just feel the hairs on the back of your
head start to move.''
</P>
<P>
   At her big call-back, in front of the director, producers and
people from the Richard Rodgers estate, Ms. McDonald opened her
mouth to sing and fainted. (She quickly recovered and, of course,
got the role.) ``She has the most extraordinary, natural,
instinctive, magnetic intelligence,'' said Nicholas Hytner, who
directed Ms. McDonald in ``Carousel.'' ``It's really one of those
gifts that you have no idea how to describe or analyze.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mandy Patinkin, who sang with Ms. McDonald on the album
``Leonard Bernstein's New York,'' said: ``Her voice completely
intimidates me. She makes me feel like Rex Harrison should have
felt when he was singing with Julie Andrews. I feel like I'd be
much better off just talking. She's got a voice from God, just
straight from God.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ms. McDonald _ who lives on Manhattan's Upper West Side with
her boyfriend of six years, a bassist who plays on Broadway _ does
not convey the confidence of having arrived. She said she wanted to
become a better actress; she has no formal acting training. She
said she does not expect her voice to fully mature for seven to 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   And she said she continued to navigate the traditionally
distinct worlds of classical music and Broadway. Because of her
operatic background, for example, Ms. McDonald said belting still
feels like sacrilege. (But she does it anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   And though it would seem that her many recent successes would
add up to a smooth ride from here on out, Ms. McDonald said she
still had to audition for parts and imagined she always would. ``I
don't know that it ever does end for anybody,'' she said. ``You
still have to go in and prove yourself, over and over each time.''

`FRONTLINE': PLANTING OMINOUS SEEDS IN MINDS OF CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Frontline'' returns on Tuesday night to the 1980s, when the
nation was afflicted by an epidemic of accusations of child abuse.
Here again are the bizarre charges, sensational headlines, anxious
parents, zealous or gullible prosecutors and juries persuaded by
the testimony of children led on by so-called therapists. The one
new element reported on Tuesday night is the role of Janet Reno,
who, when a state attorney in Miami, won a reputation for producing
a method of getting convictions in shaky cases.
</P>
<P>
   One of her targets was Grant Snowden, a police officer who had
been acquitted of sex abuse charges by a Miami jury that did not
believe the solitary witness against him, a child. Ms. Reno's
office devised a new prosecutorial strategy, dependent on
therapists who are described here as ``the Pied Pipers of child
abuse in Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Through manipulative questioning, examples of which can be seen
on Tuesday night, they provided prosecutors with child witnesses
against alleged molesters like Snowden, who was then convicted of
the new charges and sentenced to five life terms.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, in which Ms. Reno took particular interest, a
young defendant was acquitted after a two-year prosecution that
cost $3 million. The defense finally won its case with the help of
a respected child psychologist from Cornell University who exposed
how readily a young child could be led to say almost anything that
would suit an adroit interviewer, however improbable the charges.
His analysis proved damning.
</P>
<P>
   That case, says Peter Boyer, the ``Frontline'' reporter, broke
``the sex abuse fever'' in Miami, and last April, after 12 years in
jail, Snowden won his appeal. The issue, his lawyer says, was not
whether the children were lying but whether the memories of abuse
had been implanted in them by the therapists.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors went on to file their own appeal, but by then,
we are pointedly reminded, Ms. Reno had long since left Miami to
become Attorney General and had approved a fatal raid on the Branch
Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, because she was convinced that
the children there were being abused.

LONG HAIR, A LA CHER  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think Cher. The hair story for next spring, as played out on the
European runways, is long and straight, falling well below the
shoulders, and most often parted in the center.
</P>
<P>
   The quintessential style was seen at Gucci, which recalled the
Sonny and Cher era. There were slight variations at the other
shows, like Versace's, where long straight hair was parted on the
side the way Donatella Versace herself wears it.
</P>
<P>
   Miuccia Prada's models sometimes had a bobby pin or clip holding
side-parted hair away from the face.
</P>
<P>
   At Chloe, hair was sexily tousled. At Valentino, the attitude
was more sophisticated, with long hair brushed back from the face
to spill down the back. A few models had long bangs. Chanel's
version was stylized, with a hank of hair hanging down one side of
the face and the rest pulled neatly back into a bun.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with short hair who wants to achieve the Cher look should
start growing it now.

FASHION WORLD FEARFUL OF FALLOUT FROM WORLD ECONOMIC WOES

<P>
   As the millennium rapidly approaches, fashion is in a fix, and
not about mundane matters like hemlines and silhouettes. There are
intimations of a worldwide recession looming, and fears that the
Y2K computer glitch will disrupt communication and transportation _
not to mention making it impossible to withdraw cab fare from a
bank machine in the early hours of New Year's Day 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this uncertainty, will women want to spend money on
expensive clothes?
</P>
<P>
   That is a question retailers are grappling with, as they place
their orders for the high-fashion spring styles for 1999 that they
just saw in Europe. It isn't just a matter of whether women will
buy pastels or neutrals, go for romance or utility. It's more about
anticipating women's moods in the months to come. Will they want to
teeter on the edge of the volcano in the glitz and glamour of Tom
Ford's collection for Gucci? Or will they relate to the downbeat
mood of Alber Elbaz's last show for Guy Laroche, with the elegiac
``Annabel Lee'' read on the soundtrack? Or go the sweater-and-pants
route of the Michael Kors collection for Celine?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think there'll be an overabundance of frivolity at
the buying level,'' said Kal Ruttenstein, the senior vice president
for fashion direction of Bloomingdale's. ``We think the customer
will have specific items she's looking for, but fashion stimulates
her. A tough economy doesn't scare us, but this season will
separate the men from the boys. It requires sharp editing on our
part.''
</P>
<P>
   Fall sales in many stores have been lackluster because of the
shaky state of the economy, so retailers are bound to be concerned
about spring. As one executive of a high-end store said _ although
not for attribution _ ``If the stock market goes south, our
customers lose millions.''
</P>
<P>
   But being in the fashion business is rather like remarrying
after a divorce: a triumph of optimism over experience. So, while
not closing their eyes to reality, retailers are looking on the
bright side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oddly enough, the spring season looks good to us in a certain
way,'' said Judy Collinson, the executive vice president and
general merchandise manager of women's wear for Barneys New York.
``Lots of what we saw was really wearable. There were irresistible
colors like pale yellow, blue, pink and red. There were many more
dresses, which women say they can never find enough of. Women may
think before they buy, but they'll buy what makes them feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   H.W. Mullins, the executive vice president of Neiman Marcus,
said that while he expected customers to be a little more cautious
next spring, he still expected an increase in sales, but less so in
the mid-priced collections known as bridge lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're buying more than last year,'' he said. ``Our growth over
the last four years has been very strong. We're more enthusiastic
about designer apparel than bridge, which has been difficult for a
couple of years. Most of our growth comes from the designer and
couture areas, where we can differentiate ourselves from the
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the trends for spring are varied, with few
easy-to-acquire overall looks, everyone expects that women will buy
items rather than complete outfits. And that will affect the size
of an individual sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see that trend as somewhat of a challenge,'' Mullins said.
``When women buy a suit, it's a big-ticket sale. When they don't,
you have to sell a lot more things.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some seasons when an overriding trend could be
encapsulated in a single word or phrase like ``romantic'' or
``tailored'' or ``retro,'' this spring brought no unanimity among
designers. They went in several directions, including romantic,
rock-star glamorous and sportive, offering choices that will no
doubt please some while leaving others confused. There is no one
look that a woman will feel she has to have to be at the height of
fashion, and there is no one designer whose collection sums up the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The sportswear attitude that was so strong for fall was still in
evidence, even in spite of the wealth of dresses on the runways.
Suits were almost nonexistent, replaced by unmatched pieces. Tops
were unstructured jackets or cardigans or simply a shirt, a tank or
a halter.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, after years of being eclipsed by T-shirts and
turtlenecks, the blouse has resurfaced. John Galliano showed
full-sleeved silk blouses in white or prints with a retro air. Both
Dries van Noten and Veronique Branquinho showed high-necked
Victorian and Edwardian shirtwaists. And then there were the
peasant and gypsy blouses, seen everywhere from Clements Ribeiro in
London to Valentino in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Dresses and skirts had fluidity, cut into A-lines or with
pleats, multiple slits or gathers, and were generally knee length
or longer. Pants ran the gamut from lean to as full as skirts, and
came in many lengths. There were capris, pants that were cropped
above the ankles and some that trailed on the ground. Hip-huggers
were preferred, and there was an attempt to revive hot pants.
</P>
<P>
   All kinds of prints were shown, soft pastels as well as bold
flower-power renditions and geometrics inspired by modern art.
Pretty florals were seen at Emanuel Ungaro, Christian Lacroix and
Chloe, while the biggest and brightest florals were at Gucci, where
Tom Ford paired them with snugly zipped leather jackets that bared
the midriff. Geometrics turned up at Clements Ribeiro, Alberta
Ferretti and Herve Leger.
</P>
<P>
   Fabrics that weren't printed had surface interest in the form of
tucking, pleating, crinkling, top stitching or glazing. And of
course beading, which tended to be added with a light hand or
veiled with a layer of tulle. Some of Cerruti's fabrics were
decorated with strips of plastic, and Prada's had mirrors imbedded
in them. The mirrors were tiny rounds or larger squares and may
present a cleaning problem, not to mention years of bad luck should
they break.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic-inspired styles came from some of the most influential
designers, including Miuccia Prada, Jil Sander and Marc Jacobs for
Louis Vuitton. Burberry took the hard edge off motorcycle jackets
and biker pants by showing them in butterscotch-colored leather.
</P>
<P>
   There were refined versions of baseball jackets and warm-up
jackets, but the sweatshirt was the most popular choice, replacing
the tailored day jacket at Giorgio Armani and morphing into evening
wear in organza and taffeta at several houses. There were knitted
ponchos at Valentino and organza ponchos at Vuitton.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking sights at the shows in London, Paris
and Milan was the contrast between the viewers clad in black and
the models in white, off-white, beige and icy pastels. There were
some bright pinks, blues and reds on the runways, but precious
little black or gray.
</P>
<P>
   The early round of shows in New York, before those in Europe got
under way, was also awash in color. Retailers said that they were
pleased at the trend and that they hoped it would continue in next
week's final round of shows in New York.
</P>

GETTING HELP GETTING THERE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 1) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOSEPH SIANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most important things travelers buy with their
vacation dollars is time _ the precious weeks, days or even hours
in which they get to explore undiscovered horizons. That is why it
is so annoying to become lost while on a driving trip: it's a
particularly expensive waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States military, that swordmaker with the
plowshare outlet store, has developed technology that can help keep
a car trip on the right path. Since the 1970s, the military has
used signals from its network of 24 Global Positioning Satellites
to pinpoint targets on earth within inches.
</P>
<P>
   This GPS system has been adapted by the civilian market into
computers that can guide motorists to their destinations turn by
turn.
</P>
<P>
   Navigation computers _ featuring full-color maps on dashboard
monitors and directions spoken by reassuring-sounding voices _ are
a hot option in luxury cars, turning up in such brands as Lexus and
Mercedes at a price of $2,000 to $2,500. But less affluent
travelers can find their way around, too.
</P>
<P>
   Some car-rental companies offer cars equipped with these
computers in selected cities. And there are navigation systems that
can be run by laptop computers, for use in the family car or a
rental car.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike CD-ROMs that print out directions on a home computer,
these programs work in real time, showing you where you are within
100 yards on a road map and correcting you when you make a wrong
turn.
</P>
<P>
   After road-testing eight of these systems, I have found my way
back to tell you that although the better ones sharply reduce the
risk of getting lost (particularly in larger cities), they do not
completely eliminate it. There are two different sets of map
databases in use; the most carefully researched ones _ which
literally offer house-by-house coverage _ encompass about 3,000
cities, accounting for more than half the United States population.
</P>
<P>
   But out in Montana, for example, you are on your own unless your
destination appears on a major roadway. And the lists of
restaurants, banks, shopping centers and other points of interest
that these computers include are not complete or fully up to date.
</P>
<P>
   Renting a Car With a System The least expensive way to try a
navigation computer is to rent a car equipped with one.
</P>
<P>
   Hertz has 8,000 cars with on-board navigation computers in 35
cities, said Lauren E. Garvey, a spokeswoman. The cities include
Atlanta, Chicago, New York, Washington and Los Angeles, in vehicles
ranging from midsize to luxury cars. The cost is $6 a day extra.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 800 cars in the Avis fleet equipped with
navigation computers, all spread among five Florida airports: in
Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, Tampa, Miami and Orlando. The
computers are available on Buick Skylarks, Pontiac Bonnevilles or
similar-size cars at $6 a day extra.
</P>
<P>
   National has had about 500 cars equipped with navigation
computers for the last two years in Atlanta and Detroit. ``And we
really haven't had much response on them,'' said Dan Callahan of
National.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Alamo, Budget and Dollar Thrifty said that their
companies did not offer cars with navigation systems.
</P>
<P>
   Because these systems are designed for one purpose only _
guiding a motorist _ they are very user-friendly (not nearly as
difficult to learn as a new program for a home computer). The
address or name of a business is entered into the dash-mounted
screen from a menu of possibilities by means of a button with four
directional arrows, and within seconds the first of a complete set
of turn-by-turn directions appears on the screen _ and is spoken by
a clear, human-sounding voice.
</P>
<P>
   The computer's database includes many major landmarks, hotels,
shopping centers, restaurants and even ATMs. The navigation
computer is most effective if you know the street address of your
destination _ so that, if you are looking for a hot new restaurant
in Los Angeles, for example, the computer will get you there even
if the place is not in its list of restaurants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If a street address is in a city of 50,000 or more, the
navigation computer should be able to come up with directions. And
if any confusion along the way leads to a wrong turn, the computer
will alert you by voice and by arrows on the screen within less
than a minute and redraw the route.
</P>
<P>
   Software Kits for Laptops
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with a laptop can, for a few hundred dollars extra, have
a portable navigation computer as well. Two companies sell kits
with the software and the car GPS antenna, about the size of a
computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Travroute, a company in Princeton, N.J., sells Door-to-Door
Copilot for $199. It will run on any laptop with a 75-megahertz
logic chip, 16 megabytes of RAM and 120 megabytes of hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   The kit contains two CDs (one with the route-finding program,
the other with street maps for the contiguous 48 states) and the
GPS antenna. Or you can buy the system already installed in a
Toshiba Libretto, a laptop slightly larger than a daily
appointment-planner.
</P>
<P>
   Priced at $1,499 or $1,999 depending on the speed, it has
voice-recognition technology that lets the driver speak direction
requests to the computer, while keeping hands on the wheel. If you
make a wrong turn, it lets you know by saying something along the
lines of ``Calculating new route.'' Contact Travroute Software,
1000 Herrontown Road, Princeton, N.J. 08540; (888) 872-8768 or
www.travroute.com.
</P>
<P>
   The other kit, Street PC 98, is sold by Liikkuva Systems
International. The software, including nine disks covering the
contiguous 48 states and the GPS antenna, costs $399. Liikkuva
(``mobile'' in Finnish) is at 3330 Cameron Park Drive, Suite 400,
Cameron Park, Calif. 95682; (800) 513-9989, www.liikkuva.com.
Liikkuva recommends a laptop with a 133-megahertz chip or faster,
with 32 MB RAM and a 400-MB hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Because both of these programs work with Windows 95 or 98, they
take longer to start than the on-board navigation computers
designed specifically for cars, which are ready to go a few seconds
after being turned on. Both speak in a computer-synthesized voice
that is sometimes hard to understand.
</P>
<P>
   Also, these two programs require users to do some navigating
themselves _ through a series of commands, text input and icons
that built-in car computers don't require. Simply put, you can
learn how to use a purpose-built in-car navigation system in one
trip, while Door-to-Door or Street PC 98 will take a weekend or
more to get used to.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, you don't have to buy a Mercedes-Benz or rely
on a rental-car company to honor your request for a
computer-equipped car.
</P>
<P>
   Street PC 98, because it uses a more detailed series of street
database disks, is more likely to come up with the right set of
directions than Door-to-Door Copilot. The makers of Copilot have
put all 48 states onto one CD-ROM and have primarily relied on
Census Bureau maps.
</P>
<P>
   Street PC 98, on the other hand, uses map-database disks created
by Navigation Technologies of Rosemont, Ill., whose field
representatives gather details on all the streets, businesses and
landmarks on its disks. Using Navigation Technology disks is
comparable to having someone sitting next to you who has been down
the same road before.
</P>
<P>
   Using Door-to-Door, by comparison, is like having a person next
to you who is reading a street map. Door-to-Door too often acted as
if it were new in town, instructing me to do the illegal (like
going down a one-way street the wrong way), the impossible (like
turning left onto a divided highway) or the incomprehensible (like
taking an Interstate southbound when the only choices were east- or
westbound).
</P>
<P>
   There are other such programs and devices on the market. Datus,
part of the South Korean conglomerate Daewoo, sells a device about
as big as a large remote control that I did not try. It contains an
antenna and screen, and costs $995, plus $349 to $849 for the map
data. Contact Datus, 70 Las Colinas Lane, San Jose, Calif. 95119;
(408) 360-4200.
</P>
<P>
   But the portable navigation computer that was the most fun, as
well as the simplest, was something called the Avstar Navigator,
which costs about $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   This one has no keys to press or screen to look at, so it is
probably the safest navigation system to use while driving. About
the size of a large loaf of bread, it works by voice recognition _
talk to it, and it talks back. It comes with a central processing
unit into which the map disks are inserted, a speaker-microphone
that you can clip onto a sun visor and a GPS antenna (with the more
expensive AVN-2 model, which is the only one I'd recommend).
</P>
<P>
   You also get all four map disks, but only one disk is
pre-activated; you must pay $89 to activate a second disk, $79 for
a third, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Until you become truly conversant with it, the Avstar Navigator
can be run off a basic set of voice commands. The voice-recognition
technology seemed pretty reliable. (Just try to keep the windows
closed and be sure to turn down the radio when you speak to it.)
</P>
<P>
   And you will usually not have to spell out the entire name of
the street you are seeking _ if it is a distinctive name, like
Broadway, you could spell as little as B-R-O-A, and the Avstar
Navigator will figure out what you want. If you say ``I am lost,''
it will replan the route from wherever you are.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a little longer to make a trip request with the Avstar
Navigator than it does with a typical in-car navigation computer
(at least with the beginner commands), but it is faster than the
Street PC 98 or Copilot systems.
</P>
<P>
   And Avstar is a truly hands-off navigation system. It's all done
by conversation between you and the unit, which speaks in a clear
male voice (it even hums when calculating a longer route to let you
know it isn't ignoring you).
</P>
<P>
   The main drawbacks are twofold: it is bulkier than a laptop, and
the four map disks cover only slightly more than half the
metropolitan areas included in the full set of Navigation
Technologies disks, which are used by most carmakers.
</P>
<P>
   I also found the Avstar system a bit balky to start; otherwise
it ran fine. Avstar is manufactured by IVS Inc., 121 East
Huntington Drive, Monrovia, Calif. 91016; (626) 256-3100; www.
avstar.ivs.com.

IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT STRETCHING FORMULA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Hawaii, N.C., Minn.)  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By LIZ NEPORENT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For decades, experts have been reminding everyone to stretch, in
order to improve and maintain flexibility. For the first time, the
American College of Sports Medicine has issued guidelines for
flexibility training.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations, recently published in the journal Medicine
&AMP; Science in Sports &AMP; Exercise, seem relatively straightforward:
Stretch at least twice a week, preferably after warming up, when
the body temperature is elevated and muscles are more pliable;
incorporate stretching exercises into an overall fitness plan;
perform three or four stretches for each often-used muscle group,
like the thighs, lower back and chest; and hold each stretching
position for 10 to 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   However, some stretching and flexibility experts take issue with
this advice. Tom Beaumont, a senior exercise physiologist at the
Sports Center at Chelsea Piers in New York, says the guidelines are
too broad. ``They are safe for the general population,'' he said,
``but may not be as effective for someone trying to attain a
specific athletic goal, like maintaining good flexibility while
training for marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaumont said that other stretching techniques, like one known
as PNF (or proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation) might lead to
a greater degree of flexibility. Many personal trainers and
physical therapists use that technique with their clients. This
method involves tightening a muscle for six seconds followed by a
10- to 30-second stretch assisted by another person or with the aid
of a rope or towel.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wharton, an exercise physiologist and co-author of ``The
Whartons' Stretch Book'' (Random House, 1996), also finds the
guidelines lacking. ``I'm disappointed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Following the conventional techniques outlined by the sports
college, an organization devoted to medicine and exercise science,
may lead to muscle damage, Wharton said, if the muscles are pulled
too hard, too far and for too long, causing them to tighten up and
spring back upon themselves. This automatic defense mechanism,
which prevents ripping and tearing, is known as the myotatic, or
stretch, reflex.
</P>
<P>
   A better way to stretch, Wharton suggests, is with active
isolated stretching, which has become popular in health clubs,
especially group classes.
</P>
<P>
   This method calls for tightening the muscle opposite the muscle
targeted for a stretch, then moving that muscle into a stretched
position and holding it just long enough to elongate the muscle
without triggering the myotatic reflex. For example, to stretch the
hamstrings, tighten the quadriceps muscle first and then move into
a hamstring stretch for only about two seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muscles have equal and opposite reactions,'' Wharton
explained. ``When you contract, or shorten one, the opposite one
has no recourse but to relax and lengthen.'' Wharton is organizing
a large study at the University of Florida in Gainesville that will
compare several stretching techniques, including active isolated
stretching and PNF.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters more confusing, some research makes a case for
skipping flexibility work altogether. Studies conducted at the
University of Hawaii and Guilford College in Greensboro, N.C.,
found that runners who did not stretch expended less energy and had
fewer injuries than those who did.
</P>
<P>
   Another investigation, reported in Research Quarterly for
Exercise and Sport, discovered that some exercisers actually
experienced increased muscle soreness after stretching.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Dr. Katherine Schmitz, a research fellow at the
University of Minnesota, said the American College of Sports
Medicine took a positive step by issuing the guidelines. ``Though
we have yet to prove it beyond a doubt, intuitively we know it's
good to stretch,'' she said. ``These recommendations give people a
safe, clear direction on how to do it.''

FOR VACATIONERS, LA NINA PREVIEWS ARE MIXED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 1) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Vt., Calif.)   (af)  
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last May, climatologists noted an abrupt cooling of the water in
the tropical Pacific Ocean, clearly signaling the end of last
year's infamous El Nino and the beginning of this year's La Nina,
the latest swing of the planet's climatic pendulum.
</P>
<P>
   They predicted correctly that the hurricane season that
officially ends Nov. 30 would be much worse than last year's.
Hurricane Bonnie, which sent tens of thousands packing when it
swept across the Carolina shores in late August, proved them right,
as did Georges, which ravaged parts of the Caribbean and the Gulf
Coast of the United States a few weeks later. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But while many vacations were ruined by the onset of La Nina, it
looks as though many others will be blessed, if the long-term
forecasts of climatologists prove reliable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New England and the northern Rockies may see more snow this
winter: good news for skiers. The Gulf Coast and Florida are likely
to be warmer and drier than usual: just what snowbirds are
seeking. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And some enthusiasts are expecting ``epic'' surf in Hawaii.
California, however, is less likely this year to see the large,
storm-driven waves that caused spectacular erosion on beaches and
cliffs last year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although even the increasingly reliable long-term forecasts
cannot say exactly where and when a big blizzard, drought, deluge
or heat wave will happen, anybody whose vacation plans are at the
mercy of the weather may well wonder what La Nina has in store for
the next several months. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific oscillate over the
years, with El Nino characterized by unusually warm temperatures
and La Nina by unusually cool temperatures. The intensity of the
swings varies. But whichever way the pendulum swings, the effects
are felt worldwide. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, temperatures during El Nino years are
warmer than usual in the north central states and cooler than usual
in the southeast and southwest; during a La Nina year, winter
temperatures are warmer than usual in the southeast and cooler than
usual in the northwest and northeast, according to the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The La Nina episode that began abruptly last May is expected to
strengthen during the rest of 1998, and to linger into March, April
or May, according to the latest forecasts. But experts say that the
effects of an extreme La Nina are harder to predict than those of
El Nino, and that the wintertime effects are not likely to be as
strongly felt.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Levey, a trader at Natsource, a company that sells a kind
of weather insurance to big companies, said that in recent weeks
the market has been betting that the winter will not be as severe
as previously expected. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in broad brushstrokes, here is what Dr. Gerry Bell, research
meteorologist at the National Weather Service's climate prediction
center, sees for the southern states: ``a drier, warmer and less
stormy winter due to the effects of La Nina through the spring.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma will likely be drier and
warmer,'' he said. ``Georgia and Florida will also likely be drier
and warmer. Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama will likely be
warmer, but near normal precipitation is expected during the months
of January, February and March. Arkansas and Tennessee will likely
be wetter and warmer.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His colleague Anthony Barnston said that the northeastern United
States, by contrast, can expect a normal to slightly colder and
wetter than average winter this year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents a major change from the very mild winter
experienced last year in association with the strong El Nino,'' he
said. ``What we're looking at with La Nina is a tilt of the odds
toward a colder winter in the Northeast with more snow and perhaps
bigger storms than usual.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Diane Konrady, a spokeswoman for the Vermont Department of
Tourism, has her fingers crossed: ``The ski areas are aware of
that, and of course they are hoping that wetter and colder means
more snow _ that would be great for us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The weather is also likely to be cooler than usual in the
northwest, the forecasters say. ``Deeper snowpack is likely this
winter in the Northwest, from the Cascades to the northern
Rockies,'' said Charles F. Kennel, director of the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography in San Diego. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, while northern Australia and Indonesia are prone to
drought during El Nino, they are typically wetter than usual during
La Nina. Monsoon floods are more likely in India. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While travelers can't do much if the weather takes a turn for
the worse, major tourism industries are now finding that they can.
Futures traders will sell to amusement parks, airlines and the like
what financiers call weather hedging, a form of insurance that
helps them shed the risk of an event like a nasty La Nina winter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Commercial airlines can lose huge amounts of money when there
is substantial snow or freezing rain,'' said Jerry Levey, a trader
for Natsource Inc., a brokerage firm that sells the weather
options. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And what is the market betting? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Four months ago the market was working on a perception that La
Nina would be prevalent and we would experience a very heavy
winter,'' he said. ``Over the past two or three weeks or month, you
have seen a marked deviation, that there may not be such a heavy
winter as expected.'' &QL;

 &HT;    SOCIAL SECURITY A POLITICAL FOOTBALL THIS ELECTION SEASON
 &HT;    740&AMP;add.
 &HT;    Eds: Updating and revising a story first moved Oct. 5.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ James Gorham has heard it all before, and it always
makes him uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   Retired at age 68, he depends on Social Security payments to
make ends meet, especially so he can afford the $210 each month for
his wife's medications. So whenever he hears politicians talk about
``saving'' the program, Gorham worries that any change might mean a
cut in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like one of those situations where Republicans and
Democrats are using it for a football,'' said the former city
worker, who supplements his income by working part-time at
Washington's Friendship Terrace Apartments.
</P>
<P>
   In this fall's congressional elections, candidates have raised
concerns about Social Security in races across the country. And
President Clinton, reaching for the issue that has served his party
so often in campaigns, is playing the Social Security card with
just a week to go until Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Clinton plans to take part in a round-table
discussion with women on Social Security and pensions.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has offered no concrete plan for reforming this
super-sensitive federal program, and the two political parties
earlier formed a pact to wait until after the elections to take up
the matter. The president last weekend announced a conference on
the future of Social Security for early December as part of the
search for a bipartisan solution.
</P>
<P>
   Amid warnings from some experts that Social Security's trust
fund will be exhausted in about 2031, the parties agreed to avoid
the issue this fall so they wouldn't be forced to renounce any the
limited options for saving it _ increasing taxes or the retirement
age, or cutting benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Social Security has emerged in connection with the budget
surplus. In his State of the Union speech last January, Clinton
pledged not to spend any of the expected surplus until there was a
plan to ``save'' Social Security. That effectively forestalled the
House Republican drive for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have responded largely by accusing the president of
demagoguing the issue. In a fax to reporters this week, they said
that 273 days after Clinton promised to ``save Social Security
first,'' he had yet to meet with Republican congressional leaders
to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proclaimed Saturday that the just-passed budget bill
``protects our hard-won surplus until we save Social Security
first.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual spending plan agreement struck by Clinton and both
political parties in Congress is more complicated, however. It
includes a $20 billion ``emergency'' package that would drain off
some of the $80 billion surplus predicted for the current fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some citizens dispute the assertion of a surplus. At
the Congressional Budget Office, the legislative branch's auditing
arm, spokesman Hank Cox said, ``We get occasional indignant letters
asking, 'Why are you saying you're in surplus?' ``
</P>
<P>
   The current surpluses come from excess Social Security payroll
tax payments, which are used to finance the rest of the government
that is continuing to operate in a deficit. Moreover, the first
overall federal surplus in 30 years is only a tiny drop in the big
bucket of the $5.5 trillion federal debt accumulated over decades
of deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the president and some Democrats have found the issue
of protecting Social Security and the surplus a welcome change of
subject from presidential scandal. ``Democrats have always been the
protector of the Social Security system,'' said Olivia Morgan,
spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
``When Social Security is the issue at hand, we have the home-field
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO has reinforced that message in a handful of races,
where they have run ads raising questions about whether a
Republican will protect Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nick Smith, R-Mich., came under such heavy fire from his
Democratic opponent for proposing overhauling Social Security to
permit more private investments and withdrew the plan.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, has jumped
to Smith's defense. ``No matter where one stands on these ideas, we
must begin to talk honestly about them in a forthright manner,
without resorting to partisan attacks and demagoguery during this
election year,'' said Stenholm, who has been criticized by his
Republican challenger for proposing an overhaul in the program.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In Cincinnati, Democratic Mayor Roxanne Qualls used Social
Security to help change the subject from the White House scandal in
her race to unseat Rep. Steve Chabot, a Republican. At a time when
other Democrats were keeping their distance from the embattled
Clinton, Qualls greeted the president and accompanied him around
her city on a fund-raising visit.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, she ran a campaign ad stressing her concern about
Social Security, a message reinforced by an AFL-CIO commercial
raising questions about Chabot's commitment to the program.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any such discussions trigger concerns among Social
Security recipients, who are caught in the political crossfire of
lawmakers whose own government pensions are far more generous than
those offered in private enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   When the policy-makers begin suggesting that the program needs
an overhaul and that benefits must be re-examined, recipients often
have a quick retort, recipients at the Friendship apartments had a
quick retort.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I both paid into it,'' said Elizabeth Tichenor,
a retired secretary whose husband worked until his death at age 70
and never collected from the Social Security system he had paid
into for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked hard, so that we would have something to live on
when we got old,'' she said as she sat in the dining room at the
Friendship retirement apartment. ``And thank heavens, because how
would we live?''
</P>
<P>
   Echoed Sheldon Martin, a retired insurance agent, ``Don't forget
that when we were working, we put into it.'' He added of Clinton's
promises to protect Social Security: ``I just hope that he says
what he means.''

COUNTDOWN BEGINS ON GLENN SHUTTLE FLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  (Science Times) 
(ll) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ With the countdown clock running and all
preparations on schedule here, the seven astronauts of the space
shuttle Discovery, including Sen. John Glenn, flew in on Monday
from Houston to get ready for their nine-day mission, set to begin
at 2 p.m. on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At a brief welcoming ceremony at the Kennedy Space Center
landing strip, Glenn stepped down from a T-38 jet and told
reporters, ``I have been pleasantly surprised at the outpouring of
interest in this flight.'' He said he hoped it would lead to a
renewal of widespread public support for space exploration.
</P>
<P>
   At age 77, Glenn is returning to space for the first time since
his historic flight in 1962, when he became a national hero as the
first American to orbit Earth. He has been a Democratic senator
from Ohio for the last 24 years, but he is retiring in January.
Because of his presence on the flight, more than 3,000 media
representatives have applied for credentials to cover a shuttle
mission that otherwise would have drawn a few hundred reporters and
television technicians.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery crew was an hour late in arriving because one of
its two-seat T-38 training planes developed battery trouble at a
refueling stop at Tyndall Air Force Base, near Panama City, Fla.
Glenn still flies his own small private plane, but this time he
rode in the back seat of a T-38, with Lt. Col. Curtis Brown of the
Air Force at the controls. Brown is the mission commander.
</P>
<P>
   The other astronauts, usually overlooked outside the Glenn
limelight, are Lt. Col. Steven Lindsey of the Air Force, the pilot;
Stephen Robinson, a mechanical engineer; Pedro Dugue, an
astronaut-engineer, and Dr. Scott Parazynski and Dr. Chiaki Mukai.
Parazynski and Mukai are physicians and will be conducting many of
the mission's biology and human physiology tests, in several cases
using Glenn as a test subject.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Kennedy center said the countdown for the
launching began at 8 a.m. on Monday and was proceeding smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``All is in great shape and we're right on schedule,'' said Doug
Lyons, the test director.
</P>
<P>
   But meteorologists gave the launching teams some cause for
concern, forecasting some clouds and rain on Thursday afternoon.
They predicted a 60 percent chance of acceptable weather for the
launching.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Football dad was eager to cheer writer son along
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The young man who walked into the biker bar in Ohio was
clean-shaven, well-spoken and uneasy. Not only were the
surroundings unfamiliar, but he was far from home. He wanted to ask
about a guy who'd killed a couple of policemen in Tampa and then,
barricaded in a Shell station, killed himself. He'd heard the man
used to come into the place.
</P>
<P>
   In the old westerns, conversations would stop when a stranger
walked through the saloon's swinging doors. There'd be a pause in
the poker game and a hand or two would discreetly poise itself on a
holstered pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Marietta, Ohio, is a blue-collar river town of 15,000. Ace
Atkins made a preliminary stop at Wal-Mart, where he spent $12 of
the Tampa Tribune's money on chewing gum, a size extra large black
T-shirt and a baseball cap. ``All they had were trucker hats and
the Chicago White Sox,'' he says. It didn't matter. Hanes and the
White Sox were better than the dress shirt and tie he'd worn on the
flight from Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, he was still overdressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know you're in a quality place when the men aren't wearing
shirts,'' he says. There was a guy with a leather vest. On the
lapel was one of those ovals that tell you a worker's name. His
said ``Mange.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter S. Thompson found out how much bikers like writers. The
Hell's Angels got tired of him hanging around and stomped him.
</P>
<P>
   You don't easily imagine someone trying to push Ace Atkins
around. He's not huge, but 6-foot-3 and 210 pounds isn't skinny.
Five autumns ago he was an undersize defensive end whose two
fourth-quarter sacks of Florida quarterback Danny Wuerffel
preserved victory for Auburn University.
</P>
<P>
   That was the magical football season Auburn people will forever
remember, just as they do the national championship season of 1957.
Nobody was expecting much in '93, but Saturday after Saturday the
War Eagles won _ all the way to 11-0. Not since '57 had an Auburn
team gone unbeaten. The come-from-behind victory over Florida was a
high point, and a full-page picture in Sports Illustrated the next
week showed No. 89 _ defensive reserve Ace Atkins _ flattening the
Gators' quarterback. His moment of fame came and went.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got out of football, I was sick of it,'' Atkins says.
</P>
<P>
   Now he was in this seedy bar in southeastern Ohio, among people
who couldn't have told you where Auburn was. It was nothing to them
that Atkins' dad, Billy Atkins, was an All-American, captain of the
'57 national championship team and later an all-pro with the
Buffalo Bills.
</P>
<P>
   The Ace Atkins who traveled to Ohio on assignment last May was
no longer a college football player but a 28-year-old journalist
and soon-to-be published novelist with a nose for the underside of
life. Atkins' mystery novel, ``Crossroads Blues,'' published this
month by St. Martin's Press, received a coveted starred review in
Publishers Weekly, a signal to book reviewers and others that it
was worth particular attention.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Atkins will sign copies of ``Crossroads Blues'' _
set in New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta, its story revolving
around the murder of blues guitarist Robert Johnson _ at a benefit
at the Ravinia Club, with proceeds going to a program to match
abandoned animals with abused children. The next evening he signs
copies at Chapter 11 on West Paces Ferry Road.
</P>
<P>
   It's a homecoming, of sorts. Seven years after Billy Atkins died
suddenly of a heart attack at age 55, Doris Atkins lives in
Dunwoody again. The life of a pro football coach and scout is
seldom spent long in one place. The Atkinses moved from St. Louis
to Cobb County and then to Dunwoody in the '80s. While his dad was
scouting for the Green Bay Packers, Ace Atkins was attending middle
school in Marietta and Dunwoody High School as a ninth-grader.
After spring football practice that year, former Dunwoody High
coach David Kelly mourned that the family was moving to Auburn,
Ala. In Billy Atkins' son, he saw the makings of another star.
</P>
<P>
   Many folks in Alabama _ where Atkins' name is not forgotten _
had the same expectations when Ace Atkins finished his playing
career at Auburn High School. He chose his father's alma mater and
then quit the day players reported to fall practice.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, he played no football. He wasn't sure he wanted
to be at Auburn, and he talked with coaches at North Carolina
State, Clemson and schools on the West Coast. All wanted him, but
in the end he decided he should finish what he'd started at Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   In those two years away from football, he worked out in the gym
zealously. But he was growing in another direction. He had always
read a lot. Now he had begun writing fiction in spiral notebooks
and finding a life away from football, something Billy Atkins never
knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize it at the time,'' Doris Atkins says, ``but I
think Ace felt pressured into playing football.'' The pressure
wasn't from the father _ not at first. ``I probably pressured
him,'' she says, ``because I knew it was important to his father.
Ace was always a good athlete when he was younger, but it was also
hard for him. If he did well, people would say, `Well, sure _ your
dad's in the NFL.' And if he didn't do well, they'd say, `You
should do better than that _ your dad's in the NFL.'''
</P>
<P>
   If he wasn't measuring himself against his father, others were.
</P>
<P>
   After he left Auburn to investigate North Carolina State, Doris
Atkins says, his father told him, ```Well, Ace, it's a fine school,
but that's not Southeastern Conference football.'''
</P>
<P>
   So it wasn't. But Atkins was finding that he enjoyed things
besides football. He remembers meathead assistant coaches at Auburn
who wondered why a football player would be reading novels. And
then word got around that he was even writing one. At practice, one
coach derisively called him the Poet.
</P>
<P>
   George Plasketes, who teaches film writing and screenwriting at
Auburn, recalls an athlete who was actually a student. ``One of the
things about writing,'' Plasketes says, ``is that there's a certain
amount of discipline involved. You can't just wait for the moment
when the muse speaks. You have to do it even if the words aren't
there. Ace had that. He had a level of maturity that was beyond
most students'. In my dealings with him, we didn't sit around and
talk about the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It runs against the stereotype of the jock, but Plasketes points
to such exceptions as Jack Kemp (a Buffalo Bills teammate of Billy
Atkins), former Atlanta Falcon Tim Green and basketball star Bill
Bradley. All had professional careers, but each has done far more
away from sports.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins had never met Green _ himself a published novelist _ when
he sent him his manuscript. ``He sent me back a 15-page handwritten
critique,'' Atkins says. ``I'll always be grateful for that. The
whole manuscript was marked up in red ink. He said he want

IMPENDING METEOR STORM PUTS SATELLITES IN DANGER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TODD ACKERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A spectacular meteor storm next month threatens to knock the
Earth back to the dark ages before cell phones, pagers and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   This year's annual Leonid shower, so named because the meteor
debris seems to emanate from the direction of the constellation
Leo, is expected to be the most intense barrage in 32 years. It may
also be the most destructive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This meteoroid storm will be the largest such threat ever
experienced by our critical orbiting satellite constellations,''
William Ailor, director of the Aerospace Corp.'s Center for Orbital
and Reentry Debris Studies, told the House science panel in May.
</P>
<P>
   Most scientists are reluctant to paint such a bleak picture. But
they acknowledge that between noon and 3 p.m. on Nov. 17, every one
of the 600-odd spacecraft orbiting the Earth _ mostly satellites
used for communications, military reconnaissance, weather
forecasting and navigation _ will be hit by meteor dust.
</P>
<P>
   Although the dust particles are smaller than grains of sand,
they travel so fast _ 40 miles per second, the equivalent of a
6-second flight from Houston to Dallas _ they pack the punch of a
.22-caliber bullet and could knock out or disrupt satellites'
delicate electronics.
</P>
<P>
   The last great meteor barrage came in 1966, when space
satellites were far less common and far less essential to everyday
life. Back then, 150,000 meteors shot across the North American sky
in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists predict 5,000 to 10,000 meteors an hour this year. In
nonstorm years, Leonid typically produces 15 to 20 meteors per
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for residents of Houston and most of the United
States, the show will be during daylight hours and thus invisible,
unless unusually bright exploding fireballs flash through the sky.
The best viewing will be in Eastern Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Meteor showers occur when the Earth travels through particle
clouds left by a comet. Leonid begins as dust or small chunks that
break loose from Comet Tempel-Tuttle when it approaches the sun.
Every 33 years, the ribbonlike stream of those particles trailing
the comet intersects the Earth's orbit around the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of particles is so great that every single
satellite will be hit,'' said Larry Pinsky, chairman of the physics
department at the University of Houston. ``It's like flying through
a rainstorm or having your car windshield collide with bugs on the
highway.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of major damage to any of the satellites is
regarded by experts as small but still significant. Concern about
possible damage has prompted many meetings to discuss the hazards
and the ways to minimize them. And though many operators are
playing down the risk, they are also taking no chances.
</P>
<P>
   After all, a European communications satellite named Olympus was
knocked out of operation in 1993, presumably by a meteoroid impact.
And earlier this year, uncontrolled spinning of Galaxy IV shut down
most pagers for a day and cost its company $2 billion, though it
was determined the problem resulted from internal failure, not a
meteoroid hit.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the greatest threats to satellites are sand blasting
and electrical. In the first, even without penetrating hits, the
hail of microscopic particles causes wear and tear equivalent to
three years of normal operation. In the second, microscopic
particles hitting the spacecraft are vaporized into a hot,
electrically charged gas that can short-circuit computer chips and
circuits.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of most operators will be to maneuver their
satellites so their big solar panels are turned edgewise to the
stream of particles, their vulnerable instruments are turned away
and many of their electrical systems are powered down.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, NASA plans to turn the Hubble Space Telescope away from
the storm so meteors will miss its delicate mirrors. The agency
also set the launch for Sen. John Glenn's Discovery mission for
Thursday so he would return before the Leonid shower and delayed
the shuttle mission for the international space station until after
the shower.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what we'll do with our 30 spacecraft is decided on a
case-by-case basis,'' said Nicholas Johnson, orbital debris project
manager at the Johnson Space Center. ``In some cases, the risk of
maneuvering or hiding spacecraft, which uses up a lot of precious
fuel, may be worse than doing nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the highest risk is to two solar observatories
hovering 1.5 million miles sunward from Earth. Situated at the
worst location in terms of the predicted intensity of the shower,
they have been given a 1-in-20 chance of being hit. The
observatories provide meteorological and astronomical information.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, PanAmSat, the largest provider of commercial
satellite services, estimates the probability of an ``adverse
collision'' to one of its 17 satellites in orbit as one-tenth of 1
percent. PanAmSat satellites relay television, Internet and other
communication signals around the world.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, this year's Leonid will be the best chance
yet to explore a meteor shower. Scientists from NASA's Ames
Research Center in California hope to study the storm from aircraft
flying out of Okinawa. The subjects will include the particles'
chemical composition and effects on the ozone layer and how to
design satellites that will better withstand meteor bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   The Ames team of about 30 scientists hopes to broadcast live TV
images of the shower over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters predict that there will be an even better Leonid
storm next November, though it will be visible only from Europe and
North Africa. After that, there may not be a good Leonid storm to
pose a risk until 2098. The tug of Jupiter's gravity on
Tempel-Tuttle's path is expected to move it out of Earth's path for
the next three 33-year orbits.
</P>
<P>
   But astronomers say those frustrated at not being able to see
Leonid in the United States can still catch a good show later this
month. The Taurid meteor shower, which follows the periodic Comet
Encke, may be especially dramatic on any clear, moonless night
until Nov. 10. &QL;

 &HT;    Curiosity may drive `Up' R.E.M. sales today
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although R.E.M. has sold more than 14 million albums since 1991,
neither Warner Bros. nor retailers is certain what to expect when
some 500,000-700,000 copies of the band's ``Up'' album arrive in
stores today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people will be curious to see what it sounds like''
because of the retirement of drummer Bill Berry, says Keith Medin
of Atlanta's Tower Records, which ordered about 150 copies of the
act's 11th album. ``It should be a pretty strong release. They
always do well out of the box.''
</P>
<P>
   In Athens, the group's home base, Dan Wall said Wuxtry ordered
about 200 copies, assuming ``it's going to be a hit.'' Wuxtry's
prices hadn't been set, but Tower's prices will be $13.99 for the
CD, $9.99 for the cassette and about $26 for the limited-edition
CD.
</P>
<P>
   Early reviews have been favorable (Cox critic Steve Dollar gives
``Up'' a ``B''), with most writers agreeing with
bassist-keyboardist Mike Mills' suggestion that it's an album best
appreciated through headphones. (Soundline number: 434)

 &HT;    PBS series shows some sexual abuse cases of children are being
overturned
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PBS's ``Frontline'' has made the alleged sexual abuse of
children something of a crusade. Or anti-crusade, as the case may
be.
</P>
<P>
   In the '80s, the United States saw a sudden surge in trials
involving sexual abuse of children, many involving elements of
alleged ritual Satanic abuse, day care centers, and repressed or
recovered memory. Fed by media frenzies and zealous prosecutors,
many people were convicted of the most terrible crimes.
Increasingly, some of those convictions are being overturned or
seriously questioned, and the metaphor of the Salem witch trials
has been raised in several serious books and magazine articles on
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frontline'' devoted eight hours to such a case in Edenton,
N.C., spread over three programs from 1991 to 1997, some of the
finest television documentaries ever made. But what made the
Edenton case so frustrating was that the true source material _ the
interviews between the young children and therapists that led to
the allegations _ were not videotaped or transcribed.
</P>
<P>
   Now the PBS series pursues a different but similar set of cases,
in Miami, in ``Frontline: The Child Terror'' (check local
listings), only this time, both transcripts and videos of
therapists inteviewing young children were made by the therapists
and were available. We can watch as the children are led to
``believe'' a dubious story by repeated and aggressive suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   The one-hour show weaves together three cases: a man who
apparently truly was a molestor, a teenaged boy who was acquitted,
and a policeman who was convicted and jailed, but whose sentence
was overturned because a higher court ruled the original evidence
was tainted.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently in such cases, the media, particularly local TV news,
plays a large part in whipping up public outrage, which increases
pressure on prosecutors. ``Child Terror'' shows dozens of clips
from local Miami TV, including one blurting out that police seized
candles and rope at a church where abuse had allegedly occurred.
The rope had been been used by the Boy Scouts who met there; the
candles by the Girl Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Child Terror'' is less successful in linking its worrisome
findings to Attorney General Janet Reno, who was the top prosecutor
in Miami at the time of the suspect trials. Although her office
bears ultimate responsibility if innocent people were tried and
convicted, the show has to strain to tie her in personally.
</P>
<P>
   But it makes too many other important points, and makes them
persuasively, for that shortcoming to detract.

   ``CHiPs patrolling the highways again

<P>
   The 70's NBC cop drama ``CHiPs'' explored the great oppositional
forces that bind the universe together in the guise of
crimefighters Jon Baker (yin) and his partner Frank Poncherello
(yang).
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it was just some mindless fluff about two cute guys in
tight pants riding motorcycles and busting bad guys in Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. Tonight, Ponch (Erik Estrada)and Jon (Larry Wilcox)
are back in the saddle for the curiously-titled, two-hour TNT movie
``CHiPs '99.''(8 p.m. EST).
</P>
<P>
   As hopelessly plot-challenged as the original, this
tongue-in-cheek reprise has hot-blooded Ponch returning to the
force after a mysterious 15-year-absence during which his
straight-arrow sidekick Baker has been promoted to captain and
gotten married.
</P>
<P>
   There's some nonsense about a gang of high-end car thieves
jacking autos to Mexico inside of a tour bus. And back at the
stationhouse, there's internecine tension between the old
Chip-sters and the new ones, played by David Ramsey and Paul
Korver, who seem to be bucking for their own series next season.
</P>
<P>
   It's an absolutely goofy bit of TV nostalgia, but at least it
gives viewers a chance to watch two former sex symbols squeeze
their capacious, middle-aged behinds into riding jodphurs and zoom
around Los Angeles one more time.

THREE-MEMBER R.E.M. TURNS IN VERY DIFFERENT DISC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ And then there were three.
</P>
<P>
   R.E.M.'s first album without drummer Bill Berry is due today,
and the introspective, brooding record presents many challenges for
the beloved Georgia band and its followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up'' (Warner Bros.), the band's 11th studio album, reveals an
R.E.M. with a very different dynamic than the one evident on such
early-'90s best sellers as ``Out of Time'' and ``Automatic for the
People.'' Since the remaining members _ Michael Stipe, Peter Buck
and Mike Mills _ didn't have a drummer, couldn't rehearse and
decided early on that nobody would play their usual instruments,
the album is R.E.M.'s most experimental effort yet, certainly more
so than the song-oriented previous disc, ``New Adventures in
Hi-Fi.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry was really the third departure since 1996 of a key figure
surrounding the group. First, manager Jefferson Holt bolted under
mysterious circumstances, followed by longtime producer and ``fifth
member'' Scott Litt, who launched a record label of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last October, after 17 years as drummer, harmony singer,
songwriter and sometime bassist, Berry got off the merry-go-round.
</P>
<P>
   You can call it an ``Up''-heaval. The band members certainly see
it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an enormous seismic shift for us,'' Stipe, 38, said.
``For Bill, it was a relief, but it made the process, which is
already difficult, even more so. What started out as an
experimental record got more experimental.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck gives a little more detail about Berry's state of mind. The
40-year-old drummer had survived a life-threatening fever in
Germany in 1989 and a brain hemorrhage in Switzerland in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was unhappy with the travel, and all the strange
places took the enjoyment out of it for him,'' Buck said. ``It
turned out that every single thing about the band had become
stressful for him. Bill didn't want to leave Georgia. The things
that the rest of us feel are perks of the job _ traveling, eating
strange food, visiting foreign cultures _ Bill's not that type of
guy. He wants food like he gets it in Georgia. He wants to sleep in
his own bed. I never imagined this would happen to any of us.''
</P>
<P>
   To start the album, Buck brought in his collection of keyboard
artifacts from the '70s: play-along home organs, Moog and ARP
synthesizers, and something called the Kitten, ``stuff I'd never
heard of,'' Mills says.
</P>
<P>
   The creaky yet somehow charming technology of the disco decade
tied in with '90s studio tricks such as looping, sampling and eerie
reverb effects. Drummer Barrett Martin of Screaming Trees and
Buck's instrumental side project Tuatara was hired to play vibes
and stand-up bass. Strange percussion from all over the world was
overdubbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process made it interesting for us,'' bassist Mills, 39,
said. ``I played guitar, 14 different keyboards. It was a lot of
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The members of R.E.M. have no plans to tour for ``Up,'' but the
band _ augmented by backup musicians _ will do some TV dates,
including ``Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' and ``Rosie O'Donnell''
next month as well as an appearance on ``Sesame Street'' in
January. At 9 p.m. Wednesday, MTV will broadcast an hourlong R.E.M.
concert taped last week at New York's Bowery Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most bands our age go out and celebrate their history by
playing their hits,'' Buck, 41, said. ``I really have no interest
in doing that. I'm just not ready to be an oldies, greatest-hits
act. I've seen it happen with the Who, the Stones. I'd rather not
tour at all and just make records. I don't know how to come to
terms with it.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, seven years after the band went to No. 4 in the
top-40 with ``Losing My Religion,'' R.E.M. has a diminished fan
base. Last year's ``New Adventures,'' recorded mostly at
soundchecks and on stage during the grueling 1995 ``Monster'' world
tour, took care of that by selling 5 million copies worldwide,
approximately 5 million fewer than the two R.E.M. discs that
preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite lavish praise for the moody and often beautiful album,
``New Adventures'' burned off 50 percent of R.E.M.'s global
audience, possibly due to Patti Smith's choice of an introductory
single, the ethereal, five-minute dirge ``E-Bow the Letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck says that choice ``killed the record stone dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the previous album, the 75-minute ``Up'' requires repeated
listenings to ``get'' the melodies, lyrics and the disc's ambient,
blurred mood.
</P>
<P>
   Even more worrying is the music-biz belief that the majority of
record buyers today are 15 years old and younger, with the patience
and musical acumen of gnats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the length is going to be a problem,'' said Denise
Sullivan, author of the oral history ``R.E.M.: Talk About the
Passion'' (Da Capo Press; $14.95). ``Traditionally, R.E.M. records
have taken a long time to sink in. I've never liked one on the
first listen. My guess is kids today won't want to listen to
something so many times. But on the other hand, this is adult
music, music being made by men who are around 40 years old. It's
not designed for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills, for one, says the audience deserves what it gets if it
doesn't want to invest the time it may take to understand and
appreciate the band's new music.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't want something that they might need to hear more
than once, let them listen to Celine Dion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1980 in Athens, Ga., R.E.M. marked the moment when
post-punk morphed into alternative-rock. In '81, the quartet's
first single, ``Radio Free Europe,'' sparked a back-to-basics
movement in American rock. With its ringing guitars, Stipe's
mumbled, cryptic lyrics and a do-it-yourself aesthetic borrowed
from punk rock, the band sounded at once traditional and modern.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, thanks to albums like the 1987 commercial
breakthrough ``Document,'' with its unexpected top-10 single, ``The
One I Love,'' R.E.M. moved from cult status to alt-rock
groundbreakers to become one of the world's most popular bands with
a string of chart hits that include ``Shiny Happy People,'' ``Man
on the Moon,'' ``Everybody Hurts'' and ``What's the Frequency,
Kenneth?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite many years in the music business, Buck, who lives in
Seattle with his wife and 4-year-old twin daughters, still
considers himself a fan first and foremost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when rock 'n' roll was the last bastion of
something that meant something,'' he said. ``Now, you see rock
bands with choreography. I remember when the only time you read
about the Rolling Stones in the paper was when they got arrested.
Music still means a lot to me. I take things away that ennoble me _
free jazz, for example. I walk away with my head on fire. Rock 'n'
roll has become catchy love ballads. I'm feeling more and more that
I don't fit in.''

<P>
   With a newly renegotiated recording contract worth $80 million,
R.E.M. left the crucial choice of a first single off ``Up'' to the
label this time. The result: ``Daysleeper,'' one of just two songs
here that sound like the ``old'' jangly-guitar R.E.M. In it, Stipe
adopts the voice of a resigned night-shift worker.
</P>
<P>
   Other memorable tracks include ``At My Most Beautiful,'' a
lovely, strings-sweetened ballad with luminous harmonies that owes
much to Brian Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started as a simple piano piece, and when I was in L.A.
last summer I wrote the first line,'' said Stipe, who is
co-executive producer of the glam-rock film ``Velvet Goldmine,''
opening Nov. 6. ``It took all of a year to fill out the rest of the
song. I wanted to write a straightforward love song without getting
sappy, without employing irony and cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't hear well-written love songs these days.''

GENETIC RESEARCH PIONEER TO RECEIVE WELCH AWARD FOR BREAKTHROUGHS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TODD ACKERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Pierre Chambon produced mice that had ear bones with
the characteristics of mammals and reptiles, or the way the mice
were about the time of dinosaurs. It was a backward move in
evolution, suggesting there may be some kind of genetic memory in
DNA that can be unlocked.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Chambon's other pioneering genetic research that has
contributed to applied breakthroughs: the creation of drugs that
kill only diseased cells, instead of all cells, in the treatment of
diseases such as cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most of my scientific career, I never cared about
applications,'' Chambon said. ``It was only when I first began
working with cancer _ I realized it was my duty to help people by
studying the molecular biology of these tumors.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambon, in Houston Monday night to accept the 1998 Welch Award
in Chemistry, is one of molecular biology's international stars.
The French scientist's numerous discoveries over 30 years have
unveiled some of the central mysteries of gene expression.
</P>
<P>
   He describes his work as ``trying to understand how the
information we get from our parents makes individuals like you or
me.''
</P>
<P>
   His work concerns the way basic information contained in DNA
develops into different types of cells _ such as brain cells or
liver cells _ and how signals in DNA control the way genes are
expressed.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest discovery involves breast cancer. He and his
co-workers identified a protein that has become a key marker for an
estrogen-dependent breast tumor. They later found an enzyme in the
tissues surrounding breast tumors that plays an important role in
metastasis.
</P>
<P>
   His other research includes the discovery that a derivative of
vitamin A is essential throughout vertebrate life in all tissues
and organs; that DNA expression requires three enzymes in animals
vs. only one in bacteria; and the cloning of the first gene for a
protein that binds to DNA segments.
</P>
<P>
   Chambon's experiment with mice ear bones merely proved the way
mammals evolved from reptiles. However, Chambon said it could lead
one day to people being able to generate arms or legs, if they have
been severed, the way amphibians do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other scientists are honored for one or two key areas of
discovery,'' said Richard J.V. Johnson, Houston Chronicle publisher
and Welch Foundation chairman. ``With Dr. Chambon, what is amazing
is the number of critical breakthroughs in which he's played a
leadership role.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambon exercises leadership at the Institute of Genetics and
Molecular and Cellular Biology in Strasbourg, France, the No.
1-ranked institute of its kind outside the United States. It is
there, a virtual empire built at a time when French science was
suffering from cutbacks and budget freezes, that Chambon stations
troops on the projects he leaves behind and starts new ones.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, built mostly with U.S. pharmaceutical money,
ensures that Chambon's research will be continued after he's gone.
But at 67, Chambon, an avid swimmer, skier and scuba diver, says he
is not thinking about retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still so much to accomplish,'' said Chambon, who
describes himself as surprised to win the Welch Award because he is
French and a molecular biologist.
</P>
<P>
   The Welch Award, which was presented Monday night in a black-tie
ceremony at the Post Oak Doubletree Hotel in Houston, is one of the
highest honors in science. The Welch Foundation awards the annual
$300,000 prize to recognize lifetime contributions in basic science
that have had a positive influence on mankind.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston-based foundation was started in 1954 with a bequest
by the late Robert Alonzo Welch, a Houston oilman. &QL;

`PUTTING IT TOGETHER' IS INTOXICATING SONDHEIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ ``I'll drink to that!'' sings Carol Burnett,
defiantly slugging down another highball as she makes her way
through Stephen Sondheim's sarcastic homage to society women, ``The
Ladies Who Lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   It's getting late at a posh Manhattan cocktail party, and
Burnett's character, a hostess with the mostest, is reflecting on a
lifetime's worth of betrayals and disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   Though Burnett's drop-dead glances and drolly acid inflections
are a hoot, there's no denying the heartache behind them. The
bitterness ringing through her voice could practically shatter the
windows of the fashionable condo &UR;  &LR; that Burnett's Amy keeps with her
faithless husband, Charles (John McCook).
</P>
<P>
   So it goes in ``Putting It Together,'' the exquisitely nuanced,
splendidly performed all-Sondheim revue that opened Sunday at the
Mark Taper Forum. Taking maximum advantage of the intimate venue,
director Eric D. Schaeffer and an excellent five-member ensemble
have fashioned a memorable, thoroughly grown-up entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   But beware: This inebriating blend of ultra-literate lyrics and
upper-middle-class romantic confession is a martini spiked with
hemlock. Caroming between hope and disillusionment, youthful
anticipation and later-life cynicism, the 34 musical vignettes just
barely manage to salvage a satisfyingly up-tempo ending.
</P>
<P>
   You know you're in good hands from the opening ensemble numbers,
``Putting It Together'' (from ``Sunday in the Park With George'')
and the ironically titled ``Rich and Happy'' (from ``Merrily We
Roll Along''). Snappily staged by Bob Avian, this deceptively
jaunty lead-in introduces us to two mirror-image couples: the
older, superficially enviable Amy and Charles, and the young,
optimistic yet still noncommittal Barry (John Barrowman) and Julie
(Susan Egan).
</P>
<P>
   The odd man out, known as the Observer (Bronson Pinchot),
functions variously as a butler, party guest and behind-the-scenes
puppet master, introducing the vignettes with silent-film title
pronouncements like ``Seduction,'' ``Flirtation,'' ``Desperation''
and so on.
</P>
<P>
   That's about it for a setup, and with a cast and material this
polished, it's all you need. For the next two hours there'll be no
escaping Sondheim's pointedly insightful repartee, or the
claustrophobic, trompe l'oeil perspectives of Bob Crowley's
brilliant set, a cluster of stacked, walk-in cubicles framed by a
horizontal Manhattan skyline.
</P>
<P>
   While the entire ensemble sparkles, Burnett is deservedly its
brightest star, with the supple, resourceful Pinchot a close
second. Burnett's comic timing is so perfect here, you suspect she
must've been an Olympic stopwatch in a previous life. Mastering
Sondheim's tricky internal rhymes and breakneck tempo shifts, she
pulls off such impossible numbers as the breathless ``Not Getting
Married Today'' with aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   She brings equally impressive emotional control to the wrenching
``Could I Leave You?'' ``Like It Was'' and ``Every Day a Little
Death,'' her devastating duet with Egan.
</P>
<P>
   In the ingenue role, Egan more than holds her own against her
feminine rival, brandishing her vocal claws in ``There's Always a
Woman,'' and innocently exulting in the consumer excesses of
``More.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrowman swings easily from swaggering to vulnerable,
unleashing his fine tenor on ``Pretty Women'' and ``Marry Me a
Little.'' And McCook, a latecomer to the cast, finds a gruff,
stirring regretfulness in ``The Road You Didn't Take.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without the editorial commentary of Wendall K. Harrington's
crafty rear-screen projections (exclamation points, ampersands),
Schaeffer's direction makes us feel we're reading the innermost
thoughts of a composer whose works need no subtext. ``Art isn't
easy,'' says ``Putting It Together.'' But in this case, it's well
worth the effort. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETMOLD, Germany _ When she arrived here seven years ago from
Kenya, looking for a coach and a manager, searching for someone to
take her seriously as a runner, Tegla Loroupe found that sexism
traveled without a passport. The man who would become her coach
joked to another runner, ``Is this your girlfriend?'' He had never
trained men and women in the same group. Women can be difficult to
manage, he told her. What if romance interfered with running?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Christian,'' Loroupe replied. ``I will not play around.
I want to show that I am able to run.''
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks, she cleaned house for other runners from Kenya
and Tanzania, cooked for them and washed their clothes. She was 18
and did not want to make trouble. She trained on her own in the
farm country of western Germany, looping through the hardwood
forests and the fields of hay and corn and sugar beets. ``I was
fearing they might send me home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks, it became apparent to Loroupe that she was
considered more of a maid than an athlete. When a runner demanded
that she wash his clothes, she refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``You left your wife at home; there are no wives here,'' Loroupe
said. ``We are all athletes. Wash your own clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the same refusal to capitulate that had carried her from
the village of Kapsait in western Kenya, where, like the other
women of the Pokot ethnic group, she was expected to live a life of
domestic servitude. Her father wanted her to work in the house and
in the fields of the family farm. She would marry early and have
children. He objected to her becoming a runner and did not even
want her to attend school.
</P>
<P>
   But her mother had grown up as an orphan and taught Loroupe the
value of independence. One of her aunts told her never to be caught
crying in front of men. Her older sister, Albina, told her that if
you don't own something of your own, like property, men will not
respect you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, one day I would have something unusual, something
different from other women,'' Loroupe said.
</P>
<P>
   And she would. Last April 19, in Rotterdam, the Netherlands,
Loroupe set a women's world record in the marathon with a time of 2
hours 20 minutes 47 seconds. On Sunday, she will attempt to win her
third New York City Marathon after taking back-to-back titles in
1994 and 1995. This year she could earn as much as $500,000, an
extraordinary amount for a woman from a country where women are
often treated like chattel. She has bought a farm in Kenya and
several houses that she rents to others; she wants eventually to
return home to start her own business.
</P>
<P>
   Her sister's admonition lingers. If you own something, men will
have to respect you.
</P>
<P>
   Loroupe, 25, has joined the vanguard of African women who are
dominating the sporting landscape now that they are being given
chances similar to those given African men. Derartu Tulu of
Ethiopia won the 10,000 meters at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona,
Spain. Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia won the 1996 Olympic marathon in
Atlanta, while Chioma Ajunwa of Nigeria won the long jump. Two
weeks ago, Loroupe's roommate and training partner, Joyce
Chepchumba of Kenya, made up a 19-second gap in one late mile to
win the Chicago Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was expecting women from Africa to be the best in the
world at something,'' Loroupe said.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet, and a listed weight of 88 pounds, which seems
extravagant, Loroupe appears almost frail and birdlike. A year ago,
her career seemed threatened by a serious back injury after a
disappointing seventh-place finish in New York. And her world
record has caused controversy because she was paced by two men.
Still, she has succeeded by the sheer force of her will, by running
through cultural stop signs, by ignoring what had been prohibited
and scorned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at her, and she's this tiny, tiny thing,'' said Anne
Roberts, who coordinates the elite runners at the New York City
Marathon and who has become a second mother to Loroupe. ``But on
the inside, she's Muhammad Ali in terms of strength and guts and
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Loroupe lives the ascetic life of a runner in a rural village on
the outskirts of Detmold. Four Kenyan women share a modest house;
Loroupe shares a bedroom with Chepchumba and has decorated her
corner with stuffed animals and photographs. The living room is a
sort of trainer's room, with an exercise bike and a massage table.
There is time for shopping, visiting and even helping the neighbors
bring in the hay crop, but mostly it is an austere life of eating,
sleeping and training.
</P>
<P>
   For about two months a year, Loroupe returns to Kenya. After New
York, she said, she will meet with President Daniel arap Moi to
receive an award for breaking the world record. But Kenya for her
is not a place for running. She could not find a reliable coach
there, she said. She feuded with the Kenyan track and field
federation over its treatment of her and other women, and she
overexerted herself at home, training three times a day with men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too much for me,'' she said. ``I got exhausted before
competitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is her popularity. There is little time for
training when she is home _ too many people to see, places to
visit, business matters to attend to. She is also concerned about
contracting parasites from the food or water, and about rising
crime, fearing that because people know she has money, they might
try to take it away. Twice she has been attacked while on long
runs, she said, once by a man carrying a knife.
</P>
<P>
   So she remains in Germany, coached and managed by Volker Wagner,
48, a pleasantly rumpled high school mathematics teacher who lives
with his parents. He has long coached runners from Africa, and
Loroupe said that, despite that first crude joke, she was drawn to
him by the professional way that he treated his athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many Kenyan athletes who have been exploited by managers,
Loroupe said she has set her relationship with Wagner on an equal
footing. ``The manager works for you; you don't work for the
manager,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Wagner said, Loroupe lent him money to buy a house
where other Kenyan runners are staying.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something inside that drives her,'' he said of her
running. ``It's like she is on a mission.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a career built on a foundation of resistance. Her father,
Loroupe Losiwa, wanted his daughter to live a traditional life in a
patriarchal society. From the beginning, Tegla said, she defied
this subjugation. ``I did not want to get married,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She sneaked off to school before breakfast, so that no one could
question where she was going. To her father, she said: ``I have two
arms and legs and I came out of the same stomach as my brothers.
Why can't we do the same things?''
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 12 she was sent to boarding school in the nearest
town, Kapenguria. There was one caveat. She could not be a runner.
She was a promising mathematics student, and her father wanted her
to concentrate on her studies. For six months, she stopped running.
But school officials insisted that sports were important. She faced
a punishment of having to run around the school track on her knees,
or even expulsion, she said. So she relented.
</P>
<P>
   As she became a national high school champion at middle
distances and cross-country, her father began to see the value of
running, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it was better that I was very hardheaded,'' Loroupe
said. ``He could have spoiled my talent. Now he's glad I didn't
listen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   After high school, Loroupe took college accounting classes and
became an auditor for the Kenyan postal service. In December 1991,
the postal service gave her permission to travel to Germany to
train. Even now, seven years later, she still nominally represents
the postal service and receives her auditor's salary.
</P>
<P>
   By 1994 she was ready to run her first marathon, in New York.
Taking Roberts' advice not to start too quickly, Loroupe won. She
won again in 1995. Running 26.2 miles did not seem so difficult,
considering she had spent much of her childhood hauling loads of
firewood and corn and younger siblings on her back for hours at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``African women know how to live with pain,'' Loroupe said.
``When it comes time to struggle, they don't quit. They keep
going.''
</P>
<P>
   A marathon is no certain thing, however, and her career grew
erratic. Her sister Albina, a guiding force in her life, died
before the 1995 New York City Marathon. Then Loroupe suffered
anemia and faded to seventh in New York in 1996. A year ago, she
finished seventh again, bothered this time by menstrual cramps and
back problems. Wagner began to hear criticism from other coaches
and managers that Loroupe was wearing her body down by running too
many races.
</P>
<P>
   Several days after the 1997 race, she was treated by Dr. Lewis
Maharam, a sports medicine expert in Manhattan, and was found to
have two serious stress fractures on her spine. She was advised not
to run for four months and not to attempt a marathon for eight
months. If she continued to run without treatment, Maharam said at
the time, Loroupe risked paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   She was fitted with a back brace that was to be worn 23 hours a
day. Because it was difficult to tell whether the stress fractures
were new or were healing, Maharam requested that Loroupe return to
New York in four weeks for further tests.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, however, German doctors cleared Loroupe to
begin training again. They found no stress fractures, Wagner said.
Saying that the back brace impinged on a nerve and sent pain down
her leg, Loroupe quit using it. She ran another marathon last
January, finishing seventh in Osaka, Japan. By April, though, she
had rehabilitated her back to the point that she set the world
record in Rotterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Maharam said in an interview and in a February letter to one of
Loroupe's German doctors that, upon further examination of Loroupe,
he believed she had suffered a chronic back problem from childhood
that was aggravated by a fall during the 1996 Boston Marathon. The
injury was nearly healed by the time of the 1997 New York City
Marathon, he wrote, adding, ``She is quite lucky no serious harm
came to her while running on this serious lesion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's come so far because she's worked hard,'' Maharam said in
an interview. ``If someone was not as focused on rehab as she was,
they might not have come back this quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Loroupe's world record was front-page news in The Nation,
Kenya's largest newspaper. ``She has inspired lots of other women,
given them the feeling that, `If this sister can do it, I can do
it,''' said Joseph Olweny, an assistant sports editor of The
Nation.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Masai, a Kenyan woman who now lives in the Netherlands,
said: ``She gives us a different story. Instead of just getting
married, you can develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was so jubilant about the record, though. Some
runners thought it unfair that Loroupe was paced the entire way by
two Kenyan men. (Ingrid Kristiansen of Norway, whose 1985 record
Loroupe broke by 19 seconds, was paced to the halfway point of her
run.) Loroupe's defense was, men are paced, so why not women? The
pacers were needed almost like bodyguards, she said, because male
runners gather around the leading female runner during a marathon,
hoping to get on television, and they tend to jostle her and clip
her heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still had to run the race,'' she said. ``If you don't have
your own energy, you won't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Loroupe's speed has had a slightly unnerving effect on Kenyan
men, who risk losing to her if they are not in top form. Several
years ago, in a half-marathon, she defeated Richard Chelimo, who
finished second in the 1992 Olympic 10,000-meter race.
</P>
<P>
   The night before the Rotterdam Marathon, a group of Kenyan men
pleaded with Loroupe, half-jokingly, ``Don't do to us like you did
to Chelimo.'' The next day she nearly caught Sammy Lelei, who, at
the time, owned the second-fastest marathon in history. ``I came
close to being beaten by a woman,'' Lelei said to Loroupe after the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next time, wait,'' she replied.

   Until he was 3 years old, Ryan Golden had his own understanding
of race: boys were white like him, he figured, and girls, like his
African-American sister, Nikki, had dark skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, one day, he was in the bath with Nikki and
another girl and he had the realization: not all girls are black,''
said Ryan's mother, Kathy Golden, whose North Olmstead, Ohio,
family has grown to include two younger Hispanic girls, Abby and
Jenna.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 15 and 16, Ryan and Nikki are far more sophisticated
about race, but still casual about the differences between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so used to being a minority in a white school, it's not a
big deal,'' said Nikki, the outgoing one. ``Some people make
comments, like `You act like you're white.' And I say, `That's
really dumb. You can't act like a color.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good answer,'' said Ryan, smiling approvingly at his sister.
</P>
<P>
   When Bernie and Kathy Golden first contacted adoption agencies,
in 1981, they were told that the wait for a healthy white infant
would be eight years _ but much less for a child from another
country, or of another race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started down the track for a child from India, expecting to
get a child in February 1982, but instead, the agency called and
told us about Nikki,'' said Ms. Golden, 40. ``I was pregnant with
Ryan when we got the call, but I didn't tell them, because I knew
we wanted Nikki. Race was never an issue for us. I don't know why,
given that we're both Irish Catholics brought up in a very white
world. But we just thought, yeah, we can do this. My parents were
less comfortable with the idea, but that vanished the minute we
stopped by their house on the way home with Nikki and opened up the
baby blanket.''
</P>
<P>
   While multiracial living is almost a hallmark of the Tiger Woods
generation, it is families like the Goldens, with children of a
different heritage from their parents, that play it out on the most
intimate level.
</P>
<P>
   Such families are both a measure of, and a response to, a
changing social climate that has begun to melt some of the
boundaries that define racial territory.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of interracial and interethnic marriages has been
rising steadily for decades, according to the Census Bureau, and in
a test of new forms allowing people to check more than one race,
many people under 18 used that option.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the whole notion of race is becoming more fluid,'' said
Claudette Bennett, chief of the bureau's racial statistics branch.
</P>
<P>
   But the process of choosing a child _ and which categories of
children to consider _ spotlights a family's deepest feelings about
race and culture. So it should be no surprise that race shapes the
adoption marketplace, as witness the bald fact that white children
usually cost more than black children, and that in the world of
international adoptions, Africa is almost ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 5,000 children were adopted from Europe,
more than 6,000 from Asia and exactly 182 from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a variety of reasons why people go to China for a
child,'' said Randall Kennedy, a Harvard Law School professor who
often writes about race. ``Part of it is that they can close their
eyes and imagine themselves the parents of a little Chinese girl,
but not of Shaniqua with the kinky hair. But another part, which
I've had white friends talk about, was the worry that given the
debate over transracial adoption, they'd be looked at coldly by
African-Americans if they adopted a black child.''
</P>
<P>
   Race also plays a role in decisions regarding the largest pool
of adoptable children, the 100,000 children in foster care in the
United States who need new parents. The black children who make up,
on average, 44 percent of those in state care are slower to be
adopted than the 41 percent who are white.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have families who say I'll take Hispanic, American Indian,
anything but black,'' said Joyce Wadlington, who is in charge of
recruiting adoptive families at the Cleveland child &UR;  &LR; welfare
agency. ``I don't know exact numbers, but I'd say only about 5
percent of the white families coming in are interested in black
children.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons that American families turn to
international adoption rather than the public agencies that handle
foster care. For one, foster children are generally older, and most
people are looking for infants. Then, too, many foster children
come with siblings. Some white families say they have been
discouraged from seeking to adopt foster children of another race.
And many would-be parents worry about the lingering effects of the
abuse or neglect that landed the child in state custody, and the
possibility of the biological family's reappearance.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost as though the universe of adoption comprises two
worlds _ one filled with couples looking for a healthy infant to
make them a family, and the other with older children in foster
care looking for parents _ whose orbits rarely connect.
</P>
<P>
   Adoption professionals say that many Americans have a
romanticized image of overseas orphanages, and an enormously
negative view of foster care _ the system this nation turned to in
preference to orphanages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are choosing international adoption because they
think that the children available overseas won't be abused, won't
be from a dysfunctional family, will be from a better background
than the children in foster care here, that's not necessarily going
to be true,'' said Nancy Ward, a supervisor at the Children's Home
Society in Minneapolis, which handles many international adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   Until the political opening of Russia in the early 1990s, most
children adopted internationally were Asians placed in white homes,
with Korea providing the largest contingent. But last year, for the
first time _ despite extensive publicity about emotional problems
among children adopted from Russian and Rumanian orphanages _ the
largest group, nearly 4,000 children, came from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always before, international adoption meant interracial
adoption,'' said Barbara Irvin, of Family Adoption Consultants,
outside Cleveland. ``In the good old days, I would stand up and
tell families doing intercountry adoption that they were about to
become a walking advertisement for interracial living, that they
would never walk into McDonald's unnoticed again. But that's less
true now.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Irvin said, however, that she was ``not always sure that
people who adopt a Caucasian child from Russia understand the
intercultural aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That child is Russian,'' she said, ``just like a Korean child
is Korean, and all children, whether or not they look different
from their parents, are curious about their background.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, there has been increasing recognition that
children benefit from feeling connected with their heritage. But
when the child's background is different from the parents', that is
a more complicated, and more self-conscious process. Though every
adopted child must deal with individual identity questions, those
who are adopted across race or culture lines also grapple with the
issue of group identity.
</P>
<P>
   The issues range from the cosmic to the quotidian: What if a
child adopted from Guatemala avoids the two other Hispanic children
in his class and says he hates the Spanish-speaking stores and
restaurants his adoptive parents seek out? Will a Chicago synagogue
be a comfortable place for a Chinese girl's bat mitzvah?
</P>
<P>
   Or, for the Goldens, who live in a mostly white suburb west of
Cleveland and run a wholesale window-covering business, how does a
white family learn about black hair care?
</P>
<P>
   ``When Nikki was a little baby, with little curls all over,''
Ms. Golden said, ``I took her downtown to a black hair shop, put
her down and said, `You have to help me learn.' They taught me
about oiling the hair, they taught me everything I needed to know.
By now, I can do extensions.''
</P>
<P>
   The deeper questions of racial identity are not so easily
answered. For the children adopted from overseas, there are new
institutions to bolster that connection. Korean adoptees can take
their pick of support groups, culture camps and guided homeland
tours of their birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   For American black and Hispanic children adopted into white
families, there are fewer formal supports.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do it yourself,'' said Ms. Golden, whose family
provided foster care three years ago for a biracial brother and
sister, until the sister's behavior problems became too disruptive.
``When Nikki was little, we would get together informally with
other white families who had black kids. And even now that they're
teen-agers, they stay in touch. It is important to have a racial
identity. Nikki was 4 or 5 when she started calling herself black.
We'd never told her she should call herself black, but she
identified that way very early.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Debate: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pros and Cons &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Of Racial Matching &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Recent changes in federal law have re-ignited a longstanding
debate over racial matching, an issue still throbbing with the
passions released in 1972, when the National Association of Black
Social Workers declared that placing black children in white homes
was a form of racial and cultural genocide.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Congress passed the Multiethnic Placement Act, making
it illegal to delay placing a child to find a racially matched
family, and emphasizing the need to recruit more minority adoptive
families. Two years ago, the law was changed again, making it
illegal to use race as a routine consideration in placing children.
</P>
<P>
   While the laws were touted in Congress as a means of cutting the
time children spend in foster care, many experts say that it is the
lack of interested families, not policies favoring racial matching,
that delays placement of older, dark-skinned children. The main
impact of the law, they say, will be to facilitate white families'
private adoptions of biracial infants.
</P>
<P>
   Many social workers of all races still believe that, when
possible, racial matching is in the child's best interest. But many
are confused about when and how to consider race in placements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a mixed message in the policy,'' said Madelyn
Freundlich, of the Evan Donaldson Adoption Institute in New York.
``On one hand, race and culture shall not be considered. On the
other, there shall be a lot of outreach to find minority families.
No wonder people who place children are very nervous about what to
say, worrying that they may be making a misstep, or being
scrutinized in such a way that it's a no-win situation to talk
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the concern is a growing body of legal battles,
including one now dragging through the Rhode Island courts, in
which white foster families and black blood relatives fight over a
child.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ward, who worked in the Detroit child welfare system before
going to Minneapolis, said her experience had convinced her that it
was difficult for white families to meet the needs of black
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be so in Europe, where the racism is different, but
here, I don't think most families are equipped to give kids the
coping skills they will need,'' she said. ``The history of racism
against blacks in this country is so deep, so ugly and so violent.
It's not that we don't have racism against Asians or Hispanics, or
that it's benign, or that white families are any better equipped to
help a Korean child fit in with Koreans, but in this society, that
has less severe consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you close your eyes and listen to African-American adults
who were raised in white families,'' Ms. Ward said, ``you would
think they were white. Things like that make it hard for them to
identify with the African-American community.''
</P>
<P>
   The Goldens agree that, when possible, a child should be placed
with a racially matched family. But they also say that their mixed
family has changed them profoundly, giving them a window on a world
in which differences are genuinely celebrated and race need not be
a divisive force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Becoming a multiracial family opens up your eyes to the
richness and beauty of all that diversity,'' Ms. Golden said. ``We
celebrate Cinco de Mayo, we have black baby dolls, we have Hispanic
dolls. It's really transformed me. I'm much more aware of all kinds
of prejudice. I used to be a person who couldn't talk to someone
without blushing. I was really shy. But when someone in Bible
school calls your daughter a nigger, you have to confront them.''

   &UR; Bound by Heritage: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bridging the Gaps &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; At Culture Camp &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For one week in July, Camp Idhuhapi, a YMCA camp in the
Minnesota woods west of Minneapolis, becomes Camp Tiger, a place
where dozens of teen-agers adopted from Korea gather to explore
their cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   In the dining hall, David Gross and Mia White are making mahndu,
Korean dumplings, spooning the meat filling into egg roll wrappers
and sealing the edges, while they talk about who has the neatest
dumplings and who did not answer whose letters over the winter.
</P>
<P>
   It is desultory conversation, but the setting carries a profound
charge for the young people who come, year after year, to spend a
week with others who share their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Tiger is led by David Yoon. Mr. Yoon, whose parents are
Korean, was born and reared in Detroit and has been bridging the
gap between Korea and the United States, adoption and immigration,
since his first trip to culture camp after fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to my first culture camp, I thought it would be
very different to be with adopted kids,'' said Yoon, now a
24-year-old high school teacher in New Orleans. ``And the family
life is very different. But there is a lot that is the same about
the experience of being Korean in America. That's the common
ground. I saw one girl arrive yesterday, with fear in her eyes, and
I knew she had never seen so many Koreans in one place before.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Camp Tiger participants said that while they enjoyed
the Korean cultural activities, what drew them to culture camp was
less what they did there than simply being with others who were
like them, in a way that their parents were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to an all-white school, and I've had my share of people
make fun of me,'' David White said. ``All my friends are Caucasian.
It's a tough life to be by yourself. I come here, and I remember
how beautiful Asian can be. It makes you feel better to be in an
environment where everyone knows what you've been through.''
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of culture camps scattered across the nation,
most of them for Koreans, the largest, and oldest, group of
international adoptees. Camps have sprung up for Romanian, Russian
and Chinese adoptees, including day programs for those too young
for sleepaway camp. In Minnesota, there were four Korean culture
camps this summer, plus Celebrate Romania weekend, and La Semana
Culture Camp for families who have adopted Latin American children.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp Tiger, while the teen-agers ate the Korean dinner they
had prepared, the parents who help out at camp talked about the
questioning their children had gone through, about the daughter who
said she would marry a ``regular'' _ that is, white _ boy because
it was easier, the son who only wants to date Asian girls and the
daughter who lay sobbing on the bed, asking why she had to look so
different that no one would date her.
</P>
<P>
   As a backdrop to the singing and cooking and games, the campers
share stories of being mistaken for the only other Asian around, of
wondering whether colored contact lenses would help them fit in, of
having people they considered friends make insensitive remarks
about their having slanted eyes or a flat face.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the older campers, and counselors, also Korean adoptees,
said their parents had done a wonderful job of rearing them and of
encouraging their connection to Korea: many learned of culture camp
while attending Korean dance classes or support group meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several said wistfully that they had sometimes wished for
parents of their same culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had kind of an identity crisis in junior high school, after
a bunch of Hmong families moved into my neighborhood,'' said Eva
Margolis, a counselor who is a student at Occidental College in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the Hmong students, speaking Hmong with their
parents, being who they were being, I was really jealous. For a
while, I just wanted to hang out with the Hmong kids and their
parents, and I kept thinking what it would be like if I had parents
who were the same as me. That's when I started teaching myself
Korean. I do think the best thing is if Korean kids could be
adopted in Korea. But that would only work if that culture changed
enough so that they would be accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bound by Choice: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Tough Journey &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To a New Home &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On a Friday afternoon in May 1996, the caseworker for Luis, a
10-year-old Puerto Rican boy, picked him up at school on
Manhattan's Lower East Side and took him to a spacious beige stucco
home in a New York suburb, where Charlotte and Scott, a white
couple who wanted to adopt him, were waiting to show him his new
room in his new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in with nothing but the clothes on his back,'' said
Charlotte, who asked that only first names be used to protect Luis.
``It's a day you never forget. You have this kid who crosses your
threshold, who all his life had been told to hate white people,
who's very vulnerable, and you immediately feel that he belongs to
you. He's upset, he's crying, and you have to comfort him, but he
doesn't know what to say, and you don't know what to say. What we
ended up with, what we talk about a lot, is how many changes he's
gone through, and how scary and confusing it must be. Then we went
to the Gap and bought him some clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis remembers the day, too. ``When they picked me up, I didn't
want to go,'' he said. ``They had to strap me down in the van. I
cried and did all that baby stuff. I'd never been in a house
before. I wasn't used to all the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, at 13, just back from a whale-watching camp, his
adoption finalized, Luis has a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels wonderful,'' he said simply, smiling out from the
flying-saucer toy he has stretched to frame his face like a
neon-pink crown. ``I trust them more, we talk more, we do things
together. They're my parents. Parents are someone that watches you,
that grounds you, and they're also friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis may not have come as far as children adopted
internationally, but his journey across ethnic and class lines has
been just as dramatic. Born in poverty on the Lower East Side of
Manhattan, Luis spoke Spanish until he was 5 and started school.
That was also the year he was removed from his parents' home, and,
after being shuttled around in foster care briefly, placed with a
Puerto Rican foster mother nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Luis knew little beyond his own neighborhood, and when he
arrived, Charlotte and Scott say, there was a lot of talk about
``you white people.'' They have tried to support Luis' sense of
himself as Puerto Rican, although, Scott said, none of the positive
stereotypes of Puerto Rican life _ extended family, strong sense of
religion, good food _ resonated with Luis' early experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wanted Puerto Rican food, so we ran around getting
recipes,'' Charlotte said. ``But when we served it, he'd say he
didn't like rice or beans or peppers. It turned out what he meant
he wanted was McDonald's. One Puerto Rican friend suggested a very
simple thing: if he says he wants to be a scientist, we say
something like, `The world needs more Puerto Rican scientists.'''
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic differences were never a serious issue in Luis'
adoption, and that seems right to Charlotte and Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe in an absolutely ideal world, where you would be
deciding which of many families should get to adopt a child, all
this racial stuff, about providing direct role models to help kids
develop self-esteem, would make sense,'' said Scott, who, sensing
Luis' craving for adult attention, spends an enormous amount of
time coaching his soccer team, helping with homework, even watching
him play video games. ``But the basic thing every child needs is an
emotional foundation, and finding someone who will be there for
that is a far more important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little demand for children like Luis, older children in
foster care, who often have medical or emotional problems.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 500,000 children in state care nationwide, about 100,000
need adoptive homes. But in 1995, the last year for which
statistics are available, only 27,000 were adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to do this because it's where the need is
greatest,'' Charlotte said. ``Most of our friends thought we were
crazy. Adopting an older child from foster care is not something
people like us are supposed to do. There's an assumption that
you're doing this because of infertility, which was not our
situation. And there's a perception that all the kids in foster
care are crack babies who are going to grow up to be drug
addicts.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte, 38, the research director for an educational media
company, and Scott, 39, a pension-fund manager who had worked in a
summer camp for emotionally disturbed teen-agers, knew not to
expect an easy adjustment, immediate bonding or perfect behavior.
</P>
<P>
   And it has often been rocky. At the beginning, especially, Luis
had frequent rages, in which he would call them names, fight or
break a window.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he first came, he was suspended from school for getting
in a fight,'' Charlotte said. ``I thought, `Oh my God, he'll be
marked for life as the bad kid from the city.' But he's very
sociable. And he made friends very quickly. He's an amazing kid.
He's amazingly resilient.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even for a resilient child _ and determined parents _ the long
adoption process took its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about adjusting to the child, which is certainly
an issue, but far more agonizing was having this bevy of social
workers and others in your life, and having the adoption, which we
were told would take about six months, stretch out to two years,''
Charlotte said. ``Until the adoption was finalized, we were just
foster parents, and if we went out of state, even to Newark
airport, we had to get permission. If he needed medical care, like
when he got the chicken pox, we couldn't take him to our doctor, we
had to go to the clinic where they took Medicaid.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, around the time the adoption was finalized, Luis'
behavior took a nose dive after having smoothed out some.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a really bad few months there, remember?'' Scott asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Luis says. ``I try not to remember bad things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was about the adoption being finalized,'' his
father says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Luis says. ``It took, like, duh, 20 years. It was
weird, to think that I was going to be changed forever. I didn't
think it was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   After the adoption, Luis went for the first time to visit his
previous foster mother, wearing his soccer gear and showing off the
trappings of his new life.
</P>
<P>
   He seems solidly and happily in place with Charlotte and Scott,
at ease performing on the piano or arguing with his parents about
which room he can use to watch ``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing, actually, the thing he can't disentangle in
his mind, is sorting out what's race and what's wealth,'' Charlotte
said. ``It's confusing. I travel a lot for work, so we took him to
Russia, and now he thinks that's what white kids do. For us, this
has all the rewards of any kind of parenting, like when he was at
camp, and he called and told us everything he was doing. That's
what's thrilling, being included in his life. There are these very
touching moments, like when we go to Boston Market, and he insists
that we get the family meal.''

   &UR; Bound by Blood: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2 Kinds of Family &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fight Over Boy &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If there is any single case that illustrates the intricacies of
how the Multiethnic Placement Act affects adoptions, it may be In
Re Justin, which has been making its tortured way through the Rhode
Island courts for more than two years _ half the lifetime of the
brown-skinned boy at its center.
</P>
<P>
   Justin was born to a Hispanic father and a 17-year-old black
mother who was living in foster care with an aunt.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was 13 months old, Justin has lived with Ronald and
Sharon Lapierre, foster parents who are white, and Eric, an older
boy they had previously adopted out of foster care. The Lapierres
want to adopt Justin, too, and the Rhode Island Department of
Children, Youth and Families has approved their petition to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But Justin's extended family wants him back. Justin's
grandmother, Linda Saxon, expressed interest in adopting Justin
soon after he was taken from his mother, who had a history of drug
abuse. But in 1996, Ms. Saxon died of a heart attack. Justin's
caseworker took him to the funeral, and after the service,
Christine Thompson, Justin's cousin and godmother, told the
caseworker that she wanted the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The fight for Justin has become a Solomonic tug of war: The
Lapierres argue that Justin's solid attachment to them must not be
disturbed, and that the research points to good outcomes for
transracial adoptees. Insofar as they raise the race issue, it is
to stress that under federal law, racial-matching policies are
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thompson does not frame the case as a racial one, but argues
that blood ties are paramount, that religion and heritage _ a word
some see as a stand-in for race _ must be considered, and that the
state public welfare office has unfairly failed to consider
Justin's extended family members as candidates to adopt.
</P>
<P>
   The competing claims are so strong that some experts in the case
recommended an unusual open adoption, with the Lapierres adopting
and Ms. Thompson having the right to visit. But Rhode Island law
makes no provision for such a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The case sounds many of the themes that mark the short history
of transracial adoption. Until the civil rights movement, most
adoption agencies did not serve African-Americans, and black
children whose parents could not raise them were generally cared
for, informally, by relatives or neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget that adoption agencies didn't start working with
black families until the late 1950s and 1960s,'' said Carol
Williams, who heads the Children's Bureau of the United States
Department of Health and Human Services. ``Then, with the civil
rights movement, there got to be a significant amount of placement
across racial lines, in the era of love is all you need. It was in
reaction to that history of exclusion, and that idea of color
blindness, that the National Association of Black Social Workers
said that identity is important, that race matters.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, when public welfare agencies pulled away from
transracial adoption, white families complained that
racial-matching policies were keeping them from parenting children
who needed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a predictable swing of the pendulum that got us to the
Multiethnic Placement Act, and then the amendments,'' Ms. Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth-Arlene W. Howe, of Boston College Law School, sees the new
laws as a way to give white parents easier access to the growing
number of babies born to unmarried white mothers and black fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new law on racial matching is really about helping white
parents to assert their right to adopt whatever child they
select,'' said Professor Howe, who has testified for Ms. Thompson
in the Justin case.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thompson, a single 27-year-old credit specialist who lives
in Cranston, R.I., stresses her continued relationship with Justin
while he lived with his mother, then in supervised visits she and
the mother made while he lived with the Lapierres, and finally, in
a few overnight visits from Justin that she was granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying a white family should never adopt a black
child,'' said Ms. Thompson, who was last allowed to see Justin in
March, ``but here you have a child whose blood relatives want him,
relatives who can give him a true sense of belonging. There are
thousands of children in foster care who desperately need adoptive
families. Why are they trying to take this child, whose family
wants him? Frankly, I can't imagine a case in which the headline
would read, `State Favors Black Foster Parents Over White Blood
Relatives.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Lapierres' lawyer, Keven McKenna, said that as foster
parents, his clients may not speak to the media. But they have
assembled an impressive list of experts on transracial adoption to
testify for them in the closed-court hearings that will soon yield
a decision one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transracial adoption is a tremendously complicated issue,''
said Kennedy, one of two Harvard Law School professors who provided
testimony backing the Lapierres. ``You're talking about kids,
you're talking about groups. And one of the uglier things that's
not often spoken of that's also going on is resentment of white
yuppie infertile couples. I've had people come up and say, `How can
you defend these people _ they've got everything else, now you want
them to have our children.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But what we're talking about is who is `our children,'''
Kennedy said. ``Black children, American children, all children?
When people talk about how tough it was growing up in a mixed-race
family, I always ask, compared to what? Weren't there any
advantages? Don't people growing up in a mixed-race family get a
different view of human possibility?''

<P>
   Until he was 3 years old, Ryan Golden had his own understanding
of race: boys were white like him, he figured, and girls, like his
African-American sister, Nikki, had dark skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, one day, he was in the bath with Nikki and
another girl and he had the realization: not all girls are black,''
said Ryan's mother, Kathy Golden, whose North Olmstead, Ohio,
family has grown to include two younger Hispanic girls, Abby and
Jenna.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 15 and 16, Ryan and Nikki are far more sophisticated
about race, but still casual about the differences between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so used to being a minority in a white school, it's not a
big deal,'' said Nikki, the outgoing one. ``Some people make
comments, like `You act like you're white.' And I say, `That's
really dumb. You can't act like a color.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good answer,'' said Ryan, smiling approvingly at his sister.
</P>
<P>
   When Bernie and Kathy Golden first contacted adoption agencies,
in 1981, they were told that the wait for a healthy white infant
would be eight years _ but much less for a child from another
country, or of another race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started down the track for a child from India, expecting to
get a child in February 1982, but instead, the agency called and
told us about Nikki,'' said Ms. Golden, 40. ``I was pregnant with
Ryan when we got the call, but I didn't tell them, because I knew
we wanted Nikki. Race was never an issue for us. I don't know why,
given that we're both Irish Catholics brought up in a very white
world. But we just thought, yeah, we can do this. My parents were
less comfortable with the idea, but that vanished the minute we
stopped by their house on the way home with Nikki and opened up the
baby blanket.''
</P>
<P>
   While multiracial living is almost a hallmark of the Tiger Woods
generation, it is families like the Goldens, with children of a
different heritage from their parents, that play it out on the most
intimate level.
</P>
<P>
   Such families are both a measure of, and a response to, a
changing social climate that has begun to melt some of the
boundaries that define racial territory.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of interracial and interethnic marriages has been
rising steadily for decades, according to the Census Bureau, and in
a test of new forms allowing people to check more than one race,
many people under 18 used that option.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the whole notion of race is becoming more fluid,'' said
Claudette Bennett, chief of the bureau's racial statistics branch.
</P>
<P>
   But the process of choosing a child _ and which categories of
children to consider _ spotlights a family's deepest feelings about
race and culture. So it should be no surprise that race shapes the
adoption marketplace, as witness the bald fact that white children
usually cost more than black children, and that in the world of
international adoptions, Africa is almost ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 5,000 children were adopted from Europe,
more than 6,000 from Asia and exactly 182 from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a variety of reasons why people go to China for a
child,'' said Randall Kennedy, a Harvard Law School professor who
often writes about race. ``Part of it is that they can close their
eyes and imagine themselves the parents of a little Chinese girl,
but not of Shaniqua with the kinky hair. But another part, which
I've had white friends talk about, was the worry that given the
debate over transracial adoption, they'd be looked at coldly by
African-Americans if they adopted a black child.''
</P>
<P>
   Race also plays a role in decisions regarding the largest pool
of adoptable children, the 100,000 children in foster care in the
United States who need new parents. The black children who make up,
on average, 44 percent of those in state care are slower to be
adopted than the 41 percent who are white.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have families who say I'll take Hispanic, American Indian,
anything but black,'' said Joyce Wadlington, who is in charge of
recruiting adoptive families at the Cleveland child-welfare agency.
``I don't know exact numbers, but I'd say only about 5 percent of
the white families coming in are interested in black children.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons that American families turn to
international adoption rather than the public agencies that handle
foster care. For one, foster children are generally older, and most
people are looking for infants. Then, too, many foster children
come with siblings. Some white families say they have been
discouraged from seeking to adopt foster children of another race.
And many would-be parents worry about the lingering effects of the
abuse or neglect that landed the child in state custody, and the
possibility of the biological family's reappearance.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost as though the universe of adoption comprises two
worlds _ one filled with couples looking for a healthy infant to
make them a family, and the other with older children in foster
care looking for parents _ whose orbits rarely connect.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, there has been increasing recognition that
children benefit from feeling connected with their heritage. But
when the child's background is different from the parents', that is
a more complicated, and more self-conscious process. Though every
adopted child must deal with individual identity questions, those
who are adopted across race or culture lines also grapple with the
issue of group identity.
</P>
<P>
   The issues range from the cosmic to the quotidian: What if a
child adopted from Guatemala avoids the two other Hispanic children
in his class and says he hates the Spanish-speaking stores and
restaurants his adoptive parents seek out? Will a Chicago synagogue
be a comfortable place for a Chinese girl's bat mitzvah?
</P>
<P>
   Or, for the Goldens, who live in a mostly white suburb west of
Cleveland and run a wholesale window-covering business, how does a
white family learn about black hair care?
</P>
<P>
   ``When Nikki was a little baby, with little curls all over,''
Ms. Golden said, ``I took her downtown to a black hair shop, put
her down and said, `You have to help me learn.' They taught me
about oiling the hair, they taught me everything I needed to know.
By now, I can do extensions.''
</P>
<P>
   The deeper questions of racial identity are not so easily
answered. For the children adopted from overseas, there are new
institutions to bolster that connection. Korean adoptees can take
their pick of support groups, culture camps and guided homeland
tours of their birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   For American black and Hispanic children adopted into white
families, there are fewer formal supports.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do it yourself,'' said Ms. Golden, whose family
provided foster care three years ago for a biracial brother and
sister, until the sister's behavior problems became too disruptive.
``When Nikki was little, we would get together informally with
other white families who had black kids. And even now that they're
teen-agers, they stay in touch. It is important to have a racial
identity. Nikki was 4 or 5 when she started calling herself black.
We'd never told her she should call herself black, but she
identified that way very early.''

CLINTON SEX SCANDAL ISN'T AN ELECTION ISSUE IN GREEN BAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Filed in ``a'' and ``p'' categories.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ Rep. Jay Johnson, D-Wis., struggling to win a
second term representing the dairy farmers, paper mill workers and
Packer fans here in northeastern Wisconsin, agonized earlier this
month as the House voted on the impeachment inquiry into President
Clinton's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out he needn't have worried.
</P>
<P>
   A week from Election Day, the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal is
barely registering a pulse here. If it comes up on the campaign
trail at all, ``it's usually brought up by news people,'' said
Johnson, 55, a former local TV news anchor and the district's first
Democratic representative in 18 years. ``My opponent and I agree on
at least one thing: It's a minor factor in this race.''
</P>
<P>
   His opponent, GOP state representative Mark Green, 38, dismisses
the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton ``a huge
distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson recalls that he was nervous back on Oct. 8 when he
joined fellow Democrats in voting for an impeachment inquiry that
set a Dec. 31 deadline and limited the scope to whether Clinton
lied or obstructed justice in the Monica Lewinsky matter. After
that resolution went down to defeat 198-236, Johnson voted against
the GOP version with no limits on time or subject matter. The
Republican resolution passed 258-176.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he believes his votes were ``the right thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, a telegenic lawyer who frequently campaigns in a green
pullover sweater, disagrees with Johnson's votes and has called on
Clinton to resign. But he is loathe to make an issue out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most voters have made up their minds as to how
(impeachment) affects them, whether they're going to vote, how
they're going to vote,'' Green said. ``The last thing they need is
me telling them anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added, ``I'm a challenger. I have to work extra hard
to get my message out. When the dominant story in the news is not
`Green unveils new crime proposal' but `Linda Tripp's testimony,'
it's a distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   On a campaign stop at a school in Shiocton, Wis. last week,
impeachment evoked no questions from the sixth-through-eighth grade
audience until the discussion moved to sex and violence on
television. Asked what he thought, Green repeated his view: ``I
think it's time to move along and get at other issues. I think the
president should resign.''
</P>
<P>
   The only voter who raised the sex scandal with Green was Terry
Scheller, a night-shift worker wearing a Packers jacket and hat.
After the school session, he came up to Green to rail about
Clinton's behavior with Lewinsky. ``Hey, there's 125 people sitting
in federal prison for lying under oath,'' he said. ``What are we
saying, it's OK to lie?''
</P>
<P>
   Scheller said he has ``never voted for a Democrat in my life.''
Asked whether the Lewinsky scandal is influencing his vote,
Scheller said he would vote for Green even if Clinton's affair with
Lewinsky had never come up.
</P>
<P>
   Green's strategy is to paint Johnson as out of touch with the
district's political profile: Blue-collar conservative, between 65
percent and 70 percent Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people voted for Jay two years ago, they thought they
were getting a populist, centrist Democrat,'' Green said. ``What's
happened is people are becoming increasingly disappointed with his
voting record.''
</P>
<P>
   Green wants to scrap the tax code and criticizes Johnson for
voting this year to keep the current system. Green opposes legal
abortion while Johnson supports it.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson supported a ban on partial-birth abortion that was
vetoed by Clinton. He also voted for the constitutional amendment
to outlaw flag burning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've represented this district well, and I defy
anybody to find a vote that doesn't really represent the vast
majority in this district.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Republicans and Democrats have targeted Wisconsin's 8th
district for special attention, blanketing the region with
not-too-subtle issue ads.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Green campaign is part of the National
Republican Campaign Committee's ``Operation Breakout'' nationwide
advertising offensive. The ads accuse Clinton of ``double talk'' on
budget issues and implore voters to ``call Mark Green and tell him
cutting taxes and saving Social Security are important.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Wisconsin Democratic Party launched a last-minute
TV ad blitz for Johnson built around the party's positions on
saving Social Security and regulating managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Green has received nearly $60,000 from political action
committees representing business interests. But organized Labor has
pumped $211,000 into the Johnson campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO has sent organizers into the district to work with
local union officials to get out the vote for Johnson. There are
about 40,000 union members in the district, many of them in paper
mills and factories that produce machinery for the paper industry.
Unions are working phone banks and leafleting plant gates for
Johnson. One such glossy pamphlet announces that construction
workers are ``revving their engines for Jay Johnson!''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is expose Mark Green for what he is, a
right-wing Republican,'' said Dan Cole, business manager for local
eight of the ironworkers' union. ``I haven't heard anyone say
anything about Monica Lewinsky.''

</P>
<P>
   Both candidates compete in their public affection for the Green
Bay Packers, the state's NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson won his first term in 1996, which also was a great
season for the Packers that earned them a Super Bowl trip and
victory over the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Green is trying not to be outflanked on Packer-mania, passing
out the team's schedule inside a ``Mark Green for Congress'' card,
and wearing his trademark Packer green as a reminder.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the Packers are 5-2 with a key game at home
against the San Francisco 49ers this Sunday, two days before
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole mood of the region changes with the Packers,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled how in 1996, he got First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton to utter his favorite prediction during a campaign
appearance: In January, ``Jay Johnson will be sworn in as a member
of Congress and the Packers will win the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Both came to pass. This year, ``the same dynamics are in play,''
Johnson said. ``Only this time, it's going to be tougher for both
of us.''

 UNDATED: very early.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Goldens agree that, when possible, a child should be placed
with a racially matched family. But they also say that their mixed
family has changed them profoundly, giving them a window on a world
in which differences are genuinely celebrated and race need not be
a divisive force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Becoming a multiracial family opens up your eyes to the
richness and beauty of all that diversity,'' Ms. Golden said. ``We
celebrate Cinco de Mayo, we have black baby dolls, we have Hispanic
dolls. It's really transformed me. I'm much more aware of all kinds
of prejudice. I used to be a person who couldn't talk to someone
without blushing. I was really shy. But when someone in Bible
school calls your daughter a nigger, you have to confront them.''
</P>
<P>
   For one week in July, Camp Idhuhapi, a YMCA camp in the
Minnesota woods west of Minneapolis, becomes Camp Tiger, a place
where dozens of teen-agers adopted from Korea gather to explore
their cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   In the dining hall, David Gross and Mia White are making mahndu,
Korean dumplings, spooning the meat filling into egg roll wrappers
and sealing the edges, while they talk about who has the neatest
dumplings and who did not answer whose letters over the winter.
</P>
<P>
   It is desultory conversation, but the setting carries a profound
charge for the young people who come, year after year, to spend a
week with others who share their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Tiger is led by David Yoon. Mr. Yoon, whose parents are
Korean, was born and reared in Detroit and has been bridging the
gap between Korea and the United States, adoption and immigration,
since his first trip to culture camp after fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to my first culture camp, I thought it would be
very different to be with adopted kids,'' said Yoon, now a
24-year-old high school teacher in New Orleans. ``And the family
life is very different. But there is a lot that is the same about
the experience of being Korean in America. That's the common
ground. I saw one girl arrive yesterday, with fear in her eyes, and
I knew she had never seen so many Koreans in one place before.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Camp Tiger participants said that while they enjoyed
the Korean cultural activities, what drew them to culture camp was
less what they did there than simply being with others who were
like them, in a way that their parents were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to an all-white school, and I've had my share of people
make fun of me,'' David White said. ``All my friends are Caucasian.
It's a tough life to be by yourself. I come here, and I remember
how beautiful Asian can be. It makes you feel better to be in an
environment where everyone knows what you've been through.''
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of culture camps scattered across the nation,
most of them for Koreans, the largest, and oldest, group of
international adoptees. Camps have sprung up for Romanian, Russian
and Chinese adoptees, including day programs for those too young
for sleepaway camp. In Minnesota, there were four Korean culture
camps this summer, plus Celebrate Romania weekend, and La Semana
Culture Camp for families who have adopted Latin American children.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp Tiger, while the teen-agers ate the Korean dinner they
had prepared, the parents who help out at camp talked about the
questioning their children had gone through, about the daughter who
said she would marry a ``regular'' _ that is, white _ boy because
it was easier, the son who only wants to date Asian girls and the
daughter who lay sobbing on the bed, asking why she had to look so
different that no one would date her.
</P>
<P>
   As a backdrop to the singing and cooking and games, the campers
share stories of being mistaken for the only other Asian around, of
wondering whether colored contact lenses would help them fit in, of
having people they considered friends make insensitive remarks
about their having slanted eyes or a flat face.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the older campers, and counselors, also Korean adoptees,
said their parents had done a wonderful job of raising them and of
encouraging their connection to Korea: many learned of culture camp
while attending Korean dance classes or support group meetings.
</P>
<P>
   On a Friday afternoon in May 1996, the caseworker for Luis, a
10-year-old Puerto Rican boy, picked him up at school on
Manhattan's Lower East Side and took him to a spacious beige stucco
home in a New York suburb, where Charlotte and Scott, a white
couple who wanted to adopt him, were waiting to show him his new
room in his new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in with nothing but the clothes on his back,'' said
Charlotte, who asked that only first names be used to protect Luis.
``It's a day you never forget. You have this kid who crosses your
threshold, who all his life had been told to hate white people,
who's very vulnerable, and you immediately feel that he belongs to
you. He's upset, he's crying, and you have to comfort him, but he
doesn't know what to say, and you don't know what to say. What we
ended up with, what we talk about a lot, is how many changes he's
gone through, and how scary and confusing it must be. Then we went
to the Gap and bought him some clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis remembers the day, too. ``When they picked me up, I didn't
want to go,'' he said. ``They had to strap me down in the van. I
cried and did all that baby stuff. I'd never been in a house
before. I wasn't used to all the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, at 13, just back from a whale-watching camp, his
adoption finalized, Luis has a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels wonderful,'' he said simply, smiling out from the
flying-saucer toy he has stretched to frame his face like a
neon-pink crown. ``I trust them more, we talk more, we do things
together. They're my parents. Parents are someone that watches you,
that grounds you, and they're also friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis may not have come as far as children adopted
internationally, but his journey across ethnic and class lines has
been just as dramatic. Born in poverty on the Lower East Side of
Manhattan, Luis spoke Spanish until he was 5 and started school.
That was also the year he was removed from his parents' home, and,
after being shuttled around in foster care briefly, placed with a
Puerto Rican foster mother nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Luis knew little beyond his own neighborhood, and when he
arrived, Charlotte and Scott say, there was a lot of talk about
``you white people.'' They have tried to support Luis' sense of
himself as Puerto Rican, although, Scott said, none of the positive
stereotypes of Puerto Rican life _ extended family, strong sense of
religion, good food _ resonated with Luis' early experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wanted Puerto Rican food, so we ran around getting
recipes,'' Charlotte said. ``But when we served it, he'd say he
didn't like rice or beans or peppers. It turned out what he meant
he wanted was McDonald's. One Puerto Rican friend suggested a very
simple thing: if he says he wants to be a scientist, we say
something like, `The world needs more Puerto Rican scientists.'''
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic differences were never a serious issue in Luis'
adoption, and that seems right to Charlotte and Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe in an absolutely ideal world, where you would be
deciding which of many families should get to adopt a child, all
this racial stuff, about providing direct role models to help kids
develop self-esteem, would make sense,'' said Scott, who, sensing
Luis' craving for adult attention, spends an enormous amount of
time coaching his soccer team, helping with homework, even watching
him play video games. ``But the basic thing every child needs is an
emotional foundation, and finding someone who will be there for
that is a far more important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis seems solidly and happily in place with Charlotte and
Scott, at ease performing on the piano or arguing with his parents
about which room he can use to watch ``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing, actually, the thing he can't disentangle in
his mind, is sorting out what's race and what's wealth,'' Charlotte
said. ``It's confusing. I travel a lot for work, so we took him to
Russia, and now he thinks that's what white kids do. For us, this
has all the rewards of any kind of parenting, like when he was at
camp, and he called and told us everything he was doing. That's
what's thrilling, being included in his life. There are these very
touching moments, like when we go to Boston Market, and he insists
that we get the family meal.''

CLINTON SEX SCANDAL ISN'T AN ELECTION ISSUE IN GREEN BAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Filed in ``a'' and ``p'' categories.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ Rep. Jay Johnson, D-Wis., struggling to win a
second term representing the dairy farmers, paper mill workers and
Packer fans here in northeastern Wisconsin, agonized earlier this
month as the House voted on the impeachment inquiry into President
Clinton's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out he needn't have worried.
</P>
<P>
   A week from Election Day, the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal is
barely registering a pulse here. If it comes up on the campaign
trail at all, ``it's usually brought up by news people,'' said
Johnson, 55, a former local TV news anchor and the district's first
Democratic representative in 18 years. ``My opponent and I agree on
at least one thing: It's a minor factor in this race.''
</P>
<P>
   His opponent, GOP state representative Mark Green, 38, dismisses
the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton ``a huge
distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson recalls that he was nervous back on Oct. 8 when he
joined fellow Democrats in voting for an impeachment inquiry that
set a Dec. 31 deadline and limited the scope to whether Clinton
lied or obstructed justice in the Monica Lewinsky matter. After
that resolution went down to defeat 198-236, Johnson voted against
the GOP version with no limits on time or subject matter. The
Republican resolution passed 258-176.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he believes his votes were ``the right thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, a telegenic lawyer who frequently campaigns in a green
pullover sweater, disagrees with Johnson's votes and has called on
Clinton to resign. But he is loathe to make an issue out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most voters have made up their minds as to how
(impeachment) affects them, whether they're going to vote, how
they're going to vote,'' Green said. ``The last thing they need is
me telling them anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added, ``I'm a challenger. I have to work extra hard
to get my message out. When the dominant story in the news is not
`Green unveils new crime proposal' but `Linda Tripp's testimony,'
it's a distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   On a campaign stop at a school in Shiocton, Wis. last week,
impeachment evoked no questions from the sixth-through-eighth grade
audience until the discussion moved to sex and violence on
television. Asked what he thought, Green repeated his view: ``I
think it's time to move along and get at other issues. I think the
president should resign.''
</P>
<P>
   The only voter who raised the sex scandal with Green was Terry
Scheller, a night-shift worker wearing a Packers jacket and hat.
After the school session, he came up to Green to rail about
Clinton's behavior with Lewinsky. ``Hey, there's 125 people sitting
in federal prison for lying under oath,'' he said. ``What are we
saying, it's OK to lie?''
</P>
<P>
   Scheller said he has ``never voted for a Democrat in my life.''
Asked whether the Lewinsky scandal is influencing his vote,
Scheller said he would vote for Green even if Clinton's affair with
Lewinsky had never come up.
</P>
<P>
   Green's strategy is to paint Johnson as out of touch with the
district's political profile: Blue-collar conservative, between 65
percent and 70 percent Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people voted for Jay two years ago, they thought they
were getting a populist, centrist Democrat,'' Green said. ``What's
happened is people are becoming increasingly disappointed with his
voting record.''
</P>
<P>
   Green wants to scrap the tax code and criticizes Johnson for
voting this year to keep the current system. Green opposes legal
abortion while Johnson supports it.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson supported a ban on partial-birth abortion that was
vetoed by Clinton. He also voted for the constitutional amendment
to outlaw flag burning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've represented this district well, and I defy
anybody to find a vote that doesn't really represent the vast
majority in this district.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Republicans and Democrats have targeted Wisconsin's 8th
district for special attention, blanketing the region with
not-too-subtle issue ads.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Green campaign is part of the National
Republican Campaign Committee's ``Operation Breakout'' nationwide
advertising offensive. The ads accuse Clinton of ``double talk'' on
budget issues and implore voters to ``call Mark Green and tell him
cutting taxes and saving Social Security are important.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Wisconsin Democratic Party launched a last-minute
TV ad blitz for Johnson built around the party's positions on
saving Social Security and regulating managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Green has received nearly $60,000 from political action
committees representing business interests. But organized Labor has
pumped $211,000 into the Johnson campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO has sent organizers into the district to work with
local union officials to get out the vote for Johnson. There are
about 40,000 union members in the district, many of them in paper
mills and factories that produce machinery for the paper industry.
Unions are working phone banks and leafleting plant gates for
Johnson. One such glossy pamphlet announces that construction
workers are ``revving their engines for Jay Johnson!''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is expose Mark Green for what he is, a
right-wing Republican,'' said Dan Cole, business manager for local
eight of the ironworkers' union. ``I haven't heard anyone say
anything about Monica Lewinsky.''

</P>
<P>
   Both candidates compete in their public affection for the Green
Bay Packers, the state's NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson won his first term in 1996, which also was a great
season for the Packers that earned them a Super Bowl trip and
victory over the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Green is trying not to be outflanked on Packer-mania, passing
out the team's schedule inside a ``Mark Green for Congress'' card,
and wearing his trademark Packer green as a reminder.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the Packers are 5-2 with a key game at home
against the San Francisco 49ers this Sunday, two days before
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole mood of the region changes with the Packers,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled how in 1996, he got First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton to utter his favorite prediction during a campaign
appearance: In January, ``Jay Johnson will be sworn in as a member
of Congress and the Packers will win the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Both came to pass. This year, ``the same dynamics are in play,''
Johnson said. ``Only this time, it's going to be tougher for both
of us.''

 &HT;    Q&AMP;A with Chipper Jones
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Chipper and Karin Jones have no interest in
continually revisiting the indiscretions that nearly ruined their
marriage. Baseball does not produce matrimonial scandal often, but
when one comes along, the results can be devastating. Ask Wade
Boggs.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones said his confession last week to several past affairs
and a child born out of wedlock has made his marriage stronger,
after it nearly ruined it. Chipper Jones took the time on Monday to
talk about what the couple has gone through with staff writer
Thomas Stinson.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What made you come forward with your story when you did? What
was the timing involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, it was the fact Karin and I felt like we could handle
it. Time has passed, and we were sort of at peace with it. I think
another reason was, it was after the season was over. I didn't want
to cause a distraction to the team. I think we've seen in the past
where we've had some things come up that have had a tendency to
affect the team.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was this a well-kept secret within the team?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'd say half the guys knew. I don't know. I didn't poll them.
It really wasn't something that was that well known or that I
talked about very often.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've kind of reversed the cycle here by telling your story
and then excusing yourself from the public eye. Usually it's the
other way around. How calculating have you been about how this
story become public?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'll be as calculating as I can. My public appearances will
probably be cut way down until I feel a bit more comfortable with
how people respond. I'm going to be a bit more reclusive. I don't
really know how people are going to react or how they'll accept me.
I will say in the last four or five days, the few strangers that
have come up have been very receptive about Karin and (me) working
this out and sympathetic about the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you think this will impact your career?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't really know how this will really affect me. I mean, I
listen to WSB and read your newspaper. I know I've disappointed
people, and I don't really blame anybody who feels that way. It's
not going to affect the stats I put up or my approach to the game.
But when they announce my name over the loudspeaker, I'll still
feel the embarrassment I've gone through. I know some people feel
I've let them down, and I'm not so sure I wouldn't feel the same
way. I can't really blame anybody. All I can do is hope people can
trust that this is behind us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How, if at all, does this affect your plans to remain in this
city with the Braves? Your contract is up after next year.
</P>
<P>
   A: It doesn't affect it at all. I'm a Brave through and through.
This is the only team I've ever played for. I want to stay here as
long as they want me. Now, all that being said, if they start to
think of me the way some of my ad endorsements are starting to,
then maybe it's a different story. But this is where I want to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's already been an impact on your endorsement portfolio.
Did you calculate that as well?
</P>
<P>
   A: To tell you the truth, it had no bearing whatsoever. The last
two years, I've been going out there to third base, and I'd look
into the stands, and when I'd see a Chipper Jones sign and it was
just like you'd pour 10 more pounds of guilt on top of me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did that contribute at all to your trouble with migraine
headaches?
</P>
<P>
   A: I had 'em every day. There were some periods when it didn't
affect me, but a few years ago, I got them June, July, August. I
don't think my headaches affected my play. But I remember going to
Bobby (Cox) when we were in Philadelphia once last year and
apologizing for stinking up the place when things were just really
going bad at home. That's when it's so hard to concentrate on your
job. It's just not possible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What did you think the immediate public reaction to your and
Karin's story would be?
</P>
<P>
   A: I didn't know. Well, I did know and I didn't know. I didn't
really realize where I stood as far as news in this town. I know
there have been some stories come out with athletes that wound up
with little headlines on the third page. To have this blown like it
did, I didn't expect that much reaction, hearing the calls over the
radio from people who are disgusted and disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has Karin's reaction been?
</P>
<P>
   A: The whole reason for us going through this now is that she
could handle it. But it has been difficult for her. I've seen how
people stare at her when we've gone out somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you relate your story with the current sexual
accountability issue? This has almost become a national epidemic,
from professional sports all the way to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think when certain people are given certain powers, whether
they are athletes or whatever, they can get caught up in the
importance. When certain things are offered them, in a moment of
weakness, they act upon it. It seems like it's happened a lot with
professional athletes, but it's not just us. It's happened with a
lot of other people in other walks of life, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How spiritual a person are you, and has that changed through
this ordeal?
</P>
<P>
   A: I haven't been much of a spiritual person. I wasn't raised
that way. I go to church on Sunday maybe two or three times a year.
I'll go through a period where I'll read the Bible and be very
interested in it, and then something else will come up, and I'll
forget about it. That sounds terrible to say, but I think last
Sunday was the first time in six years that I suggested we go to
church.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Other than the obvious, is there a lesson of some sort in all
this?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'll just say this. To look back on the day I told Karin, to
think I could inflict such pain on someone without putting my hands
on them, that humbled me. That really humbled me. To see the hurt
on her face, it almost seemed like it was premeditated. Our
relationship has come a long way in the year and a half to where
our marriage has been as strong as it's been. To do the things I
did in the past, it's really unfathomable. I wasn't a very good
person. I wasn't a very good husband. It just took some growing up
to realize how much she means to me.

 &HT;    Chipper Jones, wife discuss decision to reveal truth
 &HT;    (With BBO-CHIPPERQA)
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Chipper Jones returned home late Sunday night to find
a long list of telephone messages and a town strangely silent. Away
four days for the opening of deer season, the Braves third baseman
had left Atlanta with the town agape, fully expecting his city
would view him differently when he returned home.
</P>
<P>
   Extramarital affairs will do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``My public appearances will probably be cut way down, until I
feel a bit more comfortable with how people respond,'' Jones said.
``I'm going to be a bit more reclusive. I don't really know how
people are going to react or how they'll accept me. I will say in
the last four or five days, the few strangers that have come up
have been very receptive about Karin and (me) working this out and
sympathetic about the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Jones and wife Karin reiterated Monday that they have said
all that they plan to say about his confession to having
extramarital affairs and fathering an illegitimate child. But Jones
agreed to discuss some of the details about the couple's decision
to go public with the information and the impact it had on their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really realize where I stood, as far as news in this
town,'' he said. ``I know there have been some stories come out
with athletes that wound up with little headlines on the third
page. To have this blown out like it did -- I didn't expect that
much reaction, hearing the calls over the radio from people who are
disgusted and disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he left on Thursday morning, Jones had time to sample
public opinion; the story took on a life of its own on the airwaves
after it was published. Atlantans were stunned, and as Jones'
popularity rating tumbled, some of his commercial endorsement
accounts were under scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   A metro-Atlanta car dealership already has dropped Jones from an
endorsement, and Wendy's and Coca-Cola were facing decisions on
whether to keep him on board.
</P>
<P>
   But that seems a price the couple was willing to pay for making
a clean start.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two years,'' he said, ``I've been going out there to
third base, and I'd look into the stands. When I'd see a Chipper
Jones sign, it was just like you'd pour 10 more pounds of guilt on
top of me.''

 &HT;    Ambassador: Nothing to fear in Germany's transformation today
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month, the German people voted for change. Starting today
when Gerhard Schroeder is installed as the nation's chancellor,
they get their wish.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder will head what has been dubbed the Red-Green
coalition, a pairing of his own traditionally left-leaning Social
Democrats and the ecology-minded Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   For Germany, the shift comes after 16 years of conservative-led
government headed by Helmut Kohl. That's double the Reagan era in
the United States and more than four years longer than Margaret
Thatcher's run in Britain. Only once in history has a U.S. chief
executive come close to such longevity _ the presidency of Franklin
Roosevelt _ and Roosevelt was succeeded by a member of his own
party.
</P>
<P>
   From a distance, the change coming to Germany sounds jarring.
Some business leaders, in particular, are alarmed by the new
coalition's emphasis on bolstering social welfare _ including
restoring cuts in sick pay and pension benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition's tax reform program aims at cutting taxes for
lower and middle income people, rather than giving breaks to
corporations. And business is worried, too, by the Green-inspired
plans to phase out nuclear power and boost energy taxes, both to
encourage conservation and to generate funds for social security.
</P>
<P>
   This is not just news that affects Germany. Not only is it to a
large degree the economic engine of Europe, Germany also assumes
presidency of the European Union in January, just as 11 nations
begin merging their currencies. It also takes over the rotating
chairmanship of the Group of Seven major industrial democracies.
</P>
<P>
   Should the United States be concerned?
</P>
<P>
   Not at all, according to Juergen Chrobog, Germany's ambassador
to the United States. ``I think Americans should follow the events
in Germany without prejudices,'' he said last week during a visit
to Atlanta to speak at the Europe Seminar sponsored by the Southern
Center for International Studies. ``There are some people who fear
that `Red-Green' is something that reminds of old times in East
Germany or something like that, which is nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Chrobog spoke with due reverence for Kohl, ``a great politician,
one of the great European and world politicians perhaps.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also praised Schroeder, whom he has met twice: ``He is a
very charming man, very open, very relaxed and also a good
communicator. And what is very important, he listens. He listens to
advice. He wants to get information.''
</P>
<P>
   As the ambassador sees it, the key change coming to Germany this
week is not so much an ideological change _ despite the fact that
13 of the 15 E.U. countries are now headed by left-led governments
_ as a generational one. In that sense, it is much like changes
that already have taken place in the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war generation is replaced by the post-war generation,''
Chrobog said. ``Mr. Schroeder, the new chancellor, is a man
compared to President Clinton and Chancellor Blair, perhaps, Tony
Blair, because this is a very pragmatic generation, tackling the
issues as they come.''
</P>
<P>
   Chrobog sat in on a meeting between President Clinton and
Schroeder this month and thought the chemistry between the two was
``excellent.'' As Schroeder has done, the ambassador also stressed
that the new administration plans no change in Germany's foreign
policy, despite the presence of pacifist elements in the coalition.
That stance has already been backed up by the new government's
support for the NATO position on Kosovo, the embattled Serbian
province.
</P>
<P>
   And, while Schroeder is today's agent of change, one of his
missions will be to solidify changes already well underway in
Germany, all begun by Kohl himself. Kohl reunified Germany, and the
success of Schroeder's administration may largely depend on how
well he continues that integration.
</P>
<P>
   A major symbol of the new unity will be the shift next year of
the nation's capital from Bonn in the west to the old capital,
Berlin, in the east.
</P>
<P>
   Even more importantly, Kohl also was perhaps the key architect
of the new increasingly unified Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe is very much in the front of our agenda,'' Chrobog
said.
</P>
<P>
   The coming of the single currency next year makes closer
integration of European affairs ``absolutely irreversible,'' he
added, and Schroeder's government will continue along a process
that has reached ``the point of no return everywhere.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft attorneys Monday released an Internet
posting in which
</P>
<P>
   Netscape Communications Corp. engineers branded the company's
Internet browser ``faster than a dog with no legs. If the dog's up
to his waist in treacle. And dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The release in court of the faithless company posting served as
a shocking finale to four days of grilling on the witness stand by
Microsoft lawyer John Warden of Barksdale, the laconic
Mississippi-born president and chief executive officer of Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Warden was able to strike several telling blows as he sought to
portray Netscape as a troubled firm that followed a moral double
standard in the tumultuous browser wars. In sum, he contended that
Netscape was a sore loser that had been bested by Microsoft's
superior technology and customer-first approach.
</P>
<P>
   But as the historic antitrust trial entered its second week,
Warden remained unable to refute Netscape's central charge that
Microsoft had sought to use its monopoly powers in 1995 to divide
the soon-to-boom browser market in ways that would keep Netscape
from ever offering its own Windows product to computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale, characterizing the engineers' browser criticism as an
``electronic water cooler'' protest, told Warden, ``You didn't get
that off our Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we got as part of (legal) discovery from your counsel,''
Warden shot back, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   The headline on the August 1996 Netscape ``special report'' said
the company was getting set to ``release two or three more
bug-ridden betas and maybe an actual release version of something
which was obsolete months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we'll give you some vapourware announcements and
outright lies,'' the subhead added. In software patois,
``vapourware'' means products that have been announced but that
still don't exist.
</P>
<P>
   Warden also sought to show that America Online Inc. had chosen
Microsoft's Internet Explorer over Netscape's Navigator because it
was more technically compatible and because could be set up for
AOL's online service, the nation's largest, with more than 13
million users.
</P>
<P>
   In his direct testimony, Barksdale charged that the software
giant had given AOL an offer so sweet that it couldn't be refused:
an ``exclusionary agreement with Microsoft that prohibited AOL from
distributing the Netscape browser in any meaningful numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We offered to do whatever it took to get their business,
whether it was componentized or peanut butter,'' said Barksdale on
the witness stand, referring to AOL's desire to embed the browser
code in its on-line software.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kirsten Albrecht and Alexis Oberdorfer are both 27-year-olds
born of one black parent and one white parent, and adopted, as
infants, by white parents.
</P>
<P>
   But in their strongly opposing views, they almost embody the
whole debate over transracial adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albrecht, who heads the Transracial Adoption Group, a Los
Angeles advocacy group with a roster of about 10,000 transracially
adopted adults, sees cross-race adoptions as a way to help black
children whose parents cannot raise them move into middle-class
American society, and, by creating interracial families, to help
that society become more accepting of diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real aspect of transracial adoption being the most
successful affirmative action program of the 1970s, putting a large
number of black and biracial children into middle class families in
suburban settings,'' Ms. Albrecht said. ``I don't see it as a
second-best alternative, but as an inherently good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oberdorfer, a child-protection worker in Minneapolis, sees
those same adoptions as inherently difficult.
</P>
<P>
   She vividly recalls her childhood discomfort of feeling
different from her classmates, fantasizing about having long blond
hair, asking her mother when she would turn white _ and a painful
period in college when rumors spread that she was racist against
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have faces that reflected who I was,'' Ms. Oberdorfer
said. ``I remember how I would slump down, embarrassed when they
would talk about Africa or slavery in high school, and I could feel
everyone looking at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I was in denial a lot. When people asked how if felt to be
black, I would say I'm as much white as black, why are you focusing
on the black.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oberdorfer has two white siblings who are her parents'
biological children and a half-black, half-Vietnamese brother,
found abandoned and starving in Vietnam, who was adopted at age 3
and had serious behavioral problems as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oberdorfer, who remains close to her parents and believes
they did their best in rearing her, rethought her racial identity
when she went to Tanzania in her sophomore year of college.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a turning point for me, the first time I felt part of
something,'' she said. ``I felt welcomed to the motherland. And
that experience of feeling welcomed, feeling part of something is
one I have only when I travel, whether it's in Africa or in Cuba.
Here, the whites don't consider me white, and the blacks often
don't consider me black.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Ms. Oberdorfer reached a more wrenching turning point,
one so significant in adoption circles that it became the basis for
a training exercise in a North American Council on Adoptable
Children curriculum for those considering transracial adoption.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my grandfather died, the inheritance he left to my
brother and me was only half of what he left to our two white
siblings,'' Ms. Oberdorfer said, her voice beginning to waver and
her eyes filling. ``This is hard for me to talk about. My
grandparents never wanted me to be adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Oberdorfer's family ultimately equalized the
inheritance payments, the hurt remains, as do Ms. Oberdorfer's
conflicting feelings about transracial placement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When parents think about transracial adoption,'' she said,
``they need to think about whether their child will have role
models, peers in school or church, and whether they're willing to
take active steps to make their environment one that will be
comfortable for that child.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albrecht's group estimates that 175,000 black or biracial
children have been adopted in the United States by white parents
since 1968, but that there were fewer than 1,000 such adoptions
nationwide last year. But the only real certainty is that the
numbers have waxed and waned sharply in response to changing
attitudes and laws.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Child Welfare League of America's 1994 survey
of 22 state agencies, about 4 percent of domestic adoptions are
transracial. But a 1991 study by the Council on Adoptable Children
found that among private agencies that depend on fees from adopting
families, half of the African-American infants and two-thirds of
the Hispanic infants were placed in white homes.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies that specialize in placing black children have a far
more consistent record of finding African-American homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot depends on the agency's attitudes,'' said Toni
Oliver, founder and executive director of Roots, an Atlanta agency
that places children in foster care. ``I get calls from people
saying they can't find an African-American family for an
African-American child, because there aren't any in their state. I
say, `Oh, really, then where did that child come from?' And then
it's clear that they don't think of the community the child came
from as a source of worthwhile families.''
</P>
<P>
   Several studies over the last two decades have found that most
children adopted across racial lines do well in life, in both
professional achievement and personal satisfaction, and remain
close to their families. But while most studies find no significant
difference between the overall well-being of those adopted
transracially and those adopted into families of the same race,
some studies have picked up subtler indications that transracial
adoptees are more conflicted about racial identity.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albrecht, adopted by two white divinity students active in
the civil rights movement, said she had not felt that conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was really positive that my parents hadn't gone
through the painful personal racial experiences that you go through
in this country,'' she said. ``They taught me that I could do and
be anything, because coming from white middle-class families, that
was their perception. And I think it was better than making me
feel, as some black parents do, that I'd always have to work harder
in a racist world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albrecht said that she did experience racism, ``but I came
home to a family that was in tune with being able to talk about
those things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always a little impatient when a prep-school educated,
law-school educated transracial adoptee working in one of the top
law firms says it was so terrible that he never learned to deal
with racism,'' Ms. Albrecht said. ``I think it's an advantage that
he learned to function in the world of power.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A 28-year-old Jewish security guard was shot to
death by two Palestinian gunmen Monday afternoon, his bloody body
hurled from a speeding car and left by the roadside in the
rancorously divided West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in what seemed to be a gruesome tit-for-tat, a 69-year-old
Palestinian man was found slain in his olive grove outside the
Jewish settlement of Itamar, near Nablus, and anonymous callers to
the Israeli police asserted that it was a revenge killing on behalf
of the settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Among Israelis and Palestinians alike, the killings were linked
to the peace agreement signed at the White House on Friday. What
some saw as the inevitable spasms of violence that would dog the
peace effort, others decried as evidence that there was no genuine
good will.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, right-wing critics who welcomed Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu back from Washington with threats of ouster saw
the Hebron killing as proof that Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader, could not or would not control terrorism, no matter what
had been promised at the Wye Plantation in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``To believe the Palestinians would fight terror is to deceive
the people,'' said Moshe Peled, a member of Tsomet, a faction of
Netanyahu's Likud Party. ``And down that path of deception walk
Bibi Netanyahu and his ministers.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the West Bank, in a mirror image of the issue, skeptical
Palestinians asserted that the olive-grove killing proved that
Netanyahu does not want to control the settlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the news the Jews say that they are not satisfied,'' said
Mayor Mohammed Abu Samra of the West Bank town of Beit Furik, near
Itamar. ``We feel we are not secure as people who are surrounded by
settlers who will attack an old man picking olives.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu handily survived an attempted vote of no confidence
called by the far-right party Moledet on Monday, with not even half
of Parliament taking part. But a coalition of leftist and rightist
Israeli lawmakers agreed to send a direct elections bill to
Parliament this week in the first step toward dissolving his
government, and proposed that elections be held in March.
</P>
<P>
   In the marble halls of Parliament on Monday night, emotions ran
high and rhetoric flew, linking the Hebron killing to the larger
issues before them: the peace agreement and the fate of the
government. News of the second killing had not yet arrived there.
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Katzav, the deputy prime minister, said he was profoundly
depressed. ``For us, what is important is not a signed agreement
but the security of our people,'' he said. ``An incident like this
at such a moment _ it says that we in this agreement have made
large compromises and received nothing in return.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli security guard, Danny Vargas, was a Chilean-born
Jewish immigrant, a father of two and a martial-arts expert who
lived in a settlement on the outskirts of Hebron. He guarded a
power plant that served the Jewish settlers, and he was popular as
the town soccer coach.
</P>
<P>
   He was found nose down in a pool of blood about 2:30 p.m. by a
group of Palestinian photographers who saw the assailants flee into
Palestinian-controlled Hebron in Vargas' car.
</P>
<P>
   The photographers called both Palestinian and Israeli
ambulances; Palestinian medics arrived first. In an unusual scene,
the Palestinians worked furiously to resuscitate the settler,
surrounded by a crowd of Israeli police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the suspects fled into Palestinian-controlled Hebron, it
immediately put to the test one of the most delicate issues
negotiated in Maryland: the security cooperation between Israeli
and Palestinian forces. There has been a fragile working
relationship between the two sides in Hebron since it was divided
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking next to a weathered hearse that contained Vargas' body,
Brig. Gen. Yithak Eitan, the commander of the West Bank for the
Israeli army, suggested that there was some immediate cooperation
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We demanded Palestinian police to search for the car and the
people, and minutes afterward they found the car in the Palestinian
part of Hebron,'' he said. ``In some cases, the Palestinian police
do enough and in others they do not. I hope that this is one where
they will do everything in their power to apprehend those
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   An angry crowd gathered nearby, Palestinian youths juggling
rocks on the Palestinian side, and Jewish settlers spewing fury on
the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the response of Arabs to the treason agreement,''
Yaron Adler, 23, said, with a baby on his back. ``For 10 days Bibi
sat with him, with Arafat, and hugged with him like Chamberlain
hugged with the Nazi Hitler. May his name be erased.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlers' leadership first learned of the Hebron killing
when they were meeting with Netanyahu in Jerusalem, a day after
they withdrew their support for him and threatened to help topple
his government.
</P>
<P>
   After they learned of the second killing, they issued a beeper
alert to the news media, saying they hoped the killing would not be
traced to their community.
</P>
<P>
   ``If in fact our worst fears come true, we would like to
denounce the act of killing,'' said Aharon Domb, the settlers'
leader. ``This is not the way of the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Zalmout, who was 69 and the father of three, was hours
late in going home from picking olives, when his family heard radio
reports that a caller to the police had boasted of a revenge
killing. They worried, said Abu Samra, the mayor of the town where
they live, and with reason.
</P>
<P>
   After a long search prompted by the call, the Israelis found the
body near the settlement of Itamar, and it turned out to be
Zalmout's.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis closed the borders to Hebron and imposed a curfew
on the Palestinians who live there. A few days after a peace
agreement stressing reciprocal security was signed, an adviser to
Arafat suggested they take the same action in the settlement near
the olive grove.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't they put closure on Itamar like they have on
Hebron?'' Ahmed Tibi said.

 &HT;    AT MICROSOFT TRIAL, NETSCAPE IS ATTACKED FROM WITHIN
 &HT;    Eds: Corrects ``Internet'' to ``internal'' in lede.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft attorneys Monday released an internal
posting in which
</P>
<P>
   Netscape Communications Corp. engineers branded the company's
Internet browser ``faster than a dog with no legs. If the dog's up
to his waist in treacle. And dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The release in court of the faithless company posting served as
a shocking finale to four days of grilling on the witness stand by
Microsoft lawyer John Warden of Barksdale, the laconic
Mississippi-born president and chief executive officer of Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Warden was able to strike several telling blows as he sought to
portray Netscape as a troubled firm that followed a moral double
standard in the tumultuous browser wars. In sum, he contended that
Netscape was a sore loser that had been bested by Microsoft's
superior technology and customer-first approach.
</P>
<P>
   But as the historic antitrust trial entered its second week,
Warden remained unable to refute Netscape's central charge that
Microsoft had sought to use its monopoly powers in 1995 to divide
the soon-to-boom browser market in ways that would keep Netscape
from ever offering its own Windows product to computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale, characterizing the engineers' browser criticism as an
``electronic water cooler'' protest, told Warden, ``You didn't get
that off our Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we got as part of (legal) discovery from your counsel,''
Warden shot back, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   The headline on the August 1996 Netscape ``special report'' said
the company was getting set to ``release two or three more
bug-ridden betas and maybe an actual release version of something
which was obsolete months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we'll give you some vapourware announcements and
outright lies,'' the subhead added. In software patois,
``vapourware'' means products that have been announced but that
still don't exist.
</P>
<P>
   Warden also sought to show that America Online Inc. had chosen
Microsoft's Internet Explorer over Netscape's Navigator because it
was more technically compatible and because could be set up for
AOL's online service, the nation's largest, with more than 13
million users.
</P>
<P>
   In his direct testimony, Barksdale charged that the software
giant had given AOL an offer so sweet that it couldn't be refused:
an ``exclusionary agreement with Microsoft that prohibited AOL from
distributing the Netscape browser in any meaningful numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We offered to do whatever it took to get their business,
whether it was componentized or peanut butter,'' said Barksdale on
the witness stand, referring to AOL's desire to embed the browser
code in its on-line software.

AS LAWYERS SEEK PINOCHET'S FREEDOM, OTHER EFFORTS SEEK
EXTRADITION  
(JT)

<P>
   PARIS _ As his lawyers in London tried to quash a Spanish arrest
warrant for Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator,
efforts began in Geneva and Paris to have him extradited.
</P>
<P>
   In London, where Pinochet has been under arrest in a clinic for
the last 10 days, a phalanx of British lawyers argued before the
High Court of Justice that the arrest order sent from Spain was
illegal because the general, 82, is not a Spanish citizen. They
also maintained that as a former head of state, the general had
diplomatic immunity for actions taken while in office.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Clive Nicholls, said that if a bid to extradite the
general succeeded, by the same token Queen Elizabeth II could be
extradited to Argentina to face trial for the death of Argentine
soldiers in the Falklands war in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposing side, Alun Jones, a British government lawyer
acting as prosecutor in the case, defended the Spanish warrant,
which led to the general's detention in London. The prosecutor
argued that the the right-wing general was responsible for killing
at least 4,000 people and had set out ``to destroy a national group
_ Chilean nationals who did not share his ideological values.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the arguments in a court crowded with Chilean
exiles in the public gallery, Lord Bingham, Britain's senior judge,
said the court was expected to decide the matter on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Chilean air force has sent an ambulance plane to Britain in
hope of the general's early release. But efforts to prevent that
gathered strength elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, a public prosecutor, Bernard Bertossa, said Monday
that he had issued a warrant for Pinochet's arrest in connection
with the kidnapping and presumed death of a Swiss-Chilean citizen
in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Bertossa said he had opened a judicial investigation in response
to a complaint by the widow of the victim, Alexei Jaccard, who was
25 when he was tortured in Chile and subsequently disappeared. The
prosecutor said he was asking the Swiss federal government to seek
Pinochet's extradition from Britain to face trial in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time in Paris Monday, the families of three French
citizens, of whom two disappeared and one was killed in Chile
during the 1973-90 dictatorship, filed suit in a French court. In
addition, a human rights group in Paris said Monday that it had
filed a suit with a Paris court on behalf of Anne Marie Pesle,
whose father, Etienne Pesle, disappeared in Chile in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   In Madrid, Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish investigating magistrate
who first obtained Pinochet's arrest in London, said he had
formally requested the governments of Switzerland and Luxemburg to
block bank accounts held by the general. Court officials in Madrid
said Garzon wanted any accounts blocked with a view to their
possible use later as compensation to relatives of victims.
</P>
<P>
   In London, British officials keep insisting that Pinochet's case
will be decided by the courts and not politically, yet the issue
has stirred intense political activity both in Britain and in
Chile. Supporters and opponents of the dictator have traveled to
the London clinic where he is being held.
</P>
<P>
   From Chile have come six right-wing senators, the deputy foreign
minister, aides and legal experts who file in and out of the
private clinic in central London. From Europe have come dozens of
longtime opponents of the general who were forced into exile after
his 1973 coup against the elected Socialist president, Salvador
Allende Gossens. The exiles, along with others, stand daily outside
the clinic holding up photographs of missing relatives and shouting
anti-Pinochet slogans. On occasion there have been shouting matches
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is ill, and in a few days he will be 83,'' Mariano
Fernandez, Chile's deputy foreign minister, said after visiting
Pinochet who had minor surgery for a back ailment. After his
surgery on Oct. 9, the general was arrested by Scotland Yard during
the night of Oct. 16. The diplomatic and judicial entanglements
that ensued now involve at least five governments.
</P>
<P>
   The political and legal imbroglio could end if Britain's home
secretary, Jack Straw, decides that the general should be released
on ``compassionate grounds'' because of his age and failing health.
Last week he said that in exercising his powers under the 1989
Extradition Act, he would consider whether the offenses are of a
``political character'' and he would take into account ``any
compassionate circumstances.''

GERMANY CONVENES LAST PARLIAMENT BEFORE MOVE BACK TO BERLIN
</HEADLINE>
   (ll) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN, Germany _ The themes of an elusive unity and a painful
history were dominant on Monday as Germany's newly elected
Parliament convened for its last inaugural session here.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting just months before the symbol-laden return to the
Reichstag in Berlin next year, and on the eve of its formal
election of Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder as the country's
seventh postwar chancellor on Tuesday, the 669-member chamber was
full of the introspection that accompanies a major historical
shift.
</P>
<P>
   In its initial act, Parliament for the first time elected as its
president a politician from the former East Germany, Wolfgang
Thierse, 55. Thierse, also a Social Democrat, immediately addressed
the linked issues of the return to Berlin as capital and Germany's
difficulties in turning unification into a real unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If internal unity is really to come about, it presupposes the
equality made possible only by an acknowledgment of differences,''
Thierse said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the main issue in Berlin would not be ``the
dangers of a new Prussian military centralism,'' but the fact that
the city would ``as a melting pot of German-German problems force
us, the Parliament, to face these difficulties directly.''
</P>
<P>
   While embraced by an overwhelming majority of Germans,
unification has been marked by a bitterness unimagined in 1990. Its
huge cost has weighed on people in the west without spawning much
gratitude in the east, where rampant unemployment and the arrival
of what some see as a heartless consumerism have caused unease.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, anger in the east was central to Schroeder's victory
over Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and the choice of Thierse reflected
the Social Democrats' debt to that part of the country. Active in
the pro-democracy movements that led to the fall of the Berlin wall
in 1989, Thierse worked as a literary researcher in the former
communist state.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke on Monday in the glass-walled Parliament chamber beside
the Rhine that, in its simple transparency, seemed to capture the
modesty of the postwar German democracy that took root in Bonn.
Above him hovered the national emblem of the eagle, but one so
plump as almost to resemble a dove _ a Prussian symbol rounded to a
Rhineland docility.
</P>
<P>
   Much discussion has focused here on whether the eagle should be
reshaped for the move to the Reichstag _ some have suggested a more
angular look _ but in the end it was decided that the bird would be
unchanged as it moved east to Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   This debate, like many in Germany, has underscored a faint
uneasiness about the return to Berlin. By drawing Germany's center
of gravity hundreds of miles to the east, and by placing the
capital in the city that is at once the symbol of long division and
of unification, some, like Thierse, hope that unity will advanced.
But fears of a new German nationalism also exist, and Thierse
alluded to these.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not Berlin that let Prussian militarism develop _ it
was the political and military elites,'' he said, adding, ``Today
it is our obligation to repel and restrain opponents of
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Those opponents were from both the left and the far right, he
said, and should be viewed with vigilance in order that their
threat be overcome. A vocal, if very marginal, neo-Nazi movement
has grown up in the former east, largely in protest at 20 percent
unemployment there.
</P>
<P>
   Thierse's themes were also taken up the other speaker on Monday,
Fred Gebhardt, a 70-year-old member of the Party of Democratic
Socialism, the successor party to the East German communists. He
addressed Parliament as its oldest member.
</P>
<P>
   ``One cannot get rid of history, even if some people express
this wish publicly,'' said Gebhardt, whose great-grandfather, a
Social Democrat, was shot by the Nazis. ``This wish is not worth
wishing, because we must bear the responsibility of giving an
example by our lives, one showing we have learned the lessons of
history.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that the formerly communist east boasted
``considerable social and cultural achievements'' and that if this
was not recognized, ``we will fail mentally in solving the question
of unification.'' His words were greeted by a stony silence among
the center and center-right parties, whose members did not applaud
the speech.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of the members of the new Parliament are new,
and a record 207 are women. The Social Democrats and the
environmentalist Greens hold a comfortable 21-seat majority, enough
to insure Schroeder's election on an agreed program that provides
for modest economic reforms aimed at stimulating job creation and
more sweeping social reforms, including a new immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl looked jovial as he sat at the back of the chamber. The man
who led Germany to unification was awarded the Grand Cross by
President Roman Herzog on Monday. He was the first chancellor to
receive the honor since Konrad Adenauer, who laid the foundations
of the postwar state.

U.S. SERVICEMAN GETS 5-YEAR KOREAN PRISON TERM FOR SCANNING A
BANKNOTE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN MAKEIG 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To test out his computer's new scanner, Houstonian Dale Huff
made a copy of a 10,000-won Korean banknote in his barracks room at
Kunsan Air Base near Pusan, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I wanted to see how well it would reproduce. I wanted
to see how accurate it was,'' Huff said. ``I tore it up and threw
it into the trash. I didn't try to use it or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in March, and now Huff, 24, a senior airman who
graduated in 1993 from Cy-Fair High School north of Houston and
enlisted hoping for an Air Force career, has been sentenced to a
five-year prison sentence for the Korean offense of counterfeiting.
</P>
<P>
   What evidently happened is that Huff's discarded copy of the
currency, worth about $7 in U.S. dollars, was found in a trash bin
along with other items containing his name. The Korean garbageman
found it and turned it over to the Korean National Police, who then
notified Air Force authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Since Huff's name had been found and his fingerprints were on
the copied currency, he was arrested and brought before a Korean
judge on Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked if I printed it,'' Huff said, ``and I said `I did.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Asking not to be identified, U.S. Air Force officials who
watched the trial, agreed that the Korean prosecutor argued Huff
had tried to damage the Korean economy by counterfeiting. Huff's
Korean attorney contended his American client obviously was not
counterfeiting or he would have used better paper and not thrown it
in the trash.
</P>
<P>
   Huff said it didn't matter that he never attempted to pass the
copy off as the real thing. That the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's
followers attended every court session and added the counterfeiting
case to their litany of protests outside Kunsan Air Base did seem
to matter a lot to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Huff said he sat through the Oct. 22 sentencing proceeding with
a Korean interpreter at his side. He said he was not being given a
word-by-word account of what was being said in court.
</P>
<P>
   But once the judge finished talking, the interpreter informed
Huff he had been sentenced five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it could have been worse,'' Huff said. ``The medium
sentence was life and the maximum sentence was death. I got the
minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   Convicted and sentenced, Huff was sent Friday to a military
holding facility to await the outcome of his initial appeal. If the
conviction is affirmed, he will stay there as his second appeal
wends its way through the Korean justice system.
</P>
<P>
   If his case again is affirmed in a few months, Huff said, he
will be kicked out of the Air Force _ likely with a ``general''
discharge instead of a bad conduct discharge _ and off he goes to
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear the conditions are pretty bad,'' he said. ``From what
I've heard, you're handcuffed in a cell with five other guys and
there's a hole in the floor for you to do your thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Exercise periods and showers are available to prisoners once a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Huff's mother, Deborah Benestante of Cypress, Texas,
and aunt, Camella Schard of Spring, Texas, have spent a week
calling Korea, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere looking for someone
to help.
</P>
<P>
   Were they to do the same thing with American currency, they
figure, the Secret Service or someone might get aggravated with
them, but no one would send them to prison if they did not pretend
the copy was real and try to use it as money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally an injustice,'' Benestante said.
</P>
<P>
   Schard added, ``We're not stopping at anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday they sent handwritten letters and e-mail messages to
President Clinton, U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and
numerous U.S. news outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Schard was mystified how copying a currency note and throwing it
away could be worth a five-year stint in a foreign prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be more to this story than we've seen,'' she
said. &QL;

   WITNESS-LENIENCY (Wichita, Kans.) _ Every day in courts across
the country, witnesses take the stand in exchange for favorable

Prosecutors call them essential. So it was a jolt to

ruled last summer that federal prosecutors could no longer use the
testimony of witnesses, possibly facing criminal charges, who had
been promised leniency. Promises of favorable treatment violated
the law prohibiting bribery. The decision, thought to be the first

 &HT;    Air quality a priority for Barnes
 &HT;    (WITH GA-BARNES-PROFILE AND GA-BARNES-RECORD)
 &HT;    By Charles Walston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Poor air quality in the metro Atlanta region is ``a
bullet heading straight for our heads,'' according to Roy Barnes,
the Democratic nominee for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Federal highway funds are already being withheld from the area
because of air pollution, and the problem is beginning to hamper
efforts to attract industry, Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, tackling air quality would be one of Barnes'
first initiatives if he is elected governor.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he would immediately introduce legislation to
authorize a regional transportation authority, and a similar agency
to oversee water and sewer treatment. After those frameworks were
established, he would personally negotiate with local governments
to encourage their participation.
</P>
<P>
   Complicated problems like pollution require technical solutions
and political finesse, Barnes said. ``You have to be able to sell
what you come up with.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he would appoint former Atlanta Mayor Maynard
Jackson and developer Joel Cowan to recommend ways to cut air
pollution. He foresees a rail line along the northern arc of I-285
as a necessary part of any such plan.
</P>
<P>
   Other top priorities in the first year of a Barnes
administration would be adjusting the funding formula for local
school systems so they could offer more after-school programs, as
well as alternative schools for disruptive students.
</P>
<P>
   The state juvenile justice system, which is being monitored by
the U.S. Department of Justice because of overcrowding and other
problems at detention facilities, must expand its efforts to reach
youth before they get into serious trouble, Barnes said. He wants
early intervention to identify troubled youth, and more
community-based programs as an alternative to detention.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes also has a plan to cut property taxes by exempting the
first $50,000 in value on an occupied home or family farm. He would
start the cut his first year in office, phasing it in over four to
seven years, depending on how fast Georgia's economy grows.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Barnes would have to get Legislative approval for all
of these initiatives. But given his many contacts in both chambers,
and the fact that a new governor begins with a full measure of
political capital, it is likely that he could pass most of them.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes might have a harder time in the Legislature with his
proposals for HMO reform, especially if Republicans gain control of
one or both chambers. The insurance industry and its powerful lobby
oppose Barnes' HMO ideas.
</P>
<P>
   With 22 years of experience in the House and Senate, Barnes said
he would not have to rely on anybody to tell him how the
legislative process works. ``I'm not saying I know it all, but I
have a pretty good feel for what goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Kahn, the former director of the state Democratic Party
and a former aide to Gov. Joe Frank Harris, is Barnes' chief
campaign consultant and could be a key figure in a Barnes
administration. Dianne Harnell-Cohen is another campaign aide who
could wind up in the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   For the honorary position of chief of staff, Barnes would likely
follow the lead of previous governors and name one of his major
political supporters, possibly real estate developer Kim King.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he would want to keep the heads of all state
departments in place through his first Legislative session as
governor. Until then, he said he could not speculate which
department heads he might want to replace.
</P>
<P>
   Although House Speaker Tom Murphy is supporting Barnes in the
election, Barnes said he and Murphy probably would disagree on some
issues if he becomes governor. The same goes for Atlanta Mayor Bill
Campbell, who backed one of Barnes' opponents in the Democratic
primary but is now behind the party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Campbell opposes the creation of a regional water
authority, which Barnes insists he will implement.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that disagreement, Barnes said he believes he would be
able to work with Campbell in a cooperative manner. ``I don't
believe you solve problems by driving a wedge...into discussions.''

 &HT;    Roy Barnes, candidate for Ga. governor, learned law in the
family store
 &HT;    (WITH GA-BARNES-POLITICS AND GA-BARNES-RECORD)
 &HT;    (WITH PHOTOS.)
 &HT;    By Charles Walston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Roy Barnes' roots are easy to trace.
</P>
<P>
   To find the place where the Democratic nominee for governor grew
up, head west out of Atlanta on Bankhead Highway, across the
Chattahoochee River into Cobb County.
</P>
<P>
   There, squeezed between the highway and the railroad tracks in
Barnes' hometown of Mableton, sits a store that has been in his
family for three generations.
</P>
<P>
   Today the store trades mostly in hardware, but when Barnes came
of age in the 1960s it sold general merchandise _ vegetables,
nails, work boots, shotguns. It is where Barnes learned about
business and dealing with customers, and where he developed an
interest in politics and the law.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the place he returned to after his biggest political
disappointment, a failed bid to become governor of Georgia in 1990.
He finished third in the Democratic primary, behind Zell Miller and
Andrew Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came down here and worked a day or two,'' said Ray Barnes,
the proprietor of the store today, and Roy's older brother. ``The
first thing you know it he's talking to people. They said, 'Roy,
we're still behind you.' It wasn't but a few days (before) he was
back up and going.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes wasted no time feeling sorry for himself. Instead, he
analyzed his defeat and almost immediately began planning another
run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   After serving 16 years in the state Senate before his first
gubernatorial race, Barnes returned to the Legislature in 1993 as a
member of the House. He methodically worked at expanding his
network of supporters around the state, forging alliances with
fellow House members and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   A return to politics
</P>
<P>
   The effort paid off this year when he cruised to victory in the
Democratic primary, winning almost 50 percent of the vote. Although
Secretary of State Lewis Massey had forced him into a runoff,
Massey abandoned his campaign and threw his support to Barnes in a
show of party unity.
</P>
<P>
   Now Barnes is in the political fight of his life, locked in a
tight race with Republican Guy Millner, a businessman who has never
held office but has run for statewide office twice in the last four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Millner entered the race with an advantage over Barnes in name
recognition among voters, and his personal wealth of $167 million
also gave him an edge in fund-raising. As of Oct. 19, Millner had
spent about $11.5 million of his own money on his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has countered Millner's wealth by raising $9.7 million
from about 9,000 contributors, the most people who have ever given
money to a candidate for governor. To accomplish that, he has kept
a dizzying schedule for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   While some political observers have been surprised by Barnes'
perserverance, those who know him well have not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the context of what is fair and honorable, he is
willing to do what it takes,'' said Julian Bond, a professor at the
University of Virginia and chairman of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People. Bond served in the state Senate
with Barnes in the 1970s, and the two remain friends..
</P>
<P>
   As focused as Barnes has been during this election, it might
seem that a career in politics was inevitable for him. In fact, he
said recently, he easily could have wound up working at the family
store with his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it hadn't been for a twist of fate, I'd be a retailer
today,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   A career choice
</P>
<P>
   There's a family legend about how Barnes decided to become an
attorney instead of a merchant, a story that ``has some truth to
it,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   One summer day when Barnes was a teenager, he helped unload a
boxcar of sweet feed for horses onto a truck. The air inside the
railroad car was sweltering, and sticky with the smell of the feed.
``There were bumblebees flying around the size of silver dollars,''
Barnes recalled.
</P>
<P>
   After loading the feed on the truck, Barnes was headed back to
the store when he passed a lawyer's office near the Marietta
square. He saw the lawyer's shingle hanging outside, and in an
adjacent window he saw an air conditioning unit. The thought
occured to him that some people didn't have to toil in the summer
heat to earn a living.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Barnes became interested in the law and politics more
gradually, from talking to people around the family store.
</P>
<P>
   He had started working there as soon as he was old enough. He
waited on customers and was put in charge of the produce stand; on
nice days, he would put a scale outside and sell fruit and
vegetables to people waiting for a Trailways bus from Mableton to
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was about 12, Barnes would sometimes get on that
bus and ride downtown, then walk from the Trailways station on
International Boulevard to the state Capitol. There, he would watch
the Legislature at work.
</P>
<P>
   Next door to the family store was a small Justice of the Peace
office. Barnes' father presided over Magistrate Court there, and on
election days the building served as a polling place. At other
times, people would congregate around the office to talk politics.
Sometimes on his lunch hour, Barnes walked across the railroad
tracks to the home of Harold Glore, who was a law clerk for a
Justice on the Georgia Supreme Court. Glore recongnized that the
young Barnes had an interest in the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had me reading law books by the time I was in high
school,'' Barnes said. ``He's the one who really pushed me to go to
college and law school.''
</P>
<P>
   Segregation and the GOP
</P>
<P>
   Ray Barnes remembers his brother as a good student who liked
sports but wasn't very athletic, and who never got into serious
trouble. ``I never even knew a law enforcement officer to call
Daddy and say this boy needs to slow down driving,'' said Ray.
Barnes arrived at the University of Georgia in 1966, a time when
campuses were roiling with protest and change. He went against the
grain, joining the Young Republicans and the Army Reserve Officers
Training Corps. To get to ROTC classes, he had to cross picket
lines.
</P>
<P>
   His flirtation with the GOP was a sort of rebellion against the
Georgia establishment, Barnes said. At the time, the segregationist
Lester Maddox, a Democrat, was governor, and Barnes saw the
Republican Party as a preferable alternative. But by the time he
finished his undergraduate studies three years later, he had
abandoned the Republican Party because he was uncomfortable with
President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   During his last year as an undergrad, Barnes met Marie Dobbs, a
girl from Marietta. Their first date, a formal dance, was arranged
by their roommates. After she graduated and he finished his first
year at UGA law school, they married and moved into a two-room
duplex on Mabry Street in Athens. The rent was $95, and they lived
on Marie's teaching salary of $325 a month.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing law school and serving four months on active
duty in the Army, Barnes took a job as a prosecutor in the Cobb
District Attorney's Office. In 1974, he ran for the Senate from
Mableton. Although he and Marie had a son who was just over 1 year
old, she was supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put my child in the car and went to every business on
Bankhead Highway,'' said Marie Barnes. ``I asked people to vote for
him and handed out his campaign literature.''
</P>
<P>
   A senate win
</P>
<P>
   Barnes won the election and arrived at the Senate in 1975, the
same year that Zell Miller became lieutenant governor. Barnes, 26
at the time, was the youngest legislator elected in Georgia since
Reconstruction. Within a few years Miller had appointed him to
chair the powerful Judiciary Committee, and in 1983 Gov. Joe Frank
Harris tapped Barnes as his floor leader in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, who sat near Barnes in the Senate, remembers him as a
``tremendously engaging personality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was funny,'' said Bond. ``He wasn't above commenting on the
proceedings, and he could almost reduce me to tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond and Barnes sometimes disagreed on issues, but they
respected each other's views, Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very curious person,'' said Bond. ``He represented
the people who put him in office, but he was aware that there were
other people.''
</P>
<P>
   While Barnes established himself in the Senate, he was also
building a private law practice in Marietta, which he started with
attorney Tom Browning.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the firm handled a lot of criminal cases because those
were the only ones they could get. Although Barnes' political
opponents over the years have sometimes criticized him for
representing criminal defendants, he said he believes it is
something all young attorneys should do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a duty to represent not just what is popular, but
what is unpopular,'' Barnes said. ``That's the way the system
works. That doesn't mean you're soft on crime, or approve of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes developed a reputation as a skilled trial lawyer, first
in criminal cases and later in the civil litigation that now
accounts for almost all his work. Even today, at age 50, he enjoys
trying a case, Browning said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times when guys get to be our age, they're starting
to make a transition,'' said Browning. ``Roy is one who has a
natural knack for performing well in court, while other people are
frightened to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Wit and timing
</P>
<P>
   One of Barnes' best weapons in court, or on the political trail,
has been his biting wit. Occasionally, though, he has had to
backtrack from a caustic remark. Marie Barnes refers to her
husband's propensity for ill-considered quips as ``the SA gene.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes uttered one of his most outrageous statements last year
in reference to Cobb Commission Chairman Bill Byrne, a Republican
with whom he has an ongoing political feud.
</P>
<P>
   A few years earlier, when Byrne supported a Cobb ordinance
condemning the ``gay lifestyle,'' some opponents of the measure had
pointed out that one of Byrne's daughters was gay. Another happened
to work in an adult entertainment club.
</P>
<P>
   When Byrne was mentioned last year as a possible candidate for
governor, Barnes said, ``I don't know who's going to run his
campaign _ his lesbian daughter or his stripper daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   After the comment was published in the Marietta Daily Journal,
Barnes apologized publicly, but Byrne was not in a forgiving mood.
Although Byrne declined to be interviewed for this article, an aide
relayed the message that ``he has no respect for the man,''
referring to Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, however, Barnes is well-regarded in legal circles. A
Cobb County prosecutor, who asked not to be identified because
Republicans control the county courthouse, said, ``I don't know
anybody in the office who has a beef with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Browning, who has worked in an office next to Barnes for more
than 20 years, said his partner has little time for anything other
than his family, the law and politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time he has spent in politics outside the office is time I
would have spent camping and hiking,'' said Browning, an avid
outdoorsman.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the family store, Ray Barnes isn't surprised that his
little brother developed a passion for politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never told me he was going to be governor one day,'' said
Ray Barnes. ``But I did have a schoolteacher come in one time
whosaid he told her that he might be governor.''

 &HT;    Barnes fights 'too liberal' tag
 &HT;    (WITH GA-BARNES-POLITICS AND GA-BARNES-PROFILE)
 &HT;    By Charles Walston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Since July, Republican Guy Millner has spent millions
of dollars on TV advertising that tries to portray Roy Barnes as
``too liberal for Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Millner has focused on a handful of the votes that Barnes cast
during his 22 years in the General Assembly to support his claim.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, the Democratic nominee for governor, estimates that he
has voted on 50,000 bills in the Legislature. He maintains that his
overall voting record places him squarely in the mainstream of
Georgia politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``To take one vote out of context without giving the full
history is intellectually dishonest,'' Barnes said. ``It's just a
lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Millner has concentrated his criticism of Barnes' record on law
and order issues. Among the Barnes votes Millner cites are a 1980
vote against a bill that would have denied bail to people appealing
convictions on certain drug crimes, and a 1981 bill that gave
judges the authority to make criminals eligible for early release
from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he voted against the no-appeal bond provision
because it was unconstitutional. Several years later, he voted in
favor of banning appeal bonds for criminals convicted of a variety
of felonies.
</P>
<P>
   As for the measure that allowed judges to designate criminals
for early release, Barnes said the measure was necesary to prevent
a federal takeover of the state prison system, which was
overcrowded at the time. Barnes also pointed out that many
Republicans, including U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell, who was in the
state Senate at the time, voted with him on that issue. Millner has
been unable to cite any example of a criminal actually getting out
of prison early because of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes points to a number of anti-crime measures that he
sponsored and supported, including a 1989 bill that would have
allowed a judge to impose the death penalty if jurors could not
reach a unanimous verdict for capital punishment. The bill passed
the General Assembly, but was vetoed by Gov. Joe Frank Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes was Harris' floor leader in the Senate, and he helped
push through a package of anti-DUI legislation in 1983 that set
stiffer fines and jail terms for DUI, mandated license suspensions
and curtailed the use of ``nolo contendre'' pleas.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes also was a member of the House Judiciary Committee that
helped draft the 1994 ``two strikes and you're out'' law, which set
tough sentences for seven violent crimes. On the first offense,
criminals get minimum sentences that cannot be paroled; repeat
offenders get life with no chance of parole. Barnes voted for the
measure in committee and on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes also sponsored a constitutional amendment in 1988 that
allowed counties to add a surcharge to criminal and traffic fines
and to earmark the money for construction of local jails.
</P>
<P>
   Millner's criticism has not been confined to crime issues. In
recent debates, he has blasted Barnes for his 1984 vote against
establishing a state holiday to honor Martin Luther King Jr., and a
1989 vote in the Senate against starting a state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes says he was wrong on the MLK holiday vote, and that he
regrets it more than any other vote he has cast. He acknowledges
that he once opposed the lottery, but points out that he was not
even in the Legislature when Gov. Zell Miller's constitutional
amendment to allow a lottery passed in 1991. When that measure went
before voters in 1992, Millner voted against it at the ballot box.
Barnes' 1989 lottery vote was cast before Gov. Zell Miller took
office and initiated his lottery-for-education initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' record on environmental issues has earned him the
endorsement of the Georgia Sierra Club. He sponsored the
Metropolitan River Protection Act, which passed in 1986, and voted
against a measure last year that would have weakened restrictions
against building within 100 feet of trout streams.

GOOD-TASTE VIDEO VEGGIES DRAW KIDS TO GOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - No offense to Billy Graham, but the next generation's
celebrated evangelist may be a manic cucumber who sings silly
songs.
</P>
<P>
   In VeggieTales videos, computer-animated Larry the Cucumber
leads a cast of crisper-drawer friends as they teach children about
forgiveness, thankfulness, truthfulness and God in a way that
captivates kids enamored of Disney and does not send parents
fleeing from the living room.
</P>
<P>
   The writers poke fun at popular culture, take artistic license -
OK, the children of Israel did not really get Slushees dropped on
their heads as they marched around Jericho - and always end with
``Remember kids, God made you special, and he loves you very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether learning to love your neighbor on a spaceship called the
USS Applepies or learning you can't buy a happy heart at
Stuff-Mart, these are no ordinary vegetables on an ordinary
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of VeggieTales, Chicago creators Phil Vischer and Mike
Nawrocki say simply, is to nudge the entire culture toward God.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're becoming brutal and less tolerant and more sarcastic as
a society,'' says Vischer, the voice of Bob the Tomato, Larry's
more serious companion and the one who makes sure the lesson gets
wrapped up before the half-hour videos end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solution, we believe, is to look back at what made people
good in the first place, the knowledge of a loving God. If we can
return that knowledge to popular culture, we think we can improve
people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Vischer and Nawrocki, both in their 30s and both with Gen X
sensibilities, believe that nudge has to come with a liberal dose
of goofiness and appeal to adults and children.
</P>
<P>
   As a story line verges on the edge of serious, Larry will pop
in, maybe in a cowboy hat singing ``Everybody's got a water
buffalo, where did they get them I don't know'' or perhaps in
pirate's garb singing ``We're the pirates who don't do anything. We
just stay home and lie around.''
</P>
<P>
   Vischer and company at Big Idea Productions also want everyone
to think about the spiritual side of life. That's why they declined
early offers to distribute VeggieTales, then only available in
Christian stores, to the general market if the references to God
were removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidently God wasn't funny enough for popular media,'' Vischer
says.
</P>
<P>
   Current religious children's videos were nothing to laugh out
loud about and lacked the production values children expect,
Vischer says. Big Idea Productions wanted to fill the gap between
Sunday morning church and Saturday morning cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   But don't call Big Idea Productions a Christian company. It's a
company with a Christian world view and with a long-term goal to be
a top children's entertainment company, in the same league as
Disney and Warner Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The VeggieTales-related products are an important part of that
mission, Vischer says. The products from T-shirts to ties to
stuffed veggies made by Gund point people to the videos. The videos
point people to God. And they give children an alternative to Power
Rangers or other violent toys.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, the number of VeggieTales' related products have
proliferated to more than 100, from T-shirts to wall clocks to
place settings to lunch boxes. More than 30 are designed by
Phoenix-based Revelations.
</P>
<P>
   With little advertising and no television exposure, VeggieTales
has creeped into the popular consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the 150,000 people across the country who showed
up to watch a VeggieTales video premiere at movie theaters this
August.
</P>
<P>
   Or the 800 people toting cameras and camcorders who showed up at
Christian Books &AMP; More in Mesa for a photo op with a giant Larry
and Bob in January.
</P>
<P>
   Or the college students who vegetable-napped Larry the Cucumber
from the Baptist Student Union at Arizona State University, then
sent photos and ransom notes.
</P>
<P>
   It's the week in May when the first VeggieTales video released
to the general market was the No. 2 seller on the national
Children's Video chart, behind ``ELMOPALOOZA!'' and ahead of Barney
and Rugrats.
</P>
<P>
   It's the week in June when VeggieTunes and VeggieTunes 2 held
the two top spots on Billboard's Top Kid Audio chart.
</P>
<P>
   It's VeggieTales videos representing 61 percent of total video
sales in the Christian market.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest measure of success, though, is the letters,
especially from the dads who start going to church again with their
children after getting hooked on VeggieTales.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, religion doesn't seem so dorky anymore,''
says Vischer, the father of three young children. ``It blows me
away that it could have this kind of effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Vischer, though, did suspect a bunch of singing, dancing
vegetables would change people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Since meeting at Bible college, Vischer and Nawrocki have had a
knack for silliness and a desire to share God's message, despite
failing chapel. There was an attendance requirement, they explain,
and chapel was at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The two members of the puppet team occasionally would sneak out
after curfew and terrorize the security guard with their puppets -
in a nice, warped, loving way.
</P>
<P>
   They eventually became freelance computer animators, and the
first video was produced on borrowed money in unheated Chicago
office space. Vischer, Nawrocki and the other three who did the
writing, animation and voices for the video also packed up and sent
out the first shipment of 500 videos just before Christmas 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Now, past the starving college student phase, VeggieTales' 10
titles have sold more than 5 million videos, with 4 million sold in
the past 18 months. Big Idea has 50 employees in well-heated
Chicago offices.
</P>
<P>
   At ASU's Baptist Student Union, VeggieTales' clips have been
used during Bible studies and college students have become big
fans, said Jan Lows, the associate director whose Larry the
Cucumber disappeared for three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to psychoanalyze too much but I think they like
the return to innocence,'' she said. ``It's encouraging and
reaffirming to their faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Four-year-old Mary Baumann of Tempe has another explanation as
she sits discussing favorite story lines with her sisters and
friends: ``Because the cucumber is silly,'' she whispers.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Baumann, a stay-at-home mom with five daughters, says
the children do pick up on the messages. There was a time at the
Baumann house when the girls were scared about sleeping in their
bedroom, similar to Junior Asparagus' experience in ``Where Is God
When I'm S-cared?``
</P>
<P>
   ``We would start singing, `God is bigger than the boogie man,'
'' says Jennifer, who admitted that as much as she appreciates the
videos' message, the opening theme song wears on her nerves after a
while.
</P>
<P>
   She'll only be hearing it more often. In October, Big Idea
announced its first television show, a VeggieTales Christmas
special on Pax TV in late December. Pax TV is expected to be picked
up by Valley cable channels in December. Also, two area Christian
bookstores plan to rent theaters for the release of the 11th
VeggieTales video, ``Silly Sing-Along 2,'' on Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Vischer says, there's a backlog of videos to be released into
the general market, new videos to create and serious talks about
more television and a real movie. &QL;

<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ Denouncing Palestinian security chiefs as
agents of the CIA, hundreds of youths marched through the streets
of Ramallah on Monday, protesting the killing of a teen-ager by the
Palestinian police on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The killing occurred when military intelligence officers fired
on demonstrators protesting a weapons search at the local
headquarters of Al Fatah, Yasser Arafat's movement.
</P>
<P>
   The incident underscored the problems Arafat could face while
carrying out the security provisions of the Israeli-Palestinian
agreement signed on Friday at the White House. Formerly a guerrilla
movement that was the core of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, Al Fatah is now the mainstream political party in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The rough search and deadly shooting have infuriated Fatah
members and exposed the failings of a police force made up of
former guerrillas and street leaders accustomed to the codes of an
underground organization.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Arafat's forces are to confiscate illegal
weapons and break up groups planning violence against Israel. The
security efforts are supposed to be closely monitored and validated
by the American CIA.
</P>
<P>
   But the nascent crackdown is already causing a backlash among
Palestinians, including those in Arafat's own camp, who accuse
their security forces of brutality in the service of Israel and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   As they marched Monday, Fatah youths denounced Musa Arafat, the
chief of military intelligence. ``Musa Arafat, you are a CIA
collaborator!'' they shouted. ``Musa, you coward, you are an
American agent!''
</P>
<P>
   Stores were shuttered and streets emptied as the crowd surged
through the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   Marwan Barghouthi, the head of Al Fatah in the West Bank and a
member of the Palestinian legislative council, said Yasser Arafat
had signed a ``very bad security agreement'' that would meet with
public resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not let them confiscate our weapons,'' Barghouthi
said. ``We have to keep our guns during the interim agreement.
Fatah's weapons are ultimately the weapons of the Palestinian
Authority.''
</P>
<P>
   At a rally after the march, Barghouthi demanded that the
officers responsible for the fatal shooting be brought to justice
and executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is above the law!'' he thundered. ``We will not accept
violations!'' As he spoke, two masked youths carrying Israeli-made
Galil rifles appeared on a rooftop, but they were quickly ushered
away.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Awarta, a professor at Bir Zeit University who attended the
rally, said he was troubled by signs that the Palestinian Authority
was prepared to trample civil rights. In recent days the authority
has arrested critics of the accord after they denounced it in
televised remarks, and journalists were detained as they waited to
interview Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the leader of the militant Islamic
group Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are arrested without any warrants and without any
rules,'' Awarta said. ``I'm worried that Israel and America will
keep pushing the Palestinian Authority to fight opposition groups
without concern for human rights and democracy. We don't see any
condemnation from Israel or the Americans of undemocratic
practices. They only care about their interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of the CIA is very sensitive,'' he said.
``Palestinians see the CIA as another version of the Mossad,''
Israel's foreign intelligence agency. ``They don't trust the CIA to
do what is best for the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Israeli-Palestinian accord does, in fact, stipulate that
the Palestinian police must respect ``internationally accepted
norms of human rights and the rule of law'' and act to ``protect
the public, respect human dignity and avoid harassment.'' The CIA,
for its part, has helped train Palestinian security officers to
improve their professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Palestinian officials say, there will be no
campaign of repression against those who oppose the agreements with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Abdel Rahman, a senior aide to Arafat, insisted that the
Palestinian Authority would not muzzle dissent or curb the
social-welfare activities of Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a crackdown on Hamas,'' he said. ``It is only
against secret cells who are trying to have illegal weapons or
military training for operations in Israel. But Hamas is not
illegal.''

CANCELED TRIP ADDS TO DOUBTS ABOUT YELTSIN'S HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Three days after his spokesman insisted that he had
conquered bronchitis, enjoyed normal health and was wounded by
rumor-mongering to the contrary, President Boris Yeltsin called off
a one-day visit to Austria Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The same spokesman said Yeltsin, 67, now suffers from ``unstable
blood pressure and undue fatigue'' caused by his refusal to stop
working during his recovery from bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful that many who have tracked the decline of
Yeltsin's well-being since his re-election two years ago any longer
believe this. In Sweden, in Italy, in Russian cities like Novgorod
and Murmansk, and two weeks ago in Uzbekistan, where bronchitis
ostensibly rendered him unsteady and at times almost speechless,
Russia's president has seemed increasingly frail and out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow's newspapers and on television, a main topic of
conversation now has become not whether the president is seriously
ill, but with what, and how long he can continue in office.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the leader of free Russia is said to be replaying
a storied role from recent Soviet history _ the one in which Leonid
Brezhnev, his successor Yuri Andropov and his successor Konstantin
Chernenko were officially declared robust and in firm command even
as they slurred words and took to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Far from that, Yeltsin is up and about, mostly, and indicating
his determination to stay in power. Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, who will replace Yeltsin on the Vienna trip, said he had
talked to the president several times Monday and found him in
``very good working condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's spokesman, Dmitri Yakushkin, said on the television
news program ``Vremya'' Monday night that Yeltsin intends to meet
with journalists soon to discuss his health.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president does not need any defense,'' he said. ``He
himself speaks about his health whenever he thinks it's
necessary.'' Yeltsin, he said, takes talk about his health calmly
and regards much of it as political maneuvering by his foes. But
there are growing indications, capped by an unusual interview on
national television Monday night, that Yeltsin is in fact ceding
much of his role to Primakov and his aides.
</P>
<P>
   On the NTV television network, the deputy head of presidential
administration, Oleg Susuyev, suggested that Yeltsin now sees his
role as ``to help the government carry out its authority, but not
the way it used to be in the past, when all the enactments were
initialed at the president's administration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president today has to perform his duties as the guarantor
of the constitution _ to be the guarantor of Russia's integrity,
the guarantor that Russia is not closed to the outside world, the
guarantor of freedom of speech, freedom of press,'' he said. ``It's
his main function. Maybe this two-week vacation will help the
president to think about the newly formed situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Susuyev also indicated the administration is now open to at
least some changes in the Russian constitution, which Yeltsin
almost singlehandedly revised in 1993 to grant the presidency
extraordinary powers.
</P>
<P>
   While saying Yeltsin would not accept ``a light-weighted
approach to the constitutional amendments,'' Susuyev added that the
administration ``will take an active part in the process of
constitutional reform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do it thoughtfully so as not to do any harm here,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Such concessions may be needed if Yeltsin is to retain his
powers. Under the constitution, removing the president without his
consent is almost, if not quite, impossible. But Monday's abrupt
cancellation of an already truncated presidential visit _ to a
Russian-European Union summit meeting, no less _ is certain to add
to a growing roster of calls for Yeltsin to retire with dignity.
Yeltsin's decision to skip the summit meeting was announced first
Monday by the Austria Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin had planned to meet the current head of the union,
Chancellor Viktor Klima of Austria, on Tuesday to discuss issues
ranging from European investment in Russia to the Middle East and
Yugoslavia. But at midday Monday, the presidential spokesman,
Yakushkin, said Yeltsin had canceled his trip on the advice of a
``medical council'' of his regular doctors and would take a rest.
</P>
<P>
   Yakushkin said Yeltsin suffers from an ``asthenic condition,''
which in Russian means a general sort of weakness stemming from
almost anything, from bad nerves to the flu. In this case, he said,
the president had violated doctors' orders during his recovery from
bronchitis by not taking prescribed medicines and working instead
of resting.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin did make several visits to his Kremlin office against
doctors' orders, just as he ignored their pleas when he flew to
Uzbekistan early this month. His relapse Monday is nonetheless
especially striking because the Kremlin had declared him completely
recovered on Friday, and ready to fly to Austria as recently as
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to cancel the visit, which already was seen as a
barometer of Yeltsin's health, almost certainly was not taken
lightly. Yeltsin is widely believed to have wanted to make the
visit to demonstrate his grip on power in the wake of his shortened
visit to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of journalists who flew to Vienna was so big, and
the commotion around the visit was even higher because of hints at
the not-quite-healthy condition of the president,'' Susuyev said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the president felt that it would be the object of
special attention, as it was in Uzbekistan, and probably it was
that motive that played its role when he was making the decision
after the doctors issued another recommendation for him to cancel
that visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's seeming near-collapse in Uzbekistan two weeks ago was
by some accounts the most ominous in a long series of
health-related incidents, often on trips abroad. In Tashkent, the
president had to be supported upon arrival by President Islam
Karimov, nearly fell while saluting an honor guard and failed to
finish a toast at a state dinner, saying finally that he had
enjoyed visiting ``the facilities and stores.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Yeltsin curtailed a stop in Kazakhstan to return
home and rest.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, witnesses said Yeltsin was emotional and distant at
a naval ceremony in Murmansk and unable to climb stairs in
Novgorod. At the reburial of Czar Nicholas I in St. Petersburg in
August, he stumbled upon leaving the plane and sat through the
burial service, though protocol required all but the elderly and
frail to stand.
</P>
<P>
   In Sweden last December, Yeltsin stunned onlookers by announcing
he had decided unilaterally to cut the number of Russian nuclear
warheads by 30 percent _ a decision his aides quickly reversed. And
in Rome last February, he wrongly said that the U.N.
secretary-general was bound to Baghdad to defuse a crisis over
international inspections of Iraq's weapons capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's political authority has ebbed a bit with each gaffe.
As word of Monday's cancellation became public, emboldened
opponents went further and suggested that Yeltsin should be
required to undergo a physical examination by independent doctors
to determine his fitness to remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   On that, however, he seems to stand strong. ``There will be
another spiral of discussions of the president's health,'' Susuyev
conceded Monday night. ``We take it as a manifestation of freedom,
of democracy for which the president stands so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what ails Russia's president _ if in fact it is something
beyond pure post-bronchitis weakness _ is a matter of speculation
to all but insiders. But the mention in Monday's statement's of
blood-pressure instability raises a flag that Yeltsin may suffer
once again from heart trouble, since blood pressure is related to
the heart's ability to pump blood.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin underwent a quintuple heart bypass after his
re-election. Despite a long recovery that included a bout of
pneumonia, he was said then to be ensured several years of
trouble-free heart function.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he has been regularly plagued with illnesses, usually
called bronchitis or respiratory ailments, which have kept him away
from the office for long periods.

YELTSIN CANCELS AUSTRIA TRIP   AT DOCTORS' URGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a last-minute move bound to provoke new calls for
him to step down, President Boris N. Yeltsin on Monday canceled a
trip to Austria because of what aides described as exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   A senior adviser, Oleg Sysuyev, told Russian NTV television that
Kremlin doctors had urged the president to cancel the one-day trip,
which had been scheduled for Tuesday. He added that Yeltsin
probably would begin a two-week vacation Wednesday at his cottage
in Gorki 9, just south of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to cancel the trip is the latest development in
what is by now the longest-running drama in Russia. Most of the
country is convinced the 67-year-old president, who has an
extensive history of health problems and has already lived eight
years longer than the average Russian man, is fading fast and will
not serve to the end of his term in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Even recent political allies are calling on Yeltsin to step down
and allow early elections. An important addition to this group was
Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov, who campaigned for Yeltsin's reelection
in 1996 but now harbors presidential ambitions of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's loyal aides and few remaining allies insist that the
president will serve out his term. They say the latest series of
ailments, which began with what various Kremlin officials termed
``a cold'' and ``bronchitis'' two weeks ago, are normal for an
elderly man.
</P>
<P>
   But even the Kremlin acknowledges that Yeltsin has left the task
of the day-to-day governance to his recently appointed cabinet, led
by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is not so sick that he should be considered
unable to rule,'' Sysuyev told NTV. ``But the president will not
substitute for the government. ... I think the president should
from now on execute his duties as the guarantor of Russia's
constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, 68, will take Yeltsin's place on the Austria trip. He
leaves Moscow for a summit with European Union leaders at a time
when a delegation from the International Monetary Fund has arrived
in Russia for talks about when and if it will disburse the next
installment of a $17 billion rescue package.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, who had heart quintuple bypass surgery after being
reelected in 1996 and has spent much of his second term sequestered
in one of several residences outside of Moscow, has barely
addressed Russia's recent economic woes. Opponents have stepped up
calls for him to resign, saying the country needs an active leader.
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told Russian television that
a recent bout of bronchitis and general overwork had brought on
what he described as ``an asthenic condition, which is expressed by
unsteady arterial pressure and increased tiredness.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision to call off the Austria trip came exactly two
weeks since Yeltsin was forced to cut short his trip to Central
Asia, his first foreign trip in half a year, after almost
collapsing in public. That visit had been intended to silence calls
for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin disobeyed his doctors' orders to rest and quickly
returned to the Kremlin. At one televised meeting with Primakov, he
complained about the speculation over his health.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't even let me sneeze,'' he said.

MIDEAST VIOLENCE INTENSIFIES IN CONFLICT OVER LAND-FOR-PEACE DEAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Violence amid a new land-for-peace deal intensified
in the West Bank on Monday with apparent tit-for-tat killings of a
Jewish settler and a Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, fighting for his
political life in the wake of the agreement, easily survived a
no-confidence motion in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians shot and killed the settler while he was driving in
the West Bank city of Hebron, the Israeli army said, and the body
of the Palestinian was found a short time later just outside a
Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The killings were likely to raise tensions over the deal
Netanyahu made with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat last week. The
agreement provides that an additional 13 percent of the West Bank
will be controlled by Arafat's government in return for specific
Palestinian steps to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding like a candidate for the early national elections he is
trying to avoid, Netanyahu portrayed himself as a reluctant
peacemaker. He told his right-wing supporters that they would be
better off staying with his government than risking early elections
and a victory by the political opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever talks about elections has to take into account the
possibility that a left-wing government will come to power which
will dry out the settlement activity and cause its collapse,''
Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will take care of the settlements like we do,'' he
said. ``No settlement will be cut off. We also will ensure there is
a network of safety roads (connecting settlements to Israel
proper).''
</P>
<P>
   But few members the of pro-settlement faction in the Knesset,
Israel's Parliament, seemed convinced.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the ultranationalist Moledet party brought up a
no-confidence motion against Netanyahu's coalition. It was defeated
by a vote of 21-8 with 15 abstentions in the 120-seat chamber. Most
members stayed away from the vote because defeat was considered
likely.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition center-left Labor Party has indicated its support
for Netanyahu on the peace deal but has said it would work to bring
his government down on a unrelated issue.
</P>
<P>
   On the right, the National Religious Party, which severed
support for the prime minister on Sunday, worked with Labor members
of the Knesset Law Committee to draft a bill that would call new
elections in 100 days.
</P>
<P>
   The bill must pass three Knesset readings with 61 votes each
time. Its supporters said the 100-day time frame would give
Netanyahu's government time to implement the new peace agreement,
known as the ``Wye Memorandum`` after the Wye River conference
center in Maryland where it was negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   One member of Parliament, Hanan Porat of the National Religious
Party, said new elections could take place as early as mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   Some Knesset members expressed reservations about forcing
elections that they said could disrupt the three-month timetable
set out in the Wye agreement. But members of both the Labor and
National Religious parties portrayed Netanyahu's government as on
its last legs.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu responded by inviting National Religious Party
legislators to his office and asking them to stick with him after
the chamber votes on the Wye agreement, which most observers
predicted would easily pass with support from the Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu will present the Wye agreement formally sometime this
week. The vote will come after each of the 120 Knesset members has
had a chance to speak during the floor debate, which began Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Netanyahu's wooing of the right did not seem to bring
immediate gains. Outside the prime minister's office on Monday,
settlers paraded with placards saying, ``We Trusted You And You
Sold Us Out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank, the violence surrounding the accord mounted on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army identified the dead settler as Danny Vargas, a
29-year-old security guard at a power plant in the
Israeli-controlled part of Hebron. He was abducted by suspected
Palestinian gunmen while he was driving home to the nearby
settlement of Kiryat Arba, according to the army.. The gunmen shot
him in the head, threw him out of the car and drove off to the
Palestinian-held part of Hebron, settlers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ink of the agreement isn't yet dry and yet more Jewish
blood has been spilled,'' said Kiryat Arba's mayor, Tzvi Katzover.
``Netanyahu promised peace and security. There is no peace. There
is no security. Netanyahu should resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Settlers from Hebron and Kiryat Arba, a 6000-strong settlement
next door, responded by staging a demonstration Monday night,
during which they called on Netanyahu not to hand any more
territory to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unfortunately a classic example of what tens of
thousands of people are going to face if and when Netanyahu
implements this agreement he signed a few days ago,'' David Wilder,
a spokesman for the Hebron settlers, said about the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is peace,'' Wilder said. ``Peace is having people shot
and killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Hebron shooting, the body of the Palestinian
was found outside the Israeli settlement of Itamar, south of Nablus
on the West Bank, in what appeared to be a revenge attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palestinian police told us that it is the body of Mohammed
Suleiman Zalmut,'' said Mohammed Abu Samra, the mayor of Beit Furik
village where Zalmut lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We accuse the (Jewish) settlers of killing him,'' Abu Samra
said, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat faced his own battle with hard-line skeptics as he
struggled to put the steps he agreed to at the Wye center into
effect. On Monday, he angered his militant opposition by declaring
Hamas and Islamic Jihad illegal organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual founder of Hamas, responded
by calling the Wye agreement ``worthless'' and predicting that
Israel would not turn over any more territory to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank city of Ramallah, Palestinians demonstrated
against Sunday's killing of Wisam Tarifi, a 16-year-old from a
prominent Palestinian family, by Palestinian security forces. He
was slain during violent clashes sparked by a police raid to
confiscate illegal weapons from the local offices of Arafat's Fatah
Party, one of the actions delineated in the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, the policemen who killed Tarifi had been arrested.

GM REPLACES TOP MANAGERS AT OPEL, EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUSSELSHEIM, Germany _ General Motors Corp. replaced the top
management on Monday at its most important European subsidiary,
Adam Opel AG, but not before provoking a bitter rebellion by German
management and labor leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Just four months after GM installed Gary Cowger as Opel's
chairman, officials confirmed on Monday that they were transferring
Cowger back to Detroit to lead labor relations. He will be replaced
on Nov. 1 by Robert Hendry, who runs Saab AB, the Swedish car
maker, in which GM owns a controlling stake.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising game of musical chairs at one of GM's biggest
divisions came after the chairman of Opel's supervisory board
stunned executives here on Friday by resigning in protest over GM's
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The German press had for weeks been reporting rumors about
Cowger's transfer, further aggravating chronic tensions between
GM's American management in Detroit and Opel's more European
management in Germany. Those tensions stem in part from cultural
gaps but more importantly from strains over GM's effort to
streamline its engineering and development of ``world cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Once one of GM's most important sources of profits, Opel has
seen its earnings squeezed and its market share decline because of
ferocious competition among manufacturers of smaller cars. For the
first nine months of this year, the market share for GM Europe, of
which Opel is the core, declined to 10.5 percent, from 11.3 percent
in the period a year earlier. Including special items, GM Europe
has made $273 million in the first nine months, down from $440
million.
</P>
<P>
   The company lost ground as competitors like Volkswagen brought
out new models. Though the new version of its Astra sedan is
popular, Opel got off to a slow start this year because of early
production snags.
</P>
<P>
   Opel executives, including its former chairman, David Herman,
had been chafing for years for more freedom to focus exclusively on
the European market. But GM corporate executives have been pushing
in the other direction, trying to have Opel shoulder much of the
design and engineering work for all cars made outside North
America.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement was the culmination of what appears to
have been a trans-Atlantic power struggle during which resentment
within Opel reached the boiling point.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Burns, who became president of GM Europe nine weeks ago,
said the company had decided to recall Cowger because the company
needed him to rebuild labor relations in the United States after
the United Auto Workers' crippling strike in Flint, Mich., during
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that anybody expected a strike of the strength
and severity we had,'' Burns said at a news conference here on
Monday. ``Gary has proven that he can work with the UAW, and that's
important right now. We have commitments to the UAW, and Gary is
absolutely the best person.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowger will replace Gerald Knechtel, 57, who the company said
had elected to retire effective Feb. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But the news came as a slap in the face to many workers and many
managers here. They were even more unhappy about widespread reports
that GM planned to name Peter Hanenberger, the European product
development chief, as chairman. Hanenberger is a highly respected
engineer but has become extremely unpopular within Opel because of
his role in reorganizing the company to fit the new global game
plan.
</P>
<P>
   That resentment emerged in an unusually public way on Friday,
when Hans Wilhelm Gab, chairman of Opel's supervisory board,
announced his resignation to protest the management changes. Gab
adamantly opposed Cowger's recall and efforts to replace him with
Hanenberger.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was quite a lot of unrest over the future of the
plant,'' said Rudolf Muller, chairman of Opel's labor council and a
vice chairman of Opel's supervisory board.
</P>
<P>
   Though Muller refused to feud openly with corporate executives,
he pointedly praised Gab at length on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the vantage point of workers,'' he said, ``Hans Wilhelm
Gab has brought good fortune to Opel. He enjoyed the appreciation,
recognition and trust of the workers at plants everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of naming Hanenberger outright, GM disclosed a
rather awkward plan to install a two-man team led by Hendry, 54. A
longtime GM trouble-shooter, Hendry has been overseeing efforts to
turn around Saab in Sweden. But in a hint of GM's difficulties in
finding a replacement for Cowger, Hendry will remain in charge of
Saab while taking over responsibility for the much bigger Opel
operations as well.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said the company had taken that course because Saab had no
obvious successors to Hendry, and the Swedish auto maker is still
in a delicate phase of recovery. Meanwhile, in a departure from
past practices, GM named a new vice chairman of Opel, the longtime
German executive Wolfgang Strinz. It also named several new members
to the top management board, including Bo Andersson, a former Saab
executive who is head of purchasing for GM Europe.
</P>
<P>
   GM also announced several new members of Opel's supervisory
board, which oversees the management and was abruptly left without
a chairman when Gab resigned. The new chairman will be Hans Barth,
a German-born Opel executive who has worked in both technical and
financial jobs.

TEXAS PLAYERS NOT GOING OUT ON LIMB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _The last time the Texas Longhorns crossed paths with
Nebraska, a brash quarterback suggested pregame expectations were
out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that his team was a 21-point underdog heading into the
1996 Big 12 championship game, then-Texas quarterback James Brown
said: ``I think we'll win by three touchdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas won, 37-27.
</P>
<P>
   The teams meet at 2:30 p.m. Saturday in Lincoln, Neb. for the
first time since that day. Just as they did in 1996, the Longhorns
(5-2, 3-1) will carry a four-game winning streak into the contest.
They are unranked, just like in 1996, and once again enter as
double-digit underdogs (17 points) against a top-10 opponent
(Nebraska is No. 7, down four spots from its 1996 ranking).
</P>
<P>
   All that is lacking, from a Texas standpoint, is a bold
prediction of an impending upset to complete the list of the
pregame similarities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not James Brown,'' linebacker Anthony Hicks said. ``I
can't make predictions like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Major Applewhite, a redshirt freshman, smiled and
shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``No predictions,'' Applewhite said.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Derek Lewis, whose 61-yard catch on fourth-and-one
helped seal Texas' upset in 1996, came closest to following in
Brown's footsteps yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see people don't think we're quite as bad this time,'' Lewis
said, noting the 17-point spread. ``You know, sometimes the odds
aren't always right. This is our chance to show the world \Ra poor
start\S is behind us. Now, we're battle-tested and ready for a big
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, however, declined to predict the big win would happen
against Nebraska. Finally, Texas tailback Ricky Williams, who
carried a career-low eight times in the 1996 title game, stepped
out on a limb _ sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I predict I'll carry more than eight times this game,'' said
Williams, who averages 32.4 carries and 212 yards per game.

   WITNESS-LENIENCY (Wichita, Kans.) _ Every day in courts across

Prosecutors call them essential. So it was a jolt to
law-enforcement officials when a three-judge federal appeals court
ruled last summer that federal prosecutors could no longer use the
testimony of witnesses, possibly facing criminal charges, who had
been promised leniency. Promises of favorable treatment violated
the law prohibiting bribery. The decision, thought to be the first
successful challenge to the practice of offering witnesses
leniency, has triggered an unprecedented examination in the courts,
in Congress and among legal scholars. By William Glaberson.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Los Angeles Kings general manager Dave Taylor
acknowledged Monday &UR;  &LR; that he spoke to the New York Islanders about
acquiring restrictedfree-agent forward Ziggy Palffy, but not
recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had any talks with them at all lately,'' Taylor
saidfollowing the Kings' practice at the Nassau Coliseum, where
they play theIslanders tonight. ``We've had discussions, but
there's nothing there.''
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, 26, has averaged 45 goals the last three seasons. He
reportedlyis seeking an annual salary of $6 million, close to $1
million more thanis earned by the highest-paid King, defenseman Rob
Blake. The Islandersreportedly have pulled their three-year,
$12.75-million offer off thetable.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy has been skating in his native Slovakia during the
stalemate.Taylor also said he is not interested in trying to sign
Palffy to anoffer sheet. If the Kings did that, the Islanders could
match the offer,or they could choose not to match, in which case
the Kings would getPalffy in exchange for five first-round draft
choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'd want to go that route,'' said Taylor, whose
team hasstruggled offensively early this season.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset close: Kings coach Larry Robinson said Manny Legace
probably will start ingoal tonight, with Stephane Fiset very likely
to return from his groininjury in the finale of the five-game trip
against the New Jersey Devilson Wednesday. Winger Josh Green, who
has missed the last three games witha shoulder strain, is cleared
to play tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, center Ian Laperriere (partially torn anterior
cruciateligament in his left knee) has been fitted with a brace and
may try toskate this week and goalie Jamie Storr (groin strain)
also may try somelight skating this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are being very careful with center Jozef Stumpel
(hip-flexorstrain). They won't allow him to play until he is free
of pain. He didnot skate Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might as well keep him out until he's 100 percent,''
Robinson said.

RAID ON TEXAS TRIO PRODUCED DRUMS OF MARMALADE, JARS OF COCONUT
OIL, BUT NO DEADLY BIOTOXINS  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLMITO, Texas _ When squads of FBI agents, firefighters and
hazardous materials experts in safety suits raided the quiet
lakeside trailer home of Johnie Wise one blistering afternoon in
July, neighbors were stunned.
</P>
<P>
   They watched as chemical drums and jars of liquid were tagged
and carted off, and later heard authorities speculate that they
were the raw ingredients of a macabre plot to infect the nation's
leaders with deadly biotoxins.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the drums contained orange marmalade. The jars
held coconut oil for making soap.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Wise, a 72-year-old former sea captain, crop
duster and aloe vera farmer, and two of his friends are now on
trial in U.S. District Court in Brownsville, Texas. They are
charged with conspiring and threatening to use weapons of mass
destruction against President Clinton, Attorney General Janet Reno,
Texas Attorney General Dan Morales and the heads of most federal
police agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Wise, Jack Abbott Grebe Jr., 43, and Oliver Dean Emigh, 63, have
been jailed without bond since their arrests; if convicted, they
face a possible life sentence in prison. &UR;  &LR; With the trial now in its
second week, prosecutors expected to wrap up their end of the case
by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As the bizarre case unfolds, some say it smacks of a government
frame-up of three retirees with ties to the Republic of Texas
separatist movement who liked to drink and blow off steam about the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll hear a lot of discussion about wine-making in this
case,'' Wise's attorney, Keith Uhles, told the jury when the trial
began last week. ``They sat around and drank wine and talked big.
But talking big by itself is not a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors and some Rio Grande Valley residents feel
federal authorities had a duty to investigate the men, who were
part of a small group of anti &UR; - &LR; government sympathizers who met
twice a month at a truck stop north of Harlingen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI is just doing what we pay them to do,'' said one
Brownsville businessman.
</P>
<P>
   In the small community of Olmito, Wise is known as a
compassionate and slightly eccentric man who often hosts cookouts
in a small shack he erected next to a winding lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's into alternative medicine, health foods,'' said John
Noorda, a computer programer who lives across the lake from Wise's
trailer home. ``He's sort of a do-it-yourself man, get back to
nature, be able to survive. What if everything came crashing down,
you wouldn't know how to make soap. Well, Johnie Wise would know
how to make soap.''
</P>
<P>
   But Noorda and other friends insist that Wise, a man with an
eighth-grade education, would have no part in a plan to harm
innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be more inclined to believe the FBI fabricated all the
evidence before I'd believe that John Wise would become a party to
the actual crime of killing massive amounts of people, of infecting
people with diseases that spread,'' Noorda said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time jurors returned to court Monday for the second week
of trial, they had already viewed a 45-minute secret FBI videotape
of a June 26 meeting at a Harlingen residence where Wise and Grebe
watched as a third man, the FBI's informant, sent threatening
e-mail messages on his personal computer to Clinton and other
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The tape then shows the informant, John L. Cain, complimenting
Grebe and Wise on selecting only high-ranking federal officials as
the targets of their threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taught if you're going to fight, pick on the biggest
one,'' replies Grebe, a Republic of Texas member and a single
parent who supports himself and his daughters by working odd jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Cain then asks Wise how he is progressing on the assembly of a
delivery system for the biotoxins _ a Bic lighter converted to
shoot cactus thorns dipped in rabies, anthrax or blood containing
the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't done a thing,'' Wise replies. ``I'm just scattered
so thin.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents acknowledge they never found a weapon or any
biological toxins during their raid. But that's not the point.
Sending the threatening e-mail is a serious crime in itself.
</P>
<P>
   The question, according to the defense, is whether the three men
came up with the idea on their own or whether Cain, and therefore
the federal government, pushed them into it.
</P>
<P>
   This week, defense attorneys are trying to portray Cain, a
37-year-old Harlingen computer consultant, as the instigator of the
plot _ a wannabe cop and police informant with a patchy employment
history who acknowledged exaggerating his work experience.
</P>
<P>
   Cain began calling FBI agents last February after he and his
wife went shopping at a Harlingen second-hand shop, the Bargain
Barn. There, Cain had met shop owner John Roberts, who described
himself as a high-ranking member of the Republic of Texas, a group
that believes Texas was illegally annexed and is not part of the
United States. Cain said Roberts offered him work building a
computer database for the group.
</P>
<P>
   Cain told the jury last week that the FBI paid for his trip to
Conroe to accept an offer to become the Republic's ``undersecretary
for trade and commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI Agent David Church, who met with Cain four times in March
and April and later recruited him as a paid informant, said Cain
told him that Roberts wanted him to access a nationwide crime
database to determine if two Republic ``citizens'' had been
arrested on outstanding warrants. Cain also said other Republic
officials wanted him to hack into military databases.
</P>
<P>
   Church said he added Cain's information to an
intelligence-gathering investigation that the FBI's San Antonio
office is conducting on the Republic of Texas. He got approval to
begin a separate case on May 20 after Cain reported that Wise and
Grebe were pressuring him to help with the plan to threaten and
infect federal agents and their families with biotoxins.
</P>
<P>
   Cain told the jury that, acting on instructions from Wise and
Grebe, he sent by computer a ``Declaration of War'' Emigh had
written to the White House and other federal and state agencies on
June 12. A second round of threats was sent by Cain on June 26 at
the session caught on FBI cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Uhles, who is defending Wise, noted that the FBI has paid more
than $18,000 to Cain for his services and for reimbursement of lost
income and relocation expenses to ensure his safety awaiting trial.
Cain is continuing to receive a monthly $1,050 rent stipend from
the FBI. &QL;

RULING AGAINST TESTIMONY-FOR-LENIENCY JOLTS COURT SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Kan., N.M., Okla., Utah, Wyo., Texas, Md., Tenn.)  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA, Kan. _ Every day in courts across the country,
witnesses take the stand in exchange for favorable treatment from
prosecutors. Some people call them informers. Prosecutors call them
essential.
</P>
<P>
   So it was a jolt to law-enforcement officials across the country
when a three-judge federal appeals court ruled this summer that
federal prosecutors could no longer use the testimony of witnesses,
possibly facing criminal charges, who had been promised leniency.
Promises of favorable treatment, the court said, violated the
federal law prohibiting bribery.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which some lawyers say may be the first successful
challenge under the federal bribery law to the practice of offering
witnesses leniency, a centerpiece of the legal system since
Colonial times, has triggered an unprecedented national examination
in the courts, in Congress and among legal scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Since the ruling, which is now under review by the full federal
appeals court in Denver, courts in virtually every state have been
asked to bar leniency deals, bills have been introduced in Congress
to negate the effect of the panel's decision and legal scholars
have been debating whether prosecutors have grown too reliant on
the use of informers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the culture of this country, nobody likes a snitch, yet
that has become the crux of the criminal justice system,'' said
Steven Zeidman, a professor of criminal law at New York University
Law School. ``But nobody likes to think about it, and now we're
being forced to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal bribery law says that ``whoever'' offers ``anything
of value to any person'' for testimony commits a crime. In its July
1 ruling, the three-judge panel said that ``whoever'' includes
federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judicial process is tainted and justice cheapened when
factual testimony is purchased, whether with leniency or money,''
the panel said in a drug case that began here.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, the ruling was annulled by the full 12-member 10th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Denver, which decided it should
review a decision with such far-reaching consequences. The full
court is to hear the case next month.
</P>
<P>
   In its original ruling, the three-judge panel ordered a new
trial for the defendant, Sonya Singleton, a 25-year-old mother of
two children. At her trial in 1997 on charges of being involved in
a drug conspiracy and money-laundering, she was identified as part
of a drug distribution scheme by a Wichita cocaine dealer, who was
then given a reduced sentence in exchange for his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Until the full appeals court decided to review the case, the
ruling was binding on all the federal courts in the six states of
the 10th Circuit: Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   But because circuit courts are second in importance only to the
Supreme Court, the ruling was seen as damaging to prosecutors
nationally. In legal papers, the Justice Department said the
decision by the three-judge panel to ``make a criminal out of
nearly every federal prosecutor'' was an ``absurd result.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials here and in Washington, who are
working together on the appeal because of its national importance,
declined to be interviewed. But in their legal filings, they say
the panel's ruling could cripple prosecutors. During the short time
it was in effect, the ruling ``caused chaos in the District Courts
and U.S. attorney's offices in this circuit and significant
disruption throughout the rest of the country,'' the Justice
Department filing says.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers said, for example, that the ruling
paralyzed organized crime prosecutions because it was unclear
whether prosecutors could rely on the testimony of crucial
cooperating witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers said the ruling was far from absurd and exposed
a flaw in the American justice system that had been ignored too
long. In an interview here, Ms. Singleton's lawyer, John Wachtel,
said prosecutors everywhere had perverted the justice system by
offering leniency to criminals so they could win cases, even
against innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from a federal prison in Texas, Ms.
Singleton said it was unfair that prosecutors had a tool as potent
as freedom to offer witnesses. ``Who wouldn't testify against
somebody,'' she said, ``even if it's a lie, just so they can go
home?'' She says she is innocent; she is serving a four-year term
while she appeals her conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers has filed a
friend-of-the-court brief urging the court to support Ms.
Singleton's appeal. And defense lawyers from coast to coast said
that no topic had received more attention this fall than the
Singleton ruling. Although the Singleton case deals only with
federal prosecutors, defense lawyers have begun to file similar
challenges in many states that have bribery statutes with
provisions similar to the federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel said that if the full appeals court reversed the panel's
decision, he would ask the Supreme Court to review the case.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts say that whatever the merits of the argument
in the Singleton case, the panel's original ruling would tie the
legal system in knots because prosecutors use offers of leniency so
frequently.
</P>
<P>
   If the ruling is affirmed, said Roscoe Howard Jr., a professor
of criminal law at the University of Kansas School of Law, ``the
system would grind to a halt.'' Howard, a former federal
prosecutor, said that without leniency offers, defendants would
have no incentive to cooperate and prosecutors would be forced to
try every case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a government attorney can't make these sorts of deals,''
Howard said, ``physically I don't think our court system could
handle the number of trials that would come through.''

BARBARA BUSH SAYS RUMORS OF TEXAS GOV. BUSH'S `IRRESPONSIBLE YOUTH'
ARE `BALONEY' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
and ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS _ Former first lady Barbara Bush said Monday
that rumors about the ``irresponsible youth'' of her son, Gov.
George W. Bush, are blown out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is baloney,'' Mrs. Bush said at the dedication of a San
Antonio, Texas, elementary school named after her. ``He said one
time he was not perfect growing up. Maybe he wasn't. His mother and
father did not have a worry about him. That's just crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaigned in San Antonio and the Rio Grande Valley on
Monday while Democratic challenger Garry Mauro pitched his
education themes to an educators' group in Waco, Texas, and to a
sparse hometown crowd in Bryan, Texas, of about 40, a third of whom
by Mauro's estimate were his own relatives.
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday, the gubernatorial candidates reported their
campaign contributions for the last month. Mauro's indicated that
his San Antonio and Houston fund-raisers last month headlined by
President Clinton apparently raised far less than the $1 million
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro reported raising $511,932 since Sept. 24 and accepting
$225,000 in loans. The contributions include $125,000 from Houston
developer Andrew Schatte, $100,000 from former Texas Democratic
Party Chairman Billy Goldberg and $25,000 from Houston lawyer John
O'Quinn. The Clinton fund-raisers were on Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Bush raised $1.47 million in the same period, bringing his total
since July to $17.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's youth has come under renewed scrutiny lately amid
speculation that he will run for president in 2000 if he wins
re-election next week. Bush has admitted to drinking too much until
he was 40 and has declined to answer questions about drug use. He
has said only that he was ``irresponsible'' at times when young.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush scolded the governor Monday, saying, ``Never tell them
you're not perfect, George.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor told Newsweek magazine in its current issue that he
does not reveal details of his ``irresponsibility'' because he
wants to set an example for youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: Have you learned from your behavior? The
answer is yes. If I were you, I wouldn't tell your kids that you
smoked pot unless you want them to smoke pot. I don't want some kid
saying, `Well, Governor Bush tried it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bush said it is ``agony'' having Gov. Bush on the
re-election ballot in Texas next week at the same time another son,
Jeb, is running as the Republican nominee for governor in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be extraordinarily proud,'' Mrs. Bush said of the
potential dual victory. ``They have never let us down, always been
great sons.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he will not decide until next year on whether to make
a run. He said nothing in his past will disqualify him from the
presidency, but he said he is worried about the effect of a
campaign on his wife and daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been scrutinized in my life,'' Bush said. ``What people
know in Texas is that when I put my hand on the Bible to swear in,
I promise not only to uphold the laws of this state but the dignity
and honor of the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I said was I'm not sure I want to submit my family to the
meat grinder of Washington, D.C., life,'' Bush said. ``There's a
huge difference between being the first family of Texas and the
first family of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's wife, Laura, said she will decide whether she can face
the ``meat grinder'' at the appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll think about that when the time comes, if the time
comes,'' Laura Bush said. ``Right now, we'll think about the Texas
governor's race.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro began his day with an address to about 700 teachers at the
Central Texas League of Middle Schools annual conference in Waco,
where he graduated from high school and was introduced by a former
classmate.
</P>
<P>
   At each stop, he drove home his message on education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should borrow $2 billion, just like we borrowed $1 billion
to build prisons, we need to borrow $2 billion, divvy it out to
local school districts and finally build enough classrooms so that
we will have classroom space to enforce our class size law, stop
giving waivers on 22-to-1 (student-teacher ratio) and enforce that
law once and for all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also reiterated his pledge to give teachers an
across-the-board $6,000 raise to bring teacher salaries in Texas to
the national average. He criticized Bush for allowing Texas teacher
pay to drop from 36th to 38th nationwide. He said the $6,000 pay
increase will raise the state teacher pay schedule ranking to 25th
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush won't support teacher pay raises that will take us
to 25th,'' Mauro said. ``Think about it. His solution is, `Well I
don't want to make a tough decision. I want to give a little bit of
money to the local school districts and if they want to give
teachers a pay raise they'll get it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed giving $1.6 billion to local school districts
to use on salaries, facilities or hiring as they choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush is in hiding (because) he doesn't know how to make
tough decisions, he doesn't know how to make decisions that affect
ordinary Texans' life. He's just plain out of touch,'' Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the state cannot realistically begin to talk about
teacher incentives and other programs for teachers until some
basics are addressed first, such as bringing teachers retirement
benefits in line with other state employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of problem does this state have when my telephone
receptionist has better benefits than the people who spend the day
with my kids. Something's wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Bryan, Mauro drove by the Pizza Hut where he worked when he
was 18, making a dollar an hour and eating all the pizza he could
eat, bringing out the the distinction between his humble background
and Bush's privileged childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we know for certain: George Bush never worked a day
in his life. George Bush is the son of Barbara Bush and that's why
he's governor of Texas today,'' Mauro said. Bush worked in the oil
business in West Texas and was managing partner of the Texas
Rangers baseball team before winning election as governor.
</P>
<P>
   He also told the crowd of about 40 supporters that if elected
governor, he will be the first from Brazos County, the first Aggie,
the first Italian American and the first Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro ended the day at the Astrohall where Harris County
Constable Jack Abercia held his annual barbecue for Democratic
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaigned in McAllen and Laredo with other members of the
statewide Republican ticket. Bush, who received 24 percent of the
Hispanic vote in 1994, said his goal is to win 40 percent of the
Hispanic vote in this election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he has tried to earn Hispanic votes by being a good
neighbor to Mexico, refusing to bash immigrants and by believing
English and Spanish languages can co-exist in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes Republicans send a message that this is us, not
you,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he welcomes first lady Hillary Clinton's visit to El
Paso to campaign for Mauro. Bush noted that Vice President Al Gore
visited El Paso for Mauro in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Democrats are afraid Garry Mauro can't hold El
Paso,'' Bush said. ``They want to fight the fight there. That's
fine by me. I'll be glad to wage a battle for El Paso any time, any
where, any day.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro put the campaign in perspective for fourth and fifth
graders at Oak Hill elementary school in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Keith May, 9, asked Mauro if he and Bush were rivals the way
baseball stars Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, not really. Here's the difference: Sammy Sosa still has
a job, and though he lost the home run contest to Mark McGwire,
he's still an outfielder for the Chicago Cubs. If I don't win the
election, I won't have a job. So I think the relationship (between
Mauro and Bush) is a little strained.'' &QL;

 WICHITA, Kan.: come through.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some judges across the country have been hostile to the panel's
ruling. Since it was published on July 1, at least 16 federal
courts have published opinions after defense lawyers asked judges
to bar the testimony of cooperating witnesses. Of those, 13 of the
judges said the panel's decision was a flawed challenge to a
fundamental legal rule. Many other judges are thought to have made
similar rulings informally.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the rulings expressed fury or amazement that a
court would jeopardize so fundamental a tool. Judge Frederic
Smalkin of U.S. District Court in Maryland called the panel's
ruling ``amazingly unsound, not to mention nonsensical.''
</P>
<P>
   Several judges have noted that in the 50-year history of the
federal bribery law, no one had apparently suggested that
prosecutors were violating the law by offering witnesses leniency.
Several judges have also said that deals with cooperating witnesses
were standard practice beginning before the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling rejecting a defense request to bar a witness'
testimony, Judge Federico Moreno of the federal court in Florida
said, ``The holding of the Singleton panel would dangerously
disable the government's investigatory and prosecutorial powers.''
</P>
<P>
   But some federal judges have said that their job is to interpret
the law, not create it. Congress, said judges in Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., and Knoxville, Tenn., did not exclude prosecutors when it
drew up the bribery law. Prosecutors, therefore, must be covered by
the law, they ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Some judges have said that promising a defendant a reduced
sentence, no matter how common, could encourage false testimony.
``Regardless of the good faith of the individual prosecutor,'' said
District Court Judge Ginger Berrigan of Louisiana, ``any inducement
is as much if not more a temptation to fabricate than it is to tell
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel said it was to be expected that some judges would be
resistant to a new idea. Judges, he said, seem trapped in a ``Well,
come on, we've been doing it forever'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   But he said major legal changes had often come from a single
case, like the 1966 Miranda decision, which declared that all
criminal defendants must be informed of their rights.
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel, 53, said he did not know of an earlier case in which a
defense lawyer had claimed that a leniency deal was a violation of
the federal bribery law. In the Singleton case, he said, the idea
occurred to him as he struggled to defend his client against the
testimony of a cocaine dealer, Napoleon Douglas. Douglas had been a
friend of Ms. Singleton's boyfriend, who was also charged in a drug
distribution scheme that prosecutors called one of the biggest in
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel, a trial lawyer in one of Wichita's biggest law firms,
was appointed to defend Ms. Singleton because she could not afford
to hire her own lawyer. While he was working on the case, he said,
he came across an article written by a California lawyer who said
that it was unfair that prosecutors could offer incentives to
witnesses but defense lawyers could not.
</P>
<P>
   When the trial of Ms. Singleton began last year, Wachtel
unsuccessfully raised the issue of the bribery statute with the
federal judge in Wichita, Frank Theis. From the bench, Theis issued
an eight-word ruling: ``This statute does not apply to the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Singleton was convicted and sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel appealed and again raised the issue of the bribery
statute. The three-judge panel assigned to hear the case included
the chief judge of the appeals court, Stephanie Seymour, appointed
by President Carter, and two judges appointed by Presidents Reagan
and Bush, David Ebel and Paul Kelly Jr.
</P>
<P>
   In a densely worded 18-page opinion, the panel examined
precedents as far back as the Magna Carta, which imposed limits on
the exercise of sovereign power. The law prohibiting ``whoever''
from offering a witness anything of value in exchange for testimony
should apply, the judges said, to prosecutors as well as to
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decency, security and liberty alike,'' the panel said,
``demand that government officials shall be subject to the same
rules of conduct that are commands to the citizen.''

<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Sensing a singular opportunity in a
country weakened by a paralyzed government and an inexperienced
police force, Colombian and Dominican drug traffickers have made
Haiti the fastest-growing transit point for cocaine on its way to
the United States, American and Haitian law enforcement officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, the retired general who is President Clinton's
drug policy director, visited in early October and described the
situation as ``clearly an emergency,'' warning that Haiti had
become ``the principal focus'' of groups trafficking drugs in the
Caribbean. In an interview here, Pierre Denize, chief of the
Haitian National Police, offered an almost identical assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intensity of the problem is new and the capacity of law
enforcement, at least in the Republic of Haiti, is very limited,''
he said. ``We have limited resources, limited training, limited
intelligence and investigative capacity, and a very, very limited
capacity to control a coast that, geographically, is just across
the street from Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials estimate that 15 percent of all the cocaine
consumed in the United States now passes through Haiti, about four
tons a month. By their calculation, that figure has doubled in
little more than a year, and is, they say, in large part a result
of their increased success in blocking smuggling routes farther
east in the Caribbean, in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   All along Haiti's southern coast, indications of landings by
fast boats from Colombia have increased, as have reports of
airdrops in coastal waters. Seizures at the airport here are up,
especially on flights from places near Colombia, like Panama and
the Netherlands Antilles. U.S. Customs officials have noted a
corresponding increase in drugs found aboard Haitian freighters
docking in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of the surge in drug trafficking is that the Drug
Enforcement Administration and other American agencies are beefing
up their presence here and trying to forge closer ties with Haitian
agencies that are weak and inefficient. From just one agent here a
year ago, the DEA contingent is to grow to seven.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview here, Robert Manuel, Haiti's secretary of state
for public security, acknowledged that his country was the ``point
of least resistance'' in the region, and thus an attractive target
to the cocaine cartels. That is an inevitable result, he said, of
having to organize from scratch a 6,000-member civilian police
force, a process he called ``a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   After the landing of 20,000 American troops here four years ago,
the Haitian armed forces, which included a police force headed by
an officer later indicted in the United States on drug trafficking
charges, were abolished. The new police force includes a small
coast guard, but that force has one base and fewer than 10 vessels.
Most of those are fast boats confiscated from Colombian traffickers
and only about half of them are working at any one time.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti is also the poorest country in the hemisphere, and that
appeals greatly to traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cheaper place'' for cartels to operate than Mexico
or the Dominican Republic, an American official here said, with a
huge pool of hungry people desperate for any kind of work.
``Laborers earn 15 cents an hour, so getting people to risk their
lives is less difficult'' and the bribes that have to be paid are
smaller, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   But Haiti's traditional vulnerability has been amplified by a
political squabble between two factions of the Lavalas movement,
which has been in power since American troops deposed a military
dictatorship four years ago. The political crisis, which has lasted
16 months, has left the country without a functioning government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are always searching for the fissures, and they found one
in Haiti,'' McCaffrey said of the drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With the Haitian Parliament unable even to assemble a quorum,
several important drug-related legislative proposals are stalled.
Among them are a drug interdiction cooperation treaty with the
United States, bills that would increase penalties for drug
trafficking, possession or use, and comprehensive money-laundering
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recently arrested a gentleman going to Panama who was
carrying $1 million on his person,'' Denize said. ``He said to me,
`Chief, you should have told me you were arresting people and
waited for a day when I was really moving money.' He also assured
me there was absolutely no law or regulation he was violating,
which turned out to be absolutely true.''
</P>
<P>
   Haitian and American officials said that at least 60 Colombians
have been arrested on drug charges here in recent months. But
because of the government's inability to draft a budget to keep the
judicial system afloat, a shortage of judges and official
corruption, it is not clear how many Colombian prisoners have been
tried or convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some small victories,'' but many judges are
``not competent, scared and underpaid,'' Manuel said. ``We are
missing the judicial tools we need,'' he added, and the result is
that ``when violators get arrested, they get released by an
inefficient and corrupt judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   In public remarks, several members of the Haitian Congress have
asserted that much of the drug trade here is controlled by former
military and police officers who changed loyalties and are now
associates of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say they are investigating the matter, but
emphasize, as one put it, that there is as yet ``no evidence that
could lead to a prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the accusations, Denize said, ``I would need a
definition of `entourage.''' Manuel dismissed much of the talk as
the product of ``a very low level of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Aristide himself was said to be traveling and unavailable for
comment, but in the past he has dismissed such charges as attacks
by his political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Kurzban, an American lawyer who is general counsel for the
government of Haiti and a member of the board of the Aristide
Foundation for Democracy, described the allegations against
Aristide's associates as part of ``a concerted campaign of
disinformation'' intended to soil the former president's political
image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the former and the current president are really committed
to doing something about drugs, which they recognize as a long-term
threat to the stability of democracy in Haiti,'' Kurzban said.
``But they need a great deal of help from the United States, and
that help has not been forthcoming in a sufficient way.''
</P>
<P>
   American policy clearly is to continue to do everything possible
to fortify the police and judicial system here. But there also
seems to be a recognition that so long as the current paralysis
continues, the best results in interdicting drugs are likely to
come from working around, rather than in, Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to get a continuous U.S. presence offshore and
keep drugs from getting into Haiti,'' McCaffrey said. ``Our U.S.
defenses have to be on the far side of Haiti and the near side of
Haiti so that Haiti isn't overwhelmed by these incredibly organized
and violent drug criminals.''

   DRAGOBILJE, Yugoslavia _ Only a day before a NATO deadline and
under the threat of air strikes, Yugoslavia on Monday began what
appeared to be serious troop withdrawals from many positions in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers and policemen abandoned many positions they had
fortified over the last three months, and waited, with hard faces
and bandoleers of ammunition, for military buses to pick them up on
the roadsides.
</P>
<P>
   As ethnic Albanians watched the exodus of the soldiers and
policemen who had terrorized them, they expressed strong skepticism
about the withdrawal. There was skepticism, too, from NATO
officials who must verify that their withdrawal is sufficient to
avert air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great deal of caution here,'' said a senior NATO
official at the organization's headquarters in Brussels.
``Initially, the reports look very good, but we have been misled a
lot in the past by that government.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, along the major road westward from Kosovo's capital,
Pristina, hundreds of soldiers and paramilitary policemen were
pouring out of bunkers and appeared to be essentially ceding the
strategic areas along the roads to ethnic Albanian rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Monday afternoon a bulldozer was pushing aside the
sandbags that had protected a large and menacing police checkpoint
that stood for more than a year some 15 miles from the capital. The
checkpoint, which had been guarded by artillery, tanks and armored
personnel carriers, was staffed on Monday afternoon by seven
officers who no longer bothered to stop cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what we can see so far it is looking very good,'' said
Shaun Byrnes, the head of the American monitoring mission. ``It
looks as if all the police are gone from around here, except for
Malisevo and Dulje,'' he said, referring to the area's largest
towns.
</P>
<P>
   But as he spoke, the first sign of what could be the next
stumbling block to an early peace in Kosovo appeared. A small red
car carrying four men armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles pulled
up on a muddy track leading from the mountains and sped away down
the smooth asphalt of the main highway. The guerrillas of the
Kosovo Liberation Army were back, three months after the start of a
brutal government offensive that drove them away, and on Monday
they were moving into the territory as government forces left it.
</P>
<P>
   To put an end to government attacks on civilians and to
encourage the return of the approximately 250,000 civilians driven
from their homes, Western governments demanded that Yugoslavia
reduce the number of soldiers and policemen in Kosovo province to
February's levels.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, facing threats of
NATO air strikes, said on Oct. 13 that he could comply, and NATO
suspended the threat until Oct. 27 to see if he would keep his
word.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, NATO's two top generals went to Belgrade to
tell Milosevic that he was not moving quickly enough and to renew
their threats of air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The generals _ NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, an
American, and Gen. Klaus Naumann, a German _ got the Yugoslav
military to agree on an exact list of police and military units to
be withdrawn, according to NATO officials.
</P>
<P>
   The generals got so precise in their demands that hours were
spent discussing details like which government checkpoints would
have to be taken down, NATO officials say.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon on Monday, Western diplomats say, police and
military units in many parts of Kosovo suddenly seemed to be on the
move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having a hard time keeping track of it all,'' a diplomat
said. ``Each unit pulling out is supposed to go to a specific
place, either back to garrison in Kosovo, or back to its base
somewhere else in the country. But all that we can tell for sure at
this point is that they're moving, and I hope they are not just
moving around to try and fool us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At dusk, along the road west from Pristina, where villages had
recently been plundered and burned by government forces, smoke was
rising from homes again. This time, the acts of destruction seemed
to be a final gesture by the departing police.
</P>
<P>
   Thick, acrid black smoke swirled out from a blazing farmhouse
near here and twisted above the heavily armed policemen climbing
into a bus. The family's tractor and wagon were also burning.
</P>
<P>
   At another fortified position, policemen stood sullenly waiting
to be picked up, some wearing blue bandanas around their heads. The
litter from their stay _ loaves of bread turning green, opened cans
of tuna fish and fruit cocktail and cases of empty beer bottles _
marked the edge of their camp as much as the barbed wire and
trenches.
</P>
<P>
   When their bus arrived, it was accompanied by an armored
personnel carrier, on which the turret with its cannon swung
quickly toward the wooded hills nearby to cover their retreat from
any rebel forces hiding there.
</P>
<P>
   While Western diplomats have condemned the cold-bloodedness of
the government attacks on ethnic Albanian civilians and rebels, the
West does not support the rebels' goal of an independent Kosovo.
Diplomats and NATO officers worry that by forcing Yugoslavia to
pull back its forces they will also help the rebels advance.
</P>
<P>
   In this village, deep in Central Kosovo, as a few civilians
fearfully ventured down from the mountains where they had been
hiding from government forces, rebels accompanied them.
</P>
<P>
   The area commander for the rebels here in Dragobilje, who would
not give his name, said: ``For now, I can't say the police are
leaving. They have just reduced their numbers a little, I can't say
how much. I think it is just a tactical maneuver, and they could
all be back again.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, more and more of his armed men began showing up in the
fields and footpaths around here.
</P>
<P>
   It took a ferocious military offensive to dislodge the rebels
from here this summer, and it seemed unlikely that they would be
easily removed again, especially because NATO has ordered the
government to be more humane and international monitors are keeping
a fairly close watch.
</P>
<P>
   A villager, Skender Paqarizi, 47, said he thought that the
apparent departure of government forces and the arrival of rebel
units would give refugees who fled their homes the confidence to
return. ``That's what we all hope for,'' he said, ``But the army
usually shells during the night. Let's see what happens tonight.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The merging of two large high-pressure systems over the East
will meet with some resistance as a disturbance at 15,000 feet over
Lake Ontario migrates toward the southeast. The combination of
onshore winds along the New England Coast and mid-atmospheric
moisture streaming in from Canada will produce variable clouds and
a few sprinkles over the northern Appalachians and in southern New
England. Maine will be bright and cool while the Middle Atlantic
region will have streamers of clouds, but it will be seasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Southeast will be sunny and pleasantly warm as high
pressure settles over the Tennessee Valley. Onshore winds in
Florida will bring in ocean clouds and scattered showers, mainly
from Orlando southward. Intense Hurricane Mitch, with central winds
near 180 mph, will approach the Yucatan peninsula late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of clouds and showers will weaken as it moves through
the Middle West. Winds from the southwest will draw mild, humid air
into the region. A cold front will progress through the northeast
Plains with just some clouds and shifting winds.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and showers will keep temperatures below seasonal levels
in the eastern and central Rockies. A few strong afternoon
thunderstorms may form in western Texas. High pressure near Montana
will promote bright but cooler conditions. California and the
deserts of the Southwest will become mainly sunny and not as cool
as in recent days. A cold front will push inland across the
Northwest late in the day with windswept showers spreading into
western Washington and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Monster Storm
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane hunter aircraft investigating Hurricane Mitch in the
northwest Caribbean Sea on Monday found one of the most powerful
hurricanes to ever roam the Atlantic Ocean. With winds near 180 mph
and a central pressure of 26.72 inches of mercury, Hurricane Mitch
was classified as a catastrophic Category Five storm on the
Saffir/Simpson hurricane scale. Only a few other Atlantic storms
have reached this intensity. The strongest, and most recent,
Hurricane Gilbert, attained winds of 185 mph and a pressure of
26.22 inches of mercury in nearly the same location during
September 1988.

WHILE GLENN GETS GLORY FOR SPACEFLIGHT, NASA CARRIES BURDEN OVER
HIS SAFETY 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ John Glenn gets the glory for taking his
77-year-old body back into space. NASA shoulders the grief over his
safety and physical well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Both hope the scales of risk and reward will balance by placing
the often overlooked research that NASA conducts in space in the
media spotlight surrounding the aging Mercury astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't make this the John Glenn flight. You all make this
the John Glenn flight,'' Discovery commander Curt Brown said. ``Our
job is to go up, do research and make the shuttle flights efficient
and safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown and his crew arrived at the Kennedy Space Center in
Florida Monday as the countdown began for the medical research
mission scheduled to lift off at 1 p.m. CDT on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 3,500 requests for credentials to cover the
launch, a total that surpasses such events as the first Apollo moon
voyage and the first shuttle launch after the Challenger disaster.
</P>
<P>
   From the major broadcast and cable news networks to the History
Channel, Glenn and his 1962 landmark orbital flight are premium
programming.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1986 Challenger accident attests, NASA administrator Dan
Goldin's decision in January to launch a senior citizen of Glenn's
stature as part of the agency's 40th anniversary celebration was a
roll of the dice.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio senator's safety is the linchpin behind the success of
the unusual venture.
</P>
<P>
   The Challenger tragedy claimed the lives of seven astronauts,
among them New Hampshire schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe. The
deaths plunged the nation into a prolonged period of reassessment
over the inherent risks of its space program and its goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make the shuttle as safe as possible, but there is always a
finite risk,'' Goldin acknowledged. ``(Glenn is) going into space
at 77 because deep down in his inner being he feels the rewards of
going to space are worth the potential risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn addressed the issue when NASA honored his request to fly
as a subject in a range experiments that will attempt to link the
stresses of spaceflight to the natural aging process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly have a lot of confidence in this thing, or I would
not be volunteering to go,'' Glenn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a time when we thought the emphasis on
safety was a little less than it should have been, but those days
are behind us,'' he said. ``The track record is there for everyone
to look at how that danger has been dealt with since Challenger,
and I think NASA has done an outstanding job.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's flight will be the 92nd for the shuttle, the 67th since
Challenger.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle's safety margin has improved greatly in recent
years, largely because of safety modifications to the shuttle's
primary rocket engines.
</P>
<P>
   The median probability of a catastrophic accident during liftoff
is currently one in 438, improved from one in 120 in 1989, said
NASA spokeswoman Jennifer McCarter. Meanwhile, the probability of
catastrophe throughout a mission from liftoff to landing is
currently one in 233.
</P>
<P>
   With less fanfare, the space agency has also looked at the
health risk to Glenn, which is higher than for a younger astronaut,
though NASA will not quantify by how much
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Glenn's flight, it added a portable defibrillator to
the shuttle's medical kit and drugs that can be administered if
there is a heart-stopping allergic reaction during one of the
mission's experiments.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dave Williams, the physician-astronaut who serves
as NASA's director of life sciences, Glenn met all of the
cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological qualifications to fly
as well as the hearing and vision requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned about being able to take the rigors of space
physically,'' said Glenn. ``I think that is something I will be
able to do quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   Physician-astronaut Scott Parazynski, an emergency medicine
specialist, will serve as Discovery's medical officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is a considerable risk, but regardless we
just have to be prepared,'' said Parazynski. ``We are flying a
considerable amount of capability. It's not like being in an
emergency room, things just take longer in (the weightlessness) of
space.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of any crew member who became ill or injured, the
shuttle's medical officer would first attempt to stabilize his
patient's condition, treat it if possible or prepare for an
emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   The situation aboard the orbiting spacecraft would be discussed
between the shuttle's commander and the flight surgeon in mission
control. Shuttle managers would decide if an emergency landing was
warranted.
</P>
<P>
   The re-entry and landing would require about six hours,
according to Parazynski.
</P>
<P>
   The procedures and precautions in place at NASA before Glenn's
launch were sufficient, said Phil Engelhauf, mission control's lead
flight director for Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA has addressed that issue and acknowledged the fact there
is a slight increase in risk for an older person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he contends it's equivalent to the risk Glenn faces when he
exerts himself in a similar fashion on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do everything we can to minimize risk,'' said Engelhauf.
``We have reviewed all the procedures and practices to see if there
is anything we could do or should do to protect the individual in
that age bracket any better than we do right now. We have not come
up with anything.'' &QL;

WEST BANK KILLINGS MAR PEACE ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEBRON, West Bank _ Within 24 hours after Israeli Prime Minister
Benjammin Netanyahu returned home from the United States with a
peace deal, the bloodshed began in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   A Jewish settler was gunned down Monday afternoon. Hours later
the body of a Palestinian man was found in what police are
investigating as a possible retaliatory killing.
</P>
<P>
   The violence has fueled anger among Jewish settlers and
Palestinian militants, who have vowed to crush the hopes created by
the land-for-security agreement signed Friday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   An assault from the Israeli far right and ultranationalist
settlers who oppose the peace deal leaves Netanyahu's coalition
government vulnerable. Nevertheless, he easily survived the first
``no confidence'' vote Monday in the Knesset, Israel's parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu owes his success largely to the leftist Labor Party,
which has vowed to give him cover from the extreme right, at least
until he implements the troop withdrawls called for in the new
interim peace agreement. Critics, especially the National Religious
Party, are still promising to take more concerted action next
month. If successful, a no-confidence vote would force new
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Signs that Netanyahu does not want to lose the support of the
settlers were evident on his first day back in Israel, as he began
to scale down rhetorically some of the promises he made last week
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said he would continue his policy of building housing
for Jews in Jerusalem and areas adjacent to the existing West Bank
settlements despite a one-year appeal for a ``time out'' on
settlement expansion by the US government. US officials told
reporters after the summit last week that the Israelis had agreed
to the ``time out.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu told Israel Army Radio, ``We are building throughout
the Land of Israel and also in Jerusalem. That will not change.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would soon award contracts for construction of
Har Homa, the controversial settlement on the edge of mainly Arab
East Jerusalem. Netanyahu's greenlight for the project on a
hillside referred to in Arabic as Jabal Abu Ghneim was generally
regarded as the point at which the peace process broke down 19
months ago. A subsequent wave of attacks by the military wing of
the Islamic militant group Hamas left the process derailed until
last Friday, when Netanyahu agreed to an Israeli withdrawal from a
further 13 percent of West Bank land, bringing the total to 40
percent under total or partial control of Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers stake a biblical claim to the West Bank, captured by
Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Six Day War.
</P>
<P>
   The settlers, wearing the knitted skullcaps of the
ultranationalists and many carrying machine guns, came by the
busload for a large demonstration outside Netanyahu's home last
night.
</P>
<P>
   They declared that the death of 29-year-old Danny Vargas, a
settler from Kiryat Arba near Hebron, was proof that there can be
no peace with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have casualties in war, you don't have casualties in
peace,'' said Rachel Klein, a resident of Kiryat Arba who attended
the rally. ``To give away the Land of Israel is a treasonous,
treacherous act by Netanyahu.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of about 300 protesters demanded Netanyahu resign and
called him a ``liar'' and a ``traitor'' for pledging to withdraw
Israeli troops from West Bank land after they elected him on the
promise that he would never cede land to Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas, a Chilean-born father of two and a guard for Kiryat
Arba's power plant, was shot at close range by suspected
Palestinian militants and dumped on a side street in the divided
city of Hebron, Israeli police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that the gunmen abducted Vargas's car and fled to
the Palestinian-controlled part of Hebron, where Palestinian police
later recovered the bloodstained vehicle. There was no immediate
claim of responsibility in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, at the Vargas home in a row of bleak cinder-block
housing units, his pregnant wife, Tali, brushed away tears as
friends and family led her to a nearby apartment to tell her
3-year-old son what happened to his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``This murder is a message to the prime minister that this
agreement is very dangerous,'' said Yehoshua Shani, a neighbor and
friend of Vargas. ``This is not nationalist, or religious, this is
just reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Vargas's murder, the body of a Palestinian man was
found near the Jewish settlement of Itamar outside the West Bank
town of Nablus. Israeli radio reported that police had received a
call altering them to the location of the body in an olive grove.
Israel radio reported the ``Jewish caller'' said ``the killing was
in response'' to Vargas's death.
</P>
<P>
   The body was reportedly that of a 72-year-old Palestinian man
who was believed to have worked at the settlement picking olives.
</P>
<P>
   David Wilder, a settler and spokesman for the Jewish Community
of Hebron, condemned the attack, saying, ``It's not the way we are
going to solve the problems. It's bad enough that they kill us
randomly and for no reason. We should not do the same thing. It
accomplishes nothing.''

MARKET PLACE: SOROS MAKING SOME CHANGES IN HIS FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Previously slugged SOROS-FUNDS)  
(lb) 
 By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Soros, one of the world's most famous investors, is
making several changes at his Quantum Group of mutual funds after
poor investment returns in the recent months of global financial
turmoil, with some funds showing declines of more than 15 percent
so far this year. One fund, which Soros is proposing to close, has
lost more than 30 percent of its value this year.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the investment returns and Soros' response in
recent days show that even one of the world's pre-eminent investors
_ who has made billions of dollars out of inspired and
well-informed speculation in world financial markets _ has taken
something of a battering this year, not least because of the severe
downturn in emerging markets. Earlier this year, the Soros Group
said it had lost about $2 billion in Russia, which defaulted on its
debts in August.
</P>
<P>
   In an Oct. 23 letter to shareholders in Quantum funds, Soros
told investors that Nicholas Roditi, his star fund manager of
recent years, would ``take a temporary medical leave of absence,''
that Quantum proposes to merge two of its funds _ Quasar
International and Quantum Industrial Holdings _ and that it would
close Quantum Emerging Growth, which had lost 31.16 percent of its
value as of last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Soros funds, which are incorporated in Curacao, in the
Netherlands Antilles, may be sold only to non-U.S. investors. But
their performances are widely watched worldwide, not least because
of Soros' reputation as a canny investor.
</P>
<P>
   They generally charge a management fee of 1 percent of assets
and carry an incentive fee of 20 percent of profits earned. The
minimum investment is generally hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Druckenmiller, chief investment strategist for Soros
Fund Management, the company that oversees Quantum Group, will
temporarily take over Roditi's responsibilities for overseeing much
of the management of the Quota and Quasar funds, Soros' letter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Bernheim, the publisher of the U.S. Offshore Funds
Directory, a listing of hedge funds, characterized the Soros funds'
returns so far this year as ``a recent disappointment'' against an
``outstanding longstanding record.''
</P>
<P>
   That record owes much to Roditi, a London money manager who
hails from southern Africa and who closely guards his privacy.
Reached at his office in the north London borough of Hampstead last
year, Roditi refused requests for interviews with the phrase ``I
don't talk to journalists''; he routinely asks friends not to talk
about him to the media.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a life-threatening illness some years ago, described
Monday as tuberculosis by friends who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``He did not look well,'' one executive said Monday who
saw Roditi last week when the Soros manager visited New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply do not know how long his absence will be,'' Shawn
Pattison, a spokesman for Soros Fund Management, said Monday in a
written answer to questions about Roditi. ``It is Roditi's hope, as
well as ours here at Soros Fund Management, that it will be of a
short duration,'' he wrote. Pattison's note said Roditi ``has been
Soros Fund Management's most trusted adviser.'' Pattison said
Monday that Roditi would not answer journalists' questions.
</P>
<P>
   The Quota fund, which Roditi manages, has seen a 13.64 percent
decline in its value as of last Thursday, according to Pattison.
That decline reflects ``the recent market turmoil,'' Pattison said.
Recent months aside, Quota has turned in high returns. In 1997, it
earned 49.3 percent; in 1996, 81.9 percent, and in 1995 it earned a
staggering 159.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking last year, Bernheim said that Quota ``has been the most
successful hedge fund over the five years 1992 to 1996, with an
annual compound return of 56.6 percent.'' Discussing Roditi's
strategy then, he said: ``He takes very large positions on his
convictions. When it works, it produces spectacular returns.''
</P>
<P>
   But this year has not been such a good one for many investors,
including the Soros funds. Soros' flagship, the Quantum fund, was
up 4.3 percent as of last Thursday and now has $8.7 billion under
management, including deferred fees, Pattison said Monday. Last
year it made 17.2 percent, in 1996 it was down 1.5 percent and in
1995 it earned 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Quantum Industrial Holdings, with assets of about $2 billion,
saw a 19 percent fall in its value as of last Thursday, according
to Soros Fund Management. That compares poorly with returns of 49.8
percent in 1995, 16.6 percent in 1996 and 21.9 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Quasar fund, meanwhile, has lost 18.8 percent of its value
this year, with assets of $969 million as of last Thursday. That
compares with returns of 8 percent last year, 8.5 percent in 1996
and 47.5 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   This year's lackluster performance at Quantum Emerging Growth,
which had $1.5 billion under management as of last week, contrasts
starkly with the fund's high returns of 22.3 percent in 1997, 37.9
percent in 1996 and 21.6 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   While the emerging markets have not been kind to Soros, some
significant U.S. investments have not gone well, either. The Soros
funds, for example, have invested in Waste Management Inc., the
Houston waste company, which has performed poorly. Pattison
declined to comment on that investment on Monday.

 &HT;    Market's rebound divides bulls from bears
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's probably too early to go bottom fishing in the
stock market, but not too early to look for a bottom. Finding one
bottom is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts contend the 12 percent rebound by the Dow Jones
industrial average from its Aug. 31 low is reason to believe the
worst of the selling is over.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts contend stocks have not shed enough of their
excessive valuation, and the summer-fall sell-off has not followed
a pattern that would suggest a bottom has been hit.
</P>
<P>
   Author and strategist William J. O'Neil _ founder of Investor's
Business Daily _ said bear markets traditionally have ``three down
legs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The major averages decline, then consolidate _ or move
sideways _ for awhile, decline again, consolidate and decline a
third time before finally bottoming out,'' O'Neil wrote in his
latest book, ``Guide to the Markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, O'Neil wrote, you never know if the market will
follow that pattern. Some bear markets have been known to sink more
than three times.
</P>
<P>
   There's the rub.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to track market trends based on history is akin to
forecasting life expectancy. An insurance actuary can be pretty
sure how long your age group will live, but not you. Ditto with
forecasting a particular market.
</P>
<P>
   There's an agreed-upon body of evidence about what the bottom _
or the top_ of a market looks like. The current evidence is mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say bear market bottoms are usually marked by extremely
bearish sentiment (far worse than now), heavy selling of blue-chip
stocks (they have rallied instead), bad corporate earnings (the
third-quarter per share average for Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 companies
is down 3.2 percent from last year), mutual fund liquidations
(there has been some), economic weakness (this is widely expected)
and rising interest rates (they are down).
</P>
<P>
   This makes it difficult to be sure the Dow's Aug. 31 close was
the low of the sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson-Humphrey strategist Robert S. Robbins, expressing
``strong confidence in a new bull market,'' says it was.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins bases his conclusion on several factors, including the
Federal Reserve's two recent economy-boosting interest rate cuts,
prospects for rate cuts by other major industrialized nations, the
continuation of weak U.S. inflation and investor sentiment
indicating ``a nearby market low.''
</P>
<P>
   But if this really is a bear market, it probably isn't over yet,
according to Ricky T. Harrington, technical analyst for
Interstate/Johnson Lane. Bear markets typically last more than
three months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a short-term basis, the market has shown characteristics of
a bottom,'' said Harrington. ``But these markets tend to be
extremely volatile and can change very quickly. A month from now,
those characteristics may not be as positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's analyst Mark D. Arbeter said one thing that
won't change soon is big daily price swings.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the next couple of months, we see the major averages
trading in a wide range as the market tries to build a base,'' said
Arbeter. ``During a base-building period, price action can be
extremely volatile, but the net result is little change.''
</P>
<P>
   What's the individual investor to do?
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said the best thing is to remain diversified, with
some money in bonds as well as stocks and cash (money market funds,
for example).
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you can't stand a 30 percent correction in stocks, then
don't be heavily weighted in stocks,'' he added. ``You've got to
know your own ability to stand risk.''

GLENN'S ORBIT ENDURES BUT CAN'T BRIDGE GENERATIONS

<P>
   HOUSTON _ You can read all the historical accounts, watch every
Hollywood treatment of those early NASA years, and still not get
it.
</P>
<P>
   You simply had to be there when John Glenn made his rocket-fired
lap around the Earth to understand the wonder of it all.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were _ listening to the radio at work, or glued to a
grainy, black-and-white television image _ probably have a pretty
good crop of gray hair by now.
</P>
<P>
   But even when memory fails on other topics, many from Glenn's
generation remember exactly where they were and who they were with
when the clean-cut astronaut took his famous ride. And they
remember the pure joy of that shared experience. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``I admire him so much for his commitment to this country,''
gushed Fred Sweat, 80. ``God bless him!''
</P>
<P>
   But at Houston's Challenger Center, where kids get to fly a
simulated space shuttle mission, the youngsters are less than
bowled over by Glenn's return to orbit, scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids my age don't think much about Mercury and John Glenn,''
said Seabrook, Texas, Intermediate School student Jeff Nickeson,
13. ``They know about Apollo because of the Tom Hanks movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking to people like Sweat, people who wear the passage of
time more obviously than Glenn, is a reminder of just how
remarkable the astronaut's current mission is.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of his age group admire Glenn's mental agility and
agree that he's in much better shape than the average 77-year-old,
but they are far from being of one mind when it comes to his making
a return trip into space.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that age, I'd think it was a cinch,'' cracked Abe Bogart,
94. ``It'd be easier than at my age!''
</P>
<P>
   Bogart and some of his neighbors at The Hampton at Post Oak, a
high-rise retirement community near the Galleria, were meeting for
happy hour on a recent afternoon. They were young like Glenn when
he made the first flight, and many remembered the event in snapshot
detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were visiting there in Florida _ in Miami,'' said
80-year-old Joyce Brewer. ``We were on vacation. One of the big
bands was playing in the hotel. We went out and watched the
television in the lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer said she'd be scared to death to travel into space at her
age, adding that she'd be afraid for her health. ``I think it's
great he wants to go, but I wonder why,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' countered Lenore Hart, 73. ``I don't know how
anyone could think otherwise,'' she said, adding with a grin, ``I
like adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Glenn, 86, said he's from Ohio, like his astronaut
namesake, but isn't related. He was working for Transco Energy of
Houston in the early '60s, and remembered being fascinated with
every detail of the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course. It was a first,'' Glenn said. ``I'm an engineer and
I just love that stuff. But I think he's too old (now), I really
do. I'd love to go,'' he said, ``but what it costs to put him up
there, no, I wouldn't spend the money on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Selma Geller, 80, was a secretary at a Houston insurance agency
when John Glenn made his first orbit. ``I remember hearing it on
the radio and thinking, how fantastic!''
</P>
<P>
   But now, Geller said she thinks Glenn's taking a terrible
chance. Nevertheless, she said she and her husband will be watching
when he lifts off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope he comes back,'' said giggling 76-year-old Lorraine
Boehme, tucked in next to her husband, Herman, 79. A former
professor at Texas Woman's University, Boehme is fatalistic about
the potential dangers of the flight and doesn't think it should
hold Glenn back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, why not?'' Boehme asked. ``You've got to die some way
_ I'd just as soon go in a big experiment. What a happy way to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's flight was a seminal moment in U.S. history, but many
children said they aren't necessarily learning about it in school.
Quizzing the recent group at the Challenger Center revealed that
about three-fourths of them knew who Glenn is.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Ruiz, a 12-year-old student at Hamilton Middle School
said, no, she doesn't know who John Glenn is and hadn't studied
about him in school. And she isn't really interested in space, she
said, ``unless they take kids like me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Katie Nava, another 12-year-old at Hamilton, passed the pop
quiz with flying colors. ``He used to be an astronaut. Then he went
into Congress. Now he wants to go back into outer space,'' Nava
said. She expressed concern about his health and thinks maybe he's
too old.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Parker, an 11-year-old Boy Scout at Pershing Middle
School in Houston, said he really doesn't have much interest in
space _ especially when it comes to the kind of missions that are
standard for the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like going to Mars and stuff,'' Parker said. ``But when
you go up and study science and stuff, it gets kind of boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Moore, 13, from Seabrook Intermediate, lives in a
community where astronauts are neighbors. Her father is a NASA
contractor and she's jazzed enough about the space program that she
attended the Space Academy in Huntsville, Ala., last summer.
</P>
<P>
   But while the coordinator of the Seabrook Science Magnet Program
said astronauts occasionally come to speak at the school and her
students are easily interested in space, Moore said she was never
taught about Glenn in class.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't even cover it (space) much in history,'' Moore
said. ``I probably learned most of what I know from Space
Academy.''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't expect her friends to pay much attention to Glenn's
flight. ``The average kid doesn't care,'' she said. ``They have
other things to worry about.'' &QL;

   Bush brothers: Politics is a family affair
</P>
<P>
   By Ken Herman
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ If the voters of Florida and Texas back the Bushes on
Nov. 3, the brothers will be able to measure their family tree
against other clans that have planted deep roots in American
politics.
</P>
<P>
   George W. and younger brother Jeb, both running ahead in the
pre-election polls, may be about to join the Rockefellers _ Nelson
of New York (1958-73) and Winthrop of Arkansas (1967-71) _ as the
only brothers to serve simultaneously as governors.
</P>
<P>
   Factor in their famous father, and the Bushes will be up there
with the Kennedys as political royalty.
</P>
<P>
   And if George W. becomes president in 2001, the Bushes would
join John Adams and John Quincy Adams as the only father-and-son
presidential teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush boys, however, are not putting on airs. Mature new
leadership for a new millennium? Maybe. But then there is this kind
of insight from Jeb on life in a famous family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a wedgie from the governor of the State of Texas,'' he
told a Fort Lauderdale audience in March 1997. ``If I didn't eat my
broccoli, I was sent to my room by a president of the United
States. And whenever I really misbehaved, I got spanked by the most
popular woman on the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 10 days out from an election that could make history, the
brothers Bush are focused on their races but not ignoring family
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be a big deal to have two brothers as governors
of the second- and fourth-most-populous states,'' said George W.
</P>
<P>
   Folks who have watched the Bush brothers _ who have two younger
brothers and a younger sister _ say there are striking similarities
and defining differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``George and Jeb do differ,'' said former President Bush, ``but
it's mainly in style. In terms of substance, they are both
committed to improvement in education in their states and to other
worthy objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   And both of his political sons ``exude enthusiasm and
conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   ` `They like people, and I think that comes shining through for
both of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Hill, a Houston political consultant who worked on Jeb's
unsuccessful 1994 gubernatorial race, said the brothers ``are
certainly not twins or clones.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always asked how could two brothers from the same gene
pool be so different,'' he said. ``George grew up in Midland. Jeb
grew up in River Oaks. Jeb seems the more studious, more the policy
maven.''
</P>
<P>
   Politically, Hill sees similarities clustered around a
philosophy that is ``fiscally conservative, yet socially
moderate.''
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, he sees Jeb as a guy more likely to hang out with
policy ``wonks.'' George W., according to Hill, gets more points
for ability to work with politicians of differing stripes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jeb is still a work in progress,'' Hill said. ``At one
moment his instincts are libertarian, hands-off, and the next
moment he wants a coordinated effort to help economic
development.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiritually, both boys strayed from the family's flock.
Ex-President Bush and wife Barbara are Episcopalians. George W.,
now 52, became a Methodist when he married Laura Welch. Jeb, 45,
converted to Catholicism, his wife Columba's religion.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, the differences are well-defined.
</P>
<P>
   ``George is a little more relaxed. He is more interested in
people. Jeb is more interested in issues,'' Hill said. ``I would
bet a million dollars on which one was easiest to get to do his
homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas first lady Laura Bush says her husband and brother-in-law
are ``very, very different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeb is much quieter. He is probably the quietest of the
brothers,'' she said. ``Jeb is very focused. He is very determined.
He graduated from the University of Texas in three years, Phi Beta
Kappa, because he wanted to marry Columba, who was his only
girlfriend. He spent his whole time at Texas writing love letters
to her and making straight A's.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush brothers are hesitant to talk about each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people would say on the surface I'm a little more
happy-go-lucky than he is, a little looser,'' said George W. ``On
the other hand, I know Jeb to be a guy who loves a good laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's one Jeb tells these days. It works, but it tells you he
is the kind of guy given to reading books without pictures. It's
from the somewhat obscure Roman numeral series of jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what this means?'' he asks, shaping thumb and
forefinger into an L. ``It's Julius Caesar ordering 50 beers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rim shot.
</P>
<P>
   On the trail
</P>
<P>
   Political consultant Robin Rorapaugh has been watching Jeb at
work these past few months. Rorapaugh, who has run several
Democratic campaigns in Texas, now runs Democrat Buddy McKay's
campaign against Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   She is envious of a talent she detects in both Bushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are both very clever at working at becoming all
things to all people,'' she said. ``They have managed to do one
thing their father could never do: hold the extreme right at bay so
they can speak to moderate voters.''
</P>
<P>
   From Florida, she has sensed the aura that engulfs George W.'s
campaign events.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same with Jeb,'' she said. ``He is treated like a
rock star.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush brother campaign events have a similar feel. Both are very
much into handshake-to-handshake campaigning. By style and
pedigree, they transcend politics and cross over into the
consciousness of the nonpolitical.
</P>
<P>
   A George W. Bush event is a happening, short on speech and heavy
on full-contact campaigning. Handshakes (complete with simultaneous
shoulder slap) and photos for all.
</P>
<P>
   By Nov. 3, if you don't have the governor's autograph or a photo
of you and Bush, you're not trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to work all the cameras,'' said travel aide Logan
Walters, who encourages folks to step right up and have your photo
taken with the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush critics say he is more style than substance. But along the
campaign trail, Bush backers say style has a lot to do with why
they love the guv.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter likes him,'' said Marsha Dowell of Corpus Christi.
``When he saw her the second time, he remembered her.''
</P>
<P>
   On this day, the Dowells waited for Bush so they could show him
the photo of him and daughter Dawn taken two years ago. In the
Dowell family, Dawn's growth can be tracked in photos of her and
the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Similar scenes unfold in Florida. In Tampa last week, splotches
of ink stained Jeb's hands as he worked to make sure autograph
supply kept up with demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think he is incredible,'' said Anne Beckles, 68, of
Tampa. ``He's going to be a wonderful governor. I voted for his
father both times.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers also pitch similar issues on the campaign trail.
Education is No. 1 for both.
</P>
<P>
   And they spout similar philosophy about their generation. George
W. complains about a generation that lives by an
``if-it-feels-good-do-it'' mantra.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida in 1994, Jeb hit the trail with a stump speech
bemoaning the ``therapeutic age'' in which ``everybody is a
victim'' and TV talk shows are filled with people who ``are a
victim of society because they are a transvestite.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Jeb has moved toward the moderate, still backing
issues like school vouchers, but working hard to collect
middle-of-the-road votes.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show it's working. A Mason-Dixon poll completed in
mid-October showed him with a 10-point lead. Courting the
unexpected
</P>
<P>
   In Texas and Florida, the Bush brothers are pushing the
political envelope by seeking support among unnatural
constituencies. George W. wants the Hispanic vote that has been
locked up by Democrats for generations. Though he apologizes for
his Spanish, it has become a valuable tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a conservative con un corazon (with a heart),'' he said in
Corpus Christi, moving smoothly into the South Texas custom of
mixing languages in a single sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Jeb refocused his efforts after the 1994 loss to
Democratic incumbent Lawton Chiles. The retooled Jeb knows he needs
a breakthrough to black voters.
</P>
<P>
   He formed a foundation, using his campaign to run it, and began
courting blacks. Working with civil rights activist T. Willard
Fair, Jeb was instrumental in opening a charter school in
inner-city Miami.
</P>
<P>
   He also began meeting with black leaders around the state.
Earlier this year, Jeb became a major beneficiary of a Democratic
intramural skirmish. White state Democratic House members tossed
out Willie Logan, the first black Democratic leader, in a move that
splintered the party. Logan endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Jeb began meeting with Jewish leaders
throughout Florida. The politicking paid off. The Jewish Journal,
an influential South Florida newspaper, wrote a glowing endorsement
of Bush, saying he was more attuned to concerns of Jews _
traditionally a fountain of support for Democrats _ than was McKay,
the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   And like big brother, Jeb has picked up support from big-name
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeb Bush has done an extraordinary job of bringing into the
Republican Party two groups who up until now would have felt
uncomfortable even thinking about it,'' said Susan MacManus, who
studies state politics at the University of South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb also is getting money from an unexpected source. He has
collected $1 million from Texans. His big brother organized it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said come to the state, what can I do to help you,'' said
George W., recalling the four Texas events he set up. ``I went out
of my way to help my brother raise as much money as we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should Texans give money to someone running for governor of
Florida?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope one reason is because his older brother asked,'' said
the governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Escaping the shadow
</P>
<P>
   As those who have had one know, a famous father can be asset and
burden. In 1994, while campaigning, Jeb said he moved to Florida
for the same reason many people do: to get away from something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to leave Houston to get out from the shadow of my
dad,'' he said. ``At the time, I thought that was important.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush has done well in the Sunshine State. In 1981 he helped
found the Miami-based Codina Group, now the largest full-service
commercial real estate company in South Florida. He left the firm
to run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush also talks about her father-in-law's shadow and its
effect on the political sons. From her point of view, escaping it
had nothing to do with moving vans.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, the '92 defeat (of President Bush), as hard as
it was on George and Jebby _ in a lot of ways it was the first time
in their lives they were liberated from the shadow of their dad,''
she said. ``It was literally the first time they felt like they
could say whatever they thought, without it reflecting on their
father, without having to think: How would this sound?''
</P>
<P>
   For both brothers, the political downside of the shadow has been
charges that everything they've accomplished _ in business and
politics _ was somehow preordained the moment they were conceived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh come on,'' said Garry Mauro, George W.'s foe, when asked if
the Bush brothers could be where they are if they weren't the Bush
brothers. ``The answer to that question is so obvious. Of course
they couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes _ the dad (whose father was a U.S. senator) and the
two sons _ insist there was never a family meeting at which they
set out a game plan to become a political dynasty of historic
proportion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not like thinking in terms of dynasty,'' said the former
president, ``and I do not like comparing my family to any others. I
know that dynasty stories seem to be cropping up, but all I can say
is I have great pride in both my sons and am very pleased that
these two, decent, honest young men are willing to get into what
Teddy Roosevelt called `the arena,' especially at this time when so
many people are turned off by politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his dad, George W. is eager to have a Nov. 3 double
victory read as a major family accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it speaks volumes about what kind of dad he was,
because if he had been a bad dad, I think both of us, who are
fathers ourselves, would have been hesitant to go into an arena
where it would have compromised your ability to be a good dad,'' he
said. 'I think people would say on the surface I'm a little more
happy-go-lucky than he is. On the other hand, I know Jeb to be a
guy who loves a good laugh.'

 &HT;    Castro asks for cut of baseball profit
 &HT;    By Rich Oppel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Noting the success of Cuban players, Fidel Castro
proposed Saturday that Cuba be allowed to field two major-league
baseball teams and be given a share of the financial action when
players leave their homeland to join clubs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not send them to you, you took them,'' Castro told
visiting American newspaper editors. ``When you have to compete for
a player getting $6 million with our 3,000 to 4,000 pesos a year,
it presents a great deal of difficulty.'' (The exchange rate is
about 23 Cuban pesos to the U.S. dollar.)
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers who fled Cuba have played key roles for the winners of
each of the past two World Series _ Orlando Fernandez of the New
York Yankees this year and his half-brother, Levan, for the Florida
Marlins last year.
</P>
<P>
   Castro suggested a U.S.-Cuban agreement on providing players and
alluded to training centers American baseball had set up in the
Dominican Republic and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Canada has teams in major-league baseball, Castro
said, ``I believe we can send you teams to compete with (Atlanta
Braves owner Ted) Turner and the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro entertained, cajoled, humored and berated some 30 leaders
of the American Society of Newspaper Editors in a five hour,
37-minute ``conversation'' at the Convention Palace.
</P>
<P>
   The session, which came during a fact-gathering mission by the
editors, was not remarkable for the length of time he spent with a
foreign delegation, but quite unusual in time spent with American
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-year-old Castro made no major news and answered only 15
questions, the longest response lasting 55 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In the conference with the board of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors, the Cuban communist leader also:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Expressed anger over an article in Forbes magazine saying he
had amassed a personal fortune of $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been a minister or leader of the Revolution who
has gotten a dollar out of the state,'' he said. ``Not a single
person has a bank account in dollars. What right does Forbes have
to write this slander?''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Compared President Clinton to socialist Karl Marx. ``Clinton
dreams of a middle class. Other than Marx, he's the only person who
has endorsed a single strata'' of society.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Was asked about Texas Gov. George W. Bush, whom he described
as ``very young,'' ``high-rated in the United States'' and a
``leading candidate for president in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he hoped Bush's children would one day see the
resumption of trade and diplomatic relations between the United
States and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Denied that he held in prison dissenters who had ``shown
disrespect'' for his regime. But he admitted that Cuba law
sanctions persons for ``counterrevolutionary activities, working
for the U.S. government and receiving instructions from the U.S.
government.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Defended his government against criticism that it had taxed
heavily _ up to $1,000 per month _ emerging small businesses,
including restaurants limited by law to 14 patrons at one time. Yet
he conveyed unease with the expansion of the private sector in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you so interested in helping business?'' he challenged
a questioner. ``What about the crippled, the disabled?''
</P>
<P>
   He said many business people make 20 to 30 times more than
doctors and teachers despite ``less socially important positions,''
and the pay disparity was causing ``social unrest.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Justified the construction of luxurious new resort hotels an
hour's drive east of Havana amid the growing deterioration of homes
and other buildings in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't build hotels,'' he said, where would Cuba get
foreign currency to rebuild the rag-tag colonial capital? ``These
buildings (in Havana) make me so sad. But our source of currency
and employment is tourism, so what can we do?''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Accused the United States of duplicity in dealing with Cuba
and other undeveloped nations.
</P>
<P>
   He said 85 percent of Cuban exiles in the United States were not
exiles at all but ``economic refugees.'' The United States accepts
Cuban refugees immediately, Castro said, while it builds ``on the
border of Mexico the biggest wall ever _ larger than the great wall
of China _ more than 3,000 miles long'' to block Mexican
immigrants. ``Many people are dying in the desert.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rejected any plans to retire as ruler of the nation he took
over in 1959. Castro, the world's longest-reigning head of state,
said he would not retire even as a condition of lifting the
economic embargo against Cuba by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does one have a right to retire in the midst of such a
struggle? I have a sense of duty. As long as I have the necessary
physical and mental energy, as long as I can be of use, I will not
retire.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Castro's first appearance before representatives of the
editors association since April 17, 1959. None of the 30 editors at
the Havana interview had attended the 1959 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a new generation of editors, and I am the same,'' he
said jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   Castro, clad in his traditional green fatigues, walked stiffly
but appeared vigorous and in good health. His endurance seemed to
outlast many of the editors, who after four hours indicated a need
for a restroom break. Castro called this a ``technical stoppage.''
He was flanked by several key Cuban leaders, thought to be among
possible successors if Castro's brother Raoul does not take Fidel's
place. They were Roberto Robaina, foreign minister: Ricardo
Alarcon, president of the National Assembly, and Carlos Lage
Davila, secretary of the Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by the editors to open Cuba to news bureaus of American
newspapers, Castro launched into a desk-pounding criticism of
Western journalism.
</P>
<P>
   He denounced tabloids and pornography, the failure of the press
to focus on the ``serious, sincere'' analysis in his speeches, and
the consolidation of the American media under ownership of large
corporations.

   ATLANTA _ Republican Guy Millner and Democrat Roy Barnes have
shattered the previous campaign spending record for a Georgia
governor's race, shelling out a combined $24 million through
October 19.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Millner and Gov. Zell Miller spent a total of
$11.1 million in their entire race.
</P>
<P>
   Millner, who narrowly lost in 1994 after investing $1.6 million
of his own money, has already loaned his current campaign $11.6
million. He'd raised a total of $15.1 million by Oct. 19, while
Barnes reported raising $9.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a record for Georgia, but there are many campaigns
that have spent even more,'' said Larry Sabato, a political
scientist at the University of Virginia. ``This is becoming the
norm.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Millner's personal investment of nearly $20 million
over three campaigns _ two for governor, one for the U.S. Senate _
puts him in an elite group of political big spenders that includes
Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and Michael Huffington of
California.
</P>
<P>
   Millner, co-founder of Norrell Corp., said using his own money
in the campaign helps balance Barnes' political connections forged
over two decades in the state legislature that have been a rich
source Democratic campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's helpful when a candidate goes in with no
obligations, no special interests groups that they're obligated to,
no one that can come to you and say 'we gave you this and we're
expecting this,''' Millner said Monday as he campaigned with
publishing magnate Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who has brought his own wealth to bear on his
presidential campaigns, said Millner's decision to kick his own
money into the contest is refreshing to a cynical electorate.
``Voters today are looking for people who haven't sold out,''
Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his personal loans, Millner has also raised $3.5
million from about 4,400 contributors in the governor's race. In
the most recent 11-week period, Miller added $6.9 million in his
own money to $1.3 million from contributors to swamp Barnes'
aggressive fundraising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, a state representative from Cobb County, raised $4.1
million in the recent period. He did not add to the $851,000 he had
loaned or contributed to his campaign previously. About 9,000
people have contributed to Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   Millner spent $8.2 million in the recent period, while Barnes
spent $3.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the entire 1994 gubernatorial campaign, Millner spent $4.8
million to Miller's $6.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see this amount of money going into one contest, it
hurts the candidates running for other offices,'' Charles Bullock,
a political scientist at the University of Georgia, said of races
like attorney general and secretary of state. ``It sucks up
everything out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the lieutenant governor's race between state Sen.
Mark Taylor (D-Albany) and Republican Mitch Skandalakis has been
one of the most expensive down-ballot races in state history.
Taylor had a decided edge.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor had raised $4.2 million through Oct. 19, compared with
$2.1 million for Skandalakis, the chairman of the Fulton County
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent 11-week period, Taylor raised $1.1 million,
including a $41,145 personal loan, while Skandalakis raised
$709,721, including $200,000 in loans from his wife, Kay
Skandalakis.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor outspent Skandalakis $914,837 to $663,946 in the period
and had much more cash on hand: $1.1 million to $63,969.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates in both races spent the majority of the campaign
funds for television advertising, which has often been sharply
critical of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Sabato and Bullock agreed that total spending in Georgia's
gubernatorial race could wind up approaching $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates like Millner who spend many millions of their own
money on campaigns don't always win, Sabato said, but they
typically make races highly competitive. He noted that Michael
Huffington lost his 1994 bid for the U.S. Senate in California in
spite of spending more than $20 million of his fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller has spent huge personal sums on a series of races
for governor and U.S. Senate in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   When Rockefeller ran unsuccessfully for governor of West
Virginia in 1972, his opponent, Republican Arch Moore, produced a
bumper that read, ``Make him spend it all, Arch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Barnes campaign has borrowed that idea with their own
sticker: ``Make him spend it all, Roy.''

 &HT;    NBC taps Sassa to lead entertainment division
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Scott Sassa, whose career at Turner Broadcasting
System Inc. in the '90s set the stage for him to become one of most
sought-after media executives, has been named president of NBC's
entertainment division.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, the 39-year-old executive has been overseeing the
operation of the NBC's 13 owned TV stations.
</P>
<P>
   Now he will take over a division responsible for such hit shows
as ``ER'' and ``Friends,'' but which has lost the ratings pull of
such shows as ``Cheers'' and its top-rated ``Seinfeld'' comedy
series.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the change Monday, NBC said its current two top
entertainment executives, NBC Entertainment President Warren
Littlefield and his boss, NBC West Coast President Don Ohlmeyer,
will step down.
</P>
<P>
   Littlefield, entertainment president since 1991, will create a
production company with NBC to develop television shows. Ohlmeyer's
new position was not specified, although he is expected to work
with Sassa until 1999 to ensure a smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has been able to hold on to its No. 1 ranking, but also has
been losing more viewers than CBS, ABC and Fox. Analysts say
Sassa's background in programming makes him a good choice for the
top entertainment job.
</P>
<P>
   At Turner, he was head of the company's entertainment group, a
position he held since 1990. The division's best-known properties
are cable TV channels TNT, TBS, the Cartoon Network and Turner
Classic Movies. The entertainment group is separate from Turner
Broadcasting's news division, which includes CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Brimming with ideas, funny and down-to-earth, Sassa had won the
trust of Ted Turner. He served as one of Turner's closest advisers
in the chairman's move into Hollywood. His previous jobs at Turner,
where he was also a director, included executive vice president of
cable network and director of sales promotion for TBS ad sales.
</P>
<P>
   But he left in October 1996 after it became clear he would not
be named as the top executive to oversee Turner Broadcasting after
its buyout by Time Warner. Ted Turner, who became vice chairman of
Time Warner after the deal, named his second-in-command, Terence
McGuirk, to head Turner Broadcasting's day-to-day operations in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   While at Turner and even after leaving the company, Sassa
reportedly had been courted by Hollywood, including Sony Pictures
and Disney. He signed up to lead Ronald Perelman's effort to make
TV shows and movies based on characters from Marvel comics such as
Spiderman and the Incredible Hulk.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining NBC in 1997 as president of its TV stations, Sassa
has been involved in the network's transition to digital TV.
</P>

<P>
   That Guinness list of memorable movie lines has been criticized,
clobbered, dissed and deconstructed. Suggestions from Personals
readers, vetted by movie maven  &UR; Dana &LR;   &UR; Rodriguez &LR;  and arranged by
subject matter, begin with tough guys:
</P>
<P>
   ``Make my day,'' as uttered by  &UR; Clint Eastwood &LR;  in ``Dirty
Harry,'' cited by almost everyone who wrote. ``I could have been a
contender,''  &UR; Marlon Brando  &LR; in ``On the Waterfront''; ``Badges,
what badges? I don't gotta show you any stinking badges,''
 &UR; Alfonso Bedoya &LR;  from ``The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,'' recalled
by  &UR; Paul Glusman &LR; . ``Make them an offer they can't refuse,'' from
``The Godfather.'' ``Round up the usual suspects,'' said by  &UR; Claude
Rains &LR; ; &UR;  &LR; or ``Here's looking at you, kid,'' said by  &UR; Humphrey
Bogart &LR;  in ``Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading ladies:
</P>
<P>
   ``Just whistle, &LR; ''; ``You know how to whistle, Steve. Just put
your lips together and blow,'' said by  &UR; Lauren Bacall &LR;  in ``To Have
and Have Not.'' ``I don't think we're in Kansas anymore'' and
``There's no place like home,''  &UR; Judy Garland &LR;  in ``The Wizard of
Oz.'' ``I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille,'' said by
 &UR; Gloria Swanson &LR;  in ``Sunset Boulevard, &LR; '' and remembered by
 &UR; Kenneth Harlan &LR; . ``Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy
night,''  &UR; Bette Davis  &LR; in ``All About Eve,'' recalled by
 &UR; Harry Stern &LR; . ``I want to be alone,'' said by  &UR; Greta Garbo &LR;  in
``Grand Hotel''; ``Love is never having to say you're sorry,'' said
by  &UR; Ali MacGraw &LR;  in ``Love Story, &LR; '' and submitted reluctantly by
 &UR; Anni Long &LR; ,  &UR; Jarion Monroe &LR; ,  &UR; Robert Sicular &LR;  and
 &UR; Christopher Upham &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Guys in need of mellowing:
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's Johnny,'' said by  &UR; Jack Nicholson &LR;  in ``The Shining,''
recalled by  &UR; G. Shaver Jr. &LR;  ``Show me the money,'' said by  &UR; Cuba
Gooding Jr. &LR;  in ``Jerry Maguire,'' recalled by  &UR; Jean &LR; 
 &UR; Weiss &LR; . ``Top of the world, Ma!'' said by  &UR; James Cagney  &LR; in ``White
Heat''; ``Rosebud,'' said by  &UR; Orson Welles  &LR; in ``Citizen Kane,''
suggested by  &UR; Jim Peeples &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Science fiction:
</P>
<P>
   ``May the force be with you,'' attributed to ``Star Wars'' and
``Cocoon''; ``E.T. phone home,'' from ``E.T.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there were several lines not quite so familiar that had
surprising resonance with readers: ``Plastics,'' said to
 &UR; Dustin Hoffman  &LR; in ``The Graduate,'' recalled by  &UR; Robert Seiden &LR; .
``What hump?'' said by  &UR; Marty Feldman  &LR; in ``Young Frankenstein.''
``You're not very smart, are you? I like that in a man,'' said by
 &UR; Kathleen Turner &LR;  in ``Body Heat.''

</P>
<P>
   - Scented fabric, invented in Asia and already sold in France,
is making its debut in England, reports the Times of London, but
won't be marketed in America. The problem, says the British
newspaper, is that purveyors of goods made with the fabrics are
afraid of lawsuits from people allergic to various smells.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, fabrics already have been scented with the aromas of
pizza, coffee and cola. A British maker of clothes for young people
is selling a line of leisure wear smelling like lavender or
eucalyptus. The French designer  &UR; Olivier Lapidus &LR; ' fall collection,
called Perfume, includes evening dresses scented with vanilla and
rose.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is said to involve baking the fragrance into the
fabric. The aroma wafts forth when the fabric is scratched,
crumpled or rubs against the body.
</P>
<P>
   - Country Life magazine, which is published in England, says
that deer can be dissuaded from entering gardens by the liberal
spreading of tiger dung. Is this a fund-raising idea for the San
Francisco Zoo?
</P>
<P>
   - If you feel yourself about to burst into tears, says
Mademoiselle magazine, and you don't want to cry, ``squeeze your
thumb and forefinger as close together as possible, without
touching, so that they almost form the letter `O.' '' This is
supposed to take your brain away from the verge of the waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   - Attitude Adjustment, a line of ``anti-aromatherapy'' lotions
described in Men's Journal, includes Jilted, which smells like gin
and tonic. The smells are supposed to be those of comfort food, to
soothe gentlemen in the following states: Crabby, which smells like
mint chocolate; Depleted, ginger ale; Fed Up, sugar cookies; Manic,
cinnamon toast; and Piqued, grapefruit tea.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Women and men can meet anywhere. There's this thing in &LR; 
 &UR; America called dates, right? We don't have those in Iceland. &LR; 
 &UR; People just listen to music, get drunk and (do it).'' &LR;

 &HT;    BankAmerica retains Bessant
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers

<TEXT>
<P>
   Another veteran of the old NationsBank, Catherine P. Bessant,
38, has been named to a top spot in the new BankAmerica. She will
be president of the community development banking group, a job
similar to the one she held at NationsBank.
</P>
<P>
   Her West Coast counterpart and 40-year veteran of the old
BankAmerica, Donald A. Mullane, 60, an executive vice president,
will leave the organization effective Dec. 31. The banking company
said Monday that Mullane had not announced immediate plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that NationsBank senior management has the upper
hand in the merger, and this is just one more instance of that,''
said Michael Ancell with Edward Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ancell was referring to the parceling of a majority of senior
positions to NationsBank executives over the spring and summer and
to the abrupt departure last week of President David Coulter. He
had held the top job at the old BankAmerica and was the designated
successor to Chief Executive Officer Hugh L. McColl Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Bessant will report to consumer and commercial banking head
Kenneth D. Lewis. She will oversee the company's 10-year commitment
to provide $350 billion for community lending and development.

 &HT;    Pepsi's innovation invigorates soft drink industry
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The buzz surrounding Pepsi One is reigniting consumer
interest in all soft drinks, which should benefit the entire
industry, the head of Pepsi's domestic beverage operations says.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Marineau told executives meeting here from InterBev, a
global beverage convention, that Pepsi's new one-calorie drink is
generating the kind of excitement needed to keep the industry from
going flat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, people are talking about soft drinks again,'' Marineau
said. ''Consumers are running out, buying colas and doing their own
taste tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi One, which hit the market nationwide about 10 days ago, is
the first beverage in the United States featuring a blend of the
sweeteners aspartame and Ace-K, which was just recently approved by
the Food and Drug Administration for use in soft drinks. The blend
is said to give Pepsi One a true Pepsi taste without an aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi One has been called the first true innovation in the
stagnant diet sector since the 1982 introduction of Diet Coke.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I'm not going to stand up here and tell you that Pepsi One
is a guaranteed, runaway success,'' Marineau said. ''In the end,
consumers will make the ultimate decision. We'll probably know in
about six months if this is going to be the hit I think it will.''
</P>
<P>
   Marineau's six-month target, however, was viewed with skepticism
by the head of the world's largest soft drink bottler,
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ''Six months is a pretty short time frame in which to declare
victory or defeat,'' said CCE Chief Executive Henry Schimberg, who
said Pepsi One won't necessarily pull market share from Diet Coke.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, Pepsi has offered some European markets
regular Pepsi, Diet Pepsi and an aspartame and Ace-K sweetened
drink called Pepsi Max, which has a taste similar to Pepsi One.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look at what's happened in Europe, Pepsi has three
colas generating the same volume and share as they had prior to the
introduction of Pepsi Max,'' Schimberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Another topic being discussed among InterBev's 13,000 attendees
is consolidation in the bottling industry. Pepsico plans to spin
off its company-owned bottler operations into a separate company.
Coca-Cola Co. did the same thing in creating CCE in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Schimberg said such a spinoff by Pepsi could eliminate retail
price wars, resulting in better profits for both rivals. The prices
bottlers charge retailers have been mostly unchanged for the past
18 months. ''You're going to have to see some pricing
improvements,'' Schimberg said. ''It will enhance profitability _
theirs as well as ours.''
</P>
<P>
   CCE also has been fueling the consolidation trend. In 1985,
there were 278 U.S. Coca-Cola bottlers, compared with roughly 100
this year, said Marion B Glover, an Atlanta-based investment banker
specializing in the bottling industry. Glover predicts that by the
year 2000, there will be only 89 U.S. Coca-Cola bottlers, with CCE
accounting for most of the volume.
</P>
<P>
   CCE now accounts for at least 70 percent of Coca-Cola's U.S.
volume.
</P>
<P>
   CCE on Monday announced its seventh acquisition in a week, a
$110 million mostly stock deal to buy the Coca-Cola Dr Pepper
Bottling Co. of Albuquerque, N.M. The Albuquerque company, which
has operating revenue of about $54 million. Last week, CCE said it
will buy six independent bottlers for $770 million. Among those
companies was the nation's 10th-largest bottler, Cameron Coca-Cola
Bottling Co., which has operations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation has been slower for Pepsi, which had 180 U.S.
bottlers in 1987, and today has 118, Glover said.
</P>
<P>
   Also at InterBev, the late Roberto C. Goizueta was inducted into
the Soft Drink Hall of Fame. M. Douglas Ivester, who took over as
chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Co. following
Goizueta's death in October 1997, accepted the award in behalf of
Goizueta's family and the company, where the Cuban-born soft drink
legend worked for 43 years.

 &HT;    Castro asks for cut of baseball profit
 &HT;    By Rich Oppel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Noting the success of Cuban players, Fidel Castro
proposed Saturday that Cuba be allowed to field two major-league
baseball teams and be given a share of the financial action when
players leave their homeland to join clubs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not send them to you, you took them,'' Castro told
visiting American newspaper editors. ``When you have to compete for
a player getting $6 million with our 3,000 to 4,000 pesos a year,
it presents a great deal of difficulty.'' (The exchange rate is
about 23 Cuban pesos to the U.S. dollar.)
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers who fled Cuba have played key roles for the winners of
each of the past two World Series _ Orlando Fernandez of the New
York Yankees this year and his half-brother, Levan, for the Florida
Marlins last year.
</P>
<P>
   Castro suggested a U.S.-Cuban agreement on providing players and
alluded to training centers American baseball had set up in the
Dominican Republic and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Canada has teams in major-league baseball, Castro
said, ``I believe we can send you teams to compete with (Atlanta
Braves owner Ted) Turner and the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro entertained, cajoled, humored and berated some 30 leaders
of the American Society of Newspaper Editors in a five hour,
37-minute ``conversation'' at the Convention Palace.
</P>
<P>
   The session, which came during a fact-gathering mission by the
editors, was not remarkable for the length of time he spent with a
foreign delegation, but quite unusual in time spent with American
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-year-old Castro made no major news and answered only 15
questions, the longest response lasting 55 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In the conference with the board of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors, the Cuban communist leader also:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Expressed anger over an article in Forbes magazine saying he
had amassed a personal fortune of $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been a minister or leader of the Revolution who
has gotten a dollar out of the state,'' he said. ``Not a single
person has a bank account in dollars. What right does Forbes have
to write this slander?''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Compared President Clinton to socialist Karl Marx. ``Clinton
dreams of a middle class. Other than Marx, he's the only person who
has endorsed a single strata'' of society.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Was asked about Texas Gov. George W. Bush, whom he described
as ``very young,'' ``high-rated in the United States'' and a
``leading candidate for president in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he hoped Bush's children would one day see the
resumption of trade and diplomatic relations between the United
States and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Denied that he held in prison dissenters who had ``shown
disrespect'' for his regime. But he admitted that Cuba law
sanctions persons for ``counterrevolutionary activities, working
for the U.S. government and receiving instructions from the U.S.
government.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Defended his government against criticism that it had taxed
heavily _ up to $1,000 per month _ emerging small businesses,
including restaurants limited by law to 14 patrons at one time. Yet
he conveyed unease with the expansion of the private sector in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you so interested in helping business?'' he challenged
a questioner. ``What about the crippled, the disabled?''
</P>
<P>
   He said many business people make 20 to 30 times more than
doctors and teachers despite ``less socially important positions,''
and the pay disparity was causing ``social unrest.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Justified the construction of luxurious new resort hotels an
hour's drive east of Havana amid the growing deterioration of homes
and other buildings in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't build hotels,'' he said, where would Cuba get
foreign currency to rebuild the rag-tag colonial capital? ``These
buildings (in Havana) make me so sad. But our source of currency
and employment is tourism, so what can we do?''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Accused the United States of duplicity in dealing with Cuba
and other undeveloped nations.
</P>
<P>
   He said 85 percent of Cuban exiles in the United States were not
exiles at all but ``economic refugees.'' The United States accepts
Cuban refugees immediately, Castro said, while it builds ``on the
border of Mexico the biggest wall ever _ larger than the great wall
of China _ more than 3,000 miles long'' to block Mexican
immigrants. ``Many people are dying in the desert.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rejected any plans to retire as ruler of the nation he took
over in 1959. Castro, the world's longest-reigning head of state,
said he would not retire even as a condition of lifting the
economic embargo against Cuba by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does one have a right to retire in the midst of such a
struggle? I have a sense of duty. As long as I have the necessary
physical and mental energy, as long as I can be of use, I will not
retire.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Castro's first appearance before representatives of the
editors association since April 17, 1959. None of the 30 editors at
the Havana interview had attended the 1959 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a new generation of editors, and I am the same,'' he
said jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   Castro, clad in his traditional green fatigues, walked stiffly
but appeared vigorous and in good health. His endurance seemed to
outlast many of the editors, who after four hours indicated a need
for a restroom break. Castro called this a ``technical stoppage.''
He was flanked by several key Cuban leaders, thought to be among
possible successors if Castro's brother Raoul does not take Fidel's
place. They were Roberto Robaina, foreign minister: Ricardo
Alarcon, president of the National Assembly, and Carlos Lage
Davila, secretary of the Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by the editors to open Cuba to news bureaus of American
newspapers, Castro launched into a desk-pounding criticism of
Western journalism.
</P>
<P>
   He denounced tabloids and pornography, the failure of the press
to focus on the ``serious, sincere'' analysis in his speeches, and
the consolidation of the American media under ownership of large
corporations.

<P>
   That Guinness list of memorable movie lines has been criticized,
clobbered, dissed and deconstructed. Suggestions from Personals
readers, vetted by movie maven  &UR; Dana &LR;   &UR; Rodriguez &LR;  and arranged by
subject matter, begin with tough guys:
</P>
<P>
   ``Make my day,'' as uttered by  &UR; Clint Eastwood &LR;  in ``Dirty
Harry,'' cited by almost everyone who wrote. ``I could have been a
contender,''  &UR; Marlon Brando  &LR; in ``On the Waterfront''; ``Badges,
what badges? I don't gotta show you any stinking badges,''
 &UR; Alfonso Bedoya &LR;  from ``The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,'' recalled
by  &UR; Paul Glusman &LR; . ``Make them an offer they can't refuse,'' from
``The Godfather.'' ``Round up the usual suspects,'' said by  &UR; Claude
Rains &LR; ; &UR;  &LR; or ``Here's looking at you, kid,'' said by  &UR; Humphrey
Bogart &LR;  in ``Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading ladies:
</P>
<P>
   ``Just whistle, &LR; ''; ``You know how to whistle, Steve. Just put
your lips together and blow,'' said by  &UR; Lauren Bacall &LR;  in ``To Have
and Have Not.'' ``I don't think we're in Kansas anymore'' and
``There's no place like home,''  &UR; Judy Garland &LR;  in ``The Wizard of
Oz.'' ``I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille,'' said by
 &UR; Gloria Swanson &LR;  in ``Sunset Boulevard, &LR; '' and remembered by
 &UR; Kenneth Harlan &LR; . ``Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy
night,''  &UR; Bette Davis  &LR; in ``All About Eve,'' recalled by
 &UR; Harry Stern &LR; . ``I want to be alone,'' said by  &UR; Greta Garbo &LR;  in
``Grand Hotel''; ``Love is never having to say you're sorry,'' said
by  &UR; Ali MacGraw &LR;  in ``Love Story, &LR; '' and submitted reluctantly by
 &UR; Anni Long &LR; ,  &UR; Jarion Monroe &LR; ,  &UR; Robert Sicular &LR;  and
 &UR; Christopher Upham &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Guys in need of mellowing:
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's Johnny,'' said by  &UR; Jack Nicholson &LR;  in ``The Shining,''
recalled by  &UR; G. Shaver Jr. &LR;  ``Show me the money,'' said by  &UR; Cuba
Gooding Jr. &LR;  in ``Jerry Maguire,'' recalled by  &UR; Jean &LR; 
 &UR; Weiss &LR; . ``Top of the world, Ma!'' said by  &UR; James Cagney  &LR; in ``White
Heat''; ``Rosebud,'' said by  &UR; Orson Welles  &LR; in ``Citizen Kane,''
suggested by  &UR; Jim Peeples &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Science fiction:
</P>
<P>
   ``May the force be with you,'' attributed to ``Star Wars'' and
``Cocoon''; ``E.T. phone home,'' from ``E.T.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there were several lines not quite so familiar that had
surprising resonance with readers: ``Plastics,'' said to
 &UR; Dustin Hoffman  &LR; in ``The Graduate,'' recalled by  &UR; Robert Seiden &LR; .
``What hump?'' said by  &UR; Marty Feldman  &LR; in ``Young Frankenstein.''
``You're not very smart, are you? I like that in a man,'' said by
 &UR; Kathleen Turner &LR;  in ``Body Heat.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; EYES AND NOSE BUT NOT THROAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Scented fabric, invented in Asia and already sold in France,
is making its debut in England, reports the Times of London, but
won't be marketed in America. The problem, says the British
newspaper, is that purveyors of goods made with the fabrics are
afraid of lawsuits from people allergic to various smells.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, fabrics already have been scented with the aromas of
pizza, coffee and cola. A British maker of clothes for young people
is selling a line of leisure wear smelling like lavender or
eucalyptus. The French designer  &UR; Olivier Lapidus &LR; ' fall collection,
called Perfume, includes evening dresses scented with vanilla and
rose.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is said to involve baking the fragrance into the
fabric. The aroma wafts forth when the fabric is scratched,
crumpled or rubs against the body.
</P>
<P>
   - Country Life magazine, which is published in England, says
that deer can be dissuaded from entering gardens by the liberal
spreading of tiger dung. Is this a fund-raising idea for the San
Francisco Zoo?
</P>
<P>
   - If you feel yourself about to burst into tears, says
Mademoiselle magazine, and you don't want to cry, ``squeeze your
thumb and forefinger as close together as possible, without
touching, so that they almost form the letter `O.' '' This is
supposed to take your brain away from the verge of the waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   - Attitude Adjustment, a line of ``anti-aromatherapy'' lotions
described in Men's Journal, includes Jilted, which smells like gin
and tonic. The smells are supposed to be those of comfort food, to
soothe gentlemen in the following states: Crabby, which smells like
mint chocolate; Depleted, ginger ale; Fed Up, sugar cookies; Manic,
cinnamon toast; and Piqued, grapefruit tea.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Women and men can meet anywhere. There's this thing in &LR; 
 &UR; America called dates, right? We don't have those in Iceland. &LR; 
 &UR; People just listen to music, get drunk and (do it).'' &LR;

COMPUTER GLITCH HALTS WALL STREET TRADING

(JT) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A computer glitch forced the New York Stock Exchange
to halt trading for nearly an hour Monday afternoon, setting off a
cascade of trading interruptions at stock and futures exchanges
across the country that list products linked to the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   Trading of the popular Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks was
immediately halted on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The Chicago
Board Options Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Pacific
Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange halted trading
of options on Big Board-listed stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Stock Exchange, the Pacific and the Philadelphia
exchanges also halted trading in Big Board stocks, as did private
exchanges like Madoff Securities that deal mostly with small
investors. Institutional investors continued trading on the
Instinet, an electronic exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown was the Big Board's first major technology failure
since an unrelated electronic communications problem delayed the
opening of the exchange for an hour on Dec. 17, 1995. Exactly one
year ago, trading was halted because stocks had plunged 554 points
during the session, the maximum allowed under trading rules at the
time, but that delay did not involve any technical failure.
</P>
<P>
   Traders were surprised and uneasy during the pause, but the
interruption came on a slow trading day and there was no sense of
panic. Many calmly engaged in paperwork or calls to clients.
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., the nation's largest discount broker, posted
an online message to clients trading at its Internet site telling
individual investors that their orders would be held in a queue for
execution when trading resumed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was much like taking overnight orders for execution in the
mornings,'' said Thomas Taggart, a spokesman for Schwab.
``Investors didn't know how many were ahead of them in the queue
and couldn't be sure of where the market would be when they were
filled.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange said the disruption was caused by a malfunction in
one of a group of eight switches that transmit orders from brokers
and traders to the computer system that manages trading. The faulty
switch began generating inaccurate and duplicate information,
essentially ``hogging the highway,'' said Robert Britz, the Big
Board's executive vice president who oversees technology.
</P>
<P>
   The malfunction may have ended up as more of an embarrassment
than a disaster for the exchange. It has spent more than $1 billion
on new technology in the past decade to immunize trading from such
glitches. But because Monday was such a slow trading day it is not
clear that this malfunction had much business impact.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the breakdown was a black eye for the Big Board in a era
when exchanges increasingly rely on their technical prowess to
compete. The faulty switch prevented traders from getting current
prices and from executing orders for 2,500 of the 3,090 stocks
listed on the exchange for more than an hour. The problem began at
12:37, Britz said, but it took about 45 minutes to isolate it and
determine that trading should be halted to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   The problem would not have occurred had the faulty switch failed
completely, Britz said. In that case, the system would have
automatically plugged in a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Another frustration, Britz said, was that the exchange was only
weeks away from retiring the switches. Nearly 600 stocks were
unaffected before the halt because they had already been converted
to the new system, which turns the traffic control tasks handled by
the switches over to a software program.
</P>
<P>
   Other exchanges have periodically suffered similar technical
breakdowns. During one month in the summer of 1994, the Nasdaq, a
computerized over-the-counter market, suffered three separate
disruptions including on 34-minute trading halt after a squirrel
chewed through a power line and the exchange's backup system failed
to kick in.
</P>
<P>
   Britz said that the Big Board has several technical failures
each day but they rarely cause even the slightest blip because
backup systems usually function perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Stock Exchange, based in San Francisco, had an even
more dismaying day. Hours before it lost business linked to the Big
Board, the Pacific exchange was shut for 30 minutes because of a
faulty fire alarm.

HOUSTON MAYOR REFUSES TO BOW TO CHRISTIAN GROUP PRESSURE TO BLOCK
SOLED-OUT MARILYN MANSON CONCERT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JULIE MASON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Mayor Lee Brown's office said Monday he will not bow
to pressure from Christian groups to block the sold-out Nov. 4
concert by shock rockers Marilyn Manson at the city-owned Bayou
Place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a number of calls and some letters,'' said Joe
Weikerth, senior executive assistant to Brown. ``Some people are
very disturbed by this particular entertainer. I personally don't
know Marilyn Manson from whomever, but apparently he is a pretty
weird guy with a pretty provocative message.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Misael Vargas of the Primera Rosa de Saron Congregation
of Houston wrote Brown asking him to cancel the concert as a
demonstration of the mayor's opposition to drugs and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas could not be reached Monday, but his letter said Manson
is a ``promoter of violence and sexual immorality'' and ``adamantly
opposes authority.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the sake of peace and well-being of Houston, we seek that
his coming concert and any future concerts be canceled,'' Vargas
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to radio station KSBJ 89.3 FM, Vargas asked that
word be spread about the impending concert and letters and faxes
mailed to Brown's office opposing it. The letter said Manson ``does
everything against the law in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Christian music radio station produced news reports
on the protest, it is not taking part or promoting the effort, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio-based Marilyn Manson is a rock group headed by the
29-year-old lead singer of the same name, born Brian Warner.
</P>
<P>
   The band is touring to promote its latest album, ``Mechanical
Animals.'' For years, the band's provocative lyrics and disturbing
imagery have attracted protests from Christian and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   According to news reports, efforts are under way to deny the
group visas to tour Australia, and protests are being organized by
Christian groups in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous U.S. cities have tried to ban the band's appearances,
with varying success. Most recently, city officials in Syracuse,
N.Y., tried to block a planned concert by threatening to withhold
permits and funding to a taxpayer-supported venue hosting the band.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials in Brown's office said the mayor supports the
band's right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we recognize that many find the performance of Mr.
Manson offensive, it would be inappropriate to violate his rights
of expression,'' said Jay Aiyer, chief of staff for the mayor.
``That's not the role of government.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: THE THREE CLINTONS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After nine days of secret meetings on the tormenting
issues of Israeli-Palestinian peace, the denouement in the East
Room of the White House had its inherent fascination. But for me
the most interesting aspect of the ceremony was what it said about
President Clinton. Three things, really.
</P>
<P>
   First, only the president of the United States could have pushed
parties so morbidly suspicious of each other through nine days of
prickly talks to agreement. And only this president.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Jimmy Carter at Camp David 20 years ago has a
president involved himself so deeply in a Middle East negotiation.
No one else had the prestige, the knowledge of the issues and the
personal commitment needed to make this negotiation work.
</P>
<P>
   That estimate of Clinton's role was a common thread in the
remarks by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Chairman Yasser
Arafat and King Hussein. Netanyahu's words were in a way
surprising, because he and Clinton have not exactly admired each
other _ not since Clinton virtually campaigned for Shimon Peres in
the 1996 Israeli election.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a warrior for peace,'' Netanyahu said of the president.
``I mean, he doesn't stop. He has this ability to maintain a
tireless pace and to nudge and prod and suggest and use a nimble
and flexible mind to truly explore the possibilities of both sides,
and never just on one side. That is a great gift, I think a
precious and unique one, and it served us well.''
</P>
<P>
   The king was even warmer _ and more poignant, given his struggle
with cancer. He had known American presidents since Eisenhower with
respect and affection, he said, but he had never known one with
Clinton's ``dedication, clearheadedness, focus and determination
... the tolerance and the patience of Job.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, the president's achievement in the Wye River negotiation
put the Monica Lewinsky affair in perspective. How trivial it
looked compared with the stakes at Wye River for Israelis and
Palestinians, and for the peace of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The admiring comments on Clinton effectively showed what foreign
statesmen think about the Lewinsky business. They think it is
frivolous compared with Clinton's duties and abilities, and they
regard our preoccupation with it as grotesque. They see the
Republican attempt to remove Clinton from office as a piece of
narrow partisanship at the expense of America's place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of some Clinton-haters to the Middle East accord
was telling. The Wall Street Journal editorial page led with
another in its dreary series on ``Clinton Scandals.'' In the
adjoining column an outside writer, Robert Satloff of the
Washington Institute for Near East Policy, appraised the Wye
accomplishment as substantial; the editors put a headline on his
piece that made it sound critical.
</P>
<P>
   But those who are more dispassionate about Bill Clinton could
also see, in the East Room ceremony, reason for disappointment in
him. That was the third response the occasion evoked.
</P>
<P>
   We saw in the East Room a president at the top of his form,
intelligent, at ease, the master of his brief. And we saw a
politician who cared so much about this negotiation that he put off
campaign plans for an election two weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   What might have been if Bill Clinton had had that kind of
commitment on other things over the last six years _ if he had not
so often waffled on issues and abandoned friends. He had
exceptional leadership qualities. He understood that Americans
wanted pragmatic solutions, not ideology. But again and again he
did not seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   The area that troubles me the most is civil liberties. Clinton's
years in office will be remembered for the destruction of federal
habeas corpus, the stripping away of judicial protection of
immigrants from official cruelty and other losses to liberty. A
president who once taught constitutional law did not raise his
voice in objection.
</P>
<P>
   It is only fair to add that this president has been under the
most sustained, vicious, bountifully financed attack of any
president in decades. He survived, and I believe he will survive
the impeachment effort. Certainly his performance at Wye River
disposes of the argument that because of the Lewinsky affair he
cannot be an effective president. He can, when he cares.

HURRICANES EXPOSE THIN INSURANCE COVERAGE OF PUERTO RICO
HOMEOWNERS
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ In many ways, the capital of Puerto Rico
does not look strikingly different from cities in the 50 states
like Miami, Houston and parts of New York. There are plenty of
modern new office buildings, condominiums and fast-food places.
And, just as in those other cities, Puerto Rico has lots of modest
neighborhoods, away from the modern facades, with people who are
just getting by.
</P>
<P>
   But Hurricane Georges, which hit the island last month and
caused several billion dollars in damages, has brought out one big
difference: while nearly every home in the 50 states is insured,
insurance executives and government officials estimate that only 30
percent or 40 percent of those here are covered.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that much of the cost of Hurricane Georges in
Puerto Rico will not be shouldered by insurance companies. Instead,
it will be borne mostly by the people of the island and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency in Washington, using tax dollars
collected everywhere but here, because under Puerto Rico's special
commonwealth status, its people do not pay Federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a different kind of insurance here,'' said Lemuel
Toledo, a broker and consultant who has been in the insurance
business for nearly 30 years. ``It's called Federal aid.''
</P>
<P>
   While mainland insurers are expected to spend six times what the
federal government does for damage from Hurricane Georges in the
Gulf Coast states, the government will spend just as much in Puerto
Rico as the insurers do: about $1.7 billion each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, every time a storm hits an area that is
uninsured, or underinsured, taxpayers have to come in and foot much
of the bill,'' said Steven Goldstein, a spokesman for the Insurance
Information Institute, an industry group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   And something else is increasing federal costs from hurricanes
both here and along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Insurers, reeling
from heavy losses from previous hurricanes, have raised their
deductibles to 2 percent of the amount of coverage, up from the old
standards of $250 or $500. For a $100,000 policy the deductible is
now $2,000. One condo complex on the beach here with $25 million in
coverage has a deductible of $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency says that people with
big deductibles who need emergency repairs to live in their homes
can get government help, and that many homeowners and condo
associations may be eligible for federally subsidized loans.
</P>
<P>
   The reason many people in Puerto Rico do not have insurance on
their homes, officials and insurers here say, is mostly a matter of
money. While there are plenty of expensive houses and limousines on
the island, most people have little money. Annual income averages
$8,500, less than half the average in Mississippi, the poorest
state. But in Mississippi, the majority of homeowners has mortgages
and is required by banks to buy insurance. Here, people often build
modest homes without mortgages _ sometimes worth less than $20,000,
and they frequently go without insurance. Moreover, when people
here buy insurance they most often buy bare-bones policies that do
not cover furniture or theft.
</P>
<P>
   But other reasons also account for the difference. Not only do
most poorer Puerto Ricans count on federal aid to bail them out of
disasters, they are also victims, consumer advocates say, of
insurers here who essentially ignore lower-income homeowners to
concentrate on wealthier clients whose homes are sturdier and who
buy policies with higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   That practice, they say, is a form of discrimination often
referred to as redlining, a term that grew out of the practice _
now outlawed _ by insurance companies and banks in places like
Philadelphia, Detroit and New York of drawing red lines on maps
around neighborhoods they decided to exclude.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the poor neighborhoods on the outskirts of San Juan,
people say insurance salesmen never come calling. Residents say
they do not really understand insurance and they assume they cannot
afford it.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Toa Baja, Tanya Davila sat in a kitchen chair in
the shade of her concrete-and-wood three-bedroom house, waiting for
a representative of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Hurricane Georges ripped off most of her house's tin roofing and
most of her belongings were ruined. The house, Ms. Davila said, is
worth about $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurred to me to buy insurance,'' she said. ``Nobody
ever came to talk to us about insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davila, 42, said she did not know anyone who had homeowner's
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't buy disaster insurance because they know the
government is going to take care of them,'' she said. ```If I can
get something for free, why pay for it?' That's not my opinion. But
that's the way a lot of people think.''
</P>
<P>
   In a section of neatly kept homes in the nearby town of Catano,
Petra Gonzalez, 78, said she was hoping that FEMA would repair the
roof on her $25,000 wood-and-tin house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't build this house thinking the government would take
care of me if something happened,'' she said. ``I never imagined
anything like this could happen. That's the truth. I'm a poor
person. I'm an elderly person. My husband is gone. If the
government doesn't help me, there's nothing I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some insurers and brokers acknowledged that it was difficult, if
not impossible, to get insurance on the many inexpensive wooden
houses in Puerto Rico. Nor do insurers regard poor sections as
prime markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd rather deal with the upper- middle-class guy with a
$250,000 home and four cars than the guy with a $30,000 home and
one car,'' said Toledo, who now concentrates on commercial
insurance. ``It takes the same amount of time, but there is so much
more premium and so much more commission.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not redlining, Toledo contended. ``Redlining means
somebody asks for insurance and you don't sell it,'' he said. ``But
if nobody asks, you're not redlining.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Antonio Garcia, the insurance commissioner of Puerto Rico,
also sees no discrimination. ``This is a free-competition market,''
Garcia said. ``The companies are at liberty to write whatever risks
they want to write. People either buy it or they don't. I can't
force them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, J. Robert Hunter, the director of
insurance for the Consumer Federation of America, said insurers had
never publicly acknowledged redlining. Yet several big companies
have paid millions to settle suits accusing them of redlining and
agreed to open offices in places where there had been no insurance
sales force for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on in Puerto Rico has all the characteristics of
red-lining,'' said Hunter, who has made several trips here to work
as an adviser to the Puerto Rican government.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Jose J. Villamil, a Wharton-educated economist who heads a
consulting company, Estudios Tecnicos, which works with the
government and private industry, said he did not believe that
insurers were deliberately discriminating against the poor. But
Villamil said some of the remedies imposed in redlining lawsuits
should be applied in Puerto Rico anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has a role to play in terms of putting pressure
on the companies,'' he said. ``The companies should be more
pro-active in educating people about insurance and in providing
access to insurance. Maybe they should develop products more in
line with people's capacity to buy insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen companies, mostly Puerto Rican, sell insurance on
the island. Royal Group, a British insurer with more than 100 years
of experience in the Caribbean, is among the leaders. Only two big
United States companies, Nationwide Insurance Enterprise and
American International Group, sell homeowners' coverage in Puerto
Rico, though Allstate Corp. is preparing to start selling here.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of handicapping the risks on an island that lies
in the path of hurricanes and in an earthquake zone, combined with
the relatively small size of the Puerto Rico market at 3.8 million
people, have kept the other big American players away, said
Goldstein of the industry group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If insurers felt they could add to their bottom line,'' he
said, ``they'd be in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The insurance companies began imposing higher deductibles after
Hurricane Andrew walloped southern Florida with $15.5 billion in
insured losses in 1992. To get regulatory approval for the change,
insurers in the United States threatened to cut back on the number
of policies they wrote. In Puerto Rico, the insurers said that
without the 2 percent deductible, the cost of reinsurance would
force them to raise premiums beyond the reach of many.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, a former Texas insurance commissioner, said the high
deductibles ``may have been a necessary stopgap'' immediately after
Hurricane Andrew. But the insurance companies could reduce the
deductible now without harm to their profit margins, he said
adding, ``Reinsurance prices have come way down in the last two or
three years.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Hunter said, consumers should be given the choice,
as they are in some states, of accepting either the high deductible
or paying higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Jose de la Cruz Skerrett, a plaintiff's lawyer who has often
opposed insurance companies in court, estimates that with the 2
percent deductible, 80 percent of the losses from Hurricane Georges
in Puerto Rico will turn out to be uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   For some condo owners, the high deductible means significant
costs. At the 13-story Solemar condominium on the beach in San
Juan, Ivan Tort, president of the board, estimates damages at
$60,000 _ well below the $100,000 deductible on the condo's $5
million policy. So all the repairs are going to have to be paid by
owners of the condo's 30 apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you live on an island,'' Tort said, ``it comes with the
turf.''
</P>
<P>
   At the 403-apartment Condado del Mar condominium nearby, Luis
del Valle is not so sanguine. Del Valle estimates damage at $1.5
million. But he says much of the building was unharmed and that the
deductible _ now figured at $500,000 _ should not be based on the
total value of the complex but only on the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think this is fair,'' del Valle said. ``Yes, we have
a contract, but we believe there are some ambiguities. We're going
to court. We're talking about a lot of money here.'' &QL;

PRICES MIXED ON DAY OF COMPUTER GLITCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices were mixed in relatively subdued trading
Monday, a session highlighted by a computer glitch on the New York
Stock Exchange that caused a trading halt of nearly an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The halt was a result of the failure of a switch that sends
orders from the exchange to brokers' trading posts.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time trading has been delayed in nearly three
years. On Dec. 18, 1995, the start of trading on the New York Stock
Exchange was delayed for an hour because of a series of computer
glitches.
</P>
<P>
   But traders said that since Monday's trading halt took place in
the afternoon, it was potentially much more disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this had been a pretty heavy day, it could have been a big
problem,'' said one stock trader, who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange
was the lightest since Aug. 24, with just 609.9 million shares
changing hands.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks opened lower but then rose on the strength of a powerful
performance on European exchanges. Shares rallied across the
Continent after the Bank of Italy followed other central banks and
cut interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Better than expected earnings reports from a number of companies
also lifted the Dow Jones industrial average early in the day. But
it lost ground later. The blue-chip index fell 20.08 points, to
8,432.21.
</P>
<P>
   Broader market averages did better, however, and small-cap
stocks continued to rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.65 points, or
0.15 percent, to 1,072.32. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 31.12
points, or 1.84 percent, to 1,724.98. The Russell 2000 index, which
is made up of largely small-cap issues, gained 5.02 points, or 1.37
percent, to 372.07.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, which is laden with high-technology companies, got a
big boost from a report showing that in the third quarter worldwide
personal-computer shipments surged 13.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are reading these numbers and thinking that the
technology companies can grow in a slow-growth environment,'' said
Michael Molnar, a managing director in retail sales and trading at
Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer rose 4\, to 62{; Intel was up 1 11/16, to 88
15/16, and Cisco Systems gained 2 11/16, to 61 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Among Dow stocks, AT&AMP;T and American Express both posted gains
after reporting strong third-quarter earnings. AT&AMP;T rose 7/16, to
64 1/4, after the company said it earned $1 a share in the period,
better than the 95 cents most analysts had expected. American
Express shares rose 1/2, to 88 1/8, after it reported earnings that
were slightly above analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Wien, U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, said third-quarter earnings reports have been something of
a pleasant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Wien has spent the last two weeks traveling in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left, everyone was convinced earnings would be a
disaster,'' he said. ``That has not been the case.''

 &HT;    Georgia: Millner's ignorance of government starting to show
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Roy Barnes is not the first candidate to attempt to
capitalize on what Guy Millner doesn't know.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996 GOP Senate primary, Johnny Isakson tripped up
Millner with a question about presidential vetos, in much the same
way Barnes has challenged Millner's basic knowledge of how the
state runs in several debates.
</P>
<P>
   This year Millner has struggled over such questions as how many
representatives there are in the Georgia House (180) and what
percentage of the hotel-motel tax goes to counties (100). Asked
during Sunday's WSB-GPTV debate about who makes the annual budget
estimate, he gave a good try, tossing out the name of a budget
official or two, but didn't answer directly that this is one of the
governor's major duties.
</P>
<P>
   Millner argues cheerfully that he brings a different kind of
expertise to the table, and certainly there are bound to be gaps in
the knowledge of someone who hasn't served in state government.
</P>
<P>
   More troubling than what he doesn't know is what Millner won't
say.
</P>
<P>
   At various times in this campaign, Millner has declined to
answer such basic questions as whether he plans to live in the
governor's mansion, who he's thinking of for chief of staff, or how
he intends to vote on the constitutional amendment that would set
up a commission to determine the governor's salary.
</P>
<P>
   His reticence to answer such questions is part of a strategy of
sticking rigidly on message, which has worked, at least to the
extent Millner is in better shape now than he's been in either of
his previous races.
</P>
<P>
   But Millner's refusal to answer some questions he must know, and
his difficulty with some he should know, also forecasts the
leadership style Millner will bring to the office if he's elected
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Millner was known to be interested in running for governor years
before he challenged Gov. Zell Miller in 1994, and he's now in his
third statewide campaign. He's an intelligent man, which leads to
the conclusion that given ample time to do so, he simply hasn't
troubled himself to learn some of the details he's tripped on this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the person that's built a major enterprise and I can tell
you, you need smart people around you,'' the Republican businessman
said Sunday. In a similar vein, he said at the Chamber of Commerce
forum a few weeks ago that he'd be relying on his department heads
to find where to cut fat in the budget.
</P>
<P>
   To a state bureaucrat who has lived eight years under the
regimen of a Marine sergeant, a ``people person'' who doesn't worry
with details probably doesn't sound too bad. The question is
whether this approach can work in a setting where departments are
fiefdoms and the knowledge of small things is the key to power.
</P>
<P>
   A number of times during this campaign Millner has referred to
Atlanta Chamber of Commerce President Pete Correll being appointed
by Governor Miller to head up what has become the Metropolitan
Atlanta Transportation Initiative. This is only a slight inaccuracy
_ the governor was involved, but actually MATI was initiated by the
chamber itself.
</P>
<P>
   What is more notable is that over a number of weeks, either no
one has pointed this out to Millner, or he has ignored them. Or
perhaps the person who's job it will be to tell him when he's wrong
won't be designated until after the election.

 &HT;    Louisiana law against sodomy goes on trial
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Louisiana's two-century-old law barring anal and
oral sex went on trial in a civil court here Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A group of gays and lesbians, mostly attorneys, is challenging
the state's ``crimes against nature'' statute as unconstitutional.
They say it violates people's right to privacy and particularly the
rights of gays and lesbians, who are usually the targets of the
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is important to everybody because sex between consenting
adults is the essence of the right to privacy,'' said John Rawls,
the lead attorney for the plaintiffs. ``This statute takes a normal
human act and makes it a felony.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs have 31 witnesses who will testify that
homosexuality is normal and that Louisiana gays and lesbians live
in fear of police intimidation and even jail. On Monday, a
neurologist testified that a person's sexual orientation is
determined in the womb and therefore is not a choice. A
psychiatrist said homosexuality is normal by the standards of the
American Psychiatric Association.
</P>
<P>
   The state Attorney General's office plans to present just three
witnesses, including a man who claims he can cure homosexuality. In
cross-examination Monday, the state argued that just because a
person is born with certain urges doesn't mean he or she has to act
on them. And the state argued that psychiatrists do not make the
ultimate judgments on what is normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you be surprised that a 1998 poll shows that a vast
majority of Americans do not accept homosexuality as a normal
behavior?'' said Tom Halligan with the Attorney General's office.
``Society's `normal' involves not just psychiatry but morality,
philosophy, even religious beliefs, and (for the Legislature), it
involves the concern over how it places itself for posterity, and
how it preserves the traditional forms of marriage and family.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' first witness was a veterinarian who said
homosexuality has been observed in animals. While questioning him,
Rawls pointed out that the punishment for toruturing an animal to
death _ six months in jail _ is 10 times as light as the punishment
for someone who tries to have oral or anal sex with an animal _
five years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which do you think is more traumatic for the animal?'' Rawls
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, death is certainly the most traumatic thing, `` said Dr.
Michael Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1972, 31 states have abolished sodomy laws; 19 states,
including Georgia, still have them on the books. In 1995, the
Louisiana Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the sodomy law by a
man serving a five-year jail sentence for soliciting oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Georgia's sodomy law.
Since then, petitioners in several states have challenged the laws
in civil courts as unconstitutional, and they have been successful
in several states, including Kentucky, Montana and Tennessee. Two
states besides Louisiana _ Arkansas and Rhode Island, _ face
challenges to sodomy laws.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to last a week. A civil district judge
will issue a judgment after both sides have presented their
arguments.

 &HT;    Triple homicide may lead investigators to Florida
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa and Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Police investigating the killings of three men in a
downtown Atlanta hotel may soon travel to central Florida, where
two of the victims lived.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and friends of Ronald Gutkowski, 50, and Gerrold
Shropshire, 51, said Monday that Atlanta investigators have
indicated that a trip is possible. Gutkowski and Shropshire were
shot to death execution style along with a business associate,
31-year-old Phillip Dover, on the 24th floor of the Atlanta Hilton
&AMP; Towers last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Gutkowski, Ronald's widow, declined Monday to talk in
detail about what she knows of the investigation but said police
told her they might come to Florida soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were going to call me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Shropshire's pastor, the Rev. Randolph Bracy, and his wife,
LaVon, also expect Atlanta police to come to Florida. LaVon Bracy
said officials with Coggins Trucking, where both men worked, called
her recently because Atlanta police planning a trip needed a church
member's address and phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Shropshire lived in Altamonte Springs, a suburb of Orlando.
Gutkowski lived in Leesburg, a town of 15,000 people about 40 miles
away. Dover is from Gainesville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   LaVon Bracy said she and other members of Shropshire's church,
New Covenant Baptist Church, are ''baffled'' by the killing,
especially because Gutkowski and Shropshire worked hard, went to
church and stayed out of trouble. She said she was encouraged after
talking Monday morning with Alice Gutkowski.
</P>
<P>
   ''She said she felt there were some leads that the police have
not shared with the public or the media,'' Bracy said.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Gutkowski said later Monday that she ''certainly hopes''
police are making progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope somebody comes forward and I hope the police are able
to find out who did this,'' she said. ''It's been like a
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police Maj. Mickey Lloyd said he would not discuss the
case with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and that he had nothing
new to report.
</P>
<P>
   Last week police released a hotel camera videotape of Dover and
an unidentified man walking toward the hotel elevators at about 2
a.m. on Oct. 18. The victim and the stranger are seen chatting
briefly and then getting into the elevator together.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Deputy Chief C.B. Jackson has said all three men died
sometime after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police want to question the man as a ``possible
witness,'' said investigator Alvin Winston.
</P>
<P>
   Homicide detectives are also working with College Park police to
determine whether the Hilton triple slaying is related to a murder
that occurred on Oct. 15 at a Days Inn on Old National Highway. In
that case, 19-year-old Ladaris Hawkins was shot in the face after
someone entered his room at about 10:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   As in the Atlanta incident, there was no forced entry into
Hawkin's room, College Park police have said. Last week
investigators said shell casings found at both crime scenes had
come from the same caliber handgun.
</P>
<P>
   College Park Lt. Richard Chromi said he has thrown all his
manpower from the major crimes division into the case, with
detectives working ``nights and weekends to get it solved.''
</P>
<P>
   The department released and new tip line number _ 404-817-6847.
Atlanta business associations have offered a $60,000 reward for
information.

MICROSOFT ASSERTS ``SET-UP'' IN PIVOTAL MEETING BY NETSCAPE
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By STEVE LOHR and JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Opening a new line of defense in its antitrust
trial, Microsoft Corp. on Monday portrayed a meeting that is a
focal point in the government's case as a ``set up'' orchestrated
by its Internet software rival, Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft based that claim on the fact that the Justice
Department issued a civil subpoena to Netscape the day after the
meeting, on June 21, 1995, and that two days later government
lawyers received a reply from a Netscape lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft obtained the previously undisclosed letter from the
Netscape lawyer to the Justice Department only two days ago _ an
omission that Microsoft called a ``flagrant'' breach by the
government of the rules of pretrial document discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the states that are suing Microsoft
have alleged that at the June 21, 1995, meeting Microsoft made an
illegal offer to Netscape to divide the market for the browser
software used to navigate the Internet's World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   And the next day, in an e-mail message to Microsoft Chairman
Bill Gates, Dan Rosen, a Microsoft executive who had attended the
meeting, reported that much of the discussion between Microsoft and
Netscape had ``centered on how the lines would be drawn between''
what Microsoft and Netscape would market.
</P>
<P>
   In his fourth day cross-examining James Barksdale, president and
chief executive of Netscape, John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer,
asked the question that framed what he called the ``set up''
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it a fact,'' Warden declared, ``that the June 21, 1995,
meeting was held for the purpose of creating something that could
be described as a record to be given to the Justice Department to
spur them on to take action against Microsoft?''
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale replied, ``That's absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   David Boies, the Justice Department's trial counsel, said the
subpoena for information was issued to Netscape in connection with
another inquiry into Microsoft that the government was already
conducting at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Boies said Microsoft's effort to portray the June 1995 meeting
as a Netscape conspiracy suggested that Microsoft's lawyers were
straining to try to discredit a powerful allegation in the
government's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time a defendant says, `We were set up,' I think that
tells you how a trial is going,'' Boies said.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoena issued by the Justice Department the day after the
Netscape-Microsoft meeting does refer specifically to a separate
matter that the government was investigating at the time:
Microsoft's plan to bundle its online service, Microsoft Network,
or MSN, with its new operating system, Windows 95, which was
shipped two months later, in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
   That investigation had been undertaken after America Online
complained that placing a direct link to MSN from the Windows 95
desktop was an unfair leveraging of Microsoft's monopoly in
operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   (That complaint was eventually settled when Microsoft agreed to
place a link to America Online on the Windows desktop _ but only
after the online service agreed to distribute Microsoft's browser
to all its millions of members. David Colburn, a senior
vice-president of America Online, is expected to testify about that
deal later this week.)
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Justice Department took no action to prevent
Windows 95 from being shipped with a link to Microsoft Network.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the June 23, 1995, response by Gary L. Reback, then a
Netscape lawyer, to the Justice Department's subpoena for
information in the MSN investigation focused mainly on the meeting
two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Reback's four-page letter states that at the meeting, Microsoft
said it would not provide Netscape with necessary technical
information unless ``Microsoft gets an equity interest in Netscape,
a seat on Netscape's board of directors, and otherwise controls
Netscape's ability to compete against Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Reback, a partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &AMP; Rosati,
wrote that Microsoft had made it clear that if Netscape was going
to compete with Microsoft ``in any way,'' then Microsoft ``will
competitively harm Netscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Attached to Reback's letter was a copy of the notes taken at the
June 1995 meeting by Marc Andreessen, a co-founder of Netscape, in
which he described the ``threat'' by Microsoft that it planned to
``own'' the market for browsers that run on Windows 95 and that
``Netscape should stay away.''
</P>
<P>
   In its motion seeking sanctions against the Justice Department
on Monday, Microsoft said, ``The recently produced documents
demonstrate quite clearly that the June 21, 1995, meeting was a
`set up' orchestrated by Netscape's counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on Monday, Microsoft introduced documents and memos from
Netscape's files suggesting that the company had lost an important
corporate customer to Microsoft largely because of Netscape's own
failings, not because of predatory behavior by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Intuit, maker of Quicken, the popular personal-finance
software, asked Netscape to provide a customized version of
Netscape for use with Quicken. The Netscape documents suggest that
the company could not provide the new software for many months. One
slide from an internal Netscape presentation shown in court on
Monday included the heading ``We offered, but did not deliver'' the
five custom modifications to the program that Quicken had wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``While you were trying to figure things out,'' Warden said,
``Microsoft had already offered'' a customized version of its
browser.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale acknowledged that Netscape had made errors, but added,
``I don't think that was the primary reason we did not get the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft offered Intuit special inducements that Netscape could
not match, he said, including free software and special coding in
Windows that made Quicken easier to run.
</P>
<P>
   After four full days off cross examination, Warden closed the
questioning of Barksdale on Monday evening by entering into
evidence a note written in jest by several employees for display on
Netscape's internal computer network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Monday Netscape will release two or three more bug-ridden
beta versions'' of Netscape Navigator, the note began, adding that
the program ``is faster than a dog with no legs, if the dog's up to
his waist in treacle. And dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale explained, ``We allow our employees to let off steam
this way. Mostly they complain about the food in the cafeteria.''

CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS ACCUSE PARTY OFFICIALS OF WITHHOLDING
CAMPAIGN FUNDS
</HEADLINE>

(sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leading Democrats in Congress have angrily accused
officials at the White House and the Democratic National Committee
of hurting House and Senate campaigns by husbanding resources to
erase the party's debt and help Vice President Al Gore kick off his
own campaign in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional Democrats also assert that top party officials
are inadvertently discouraging party loyalists from voting, and are
dampening fund-raising efforts, by making dire predictions that the
party could lose as many as 25 House seats.
</P>
<P>
   The finance chairman of the party's Congressional Campaign
Committee, Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, was so incensed about
the party's modest stated goals that he had this advice for the
party chairman: ``Keep your money and shut up your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials on both sides of the argument say the feuding, only
one week before Election Day, is a giant distraction at a time the
party needs to stay focused on a common enemy, the Republicans, who
are in the final days of the most ambitious party-paid advertising
campaign in any non-presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   While rifts are common within both parties, the current schism
among Democrats is unusually bitter. And it comes at a time when
the usual stakes of an off-year election are even higher with the
impeachment inquiry pending before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lawmakers say they are particularly furious at the
national committee, saying it has fallen woefully short of past
elections in financing efforts to help House and Senate candidates.
In fact, the Democratic Party has struggled to raise $11 million in
a highly publicized ``Unity'' program to help candidates this year
despite an original goal of $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   And although the two organizations that help finance the party's
candidates, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, wanted to divide the $11
million raised, the party took a third for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials said they did not have a precise figure of how
much less the party committees were taking in from the national
party this year. But, as an example, in the last midterm election,
in 1994, the party made a direct transfer of $2 million to the
Congressional Campaign Committee. So far this year, the party had
transferred only $715,000 to the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in Congress are also angry that officials in the party
and at the White House have argued publicly that, given historical
trends, anything less than a 25-seat loss for House Democrats would
be a victory. Party officials said such remarks were intended to
lower expectations so even large losses will not be interpreted as
a referendum on whether President Clinton should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the senatorial and congressional committees
complain that such talk is at odds with their own public
predictions that the Democrats could pick up seats.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Monday, Rangel said he was outraged at recent
public comments by Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, the general chairman
of the Democratic National Committee, that the party could lose
many House seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I don't know what the hell the DNC does _ let him do
what he has to do for the president,'' Rangel said of Romer. ``He's
not elected to a damn thing. And nobody should give a damn about
his opinion. He's not entitled to an opinion of congressional
races. He's an appointee. It happens to all of us. You get on
television and you become an expert.''
</P>
<P>
   Accusing the Democratic National Committee of being stingy, he
said: ``Keep your money and shut up your mouth. What damn
credibility has he got as governor of Colorado? He just should shut
up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it like the whole world is waiting to see what's going to
happen in November based on the governor's evaluation of
congressional seats?'' Rangel continued. ``Give me a break!'' Party
officials, he said, ``suck up the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel was so infuriated that he upbraided Romer in a telephone
conversation on Thursday. ``Rangel was exactly correct to call
Romer on that,'' said Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, chairman of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ``Romer is simply
wrong. We're going to pick up seats.'' The party, he said, has been
so starved for money that ``we told our candidates they couldn't
rely on the national party coming in and helping them _ they had to
put it together themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee has been so unhelpful, Frost
added, that his own committee ``has taken the role that
historically the DNC would have filled in some areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer responded by accusing the party's Democratic leaders of
``misplaced grousing.'' He said, ``We were $15 million in debt. We
borrowed as much as our banks would loan us, to be honest about
it.'' He also said the party had to spend more than $12 million in
legal bills related to campaign finance investigations of the 1996
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Rangel's comments, he said, ``Charlie is concerned
that when he is out motivating his troops he wants to say, `We're
going to win the majority back.' That's what you say when you're
out there on stump. But if I'm going to keep my credibility, I
can't give you campaign rhetoric and say, `that's my expectation.'
I want them to win a majority. That's just a hard reach.''
</P>
<P>
   In all but one midterm election since the Civil War, the party
of the president has lost ground in the House of Representative,
from two to 96 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Several House Democratic officials _ including backers of Rep.
Dick Gephardt, the minority leader, who is considering running for
president _ suggested that the White House was sitting on money so
the party would be well-positioned to help Gore run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Sosnik, a senior White House adviser, disputed that
Clinton has been inattentive to the financial needs of candidates.
``The president has spent a tremendous amount of time fund raising
on behalf of House and Senate candidates for the past two years,''
he said. ``If you have any doubts, look up how many articles have
been written about how much time he has spent going to fund
raisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another top White House official said the congressional
Democrats were too demanding _ and unrealistic. ``They're
whining,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``Everybody wants more money, and they're just looking
for someone to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the clashes are competing interests at the
highest levels of the Democratic Party. They are in some ways an
escalation of strains from 1994 when congressional Democrats
accused Clinton of costing them control of the House, and 1996,
when they said he did not do enough to help the party try to regain
the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that the leaders of the party can't get
together and agree on a single approach to these last weeks,'' said
Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster whose clients include Gephardt
and Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate Democratic leader.
``All these committees are united in wanting to help Democrats. But
the political imperatives work in different directions for
different elements of the Democratic Party, whether you're talking
about how money should be spent or how expectations should be
set.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several state Democratic leaders have also complained that they
need more money, particularly since the Republican Party has
outraised the Democrats by tens of millions of dollars in this
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never enough and we need more,'' said Art Torres,
chairman of the California Democratic Party. ``My only frame of
reference is '96. It was much more generous last time, but that was
a presidential year.'' Torres added that he understands ``it's
really tough when you're in the middle of a campaign to make sure
you take care of your party as well as the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   To compensate for the shortfall in fund raising for the Unity
program, the party took out a $3 million loan last month that was
divided between the campaign committees. But on a conference call
with Clinton last month, party officials said, Congressional
Democrats had asked for $8 million. Participating in the call, the
officials said, were Gephardt, Daschle and Frost.
</P>
<P>
   Romer said he has no apologies for not raising more money.
``We've put the well dry,'' he said, adding that banks refused to
loan the cash-strapped party any more money.
</P>
<P>
   But Rangel was not impressed. ``He's a nice person,'' he said of
the governor. ``When he's quiet.''

FASHION NOTES AND NEWS: THE FAILURE VIRUS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANCE C.R. WHITE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The spate of closed and crippled companies spreading
like a virus in fashion can be traced back to the late 1980s, when
Bloomingdale's was acquired by a Canadian developer, Robert
Campeau. It was not until Bloomingdale's was forced into bankruptcy
that it became apparent that Campeau was playing a real estate game
and knew little about fashion and cared less.
</P>
<P>
   As a bankrupt chain, and one owned by a real estate developer at
that, Bloomingdale's was forced to think narrowly in terms of
return on square footage, rather than focus on fashion
merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   Campeau's legacy of store consolidations and bottomline-oriented
retailing _ which has spread to other department-store chains _ is
seeing its denouement in the present spate of troubled fashion
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Each story is individual, but the troubles indicate broad
structural adjustments afoot. Stores are increasingly putting the
squeeze on manufacturers, demanding they accept unsold merchandise,
pay for advertising and underwrite sales help.
</P>
<P>
   The virus has spread to all levels, hitting designer lines and
bridge companies alike. Each new closing is a sad surprise with
even the most seasoned industry watchers unable to predict who's
next.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Oldham, who last week announced that he was closing his
wholesale collection business, had looked to some like a likely
candidate to buckle with his rollicking shows and innovative
ornamentation. Oldham said Monday, sounding unapologetic, ``I never
pretended for one minute that anyone needed anything I did.'' A
small signature line will be sold in his store at 123 Wooster
Street (Prince Street) and at another in Japan, he said. ``When
you're making silver bras dotted with Swarovski crystals, it didn't
do much to secure our name in the salability hall of fame,'' Oldham
added.
</P>
<P>
   But names of wide appeal and sobriety have also been hit.
Nautica, a powerhouse in the men's business, said last week it will
end its two-year-old licensing agreement with Chaus, an American
apparel company, to produce the Nautica women's collection after
the fall 1999 season. It is not clear if a women's line will
continue after that, the president and chief designer for Nautica
International, David Chu, said Monday. Nautica has sales this year
of almost $900 million, of which 10 to 15 percent are in women's
wear.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Klein is on the block. Emanuel, amid heavy losses, earlier
this year parted with Maura DeVisscher and Kim Perrone, its top
executives. Andrea Jovine and Kenar have closed recently.
Meanwhile, Adrienne Vittadini resigned this month from her company,
which had become a shadow of its former self.
</P>
<P>
   How to explain all the turbulence? Not only have retailers
become tougher, but women have become less eager to spend all their
discretionary income on fashion _ a long-term trend that has slowed
sales in the 1990s compared with the decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the dramatic recent business failures may suggest the
end of fashion as they have known it. But in fact, fashion, which
historically has been a fragmented business of small and
medium-size players, has entered the age of the mega-brand.
``Women's has been a very tough market this past year,'' Chu said.
``There's going to be a lot more potential for shake out. If you're
a strong brand, you can survive this turmoil.''
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated department stores are churning the waters,
demanding ever bigger concessions from manufacturers. And bigger
stores need to work with bigger vendors.
</P>
<P>
   The realigning of fashion has meant that talented designers with
their own collection must hire themselves out to survive. As in a
film about the Wild West, the star designer-for-hire comes to town,
barrels loaded, creates a commotion and cleans up a dusty fashion
house.
</P>
<P>
   And small design houses now find it safer and are surviving by
establishing their own boutiques instead of relying on department
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Oldham, whose collection has been carried in Bloomingdale's,
Saks Fifth Avenue and Henri Bendel's, said he plans to open small
jeans stores selling his jeans line and TO2, a lower-price junior
collection. It is doubtful that without his two signature stores
Oldham could have done as well as he had for so long.

COURT DOCUMENT SUGGESTS WILLEY MAY HAVE TRIED TO AID JONES
LAWSUIT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kathleen Willey, a one-time White House volunteer
who has said she was briefly groped in the Oval Office by President
Clinton, may have once tried to help Paula Corbin Jones succeed in
her sexual misconduct lawsuit against the president, according to a
court documents filed by a former Jones lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The statement by the lawyer, Joseph Cammarata, was contained in
previously-sealed documents from Mrs. Jones' lawsuit that were
released Monday in Little Rock. But the documents also show how
Mrs. Willey came to staunchly resist getting involved in the Jones
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, who has reported to
Congress that Clinton may have committed impeachable offenses in
connection with the Jones lawsuit, is still investigating whether
anyone sought to influence Mrs. Willey to alter her account of her
encounter with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit, Cammarata said that when he was representing
Mrs. Jones, he received a telephone call in January 1997 from a
woman who did not give her name but who said she had an experience
with Clinton similar to that of Mrs. Jones. Cammarata said he
became confident that the woman was Mrs. Willey because the caller
was familiar with material that could only be known at the time by
Mrs. Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, Mrs. Willey said she did not make any telephone
call to Cammarata, the documents released Monday showed. But at the
time Mrs. Willey denied she was the caller, she was working to keep
her distance from the Jones lawsuit. One document showed that Mrs.
Willey hid in her house for days to avoid being served with a
subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Willey's lawyers, according to some of the documents, said
that her experience with Clinton was not relevant to Mrs. Jones'
case. In August 1997, Mrs. Willey's lawyer told the court that the
Jones lawyers were trying to invade her privacy and that she had no
testimony that would help Mrs. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of pages of documents released Monday by Judge
Susan Webber Wright of Federal District Court also showed that Mrs.
Jones' lawyers complained that the White House was behind an effort
to delve into her sexual history, hoping to portray her as sexually
promiscuous despite a pledge by Clinton's lawyers not to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The papers, like a similar batch released last week, vividly
portray the bitterness between the Jones' lawyers and those for the
White House. Some of the papers document the unsuccessful effort by
Mrs. Jones to buttress her claim that she witnessed distinguishing
characteristics in the president's genital area when he exposed
himself in her presence. The documents include graphic testimony by
Mrs. Jones' sister, Lydia Cathey, of Mrs. Jones' account of what
happened in a Little Rock hotel room in 1991. But Judge Wright, the
documents show, reviewed affidavits by Clinton's doctors and ruled
that Mrs. Jones' allegations were ``baseless and scurrilous.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones sued the president in 1994, saying that three years
earlier, when he was Governor of Arkansas and she was a state
clerical employee, he had her summoned to his hotel suite in Little
Rock, dropped his pants and asked her to perform a sex act. Clinton
has denied her account although he has said it is possible she came
to his room for an innocent introduction.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wright dismissed Mrs. Jones' suit in April, ruling that
even if her account were true, she could not make out a case of
sexual harassment. Last week, a panel of three federal judges in
St. Paul, Minn., heard arguments on whether the suit should be
reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   The documents released Monday show Mrs. Jones' lawyers appealing
to Judge Wright to prevent depositions being taken of men in
Arkansas who testified they had found Mrs. Jones eager to engage in
sex. The depositions were taken by William Bristow, an Arkansas
lawyer representing Danny Ferguson, the state trooper who Mrs.
Jones said brought her to Clinton's room and who is also a
defendant in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyer, Robert Bennett, in a television appearance in
June 1997 threatened to delve into Mrs. Jones' sexual history,
saying it would show her reputation could not have been so affected
by rumors of a sexual encounter with Clinton. But after an
avalanche of criticism from women's groups, the White House backed
off.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones' lawyers complained in their court filings that
Clinton's lawyers were behind Bristow's effort to disclose people
who said they had engaged in sex with Mrs. Jones. During a
deposition of a man who said he met Mrs. Jones in an Arkansas bar
and soon was having sex with her, Bennett passed a note to Bristow,
according to the documents. Mrs. Jones' lawyer suggested that
Bennett was orchestrating what he called a ``smear campaign''
against Mrs. Jones while publicly insisting the White House would
not engage in such tactics.

NATO EXPECTED TO EXTEND DEADLINE FOR AIR STRIKES, OFFICIALS SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (Also see YUGO-KOSOVO) 
(sw) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO is almost certain to extend the Tuesday
deadline for ordering air strikes against Yugoslav military and
police forces, NATO and Clinton administration officials said on
Monday as Yugoslav troops and equipment rumbled out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of setting a new deadline, NATO's representatives are
considering issuing a more general, open-ended threat to use force
if President Slobodan Milosevic violates his pledges and orders a
resumption of the crackdown on the people of Kosovo, who are
predominantly ethnic Albanian, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a threat is necessary, the officials said, to keep the
pressure on Milosevic to abide by his agreements to end the
fighting and allow ethnic Albanians return to the homes they fled
over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge now is how do you do it without looking like
you're extending the deadline forever,'' a Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said on Monday night that NATO
has made no final decision about the Tuesday deadline, which clears
the way for NATO's military commanders to launch strikes after 2
p.m., ET. The official emphasized NATO still needed to verify that
Monday's withdrawals proved meaningful and was still prepared, if
necessary, to order military strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Even as some of Yugoslavia's army and paramilitary forces
noisily departed positions in Kosovo, there were indications that
Milosevic continued to move slowly in complying with some parts of
the agreement and to violate others outright.
</P>
<P>
   The international diplomats now roaming the province reported
that the Yugoslav armed forces had been spotted moving around
anti-aircraft missiles, in violation of the agreement permitting
unarmed reconnaissance aircraft to fly over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The observers spotted trucks carrying Soviet-era surface-to-air
missiles, or SAMs, in ways that ``indicate the missiles have been
deployed,'' they wrote in a cable on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the Pentagon said NATO had not detected any
provocative deployments that could jeopardize the reconnaissance
flights. Flights so far have been limited to unmanned drones and
U-2 spyplanes that fly high enough to avoid missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In a marathon of meetings over the weekend in Belgrade, NATO's
commanders, Gen. Wesley Clark of the United States and Gen. Klaus
Naumann of Germany, extracted assurances from Milosevic and his
army chief of staff, Gen. Momcilo Perisic, that they would begin
withdrawals before Tuesday's deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the threat of NATO strikes, Milosevic even signed a
schedule for withdrawals that detailed, in writing, the names and
numbers of units that had to pull out of Kosovo or return to their
barracks.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO and administration officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that those assurances appeared to be enough to
avert air strikes, barring some egregious turnaround by Milosevic.
By Monday night, the senior administration official said, it
appeared all 4,500 paramilitary police deployed to the province
during the peak of the crackdown had been withdrawn, most of them
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said that it appeared
``General Clark's meetings with President Milosevic may have had
some impact, because we do see a lot of movement.'' He added, ``We
want to make sure that that movement is real.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO authorized the use of force against Milosevic on Oct. 12
but gave him four days to comply with U.N. resolutions calling for
an end to the fighting. When that deadline neared, NATO extended
the deadline to Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials said the deadlines have been helpful, but have
also raised expectations that NATO will act forcefully to punish
Milosevic for a crackdown that left hundreds dead and drove tens of
thousands from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These deadlines put NATO under as much pressure as
Milosevic,'' a NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   With the new deadline nearing, administration and NATO officials
have been scrambling to find a way to maintain the threat,
especially since Milosevic appears intent on playing a
cat-and-mouse game with NATO commanders, doing just enough to avert
strikes, but not to comply completely.
</P>
<P>
   One NATO official said the largest army battalion withdrawn so
far _ the 211th Armored Brigade _ left Kosovo but remained just
over the border. Milosevic and his military aides explained they
would not move the division back to its barracks because to do so
would make it an easier target for NATO.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ They have trained and rehearsed.
</P>
<P>
   They have planned their order of appearance, their scripts, the
choreography, even the clothes they will wear today when they stand
before 31 NFL owners and plead for an expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   No detail is too small. ``Does this suit make me look fat? Do
these shoes go with these socks? Does this tie say, `We're Houston
_ take us?'''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston contingent of NFL dreamers has descended upon Kansas
City for today's NFL meetings. The theme it hopes to deliver was
best described by ownership hopeful Bob McNair when the Houston
stadium-financing plan was finalized last week: Houston has steak.
Los Angeles has sizzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready to go right now,'' said Steve Patterson, who
helped coordinate the NFL pitch and has been in the middle of
stadium-financing negotiations from the start. ``We will build the
first and so far only retractable-roof, natural-grass football
stadium in the world. It will be the greatest stadium in the world.
It will be in the heart of football country _ football-crazy
country. We've got the commitment. We've got the resources. We've
got tremendous support and infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   But what the Houston group does not have is time. Or the LA
sizzle.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it has made up ground recently, Los Angeles is behind
Houston on virtually every front when it comes to presenting a
viable expansion package. But, oh, that sizzle. It tempts the NFL's
palate.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, there is a rock-solid stadium proposal _ dotted I's
and crossed T's, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Los Angeles has two proposals _ the one by former
super-agent and Walt Disney executive Michael Ovitz and the one
headed by Ed Roski, which is endorsed by the LA city council and
calls for the complete redesign of the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, there is public support and, more important,
governmental support. The way Mayor Lee Brown, McNair, County Judge
Robert Eckels, sports authority chief Jack Rains and Patterson came
together on the deal last week was hugely impressive. Individually,
each represented entirely different interests. One might have
believed it difficult for these five powers to agree on what to
order for lunch, much less a $310 million stadium. But they did it.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Ovitz and the Coliseum partners have divided
loyalties with their NFL pitches, which on paper are equally
impressive but also equally riddled with holes, financing
shortcomings and political flash points.
</P>
<P>
   On top of everything, while Houston has voiced support for a
return of the NFL, a recent Los Angeles Times poll indicated that
nearly 60 percent of Southern Californians do not consider having a
football team important to them. Nearly 70 percent said they would
not support using public funds to build a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In so many ways, this looks like it should be a simple choice
for NFL owners _ Houston over Los Angeles. Steak over sizzle. But
this is Los Angeles sizzle, which cannot be underestimated. It is
flash and cash.
</P>
<P>
   It is why the Houston group will be hoping to swoop into KC
today and persuade the owners to make a quick decision regarding
expansion, giving Houston what it is ready to provide. Football.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners want it done fast, too. Concerned about scheduling
problems that the 31st team _ Cleveland _ will give the league next
year, some are pushing for a 32nd team to begin playing as early as
2000. This is great for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But other owners are listening to the sizzle and are being
swayed by the pomp, not the circumstance. They see the glamorous
stars involved in the Ovitz group _ Tom Cruise, Kevin Costner,
Jerry West and Magic Johnson _ and are wowed.
</P>
<P>
   They're thinking about the difference a Los Angeles NFL team
would have on television negotiations in 2004, compared to the
effect a Houston team might have.
</P>
<P>
   They realize Los Angeles might not be ready right now, but if it
can be ready in a couple of months _ six months, maybe even late
next year _ it could be worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that we want an NFL team in the second-biggest market
again, no question,'' Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay said.
``There's no need to rush it.''
</P>
<P>
   For LA, there is no need at all. It is the sizzle. In fact, even
before these meetings opened, Ovitz criss-crossed the country
visiting NFL owners, showing them plans and designs for his
proposed Hacienda stadium in Carson, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz brought here those same drawings and computer-generated
images of the 78,000-seat stadium, which would be the centerpiece
of a 160-acre NFL Disneyland of sorts, with a giant mall,
entertainment center and Spanish-style stadium complete with a
church tower and bells that ring for every touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   It is impressive sizzle, no doubt. All McNair, Patterson and Co.
can hope for is that when in Kansas City, the NFL owners do like KC
folk and crave steak.

DOW JONES ANNOUNCES PLAN TO INCREASE EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER and GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Less than a year after swallowing a $1 billion loss
from its unsuccessful venture into financial information services,
Dow Jones &AMP; Co., the publisher of The Wall Street Journal,
announced a three-year financial plan on Monday that is intended to
increase earnings 10 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   In a presentation to securities analysts, top Dow Jones
executives emphasized the growth potential of the electronic
businesses and signaled belt-tightening and efficiency measures at
The Journal and other publications.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while analysts have been lukewarm about the company's
stock, and some dissident shareholders have called for a more
sweeping shakeup, the Dow Jones plan is a cautious one, some
analysts said. It appears to be aimed more at reassuring investors
with evidence of self-discipline, and less at inspiring them with a
corporate vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of slow and steady building there,'' said Steven
Barlow, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston after the
meeting in lower Manhattan. ``You've got a big organization that
had been somewhat complacent in its budgeting processes _ never
looking out all that far into the future. Just to institute
thinking in that direction is something.''
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's presentation, Dow Jones' chief financial officer,
Jerry Bailey, said that the print publishing segment of Dow Jones,
which includes The Journal, Barron's and several smaller
publications, is expected to produce operating cash flow margins of
25 percent, down from 27 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested there would be a more cost-conscious approach at
The Journal, which had the most profitable year in its history last
year, but which has experienced a sharp drop in advertising revenue
in the last two months from a year ago. The company plans to invest
$238 million over the next three years to expand The Journal's page
and color capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The detail provided in Bailey's presentation was welcomed by
analysts, and some found that the cautious earnings projections
were a sign that Dow Jones executives were conscious of the
skepticism in their audience.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones shares rose 75 cents Monday, to $44.5625, but still
near its 52-week low of $41.5625, which was reached on Oct. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a first date with someone,'' David Winters, a
securities analyst for Franklin Mutual Advisors. ``You don't want
to overpromise.'' Winters, whose firm owns 3.8 million shares, or
about a 4 percent stake, added, ``Bailey is focused on doing the
right things for the long term, which is what it is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Another analyst was less impressed. ``The long-term
earnings-per-share targets don't seem that aggressive,'' said
Lauren Rich Fine, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. ``The target goals
are just the averages of where they have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many analysts see Bailey, 46, as a rising star at Dow
Jones, which he joined in April after having been chief financial
officer at Salomon Inc. from 1993 to 1997. He was recruited with
the support of the descendants of the Bancroft family _ who control
the voting shares of the company _ and the outside board members,
who include Harvey Golub, the chief executive of American Express,
and Irvine Hockaday, chief executive of Hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   During a quarterly meeting of Bancroft family members on Oct. 6
at the Boston law firm of Hemingway &AMP; Barnes, the discussion
revolved around the three-year plan prepared by Bailey, according
to a person who was present but spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But Bailey's track record at Salomon was mixed, according to two
former Salomon executives. When Bailey was named chief financial
officer, the firm had already begun an accounting review that
eventually led Salomon to announce a loss of $364 million for 1994,
of which roughly a third was a charge taken for ``unreconciled
balances'' at its London operations.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, however, the firm announced $35 million more
in losses because of a bookkeeping blunder. Salomon's chairman and
chief executive at the time, Robert Denham, who is now a partner at
the Los Angeles law firm of Munger, Tolles &AMP; Olson, said last week
that the problem was not Bailey's fault.
</P>
<P>
   But the second round of losses apparently upset top-level
executives. One, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: ``There
is no question that some members of senior management felt it was
Bailey's problem because he was the CFO and all accounting reported
to him. He had signed off on it.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Bailey said, ``Given the nature of
anything that size, there are always changes in estimates.'' As to
any lessons he learned from the experience, he said, ``Do your
homework on a company before you join.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last week's management changes at Dow Jones included the
resignation of the president, Kenneth Burenga, and the elevation of
Bailey and Peter Skinner, 54, the company's general counsel, to
executive vice president. Gordon Crovitz, a former editor and
publisher of The Far Eastern Economic Review, was named senior vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Crovitz's portfolio includes the electronic businesses where the
company hopes to get much of its earnings growth. The most visible
of these endeavors, the Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition,
has been a success, attracting 256,000 paying subscribers by Sept.
30. It is expected to show a profit in 1999. The electronic
products include the Dow Jones news wires.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Crovitz, 40, has raised expectations that he
may become a candidate for chief executive, succeeding Peter Kann,
who has confounded dissident stockholders' predictions that the
costly miscalculations on the former financial-services unit, Dow
Jones Markets, once known as Telerate, would cost him his job.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the career path of Crovitz, a former editorial writer at
The Journal, mirrors those of most Dow Jones chief executives who
began as journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the new management changes gave clues to his eventual
successor, Kann said, ``I intend to be around for a while.'' He
added, ``I do think that in a content company, whoever holds the
top job should have a deep understanding about the editorial
product and editorial integrity.'' But, he said, ``There's no
inevitability that a reporter always holds my title.''

APARTHEID PANEL TO IMPLICATE FORMER LEADERS, ANC OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BEN BRADLEE JR.  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Truth And Reconciliation Commission will conclude Thursday
that several leaders of the former government _ including President
P.W. Botha _ issued orders or framed policies that led to
abductions, tortures, deaths in detention, bombings and killings,
according to sources familiar with the document.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's final report, the sources said, will also name
several key members of the former liberation movements as having
been responsible for excesses and abuses _ including deaths by
firing squad, inhuman conditions of incarceration, torture, and
beatings.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these men are now leading officials in the ruling
African National Congress government.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the five-volume, 3,500-page Truth Commission
report caps a turbulent 2 1/2-year investigation into the country's
blood-soaked past. It marks a watershed for post-apartheid South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, the final report calls on the African
National Congress to accept ``collective responsibility'' for human
rights abuses committed by its members during the struggle against
the former regime.
</P>
<P>
   Among the senior ANC members who, sources said, will be listed
in the ``findings and conclusions'' section of the final report are
the former ANC national commissar, Andrew Masondo, now a general in
the South African National Defense Force, and Joe Modise,
then-chief of the ANC's guerrilla wing and now the defense
minister.
</P>
<P>
   The report will also allege that bombings by the apartheid
government, in which scores were wounded but no one was killed, had
been planned by the former law and order minister, Adriaan Vlok,
and former police commissioner, Johan Van der Merwe.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, former President F.W. de Klerk, who shared the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 with the current president, Nelson
Mandela, will also be named as an ``accessory after the fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission concluded that de Klerk knew about the
involvement of Vlok and Van der Merwe, but never informed police.
</P>
<P>
   Most prominent on the list of people to whom the commission has
assigned blame is Botha, who is expected to be found responsible
for several incidents, including the Johannesburg bombings of
Khotso House in 1987 and Cosatu House in 1988. The first building
housed religious organizations; the second the country's largest
labor federation.
</P>
<P>
   Botha, who as president headed the secretive State Security
Council where key executive decisions were taken, will be among
several council members to be found responsible for the bombings,
according to the sources, who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The Truth Commission, led by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, is
empowered to grant amnesty to those found to have testified
truthfully about crimes carried out with a political motive, if
they confess and ask for the amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Neither de Klerk nor Botha has applied for the amnesty, and thus
both are liable for prosecution. De Klerk is expected to go to
court today in a last-ditch attempt to prevent the commission from
publishing its finding against him.
</P>
<P>
   The report is also expected to shed new light on so-called
``black-on-black'' violence between the ANC and followers of the
Inkatha Party of the Zulu chief, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, in which
about 10,000 people have been killed over the past 15 years, mostly
in the former Natal province.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been suspected, but not proven, that the former
white minority regime had helped orchestrate the violence through a
network of surrogate groups that came to be known as as the ``Third
Force.''
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, the report, citing State Security Council
memoranda, will allege that the Third Force was part of an official
government strategy called ``counter-mobilization.'' It will detail
how Pretoria supplied arms to Buthelezi and trained his fighters at
a base in Namibia called the Caprivi Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The former regime also stirred the pot in Western Cape Province,
where it supported older, more conservative migrant workers against
young people aligned with the ANC in battles to control townships,
the report will say.
</P>
<P>
   The report will also name former Defense Minister Magnus Malan
as an architect of the counter-mobilization strategy. In addition,
sources say the report will find Malan responsible for military
raids on suspected ANC targets in neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
   When Tutu presents the report to President Mandela Thursday in
Pretoria, it will mark a milestone for South Africa, eight years
after Mandela was released from prison and more than four years
after the country's first all-race elections.
</P>
<P>
   The commission consists of 17 promiment South Africans from
different walks of life, appointed by Mandela with a broad mandate
to determine what happened in the apartheid years, to promote
reconciliation in the country, to pay reparations to those found to
have suffered human rights violations, and to grant amnesty to
perpetrators of the violations where appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   These goals represented a bold effort in a deeply divided
society to come to terms with its ignominious past and to lay a
foundation for a more harmonious future.
</P>
<P>
   The deal for amnesty was central to the decision by former
President de Klerk, in negotiations with the ANC, to begin
relinquishing power to Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   De Klerk's National Party had been pushing for a blanket amnesty
to cover all of the excesses of the past, but finally agreed to the
current system, in which individuals are evaluated on a
case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's report, which has been delayed at least twice, will
not represent the end of the Truth Commission's work. That is
because the panel's Amnesty Committee, which makes its own
decisions on amnesty cases, and which operates independently from
the rest of the commission, has had to cope with more than 7,000
applications, far more than orginally expected. The Amnesty
Committee , and is not expected to finish its work until well into
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can criticize us for our slowness in coming to terms with
the amnesty process,'' said the commission spokesman, John Allen.
The size of the Amnesty Committee has grown from 5 to 19 to cope
with the extra work.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has also been criticized in some quarters for
releasing a report that will not answer the key quesions of who
will be granted amnesty for what crimes. But it decided that its
investigation had yielded a great deal _ enough to say what
happened under apartheid, and how special privileges were enshrined
for whites, and discrimination was instutionalized for the black
majority and other non-whites.
</P>
<P>
   In barnstorming the country, and eliciting often riveting
stories from more than 20,000 people found to have been victims of
human rights violations, the commission has become a fixture of
recent South African life and the subject of saturation media
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The panel has also been criticized from both ends of the
political spectrum. Whites have generally accused the panel of
conducting a witch hunt, have complained of ``truth fatigue,'' and
have ridiculed it as the ``Kleenex Commission'' for the tissues
handed out for the tears shed at its hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Many blacks, for their part, complained that too many criminals
were getting off free under amnesty, and that the ANC was being
unjustly targeted for abuses carried out as part of a
``just-cause'' war of liberation.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, plagued from the outset by underfunding,
understaffing and disorganization, has yet to deliver fully on its
mandate to pay reparations to victims. Symbolic stipends have been
granted, but the overall goal of paying each of the 22,000 victims
about $2,600 a year for six years has yet to be approved by the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the panel's overarching goal of promoting
reconciliation is in doubt: A recent national poll has found that
two-thirds of the respondents thought the commission had made race
relations worse, not better.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it has had some undeniable successes as well. The rest of
the world has scrutinized the group's work as a laboratory for
resolving racial conflict. Countries such as Chile, which have had
their own truth commissions, and Bosnia, which may in the future,
are also following the panel's progress.

<P>
   The South African commission has differed from other such panels
in its decisions to hold hearings in public, in naming perpetrators
of violent crimes, and in deciding not to grant blanket amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled mostly by the decisions of thousands of former police
officers, soldiers and members of the security forces to come to
the confessional, the commission has also been able to shed
important light on the inner workings of apartheid while solving
hundreds of crimes committed by persons previously unknown.
</P>
<P>
   There have been searing images of families unearthing the bones
of their loved ones, in killing fields identified by the soldiers
of apartheid, or of smiling security officers posing over bodies,
at cookouts held to celebrate their kills.
</P>
<P>
   For Tutu, the commission's work was as much about process as
product, a ``transparent'' undertaking in which ordinary people who
had been victims of apartheid could gain a measure of catharsis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to give people the forum by which they could tell
their story, thereby achieving one of the aims of the act:
rehabilitation of their human and civil dignity,'' Tutu said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people had been invisible. I call them the small
people,'' added the archbishop and 1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner.
``We had to say, `The nation acknowledges that something happened
to you.' So under the full glare of the television lights, we let
them tell their story with very little interruption.''
</P>
<P>
   The Truth Commission will devote the entire second volume of its
final report to identifying perpetrators and detailing who did what
to whom. New information will also be presented on the inner
workings of government-supported structures like:
</P>
<P>
   _The State Security Council, which flowered in the 1980s under
Botha as a virtual shadow government directing and authorizing
operations against anti-apartheid forces both in and out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   _The Civil Cooperation Bureau, essentially a privatized section
of the South African Defense Force which operated under the
umbrella of the Special Forces.
</P>
<P>
   _TREWITS, or the Counter Revolutionary Intelligence Task Team,
made up of security police, Special Forces, Military Intelligence
and the National Intelligence Service.
</P>
<P>
   _Koevoet, the paramilitary police structure run by the South
African Defense Force in Namibia in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   _Vlakplaas, the farm on the outskirts of Pretoria from which a
state-sponsored death squad operated under the command of Eugene de
Kock. De Kock has emerged as the chief namer of names in the
apartheid era, and has a 4,000-page amnesty application pending
before the Truth Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said a section of Volume 2 will also attempt to assign
responsibility for the cross-border raids that the apartheid regime
made against neighboring countries like Angola, Mozambique,
Lesotho, Swaziland, Botswana and Zambia in an effort to punish the
states for harboring and assisting antiapartheid forces.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the political spectrum, the prominent among
the commission's findings against the ANC are abuses it is said to
have committed at a former detention facility in Angola known as
Quatro, or Camp Four. Several cases of abuses ranging from
beatings, brutal interrogation, torture and killing were
investigated by the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said the report will say the ANC must also bear
responsibility for the actions of Mandela's former wife, Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela, in connection with the 1991 death of a young
Soweto activist. Madikizela-Mandela was convicted of kidnap and
assault in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Besides focusing on both extremes of the conflict, the final
report will also assess the role played by white noncombatants _
the so-called ``benficiaries'' of apartheid, such as business
executives, lawyers, jurists, doctors, the clergy and journalists.
The report will find that all sectors played supportive, if
compliant, roles in the flowering of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the major success of the Truth Commission is that it
has placed information in the public domain from which people can
gain knowledge about the past,'' said Charles Villa-Vicencio, the
commission's research director who presided over the writing of the
final report. ``But there needs to be a distinction between
knowledge and acknowledgement. The nation has been brought to
acknowledgement.''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu added: ``For many years the public was fed a whole tissue
of lies. Most of us had a hunch of what had happened, but we didn't
have the precise details. Now these details are going to come
forward ... We much face up to the horrors of the past or we will
not be serving our country.''

 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For several years, Mattson Technology Inc. in Fremont, Calif.,
embodied the Silicon Valley dream. Sales tripled from one year to
the next. When the company's stock was first sold to the public in
1994, about a dozen executives became millionaires. One year the
company took all employees and their families to Lake Tahoe, Nev.,
for a Christmas vacation.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the Christmas party will probably be potluck.
Mattson's sales have dropped in half from their peak last year. One
round of layoffs at the 400-person company has occurred and another
is in the works. And the company's stock, which traded above $16 in
July 1997, has fallen to $5.375, making employee stock options
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Mattson's travails come from across the sea. Two thirds of its
sales _ it makes million-dollar machines used in manufacturing
computer chips _ are to semiconductor factories in Asia, which have
cut back sharply on their spending in the face of Asia's economic
crisis. ``It's like a faucet,'' said Brad Mattson, the company's
president. ``They just turned off the spigot.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattson is perhaps an extreme case but it is not alone. Silicon
Valley, the nation's cauldron of innovation, has suddenly been hit
by a one-two punch from forces originating thousands of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian economic crisis, which began in July 1997, has slowed
exports, causing a cascade of layoffs. And the stock market
volatility has battered technology company shares, making it harder
for young companies to raise money and crimping the spending of
workers whose sense of wealth is tied to the stock options that are
considered a birthright in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The double blow has tempered the exuberance of a region that has
witnessed an explosion of growth, prosperity and extravagance in
the last few years, a region in which 20-something Internet
millionaires routinely plunked down cash for fancy cars and near $1
million even for a relatively plain three-bedroom house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panic has not yet set in, but reality has,'' said Paul Saffo,
an analyst at the Institute for the Future, a Silicon Valley
research center.
</P>
<P>
   The same forces are at work elsewhere, of course, but few parts
of the country are as tied to both Asia and the stock market as is
this area south of San Francisco. And fewer are more important to
the nation's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the damage has been slight. The unemployment rate in
Santa Clara County, which encompasses San Jose and much of Silicon
Valley, has climbed in recent months but was still an enviable 3.7
percent in September, well below the 6.9 percent rate experienced
in 1992 after cutbacks among military contractors. The expensive
restaurants that have sprung up amidst the burger joints near
Stanford University are still bustling.
</P>
<P>
   But million-dollar homes are no longer selling at the same
frenzied pace and vacancies are starting to grow in the office real
estate market. The electronics and computer industries ranked first
and second nationwide in terms of the number of job cuts announced
this year, according to Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, a
Chicago-based outplacement firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this noticeable crispness in the air, and not just
because it's fall,'' said Betsy Collard, director of strategic
development at the Career Action Center in Cupertino, Calif., which
counsels those seeking new jobs. The Milken Institute, a nonprofit
economic research organization in Santa Monica, Calif., forecasts
that the San Jose area could experience a recession if the Asian
crisis takes a turn for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose surged ahead of New York and Detroit in the last few
years to become the largest exporter among metropolitan areas, and
nearly half of those exports go to East Asia, according to the
Milken report. No American city is as dependent on Asian exports
for income as is San Jose. But the impacts of the Asian crisis vary
greatly. The biggest has been on companies that, like Mattson, make
the machinery used to manufacture chips. Applied Materials, the
giant of this business, has cut about one quarter of its work
force, or 4,000 jobs, this year.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that make the chips themselves are also ailing, not
only because of Asia's slump but because of its previous boom, when
companies there built so many factories they caused a glut that
depressed semiconductor prices.
</P>
<P>
   The semiconductor business is known for its steep up and down
cycles. But, ``I've been in the business since 1957 and this is the
worst one,'' said Alfred Stein, chief executive of VLSI Technology
in San Jose. Though some chip companies and analysts see signs of
an upturn, the pain is not over yet. The LSI Logic Corp., in
Milpitas, Calif., recently announced a 17 percent reduction in its
work force.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some economists say the impact of the Asian crisis has
not been as big as expected. For California as a whole, increased
exports to Canada, Mexico and Europe have helped offset a decline
in shipments to Asia. Another tempering factor is that the biggest
job growth now comes not from silicon chip manufacturing, the
business that gave the region its nickname, but from smaller
companies in newer fields like the Internet and computer software,
which have less exposure to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel we've been affected one bit by the economic
turmoil,'' said Alex Kaplinsky, managing partner of the local
office of USWeb, a company that designs Internet software for
corporate clients. The 26-year-old Kaplinsky, who recently paid
cash for a Porsche, a Lexus and a house, said his office has 27 job
openings.
</P>
<P>
   But jobs in the Internet economy are not always available to
those from the silicon economy. ``I know so little about their
industry that it's a difficult transfer,'' said Art Hall, 50, who
was laid off in June from Novellus Systems, a semiconductor
equipment manufacturer in San Jose. Even if small companies escape
the direct effects of the Asian crisis, however, they are still
being hit by the stock market downturn, which makes it harder to
raise capital.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite a strong rally in the last two weeks, an index of 275
technology stocks maintained by Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, a San Francisco
investment bank, is down 14.2 percent from its high in July,
compared with an 9.7 percent fall for the Dow Jones industrial
average. USWeb's stock has fallen to $14.50, from a high of more
than $38 in April.
</P>
<P>
   The flow of initial public stock offerings has ground to a halt,
with dozens either postponed or canceled. In September, only one
high technology company went public, versus about 10 a month in
June and July, said Jim Davidson, manager of technology investment
banking at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. There has been none so far in
October, though the recent market rally might change that.
</P>
<P>
   Initial offerings provide the rewards to venture capitalists and
other early investors in companies _ and to employees, who put in
back-breaking hours in hopes their stock will be worth a bundle
when the company goes public. If that outlet is closed for long,
the money flow can back up because lower rates of return can
discourage future investing in initial offerings and thus less
money for venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the breakfast tables at restaurants favored by the
venture capital crowd, like the rustic Buck's in Woodside and the
upscale Il Fornaio in Palo Alto, are still buzzing. One morning
recently, Ben Rosen, a New York venture capitalist, was having four
back-to-back breakfast meetings at Il Fornaio with companies
seeking investment.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists are now flush with cash and have a long time
frame for their investments. Still, they acknowledge, a slumping
market has a psychological effect, making them less willing to
finance marginal ventures. Even solid companies will get less money
than they would have a few months ago. ``Anyone with an Internet
idea could get funding, and I think that's going to start to
change,'' said Vinod Khosla, a partner at the venture capital firm
Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers.
</P>
<P>
   Some empty office buildings are starting to appear in a region
that has had one of the lowest vacancy rates in the nation, about 4
percent by one estimate. Take the four-building Baytech business
park in San Jose, built last year. It was first leased by Cisco
Systems, a telecommunications equipment supplier, which turned out
not to need the space. Then Applied Materials leased it, but ran
into the Asian crisis. Now Applied is trying to sublease the
never-occupied buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Several retailers of cars and jewelry said they had seen no
softening of sales so far. But at Mattson Technology and elsewhere,
employees who now cannot count on stock options to boost their
incomes are postponing purchases of big items.
</P>
<P>
   Barak Kassar, 31, marketing director for Wink Communications,
was shopping for a home he hoped to buy partly with proceeds from
his company's initial public stock offering. But Wink, which makes
interactive television technology, has put off its offering, and
Kassar has stopped his house-hunting for now. ``It just may be a
few months longer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, the housing market was manic. ``Even for houses
up to $5 million, there were sometimes two or three offers _
unbelievable,'' said Wendy McPherson, manager of the Menlo Park
office of Coldwell Banker, a real estate brokerage. Homes often
sold for tens of thousands of dollars more than the asking price.
Lower-paid workers had to move as far as two hours away from their
work places to find affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``we're not getting 10 offers on a house anymore,'' Ms.
McPherson said, tooling her Mercedes past a three-bedroom ranch
home with a narrow yard that is listed for $939,000 and had not
sold in three weeks. Her office sold only two or three
million-dollar homes in the last month, down from 10 or 12 a month
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The median home price in Santa Clara County dropped 1.8 percent
from August to September, to $366,550, according to the California
Association of Realtors. Still, home prices are up a whopping 11.8
percent from a year ago. ``This is heaven still,'' Ms. McPherson
said. ``We've lost our perspective over the last 20 months.''
</P>
<P>
   For now then, Silicon Valley's slowdown is only in comparison to
the frenetic _ and unsustainable _ pace of the last few years. Many
people here maintain an abiding faith in technology and their
future prosperity. At a recent meeting on the region's future held
by the Churchill Club, a public affairs forum, the theme was ``Buy,
Sell or Hold?'' In a show of hands, only a smattering of people in
the audience chose ``Sell.''

GLENN ARRIVES AT SPACE CENTER, MARVELS AT GLOBAL ATTENTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Grinning from ear to ear, John Glenn
arrived at NASA's Kennedy Space Center on Monday and marveled at
the global attention his upcoming shuttle flight has generated.
</P>
<P>
   The 77-year-old U.S. senator is scheduled to blast off Thursday
at 1 p.m., CST, as one of seven crew members aboard the shuttle
Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   As the countdown got under way, all of the attention was riveted
on Glenn, who became the first American to orbit the Earth on Feb.
20, 1962.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been pleasantly surprised at the outpouring of interest
in this flight,'' he told the dozens of reporters and photographers
who greeted the shuttle crew. ``It's really gratifying to see
people getting so fired up about the space program again.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew's arrival was delayed by an hour when one of the four
NASA jet trainers bringing them from Houston to Florida would not
restart after a refueling stop in Panama City, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better late than never,'' said Discovery commander Curt Brown.
``We're here. We're happy, and we'll be ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Awaiting Glenn's arrival were his wife, Annie, and other members
of his family, who admit they have had to overcome misgivings about
the elderly astronaut's quest to fly in space again.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn will retire from the Senate in December after 55 years of
service to his country including stints as a combat pilot, a test
pilot and one of NASA's original seven astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking forward to having him as my own,'' said Annie
Glenn. ``I wasn't 100 percent behind (the flight).''
</P>
<P>
   Then last spring she was invited to join her husband as he
trained at the Johnson Space Center. The training and the emphasis
that NASA placed on safety turned her around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came home 100 percent behind the whole thing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting used to it,'' said Glenn's 53-year-old son, David,
a California doctor. ``I felt pretty negative, and wondered what
happened if anything went wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable with the whole thing right now,'' said David
Glenn, father of the senator's two grandchildren, Daniel, 16, and
Zach, 12. ``I will feel more comfortable after the launching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very very happy for him,'' said Glenn's daughter, Lyn, 51.
``He's so challenged and committed to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's wife and children were not allowed to come to the Cape
to watch his launch in 1962 because the chance of a traumatic
accident was so high.
</P>
<P>
   The start of Discovery's countdown and the crew's arrival on
Monday signaled the start of a race by ground teams to launch the
nine-day mission before either Hurricane Mitch jeopardizes the
liftoff or the Leonid meteor shower can pose an orbital safety
threat.
</P>
<P>
   If Discovery does not blast off by Nov. 5, the mission could
face a lengthy postponement, because the space agency does not want
to risk damage from the meteor shower which is expected to peak on
Nov. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Priselac, NASA's forecaster, placed the prospect of favorable
weather for Thursday's launch window, which stretches from 1 p.m.
to 3:30 p.m., at 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters are concerned that gales Thursday could exceed the
17 mph limit for a runway that the shuttle crew would use if an
emergency landing became necessary. The outlook Friday was
identical.
</P>
<P>
   Then the launch attempts face at least four-day suspension so
that ground servicing teams can replenish the fuel stores that
generate electricity aboard Discovery and refurbish the many
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly don't know where hurricane Mitch will be at that
time or what its intensity will be,'' said Priselac.
</P>
<P>
   If the storm takes a northerly turn into the Gulf of Mexico, it
could force NASA shuttle program managers to pull Discovery from
the launch pad.
</P>
<P>
   The Leonids, a swarm of meteors produced as the Earth passes
through the tale of the Comet Tempel-Tuttle, pose the more novel
potential threat to Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the decision a couple of years ago that the shuttle
would not fly this year or next year during the Leonids,'' said
NASA's Nicholas Johnson, who assesses the risk to the shuttle from
orbital debris. ``That's a hard and fast rule.''
</P>
<P>
   The Leonid shower is predicted by experts to be the heaviest in
33 years.
</P>
<P>
   In order to avoid a collision, Discovery's mission would not
lift off after Nov. 5. The restriction allows the shuttle crew to
complete their mission with two extra days of margin if their
runways are socked in by bad weather on the scheduled return to
Earth. &QL;

BOMBING SUSPECTS ARE ISOLATED IN NEW YORK JAIL  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prison officials have cut off virtually all
communications for two men being held in Manhattan in the bombings
of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   A federal prison official said Monday that the government moved
under a rarely used federal rule that allows prison officials to
limit an inmate's contacts to prevent future ``acts of violence and
terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office declined to say
whether the authorities foresaw further threats of terrorism. But
the law allows officials to impose restrictions where they believe
there is ``a substantial risk'' that an inmate's communications
``could result in death or serious bodily injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the provision, approved by the Justice Department, prison
officials may segregate prisoners from other inmates, and cut off
their correspondence, visits, interviews with the news media and
use of the telephone. It was not clear yesterday which of these
restrictions would be applied to the two bombing suspects, Mohamed
Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali. The rule does
permit communications with their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   A Bureau of Prisons official in Washington confirmed that the
two men are joining a group of about six inmates throughout the
country being held under the restrictions. The total population of
federal prisons exceeds 108,000 inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Others similarly restricted include Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the
Egyptian cleric convicted in the conspiracy to blow up landmarks in
New York, and Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, convicted of masterminding the
World Trade Center bombings in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Michael A. Young, the lawyer representing Odeh, said he was
``somewhat concerned because these are pretrial defendants, after
all.'' ``You can't punish them in advance of any determination of
whether they are guilty or innocent,'' he said. Leonard F. Joy,
al-'Owhali's lawyer, said his initial impression is that some of
the restrictions could hinder his ability to represent his client.

WHILE GLENN GETS GLORY FOR SPACEFLIGHT, NASA CARRIES BURDEN OVER
HIS SAFETY 
 
 
By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ John Glenn gets the glory for taking his
77-year-old body back into space. NASA shoulders the grief over his
safety and physical well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Both hope the scales of risk and reward will balance by placing
the often overlooked research that NASA conducts in space in the
media spotlight surrounding the aging Mercury astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't make this the John Glenn flight. You all make this
the John Glenn flight,'' Discovery commander Curt Brown said. ``Our
job is to go up, do research and make the shuttle flights efficient
and safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown and his crew arrived at the Kennedy Space Center in
Florida Monday as the countdown began for the medical research
mission scheduled to lift off at 1 p.m. CDT on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 3,500 requests for credentials to cover the
launch, a total that surpasses such events as the first Apollo moon
voyage and the first shuttle launch after the Challenger disaster.
</P>
<P>
   From the major broadcast and cable news networks to the History
Channel, Glenn and his 1962 landmark orbital flight are premium
programming.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1986 Challenger accident attests, NASA administrator Dan
Goldin's decision in January to launch a senior citizen of Glenn's
stature as part of the agency's 40th anniversary celebration was a
roll of the dice.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio senator's safety is the linchpin behind the success of
the unusual venture.
</P>
<P>
   The Challenger tragedy claimed the lives of seven astronauts,
among them New Hampshire schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe. The
deaths plunged the nation into a prolonged period of reassessment
over the inherent risks of its space program and its goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make the shuttle as safe as possible, but there is always a
finite risk,'' Goldin acknowledged. ``(Glenn is) going into space
at 77 because deep down in his inner being he feels the rewards of
going to space are worth the potential risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn addressed the issue when NASA honored his request to fly
as a subject in a range experiments that will attempt to link the
stresses of spaceflight to the natural aging process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly have a lot of confidence in this thing, or I would
not be volunteering to go,'' Glenn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a time when we thought the emphasis on
safety was a little less than it should have been, but those days
are behind us,'' he said. ``The track record is there for everyone
to look at how that danger has been dealt with since Challenger,
and I think NASA has done an outstanding job.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's flight will be the 92nd for the shuttle, the 67th since
Challenger.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle's safety margin has improved greatly in recent
years, largely because of safety modifications to the shuttle's
primary rocket engines.
</P>
<P>
   The median probability of a catastrophic accident during liftoff
is currently one in 438, improved from one in 120 in 1989, said
NASA spokeswoman Jennifer McCarter. Meanwhile, the probability of
catastrophe throughout a mission from liftoff to landing is
currently one in 233.
</P>
<P>
   With less fanfare, the space agency has also looked at the
health risk to Glenn, which is higher than for a younger astronaut,
though NASA will not quantify by how much
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Glenn's flight, it added a portable defibrillator to
the shuttle's medical kit and drugs that can be administered if
there is a heart-stopping allergic reaction during one of the
mission's experiments.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dave Williams, the physician-astronaut who serves
as NASA's director of life sciences, Glenn met all of the
cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological qualifications to fly
as well as the hearing and vision requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned about being able to take the rigors of space
physically,'' said Glenn. ``I think that is something I will be
able to do quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   Physician-astronaut Scott Parazynski, an emergency medicine
specialist, will serve as Discovery's medical officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is a considerable risk, but regardless we
just have to be prepared,'' said Parazynski. ``We are flying a
considerable amount of capability. It's not like being in an
emergency room, things just take longer in (the weightlessness) of
space.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of any crew member who became ill or injured, the
shuttle's medical officer would first attempt to stabilize his
patient's condition, treat it if possible or prepare for an
emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   The situation aboard the orbiting spacecraft would be discussed
between the shuttle's commander and the flight surgeon in mission
control. Shuttle managers would decide if an emergency landing was
warranted.
</P>
<P>
   The re-entry and landing would require about six hours,
according to Parazynski.
</P>
<P>
   The procedures and precautions in place at NASA before Glenn's
launch were sufficient, said Phil Engelhauf, mission control's lead
flight director for Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA has addressed that issue and acknowledged the fact there
is a slight increase in risk for an older person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he contends it's equivalent to the risk Glenn faces when he
exerts himself in a similar fashion on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do everything we can to minimize risk,'' said Engelhauf.
``We have reviewed all the procedures and practices to see if there
is anything we could do or should do to protect the individual in
that age bracket any better than we do right now. We have not come
up with anything.'' &QL;

   BRASILIA, Brazil _ In an emotional ceremony that officially ends
a bitter conflict that spanned generations, the presidents of Peru
and Ecuador signed a peace treaty here Monday to open their borders
and create avenues for trade and development.
</P>
<P>
   Coming weeks after the two countries had nearly stumbled back
into war, the treaty relies on four guarantor nations to outline
the two nations' borders.
</P>
<P>
   Blocked in a stalemate over the ill-defined line, the presidents
of Ecuador and Peru asked President Clinton and President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso of Brazil to settle the dispute. In addition to
Brazil and the United States, the other guarantors are Chile and
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must continue to free ourselves of our prejudices, to
overcome traumas that have been generated over more than half a
century,'' President Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the accord Ecuador gains the use of a square kilometer of
Peruvian territory at Tiwinza, atop the Condor Mountains, where it
will build a monument to its war dead. Though under Peruvian
sovereignty, the territory will remain under Ecuadorean control.
</P>
<P>
   Tiwinza was the site of the last Ecuadorean holdout against Peru
in 1995, and 12 Ecuadorean soldiers are believed to be buried
there.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador will also gain access to the Amazon River and the right
to build two ports in Peru. Sweetening the peace were accords on
navigation, trade and development that will release $3 billion of
aid to the region.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries plan to link electrical grids and have agreed
that Ecuador may instead turn to an underused Peruvian pipeline.

DEATH RATE ON U.S. ROADS IS REPORTED AT A RECORD LOW
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The death rate on the nation's roads fell to a
record low last year, the government said on Monday, after
re-calculating travel statistics. The total number of deaths
changed hardly at all, but the death rate fell because of the
relentless increase in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Yet transportation experts said the traffic-death rate for the
elderly is rising rapidly. A person older than 74 is more than
twice as likely to die in a motor vehicle crash than a younger
person, according to the National Safety Council, a nonprofit group
sponsored mostly by the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   For most people, though, the risk of death or serious injury is
falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a downward trend in all the categories,'' said Charles
Hurley, a spokesman for the safety council. ``Fatal injuries become
nonfatal, serious injuries become nonserious.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurley said that accident rates usually rose during periods of
economic expansion because prosperity stimulated more driving, but
that the death rate per 100,000 people had been falling for the
last three years because other factors were moving faster: an
increase in seat belt use, a decline in drunken driving and an
improvement in cars.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Martinez, administrator of the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, said the improvement came despite an
increase in elderly drivers, who are more likely to be frail and to
have trouble coping with traffic, and in teen-age drivers, who have
high accident rates.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic safety agency, part of the Transportation
Department, said there were 1.6 deaths per 100 million miles
traveled, based on a higher estimate of total miles driven in 1997
than the agency had used this summer, when it said the death rate
had not changed.
</P>
<P>
   The rate was 1.7 deaths per 100 million miles traveled the year
before. The 1997 figure is the lowest since the agency began
keeping records 30 years ago. And the National Safety Council said
on Monday that 16.1 traffic fatalities per 100,000 people was also
at a historic low, tying a record set in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, 41,967 people were killed by motor vehicles last year,
including 5,700 pedestrians and 700 bicycle riders. An additional
3.4 million people were injured in 2.2 million crashes. And 4.6
million crashes reported to police did not involve injury.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in deaths comes despite the loosening of the
55-mile-per-hour national speed limit 11 years ago, and its
elimination in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic congestion and total miles driven have gone up too, but
that helps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congestion has a positive effect on highway safety,'' Hurley
said, ``because it drives speeds down.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that there would be more highway repair in the next
few years, leading to new safety problems.
</P>
<P>
   According to the safety council, the number of motor-vehicle
deaths per 100,000 people is declining for all age groups except
the elderly. The death rate for the elderly last year, measured
against miles traveled, was just over double the rate for the
population as a whole, 32.7 per 100,000 population vs. 16.1 for all
age groups. The rate for people 75 and older is the highest since
1973.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said that elderly people were more mobile than they
used to be, but that they were much more fragile than other
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A side impact, with forces straight to pelvis and chest, can
be devastating,'' said Martinez, a former emergency room physician.
``In a younger person wearing restraints in a serious crash, they
may have some broken ribs, but with an elderly person, the chest
being much more delicate, those same rib fractures can lead to
problems with lungs, and eventually, a fatality.''
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said in a telephone
interview that his department was looking into a number of
remedies, including signs that are easier for older people to see.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether states should be encouraged to re-test older
drivers, Slater said: ``There is probably the need for all of us to
have refresher courses in some way. If that occurs, I think it
would be much better to do it across the board rather than to
single out older drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Slater added that the budget Congress passed last week had a 10
percent increase for highway safety programs.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said that the issue of screening older drivers to test
their road competence was extremely sensitive, but that safety
officials should frame the question differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Screening for fit-to-drive is no different from screening for
cancers or heart disease,'' he said. ``We have to make sure it's
safe.''

PIAZZA EMBRACES THE CHALLENGE (AND POTENTIAL REWARDS) OF PLAYING IN
NEW YORK  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Acknowledging that he had become more and more
comfortable as a Met last season, Mike Piazza said Monday he
decided to remain with the team because of the challenge and
potential rewards of playing in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old catcher, who agreed to a record contract worth
$91 million over the weekend, appeared at a news conference at Shea
Stadium and openly proclaimed his desire to succeed amid the
pressure that accompanies a career in this city.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked inside, I realized this is where I wanted to
be,'' Piazza said. ``When you're not successful here, it's tough.
But when you win here, it's twice as good as anyplace else.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if I happen to be so fortunate to go in the Hall of Fame,
it's definitely going to be in a Mets uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments reflected a turnaround from late summer, when he
appeared bothered and subdued after being booed by fans for not
producing with runners on base. But he said he became convinced
that the flip side of this reaction would be an embrace by the fans
and the city that could not be equaled elsewhere. ``When I realized
what had transpired with the Dodgers, I knew that no matter where I
went, it would have been the same,'' Piazza said. ``And I just felt
I might as well get booed by the best. Going somewhere else - with
no offense to any other place - would be a letdown. When you come
here, you get infected by the attitude. And you always know where
you stand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, meanwhile, are convinced that they have secured the
cornerstone of their franchise into the next century as they try to
build their first World Series winner since 1986. They introduced
Piazza on the same day they acknowledged they would raise ticket
prices for next season - in all probability by more than the 20
percent they raised them before last season.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday _ the team's co-owners _ said
the increase was not solely due to the new contract for Piazza. But
they said they had given General Manager Steve Phillips the
go-ahead to significantly expand the team's payroll beyond the $57
million figure for 1998 _ the sixth highest in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Including Piazza's signing, the Mets have committed $40 million
to 10 players for 1999. That list includes Todd Hundley, who will
make $5.3 million, but who is certain to be traded in the wake of
Piazza's signing. But it doesn't include a new contract for Al
Leiter, the pitcher who is expected to sign a four-year $32 million
deal in the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   At an average of $13 million a season, Piazza's contract is the
richest in baseball, surpassing the $12.5 million the Red Sox are
paying pitcher Pedro Martinez. It also includes a limited no-trade
agreement, something the Los Angeles Dodgers refused to provide
when Piazza turned down what his agent said was a six-year offer
for $79 million earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers traded Piazza to the Florida Marlins on May 15, and
a week later the Mets acquired him for three minor leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Piazza is usually guarded when discussing
himself. But Monday he was relaxed, open, even forthright when he
spoke of his reasons for staying - even though he had been booed at
Shea during a good part of the year. ``I know it's not going to be
easy,'' Piazza said. But at least he knows what he is in for after
signing the most lucrative contract in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who have won 88 games the last two seasons, were
eliminated from playoff contention on the final day of this past
season after losing five consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Re-signing Piazza and Leiter, their top pitcher, appear to be
just the beginning of a strategy in which the Mets could have a
new/old left fielder named Bobby Bonilla hitting behind Piazza in
the lineup (something Wilpon hinted strongly was going to happen);
plus another power-hitting corner outfielder and either a new
second baseman or third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   That means that Carlos Baerga is almost surely gone.
Furthermore, by re-signing Piazza, Hundley is sure to be traded.
And so the Mets are now in the market for some more free agents,
maybe even another pitcher or two.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no question that Phillips had already pulled off
perhaps the most important free agent signing in the team's 37-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza - who has shaved his mustache for what he called an
incognito look for the off-season - called his signing, ``an easy
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Over his first six seasons in the majors, Piazza has already put
up some Hall of Fame-type numbers: a .333 batting average, 200 home
runs, 644 runs batted in. He is one of the most fearsome
right-handed hitters in the game and surely its best hitting
catcher. Last season, he finished fourth in the National League in
hitting with a .329 average. For the Mets, he batted .348 with 23
homers and 76 runs batted in, in just 109 games.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Phillips called Monday, ``a momentous day in New
York Mets history.'' And with Piazza in the fold, Phillips said the
Mets now have the identity _ and the marquee player _ they were
sorely lacking heading into last season. Not to mention some
renewed ``credibility in our fans' eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   To show how badly the Mets wanted to sign Piazza, they came to
an agreement with him in three days, beginning last Wednesday,
after going nearly five months without having any kind of contract
discussions. There is some question as to whether the Mets were
essentially bidding against themselves, although Piazza's agent,
Dan Lozano, said Monday that he thought he could have gotten Piazza
more money elsewhere. But Lozano did admit that the Mets actually
upped their initial offer from their first proposal last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason we wanted to do it as quickly as we did is
that we didn't want him out on the market,'' Wilpon said. ``We
didn't want to take the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lozano: ``I didn't expect it to get done as quickly as it
did. Not a contract of this magnitude.'' Lozano went on to describe
his past dealings with the Dodgers as akin to pulling teeth.
Piazza, he said, had become disenchanted with how the team handled
its negotiations with his best friend, Eric Karros, in the last
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza said it was simply time to turn the page on his Dodger
career. Whether he is able to catch for the next seven years is
another question, however. And Phillips indicated Monday that at
some point, Piazza could move to first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's actually guaranteed us that he wouldn't get hurt for
the seven years,'' Phillips said with a smile. ``There is a history
with catchers that their offensive performances can decline. But
none of those other catchers is Mike Piazza. So I'm not concerned
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   And right now, about the only thing Piazza is concerned about is
finding a place to live in New York.

THREE-MEMBER R.E.M. TURNS IN VERY DIFFERENT DISC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ And then there were three.
</P>
<P>
   R.E.M.'s first album without drummer Bill Berry is due today,
and the introspective, brooding record presents many challenges for
the beloved Georgia band and its followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up'' (Warner Bros.), the band's 11th studio album, reveals an
R.E.M. with a very different dynamic than the one evident on such
early-'90s best sellers as ``Out of Time'' and ``Automatic for the
People.'' Since the remaining members _ Michael Stipe, Peter Buck
and Mike Mills _ didn't have a drummer, couldn't rehearse and
decided early on that nobody would play their usual instruments,
the album is R.E.M.'s most experimental effort yet, certainly more
so than the song-oriented previous disc, ``New Adventures in
Hi-Fi.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry was really the third departure since 1996 of a key figure
surrounding the group. First, manager Jefferson Holt bolted under
mysterious circumstances, followed by longtime producer and ``fifth
member'' Scott Litt, who launched a record label of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last October, after 17 years as drummer, harmony singer,
songwriter and sometime bassist, Berry got off the merry-go-round.
</P>
<P>
   You can call it an ``Up''-heaval. The band members certainly see
it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an enormous seismic shift for us,'' Stipe, 38, said.
``For Bill, it was a relief, but it made the process, which is
already difficult, even more so. What started out as an
experimental record got more experimental.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck gives a little more detail about Berry's state of mind. The
40-year-old drummer had survived a life-threatening fever in
Germany in 1989 and a brain hemorrhage in Switzerland in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was unhappy with the travel, and all the strange
places took the enjoyment out of it for him,'' Buck said. ``It
turned out that every single thing about the band had become
stressful for him. Bill didn't want to leave Georgia. The things
that the rest of us feel are perks of the job _ traveling, eating
strange food, visiting foreign cultures _ Bill's not that type of
guy. He wants food like he gets it in Georgia. He wants to sleep in
his own bed. I never imagined this would happen to any of us.''
</P>
<P>
   To start the album, Buck brought in his collection of keyboard
artifacts from the '70s: play-along home organs, Moog and ARP
synthesizers, and something called the Kitten, ``stuff I'd never
heard of,'' Mills says.
</P>
<P>
   The creaky yet somehow charming technology of the disco decade
tied in with '90s studio tricks such as looping, sampling and eerie
reverb effects. Drummer Barrett Martin of Screaming Trees and
Buck's instrumental side project Tuatara was hired to play vibes
and stand-up bass. Strange percussion from all over the world was
overdubbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process made it interesting for us,'' bassist Mills, 39,
said. ``I played guitar, 14 different keyboards. It was a lot of
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The members of R.E.M. have no plans to tour for ``Up,'' but the
band _ augmented by backup musicians _ will do some TV dates,
including ``Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' and ``Rosie O'Donnell''
next month as well as an appearance on ``Sesame Street'' in
January. At 9 p.m. Wednesday, MTV will broadcast an hourlong R.E.M.
concert taped last week at New York's Bowery Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most bands our age go out and celebrate their history by
playing their hits,'' Buck, 41, said. ``I really have no interest
in doing that. I'm just not ready to be an oldies, greatest-hits
act. I've seen it happen with the Who, the Stones. I'd rather not
tour at all and just make records. I don't know how to come to
terms with it.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, seven years after the band went to No. 4 in the
top-40 with ``Losing My Religion,'' R.E.M. has a diminished fan
base. Last year's ``New Adventures,'' recorded mostly at
soundchecks and on stage during the grueling 1995 ``Monster'' world
tour, took care of that by selling 5 million copies worldwide,
approximately 5 million fewer than the two R.E.M. discs that
preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite lavish praise for the moody and often beautiful album,
``New Adventures'' burned off 50 percent of R.E.M.'s global
audience, possibly due to Patti Smith's choice of an introductory
single, the ethereal, five-minute dirge ``E-Bow the Letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck says that choice ``killed the record stone dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the previous album, the 75-minute ``Up'' requires repeated
listenings to ``get'' the melodies, lyrics and the disc's ambient,
blurred mood.
</P>
<P>
   Even more worrying is the music-biz belief that the majority of
record buyers today are 15 years old and younger, with the patience
and musical acumen of gnats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the length is going to be a problem,'' said Denise
Sullivan, author of the oral history ``R.E.M.: Talk About the
Passion'' (Da Capo Press; $14.95). ``Traditionally, R.E.M. records
have taken a long time to sink in. I've never liked one on the
first listen. My guess is kids today won't want to listen to
something so many times. But on the other hand, this is adult
music, music being made by men who are around 40 years old. It's
not designed for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills, for one, says the audience deserves what it gets if it
doesn't want to invest the time it may take to understand and
appreciate the band's new music.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't want something that they might need to hear more
than once, let them listen to Celine Dion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1980 in Athens, Ga., R.E.M. marked the moment when
post-punk morphed into alternative-rock. In '81, the quartet's
first single, ``Radio Free Europe,'' sparked a back-to-basics
movement in American rock. With its ringing guitars, Stipe's
mumbled, cryptic lyrics and a do-it-yourself aesthetic borrowed
from punk rock, the band sounded at once traditional and modern.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, thanks to albums like the 1987 commercial
breakthrough ``Document,'' with its unexpected top-10 single, ``The
One I Love,'' R.E.M. moved from cult status to alt-rock
groundbreakers to become one of the world's most popular bands with
a string of chart hits that include ``Shiny Happy People,'' ``Man
on the Moon,'' ``Everybody Hurts'' and ``What's the Frequency,
Kenneth?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite many years in the music business, Buck, who lives in
Seattle with his wife and 4-year-old twin daughters, still
considers himself a fan first and foremost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when rock 'n' roll was the last bastion of
something that meant something,'' he said. ``Now, you see rock
bands with choreography. I remember when the only time you read
about the Rolling Stones in the paper was when they got arrested.
Music still means a lot to me. I take things away that ennoble me _
free jazz, for example. I walk away with my head on fire. Rock 'n'
roll has become catchy love ballads. I'm feeling more and more that
I don't fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   With a newly renegotiated recording contract worth $80 million,
R.E.M. left the crucial choice of a first single off ``Up'' to the
label this time. The result: ``Daysleeper,'' one of just two songs
here that sound like the ``old'' jangly-guitar R.E.M. In it, Stipe
adopts the voice of a resigned night-shift worker.
</P>
<P>
   Other memorable tracks include ``At My Most Beautiful,'' a
lovely, strings-sweetened ballad with luminous harmonies that owes
much to Brian Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started as a simple piano piece, and when I was in L.A.
last summer I wrote the first line,'' said Stipe, who is
co-executive producer of the glam-rock film ``Velvet Goldmine,''
opening Nov. 6. ``It took all of a year to fill out the rest of the
song. I wanted to write a straightforward love song without getting
sappy, without employing irony and cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't hear well-written love songs these days.''

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Product Manager Jeff Groudan and Engineering Manager
Greg Mora were on the same development team for the same laptop PC
at Compaq Computer Corp. three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But just because they were working together doesn't mean they
saw each other that much.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, they communicated by telephone and e-mail. Getting
together meant one of them had to hike across much of Compaq's
240-acre campus in northwest Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a 10-minute walk across campus just to do a
face-to-face,'' said Groudan. ``It was a real inconvenience, and it
meant there was less focus for the team than there should have
been.''
</P>
<P>
   Was that any way to build a notebook computer? Compaq's
managers, looking at declining sales and quality complaints from
customers, decided it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Mora and Groudan work in the same building, just a few
steps from each other. In a business usually thought of as relying
on electronic communications such as e-mail, something as simple as
being in the same place has a renewed value.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing the team together is just one thing Compaq has done in
an attempt to turn its troubled notebook business around. And it
appears to have worked.
</P>
<P>
   While Compaq has not yet regained its No. 1 position in the
portable computer market, an honor long held by rival Toshiba,
analysts say Compaq has started to rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Quality problems are down. Sales have increased. And Compaq has
won back some customers who walked away for a variety of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq employees and executives have been uncharacteristically
blunt about the quality of its notebook computers during the
1995-96 era. Many of its portable PCs purchased by customers in
that time frame did not work and were ``dead on arrival.'' This was
particularly true of the Armada 4000 thin-and-light notebook, and
the LTE 5000, the company's flagship portable.
</P>
<P>
   The Gartner Group, a market research firm based in Stamford,
Conn., early last year warned buyers to avoid the Armada 4100, and
issued a ``buy with caution'' rating for the LTE 5000.
</P>
<P>
   Engineer Mora said the problems stemmed from the fact that
Compaq's notebook division was ``in a state of flux'' and seemed to
lack direction.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that hiring Inventec, a Taiwanese computer
manufacturer, to build the high-end LTE 5000 proved troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had missed being among the first out of the gate with a
mobile Pentium notebook,'' said product manager Groudan. ``As part
of our recovery, we kicked off the LTE 5000 effort, and decided to
go with Inventec. It was the first time in five years that we did
not build a notebook computer ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The LTE 5000 was an ambitiously designed notebook, the first to
use a lithium-ion battery and have a built-in AC adapter. As a
result, Mora said, getting things right in a factory Compaq didn't
own ``was a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq pulled off a major sales coup when Microsoft Corp.
decided to buy LTE 5000s exclusively for use by its sales force.
The notebook was prominently featured in several booths at the
Redmond, Wash., launch party for Windows 95 in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But that pride turned into embarrassment when Microsoft had
enough problems with the notebooks that it switched to Toshiba as
its prime supplier, Mora said.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Compaq was not alone in its problems. According to
the May 1997 Gartner Group report that warned buyers away from
Compaq, the entire notebook category was troubled. For example,
Apple Computer had to retool its PowerBook line because some models
were prone to catching on fire.
</P>
<P>
   The report blamed computer companies' rush to keep up with
rapidly advancing technologies and cutthroat competition. Design
and production were being rushed, resulting in slapdash products.
</P>
<P>
   The notebook computer market is both fast-growing and lucrative.
But the very things that make it lucrative also make it difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Notebook computers are not designed in the same way as desktop
PCs, which have a standard architecture. Desktops have a main
system board, called the motherboard, with slots into which various
kinds of expansion cards, memory chips and other enhancements can
be added.
</P>
<P>
   The slots are standard in design, which makes it easy to design
a desktop PC. If you want to include a feature, just drop in the
appropriate card.
</P>
<P>
   But notebooks are different. There are not as many design
standards _ for example, the memory chips that fit in one model
usually won't fit in another. Each manufacturer uses a different
keyboard layout. There are several kinds of pointing devices,
screen types and removable drive bays.
</P>
<P>
   Different companies take different approaches to design. Dell
Computer, for instance, doesn't include built-in modems in its
notebooks, allowing customers to choose their own modem types that
slip into a PC-card slot in the side of the machine. Compaq, on the
other hand, offers built-in modems as an option, but buyers can
still opt to use a PC-card model if they prefer.
</P>
<P>
   Because there are fewer standards, companies that build
notebooks must put more research and development into advances in
miniaturization and other aspects of design. Although the notebook
market is growing, it remains much smaller than desktops. Because
fewer portables are sold, manufacturers also don't get the volume
parts discounts from suppliers that can be had in the desktop
business.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, notebook prices are much higher than those of
comparably equipped desktops _ manufacturers must charge more in
order to recoup their investments.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, companies such as Compaq must keep up with constant
changes in various technologies, ranging from screens to processors
to communications. Notebooks have a shelf life of about 12 to 18
months before their overall designs are considered ``stale,''
analysts say. That gives manufacturers a narrow window in which to
sell enough notebooks to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notebook computer market is pretty hyper-competitive,
maybe even more than the server business,'' said William Conroy, an
analyst in Houston with Sanders Morris Mundy. ``And it's becoming
even more price-competitive, even though prices are still much
higher than in the desktop business.''
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba has been the market leader in notebook sales for most of
the 1990s. Compaq took the crown away briefly in the mid-1990s, but
lost it again.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Winkler, the senior vice president at Compaq who
oversees the notebook division _ and a former Toshiba executive _
has made it his goal to retake that No. 1 position. He has hired
new managers who have made changes in the structure of Compaq's
notebook teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of focus on the internal efficiencies of
the organization,'' said Randy Guisto, an analyst with Framingham,
Mass.-based International Data Corp. ``It's been a two-year
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most visible changes was to bring together in one
place the people working on specific models. Mora and Groudan, for
example, were moved into one building when they began work on the
Armada 1500, a low-end notebook that was introduced last year.
</P>
<P>
   Chet Pribonic, the vice president for Compaq's portables
division, said it was his idea to bring the teams together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been going around the campus trying to understand where
all the work was being done,'' he said. ``It struck me pretty
quickly that there wasn't one place you could go for a given
project to find out about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The process of bringing together people involved in the same
project even has its own management-jargon buzzword: co-location.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty common scenario,'' Pribonic said. ``Co-location
aids communication and creates this strong teamed environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously, engineers worked in one building, while marketing
executives were in another. Pribonic brought the 50 to 60
engineers, marketing and operations people working on the Armada
1500 into the same building, which was no small feat logistically.
Those who were not part of the team had to be relocated to new
offices on the overcrowded Compaq campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are together, you have a more functional allegiance
to the product you're working on,'' said Groudan, the product
manager. ``It made for a great attitudinal change.''
</P>
<P>
   The same approach was later applied to a successor of the LTE
5000, the flagship Armada 7800. Eventually, members of all the
teams working on individual notebook lines were co-located.
</P>
<P>
   Pribonic now gets invitations from other Compaq divisions,
asking him to speak at group meetings to talk about his approach.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Clark, marketing vice president for the portables division,
said Compaq also created different kinds of notebook systems to
match different buyers in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, the Compaq portable line was disjointed,'' said
Tim Bajarin, an industry analyst with San Jose, Calif.-based
Creative Strategies. ``They didn't have a real vision, and they
didn't understand who their true users were.''
</P>
<P>
   Bajarin said Compaq has done a better job of understanding how
the portable market has grown and matured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq finally understands what its customers want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Compaq began designing its notebooks to share
parts, so that the company can get volume discounts from suppliers
that are closer to those enjoyed by the desktop division.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the changes are showing results. According to numbers
supplied by International Data Corp., Compaq has halted the
portable market share slide that began with the problems caused by
its troubled earlier models.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq had dropped to No. 3 in worldwide portables sales, behind
Toshiba and IBM, in 1997. Now, Compaq and IBM routinely battle it
out for second place. While Compaq has not gained much share, the
market for portables has grown and so the company continues to sell
more computers as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq was No. 1 in the portable market in the United States for
the first quarter of this year, though it was at a time that rival
Toshiba was having inventory problems that have since been
corrected, International Data's Guisto said. Toshiba bounded to the
top again in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most importantly, Compaq has started to win back
customers. For example, Microsoft once again is buying Compaq
notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's portables division now has the additional challenge of
integrating the notebook products it acquired in the $9 billion
purchase of Digital Equipment Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has chosen to keep only one model from Digital's line,
the HiNote Ultra, a thin-and-light model best known for a large,
bright display. It's now known as the Armada 6500, and was recently
upgraded to include a larger hard drive, faster CD-ROM drive and a
300-megahertz Pentium II chip.
</P>
<P>
   The team that designed the Digital HiNote Ultra is being kept on
and will keep working at its offices in Marlborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare that we can find a block of notebook design talent
in one place that we are able to integrate into our organization in
one fell swoop,'' Clark said. &QL;

NBC SAYS TIME IS RIGHT AS IT HIRES AN EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC officially put Scott Sassa in place Monday as the executive
who will lead the network's entertainment division in the future,
installing him as president of entertainment, replacing Warren
Littlefield, the long-time programming executive for the network.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wright, the president of NBC, also made clear the network's
plan to have Sassa replace Don Ohlmeyer, who heads NBC's
entertainment operations as president of its West Coast division,
when Ohlmeyer completes his contract in January of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The moves come at a time when NBC, the dominant network in prime
time for the past five years, has experienced a slide in its
ratings performance this season, though it still leads all its
network rivals by a wide margin. NBC is also embroiled in a dispute
with the big Hollywood studios, which have imposed a boycott on
providing new shows to NBC.
</P>
<P>
   That action is a protest against a new NBC policy demanding
either an ownership position in all new shows it programs or
contract terms of 10 years or more that would prevent NBC from
facing a renegotiation after four years, like the one that forced
NBC to pay $13 million an episode for its hit drama ``E.R.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright said the timing was right to realign its entertainment
division, bringing in Sassa and entering into a joint-venture
agreement with Littlefield to provide shows for the network from
his own company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time was the opportunity to have as orderly a management
transition as possible,'' Wright said. ``We've completed work on
the current schedule; all the new programs are in place. A lot of
the work on the spring development still has to be done. This is an
opportunity for Scott to come into a less hectic situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sassa said he intended to throw himself immediately into the
development process because ``finding hit shows is what keeps this
business going.'' He said he thought the idea of a transition year
in which he would be able to work with Ohlmeyer was an ideal
arrangement because ``in fairness, I really don't know what this
job is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Sassa's background included managing all the entertainment
operations for Turner Broadcasting, from starting the cable
entertainment channel TNT and the Cartoon Network to making the
deals to acquire the Castle Rock and New Line movie studios for
Turner and starting Turner Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've developed animated shows. I've developed television
movies. I've developed theatrical motion pictures. I've even
developed a comic book,'' Sassa said, ``But I've never developed a
network series. I'm curious to learn the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright said Sassa's ``multichannel background'' would be an
asset. ``We need a diversity of ideas,'' he said. Summing up how
the transition would work, he said: ``Scott will become Warren. Don
is Don. At some point Scott will be Don.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It was never intended that Warren continue in a
programming role all the way through his contract.'' Before he
agreed to the joint-venture deal to start his own company,
Littlefield had a management contract with NBC that extended
through 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Wright praised Littlefield, who was in place at NBC
entertainment when the network initiated many of its biggest hits _
including ``Seinfeld,'' ``Cheers'' and ``E.R.'' _ for his
programming contributions to the network. ``I'm very high on
Warren,'' Wright said. ``I've defended him when others didn't. I've
gone with Warren on a lot of decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those decisions was Littlefield's choice to select Jay
Leno to succeed Johnny Carson at the ``Tonight'' show over David
Letterman. That looked like a bad decision for two years, but Leno
has now become the dominant star in late night.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though his deepest association in the business is with Turner
and cable, Sassa said he had never disparaged the network business
as some other cable executives have. He cited the ability of
networks to deliver much bigger audiences for shows as its
continuing advantage over cable.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's situation in prime-time television is still solid, Wright
said, though he acknowledged the network's decline this season.
``We're struggling to live up to our billing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that NBC was not ready to pick up the slack from the
departure of ``Seinfeld,'' which the show's star, Jerry Seinfeld,
announced abruptly last Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been nice if Jerry had decided to give up one
more year,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the confrontation with the studios, Sassa said: ``I'm not
going to negotiate that in the newspapers. Don and I need to talk
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright said, ``I'm sure there's a solution to it, but I'm just
as sure that it isn't quite as necessary for us to be in business
with the studios as it used to be.'' He said that independent
producers had been aggressively bringing projects to NBC, ``now
that they realize they can jump ahead in line.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the producers NBC is already counting on is Littlefield.
Ohlmeyer said he wouldn't be surprised to see Littlefield's new
company come up with a show that could be on NBC's schedule as
early as next fall.

PHYSICIAN EULOGIZED AS CARING MAN WHO DEFIED TERRORISTS

 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, N.Y. _ Alan Dickison went to the funeral of Dr. Barnett
Slepian Monday afternoon carrying his two tow-haired children,
Connor, 4, and Kelsey, 2, a boy and girl whom Slepian had
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man was about children,'' he said, brandishing the two
children towards a cluster of reporters. ``This man was not about
abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   As the FBI announced a $100,000 reward in its investigation of
Slepian's slaying and the abortion clinic where he had worked vowed
to be open for business on Tuesday morning, Slepian was eulogized
Monday by a brother and a niece and, in a letter, from President
Clinton as a kind and dedicated physician who did not let threats
and protests stop him from fulfilling what he regarded as his duty
to care for women no matter what their needs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, among the hundreds of mourners who spilled out from a
suburban funeral home here, there were many patients like the
Dickison family who have resented Slepian's portrayal in television
and newspaper accounts as merely an abortion doctor. Such a
depiction, they said, was feeding into the agenda of the fierce
antagonists of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They raise the stakes and then some extremist shoots him in
the back in the middle of the night,'' said Dickison, a registered
nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, he said, was a doctor who cared for women through
pregnancy, infertility, childbirth and menopause. His murder, he
and other mourners said, has deprived the Buffalo area of a doctor
who brought hundreds of babies into the world as well as attended
to women who for medical or personal reasons could not carry an
embryo to term.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Sperduti, weeping as she walked toward the funeral home,
told how Slepian had saved his son's life by rushing to perform a
Caesarean on her when her son's umbilical cord became knotted in
the womb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God I'm not having any more children, because Slepian is
not alive to deliver them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As Slepian's coffin was taken away for burial, the FBI announced
it was offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the
capture of his killer. But law enforcement officials who spoke on
the condition of anonymity said that so far little information had
been developed about the killer _ what he or she looked like or
what car was used in the getaway.
</P>
<P>
   Ballistic tests have not yet been completed on the bullet, which
was fired by a sniper with a high-powered rifle from a wooded field
behind Slepian's suburban home.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they are proceeding on the theory that this
slaying is connected to four other sniper attacks since 1994 on
doctors who performed abortions. Three of the attacks took place in
Canada and one in Rochester, and there were injuries, though none
of those doctors was killed. The FBI and the Amherst Police
Department have spoken to Canadian investigators about Friday's
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, 52, who had a private practice here, but also was the
primary doctor at the only abortion clinic in downtown Buffalo, was
shot in the back on Friday night as he stood chatting with his
wife, Lynne, and 15-year-old son, Andrew, in the kitchen of their
Amherst home. The killer had fired his high-powered rifle at an
undraped window.
</P>
<P>
   At the same press conference, John B. Askey, the Chief of Police
of Amherst, revealed that six hours before Slepian was killed, his
wife, Lynne, had called the police to inform them of a fax from the
National Abortion Federation warning its 350 member clinics in the
United States and Canada of the possibility of impending assaults
because of the approach of Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday, known as Veterans' Day in the United States, is
Remembrance Day in Canada, and this day to remember war dead has
been embraced by anti-abortion activists as a memorial day. The
sniper shootings of the three Canadian doctors and the one American
took place in the days leading up to Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Askey said that Mrs. Slepian did not ask that a patrol car be
stationed at the house and the police did not send one. Asked if he
regretted not doing so, he said: ``I regret that Dr. Slepian is
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Buffalo GYN Womenservices, the clinic where Slepian
worked 15 to 24 hours a week performing abortions for largely poor
and low-wage clients, said Monday that they had received offers
from more than a half-dozen doctors around the country offering to
take over Slepian's duties.
</P>
<P>
   Melinda Dubois, assistant director, said she expected the
four-day-a week clinic, the only abortion clinic in western New
York, to resume operations on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many doctors that respected Bart,'' she said,
using Slepian's nickname, ``that they'd be willing to come into
this area to take care of our patients.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced in
Washington that any doctors who did volunteer to work at the clinic
would receive round-the-clock protection from the United States
Marshals' Service. The senator said marshals, assigned by John P.
McCaffry, chief of the western New York district, were being used
to assure women seeking abortions a constitutional protection. The
last time he said he could remember marshals' serving in a similar
role was during the civil rights era of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a constitutionally protected medical procedure and
there is a terrorist movement trying to make it impossible,''
Moynihan said in a telephone interview. ``And they murder people
and they have web sites that list doctors who perform abortions and
every so often a name is crossed off.''
</P>
<P>
   The funeral drew an overflow turnout that included Slepian's
patients and medical colleagues, as well as his family and friends
and a sprinkling of pro-abortion activists from as far away as
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen Amherst police officers controlled traffic and kept
reporters out, but there was no indication of a heavy police
presence to guard against a sniper.
</P>
<P>
   The Slepian family asked that the funeral be a private affair,
but Glenn Edward Murray, a friend of Slepian and his personal
lawyer, and others who attended described it afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Michael L. Feshbach, rabbi of Slepian's synagogue, Temple
Beth Am, read a letter President Clinton wrote to Mrs. Slepian and
her four children, Andrew, 15, Brian, 13, Michael 10, and Philip,
7, expressing his sympathy and condemning the slaying as a national
tragedy felt by all people who condemn violence against abortion
clinics and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian's niece, Amanda Robb, told how Slepian became like a
father to her after the death of her father, providing financial
and emotional support even as he was struggling to build his own
medical career.
</P>
<P>
   Before beginning his eulogy remembering Slepian's dedication,
his older brother, Jacob, an ear, nose and throat specialist in
Connecticut, told a story that highlighted his brother's dry sense
of humor.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled how his brother had once had a bird, perhaps a
macaw. When he learned that the bird could live to be as old as 80,
he joked that he would train the bird to deliver his eulogy. Jacob
Slepian said the bird and his brother had parted ways at some
point, but he would try to do as well as the bird would have done.

 &HT;    Players praise condition, fairness of course
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Come late Sunday afternoon at East Lake Golf Club, the
Tour Championship story will be about a PGA Tour money title, a
player-of-the-year award and a scoring champion. Until then, the
story will be about firm, fast greens and the consequences of being
ruled by them.
</P>
<P>
   Combine sun-baked surfaces with nasty Bermuda rough, and Phil
Mickelson can't see how the man who pockets $720,000 Sunday will be
drastically under par.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, it feels like a major, and I think the scores
will be similar to a major,'' Mickelson said Monday after playing
East Lake's back nine and then settling in at the chipping green.
``Definitely single digits under par, and probably 4- or 6-under
will win.''
</P>
<P>
   With the two par 5s (the fifth and 10th) converted to par 4s,
Mickelson noted, ``With a par 70, 6-under is really like
14-under.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting from above the hole at the par 3 11th, Mickelson zoomed
a ball past the hole and said, ``Wow.'' He figured the greens
already were rolling about 12 on the stimpmeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got the greens an excellent pace _ very quick _ and
the rough is extremely difficult, but I think it's set up better
than most of the majors we play, as far as fairness,'' Mickelson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sluman played the front nine and reiterated Mickelson's
respect for the greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they'd want them to get much faster,'' Sluman
said. ``I would think they'd probably want to keep them right where
they are. The place is really something special. The greens are
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Return engagement rumored
</P>
<P>
   Already there are rumors that the Tour Championship will return
to East Lake, possibly in 2000 after a revisit to Houston's
Champions Golf Club next year. Unseasonably warm weather this week
surely has not hurt East Lake's chances. The PGA Tour eventually
might settle on a regular rotation involving East Lake, Champions,
Pinehurst No. 2 and the Olympic Club.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors settle in
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the top 30 were on site for practice rounds or just
registration Monday _ Mickelson, Sluman, Jim Furyk, Bob Tway, Scott
Verplank, Tom Watson, Disney champion John Huston, Billy Mayfair
and Hal Sutton. Several players, particularly Orlando residents
such as Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara, will not arrive until today,
having played Monday in a pro-caddie tournament at Isleworth
Country Club to benefit the late Squeeky Medlen. Actually, there
were more caddies than players on site Monday, armed with yardage
books and radar guns. ... Mickelson hit a 2-iron on the par 3 18th,
which was playing 240 yards to the hole. ``I like the hole,'' he
said. ``I think it's great. I don't have any problem with it.'' ...
Watson said he decided not to play at Disney World last week,
risking his 29th position on the money list, to attend Parents' Day
for his daughter Meg at Stanford. Mark Calcavecchia Scott Hoch
Payne Stewart... The pro-am is today, starting at 9 a.m.

 &HT;    Air Force Tech grad will pilot shuttle
 &HT;    By Shannon Joyce
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A graduate of the Air Force Institute of
Technology will pilot the space shuttle carrying John Glenn back
into space Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Steven Lindsay, the pilot of the space shuttle
Discovery, graduated from the Air Force graduate school in 1990
with a master's degree in aeronautical engineering. The Air Force
test pilot became an astronaut in 1996, and flew his first mission
with NASA in November of 1997. Thursday's mission will be his first
as a pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Calico, the dean of AFIT's School of Engineering and
Lindsay's thesis advisor, said Lindsay is one of 11 AFIT graduates
who became NASA astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   The first two, Gordon Cooper and Virgil ``Gus'' Grissom, served
with Glenn in the Mercury Program. Both men earned bachelor's
degrees in aeronautical engineering from AFIT in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Guion Bluford Jr., the first black American astronaut, earned a
master's and doctorate in aeronautical engineering from AFIT.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was one of several Ohio legislators who fought to keep
AFIT open after it was left out of the president's 1998 budget.
Since then, the Pentagon has restored AFIT's funding and included
the graduate school in its long-term plans, AFIT Commandant Col.
John Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``AFIT has a long history of key involvement in astronautics and
aeronautics,'' Calico said.
</P>
<P>
   Calico attended Lindsay's first launch in 1997, and said he will
attend this week's as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen rocket launches and things before,'' Calico said.
``But it's a very emotional thing to know there's a human being in
there.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Security blanket imposing
 &HT;    By Jeff Bruce
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENNEDY SPACE CENTER _ The Heckler &AMP; Koch MP 5 is the assault
weapon of choice for the FBI and other federal law enforcement
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   So it shouldn't have been a big surprise to see the guards along
the tarmac carrying them, once you got past the idea of guards
carrying assault weapons, that is.
</P>
<P>
   They take their security pretty seriously hereabouts. There's a
dress code, too.
</P>
<P>
   No shorts. No open-toed shoes, No dresses. I saw at least two
photographers evicted from press buses for improper attire. NASA
officials offered standby dungarees to cover those unsightly bare
legs.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever explained why slacks, not shorts. But I had been
forewarned and was suitably attired in Dockers, thank you very
much.
</P>
<P>
   But while I was ready for dress-code inspection, I was taken by
surprise by the bomb sniffing dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Enroute to witness the arrival of the astronauts at the space
center, reporters and photographers making the trek by bus to the
runway first had their camera bags and briefcases sniffed by the
Canine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please set your bags on the curb and step away,'' ordered the
NASA security officer, attired in the black-on-black uniform so
popular with SWAT teams and F.B.I. snipers.
</P>
<P>
   Far as I know, no explosives or firearms were found. But just in
case someone snuck something into the viewing area, the guards were
ready, submachine guns slung at their sides.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there's a rule about eating on the runway, too. No FODs
allowed. And FOD, in case you haven't kept up, stands for Foreign
Object Debris. FOD is bad around jet aircraft. And we all hate
litter anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out the security fears were unwarranted. After an hour's
delay, the four T-38 jet trainers carrying all but one of the crew
of the Discovery arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures were taken. Sound bites recorded. And we all sang a
rousing Happy Birthday to astronaut Stephen Robinson, who turned 43
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the guards might have been within their rights to
shoot a couple of the photographers. You've never heard birthday
greetings delivered so off key.
</P>
<P>
   Brief hellos exchanged, the astronauts shuffled away. John
Glenn, having expressed his pleasure at all the attention the space
program is getting these days, got a welcome hug from his wife,
Annie, on the runway. And then they were gone.
</P>
<P>
   For the next few days the astronauts will begin their final
preparations for the 25th launch of the Space Shuttle Discovery.
Countdown began at 8 a.m. Monday and liftoff is scheduled for 2
p.m. Thursday, weather permitting.
</P>
<P>
   With Hurricane Mitch churning in the Caribbean southwest of
here, that's become a part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Weather officer Ed Priselac said there was a 40 percent chance
Thursday's launch could be scrubbed. That, of course, means there's
a 60 percent chance it won't.
</P>
<P>
   So, how do you figure the odds, Ed, I asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he replied ``we've never scrubbed a launch with a 40
percent forecast before. At least not during my time.''
</P>
<P>
   And how long would that be, Ed?
</P>
<P>
   ``The last 60 launches.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that's the voice of experience.

 &HT;    Mitch may become factor closer to launch
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. _ Their training all but over, John
Glenn and his crewmates arrived here Monday to begin final
preparations for their nine-day space shuttle mission while the
space agency's weather experts kept an eye on a powerful hurricane
far to the south.
</P>
<P>
   NASA managers expressed some concern that Hurricane Mitch,
churning 180-mile-per-hour winds east of the Nicaraguan border,
might turn north and affect Florida's weather. Ed Priselac ,
shuttle weather officer, said there was a 40 percent chance of a
launch delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the near term we're not concerned. When we get into the
weekend and beyond, there is some concern,'' Priselac said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA needs good weather not just to launch the shuttle, but in
case an emergency forces the orbiter to abort the flight, drop its
two booster rockets and external tank, and glide back to a landing
on the space center's shuttle landing strip. Priselac said orbiters
are limited to a maximum crosswind of about 17 miles per hour when
they land.
</P>
<P>
   Severe weather could force NASA to roll the shuttle back from
its launch pad to the shelter of the mammoth vehicle assembly
building. But that poses a double problem: the space agency has two
space shuttles on launch pads _ Discovery and Endeavor, scheduled
for launch on Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Test director Doug Lyons said the launch crew would have to roll
them back in one at a time. But he said it was unlikely to be
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Weather delays could quickly complicate Discovery's launch
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's launch could be delayed for about two hours before
being pushed back to Friday. But a delay from Friday would force
the crew to ``stand down'' until Tuesday, test director Doug Lyons
said, while some consumable items on the shuttle are replenished.
If the launch is held up then and on Wednesday, NASA could be
forced to keep the shuttle on the ground to wait out another kind
of weather _ a meteor storm.
</P>
<P>
   The earth will pass through a swarm of space rocks on Nov. 17,
an annual event known as the Leonid Meteor Showers. Scientists
expect this to be the heaviest deluge in 30 years. Satellite
operators are worried about potential meteor damage, and Lyons said
NASA has decided not to put a shuttle at risk by having one in
orbit during the storm.
</P>
<P>
   A faulty sensor on one of the shuttle's main engines won't hold
up the launch, Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   Mounted in Discovery's tail, the engines can be swiveled by the
guidance system to steer the shuttle. A few minutes before launch,
the engines are swung into position for blastoff.
</P>
<P>
   The sensor checks to be sure the engine is in the correct
position. Lyons said the launch team had other ways to check the
engine's position and decided not to replace the sensor, which
would have taken about a week.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Discovery crew flew from the Johnson Space Center
in Houston, Texas, in traditional astronaut style, flying
supersonic T-38 trainer jets. One jet developed a mechanical
problem at a refueling stop, leaving mission specialist Scott
Parazynski to catch up later.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 120 reporters and photographers watched the astronauts
land and taxi in. In one of the jets, mission specialist Stephen K.
Robinson clicked away at the press with his own camera.
</P>
<P>
   Later, mission commander Curtis L. Brown exhorted the press
crowd to join the crew in singing Happy Birthday to Robinson, who
turned 43 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure hope these guys fly better than they sing,'' Robinson
quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said, ``I've been pleasantly surprised at the outpouring
of interest in this flight, and it's really great to see people
getting so fired up about the space program again.'' NASA estimates
about 3,500 news media representatives have signed up to cover the
launch, one of its biggest turnouts for a space launch.
</P>
<P>
   Family members awaited the astronauts. Annie Glenn, who has
accompanied her husband on his training sessions in Houston,
greeted him with a kiss.

THREE-MEMBER R.E.M. TURNS IN VERY DIFFERENT DISC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ And then there were three.
</P>
<P>
   R.E.M.'s first album without drummer Bill Berry is due today,
and the introspective, brooding record presents many challenges for
the beloved Georgia band and its followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up'' (Warner Bros.), the band's 11th studio album, reveals an
R.E.M. with a very different dynamic than the one evident on such
early-'90s best sellers as ``Out of Time'' and ``Automatic for the
People.'' Since the remaining members _ Michael Stipe, Peter Buck
and Mike Mills _ didn't have a drummer, couldn't rehearse and
decided early on that nobody would play their usual instruments,
the album is R.E.M.'s most experimental effort yet, certainly more
so than the song-oriented previous disc, ``New Adventures in
Hi-Fi.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry was really the third departure since 1996 of a key figure
surrounding the group. First, manager Jefferson Holt bolted under
mysterious circumstances, followed by longtime producer and ``fifth
member'' Scott Litt, who launched a record label of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last October, after 17 years as drummer, harmony singer,
songwriter and sometime bassist, Berry got off the merry-go-round.
</P>
<P>
   You can call it an ``Up''-heaval. The band members certainly see
it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an enormous seismic shift for us,'' Stipe, 38, said.
``For Bill, it was a relief, but it made the process, which is
already difficult, even more so. What started out as an
experimental record got more experimental.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck gives a little more detail about Berry's state of mind. The
40-year-old drummer had survived a life-threatening fever in
Germany in 1989 and a brain hemorrhage in Switzerland in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was unhappy with the travel, and all the strange
places took the enjoyment out of it for him,'' Buck said. ``It
turned out that every single thing about the band had become
stressful for him. Bill didn't want to leave Georgia. The things
that the rest of us feel are perks of the job _ traveling, eating
strange food, visiting foreign cultures _ Bill's not that type of
guy. He wants food like he gets it in Georgia. He wants to sleep in
his own bed. I never imagined this would happen to any of us.''
</P>
<P>
   To start the album, Buck brought in his collection of keyboard
artifacts from the '70s: play-along home organs, Moog and ARP
synthesizers, and something called the Kitten, ``stuff I'd never
heard of,'' Mills says.
</P>
<P>
   The creaky yet somehow charming technology of the disco decade
tied in with '90s studio tricks such as looping, sampling and eerie
reverb effects. Drummer Barrett Martin of Screaming Trees and
Buck's instrumental side project Tuatara was hired to play vibes
and stand-up bass. Strange percussion from all over the world was
overdubbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process made it interesting for us,'' bassist Mills, 39,
said. ``I played guitar, 14 different keyboards. It was a lot of
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The members of R.E.M. have no plans to tour for ``Up,'' but the
band _ augmented by backup musicians _ will do some TV dates,
including ``Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' and ``Rosie O'Donnell''
next month as well as an appearance on ``Sesame Street'' in
January. At 9 p.m. Wednesday, MTV will broadcast an hourlong R.E.M.
concert taped last week at New York's Bowery Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most bands our age go out and celebrate their history by
playing their hits,'' Buck, 41, said. ``I really have no interest
in doing that. I'm just not ready to be an oldies, greatest-hits
act. I've seen it happen with the Who, the Stones. I'd rather not
tour at all and just make records. I don't know how to come to
terms with it.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, seven years after the band went to No. 4 in the
top-40 with ``Losing My Religion,'' R.E.M. has a diminished fan
base. Last year's ``New Adventures,'' recorded mostly at
soundchecks and on stage during the grueling 1995 ``Monster'' world
tour, took care of that by selling 5 million copies worldwide,
approximately 5 million fewer than the two R.E.M. discs that
preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite lavish praise for the moody and often beautiful album,
``New Adventures'' burned off 50 percent of R.E.M.'s global
audience, possibly due to Patti Smith's choice of an introductory
single, the ethereal, five-minute dirge ``E-Bow the Letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck says that choice ``killed the record stone dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the previous album, the 75-minute ``Up'' requires repeated
listenings to ``get'' the melodies, lyrics and the disc's ambient,
blurred mood.
</P>
<P>
   Even more worrying is the music-biz belief that the majority of
record buyers today are 15 years old and younger, with the patience
and musical acumen of gnats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the length is going to be a problem,'' said Denise
Sullivan, author of the oral history ``R.E.M.: Talk About the
Passion'' (Da Capo Press; $14.95). ``Traditionally, R.E.M. records
have taken a long time to sink in. I've never liked one on the
first listen. My guess is kids today won't want to listen to
something so many times. But on the other hand, this is adult
music, music being made by men who are around 40 years old. It's
not designed for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills, for one, says the audience deserves what it gets if it
doesn't want to invest the time it may take to understand and
appreciate the band's new music.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't want something that they might need to hear more
than once, let them listen to Celine Dion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1980 in Athens, Ga., R.E.M. marked the moment when
post-punk morphed into alternative-rock. In '81, the quartet's
first single, ``Radio Free Europe,'' sparked a back-to-basics
movement in American rock. With its ringing guitars, Stipe's
mumbled, cryptic lyrics and a do-it-yourself aesthetic borrowed
from punk rock, the band sounded at once traditional and modern.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, thanks to albums like the 1987 commercial
breakthrough ``Document,'' with its unexpected top-10 single, ``The
One I Love,'' R.E.M. moved from cult status to alt-rock
groundbreakers to become one of the world's most popular bands with
a string of chart hits that include ``Shiny Happy People,'' ``Man
on the Moon,'' ``Everybody Hurts'' and ``What's the Frequency,
Kenneth?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite many years in the music business, Buck, who lives in
Seattle with his wife and 4-year-old twin daughters, still
considers himself a fan first and foremost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when rock 'n' roll was the last bastion of
something that meant something,'' he said. ``Now, you see rock
bands with choreography. I remember when the only time you read
about the Rolling Stones in the paper was when they got arrested.
Music still means a lot to me. I take things away that ennoble me _
free jazz, for example. I walk away with my head on fire. Rock 'n'
roll has become catchy love ballads. I'm feeling more and more that
I don't fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   With a newly renegotiated recording contract worth $80 million,
R.E.M. left the crucial choice of a first single off ``Up'' to the
label this time. The result: ``Daysleeper,'' one of just two songs
here that sound like the ``old'' jangly-guitar R.E.M. In it, Stipe
adopts the voice of a resigned night-shift worker.
</P>
<P>
   Other memorable tracks include ``At My Most Beautiful,'' a
lovely, strings-sweetened ballad with luminous harmonies that owes
much to Brian Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started as a simple piano piece, and when I was in L.A.
last summer I wrote the first line,'' said Stipe, who is
co-executive producer of the glam-rock film ``Velvet Goldmine,''
opening Nov. 6. ``It took all of a year to fill out the rest of the
song. I wanted to write a straightforward love song without getting
sappy, without employing irony and cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't hear well-written love songs these days.''

 &HT;    Teligent brings wireless services to Austin businesses
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A new kind of telephone company is scheduled to
begin operating today in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Although it relies on wireless technology, Teligent Inc., based
in Vienna, Va. is not selling mobile telephones. Instead, it uses a
``fixed wireless network'' to sell local and long-distance voice
service as well as high-speed Internet and computer data links.
</P>
<P>
   Teligent officials said its technology will compete with
Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. for small- and medium-sized
business customers. Kirby ``Buddy'' Pickle, Teligent's president,
claimed the company could save customers more than 25 percent on
their monthly phone bills. Unlike other new challengers to Bell
monopolies, Teligent is not forced either to install a network of
fiber optic lines in dense urban areas or to lease access to
Southwestern Bell's network.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how its system is supposed to work:
</P>
<P>
   The company arranges with the owner of an office building to
install an antenna, about the size of a pizza pan, on its roof. A
fiber optic line connects the antenna to Teligent subscribers in
the building. In Austin, Pickle said, Teligent has antennas on 25
buildings in downtown and the Arboretum area of Northwest Austin.
More will be added as business grows, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A building antenna will relay telecommunication signals _ voice
calls, Internet links, high-speed computer data transfers,
videoconferencing _ to and from another antenna at a base station
antenna atop the Bank One building at 221 W. Sixth St.
</P>
<P>
   The base station is connected through a leased fiber optic line
to a Teligent switch in San Antonio. (A switch is essentially a
computer that manages telecommunications traffic.) That switch is
connected to Southwestern Bell's network, long-distance carriers
and to networks carrying Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Although local calls to and from Teligent subscribers will go
through San Antonio, no long-distance charges will apply and there
is no delay in completing the call, Teligent officials said. Pickle
said Teligent probably will install a switch in Austin next year.
</P>
<P>
   Selim Bingol, a spokesman for SBC Communications Inc., which
owns Southwestern Bell, said Teligent's arrival in Austin ``is
still more evidence that competition is here, that it's very
vigorous in Texas.'' As it tries to enter the long-distance
business, regulators and long-distance companies have claimed that
SBC hasn't done a good job opening the local phone business to
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses that drop Southwestern Bell for Teligent can keep
their telephone numbers, thanks to the 1996 federal
Telecommunications Act, enacted to promote competition in the
telephone industry.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Vanston, an Austin telecommunications consultant who is
president of Technology Futures Inc., a research company, said
Teligent could have ripe pickings among small- and medium-sized
businesses because they haven't gotten much attention from bigger
telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Teligent is the first fixed wireless company to offer local
phone service in Austin, but several other companies have built
wired networks here, mostly in the business-rich areas of downtown
and Northwest Austin, to offer a full range of telecommunications
services.
</P>
<P>
   Although only about 18 months old, Teligent made a splash early
when it lured away as its chairman Alex Mandl, the president of
AT&AMP;T Corp. who had been regarded as a serious candidate for the
chairman's office someday.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Tutterow, an analyst with KDP Investment Advisors in
Chicago, said Mandl's willingness to leave AT&AMP;T for Teligent gave
the new company a tremendous boost in credibility, helping to
attract ``all the funding they need to get the system up and
running.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickle said Teligent has raised $1.8 billion to start building
its infrastructure, and so far has spent ``several hundred
million.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, he said, Teligent expects to be
operating in 15 cities, including four in Texas: Austin, San
Antonio, Houston and Dallas. In less than three years, Pickle said,
the company should be serving 74 markets nationally.

PANEL ON IRAQ MISSILES UNCLEAR ON NERVE GAS ISSUE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A panel of international arms experts on Monday
adopted American scientific evidence indicating that Iraq had
loaded some its missiles with a deadly nerve gas known as VX.
</P>
<P>
   But their report, to the Security Council, was inconclusive
because it also left unchallenged French and Swiss tests that had
far different conclusions. The Swiss who examined samples of Iraqi
weapons in the summer said they found no evidence of poison gas.
French scientists asserted that their tests of other samples showed
only the possibility of a presence of poison gas in some Iraqi
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   What the three countries agreed on was that at some point the
Iraqis used detergents to wash missile fragments retrieved from
Iraqi desert dumps, leading to suspicion Baghdad had something to
hide.
</P>
<P>
   Because the report is indecisive, it is doubtful it will
determine policy decisions on Iraq, particularly considering the
heavy political atmosphere concerning Iraqi sanctions at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The report highlights the dispute between French and American
scientists on the methods and interpretation of the findings.
French scientists said they found what could be traces of VX or two
other deadly gases, Sarin or Soman. But they also said those traces
could be due to detergents used to cleanse the missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The United States said its scientists proved beyond any doubt
the existence of traces of the VX nerve gas in the first samples
examined in May. The United States also conducted a second set of
tests later that did not find VX; that test was ordered after Iraq
challenged that first test conducted in a military laboratory in
Aberdeen, Maryland. So of the four tests conducted only one was
assertive in making the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq charged that the United States, which led the gulf war to
evict Iraqi troops from Kuwait in 1991, was biased. That led to the
tests in France and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The 21 scientists drawn from seven countries who met here last
Thursday and Friday sidestepped the issue of which tests are to be
taken into account, asserting in Monday's report that `'all
analytical data provided by the three laboratories were again
considered as conclusive and valid.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was commissioned by the U.N. Special Commission,
charged with insuring the destruction of Baghdad's weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has admitted making a variety of chemical and biological
weapons, but did not fire them during the gulf war and continues to
insist it did not load the VX odorless nerve gas onto missiles.
UNSCOM is interested to know if Iraq has hidden any missiles that
may be loaded with VX, stressing that Iraq has still a great deal
of explaining to do before it can be given a clean bill of health.
</P>
<P>
   One of the explanations needed is why detergents were used at
all in the missiles which were then destroyed and buried by Iraq
until they were unearthed by inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The existence of VX degradation products conflicts with Iraq's
declarations that the unilaterally destroyed special warheads had
never been filled with any chemical weapons agents,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although most members of the organization doubt that Iraq has
ever told the truth about its weapons of mass destruction, many
here believe that it has gone a long way in destroying them and
that some of the sanctions should be lifted or eased in recognition
of this effort over eight years.
</P>
<P>
   In a vote highlighting widening opposition to the United States
and its frequent use of sanctions such as those imposed on Iraq,
Cuba, Libya and other countries, the U.N. General Assembly adopted
a resolution calling for the repeal of unilateral laws which affect
the economies and businesses of other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution is non-binding, but it echoes a similar vote that
called for an end to sanctions against Cuba two weeks ago. Monday's
appeal was endorsed by 80 countries from the 185 nations, with 67
abstentions. As with the Cuban vote, only the United States and
Israel voted against.
</P>
<P>
   Some Western diplomats here who spoke on condition of anonymity
have suggested that France may have held back on some of the
findings in order not to fan the flames for continued sanctions
against Iraq, although French officials categorically deny doing
so.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats here said that it is not in dispute that Iraq had
weapons of mass destruction, nor that it lied about this to the
world community. Iraq suspended armed inspections by U.N.
inspectors in August.

ELECTRONIC GLITCH STOPS TRADING FOR AN HOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To look at the trading screens of major investment
houses for a time Monday, you would have thought somebody had died.
That's because the computer system at the New York Stock Exchange
broke down, and when it did, the feverish up and down of stock
prices that is the nation's financial pulse suddenly registered as
a flatline.
</P>
<P>
   According to NYSE officials, an electronic device that transmits
stock orders from the institution's main computer to its floor
trading posts failed at 1:16 pm, bringing the exchange, the world's
largest stock market, to a grinding halt.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in the exchange's 3,090 stocks was halted for almost an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Some traders fumed that the glitch hurt their business, but the
most serious damage of the day may have been the reputation of the
exchange. The two-century-old institution prides itself on having
the most advanced and reliable technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts the respectability of the New York Stock Exchange,''
Brian Ellis, a senior trader with Loomis Sayles &AMP; Co told Bloomberg
News. ``They're in competition with the Nasdaq, and anytime they're
not trading that hurts them.''
</P>
<P>
   The NYSE is locked in a ferocious battle with the Nasdaq Stock
Market to convince companies to list their stocks with the
exchange. Despite years of prediction that the New York exchange
would eventually lose out to the more modern Nasdaq, it has
remained both the symbolic and substantive centerpiece of the
nation's financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Traders told the Associated Press that the problem was first
noticed about 12:35 p.m. when the exchange began having difficulty
posting updated trading and pricing information. That could have
resulted in some investors making trades based on outdated
information and losing money.
</P>
<P>
   While the initial problem affected only some stocks, the NYSE
was forced to halt all trading from 1:16 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. to
correct it.
</P>
<P>
   The NYSE said the computer that malfunctioned is one of eight
interconnected systems designed to back each other up and prevent a
halt in service. But the backup capabilities are designed to
function only if one of the systems failed completely. ``This piece
of equipment didn't die but became very ill,'' Anne Allen, senior
vice president of floor operations at the NYSE, told the AP.
</P>
<P>
   Exchange officials said the systems in question are old and were
close to being replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offending hardware was taken out of service today. That
equipment will be replaced overnight and we should not expect to
see similar occurrences going forward,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's problems were not the first for the Big Board. Three
years ago, computer glitches forced the exchange to delay the start
of the trading day for a full hour.
</P>
<P>
   But the NYSE is not alone; in August 1994, the Nasdaq shut down
for 34 minutes after a squirrel gnawed through a cable outside it's
Trumbell, Conn. computer center.
</P>
<P>
   After the market returned to operation, the Dow Jones
industrials ended the day closing down 20.08 points to 8432.21.
NYSE composite volume totaled 739.17 million shares.

AUTHORITIES URGE ABORTION PROVIDERS TO INCREASE SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, N.Y. _ Federal marshals alerted abortion providers
across the country Monday to beef up their personal security, as
the assassin of a provider here remained free and radical foes of
abortion rights refused to renounce further acts of deadly
violence.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Barnett A. Slepian was buried, three days after a sniper
murdered him in his kitchen, investigators in the United States and
Canada hunted for clues to whether the physician's killer is a
rogue terrorist or part of an armed movement aimed at harming and
intimidating abortion providers.
</P>
<P>
   The massive search unfolded as security specialists reported
that acts of serious violence against abortion clinics and
providers are escalating and radical antiabortion activists
predicted that the trend will persist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know for a fact that it will continue until Roe v. Wade is
reversed,'' said Jonathan O'Toole, a member of the Creator's Rights
Party, which has defended violence against Slepian and other
abortion providers as morally justifiable.
</P>
<P>
   O'Toole, in a telephone interview from the party's headquarters
in Georgia, compared Slepian's killer to the militant abolitionist
John Brown. ``Just as John Brown used violence to try to protect
people who had been declared three-fifths human by the US Supreme
Court,'' O'Toole said, ``the analogy applies to anyone who would
take it upon themselves to defend the lives of the unborn.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said Monday the Slepian murder investigation will
determine what role, if any, the Creator's Rights Party played in
the circumstances leading to the slaying. The party's Internet site
lists abortion providers whom party members want to face
``Nuremberg Trials'' for performing abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of Slepian's murder, a slash appeared through his
name on the Web page, indicating he had become a ``fatality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be part of our investigation,'' said Bernard A.
Tolbert, special agent in charge of the FBI office in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   A law enforcement task force, which reported no significant
development in the investigation, held a news conference Monday to
offer a $100,000 reward for information leading to the killer's
arrest and appealed to the public for help.
</P>
<P>
   The plea was overshadowed, however, when Amherst Police Chief
John B. Askey, responding to a reporter's question, acknowledged
that Slepian's wife, Lynn, had faxed the police department a
warning of possible violence the doctor had received. She faxed the
information, from the National Abortion Federation, hours before
his murder.
</P>
<P>
   The fax did not cite a specific threat or request immediate
action.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he regretted taking no action on the fax, Askey
replied, ``I regret that the doctor is dead.'' He added, ``We have
done everything that has been requested of us.''
</P>
<P>
   But abortion-clinic security specialists said police in Amherst
and other communities have not heeded their urgent warnings about
the threat of increasing violence, particularly near Canada's
Remembrance Day on Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, 52, was the fifth abortion provider in the United
States and Canada since 1994 to be shot by a sniper with a
high-powered rifle near Remembrance Day, which some antiabortion
activists in Canada refer to as ``Remember the Unborn Child Day.''
The other doctors survived the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, who had just returned from a synagogue service to honor
his late father, was hit in the back by a bullet and died in front
of his wife and four sons, ages 7 to 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been banging on police station doors, saying, `Don't
forget this holiday,''' said Ann Glazier, director of clinic
defense and research for the Planned Parenthood Federation of
America. ``But all they are saying is, `Yeah, yeah, yeah.' It's
appalling.''
</P>
<P>
   Slepian had long been considered a prominent enemy of the
antiabortion movement because of his outspoken disdain for what he
described as the protesters' inflammatory tactics. His home was
often picketed, and his wife and sons were occasional targets of
verbal abuse.
</P>
<P>
   At his private funeral Monday, a letter was read from President
Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton. It said in part: ``Violence in
our society hurts all, but few have had to endure its effects so
personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights groups said demonstrations at clinics and the
homes of providers generally have decreased since the federal
Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act took effect in 1994,
expanding protections for clinics, patients, and doctors, and
increasing penalties for offenders.
</P>
<P>
   But abortion-rights advocates said acts of serious violence have
escalated. In recent months, two abortion clinics in North Carolina
were firebombed. Also, 22 clinics in Florida, Louisiana and Texas
were attacked with butyric acid, a non-lethal chemical that
nauseated many patients and workers and sent some to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, federal authorities have doubled to 200 the number
of officers searching in the mountains of western North Carolina
for Eric Rudolph, who is wanted for four bombings, including a
January attack on an abortion clinic in Birmingham, Ala., in which
an off-duty police officer was killed and a nurse critically
injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a tremendous jump in the violence,'' Glazier
said.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian lived in Amherst, an upscale Buffalo suburb, but he
performed most of his abortions in the city, which is heavily
Catholic and generally socially conservative. Buffalo has been a
magnet for antiabortion activists through the years, particulary in
1992 when a massive protest prompted Slepian to briefly close his
practice.
</P>
<P>
   After two receptionists were killed in 1996 in shootings at
Brookline abortion clinics, Slepian blamed some of the
rank-and-file Christian protesters in the antiabortion movement in
part for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These nonviolent people who are clasping their rosaries are
bearing witness or serving as supporters for the leaders who are
more vocal and scream at the patients,'' Slepian said in an
interview in the Buffalo News. ``By their numbers and their
support, they bear some responsibility for the violence.''
</P>
<P>
   But Roman Catholic leaders in Buffalo expressed outrage at
Slepian's murder. ``This is a cowardly, vicious, heinous act,''
said Bishop Henry J. Mansell of the Buffalo Diocese at a news
conference on Sunday. He also noted Slepian's death in his Sunday
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they have not yet completed ballistics tests on the
slug they retrieved from Slepian's home and the shell casing they
found on a rise in a wooded area behind a fence in his back yard.
They hope to determine, among other things, whether the same weapon
was used in the four previous sniper attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The task force also is pursuing tips that a white car, possibly
with Ontario license plates, was seen near Slepian's home around
the time of the murder. And though investigators said they have yet
to develop a psychological profile of the killer, Askey said they
knew what they were looking for: ``a psychopath.''

<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ At this point in her race for the House two
years ago, polls showed Anne Northup with the support of about 8
percent of her district's African-American vote. And though she
squeaked out a victory, Ms. Northup, a Republican, fared so poorly
in Louisville's black neighborhoods that in one precinct she
received only 5 out of 600 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cases like that you figure that five people must have voted
for me by mistake,'' she says now with a rueful laugh. ``It was
devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the poor showing among black voters, Ms. Northup, who is
white and has adopted two black children, worked to build bridges
to the city's black residents. She formed a close association with
two of the city's most powerful black ministers and directed nearly
$3 million in federal money to self-help projects they operated.
</P>
<P>
   Her work seemed to be paying off. Recent polls showed her
support among blacks who are considered likely to vote in this
year's election has grown to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But having voted with the rest of the House Republicans to
authorize an open-ended impeachment investigation of President
Clinton, Ms. Northup is one of several lawmakers identified as
targets of a new Democratic get-out-the-vote campaign in black
areas.
</P>
<P>
   She is facing the prospect that her efforts to woo black voters
may be short-circuited by the continuing Washington inquiry and
strong black support for the President.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard many people say that they like Anne Northup,'' said
the Rev. Kevin Cosby, pastor of St. Stephen Baptist Church, the
largest black church in the state and an unabashed fan of Ms.
Northup. ``They're only concerned about the president and how she
would vote with regards to the impeachment of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Northup's problem is but one example of what Democratic
strategists are hoping will be the pivotal role played by black
voters in this year's election. The Joint Center for Political and
Economic Studies, a nonpartisan research organization, has
identified nine Senate races _ in Arkansas, California, Georgia,
Illinois, Kentucky, New York, North Carolina, Ohio and South
Carolina _ and 19 House contests where the black vote could be
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists are hoping that the anger expressed by
blacks toward Republicans that has been showing up in sizable
numbers in public opinion surveys will translate itself into strong
turnout at the polls. The Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee has pinpointed at least 10 close House races with large
numbers of black voters for special get-out-the-vote efforts.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Congressional Black Caucus will begin a
five-city bus tour to encourage blacks to go to the polls on Nov.
3. The first stop will be in this city along the Ohio River to urge
blacks to come to vote for Chris Gorman, the former Kentucky
attorney general who is in a tight race with Ms. Northup.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., organized the bus tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to energize the black vote which generally is just
as low, if not lower, than others in an off-year election,'' Rangel
said ``There is no question that the African-American community
strongly supports the President and strongly opposes anything that
could be perceived as an effort to drive him out of office.''
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky's 3rd Congressional District, which encompasses
Louisville and parts of its suburbs, is a classic swing district.
It has shifted from Republican to Democrat to Republican in the
last three elections. In 1996, Ms. Northup won by 1,299 votes, less
than 1 percent of the nearly 251,000 cast, while Clinton carried
the district overwhelmingly.
</P>
<P>
   With blacks making up 16.3 percent of its population that has
reached voting age, strategists hope that a big turnout will lead
to an upset victory for Gorman.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other Democratic candidates in Kentucky, Gorman is not
shy about trumpeting his support for Clinton and castigating the
Republicans for the impeachment investigation. This week he will
start broadcasting a commercial on black radio stations in which
the Rev. Jesse Jackson criticizes Ms. Northup on a number of
issues, including her vote in favor of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They support President Clinton and they support candidates
like myself who have indicated that while what the president did
was wrong and he should be punished, he should not be impeached,''
Gorman said of black voters. ``I've read the Starr report and there
is nothing impeachable in there. So he needs to be punished very
quickly, and we need to move on with it and talk about other
issues. I can guarantee you that's the feeling of well over 95
percent of the black community in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Northup has tried to walk a fine line on the
impeachment matter. She voted with the Republican majority for an
open-ended inquiry, fearing that if an investigation was limited in
scope and time, Clinton would ``run out the clock.'' But she has
not, in her words, ``gotten out and railed against'' the president
on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, when it comes to the impeachment question,
that's one area where I feel a tremendous responsibility to at
least understand how they feel about it and be very sensitive to
it,'' Ms. Northup said of black voters in her district.
</P>
<P>
   The open question is how much her party's stand on impeachment
has undercut her efforts to forge relationships with blacks. Those
efforts began shortly after her election when she met first with
the Rev. Walter Malone, minister of New Canaan Baptist Church, and
with Cosby. Both ministers represent a new faction of black clergy
and black leadership. They emphasize a self-help philosophy and are
not shy to embrace Republican help.
</P>
<P>
   Cosby, whose church attracted 1,500 people to Bible study last
Wednesday evening, said, ``African Americans have a lot of local
concerns and Anne Northup has been very accessible to the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he declines to say that he endorses her re-election,
Cosby makes clear that he would not be dismayed if she is returned
to the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Jesse Jackson say something I agree with _ good
political works result in good political consequences,'' Cosby
said. ``In my opinion, Anne Northup has produced for our community
some good political works.''

(ATTN: S.C.)  
 REP. GRAHAM CAUTIONS CONGRESS AND GOP ON IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDERSON, S.C. _ ``Bill Clinton brings out passion in people and
that's what makes him a hard character to sit in judgment of,''
mused Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., driving across his sun-dappled
rural district far from Washington and pondering the impeachment
task that awaits him after the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``God knows, everybody is willing to forgive this guy,'' said
Graham, 43, one of the more contrarian Republicans on the Judiciary
Committee, one who did not hesitate, as a firebrand conservative,
to take part in the failed leadership coup against Speaker Newt
Gingrich last year. For this, he was tabbed by Congressional
Quarterly as one of the year's 12 outstanding House members _ an
outspoken ``kamikaze'' leader of the Contract With America class of
1994, unflinching in challenging the patriarch.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here was Graham, unopposed this election in a strongly
anti-Clinton district, speaking about the impeachment of the
president with gently measured words of caution to both the
Congress and his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're seen as people who just played politics with a very
bad event, that will hurt us for years to come; we'll be trapped in
it,'' he said, consumed by the subject as the soothing Carolina
countryside drifted by.
</P>
<P>
   As he drove and talked, Graham displayed his lawyer's
inclination to lay out the pros and cons of the political struggle
that looms between the Congress and the president.
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned Clinton against clinging to the strategy of
claiming to be ``legally correct'' under oath, while admitting he
otherwise misled the nation. Democratic defections on the
impeachment issue will quickly follow Election Day, he said, if
Republicans make substantial gains in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats will be on this guy like that,'' he said,
snapping his fingers at the blue sky beyond the windshield.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if this thing comes down to an inappropriate relationship
in the White House where an intern is approached, the president has
problems relating to women and has been less than a perfect
husband, well, everybody can put their label on it,'' he said with
an easy twang. ``But for the sake of politics and the future of
this country, that should not be grounds for impeachment, because
then you'll be giving open season for anybody in the political
system who wants to gain power by trashing out a political enemy
for having an affair.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles farther along the road, Graham conjured up a
different president, one he said was perhaps as ``dark'' in his
willful evasions of the truth as Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a dark side to Bill Clinton, potentially _ the
consuming personality who wants what he wants and don't get in the
way of it before or after,'' he postulated, estimating that if the
committee can show the nation a pattern of the president's
systematically foiling the justice system, he will be seen as being
every bit ``as dangerous to our legal system as Richard Nixon was
to our political system.''
</P>
<P>
   But that ``would be very hard to prove,'' Graham added
instantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to need a couple of John Deans,'' he said,
referring to the White House counsel who testified against Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour drive opened a window into the detailed thinking
of a candid Judiciary Committee member who openly wonders whether
the nation is delving into ``Watergate or Peyton Place.''
</P>
<P>
   With a small bipartisan group of committee colleagues, he has
been scouting the possibilities of a compromise settlement of the
impeachment issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution is a very flexible document,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   While Graham clearly relishes delivering political stings as a
conservative infighter, he said he learned to love the law above
all else, as the first member of his family to go to college. He
also served overseas as a lawyer in the military.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that the committee seemed likely to produce an
impeachment charge of perjury against the president, for his
testimony before the grand jury. But ``if the votes aren't there in
the Senate'' for conviction, Graham said, the matter might be
better resolved by a compromise among congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If President Clinton lied to a grand jury, we can't ignore
that, but if he would just absolutely come clean about it, then you
would have a sense of proportionality about the punishment,''
Graham said. Once more, he seemed to be confronting the president
as much as the country road ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quit dancing on the head of a pin,'' he advised Clinton.
``Quit insulting my intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressman added that the president should abandon further
legalisms and plainly tell the nation about the Monica Lewinsky
matter: ``Our relationship as described by Ms. Lewinsky is true. If
that makes me a perjurer, then prosecute me. But I feel I'm a good
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham finally had to smile because he was preoccupied with the
very Washington topic he thought he might escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I came home,'' he said.

 &HT;    Motorola cuts 190 jobs in Austin, Texas
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Motorola Inc. on Monday said it would cut 190
jobs in Austin in the face of a prolonged downturn in the computer
chip industry.
</P>
<P>
   The number surprised some observers, who expected more jobs
would be eliminated in the company's effort to slash expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Another 400 Austin workers took incentive packages to leave the
company voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts apparently end for now questions about how hard
Motorola's Austin operations would be hit. In a message to
employees, Hector Ruiz, president of Motorola's Semiconductor
Products Sector, said it doesn't plan more cuts this year.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's job cuts were spread out through manufacturing,
administration and support staff.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., has been dealing with
several problems: Lower prices for semiconductor sales, weak
economies in Asia and its own slow development of products for
digital telecommunications products. Overall, the semiconductor
sector, which is based in Austin, has cut 6,000 jobs this year
through severance plans, layoffs and attrition, spokesman Scott
Stevens said. Also on Monday, the company cut 225 jobs in its
Phoenix semiconductor operations, where 1,200 took severance
packages.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola said it intends to cut 15,000 jobs in its global
operations in order to reduce expenses. The company has said that
through the third quarter it saved $140 million through job cuts
and consolidation toward its goal of $750 million.
</P>
<P>
   Other cost-cutting measures include halting construction of a
chip plant in Virginia and folding the operations of one division
into others.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's stock rose $1.75 to $49 a share in New York Stock
Exchange trading Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss of nearly 600 jobs, Motorola said its Austin
employment remains at about 10,000 _ the same number it reported at
the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman explained that by saying the company continues to
hire engineers who are working to develop new products and some
employees have transferred to Austin from other Motorola locations.
The number of job cuts in Austin surprised some analysts, who said
they expected more.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people who took the voluntary packages may have
helped reduce the number of cuts made Monday. Severance pay was
based on the number of years employees had been with Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola offered the voluntary packages three times this year.
There were reports that managers encouraged some workers to take
the packages or risk being fired.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Starnes, a principal analyst for Dataquest, the market
research company, attributed the lower-than-expected number to
development of products the company makes in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin has and will continue to fare better than other
locations for Motorola,'' said Starnes, an Austin resident. ``In
semiconductors, most of the really sexy, cool sophisticated
products in Motorola are designed, developed and in many cases
manufactured right here in Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   The company manufactures semiconductors used in computers,
cellular phones and automobiles in its Austin operations.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola says it wants to keep as many workers as it can for a
rebound in the semiconductor industry it expects will begin next
year. It predicts chip sales will rise 9 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A supplier of equipment to Motorola said he believes that the
company's Texas operations have become a priority for Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Cunningham, an account manager for Electro-Graph Inc. in
Carlsbad, Calif., said orders from Motorola's Arizona operations
have dropped while Motorola in Texas has expressed interest in
using his company as a second source for parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Previously, we hadn't done business with them (in Texas),''
Cunningham said. ``It's really an opportunity for us to increase
our business with companies that are hurting. They need to save
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Motorola's actions will help is still to be determined,
analysts said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Eisenbarth, an analyst at Collins and Co., said the
company has made some good moves in cuts, but it's too early to see
if Motorola can change its fortunes. ``I think they've passed the
midpoint, but we haven't really seen the long-term effects yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Starnes agreed. ``We're still looking for something that
indicates Motorola is working better doing things this way than
before the reorganization,'' he said. ``Their performance has been
no better than other vendors during this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately on Monday, Alcatel Corp. said that it will eliminate
100 jobs and its development center in Austin as part of cutbacks
in its Texas operations. The company is cutting another 300 jobs in
its Plano and Richardson operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin workers are software and hardware engineers and
developers, said Mark Burnworth, Alcatel's director of corporate
communications. The cuts come in the aftermath of the French
company's $4 billion acquisition of DSC Communications Corp. of
Plano, which became final Sept. 4. The Austin operation had been
part of DSC.
</P>
<P>
   Alcatel is the world's fourth biggest telecommunications
equipment maker. DSC made access and switching equipment.

 &HT;    Motorola not only company feeling sting of semiconductor slump
By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The business of making computer chips may never
again be the driving force in the high-tech economy that it was in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Motorola Inc. was adding 1,000 jobs a year and
building a billion-dollar chip plant here and Applied Materials was
building its manufacturing center.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, the chip industry has slammed into a brick
wall. Around the world, chip companies are cutting jobs, postponing
or canceling projects and cutting costs wherever they can to cope
with lower revenue.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Motorola said it cut 190 jobs and that another 400
workers had taken an incentive package to leave the company.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill., had for several
years been Austin's biggest private sector employer. It has been
surpassed by Dell Computer Corp., which has been adding thousands
of workers per quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Motorola cuts follow those made at Applied Materials, DuPont
Photomasks, Cirrus Logic Inc. and others in the past few months.
Small companies that supply the big manufacturers also have made
reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, chip-related companies have lost a combined 4,500
Austin jobs this year, according to Angelou Economic Advisors. A
drop of more than 20 percent, the number includes people who have
left for other industries, taken incentive packages and been fired.
</P>
<P>
   That may signal a bigger change within Austin high-tech economy,
which accounts for about one-fifth of the area's work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a shift to an economy more focused on knowledge
jobs rather than manufacturing jobs,'' said Chris Engle, the
consulting firm's director of research.
</P>
<P>
   That's different from companies who are weighed down by large,
expensive manufacturing plants with lots of overhead. Those will
still be major players, but their growth curve is flattening.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, the Angelou firm expects the burgeoning
software sector will have passed the local chip industry in the
number of jobs supplied, probably for good.
</P>
<P>
   Shrinking employment at Motorola, Applied Materials and dozens
of other chip-related companies will put the chip industry in third
place among Austin high-tech segments, behind computer hardware,
led by Dell Computer Corp., and software.
</P>
<P>
   The growing number of companies that design chips, but have them
made by someone else is indicative of the trend.
</P>
<P>
   These companies design chips, market and sell them. But they
farm the manufacturing out to other companies, called foundries.
Even Motorola has indicated it will shift more of its manufacturing
outside the company.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those new companies are doing well. Silicon
Laboratories, a two-year-old startup with 39 employees, wants to
fill several job openings following the successful release of three
new chips designed to be used in computer modems, cellular phones
and other products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice time to be a young company growing with hot, new
products,'' said Brad Fluke, Silicon Labs' vice president of
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of design talent available in Austin has even
attracted Intel Corp. The biggest and most profitable of chip
companies, it is opening a chip design center in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Cadence Design Systems, a San Jose, Calif.-based maker of
software tools for semiconductor design, expects to employ 75
people in its Austin customer support center by the end of the
year. Cadence will do chip designs for a variety of semiconductor
firms.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech recruiter Kim Butler of Greywolf Consulting said he
expects to see more chip design businesses grow up in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller companies with a high focus can move faster and get
products to market more quickly than some of their larger rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emerging companies are going to be the small, fabless
design houses,'' Butler said. ``They can be turn on a dime if they
see a new product opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   While design activity increases in Austin, Butler believes that
a tight labor market, among other factors, will force chip
manufacturing to shrink here over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin is now seen as a great design and development center,''
he said. ``Companies are moving here to build design centers. They
are not building a lot of factories here.''

 &HT;    Even in downturn, some companies expand
 &HT;    By Lori Hawkins

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ As companies in the semiconductor industry slash jobs,
others are hiring at a record pace.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp., based in Round Rock, added 2,000 Central
Texas jobs in the past quarter alone.
</P>
<P>
   Others include Cisco Systems (formerly NetSpeed), Computer
Sciences Corp., and Tivoli Systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate to have a fairly diversified technology
sector,'' said Angelos Angelou, an Austin economist. ``We're
fortunate that none of the other tech sectors are in the same
business cycle as semiconductors.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the chip slump, Angelou still predicts Austin will add
20,000 jobs this year, primarily in the technology sector. That
compares with 24,600 jobs created in 1997. Austin's entrepreneurial
tech companies account for some of the growth. Many of them
continue to hustle for workers. To reach job candidates, they are
running radio ads, paying referral bonuses and collecting resumes
at job fairs.
</P>
<P>
   Acuity Corp., an Austin company developing software for the
Internet, is among those in the expansion mode.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has 100 employees, plans to add 100 over the
next year. To attract workers _ including software developers,
customer integration engineers and technical sales people _ it has
run radio ads, expanded its Internet advertising and widened its
college recruiting program. Employees who make a successful
referral get a $2,500 bonus.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 high-tech companies from around the country will be
in Austin this week looking for talent.
</P>
<P>
   The Westech Career Expo at Palmer Auditorium will target
engineers in industries including software, telecommunications and
semiconductors.

D'AMATO AND SCHUMER ARE TIED IN LATEST N.Y. TIMES/CBS POLL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY with MARJORIE CONNELLY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York voters are growing increasingly critical of
the caustic tone of the campaign for Senate, but the daily rounds
of attacks between Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Rep. Charles Schumer
have yet to sway significant numbers of them, according to the
latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican senator and his Democratic challenger are each
favored by 44 percent of likely voters, according to the poll,
which was taken from Oct. 21 through Oct. 25. That is essentially
the same finding as in the last Times/CBS News poll of three weeks
ago. Ten percent of voters remain undecided.
</P>
<P>
   If there is consensus on anything, it is that the race between a
nationallyknown three-term senator and a congressman from Brooklyn
_ which has been dominated by D'Amato's criticism of Schumer's
congressional attendance rating and Schumer's daily attacks on his
rival's credibility _ has been extraordinarily negative. Voters
said the candidates were spending far more time attacking each
other than explaining what they would do in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of voters believe that the race is harsher than
the one in 1992, when D'Amato defeated Robert Abrams in a race that
many New York politicians still consider the benchmark for negative
campaigns in the state over the last decade. And voters are more
likely to blame D'Amato for the harsh tenor of this year's race,
saying that D'Amato was spending more time attacking than
explaining what he was going to do, and that he was more likely
than Schumer to be unfair in his attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, given that this and almost every other public
opinion poll since the Sept. 15 primary have found the race to be a
statistical tie, the attacks are almost certain to continue in the
final week, and could intensify. Victory for either Schumer or
D'Amato now turns largely on the decision of the 10 percent of
undecided voters who, the poll suggests, have not paid much
attention to the contests until now and do not have particularly
firm opinions of either Schumer or D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule of thumb, undecided voters make up their minds in the
final week of the campaign, when they first begin paying attention
to the advertisements and newspaper coverage of the contest.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also suggests how important turnout will be in
determining the outcome. That calculation is clearly influencing
all the plans being laid by D'Amato and Schumer this week, from
Schumer's decision to campaign with Hillary Rodham Clinton on
Tuesday and President Clinton on Friday, to D'Amato's energetic
schedule which will take him into a region where his support is
strong: upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   The poll suggests one possible opening for Schumer in the days
ahead. By 46 percent to 36 percent, voters said they would prefer
having Schumer rather than D'Amato sitting in judgment on Clinton
should there be a Senate trial on the charges that grew out of
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of all New Yorkers think the congressional inquiry
into Clinton should be dropped. Schumer has said he would oppose
removing Clinton from office, while D'Amato has declined to offer
an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found Schumer doing significantly better among one
segment of the electorate that has drawn attention from both
candidates in recent weeks _ 58 percent of Jewish voters said they
favored him. Nonetheless, D'Amato, who has made a strong effort to
align himself with issues of concern to Jewish voters, drew 38
percent in this poll. In the last two elections, D'Amato received
about 40 percent of the Jewish vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS News poll was based on telephone interviews with
1,235 registered voters across New York state, conducted from Oct.
21 through Oct. 25. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   For all the noise of the last six weeks, the unceasing attacks
have not produced clear dividends for either D'Amato or Schumer,
though that will probably change in the final days, as undecided
voters start making their decisions. In terms of their standing in
the polls, Schumer and D'Amato remain where they were three weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of them has seen the kind of sharp increases in
unfavorable rating that normally accompany these kinds of negative
campaigns. D'Amato's remained unchanged from three weeks ago, at 37
percent, evidence that most New Yorkers' views of the 18-year
incumbent are fairly well set.
</P>
<P>
   The number of voters who view Schumer unfavorably has edged up
slightly over the past three weeks, from 18 percent to 23 percent.
But that is a relatively small increase considering the intensity
with which D'Amato has been attacking Schumer literally from the
night the Brooklyn Democrat won the nomination.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   D'Amato has certainly managed to capture the public's attention
with his single line of attack on Schumer this month: that Schumer
repeatedly skipped votes in Washington. Eighty-four percent of
those polled had heard of the attack; 27 percent said they were
bothered ``a lot'' by Schumer's absences, and 34 percent said they
were bothered ``some.''
</P>
<P>
   But again, it is unclear if, or how much, this line of attack is
hurting Schumer: 59 percent of respondents called the charge
``politics as usual,'' compared to 21 percent who viewed it as a
serious issue. And half of those polled said Schumer worked hard in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts from both parties said D'Amato and Schumer
were equally responsible for the harsh tone of this race. Schumer,
for example, ends his television advertisements with the tag line,
``Too many lies for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   But voters clearly see D`Amato as running the more negative
campaign: 73 percent of those polled said he was spending more time
attacking his opponent than explaining what he would do in
Congress, an extraordinarily high figure. Only 12 percent said he
was spending more time explaining. By contrast, 54 percent said
Schumer was spending more time attacking, compared with 21 percent
explaining.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign that D'Amato was suffering politically because
of that. Indeed, D'Amato's advisers have long argued that there is
no political price to pay for running hard-edged campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   By a slight margin, 49 percent to 43 percent, voters agreed with
another central contention of Schumer, that D'Amato has been in
office too long. That is theme that frequently works against
incumbents who have been in office for a long time _ D'Amato was
elected in 1980 _ and it is a point that Schumer is expected to hit
with increased intensity in the week ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed continued geographical differences in how the
candidates were doing. D'Amato was running more strongly in the
suburbs than he was three weeks ago: he now leads Schumer by 51
percent to 39 percent, compared with 46 percent to 41 percent three
weeks. Schumer continued to dominate in New York City, by a margin
of 66 percent to 23 percent, while D'Amato led upstate, 48 percent
to 34 percent.

SPORTS COLUMN: BIG SPENDING CAN MAKE FISCAL SENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The headline writer's job is to capture the essence of the
story, and such was the case for the author of Monday's Mets press
release. ``Mets sign Mike Piazza to a record seven-year $91 million
contract,'' the enlarged, bold print announced, with organizational
pride and unrestrained glee.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, in fact, broke from team policy to shout, look at us,
we're big spenders. ``We've never done that,'' admitted Steve
Phillips, the general manager. ``But everyone seemed to know the
figure already, and it also showed a commitment to winning and a
willingness to invest. That image hasn't been there in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   When you add negotiated amenities such as the mandatory hotel
suite and use of a Shea Stadium luxury box to the $91 million in
bonuses and salary, what Piazza is getting, roughly, is a $100
million value pack. And, as the Mets chirped in the first paragraph
of their press release, ``the most lucrative player-contract in the
history of major-league baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what happens when the system works in a way that is more
prudent than panicked _ sports economics as it oughta be _ and a
30-year-old future Hall of Famer cashes in on production, not
potential. Are you locked-out pro basketball rank-and-filers paying
attention? The Mets drew up the paperwork, didn't blink, and no one
booed. No one responded to the magnitude of the deal by questioning
Piazza's worth or by forecasting financial Armageddon. Able to
quantify what Piazza meant to them at the gate and in the standing,
the Mets locked up their franchise-defining player for the coming
years when they will be competing with Mayor Steinbrenner's team
for civic bragging rights and taxpayer dollars to build new ball
parks.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Phillips indicated, those ticket price increases are
undoubtedly coming but the telephones in the office, he said, were
``ringing off the hook.'' In other words, the overnight consensus
is that Piazza is worth every penny the Mets and their fans will
have to pay.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago at this time, the radio talk lines were filled with
demands for the Mets to produce someone, anyone, to improve the
profile of what Phillips called ``good little players on a good
little team.'' Phillips would never admit to this but he probably
had one good at-bat to win himself an extended term running the
Mets. Fair or not, mistakes in excess of $10 million a year are not
easily explained to one's boss. Had Phillips succumbed to last
year's public pressure and sold Nelson Doubleday and Fred Wilpon on
say, Gary Sheffield, the Mets would be spent as playoff contenders,
stumbling on in the forgettable tradition of George Foster and
Bobby Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say the toughest thing to do is pull the trigger,''
Phillips said. ``But the toughest thing is to walk away when people
are clamoring for you to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Piazza deal last summer, the Mets surrendered prospects,
no phenoms, but ran the risk of a public relations fiasco. When
Piazza was greeted by the fans like the unproductive stranger he
was, there was too much concern of how the rude reception would
play on his long-term decision, not enough attention given to
Piazza having to prove he could thrive in a city where some very
talented players have not dealt with the money and the accompanying
pressure to perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the growing pains,'' Phillips said. By the end of the
season, Piazza was the hottest hitter in baseball, Howard Stern
knew his phone number and Piazza went home to California to realize
he missed the tumult and the tabloids. ``I knew,'' he said, ``the
page had turned.''
</P>
<P>
   It was apparent Monday that neither party had jumped into this
seven-year marriage. The Mets' long-awaited splash was not into an
ocean with scary undertow. Instead of water wings, they are wearing
Piazza's record and, Phillips said, Piazza has even ``guaranteed
that he wouldn't get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone laughed, including Doubleday and Wilpon. If only sports
owners could take out performance insurance. David Stern says this
dirty little basketball war is over ``cost certainty'' for owners.
What he really needs _ and what I suspect he will end up with _ is
some system that prevents inflationary contracts for players who
have done little, or nothing. When the veteran star and a proven
commodity makes out, critics and fans do not start pondering his
relative contribution to the betterment of mankind. Owners do not
feel as if they have held up at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   They happily consider it what Phillips called this Piazza deal,
``a smart investment.'' A $91 million-plus badge of honor.

CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS ACCUSE PARTY OFFICIALS OF WITHHOLDING
CAMPAIGN FUNDS
</HEADLINE>

(Also moving in ``a'' news file) 
(sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leading Democrats in Congress have angrily accused
officials at the White House and the Democratic National Committee
of hurting House and Senate campaigns by husbanding resources to
erase the party's debt and help Vice President Al Gore kick off his
own campaign in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional Democrats also assert that top party officials
are inadvertently discouraging party loyalists from voting, and are
dampening fund-raising efforts, by making dire predictions that the
party could lose as many as 25 House seats.
</P>
<P>
   The finance chairman of the party's Congressional Campaign
Committee, Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, was so incensed about
the party's modest stated goals that he had this advice for the
party chairman: ``Keep your money and shut up your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials on both sides of the argument say the feuding, only
one week before Election Day, is a giant distraction at a time the
party needs to stay focused on a common enemy, the Republicans, who
are in the final days of the most ambitious party-paid advertising
campaign in any non-presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   While rifts are common within both parties, the current schism
among Democrats is unusually bitter. And it comes at a time when
the usual stakes of an off-year election are even higher with the
impeachment inquiry pending before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lawmakers say they are particularly furious at the
national committee, saying it has fallen woefully short of past
elections in financing efforts to help House and Senate candidates.
In fact, the Democratic Party has struggled to raise $11 million in
a highly publicized ``Unity'' program to help candidates this year
despite an original goal of $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   And although the two organizations that help finance the party's
candidates, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, wanted to divide the $11
million raised, the party took a third for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials said they did not have a precise figure of how
much less the party committees were taking in from the national
party this year. But, as an example, in the last midterm election,
in 1994, the party made a direct transfer of $2 million to the
Congressional Campaign Committee. So far this year, the party had
transferred only $715,000 to the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in Congress are also angry that officials in the party
and at the White House have argued publicly that, given historical
trends, anything less than a 25-seat loss for House Democrats would
be a victory. Party officials said such remarks were intended to
lower expectations so even large losses will not be interpreted as
a referendum on whether President Clinton should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the senatorial and congressional committees
complain that such talk is at odds with their own public
predictions that the Democrats could pick up seats.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Monday, Rangel said he was outraged at recent
public comments by Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, the general chairman
of the Democratic National Committee, that the party could lose
many House seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I don't know what the hell the DNC does _ let him do
what he has to do for the president,'' Rangel said of Romer. ``He's
not elected to a damn thing. And nobody should give a damn about
his opinion. He's not entitled to an opinion of congressional
races. He's an appointee. It happens to all of us. You get on
television and you become an expert.''
</P>
<P>
   Accusing the Democratic National Committee of being stingy, he
said: ``Keep your money and shut up your mouth. What damn
credibility has he got as governor of Colorado? He just should shut
up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it like the whole world is waiting to see what's going to
happen in November based on the governor's evaluation of
congressional seats?'' Rangel continued. ``Give me a break!'' Party
officials, he said, ``suck up the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel was so infuriated that he upbraided Romer in a telephone
conversation on Thursday. ``Rangel was exactly correct to call
Romer on that,'' said Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, chairman of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ``Romer is simply
wrong. We're going to pick up seats.'' The party, he said, has been
so starved for money that ``we told our candidates they couldn't
rely on the national party coming in and helping them _ they had to
put it together themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee has been so unhelpful, Frost
added, that his own committee ``has taken the role that
historically the DNC would have filled in some areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer responded by accusing the party's Democratic leaders of
``misplaced grousing.'' He said, ``We were $15 million in debt. We
borrowed as much as our banks would loan us, to be honest about
it.'' He also said the party had to spend more than $12 million in
legal bills related to campaign finance investigations of the 1996
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Rangel's comments, he said, ``Charlie is concerned
that when he is out motivating his troops he wants to say, `We're
going to win the majority back.' That's what you say when you're
out there on stump. But if I'm going to keep my credibility, I
can't give you campaign rhetoric and say, `that's my expectation.'
I want them to win a majority. That's just a hard reach.''
</P>
<P>
   In all but one midterm election since the Civil War, the party
of the president has lost ground in the House of Representative,
from two to 96 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Several House Democratic officials _ including backers of Rep.
Dick Gephardt, the minority leader, who is considering running for
president _ suggested that the White House was sitting on money so
the party would be well-positioned to help Gore run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Sosnik, a senior White House adviser, disputed that
Clinton has been inattentive to the financial needs of candidates.
``The president has spent a tremendous amount of time fund raising
on behalf of House and Senate candidates for the past two years,''
he said. ``If you have any doubts, look up how many articles have
been written about how much time he has spent going to fund
raisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another top White House official said the congressional
Democrats were too demanding _ and unrealistic. ``They're
whining,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``Everybody wants more money, and they're just looking
for someone to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the clashes are competing interests at the
highest levels of the Democratic Party. They are in some ways an
escalation of strains from 1994 when congressional Democrats
accused Clinton of costing them control of the House, and 1996,
when they said he did not do enough to help the party try to regain
the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that the leaders of the party can't get
together and agree on a single approach to these last weeks,'' said
Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster whose clients include Gephardt
and Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate Democratic leader.
``All these committees are united in wanting to help Democrats. But
the political imperatives work in different directions for
different elements of the Democratic Party, whether you're talking
about how money should be spent or how expectations should be
set.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several state Democratic leaders have also complained that they
need more money, particularly since the Republican Party has
outraised the Democrats by tens of millions of dollars in this
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never enough and we need more,'' said Art Torres,
chairman of the California Democratic Party. ``My only frame of
reference is '96. It was much more generous last time, but that was
a presidential year.'' Torres added that he understands ``it's
really tough when you're in the middle of a campaign to make sure
you take care of your party as well as the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   To compensate for the shortfall in fund raising for the Unity
program, the party took out a $3 million loan last month that was
divided between the campaign committees. But on a conference call
with Clinton last month, party officials said, Congressional
Democrats had asked for $8 million. Participating in the call, the
officials said, were Gephardt, Daschle and Frost.
</P>
<P>
   Romer said he has no apologies for not raising more money.
``We've put the well dry,'' he said, adding that banks refused to
loan the cash-strapped party any more money.
</P>
<P>
   But Rangel was not impressed. ``He's a nice person,'' he said of
the governor. ``When he's quiet.''

MAINE: DEMOCRATS ARE STARING INTO THE ABYSS 
WASHINGTON: AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND THE USE OF KING'S WORDS 
NORTH CAROLINA: SENATOR'S LEAD FOOT IS GETTING LIGHTER, SORT OF
</HEADLINE>
   (ll) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``As Maine goes, so goes the nation,'' or so went an old
political saw. But that was before Maine became one of the nation's
most politically quirky states.
</P>
<P>
   Now Maine voters are so unpredictably independent-minded that
four years ago they elected the nation's only independent Governor,
Angus King. And if the latest poll has it right, they will re-elect
him next week, in a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   In what is basically a two-party nation, that is impressive. But
there is no evidence that any other state is moving in that
ideological direction. Certainly Democrats better hope that is the
case, given the grief King is causing their party in Maine. Nor,
for that matter, should Republicans smirk.
</P>
<P>
   The poll that has King winning re-election also has his
Democratic and Republican challengers running so far behind that
they are almost off the radar. The Republican, James Longley, a
former Congressman, has just 13 percent of the vote and the
Democrat, Tom Connolly, a lawyer, has only 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials and political analysts say that if Maine voters
follow their usual pattern, Longley and Connolly will improve their
numbers on Election Day, though not sufficiently to give King
pause. Still, Democrats, in particular, are worried.
</P>
<P>
   If Connolly does not pull at least 5 percent of the vote on Nov.
3, under Maine law the party will lose its official recognition.
That would mean that come 2000, the party would not be able to hold
a primary and officially nominate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   To head off such a disaster, state party officials are trying to
organize a drive to increase Democratic turnout. They have also
asked the national party for $50,000 to to help Connolly, who has
been outspent at least 7 to 1 by Governor King.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more than just a wake-up call,'' Craig Schuler, the
executive director of the party, said the other day. ``This is a
shot across the bow.''
</P>
<P>
   AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND THE USE OF KING'S WORDS
</P>
<P>
   California voted it down. Houston voted it up. And next week
Washington State votes on affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   As in other states, opponents of such programs have repeatedly
invoked the words of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., recalling
his dream that one day his children would ``live in a nation where
they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the
content of their character.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, affirmative action defenders in Washington, as
elsewhere, have repeatedly called such use of King's words cynical
and dishonest.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the proponents went a step further. They called in
King's widow, Coretta Scott King.
</P>
<P>
   In an ``open letter to the citizens of Washington State,'' she
accused the opposition of using deception to destroy all her
husband had dreamt and died for. Then she added, ``Unfortunately,
we do not live in a society that is truly color-blind, and until
that day comes, affirmative action remains a necessary and vital
tool towards equality.''
</P>
<P>
   Polltakers say next week's vote could go either way.
</P>
<P>
   SENATOR'S LEAD FOOT GETTING LIGHTER, SORT OF
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, when he ran for governor of North Carolina and again in
1992, when he ran for the United States Senate, Lauch Faircloth's
driving record became something of an issue after newspapers
reported that he had been pulled over more than 30 times for
speeding. Faircloth, a hard-right Republican, conceded that he had
a `lead foot' and, expressing regret, promised to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get him elected to get him off the road,'' one of
his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   He lost the Governor's bid, won the Senate race and now is up
for re-election, facing a touch challenge from a well-known lawyer,
John Edwards, a moderate Democrat. Most polls show a dead heat. So
Faircloth is running hard.
</P>
<P>
   Well, truth to tell, he's speeding.
</P>
<P>
   He had been doing a pretty good job behind the wheel, for him _
only five tickets in 10 years, or half his usual number. But the
other night, hurrying along Interstate 40 near Durham toward a
speaking engagement, he raced past an unmarked patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   As Trooper C. J. Slemenda tells it, Faircloth was doing better
than 80 in a 65 m.p.h. zone. The senator does not dispute it. In
fact, he thought he saw a bit of political advantage in being
pulled, declaring later that he was ``no Bill Clinton'' and could
forthrightly admit wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Did he get a ticket?
</P>
<P>
   ``He was apologetic,'' Slemenda told the Charlotte Observer. ``I
used my discretion not to ticket him.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record: Edwards has been convicted of speeding once in
the past 10 years.

 ADVERTISING: MOVADO GROUP HIRES AGENCY TO RESET CONCORD WATCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A leading maker, distributor and retailer of watches is naming
an outside agency to handle one of its top brands.
</P>
<P>
   Movado Group Inc., which sells watches under such names as
Movado, ESQ, Corum, Piaget and Coach, has selected Arnell Group
Brand Consulting in New York as the agency for its Concord line of
luxury watches. Since 1972, that brand had been handled primarily
by an in-house creative team.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss-made Concord watches, priced at $2,000 to $15,000
each, compete against the likes of Baume &AMP; Mercier, Cartier and
Rolex. Arnell Group will advise Movado Group on tasks that include
establishing a position for the Concord brand in the luxury watch
market; developing advertising, with billings estimated at $8
million; creating a logo and devising packaging.
</P>
<P>
   Arnell Group is known for campaigns for such fashion brands as
Tommy Hilfiger and Donna Karan as well as imparting more stylish
images to such products as Casio G-Shock watches, Hanes hosiery,
Ray-Ban sunglasses and Samsung appliances. The choice of Arnell
Group as the Concord agency, to be formally announced Tuesday, is
an example of how marketers of premium-priced products are stepping
up efforts to peddle their wares to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an opportunity in the luxury segment and the watch
category in general, a huge opportunity to expand what we were
doing with Concord,'' said Scott Woodward, senior vice president
for global marketing and chief marketing officer at Movado Group in
Lyndhurst, N.J. Woodward, who also has an office in New York,
joined the company in early September after working for a year at
Calvin Klein Inc. as vice president for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the recent gyrations of the global equity
markets would adversely affect the demand for higher-priced
watches, Woodward replied: ``In the luxury category, you do have to
look at what's going on externally, such as the shift from the
flashy '80s to the conservative '90s. We want to explore what a
timepiece means to, and does for, an individual both rationally and
emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch advertising is pretty much standard across the board,
very product focused and very rational,'' Woodward said. ``We're
looking at something above and beyond traditional advertising, an
integrated marketing program that is more emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Arnell, chairman at Arnell Group, said he thought that
concerns about the direction of the economy might even stimulate
demand for jewelry and other luxury products that many consumers
consider long-term investments. His agency has gained experience in
the luxury market by working on such pricey brands as Bergdorf
Goodman, Chanel, Christian Dior, Christian Lacroix and Loewe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real opportunity is to bring a new cachet, a new emotion
to a category where there hasn't been very much,'' said Arnell, who
described himself as ``an avid watch collector for the last 10
years.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most watch pitches, he added, take predictable approaches like
``up-close still life, sports and dancers flying in the air to
symbolize performance and movement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a chance to get people to look at watches
differently,'' Arnell said, ``as I've done with Samsung, the boy
with the chest.'' His reference was to Arnell Group's print and
outdoor campaign for Samsung appliances, which features the
striking image of a fit, bare-chested young man toting a microwave
oven under his muscular arm.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward said: ``For Samsung, Peter took what was traditionally
a very dry category and did something interesting. And he knows how
to integrate a message across every level in a creative way. You
walk into Kmart to buy a Samsung microwave and the ad is on the
box.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnell Group was chosen for Concord after a review conducted by
AAR North America in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``AAR identified a host of agencies, large and small,'' Woodward
said. ``We looked closely at 10 of them and came to the conclusion
that Arnell Group was the appropriate selection.'' He declined to
identify the contenders, saying Movado had met only with Arnell,
not with any of the other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward and Arnell have worked together before, when Woodward
was a top advertising executive at Ray-Ban, a unit of Bausch &AMP;
Lomb. Did that preordain the selection of Arnell Group?
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't exclusively his decision by any means,'' said Dana
Glazer Gers, vice president at Movado Group, referring to Woodward.
``It was a senior management decision.'' The first Concord campaign
from Arnell Group is due next spring.

   Movado Group reported net sales for the fiscal year that ended
last Jan. 31 at a record $237 million, up 10.2 percent from $215.1
million in the previous fiscal year. The company's annual report
described the Concord brand, along with Movado, as ``standout
performers'' that ``generated strong sales growth in both our North
American and international markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Concord will be one of only two Movado Group watch brands
handled by an outside agency. The other is Coach, which was
introduced in April under an agreement with the Coach leather-goods
company owned by Sara Lee Corp. Those ads are created by Toth Brand
Imaging in New York and Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, the Coach agency is in Concord but not vice versa.

CRONKITE IN ORBIT OVER GLENN LAUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You might wonder who's being relaunched this week, John Glenn or
Walter Cronkite.
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite, 81, seems every bit as ubiquitous as his friend Glenn,
77, the Mercury astronaut who's due to be sent back into orbit on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When ``60 Minutes'' ran a Glenn segment eight days ago, there
was Cronkite, sharing space program memories with the Ohio senator.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn adorns the cover of TV Guide magazine this week, his face
over the stripes of a U.S. flag. A smiling Cronkite is right next
to him, planted over the field of stars.
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday morning, CNN will begin its extensive live
coverage of Glenn's scheduled space shuttle launch. The co-anchors
of CNN's mission coverage are Miles O'Brien and Walter Cronkite.
</P>
<P>
   So all in all, the next two weeks should be a stunning
demonstration of geriatric durability and power.
</P>
<P>
   Should be an unusual few weeks for Glenn, too.
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite, who admits to getting excited as a puppy by the manned
space program, wouldn't mind occupying Glenn's spacesuit this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted that my friend John Glenn is getting his flight,
and clearly he's the qualified one in every sense of the word,''
Cronkite said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as I told him in a phone call ... I told him that I
thought this was most unfair. I'm older than he is, and if they
want to test old age in space, I'm the guy to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Cronkite's fame derives from his space coverage as a CBS
correspondent and as anchor of ``The CBS Evening News'' from 1962
to 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Before the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
Cronkite said, the Air Force conducted rocket tests in semisecrecy.
He and other reporters ventured out on a jetty to observe unmanned
rocket launches at Cape Canaveral in Florida. Many ended in
spectacular explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Access improved with the formation of NASA and the advent of
manned space flight, Cronkite said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even the earliest (manned) flights were very primitive,''
he said of the coverage conditions. ``I covered (Alan) Shepard's
little pop downrange from the back of a station wagon, being chewed
up by mosquitoes on top and watching out for rattlesnakes below.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shepard suborbital flight was in 1961, three weeks after
Russia's Yuri Gagarin had become the first man in space. Glenn's
orbital ride, atop a type of rocket that was apt to explode, was in
February 1962.
</P>
<P>
   That first Glenn flight lasted less than five hours. Cronkite
was at the launch site, reporting from another makeshift vantage
point.
</P>
<P>
   More than two decades later, Cronkite had surrendered the CBS
anchor desk to Dan Rather, but he still had a chance at space
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to launch a civilian into space, NASA concocted a
``journalist in space'' program as a start. Cronkite was a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elimination process went quite a long way,'' he said. ``I
think we got down to 20 of us who were still in line for further
weeding out ... I felt I had a pretty good shot at that at the
time, and I was very excited and hopeful that the flight would take
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the meantime, President Reagan, making a campaign speech
before a teachers' union meeting in Chicago, got carried away and
promised that a teacher would be the first civilian in space. The
priority was changed by the president's ad-libbed comments, and
Christa McAuliffe was selected for the first civilian-in-space
flight.''
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe and six others died in the Challenger shuttle tragedy
in 1986. With a little jiggling of human destiny, it could have
been Cronkite.
</P>
<P>
   But now Cronkite will observe his 82nd birthday on November 2,
during his CNN stint with O'Brien. Though Cronkite is still under
contract at CBS, the network has no plans for extensive live
coverage of the Glenn flight and granted Cronkite permission to
appear on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   He knows that publicity is a valuable byproduct of the Glenn
mission, but Cronkite bristles, ever so slightly, at suggestions
that nothing of value to science is involved.
</P>
<P>
   The mission will test the effects of prolonged weightlessness on
an older human and, among other things, will deploy a device to
measure solar activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not child's play,'' Cronkite said. ``This is not a
vacation trip for John Glenn in any manner of speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite said the public has become blase about the space
shuttle flights. ``I think there's a whole generation out there,
the under-29ers, who are hardly aware that we're (set ital)in(end
ital) space,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those would be the same people, presumably, who have never seen
Cronkite anchor a live news event. If an 81-year-old semiretired
newsman can get cranked about space exploration, why not a
25-year-old?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's one of the great challenges we still face,''
Cronkite said. ``This is, other than the oceans, the last great
frontier. I can't imagine anyone (set ital)not(end ital) being
excited about it.''

LOW-PAID EMPLOYEES CAN STILL BE MOTIVATED

BY KEN LLOYD  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Many of the employees who work for us are in low-paying jobs,
and since we cannot do much with their pay, what else should we be
doing to keep them motivated and keep their turnover low? M.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Before putting pay aside and looking at other motivators, it
is important to pay attention to some key pay-related issues. For
example, you should have pay levels that are competitive for your
industry and area, along with internal consistency to prevent
instances such as paying new hires more than the experienced
long-termers. If issues of pay equity are not resolved,
motivational and retention programs will not motivate or retain
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   With issues of pay equity under control, you are most likely to
have a positive impact on motivation and retention through programs
that provide the employees with opportunities for recognition,
achievement, responsibility, advancement, and personal growth and
development. It also helps for the employees to see a definite
relationship between their performance and their pay.
</P>
<P>
   Within each of these categories, there are a number of questions
for management to answer. For example, are the employees receiving
adequate thanks and appreciation when merited by performance? Are
there real opportunities for education and self-development? Are
there advancement opportunities? Do the employees get to present
their ideas and suggestions in decision making that affects their
work?
</P>
<P>
   Positive answers to these types of questions will also provide a
positive answer to your question on employee motivation and
retention.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On most state and city job applications, a question is
whether you have been terminated from employment. Must you answer
yes if you stayed at the job for only 2 1/2 days, and both the
employer and later you realized it wasn't going to work out? J.M. &QL; 
A: Intentionally going blank on an application is only going to
create problems. The issue in this situation is how long a person
needs to stay on a job before it should be mentioned on an
application. The answer is that if you were hired into a given job
and the potential employer wants your employment history, that job
should be listed.
</P>
<P>
   If you omit the job, you are in essence saying that there is a
``grace period'' during which any previous jobs can be erased,
depending on their duration. Now, what is the appropriate duration?
If 2 1/2-day jobs can be deleted, what about jobs that last 2 1/2
weeks or months or even years? What about deleting any job that did
not go well? That is just what an employer would want to know if he
or she learns about this missing job.
</P>
<P>
   The best approach on a job application is to be honest. By
including a work situation that did not go well, you are indicating
to the potential employer that you are an honest, confident, open
and ethical individual who has probably learned something as a
result of the early termination.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if the employer happens to learn about that
disappearing job, you are destined to have another rapid departure.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have two new employees who report to me, and one is
frequently complaining about the other. Since it is so early in
their employment, I am wondering what to do about this. What do you
suggest? B.P.
</P>
<P>
   A: At this point, rather than wondering, the best step is to do
some wandering. Try to spend a little more time directly observing,
communicating and coaching both of these employees. You can also
meet with them individually and together in order to discuss
departmental projects, objectives and progress.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early for you to know if the complaining employee is a
classic complainer whose greatest source of job satisfaction is
going to management and launching diatribes about a co-worker, or
if this complainer is actually a dedicated employee who is highly
concerned about the questionable actions of a fellow employee. At
the same time, it is equally difficult to know if that fellow
employee is a good fellow who happens to be targeted by the
complainer, or if that fellow is a weak link who has been
spotlighted by the complainer.
</P>
<P>
   It may also be helpful for you to consider placing these
employees on a project or two in which they must work together. It
is possible that as they get to know and understand each other
better and communicate directly with each other about workplace
concerns, some of the sources of complaints may diminish.
</P>
<P>
   Using this approach, it will not take too much longer for you to
determine if the complaints are real problems or if the complainer
is the real problem. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Hope Mayo, a consultant to Christie's on ancient books, said
that the auction house enhanced only a few pages of the palimpsest
to show what could be done. A more thorough inspection will be the
responsibility of its future owner, she said, although the book may
be bought by someone unwilling to grant access to scholars.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a terrible loss,'' said Dr. Chris Rorres, a
mathematics professor at Drexel University and an amateur
Archimedes scholar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rigorous mathematical proofs devised by Archimedes have
come down to us from various sources, but only his `Method of
Mechanical Theorems,' recorded in this palimpsest alone, lets us
see how he arrived at his proofs. It is a bit like a structure in
which the scaffolding goes up first, then the building, and finally
the scaffolding is taken away, leaving only the final result.
Archimedes' `Method' is the only remnant of his work that lets us
see the scaffolding,'' Rorres said.
</P>
<P>
   The Archimedes ``method'' starts by experimenting with physical
objects and then looking for the abstract principles that underlie
their interactions. In his introduction to the Method, Archimedes
wrote: ``It is easier to supply the proof when we have previously
acquired, by the method, some knowledge of the questions than it is
to find it without any previous knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Roman writers who chronicled the life of
Archimedes, the mathematician was a devoted subject of Hiero II,
ruler of Syracuse, and spent part of his career designing and
building weapons to defend Syracuse _ catapults, pulley hoists and
levers for disabling enemy ships and siege towers. The ancient
historians Polybius, Plutarch and Pliny the Elder all mention such
inventions, although none was alive in Archimedes' lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Some Greco-Roman historians also assert that during the Roman
siege of Syracuse from 214 to 212 B.C., at the height of the Second
Punic War, Archimedes used bronze mirrors to focus sunlight on
Roman ships and set them on fire.
</P>
<P>
   This anecdote, among many others about Archimedes, has been
called into question by various scholars, although Dr. Ioannis
Sakkas, a Greek engineer, demonstrated in 1973 that the feat is
technically possible. With the help of 50 sailors holding 31
bronze-coated mirrors, he set fire to a wooden boat 160 feet
offshore.
</P>
<P>
   Many historians believe that Archimedes was not the inventor of
the Archimedes Screw, a rotary pump commonly used in Egypt for
irrigation. Rorres said, however, that there were no references to
the device in Egyptian texts prior to the time of Archimedes, and
that he therefore might have invented it.
</P>
<P>
   But another famous anecdote _ that Archimedes leapt naked from
his bathtub and ran through the streets of Syracuse shouting
``Eureka'' (``I have found it'') after solving a problem _ seems
unlikely. According to the story by the Roman architect Vitruvius,
Hiero asked Archimedes to examine a gold wreath intended to adorn
the statue of a goddess, and to determine whether the goldsmith had
adulterated the wreath with silver.
</P>
<P>
   In the Vitruvius version, Archimedes notices that when he steps
into a tub full to the brim with water, some water spills from the
tub. Vitruvius wrote that Archimedes placed a weight of pure gold
equal to the weight of the wreath in the tub and then filled the
tub to the brim. Archimedes then supposedly took out the gold and
replaced it with the wreath, reasoning that a wreath adulterated
with silver would occupy more volume than an equal weight of pure
gold, and would cause water to spill.
</P>
<P>
   But Rorres challenged this version, saying that the amount of
spillage would have been much too small to measure using the means
at Archimedes' disposal. Instead, Archimedes would probably have
invoked his own Law of Buoyancy and Law of the Lever, first
balancing the gold weight against the wreath in air and then
balancing the two objects in water. An imbalance in water would
clearly reveal adulteration, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Be that as it may, Archimedes scorned the practical devices he
designed as intellectually inferior to his mathematical theorems,
and none of his writing refers to devices or engineering. In his
will Archimedes asked that a cylinder circumscribing a sphere be
placed on his tomb, illustrating what he apparently considered the
most important geometrical relationship he had proved: that the
volume of a sphere is two-thirds that of a circumscribed cylinder
of the same dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of about 75, Archimedes was supposed to have been
sketching a geometric proof at the moment Roman troops under
Marcellus overran Syracuse in 212 B.C. and killed the Greek sage.
Marcellus apologized to Archimedes' relatives, and the
sphere-and-cylinder symbol was placed on his grave, where the Roman
politician Cicero sought and found it 137 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Byzantium, the successor of the Roman Empire in the eastern
Mediterranean, was the custodian of the Archimedes Palimpsest for
centuries, but Archimedes' admirers give the Romans little credit.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George F. Simmons of Colorado College, Colorado Springs,
commented in ``Calculus Gems'' that ``the Romans were so
uninterested in mathematics that Cicero's act in cleaning up
Archimedes' grave was perhaps the most memorable contribution of
any Roman to the history of mathematics.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathematicians hope the Archimedes Palimpsest will command more
respect by its new owners.

 WASHINGTON: 1996 campaign.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Asked about Rangel's comments, he said, ``Charlie is concerned
that when he is out motivating his troops he wants to say, `We're
going to win the majority back.' That's what you say when you're
out there on stump. But if I'm going to keep my credibility, I
can't give you campaign rhetoric and say, `that's my expectation.'
I want them to win a majority. That's just a hard reach.''
</P>
<P>
   In all but one midterm election since the Civil War, the party
of the president has lost ground in the House of Representative,
from two to 96 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Several House Democratic officials _ including backers of Rep.
Dick Gephardt, the minority leader, who is considering running for
president _ suggested that the White House was sitting on money so
the party would be well-positioned to help Gore run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Sosnik, a senior White House adviser, disputed that
Clinton has been inattentive to the financial needs of candidates.
``The president has spent a tremendous amount of time fund raising
on behalf of House and Senate candidates for the past two years,''
he said. ``If you have any doubts, look up how many articles have
been written about how much time he has spent going to fund
raisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another top White House official said the congressional
Democrats were too demanding _ and unrealistic. ``They're
whining,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``Everybody wants more money, and they're just looking
for someone to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the clashes are competing interests at the
highest levels of the Democratic Party. They are in some ways an
escalation of strains from 1994 when congressional Democrats
accused Clinton of costing them control of the House, and 1996,
when they said he did not do enough to help the party try to regain
the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that the leaders of the party can't get
together and agree on a single approach to these last weeks,'' said
Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster whose clients include Gephardt
and Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate Democratic leader.
``All these committees are united in wanting to help Democrats. But
the political imperatives work in different directions for
different elements of the Democratic Party, whether you're talking
about how money should be spent or how expectations should be
set.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several state Democratic leaders have also complained that they
need more money, particularly since the Republican Party has
outraised the Democrats by tens of millions of dollars in this
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never enough and we need more,'' said Art Torres,
chairman of the California Democratic Party. ``My only frame of
reference is '96. It was much more generous last time, but that was
a presidential year.'' Torres added that he understands ``it's
really tough when you're in the middle of a campaign to make sure
you take care of your party as well as the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   To compensate for the shortfall in fund raising for the Unity
program, the party took out a $3 million loan last month that was
divided between the campaign committees. But on a conference call
with Clinton last month, party officials said, Congressional
Democrats had asked for $8 million. Participating in the call, the
officials said, were Gephardt, Daschle and Frost.
</P>
<P>
   Romer said he has no apologies for not raising more money.
``We've put the well dry,'' he said, adding that banks refused to
loan the cash-strapped party any more money.
</P>
<P>
   But Rangel was not impressed. ``He's a nice person,'' he said of
the governor. ``When he's quiet.''

MEN FACE TESTS IN SUSPECTED RAPE OF COMATOSE WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROLINE LOUISE COLE   AND THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Mass. _ Investigators said Monday they are prepared to
issue subpoenas, if necessary, to test the DNA of men who
had &UR;  &LR; contact with the 24-year-old nursing-home patient who gave
birth last week despite having been in a comatose state for at
least three years.
</P>
<P>
   The tests could establish whether one of the men was the father
of the 5-day-old girl, who remains in critical condition at New
England Medical Center's Floating Hospital for Children. If the
father is discovered, authorities said, he would likely be charged
with rape..
</P>
<P>
   Steve O'Connell, spokesman for Essex County District Attorney
Kevin Burke, said police and prosecutors hope that men who had
contact with the woman will volunteer to be tested. But he added
that prosecutors are prepared to seek a judge's permission to
obtain samples from those who refuse to be tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``DNA testing is a several-weeks process, so we are asking
people to cooperate with the investigation,'' O'Connell said. ``But
should we deem it necessary as the investigation proceeds, we will
seek the necessary warrants from a judge for such testing. In order
to do that, we have to have probable cause.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said he believes many men, seeking to remove any
suspicion, will come forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't ruled anyone in or out,'' he said. ``We have to be
thorough.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who was 26 weeks pregnant, according to a State
Police investigator, delivered the baby Friday afternoon at
Lawrence General Hospital after going into premature labor at the
Town Manor Nursing and Rehabilitation Center. The mother is in
stable condition and recovering at the hospital, a hospital
spokeswoman said last night.
</P>
<P>
   The premature infant is to receive a state-appointed guardian
Tuesday because no relatives have assumed that role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a child abuse and neglect report, because of what you
might consider the unavailability of a caretaker,'' said Lorraine
Carli, spokeswoman for the state Department of Social Services.
``Absent a caretaker, DSS will step in and seek temporary
custody.''
</P>
<P>
   Carli said that no family members of the comatose woman, whose
pregnancy went unnoticed for at least five months, have sought
custody of the child.
</P>
<P>
   Carli said Monday the DSS will ``do an in-depth look at whether
there are relatives who could possibly be caretakers and step in to
make decisions on what's in the best interests of this
child.''Monday
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a State Police investigator and a spokeswoman for the
nursing home clashed Monday over how the pregnancy was first
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Trooper Joseph R. Galante said the first report of what
officials are considering a rape came when a ``low-level staffer''
at Town Manor called a state abuse hot line on Oct. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Goodman, a spokeswoman for Sunrise Healthcare Corp., the
New Mexico-based operator of Town Manor, called that account flatly
inaccurate, and said nursing home officials notified authorities
``in response to certain symptoms.'' Sunrise is a subsidiary of Sun
Healthcare Group.
</P>
<P>
   But Galante, who said the woman received severe brain injuries
in a 1995 automobile accident, said a caller to the hot line
reported that a nursing home patient had been taken to Holy Family
Hospital in Methuen because of an upper gastrointestinal infection,
and that the symptoms were determined to be a midterm pregnancy.
Sun Healthcare has said the patient was in a comatose state for
five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We immediately began a criminal investigation and discovered
the source was good and that the information was accurate,'' said
Galante.
</P>
<P>
   The state trooper is assigned to the Disabled Persons Protection
Commission, which operates a 24-hour hot line for anonymous abuse
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing we did was notify the Lawrence (Police
Department) detectives to bring them into the investigation,'' he
said. ``There is no question in my mind that this case would have
gone unreported if it weren't for the fact that since April we have
been looking at each complaint. The DPPC is a civil agency not
trained to assess criminal acts, which is why we are part of the
unit now. This is the real story.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said Town Manor, one of the 390 nursing homes nationwide
managed by her firm, is cooperating with the investigation but is
giving its employees no guidance about whether they should submit
to DNA sampling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an investigation that we're conducting,'' Goodman
said. ``We have to rely on the police and the district attorney's
office to make appropriate requests of anyone. People are sort of
jumping to conclusions here that this was (done by) an employee.''
</P>
<P>
   John Roberts, executive director of the American Civil Liberties
Union of Massachusetts, said if the DNA samples are voluntary, the
ACLU would not oppose them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think they need to go before a judge and get a warrant and
establish probable cause,'' said Roberts. ``But you have to be very
careful and you want to know who's going to have access to that
information. It should only be used for very narrow law-enforcement
purposes.''

COWBOYS SEEK A STREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys have not won three consecutive games
since late in the 1996 season. With Troy Aikman expected back in
uniform, they will be favored to break that trend with a stretch
run that begins in Philadelphia on ``Monday Night Football,''
passes through Texas Stadium against the New York Giants and ends
in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, Giants and Eagles have a combined 7-14 record.
Neither club has a rusher or passer ranked in the NFL's top 10. All
rank in the bottom third in scoring defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys (4-3) already have defeated the Cardinals and Giants
this season by a combined score of 69-17, but the Cowboys have only
one win in Philadelphia since the end of the 1994 season, a 23-19
victory in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a tough stretch because they are all NFC
East teams and we know each other well,'' Cowboys strong safety
Darren Woodson said. ``The Eagles will definitely be up for us.
They will come at us from all angles. We will have to be ready for
every trick play they throw at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Those plays have not worked well for the Eagles in 1998. They
are 1-6, with their only victory coming Oct. 11 against winless
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Eagles' record and Aikman's return after missing
the past five games with a fractured collarbone, Woodson said it is
important the Cowboys do not get overconfident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, especially with the young guys thinking \RAikman\S will
come back and save us,'' Woodson said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Aikman: ``Whatever problems we have we've still got to work
through them.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys get past this stretch of NFC East opponents
without a loss, their confidence should be sustained for the
late-November, early-December stretch that could ultimately decide
the team's season. The Cowboys are at home against Seattle and
Minnesota, and on the road against an improved New Orleans and
Kansas City during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The foursome has a winning record, combining for a 19-8 mark
(excluding the Chiefs' game last night) this season. The Cowboys
are unsuccessful against teams with winning records this season,
losing 42-23 at Denver and 13-12 against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys last defeated a team with a winning record Nov. 16,
when they knocked off the then 6-4 Redskins at Texas Stadium,
17-14.
</P>
<P>
   But the only thing the Cowboys are thinking about now are the
Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is the office answer, but the only thing on my
mind is Philadelphia,'' receiver Michael Irvin said. ``That's it.''

AT AT&AMP;T, COST-CUTTING LIFTS EARNINGS BUT REVENUE GROWTH REMAINS
LACKLUSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since C. Michael Armstrong took over as chairman of the AT&AMP;T
Corp. late last year, a pattern has emerged in the company's
financial results: aggressive cost-cutting leads to strong earnings
growth, but the company's revenue figures are tepid at best.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, the nation's largest communications company, stuck to that
script Monday as it announced results for the third quarter.
Propelled by a big reduction in costs, AT&AMP;T's net earnings grew by
more than two-thirds and modestly exceeded analysts' expectations,
but the company did not kick-start the overall growth of its
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has said that getting AT&AMP;T to grow at a rate
commensurate with the rest of the communications industry _ at
least 6 percent a year _ is crucial to the company's future.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, revenue appeared to grow in the third quarter by the
fastest rate in almost two years _ 4.3 percent _ to $13.7 billion
from $13.1 billion in the corresponding 1997 period. That is a big
improvement from the revenue gains posted in the first half: about
0.7 percent in the first quarter and 1.02 percent in the second.
</P>
<P>
   But a significant part of that 4.3 percent revenue gain resulted
from a one-time increase in the company's sales. During the third
quarter, AT&AMP;T began charging its residential customers a new flat
monthly fee as part of a federal plan to help cover the cost of
subsidizing communications services in poor and rural areas and for
schools and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   There appear to be no plans to increase the fees in the future,
so AT&AMP;T will have to look to its operations for continued growth.
</P>
<P>
   The company's main competitors, including MCI Worldcom Inc., are
charging similar fees, but they are growing faster than AT&AMP;T
anyway, so the new charge is not as big a part of their expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel P. Reingold, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.'s main
telecommunications analyst, told his company's clients Monday that
3 percentage points of AT&AMP;T's 4.3 percent growth figure was a
result of the new charges.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Monday declined to comment on the accuracy of that
calculation, but Armstrong agreed that the 4.3 percent figure did
not fully reflect the progress he has made in accelerating the
company's growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not satisfied with our revenue,'' he said.
``Operationally, we are improving in terms of revenue, but the
company did not pretend to say that the 4.3 percent figure was
operationally customer-generated revenue, because it wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   An AT&AMP;T spokeswoman would not say how much the company took in
with the new fees, but she said that AT&AMP;T passed the money on to
the government in the form of taxes, so the company's expenses
would also have appeared lower were the fee not in place.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, AT&AMP;T managed to post a 68 percent increase in
earnings, to $1.96 billion, or $1.09 a diluted share, up from $1.16
billion, or 65 cents a share, in the comparable period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding special charges and gains, the company's income from
continuing operations _ those that have not been sold or acquired _
increased 67 percent, to $1 a diluted share, up from 60 cents. That
beat the prediction of 95 cents a share by analysts polled by First
Call, a financial research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The strong earnings growth was largely a product of
cost-cutting. AT&AMP;T said it had cut more than 15,000 jobs this year
from a base of about 126,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Those cuts propelled a big drop in the company's selling,
general and administrative costs, to 24.4 percent of revenue from
29.8 percent of revenue in the comparable period a year earlier.
The company has said it plans to reduce those costs to 22 percent
of revenue by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T shares rose 43.75 cents Monday, to $64.25.

WORLD TRAVELERS SET UP AT CAPE CANAVERAL FOR LAUNCH OF GLENN,
SHUTTLE CREW 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a way, John Glenn and Houstonian Julia Riggs Day ended up at
the Kennedy Space Center on Monday for the same reason _ an
undiminished sense of adventure.
</P>
<P>
   The 68-year-old grandmother of seven, mother of four, left
Houston Oct. 23 with her Buick Roadmaster station wagon pushing
100,000 miles on the odometer and loaded to the brim with luggage
and boxes of items to pass along from her Houston family to her
Richmond, Va., family.
</P>
<P>
   But she happened to stop at the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame next
to the Kennedy Space Center. Now she might just stay until the
Thursday shuttle launch, to be part of history.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, 77, arrived in a NASA T-38 trainer jet to prepare for his
second launch into space, 36 years after his first.
</P>
<P>
   Day, who used to sign her Christmas cards ``Gypsy Julia,''
because her family moved so often with her former husband's job, is
rooting for her fellow voyager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been so excited about this,'' Day said. ``I think
(Glenn's) in incredible shape, and I think it's absolutely
marvelous. I envy him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of visitors from around the nation and the world,
Day wants to see the event for herself.
</P>
<P>
   Families and retirees are filling motels and campgrounds for
miles around the Kennedy Space Center this week, where a typical
welcome sign includes ``Godspeed John Glenn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Around here the hype is unbelievable,'' said Cape Kennedy KOA
Campground host Murray La Hue, who planned to head closer to the
coast Thursday to see the launch with his wife, Margherita.
</P>
<P>
   The pair fulfilled a dream in April by selling their home and
taking to the road in their recreational vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Winter Texan Herb James drove down alone from Prospect, Ohio, in
his 1980 VW van especially to see Glenn, his U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   The 66-year-old retired junior high teacher has clipped all the
newspaper articles and plans to find a good spot to watch the
launch. He brought along his collector's 1962 Glenn button, a bit
rusty now, to wear on launch day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's great PR for NASA,'' James said. ``People almost forgot
about NASA until they heard about a 77-year-old geezer going up.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm proud of what he's doing. I hope there's some medical
value coming out of what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Visitor Center, they came from around the globe, some
just lucky enough to catch launch week.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon and Maxine Morris and their two teen-age sons, Antony and
Sean, from Plymouth, England, were on a two-week holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exciting, very exciting,'' said Maxine Morris, 33, a
quality engineer in a factory. ``This is what we've been waiting
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Morris, 34, a submariner with the Royal Navy, said
excitement over the launch is non-existent back home. ``It seems to
be more of an American thing,'' he said. Added his wife: ``England
can't afford space.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Titusville Area Chamber of Commerce, longtime resident
Marcia Gaedcke can't remember the town so full of tourists and
space junkies. ``I don't think the return to flight in 1988 was as
big,'' said Gaedcke, referring to the first launch after the
shuttle Challenger disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions are that more than 250,000 people will view the
launch.
</P>
<P>
   Gaedcke, the special events coordinator and office manager for
the chamber, said her office has been bombarded with calls for
motels rooms, or just any place to stay. ``Rooms are booked as far
away as Orlando and beyond,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has been telling callers to find a spot along U.S. 1 in
Titusville as early as possible Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring a cooler, something to snack on, park it on a piece of
grass and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   For part-time Houstonian Day, (she lives six months of the year
with her son in Jersey Village, Texas, northwest of Houston) the
hoopla was all it took to change her plans. A retired marketing
director, Day visited her sister in Port St. Lucie over the weekend
and then drove to the U.S. Space Camp at the Hall of Fame to buy
T-shirts for the grand kids and get camp information to possibly
interest her 13-year old Jersey Village grandson.
</P>
<P>
   For $5 she had her photograph taken in the guise of a shuttle
commander. Then she had planned to drive on to Virginia, but by
late Monday was looking for a place to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am,'' She said. ``This is foolish to leave.'' &QL;

LOS ANGELES COUNTY HOME MARKET COOLS IN AUTUMN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mirroring a national trend, home sales slowed in
September from the August pace in Los Angeles County, but remained
well ahead of 1997 levels, an industry association has reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The number of previously owned homes sold in the county last
month fell 2 percent from August, and the median price dropped by 4
percent to $193,020, according to the California Association of
Realtors and Transamerica Intellitech, a real estate tracking firm.
</P>
<P>
   But there were still 6.5 percent more sales last month than in
September 1997, and the median price was 10.8 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a strong market, but slowing,'' said Leslie
Appleton-Young, chief economist for the Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials say growing concern about the nation's
economy is taking a toll on potential buyers. The Conference Board,
a New York-based private research group, said earlier this month
that consumer confidence in the economy fell in September for the
third consecutive month.
</P>
<P>
   Also depressing local sales is the shrinking variety of choices
available to buyers as the home supply dwindles. ``This market's
been going full speed ahead for two years, so inventory is low,''
Appleton-Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Even in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley area, which has a relatively
greater abundance of available homes, the shortage is being felt,
said Bud Mauro, president of the Southland Regional Association of
Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The low inventory is restricting our ability to fill the slots
for all these buyers,'' Mauro said. ``We don't have enough
inventory to show customers a good variety.''
</P>
<P>
   The California Association of Realtors maintains an index of
unsold inventory that roughly measures how long it would take to
sell all single-family homes available in a given market. A year
ago, the index stood at 6.1 months. In September, it was 5.4
months. ``And we really consider 10 to 12 months to be a balanced
market,'' Appleton-Young said.
</P>
<P>
   A local exception to the September decline is Ventura County,
where sales rose 5.5 percent from August and 5.6 percent from
September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, home sales also were down in September, though at 0.9
percent the decline was less dramatic than in Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in Los Angeles County, however, was less than the
7.7 percent drop in Santa Clara County, paced by its Silicon
Valley, and the San Francisco Bay Area's 4.3 percent fall. Year to
year, California home sales are up 9.3 percent, and the median
price of $204,630 is 6.8 percent ahead of the September 1997 level.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Realtors also released figures
Monday indicating sales of single-family homes fell in September
for the second consecutive month. Sales activity dropped 1.1
percent from August, but was ahead of September 1997 by 8.8
percent. &QL;

LOW-PAID EMPLOYEES CAN STILL BE MOTIVATED

BY KEN LLOYD  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Many of the employees who work for us are in low-paying jobs,
and since we cannot do much with their pay, what else should we be
doing to keep them motivated and keep their turnover low? M.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Before putting pay aside and looking at other motivators, it
is important to pay attention to some key pay-related issues. For
example, you should have pay levels that are competitive for your
industry and area, along with internal consistency to prevent
instances such as paying new hires more than the experienced
long-termers. If issues of pay equity are not resolved,
motivational and retention programs will not motivate or retain
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   With issues of pay equity under control, you are most likely to
have a positive impact on motivation and retention through programs
that provide the employees with opportunities for recognition,
achievement, responsibility, advancement, and personal growth and
development. It also helps for the employees to see a definite
relationship between their performance and their pay.
</P>
<P>
   Within each of these categories, there are a number of questions
for management to answer. For example, are the employees receiving
adequate thanks and appreciation when merited by performance? Are
there real opportunities for education and self-development? Are
there advancement opportunities? Do the employees get to present
their ideas and suggestions in decision making that affects their
work?
</P>
<P>
   Positive answers to these types of questions will also provide a
positive answer to your question on employee motivation and
retention.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On most state and city job applications, a question is
whether you have been terminated from employment. Must you answer
yes if you stayed at the job for only 2 1/2 days, and both the
employer and later you realized it wasn't going to work out? J.M. &QL; 
A: Intentionally going blank on an application is only going to
create problems. The issue in this situation is how long a person
needs to stay on a job before it should be mentioned on an
application. The answer is that if you were hired into a given job
and the potential employer wants your employment history, that job
should be listed.
</P>
<P>
   If you omit the job, you are in essence saying that there is a
``grace period'' during which any previous jobs can be erased,
depending on their duration. Now, what is the appropriate duration?
If 2 1/2-day jobs can be deleted, what about jobs that last 2 1/2
weeks or months or even years? What about deleting any job that did
not go well? That is just what an employer would want to know if he
or she learns about this missing job.
</P>
<P>
   The best approach on a job application is to be honest. By
including a work situation that did not go well, you are indicating
to the potential employer that you are an honest, confident, open
and ethical individual who has probably learned something as a
result of the early termination.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if the employer happens to learn about that
disappearing job, you are destined to have another rapid departure.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have two new employees who report to me, and one is
frequently complaining about the other. Since it is so early in
their employment, I am wondering what to do about this. What do you
suggest? B.P.
</P>
<P>
   A: At this point, rather than wondering, the best step is to do
some wandering. Try to spend a little more time directly observing,
communicating and coaching both of these employees. You can also
meet with them individually and together in order to discuss
departmental projects, objectives and progress.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early for you to know if the complaining employee is a
classic complainer whose greatest source of job satisfaction is
going to management and launching diatribes about a co-worker, or
if this complainer is actually a dedicated employee who is highly
concerned about the questionable actions of a fellow employee. At
the same time, it is equally difficult to know if that fellow
employee is a good fellow who happens to be targeted by the
complainer, or if that fellow is a weak link who has been
spotlighted by the complainer.
</P>
<P>
   It may also be helpful for you to consider placing these
employees on a project or two in which they must work together. It
is possible that as they get to know and understand each other
better and communicate directly with each other about workplace
concerns, some of the sources of complaints may diminish.
</P>
<P>
   Using this approach, it will not take too much longer for you to
determine if the complaints are real problems or if the complainer
is the real problem. &QL;

Audra McDonald at the Public Theater. The 28-year-old actress with
a mezzo-soprano, a presence and a power that many say come along
once in a lifetime has been lavishly praised in recent months. In
his review in The New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote that,
because of her versatile voice, ``a better musical future seems not
only possible but upon us, right here, right now.'' (Sara

10-26 -- Israeli police and soldiers try Monday to pursuade a
Jewish settler to leave the area on a road near where a fellow

-- A millennium-old volume of 10th-century writings by Archimedes,
defaced by mildew and scorched around the edges, will go on the

SCI-ELDERLY-ASTRONAUTS-3, 10-26 -- JoAnn Spickelmier, 84, helped by
Max Murray, tries out a fighter jet simulator in Elderhostel's

piqued by this week's scheduled return to space by Sen. John Glenn,
who at 77 will become the oldest person to orbit the Earth. ``Most
of us would go if we had the chance,'' Mrs. Spickelmier says of
Glenn. ``He's in good shape and should make it just fine.'' (David

10-26 -- Teri Williams runs in a hypoxic chamber at the Sporting
Club in Irvine, which reduces the oxygen to a level equivalent to
an 8,500 foot elevation. Contrary to long ingrained beliefs, a team

living a more sedentary life at high altitude while doing the bulk
of their training at a lower altitude. (Robert Burroughs/New York

   STOCKS MIXED AS GLITCH INTERRUPTS BIG BOARD ACTION
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices ended mixed in relatively subdued trading as a
rally in European exchanges and better-than-expected earnings
reports from a number of companies lifted shares early in the day
before investors took profits. The Dow Jones industrial average
fell 20.08 points, or 0.2 percent, to 8,432.21.
</P>
<P>
   However, broader market averages did better, and small-cap
stocks continued to rally. In the Treasury market, bond prices rose
for the first time in seven sessions as the yield fell to 5.11
percent from 5.17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A computer glitch forced the New York Stock Exchange to halt
trading for nearly an hour, interrupting trading at stock and
futures exchanges across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ECONOMIC CRISIS HITS SILICON VALLEY
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley has been hit by a one-two punch from forces
originating thousands of miles away. The Asian economic crisis has
slowed exports, causing a cascade of layoffs. And the stock-market
volatility has battered technology-company shares, making it harder
for young companies to raise money and crimping the spending of
workers whose sense of wealth is tied to stock options.
</P>
<P>
   SUN TO RELEASE NEW SOLARIS VERSION
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems plans to release a new version of its Solaris
operating system to capitalize on delays in Microsoft's newest
version of its Windows NT operating system.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T POSTS 68 PERCENT RISE IN EARNINGS
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T said third-quarter earnings rose 68 percent to a record as
the largest U.S. long-distance phone company cut costs and
bolstered sales at the fastest rate in almost two years.
</P>
<P>
   DOW JONES SEEKS TO RAISE PROFITS
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year after swallowing a $1 billion loss from its
unsuccessful venture into financial information services, Dow
Jones, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, announced a
three-year plan intended to increase earnings 10 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST DAY ON THE JOB AT NBC
</P>
<P>
   NBC officially put Scott Sassa in place as the executive who
will lead the network's entertainment division in the future, and
Sassa said he intended to throw himself immediately into developing
programs, because ``finding hit shows is what keeps this business
going.''
</P>
<P>
   TELIGENT READY FOR BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
   Alex Mandl, who resigned as president of AT&AMP;T in 1996, hopes to
make a triumphant return to the forefront of the telecommunications
industry as his new company, Teligent, announces that it is open
for business in 10 of the United States' largest markets.
</P>
<P>
   GM SHAKES UP OPEL MANAGEMENT
</P>
<P>
   Just four months after General Motors installed Gary Cowger as
chairman of Adam Opel AG, its most important European subsidiary,
officials at the automaker confirmed that they were transferring
him back to Detroit and replacing him with Robert Hendry, who runs
Saab AB, the Swedish carmaker, in which GM owns a controlling
stake.
</P>
<P>
   DAIMLER AVOIDS ACCOUNTING CHARGES
</P>
<P>
   Daimler-Benz said its shareholders had swapped 97 percent of
their shares in the company into stock of the forthcoming
DaimlerChrysler, enabling the company to avoid accounting charges
of $33.5 billion as it buys Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   DAIWA TO CUT SALARIES BY 10 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Two days after announcing the closing of its overseas branches,
Japan's ninth-largest lender, Daiwa Bank, said it planned to cut
employees' salaries by 10 percent and focus on business in its home
city of Osaka.
</P>
<P>
   HOME RESALES FELL IN SEPTEMBER
</P>
<P>
   Home resales fell in September for a second straight month,
suggesting that low mortgage rates are not enough to overcome an
overall slowing of the U.S. economy.

BACK PEACE, U.S. URGES ARAB ALLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

   WASHINGTON _ Now that the Wye conference has broken the 19-month
deadlock between the Israelis and the Palestinians, the Clinton
administration is urging moderate Arab nations to recommit
themselves to actively aiding the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, administration officials are saying that moderate
Arab states like Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Qatar and Saudi Arabia
should move quickly to support the Palestinian Authority. They
suggest building projects and job creation, as well as new efforts
to bring Israel into the region and involvement in groups looking
into regional problems like the water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu and Arafat signed an interim deal on Friday that will
return another 13 percent of the West Bank to at least partial
Palestinian control in exchange for specific Palestinian steps to
fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Rubin, spokesman for Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, said on Monday, ``Secretary Albright does believe that
with the Middle East peace process now invigorated, Arab states
should do more to normalize relations with Israel, assist the
Palestinians economically where possible and participate in the
multilateral tracks of the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is annoyed that Arab leaders are now reluctant
to fully endorse the deal squeezed out of the parties in nine long
days at Wye. The annoyance is particularly acute given that Arab
countries earlier criticized Washington for not pressing Netanyahu
enough, and dropped out of regional economic initiatives like a
conference last year in Doha, Qatar.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to wait and see if the deal is implemented,'' a
senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Official reaction from these nations has been cautious, and the
Egyptian foreign minister, Amr Moussa, has repeated the
wait-and-see stance directly to Albright, officials said. There was
a similar response Monday when the assistant secretary of state for
near east affairs, Martin Indyk, met with some 20 Arab ambassadors,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, one official said, ``Prime Minister Netanyahu
made some hard decisions in the last week, and they have to stop
blaming him and start thinking about what their responsibilities
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Both ordinary Palestinians and ordinary Israelis need to see the
benefits of peace, the official emphasized, and that means jobs in
the first case and normalization and security in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Albright has also been concerned about the deterioration of
American influence on moderate Arab states, stemming from their
anger over the peace stalemate. In particular, the United States
has had a hard time getting these states to support its policies
toward both Iran and Iraq. Now that Washington has unblocked the
peace process, officials say, it is time for a bit of payback.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, officials from the Central Intelligence Agency,
including the station chief in Israel, briefed the House and Senate
intelligence committees on the role the CIA will play under the
Middle East peace accord. Some lawmakers and aides had expressed
alarm at reports coming out of the Wye negotiations on CIA
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pact, the CIA's tasks will include refereeing disputes
on the handling of terrorist suspects, and monitoring those
arrested and jailed by Israeli and Palestinian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In separate, closed briefings before the House and Senate
panels, CIA officials played down any new responsibilities, and
emphasized that the agreement outlines a continuation of
peacekeeping duties performed by the agency over for the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   After the briefings, aides expressed relief. ``There was very,
very little new here,'' said one congressional participant.
``What's new is all the publicity surrounding it.''

TRAVEL SCAMS TOP LIST OF FRAUDS IN ARI ZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   PHOENIX _ High pressure tactics that lead nowhere. Travel
packages that never materialize. Discount cards that don't work.
Those and other complaints have propelled travel to the top of the
list of consumer complaints in Arizona, replacing motor-vehicle
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance phone service scams are second on the list, the
Arizona Attorney General's office reported Monday. Auto complaints
come in third.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, the office had received 661 written complaints
this year about travel clubs and agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The travel-related complaints sadden but don't surprise Bonnie
Harry, who until last week was president of the Arizona American
Society of Travel Agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had more inquiries this year than I've ever had,'' she
said. Since July, she has taken 150 to 200 calls from people
victimized by travel scams, or from people checking on companies
offering deals that look too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the complaints involved one discount travel company,
Ultima Systems Inc., whose presentations created the false
impression that travelers would always save substantial amounts of
money, reported Sydney Davis, chief counsel for the Attorney
General's consumer protection division.
</P>
<P>
   After the division stepped in, the company agreed to change its
presentation, and Ultima is negotiating with former customers, she
said. Ultima hasn't admitted any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints reveal that some consumers have paid discount travel
companies hundreds or thousands of dollars to get discount cards,
supposedly up to 75 percent off at airlines, car rental companies
and hotels, only to find that the discounts were not available or
were offered at very limited times, with reservations made far in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the scams involve older people who have more time to
travel, Harry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are enticed because many are on a budget and are looking
for deals to stretch their travel dollars. They are accustomed to
doing business on a handshake and tend to be less suspicious than
younger travelers. Many seniors still want to believe everyone out
there is honest,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Attorney General received 462 complaints about long-distance
companies and 431 regarding car repairs. Some of the phone
complaints involve ``slamming'' _ where long-distance service is
switched without people's knowledge. This can happen when they sign
up for a chance to get a prize at a mall or a fair, but don't see
the fine print on the back that allows a company to switch their
long-distance carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Other complaints involve ``cramming,'' where unscrupulous
companies add charges to phone bills for services that were never
authorized or received.
</P>
<P>
   The standard advice for consumers, from the Phoenix Better
Business Bureau, is to check your phone bill carefully every month.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods released the list of top
complaints Monday at a conference on telemarketing fraud and mail
solicitation at the Herberger Auditorium in Phoenix. The conference
was sponsored by the Attorney General's office, the Department of
Gerontology at Arizona State University and AARP.
</P>
<P>
   The travel scams often begin with an invitation to a meeting to
receive a gift such as a night or two of lodging. High pressure
tactics are used at the meeting to sell travel packages. The
packages are usually described as being available only at that
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Travel packages are an ideal scam because the travel is usually
scheduled far enough in the future to give the con artists time to
disappear, Harry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These customers are paying thousands of dollars and walking
away with nothing except promises that in five months they are
going on a trip,'' Harry said. Even if the trip is for real, there
are often major disappointments: A promised room overlooking the
beach can instead have a view of an alley.
</P>
<P>
   If you are dealing with a reputable company, Harry said, they
can make adjustments to make your trip enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   Legitimate travel packages usually have a reasonable travel
cancellation plan and are not offered on a take-it-or-leave-it
basis on one evening.
</P>
<P>
   Woods recommends checking with the Phoenix Better Business
Bureau or the Attorney General's Office before putting out big
money to a business you aren't familiar with. Don't give any
unsolicited caller your bank card number, credit card, Social
Security number or other personal information. The warning extends
to Internet transactions.
</P>
<P>
   If you are offered a great deal, Harry recommends that you
compare the price by calling local travel agents. They may have
comparable packages with much better guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   While travel and other scams are targeted to retirees, there are
plenty of scams to go around for other age groups, including a
growing number of investment scams targeted to middle-age workers
beginning to prepare for retirement, said Daniel Drake, assistant
U.S. Attorney in the Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any situation _ investments, funeral planning, college
scholarships, job placement _ where money is required up front,
watch your wallet,'' said Ruth Zemek, director of trade practices
for the Phoenix Better Business Bureau. ``The larger the sum, the
more important it is to do some research.''
</P>
<P>
   If someone says you have to buy before you leave the room, do
leave the room, Zemek said. &QL;

IN CALIFORNIA RACE, LOCAL ISSUES SUPERSEDE CLINTON SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: Also sent in ``a'' category) 
(mk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. _ Last winter, when Lois Capps
decisively won a special congressional election to finish the term
of her late husband, Walter, in this swing district on California's
central coast, politicians of both parties all but wrote off her
Republican opponent, Assemblyman Tom Bordonaro, as a hopeless case
for this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But the ground shifted with President Clinton's August
confession of an improper relationship with Monica Lewinsky, and
this congressional race suddenly seemed symptomatic of evolving
voter sentiment in a volatile election year.
</P>
<P>
   When the Capps campaign took its first poll of the fall season,
just before the release of Kenneth Starr's report in early
September, it found Bordonaro and Mrs. Capps in a dead heat. A
Bordonaro poll two weeks later confirmed the trend, with Mrs. Capps
holding the barest edge, 45 percentage points to 42, and more than
half the voters in the district viewing the president unfavorably.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after Congress' release of the second batch of Starr
documents three weeks ago, including transcripts of conversations
between Ms. Lewinsky and Linda Tripp, the ground shifted again, and
Mrs. Capps' polling showed her with a clear, though not conclusive,
lead. And Thursday night, when Bordonaro gently chided the
moderator of a debate in nearby Atascadero that one question about
the Lewinsky matter was enough, the bipartisan audience exploded in
applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear for a time that this was being viewed through a
very partisan prism, and now I think a lot of that's receded,''
said Mrs. Capps' media adviser, Bill Carrick. ``We've gone through
the angry Republican period and we've gone through the angry
Democratic period, and now we're having a normal midterm
election.''
</P>
<P>
   In a district that was viewed as a national bellwether because
its special election was the first congressional contest of the
year, the lesson now seems to be the oldest one of all:
Lewinsky-mania notwithstanding, all politics is still local. The
issue in the 22nd Congressional District these days is not
impeachment so much as education, health care and Highway 46, the
heavily traveled two-lane road that connects this rural coastal
stretch of the district with the vital inland artery Interstate 5.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, while the effect of the Beltway's drama of sex, lies and
videotape has clearly been felt here, the 22nd District seems about
what it usually is: a rough electoral microcosm of California, with
its blend of suburban Santa Barbara and rural San Luis Obispo, its
liberal software-crunchers and conservative cow-punchers, where
many listeners at Thursday night's debate wore boots and hats and
at least one young woman wore studs pierced through her nose, lips
and cheek.
</P>
<P>
   This election is the fourth face-off in nine months between Mrs.
Capps and Bordonaro, a conservative former grape farmer and tax
preparer who upset the preferred choice of his party elders, the
moderate Assemblyman Brooks Firestone, in the first round of the
special election to fill the vacancy, in January. He then lost to
Mrs. Capps in a runoff in March, before facing her again in the
June ``blanket'' primary, in which all candidates' names appear on
the ballot regardless of party. He is now running television
advertisements that accuse Mrs. Capps of being soft on crime and
weak on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Capps, a former school nurse whose husband won the seat for
the Democrats in 1996 for the first time in 50 years and then died
of a heart attack last fall, is running commercials that note her
support for school construction and styling herself as
``independent and mainstream'' in an effort to play down her
liberal credentials in a district almost evenly divided between
registered Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a real hard time,'' said Mary Chambers, a
Republican who is running for the City Council in Bordonaro's
hometown, Paso Robles, but who has also led a citizens campaign to
``Fix 46,'' the state highway where James Dean died in a crash in
1955. Ms. Chambers said at the debate that she was deeply grateful
that Mrs. Capps won some $8 million in federal money to help widen
the road. ``I'm for Tom, I'm a registered Republican. But she's
been right there for us, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Bordonaro, an upbeat campaigner who has been in a wheelchair
since a car accident in college left him a paraplegic with limited
use of his arms, is quick to say that Clinton's problems helped
galvanize his cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helped people become a little more introspective,
and let them focus again on what they really thought about our
race,'' he said after the debate. ``It's kind of given Republicans
a rallying point.''
</P>
<P>
   Bordonaro needed a rallying point. His challenge to Firestone,
who was the choice of former President Ford, Speaker Newt Gingrich
and other national Republicans, so irked party leaders that they
stayed away last winter, and Firestone supporters actually
contributed names from his fund-raising rolls to Mrs. Capps in the
March runoff. The national Republican Party was reluctant to invest
too much more in him after Mrs. Capps defeated him with 53 percent
of the vote to his 45.
</P>
<P>
   But by late summer, when Bordonaro suddenly seemed within
striking distance, Republicans from former Vice President Dan
Quayle to Steve Forbes to Gingrich came trooping to the district.
And the Republican National Congressional Committee, the party's
congressional fund-raising arm, has given him the maximum allowable
contribution of $63,000 to help defray coordinated campaign
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Capps, eager to emphasize her local support, has asked the
Democratic National Campaign Committee not to make a similar
contribution, though she tops the list of congressional recipients
of contributions from labor political action committees, with
$222,900, according to a study by the National Legal and Policy
Center, a research group in Washington.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, interest groups have stayed largely on the sidelines, in
contrast to the special elections, when they spent hundreds of
thousands of dollars on advertising to make their point on issues
from late-term abortion to congressional term limits.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, Bordonaro's challenge was to run against a grieving
widow without seeming mean. Now he faces an incumbent who has done
much to consolidate her support throughout the district, for
example winning the endorsement of Bordonaro's hometown newspaper,
The Telegram-Tribune of San Luis Obispo, which had backed him in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Capps said she always assumed the race would be
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even actually sure that it wasn't always tight,'' she
said. ``We just happened to take that poll right before the Starr
report came out, which turned out to be a good time to take a
sounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Capps' campaign manager, Cathy Duvall, said the ups and
downs of the race were understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to see why things would be so volatile,'' she said.
``Congress voting for impeachment hearings is not an everyday
thing. It throws the public for a loop and then us, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear that the national climate has made this race
more partisan, activating a number of Republicans who want to make
sure they can impeach the president but also activating Democrats
who saw what the Judiciary Committee was doing as way too
partisan,'' Ms. Duvall said. ``I think the wagons are coming home
for both parties.''

   LOS ANGELES _ If USC fails to win two of its final four games,
the Trojans will accomplish something that hasn't happened to them
for more than 30 years. They will be the first team since the
mid-1960s to go three consecutive seasons without making a bowl
game.
</P>
<P>
   The last time USC went three seasons without going to a bowl
game was from 1963-65 under John McKay. But it's a little
misleading to compare those Trojans to more recent USC squads,
because in those days only the conference champion went to a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The 1963 team went 7-3 and finished second in the conference.
The 1964 team also went 7-3 and tied for first in the conference,
but Oregon State was selected as the representative for the Rose
Bowl. The 1965 team was 7-2-1 and finished second.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, last year's Trojans could also quibble with possibly
being part of a dubious accomplishment. The Trojans were actually
bowl eligible at 6-5, but university president Steven Sample nixed
an opportunity for USC to play in the Las Vegas Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have daunting schedule to try to pick up at least
two more victories: they host Washington on Saturday; play at
Stanford; at No. 2-ranked UCLA and host No. 16-ranked Notre Dame to
end the season.
</P>
<P>
   Changing of the guard: With little fanfare, junior college
transfer Donta Kendrick started in place of Jason Grain at left
guard against Oregon. Grain apparently lost his job because of his
practice performances last week, although he is still officially
listed as the starter on the Trojans' depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   The fullback position is open again, as coach Paul Hackett said
either Marvin Powell or Ted Iacenda will start. Powell won the job
last week for the first time this season, but both played against
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback keeper: Oregon quarterback Akili Smith's 62-yard
touchdown run turned out to be the longest touchdown run by an
opposing quarterback in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame quarterback Tony Rice had a 65-yarder in 1988 against
the Trojans in the Irish's 27-10 victory.
</P>
<P>
   No change at QB: Hackett said he will continue to start Mike Van
Raaphorst at quarterback, although freshman Carson Palmer played
the majority of Saturday's game against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Day game at The Farm: The USC-Stanford game in Palo Alto on Nov.
7 will begin at either 12:30 p.m. or 3:30 p.m. A decision will be
announced next Monday.

LAWRENCE TAYLOR ENTERS DRUG CLINIC, LAWYER SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (ll) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just over one week after his second arrest in three years on
crack-cocaine charges, former Giant linebacker Lawrence Taylor
checked into a drug rehabilitation clinic in New Jersey on Monday
night, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that Lawrence checked himself in on
Monday,'' said lawyer Thomas Melani. ``Any time a drug addict gets
positive reinforcement, it's a good thing. I think he had to do it
and I'm glad he did it. I think it's good for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Melani said he did not personally see Taylor go into the clinic,
but received assurances that the former Giants star had indeed went
to a rehabilitation center that Melani would not identify.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor told people close to him goodbye on Monday morning and
said he would be at the clinic for 30 to 60 days; Melani said
Taylor would probably stay for 30 days. Efforts to reach Taylor by
telephone at his home during the day were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was arrested at 2 a.m. on Oct. 19 in a St. Petersburg
Beach, Fla., hotel room where the police said he tried to buy $50
worth of crack cocaine from an undercover officer. There were 15
crack pipes inside the room, according to the police. Taylor has
maintained that he was set up by the police and within the last few
days, his lawyer said, took a lie-detector test that he claimed
proved his version of events was true.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was arrested two years ago in Myrtle Beach, S.C., for
allegedly trying to buy $100 worth of fake crack cocaine from an
undercover officer. His record in that case was wiped clean after
he undertook 60 hours of community service and submitted to drug
counseling and random drug testing.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Taylor pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in
Camden, N.J., to filing a false federal income tax return by
failing to report $48,000 in income from a restaurant, near Giants
Stadium, that is now closed.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum sentence for his offense is three years in federal
prison and a $250,000 fine, but Taylor is expected to receive
probation because he cooperated with federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor was apparently told by federal prosecutors after his
arrest last week that his latest troubles could mean a violation of
the plea-agreement and that if Taylor did not receive drug
counseling immediately he would very be likely to face jail time.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has been in and out of rehabilitation clinics over much
of his football career and even after he retired from football in
1993. He underwent rehabilitation for a cocaine problem in 1986,
but two years later was suspended by the National Football League
for violating the league's substance abuse policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have paid for several stints to such clinics for
Taylor since he retired, said Giant officials who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. The team, especially owner Wellington Mara
and many of Taylor's close friends remain very concerned about his
health.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, the Giants' career sack leader and perhaps the best
linebacker ever, is eligible for entrance into the Pro Football
Hall of Fame in January.
</P>
<P>
   Melani, the lawyer, said: ``I think a lot of people are
concerned about Lawrence and he appreciates it very much, of
course. I think right now Lawrence wants to work on his problems
and be alone for a while. He wants to correct his life and he's
working hard at it.''

LONG TALKS SUGGEST NBA SEASON COULD RESUME 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A marathon negotiating session in the National
Basketball Association's labor dispute produced some signs of
progress Monday toward a belated start to the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some minor progress,'' said one participant in
the meeting, who spoke midway through the negotiating session on
condition of anonymity. ``But it's unclear whether we're going
anywhere or not on the major issues.''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 members of the union, including the players'
association president, Patrick Ewing, and 12 other players, met
with NBA commissioner David Stern, deputy commissioner Russ Granik
and 10 other representatives from the league. During a session one
participant called the most productive talks since the lockout
began July 1, the sides gathered at a midtown hotel in negotiations
that continued into the night.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came one day before the league's labor relations
committee was scheduled to meet in Manhattan to discuss the
stalemate that has led to the cancellation of the first two weeks
of the season. Barring a major compromise that would lead to the
signing of a new collective bargaining agreement, the NBA is
planning to announce more cancellations Wednesday or Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday night, there had been no substantive negotiations
since Oct. 13. But Stern and Granik met with the union's chief
negotiators, the executive director Billy Hunter and Ewing, for
three and one half hours on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The second meeting in three days is indicative of the growing
concern over lost games and the potential for losing the entire
season should the dispute continue.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the negotiating session represents the first step in
hammering out an agreement remains to be seen. But the fact that
both sides were talking for more than six hours produced some rare
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   The chances that Stern and Granik would bring proposals to the
nine-member ownership committee Tuesday seemed to grow as the
session continued. But before 9 o'clock Monday night, neither side
had agreed on a concept to bring salaries in line with revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have indicated flexibility on many of the key
economic issues that have held up previous negotiations, including
a salary cap without exceptions. There was also discussion about
the feasibility of a tax system, a mechanism that has been bandied
about by both sides in prior proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The owners want cost certainty, while the players have
maintained that they want to keep their right to earn as much as
they can through a clause known as the Larry Bird exception.
</P>
<P>
   Modifications to the clause were discussed. Also, another
participant in the meeting said, both sides have talked openly
about raising the minimum salary for veterans with 10 or more years
of experience to above $750,000. The minimum salary last season was
$272,500, a figure that 20 percent of players had to settle for
after many of the upper-echelon salaries were doled out.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the Larry Bird exception, the players were adamant
about improving the salaries for middle-class players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say there is actually movement, although the day is
not at its conclusion,'' said the participant in the meeting.
``It's not clear whether the two sides appear to be in a
back-and-forth session that may result a deal. But you could say
this was at the least minor progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Ewing, union vice presidents Herb Williams, Jim
McIlvaine, Mitch Richmond and Dikembe Mutombo attended the meeting,
as did Steve Smith, Antonio Davis, Danny Schayes, Sam Mitchell, Ray
Allen and Michael Curry.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's meeting of the NBA board of governors could be a key
date in the negotiation process. Hunter said he had invited all
400-plus members of his union to attend the talks, which will also
include owners and ownership representatives from the league's 29
teams.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 240 players convened in Las Vegas last Thursday to
proclaim that they would not accept a hard salary cap under any
terms and that they planned to make whatever provisions necessary
for a long and bitter fight with the owners, if need be.

NEW POLL, NEW MATH, AND THAT OLD COLLEGE TRY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a new poll, a new No. 1 and some new math for
gridiron-ologists to digest as college football marches on to the
bowl season and, presumably an undisputed national champion. The
Bowl Championship Series has released its first ranking and the
UCLA Bruins are on top.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Ohio State might have won the hearts and minds, as well
as the top ranking of news media members and coaches in each's
respective poll, but the Buckeyes apparently do not interface well
with computers. Each of the three computer services used in the BCS
formula _ including the New York Times computer ranking _ chose the
Bruins as No. 1 and helped push them past Ohio State in the new
ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't matter to me whether we are ranked first or
second in the BCS poll,'' said UCLA Coach Bob Toledo. ``The
important thing is to have a chance to play in the championship
game and you can do that being ranked first or second.''
</P>
<P>
   The BCS ranking is in place to insure that a clear-cut No. 1 and
No. 2 team will meet for a national championship game, this season
at the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4. It compiles the poll placements, the
computer rankings, puts a numerical value on strength of schedule
and factors in a team's number of losses. In theory, never again
will an undefeated Michigan team and an undefeated Nebraska team
each win a national championship, as was the case last season.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA (6-0) earned a 3.04 point value in the ranking: 2 points
for poll average, 1 for computer average, 0.04 for strength of
schedule and 0 for losses. The Bruins were rewarded for playing
what the ranking determined as the nation's toughest schedule _ its
opponents are a combined 27-10 and include two BCS ranked teams,
No. 11 Oregon and No. 14 Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State earned 4.31 points _ one for poll average, 2.67 for
computer average, 0.64 for strength of schedule and 0 for losses.
They were penalized for what the formula determined was only the
16th best schedule (27-15 opponents' record) in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't worry about the BCS rating just like we can't worry
about our rankings in the national polls,'' said Ohio State Coach
John Cooper. ``I can say that we are happy to be ranked as high as
we are in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been the No. 1 team in both the major polls all season
and we're just going to keep working hard to try to win football
games. Winning takes care of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The point differential to the BCS' No. 3 and No. 4 teams bears
out Cooper's contention that, softer schedule or not, Ohio State
will play in the national title game if it remains undefeated. That
is because the news media and coaches polls still carry great
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (6-0), for example, earned a 6.50 point value despite
playing what the BCS ranking says is the nation's second-toughest
schedule. The Vols have beaten the BCS's No. 7 team Florida, No. 13
Georgia and No. 20 Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Still, because Tennessee is ranked No. 3 by the news media and
No. 4 by the coaches gives the Vols 3.50 points in the poll
component alone, which is higher than UCLA's final tally of 3.04.
No. 4 Kansas State (7-0) is even further in the hole, 8.79 points,
because of its 3.50 poll value and the points it is assessed for
playing the nation's 49th-ranked schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ranking is intended to separate the best two teams from
the rest and make sure they face each other,'' said the BCS's
associate coordinator, Mark Womack. ``Nothing more.''
</P>
<P>
   The ranking will be released each Monday for the next six weeks
until Dec. 6, when they will be calculated for a final time and the
Fiesta Bowl matchup will be set. The ranking will have a
significant impact on the Rose, Sugar and Orange Bowls _ each of
which will be host to the title game on a rotating basis.
</P>
<P>
   First, each bowl will honor its commitments to its conference
tie-ins on the years the bowl is not playing host to the
championship game. If the season were to end today, for example,
Southeastern Conference champion and the BCS's No. 3 Tennessee
would go to the Sugar Bowl. The Orange Bowl would choose between
the Atlantic Coast and Big East champion, probably selecting No. 5
Florida State over No. 20 Syracuse. And the Rose Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   This year, the game playing host to the Big Ten and Pacific 10
champions _ Ohio State and UCLA _ would lose that marquee matchup
to the Fiesta Bowl, if the ranking stands. But organizers would get
the first two at-large picks and the chance for a dream matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Who is eligible for the the two at large berths?
</P>
<P>
   In the current ranking, all 20 teams because Syracuse is the
lowest-ranked BCS-affiliated conference leader. Jack French, the
Rose Bowl's executive director, relished the thought of picking
from such an attractive field. Kansas State, for example, would be
available because the Big 12 champion usually has an automatic
berth in the Fiesta. Imagine the Wildcats against No. 7 Florida. Or
how about an undefeated No. 9 Wisconsin against No. 11 Oregon to
stay in the Rose tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's No. 16 Notre Dame. The Irish haven't been to the
Rose Bowl since 1925 and could take on any of the aforementioned
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time we've had to do it and I find it
entertaining,'' said French. ``We have people talking about us. It
would be fun to have a greater mix of people on the West Coast.''

EX-SOUTH AFRICAN LEADERS WERE BEHIND CRIMES, PANEL TO REPORT 
THIS IS A RESEND TO FIX MISSING WORDS IN LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BEN BRADLEE JR.  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ South Africa's Truth And Reconciliation Commission will
conclude Thursday that several leaders of the former government _
including President P.W. Botha _ issued orders or framed policies
that led to abductions, tortures, deaths in detention, bombings and
killings, according to sources familiar with the document.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's final report, the sources said, will also name
several key members of the former liberation movements as having
been responsible for excesses and abuses _ including deaths by
firing squad, inhuman conditions of incarceration, torture, and
beatings.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these men are now leading officials in the ruling
African National Congress government.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the five-volume, 3,500-page Truth Commission
report caps a turbulent 2 1/2-year investigation into the country's
blood-soaked past. It marks a watershed for post-apartheid South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, the final report calls on the African
National Congress to accept ``collective responsibility'' for human
rights abuses committed by its members during the struggle against
the former regime.
</P>
<P>
   Among the senior ANC members who, sources said, will be listed
in the ``findings and conclusions'' section of the final report are
the former ANC national commissar, Andrew Masondo, now a general in
the South African National Defense Force, and Joe Modise,
then-chief of the ANC's guerrilla wing and now the defense
minister.
</P>
<P>
   The report will also allege that bombings by the apartheid
government, in which scores were wounded but no one was killed, had
been planned by the former law and order minister, Adriaan Vlok,
and former police commissioner, Johan Van der Merwe.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, former President F.W. de Klerk, who shared the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 with the current president, Nelson
Mandela, will also be named as an ``accessory after the fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission concluded that de Klerk knew about the
involvement of Vlok and Van der Merwe, but never informed police.
</P>
<P>
   Most prominent on the list of people to whom the commission has
assigned blame is Botha, who is expected to be found responsible
for several incidents, including the Johannesburg bombings of
Khotso House in 1987 and Cosatu House in 1988. The first building
housed religious organizations; the second the country's largest
labor federation.
</P>
<P>
   Botha, who as president headed the secretive State Security
Council where key executive decisions were taken, will be among
several council members to be found responsible for the bombings,
according to the sources, who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The Truth Commission, led by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, is
empowered to grant amnesty to those found to have testified
truthfully about crimes carried out with a political motive, if
they confess and ask for the amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Neither de Klerk nor Botha has applied for the amnesty, and thus
both are liable for prosecution. De Klerk is expected to go to
court Tuesday in a last-ditch attempt to prevent the commission
from publishing its finding against him.
</P>
<P>
   The report is also expected to shed new light on so-called
``black-on-black'' violence between the ANC and followers of the
Inkatha Party of the Zulu chief, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, in which
about 10,000 people have been killed over the past 15 years, mostly
in the former Natal province.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been suspected, but not proven, that the former
white minority regime had helped orchestrate the violence through a
network of surrogate groups that came to be known as as the ``Third
Force.''
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, the report, citing State Security Council
memoranda, will allege that the Third Force was part of an official
government strategy called ``counter-mobilization.'' It will detail
how Pretoria supplied arms to Buthelezi and trained his fighters at
a base in Namibia called the Caprivi Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The former regime also stirred the pot in Western Cape Province,
where it supported older, more conservative migrant workers against
young people aligned with the ANC in battles to control townships,
the report will say.
</P>
<P>
   The report will also name former Defense Minister Magnus Malan
as an architect of the counter-mobilization strategy. In addition,
sources say the report will find Malan responsible for military
raids on suspected ANC targets in neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
   When Tutu presents the report to President Mandela Thursday in
Pretoria, it will mark a milestone for South Africa, eight years
after Mandela was released from prison and more than four years
after the country's first all-race elections.
</P>
<P>
   The commission consists of 17 promiment South Africans from
different walks of life, appointed by Mandela with a broad mandate
to determine what happened in the apartheid years, to promote
reconciliation in the country, to pay reparations to those found to
have suffered human rights violations, and to grant amnesty to
perpetrators of the violations where appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   These goals represented a bold effort in a deeply divided
society to come to terms with its ignominious past and to lay a
foundation for a more harmonious future.
</P>
<P>
   The deal for amnesty was central to the decision by former
President de Klerk, in negotiations with the ANC, to begin
relinquishing power to Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   De Klerk's National Party had been pushing for a blanket amnesty
to cover all of the excesses of the past, but finally agreed to the
current system, in which individuals are evaluated on a
case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's report, which has been delayed at least twice, will
not represent the end of the Truth Commission's work. That is
because the panel's Amnesty Committee, which makes its own
decisions on amnesty cases, and which operates independently from
the rest of the commission, has had to cope with more than 7,000
applications, far more than orginally expected. The committee is
not expected to finish its work until well into next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can criticize us for our slowness in coming to terms with
the amnesty process,'' said the commission spokesman, John Allen.
The size of the Amnesty Committee has grown from five to 19 to cope
with the extra work.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has also been criticized in some quarters for
releasing a report that will not answer the key quesions of who
will be granted amnesty for what crimes. But it decided that its
investigation had yielded a great deal _ enough to say what
happened under apartheid, and how special privileges were enshrined
for whites, and discrimination was institutionalized for the black
majority and other non-whites.
</P>
<P>
   In barnstorming the country, and eliciting often riveting
stories from more than 20,000 people found to have been victims of
human rights violations, the commission has become a fixture of
recent South African life and the subject of saturation media
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The panel has also been criticized from both ends of the
political spectrum. Whites have generally accused the panel of
conducting a witch hunt, complained of ``truth fatigue,'' and
ridiculed it as the ``Kleenex Commission'' for the tissues handed
out for tears shed at its hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Many blacks, for their part, complained that too many criminals
were getting off free under amnesty, and that the ANC was being
unjustly targeted for abuses carried out as part of a
``just-cause'' war of liberation.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, plagued from the outset by underfunding,
understaffing, and disorganization, has yet to deliver fully on its
mandate to pay reparations to victims. Symbolic stipends have been
granted, but the overall goal of paying each of the 22,000 victims
about $2,600 a year for six years has yet to be approved by the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the panel's overarching goal of promoting
reconciliation is in doubt: A recent national poll has found that
two-thirds of the respondents thought the commission had made race
relations worse, not better.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it has had some undeniable successes as well. The rest of
the world has scrutinized the group's work as a laboratory for
resolving racial conflict. Countries such as Chile, which have had
their own truth commissions, and Bosnia, which may in the future,
are also following the panel's progress.
</P>
<P>
   The South African commission has differed from other such panels
in its decisions to hold hearings in public, in naming perpetrators
of violent crimes, and in deciding not to grant blanket amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled mostly by the decisions of thousands of former police
officers, soldiers, and members of the security forces to come to
the confessional, the commission has also been able to shed
important light on the inner workings of apartheid while solving
hundreds of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   There have been searing images of families unearthing the bones
of their loved ones, in killing fields identified by the soldiers
of apartheid, or of smiling security officers posing over bodies,
at cookouts held to celebrate their kills.

   For Tutu, the commission's work was as much about process as
product, a ``transparent'' undertaking in which ordinary people who
had been victims of apartheid could gain a measure of catharsis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to give people the forum by which they could tell
their story, thereby achieving one of the aims of the act:
rehabilitation of their human and civil dignity,'' Tutu said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people had been invisible. I call them the small
people,'' added the archbishop and 1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner.
``We had to say, `The nation acknowledges that something happened
to you.' So under the full glare of the television lights, we let
them tell their story with very little interruption.''

   The Truth Commission will devote the entire second volume of its
final report to identifying perpetrators and detailing who did what
to whom. New information will also be presented on the inner
workings of government-supported structures like:
</P>
<P>
   _The State Security Council, which flowered in the 1980s under
Botha as a virtual shadow government directing and authorizing
operations against anti-apartheid forces both in and out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   _The Civil Cooperation Bureau, essentially a privatized section
of the South African Defense Force which operated under the
umbrella of the Special Forces.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _TREWITS, or the Counter Revolutionary Intelligence Task Team,
made up of security police, Special Forces, Military Intelligence
and the National Intelligence Service.
</P>
<P>
   _Koevoet, the paramilitary police structure run by the South
African Defense Force in Namibia in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   _Vlakplaas, the farm on the outskirts of Pretoria from which a
state-sponsored death squad operated under the command of Eugene de
Kock. De Kock has emerged as the chief namer of names in the
apartheid era, and has a 4,000-page amnesty application pending
before the Truth Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said a section of Volume 2 will also attempt to assign
responsibility for the cross-border raids that the apartheid regime
made against neighboring countries like Angola, Mozambique,
Lesotho, Swaziland, Botswana, and Zambia in an effort to punish the
states for harboring and assisting antiapartheid forces.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the political spectrum, the prominent among
the commission's findings against the ANC are abuses it is said to
have committed at a former detention facility in Angola known as
Quatro, or Camp Four. Several cases of abuses ranging from
beatings, brutal interrogation, torture, and killing were
investigated by the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said the report will say the ANC must also bear
responsibility for the actions of Mandela's former wife, Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela, in connection with the 1991 death of a young
Soweto activist. Madikizela-Mandela was convicted of kidnap and
assault in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Besides focusing on both extremes of the conflict, the final
report will also assess the role played by white noncombatants _
the so-called ``benficiaries'' of apartheid, such as business
executives, lawyers, jurists, doctors, the clergy, and journalists.
The report will find that all sectors played supportive, if
compliant, roles in the flowering of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the major success of the Truth Commission is that it
has placed information in the public domain from which people can
gain knowledge about the past,'' said Charles Villa-Vicencio, the
commission's research director who presided over the writing of the
final report. ``But there needs to be a distinction between
knowledge and acknowledgement. The nation has been brought to
acknowledgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu added: ``For many years the public was fed a whole tissue
of lies. Most of us had a hunch of what had happened, but we didn't
have the precise details. Now these details are going to come
forward. ... We must face up to the horrors of the past or we will
not be serving our country.''

WILLIAMS, NOW FREE AGENT, PUTS ONE FOOT OUT THE DOOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After years of contentious contract negotiations, Bernie
Williams took a possible first step away from the Yankees Monday,
becoming a free agent for the first time. Though anything could
happen, the prevailing feeling in baseball circles is that Williams
will sign elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the American League batting champion and a Gold Glove
outfielder, was one of 28 players who filed for free agency,
raising the number of free agents to 80.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Williams Monday were Kevin Brown and Steve Finley of San
Diego, Roberto Alomar of Baltimore, Gregg Jefferies of Anaheim, Tim
Raines of the Yankees and Carlos Baerga and Armando Reynoso of the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have reached this juncture with the home-grown
Williams by not trying to sign him to a multiyear contract earlier
in his career. They offered him a five-year contract for $37.5
million last winter, but his agent, Scott Boras, told the Yankees
he was looking for a seven-year deal that would put Williams in the
economic class of Albert Belle and Sammy Sosa, meaning $10 million
to $11 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, returned to his
office Monday after a brief respite to celebrate the World Series
championship, and one of his first pieces of business was a
telephone call to Boras.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just letting Scott know that Bernie is our No. 1
priority,'' Cashman said about the 15-minute conversation. ``I
reminded him I honored my obligation by not approaching Bernie
about his contract all season. I told him we are very interested in
keeping Bernie, and hopefully at some time when we make an offer,
he'll find it reasonable and acceptable and we can continue our
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman said the Yankees must have discussions internally before
he can make an offer to the 30-year-old Williams, but ``the intent
is to do something fairly quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman was said to have told a baseball agent during the World
Series that he didn't expect Williams to sign with the Yankees, but
Cashman declined to comment on what he might have said.
</P>
<P>
   The general manager said Boras made no response to his remarks
about Williams. Cashman also said he did not talk with Boras about
Brown, another of his clients. Brown and Randy Johnson will be the
two most attractive and expensive pitchers available as free agents
this off season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for me to start the ball rolling in house,''
Cashman said, ``before I have a conversation with anyone outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman said he has spoken in recent days with the Yankees'
other potential free agents or their agents except for Raines. The
Yankees are not expected to re-sign Raines.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone has until midnight Wednesday to exercise the $5.5
million option in his contract. If he rejects it, he can become a
free agent and try to negotiate another contract with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Among clubs expected to have interest in at least talking with
Williams are Detroit, Texas, Arizona and Baltimore. Doug Melvin,
the Rangers' general manager, found it amusing that one report had
designated the Rangers as the front-runner in the Williams race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all speculation because Juan and Pudge are from Puerto
Rico and I signed him originally,'' Melvin said by telephone from
Arlington, Tex., referring to the Rangers' top stars, Juan Gonzalez
and Ivan Rodriguez, and the fact that they come from the same
country as Williams. ``We have to look at pitching first. I don't
rule out signing a position player, but we're still going to focus
on pitching first. If we can add pitching, we'll decide after that
if we can pursue someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The pact Boras seeks for Williams will most likely be affected
by the seven-year, $91 million contract the Mets gave Mike Piazza.
The agent will likely try to make Brown the highest-paid pitcher,
seeking more than the $12.5 million a year Pedro Martinez averages
with Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two players who filed for free agency Monday, the Mets
have indicated that they will let Baerga go but have been
noncommittal about Reynoso. They are deep in starting pitching, but
Reynoso was one of the reasons they were deep this year.
</P>
<P>
   Among other players who filed were B.J. Surhoff and Jimmy Key of
Baltimore, Tim Belcher of Kansas City, Paul Molitor of Minnesota,
Rickey Henderson of Oakland, John Jaha of Milwaukee and Pat Kelly
of St. Louis. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A two-year contract extension for Yankee Manager Joe Torre
appears to be imminent. The Yankees, who will pay Torre about $1.3
million next season, are prepared to give him a salary in the $2
million neighborhood for each of the two seasons after that. &QL;

INSURER MUST PAY $100.5 MILLION IN REDLINING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Ohio)  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a milestone decision, a jury in Richmond, Va., ordered
Nationwide Insurance Co. on Monday to pay $100.5 million in damages
to a local housing group that accused the insurer of refusing to
sell homeowner policies to black residents.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first of many complaints brought by housing groups
against the insurer to go to trial, and the award of $100 million
in punitive damages along with $500,000 in compensatory damages was
nearly seven times as great as any payments agreed to in cases that
were settled before trial.
</P>
<P>
   Although the verdict was rendered in a state court, it could
influence insurance sales around the United States. ``Today's
verdict is good news not just for minorities,'' said Andrew Cuomo,
the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development,
which provided $1.5 million for research on discrimination, which
led to the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, one of the nation's largest providers of homeowners'
insurance, said it would appeal the verdict to the Virginia Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, Nationwide turned down an offer to settle the
case for $20 million, according to Constance Chamberlin, the
executive director of the Richmond group that brought the suit,
Housing Opportunities Made Equal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They countered with $265,000 including lawyers' fees,'' Ms.
Chamberlin said. ``We then offered to take $17.5 million and they
never responded.''
</P>
<P>
   John Millen, a spokesman for Nationwide, confirmed that a
settlement had been discussed, but would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   During the two-week trial, Judge Randall Johnson of the Richmond
Circuit Court urged the two sides several times to settle, Ms.
Chamberlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chamberlin's group spent a week before a jury of six blacks
and one white woman explaining how it had telephoned Nationwide
agents in Richmond, which is 55 percent black, with requests for
coverage for a house they said was about to be bought, saying
alternatively that it was in a white neighborhood and then in a
black one.
</P>
<P>
   Getting coverage, Ms. Chamberlin said, ``was a problem in the
case of the black areas but never in the white ones.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't refuse all the time to write policies in
Afro-American neighborhoods,'' she said, ``but they tried to avoid
doing business in those neighborhoods. And if you succeeded in
getting a Nationwide policy, you would pay more than your white
counterparts and you would be very likely to get an inferior
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Millen said the group was inconsistent in its calls to agents
and this led to ``a preconceived conclusion that the company was
discriminating.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Ms. Chamberlin's group ``swayed the jury with a highly
emotionally charged argument which we believe had no place in a
court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chamberlin said her group had been faced ``with a major case
of institutional racism.'' She added, ``You've got to talk about
what you see.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially our attorneys pointed out all of Nationwide's
policies and practices and the impact they had on African-American
neighborhoods,'' she said. ``We showed that Nationwide relied upon
race, in its own documents, as a basis for choosing where to do
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Quoting from a Nationwide document, the group's lawyers told the
jury that agents had been instructed to avoid ``black urbanite
households with many children,'' Ms. Chamberlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Mayewski, a senior analyst at A.M. Best &AMP; Co., the
insurance rating agency, said the $100.5 million verdict would not
have much financial impact on a company with property casualty
assets of $25 billion and revenue of $8.5 billion last year, mainly
from homeowner and auto insurance policies. But the damage to
reputation, he said, could ``go beyond the purely hard-dollar
costs.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Industry specialists said the largest previous payment for
charges of racial discrimination in homeowners' coverage was a
settlement of $14.5 million made by American Family Mutual
Insurance Co. in Milwaukee three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Nationwide settled a suit for $5.3 million in Toledo,
Ohio, that was based on charges similar to those in Richmond.
Millen said the company decided not to settle with the Richmond
group, because ``we felt there was very little evidence supporting
their claims.''

 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
AUSTIN _ Confidence may not make tackles or score touchdowns, but
it plays a significant role in every college football game.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Texas Longhorns sound like they need an extra airplane seat
and maybe even a jersey for their pal ``confidence'' when they take
to the road to face No. 7 Nebraska on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being tabbed more than two-touchdown underdogs and
suffering disappointment in two similar situations this season, the
Longhorns believe they can pull off an upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident that we can play with them, and confidence is
a big thing to have going into any game,'' UT linebacker Anthony
Hicks said. ``The way that we've gone out and played defensively
has been a great confidence-booster. Any great team has a lot of
team confidence, to go out there and play the type of game that
they know they can play. That's what we have right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It must be contagious. The entire team seems to be infected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of confidence breathing throughout the team,''
said tight end Derek Lewis, who mentioned a 34-3 win over Oklahoma
as helping turn Texas around. ``We're gonna fight until we can't
fight anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Fight would not be used to describe the Longhorns' effort in the
first half of their games on the road against top-10 teams UCLA and
Kansas State. Apparently, their intangible teammate did not make
those trips. In each game, Texas took a throw-in-the-towel-type
deficit into the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   A spirited second-half push did close UCLA's 35-3 halftime lead
to a more respectable 49-31 loss, but Kansas State's 35-0 advantage
at the break led to a 48-7 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers, winners of 47 consecutive games at home, will
be intent on extending a similar early welcome to the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played in hostile places this year,'' Lewis said. ``We
went to UCLA _ some people want to forget _ and we learned some
valuable lessons. We went to Manhattan and learned some more
lessons. That's two great places to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Manhattan, with 45,000, it was hard to believe that those
people could make that much noise. It was like they had extra
voices and multiple personalities. It was really loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has played a large role in silencing Nebraska fans before.
He was the recipient of the historic fourth-down James Brown pass
that helped Texas clinch the inaugural Big 12 Championship Game
over the Cornhuskers in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Lewis leads the Longhorns with four touchdown catches
and is tied for third on the team with 15 receptions overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty sure the fans are going to give me a warm
reception,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' receptions, as well as those from Texas' top receivers
Wane McGarity (32 catches, 678 yards) and Kwame Cavil (31, 510),
could prove to be important against the Cornhuskers, who allow just
106.5 rushing yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Nebraska hasn't faced Ricky Williams, the nation's
leading rusher (1,484 yards) and scorer (24 TDs). Kansas State has
been the only team that has shut down Williams so far, limiting him
to 43 yards on 25 carries. But that was before confidence spread
among the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has since reeled off four consecutive wins, and Williams
is erasing records from the books with almost every carry. He holds
nine NCAA records and 41 school marks after breaking the Division
I-A scoring record with a pair of touchdowns in the Longhorns'
30-20 win over Baylor on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is averaging 20.6 points a game, more than 34 Division
I-A teams. Every team gears its defense to stop him, yet only
Kansas State succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Can Nebraska?
</P>
<P>
   ``(The offensive line is) playing with confidence, and they know
that they can block any defensive line in the country, so that's
really good for us,'' Williams said. ``I think now we know what it
takes, and we'll be better prepared. Early in the season, we
weren't playing with that much confidence, and we weren't sure that
we could beat Kansas State and UCLA. Now, we know we have at least
a shot to play with Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the Longhorns is that Nebraska has looked
vulnerable on several occasions this season. The bad news? Well,
Nebraska has looked vulnerable on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Winners of three national titles in the past four years, the
Cornhuskers carry an air of invincibility that is hard to shake.
When they are not as dominant as expected, it is viewed as an
aberration.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers have a dominant win over then-ninth-ranked
Washington, but close wins over Oklahoma State and Missouri
sandwich a loss on the road at Texas A&AMP;M and a blowout of Kansas.
They look like a team that can be had _ on paper, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still Nebraska,'' Williams responded. ``That's all
that has to be said.''

MICROSOFT SAYS PROBLEMS WERE NETSCAPE'S OWN FAULT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Monday wrapped up its cross-examination
of Netscape chief executive James Barksdale by suggesting Netscape
has only itself to blame for its declining revenues, and that the
company sought to shift blame to Microsoft through entrapment.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's lawyer, who last week accused Netscape of having
``invented or imagined'' the subjects discussed at a key 1995
meeting, Monday went even further, accusing Netscape of setting up
the meeting as a sting to generate evidence for the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wasn't it a fact, Mr. Barksdale, that the June 21 (1995)
meeting was held for the purpose of creating something that could
be called a record and delivered to the Department of Justice to
spur them on to action against Microsoft?'' asked Microsoft's
lawyer, John Warden. It was at that meeting that Netscape alleges
Microsoft proposed to illegally divide the market for Internet
browsers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's absurd,'' Barksdale said.
</P>
<P>
   Warden cited as evidence for his allegation the fact that within
24 hours of the 1995 meeting, Netscape's notes on the meeting were
subpoenaed by the government, and a day later, a Netscape lawyer
sent the government a letter detailing Microsoft's alleged illegal
conduct. Outside the courthouse, another Netscape lawyer dismissed
the notion of a sting as a conspiracy theory promulgated by
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange came on the fourth and final day of Microsoft's
cross-examination of Barksdale, the government's first witness in
its antitrust suit against Microsoft. The federal government and 20
states and the District of Columbia are accusing Microsoft of
illegal anti-competitive actions.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale Tuesday will for the first time be questioned by a
government lawyer, and is expected to flesh out his complaints
against Microsoft. Barksdale is to be followed to the stand by
America Online senior vice president David Colburn.
</P>
<P>
   During a speech Monday to the National Press Club, America
Online President Steve Case previewed Colburn's testimony.
Bolstering a government allegation in the trial, Case said the
reason America Online chose Microsoft over Netscape to manufacture
America Online's browser is that Microsoft was able to offer
America Online coveted display space on the Windows desktop, seen
by 90 percent of personal computer users.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought ... they (Microsoft and Netscape) were reasonably
comparable technical solutions ... so certainly the factor that
tilted it in favor of Microsoft was their willingness to bundle our
software with their operating system,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   Also this week, the government hopes to show some of the 20
hours of videotape taking during the three-day questioning of
Microsoft chief Bill Gates. Gates has not been called as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   During Monday's questioning of Barksdale, Warden repeatedly
suggested that Netscape had lost lucrative deals with America
Online and Intuit because of a variety of missteps. He suggested
that Netscape was too slow to adapt to its potential corporate
customers' needs and manufactured an inferior product that had
inelegant code and ran too slowly. He offered as evidence a gripe
posted by Netscape employee Darin May on a company electronic
bulletin board in which May described his own company's browser as
``faster than a dog with no legs if the dog's up to its waist in
treacle and dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's hearing brought one of the more bizarre revelations of
the trial thus far _ Barksdale and Case, two extremely wealthy
corporate chieftains, referred to each other in e-mail as Franklin
D. (as in Roosevelt, the former U.S. president) and Joseph Stalin
(played by Barksdale, who complained that he wanted to be Winston
Churchill instead). Apparently the language was used to connote the
allied nations of World War II. Microsoft's lawyer suggested that
by implication that meant Barksdale and Case viewed Microsoft as
the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other points Warden made Monday:
</P>
<P>
   _Six months before the meeting at which Barksdale claims his
company's warfare with Microsoft broke out, Netscape had known that
Microsoft was planning to integrate its own browser into its
operating system. In a memo to potential investors in January 1995,
Netscape warned that ``Microsoft ... has announced its intentions
to add functionality to the browser software and to bundle it with
its Windows 95 operating systems.'' Microsoft says that memorandum
undermines the notion that Microsoft bundled its browser into its
operating system to punish Netscape after the June meeting.
</P>
<P>
   _Although Microsoft makes the main browser used by America
Online members, those members can switch to a Netscape browser by
typing in the keyword ``Netscape.''

   MICROSOFT-JUSTICE (Washington) _ _ Microsoft wraps up its
cross-examination of Netscape chief executive James Barksdale by

CSUN, WEBER ST. IN GAME OF SURVIVAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Psyches are damaged and once-promising seasons are
on the verge of collapse. It's the state of Cal State Northridge.
It's the state of Weber State.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN has lost two straight. No.23 Weber State, which peaked at
No.9 this season, has lost three in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The unforeseen, and unexpected, courses of the two schools have
changed the importance of Saturday's game in Ogden, Utah. Instead
of jockeying for position in the Big Sky Conference, they are
playing for survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the kids (Sunday), `How you're feeling right now is how
Weber State is feeling,' '' CSUN coach Ron Ponciano said. ``The
question is whether we can recover better than they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago Weber State and CSUN were unbeaten in Big Sky
playand rumblings of a showdown surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Wildcats (5-3, 3-2 Big Sky) lost to Montana State,
Boise State and Portland State.The Matadors (4-3, 3-2) did their
part with a startling loss to Sacramento State and another
turnover-filled setback to Montana State.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does another loss ruin hopes of a conference title for
either CSUN or Weber State, it would also squash faint playoff
hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lose three games in a row and had a chance to win the
games, so it wears on you quite a bit,'' Weber State coach Jerry
Graybeal said. ``I think all the teams in the league with two
losses feel there's a sense of urgency. I think there's going to be
some sorting out this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Outta sight: It brought national attention for three weeks, but,
as expected, CSUN dropped out of both major polls Monday. And the
Matadors fell hard.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sports Network poll, CSUN dropped from No.24 to the
also-receiving-votes category, where it checked in at 35th. In the
USA Today coaches' poll, the Matadors dropped from 25th to 34th.
</P>
<P>
   It ended a three-week stay in the national rankings for CSUN,
which topped out at 16th in both polls after an Oct. 10 win against
Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Weber State fell six spots to No. 23 in the Sports Network poll
and eight places to 25th by the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Expected back: Ponciano lauded the efforts of Ryan Schatz at
left tackle against Montana State, but said he will move the senior
back to tight end this week because Mike Barnes is expected back
from a shoulder injury. Also, center Beau Cherry (ankle) should
return to add depth to the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   There was good news for CSUN's second-leading receiver Mike
Ogas. X-rays showed no break to his left index finger, and he
should be available for Weber State. However, senior Kenny Knoop
saw his season end. An MRI on Monday showed a torn anterior
cruciate ligament in his right knee and surgery is required.
</P>
<P>
   Short yardage: CSUN kicker Manny Marquez kicked field goals of
23, 30, 31 and 45 yards against Montana State but wasn't the Big
Sky special teams player of the week. Instead, that honor when to
Idaho State's Pete Garces, who had five PATs and made field goals
of 41, 37 and 51 yards in a win against Southern Utah.... Weber
State strong safety Scott Shields tied the conference record for
career interceptions with his 22nd on Saturday. He has five this
season.

   &UR; King Philip II Exhibitions &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My daughter and I will be in Spain in December. Are there any
exhibitions related to the 400th anniversary of King Philip II's
death? I understand we missed the one at El Escorial. _ Simon
Stoller, Miami
</P>
<P>
   A. You're right about the Escorial exhibition, which was shown
at King Philip's palace and monastery near Madrid. But almost
immediately after it closed on Oct. 10, the Spanish government
opened two major art shows to continue its commemoration of the
death of King Philip, who lost what was thought to be the
invincible Armada against England in 1588.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Prince of the Renaissance,'' which runs until Jan. 10 at the
Prado in Madrid, focuses on the art patronage of Philip, who ruled
the world's most powerful empire of the day. His taste for
collecting paintings by Titian and Hieronymous Bosch is generally
less well known than his brutal repression of opponents around the
globe. The show presents 390 works, including paintings, drawings,
jewelry and letters. It is open Tuesday to Saturday from 9 a.m. to
7 p.m., Sunday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., closed Monday. Admission for
a reserved day and time is $7.85; $4 for those willing to stand on
line. Telephone in Spain 902-22-99-99 or from abroad (34)
91-330-2800.
</P>
<P>
   The other show, ``The King's Land and Men'' runs until Jan. 10
at the Villena Palace in Valladolid, Philip's native city, 120
miles northwest of Madrid. The exhibition assembles 345 works,
mainly paintings and drawings, to highlight the crucial people in
Philip's court and the territories he ruled. It is open Tuesday to
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. to 6 p.m., Sunday from
10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and closed Monday. Admission is $4. Telephone:
(34) 983-254-083.

<P>
   &UR; 60-Plus and Mexico-Bound &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I, both in our 60s, would like to sign up with
a tour group for a trip to Mexico. We are looking for programs that
are educational and that are geared to our age group. Can you help?
_ Martha Benet, Rockville Centre, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. At least two tour organizations that specialize in travel for
people over 50 _ the University of New Hampshire's Interhostel
program and Saga Holidays, which is based in Boston _ are offering
Mexico trips that emphasize history and Mexican culture.
</P>
<P>
   Historic Legacies of Mexico, a Saga Holidays' Road Scholar
itinerary, is a 10-day tour that has five departure dates scheduled
next year: Jan. 5, Feb. 9, March 9, Oct. 19 and Nov. 30.
Participants visit Oaxaca and Cuernavaca, both in the southeastern
section of Mexico. While in Oaxaca, you'll stay in the Camino Real,
a 16th-century former convent; hear lectures about folk art and
colonial and Indian history at the Instituto Cultural Oaxaca; visit
nearby Zapotec and Mixtec archeological sites, as well as villages
where you'll view pottery and weaving techniques; and tour the
markets, churches and museums of the city of Oaxaca. In Cuernacava,
accommodations are in the Mision del Sol, an adobe resort and spa
just outside the city. From there you will visit Aztec temples, the
Indian village of Tepoztlan and the archeological site of
Teotihuacan. In Cuernavaca, participants will tour a Franciscan
cathedral, a colonial history museum and Jardin Borda, a garden and
mansion once used by Emperor Maximilian. Prices, including air fare
from New York, range from $1,549 to $1,849, double occupancy,
depending on departure date. A two-day extension to Mexico City is
available for $199, double occupancy. Information: (800) 621-2151.
</P>
<P>
   Among the stops and activities on Interhostel's Colonial Mexico
tour are the ancient Toltec city of Tula; the Eduardo Ruiz National
Park, the winter resting place for monarch butterflies high in the
Sierra Madre; the colonial town of Morelia; Lake Patzcuaro; and the
cities of Guanajuato and San Miguel de Allende. Accommodations,
with private baths, are in hotels that are, for the most part,
housed in colonial buildings. The 14-day tour, which departs March
1, costs $2,655, double occupancy, from Houston. Interhostel also
has a two-week Christmas tour departing Dec. 19 that goes to
Cuernavaca and Mexico City. The focus is on traditional
celebrations, folkloric dance, markets and crafts. Participants
will also attend a Ballet Folklorico performance in Mexico City and
attend a posada (a traditional Christmas party). The cost, from
Houston is $2,645. Information: (800) 733-9753, or (603) 862-1147;
fax (603) 862-1113.

   &UR; New Museum Card for Rome &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you help with information on a card that allows entry
into a dozen or so of Rome's museums? I'm told its relatively new.
_ Cynthia P. Heath, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. The Socius Urbis Week-Itinere Card, which was introduced in
early October, is probably what you're referring to. It costs
$16.50 and entitles the bearer to visit 13 municipal museums and
archeological areas associated with the Roma Caput Mundi
association, which uses part of the profits from sales of the card
toward one of its 48 restoration projects. The card is valid for a
week from the date it is first used, and it comes with a book of
ticket vouchers or coupons that can be used to get into selected
museums and archeological areas.
</P>
<P>
   The choices include such popular sites as the Capitoline
museums, Augustus' Altar of Peace and Trajan's forum and markets.
Other monuments, less known but no less interesting, include the
Barracco Museum of Ancient Sculpture; Maecenas' Auditorium; the
Circus of Maxentius and the Mausoleum of Romulus on the Appian Way;
the Municipal Gallery of Modern and Contemporary Art; the Museum of
Roman Civilization; the Museum of the walls of Rome at St.
Sebastian Door; the Napoleonic Museum; the synagogue's collection;
and the Canonica Museum and the Zoo, both in the vast Villa
Borghese Park. (There are also vouchers for the Museum of Rome in
the Braschi Palace, the Antiquarium of the Caelian Hill, the Museum
of Folklore and Roman Poets and the tomb of the Scipio family, but
all four sites are currently being restored. No dates have been
given for their reopening.)
</P>
<P>
   The coupon booklet includes a description of each museum and
archeological area and gives the opening hours and addresses. For
individuals, the card is only available at the offices of a tour
organization called Itinere, at 66 Via Francesco Denza in the
Parioli district. Information: (39-06) 80690198. The office is open
from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 2 to 6 p.m.

BOEING PARTNERSHIP PLANS MAJOR PILOT TRAINING FACILITY IN MIAMI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ FlightSafety Boeing, a business venture between The
Boeing Co. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc., announced Monday that it
plans to open a $100 million Latin America training hub in Miami
for pilots and ground crews.
</P>
<P>
   The successful joint venture, which was only formed early last
year, already has a North American training hub in Seattle and
recently announced plans to build a European training center in
London.
</P>
<P>
   Future growth plans also include a hub in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
   The one at Miami International Airport will be the world's
largest non-airline-owned flight training facility, Boeing said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that Miami will, over the next decade, emerge as
the single center in the world, with more flight and maintenance
training activity for airplanes than any other,'' Wake Smith,
president of FlightSafety Boeing International, said at a
teleconference with Miami business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We perceive Miami to be the capital of this industry going
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said it expects to eventually train about 7,000 pilots
and 3,000 maintenance technicians each year at the Miami center
after it opens in the first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the hub is expected to include 18 full-flight
simulators used for pilot training, four-story high ``bays'' to
house the simulators, a computer-based training lab with about 30
workstations, full maintenance-technician training capability,
fourteen classrooms and two laboratories to support training on a
variety of commercial airplanes of 100 seats or more.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the 115,000-square-foot hub is expected to include 18
full-flight simulators used for pilot training, four-story high
``bays'' to house the simulators, a computer-based training lab
with about 30 workstations, full maintenance-technician training
capability, fourteen classrooms and two laboratories to support
training on a variety of commercial airplanes of 100 seats or more.
</P>
<P>
   FlightSafety Boeing was created to be the biggest player in this
industry and we are that today,'' Smith added. ``But we have
aggressive plans to continue to construct a global training
delivery system which will enable airlines of the world to get
professional training close to their locations.''
</P>
<P>
   The venture so far has 15 training facilities worldwide,
including its North American hub in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In March of last year, FlightSafety Boeing International became
the first major acquisition of Boeing Enterprises, which had been
formed a month earlier to look for new aviation-related investments
for Boeing. The Seattle-based aerospace giant invested $200 million
for a 50 percent stake in the venture with FlightSafety
International to train pilots and ground crews. It is now one one
of the largest such traing programs in the world and employs about
500 people.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's partner in the Miami venture, FlightSafety
International, was recently acquired by investor Warren Buffett's
Berkshire Hathaway company.

LOS ANGELES COUNTY HOME MARKET COOLS IN AUTUMN
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attention editors: Corrects slug.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mirroring a national trend, home sales slowed in
September from the August pace in Los Angeles County, but remained
well ahead of 1997 levels, an industry association has reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The number of previously owned homes sold in the county last
month fell 2 percent from August, and the median price dropped by 4
percent to $193,020, according to the California Association of
Realtors and Transamerica Intellitech, a real estate tracking firm.
</P>
<P>
   But there were still 6.5 percent more sales last month than in
September 1997, and the median price was 10.8 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a strong market, but slowing,'' said Leslie
Appleton-Young, chief economist for the Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials say growing concern about the nation's
economy is taking a toll on potential buyers. The Conference Board,
a New York-based private research group, said earlier this month
that consumer confidence in the economy fell in September for the
third consecutive month.
</P>
<P>
   Also depressing local sales is the shrinking variety of choices
available to buyers as the home supply dwindles. ``This market's
been going full speed ahead for two years, so inventory is low,''
Appleton-Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Even in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley area, which has a relatively
greater abundance of available homes, the shortage is being felt,
said Bud Mauro, president of the Southland Regional Association of
Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The low inventory is restricting our ability to fill the slots
for all these buyers,'' Mauro said. ``We don't have enough
inventory to show customers a good variety.''
</P>
<P>
   The California Association of Realtors maintains an index of
unsold inventory that roughly measures how long it would take to
sell all single-family homes available in a given market. A year
ago, the index stood at 6.1 months. In September, it was 5.4
months. ``And we really consider 10 to 12 months to be a balanced
market,'' Appleton-Young said.
</P>
<P>
   A local exception to the September decline is Ventura County,
where sales rose 5.5 percent from August and 5.6 percent from
September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, home sales also were down in September, though at 0.9
percent the decline was less dramatic than in Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in Los Angeles County, however, was less than the
7.7 percent drop in Santa Clara County, paced by its Silicon
Valley, and the San Francisco Bay Area's 4.3 percent fall. Year to
year, California home sales are up 9.3 percent, and the median
price of $204,630 is 6.8 percent ahead of the September 1997 level.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Realtors also released figures
Monday indicating sales of single-family homes fell in September
for the second consecutive month. Sales activity dropped 1.1
percent from August, but was ahead of September 1997 by 8.8
percent. &QL;

 TRAVEL PLANS FOR HAMED ARE GROUNDED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The already troubled show between Prince Naseem Hamed and Wayne
McCullough hit another bump Monday. Hamed remained in Sheffield,
England, while his U.S.-based promoter, Cedric Kushner, scrambled
to get him a last-minute visa so that the featherweight sensation
could box in Atlantic City, N.J., on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner said that a visa for Hamed had been secured as of Monday
night and that Hamed was supposed to pick it up at the U.S.
Consulate in London and then board the Concorde for New York
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Hamed was in New York a few weeks ago to promote his
latest bout, but he did not seek a visa at that time. Kushner said
he did not know why no visa application was made at that time.
Kushner has been the promoter for the bout for only five days. The
visa snarl is just the latest blow to a show that has been on the
ropes for the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A British court has frozen the assets of Frank Warren, Hamed's
London-based promoter. Warren is battling tax-evasion charges.
Under those circumstances, Kushner was brought on board last
Thursday after all the other parties agreed that he should take
over the promoter responsibilities from Warren.
</P>
<P>
   All the revenue from the HBO television fees and the site fee
paid by Bally's Park Place Casino to pay the fighters and handle
the other expenses related to the fight will flow through Kushner's
business accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is somewhat unusual,'' Kushner said of taking over a boxing
promotion so late in the process. ``I had no idea when I agreed to
this that there might be these types of complications. I've been a
boxing promoter for 13 years and a rock-concert promoter for eight
years before that. There have always been problems. To date, I've
always been able to handle them.''
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation that Hamed was not going to leave England
until he had assurances that his $2 million purse was secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have explained to Hamed's management to their satisfaction
that all the necessary details can be worked out and will be worked
out prior to the fight taking place,'' Kushner said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCullough, who lives in Las Vegas, had not arrived
in Atlantic City on Monday, either. McCullough, who is scheduled to
earn $500,000, was supposed to arrive there at midnight.

METS' BRASS IS TALKING OF DEALING FOR BONILLA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Piazza has signed. Al Leiter has all but signed.
And now the Mets' next move may be bringing back someone they once
made the highest-paid player in the game when they signed him as a
free agent almost seven years ago: Bobby Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Steve Phillips would not comment Monday on talk
that the Mets would send Mel Rojas to the Los Angeles Dodgers for
Bonilla, who played in parts of four stormy seasons for the Mets
from 1992 to 1995. But the way the Mets' co-owner Fred Wilpon
sounded Monday, he would not mind having Bonilla back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting tampering aside, if the Dodgers wanted to talk to
Steve about a trade, Nelson and I would be very receptive,'' Wilpon
said, referring to the Mets' other co-owner, Nelson Doubleday.
``Bobby has changed. His attitude toward New York has changed. And
on the plus side, he's basically a metropolitan New York guy. I
think he wants to finish what he started here. Coming in where he
is not `The Guy,' that's the most important thing. He's got a
supporting cast now.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaning Piazza, of course. Should the Mets reobtain the
switch-hitting Bonilla, who turns 36 in February, he would most
likely become their everyday left fielder and bat behind Piazza.
The Mets tried to do the same thing with the switch-hitting Todd
Hundley, but the experiment failed after 34 games. Now, with
Piazza's signing, Hundley's career with the Mets appears to be
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the calls I had today have been from general managers
in relation to what are we going to do with Todd,'' Phillips said.
``But we've also had a couple calls from agents. They see money
being spent.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be more to follow, Wilpon and Doubleday said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve has the permission and the obligation to go out and put
as many pieces together as he can, short of going out on the subway
tracks and throwing money at trains,'' Doubleday said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The first move was re-signing Piazza. Doubleday was asked if he
ever thought it possible that Piazza would come back when he was
being booed over the summer at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think that far ahead,'' Doubleday said. ``I was just
thinking, `Mike, please do something to shut our boo-birds up.' But
I think at the end of the year, he had won them over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in the entertainment business. And we're selling
entertainment here. I felt that if we got a man of Piazza's stature
and ability, the fans would come back. And they did. So we kind of
owed them one.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Wilpon: ``Theoretically, there are a couple of positions
that we can enhance. We need to get some power from one of the
outfield corners. We need to get some speed on this team. We need
some more pitching, maybe both starting and relief. And we
certainly need either a second baseman or a third baseman,''
depending on where Edgardo Alfonzo plays.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that Carlos Baerga is all but out as a Met. And that
any one of the Mets' starters other than Leiter or Rick Reed may be
deemed expendable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, four years ago, we weren't ready then,''
Wilpon said of his team's rebuilding years. ``We didn't want to
play Rotisserie baseball like we did in the early '90s. And the
chemistry wasn't good. I think we're ready now to do what we have
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is one reason Bonilla may be back. Another is that
Bonilla may be more available because Davey Johnson has been hired
for three years as the Dodger manager; those two have clashed in
the past, most recently in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets and Dodgers conclude a deal, the Mets will probably
pick up the $4.5 million remaining on Rojas' salary, while the
Dodgers will pay Bonilla's $5.9 million next season and then a
sizable portion of the same amount in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a business plan in place that takes into account
revenues, expenses and payroll,'' Phillips said. ``It will be
higher than last year. It puts us in the range to become a playoff-
and World Series-caliber team. Our rank will be higher than last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   But that rank will almost certainly not include Hundley's
salary, not with Piazza signed for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of saddened,'' said Wilpon, who has an extremely
close relationship with Hundley. ``I had hoped we'd be able to fit
both. It was a long shot. But I had hoped Todd would be able to
play another position and that he'd be able to stay here. I have
very strong feelings about Todd and toward Todd. Hopefully, he will
go to a place where he will really thrive. But it will probably be
in a league that starts with an A.''

NEW YORK'S TO-DO LIST: FIX TEAM, START ANOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Another season, another $20 million loss for Major
League Soccer. The average attendance dropped by 304 from last
season's 14,616, and the television ratings were less than 1 point
in 12 ABC telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The league did have some bright spots _ including the success of
the Chicago Fire, the expansion team that won the championship on
Sunday. But hurting the progress of MLS is the MetroStars, the New
York-New Jersey franchise that has become a lackluster anchor for
the league.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars have failed to get beyond the first round of the
playoffs in three years, and their attendance has declined by 30
percent since the first year. On top of all that, the franchise has
endured repeated changes in coaches and players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a day goes by without thinking how much more successful
the league would be with the MetroStars doing better,'' said Hank
Steinbrecher, the secretary general of the United States Soccer
Federation. ``Everybody in the country is rooting for them to do
better because they know what it means to the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Doug Logan said: ``A lot of how this league is
perceived is how the MetroStars are perceived. The opportunity in
New York is huge, and it hasn't been explored. The political
connections in northern New Jersey are good, but not enough to
sustain the team at the level we want to.''
</P>
<P>
   League officials have been so disappointed at the MetroStars'
efforts that some have tried to persuade John Kluge and Stuart
Subotnick of Metromedia, the team's investor operators, to
restructure the team's front office, especially its marketing.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the MetroStars' troubles, MLS and Metromedia are
planning to add another franchise in the metropolitan area as early
as 2000, one that might play at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But the league's more immediate concern is the MetroStars.
Subotnick, who is more involved than Kluge in the operation of the
team, says he has every intention of keeping Charlie Stillitano in
charge of all soccer matters like coaches and players.
</P>
<P>
   Stillitano has been the team's vice president and general
manager since its first day, and Subotnick recently offered him a
five-year contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Stillitano will soon announce the signing of Bora Milutinovic,
who last month became the team's fifth coach, to continue on the
job for the next two years. And Stillitano is also looking at ways
to improve the caliber of players.
</P>
<P>
   Logan said the management committee is encouraging the
MetroStars to make next season their last at Giants Stadium, where
it costs $95,000 to open the stadium for a game. He said the league
is completing plans to build stadiums specifically for soccer in
northern New Jersey and in Los Angeles, the way Columbus is
building a stadium strictly for soccer that will be ready for next
season.
</P>
<P>
   As far as another team in the area, Logan said, ``There will be
a second team in New York between the year 2000 and 2002.''
Metromedia has the option of operating a second local team, and
Stillitano said Kluge and Subotnick have told him that they will do
so.
</P>
<P>
   If not, Metromedia can sell the rights to the team for a huge
profit in today's market. For example, the Los Angeles Galaxy,
whose investor operators paid $5 million to have a team, was sold
for $26 million last week to Philip F. Anschutz, a Denver
billionaire who also owns the Chicago and Colorado franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Logan added that he had told the mayor's office that MLS would
prefer that the second team play at Shea Stadium, but that he had
received no word from city hall regarding the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Stillitano was reluctant to talk in detail about Metromedia's
venture into New York. ``All I will say at this point is that we're
trying to establish ourselves in northern New Jersey before we
venture into New York,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A team in New York would make Metromedia the third investor
operator to own more than one team in the single-entity league.
Along with Anschutz, Lamar Hunt and his two sons own the Columbus
Crew and the Kansas City Wizards. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stillitano said he has met with Kluge and Subotnick about
Metromedia's option for a second team in the area and about ways to
improve the MetroStars. Among their decisions, Stillitano said, is
to sign Milutinovic for at least two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we've also talked about is buying a couple
of impact players,'' Stillitano said. ``That's what separates us
from the league's top teams. We have a good nucleus of young
players, but not impact players like Nowak and Etcheverry,'' he
said, referring to Chicago's Peter Nowak and Washington's Marco
Etcheverry.
</P>
<P>
   Nowak assisted on both Chicago goals in the 2-0 victory over
D.C. United and was named most valuable player in Sunday's
championship game at the Rose Bowl before a crowd of 51,350.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're behind the league's top teams, the LAs and DCs,''
Stillitano said. ``We need to improve, and the way to do that is by
getting a few stars that will have an impact. Except for Donadoni,
we haven't had that.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Donadoni of Italy left after two seasons, and the
MetroStars and the league failed to fill his void. Tab Ramos was
supposed to take over for Donadoni as the team's midfield general,
but knee surgery and duty with the United States national team
limited his effectiveness in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe one of our young players will be an impact player,''
Stillitano said. ``Bora is delighted at some of our young
players.'' He mentioned Brian Kelly, Billy Walsh, Ramiro Corrales,
Mike Petke, Mike Duhaney, Miles Joseph and Tim Howard. ``But along
with the young players, we need a good mix of veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the number of foreign players on each team to four from
five is one of the changes the league has adopted for next season.
Sunil Gulati, the league's deputy commissioner, said the change
will make it difficult to add new foreigners, but it is good for
the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've noticed that Americans are as good as the fifth
foreigner on most teams,'' Gulati said. ``Most teams have four
foreigners, anyway, so the reduction will not have an effect on the
quality of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The league's caliber of play improved a great deal this season
because of the signing of higher-quality foreign players,
especially by Chicago. The league also showed that four or five of
its teams are much better than the rest, which is common in leagues
around the world. What MLS wants is for the MetroStars to become
one of those elite teams.
</P>
<P>
   As Lee Stern, who owned the Chicago Sting of the defunct the
North American Soccer League, put it, ``You need a successful team
in New York because everybody uses that as a barometer.''

   NEW YORK _ ``We're in our second year of marketing the home,''
said Olivia Quist, sounding upbeat, as only a real-estate agent
with a hard-to-sell listing can.
</P>
<P>
   The house in question has a $25 million asking price, but that
includes the furniture and 10 acres of land near Phoenix. It is
Leona M. Helmsley's 20,000-square-foot contemporary, which nestles
into a mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``She bought it when Helmsley was so ill, to have a place with
warm weather to bring him,'' Ms. Quist said. ``Now that he's passed
away, she just isn't coming any more.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Helmsley is not giving up. She has signed Ms. Quist's
agency for another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has privacy, views, security,'' Ms. Quist said. And it has
an indoor pool with an underwater sound system that Mrs. Helmsley
added. It already had a film screening room, a gym, a dining room
that seats 24, a 36-foot waterfall and a powder room with 24-karat
gold faucets. Plus 12 other bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Did Ms. Quist expect it to take this long to sell?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes,'' she declared, saying it was not unusual for
expensive homes to be on the market for a long while.
</P>
<P>
   Should Mrs. Helmsley reduce the price and hope for a quick sale?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something I absolutely can't discuss,'' Ms. Quist
said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

<P>
   Daljit Dhaliwal is moving.
</P>
<P>
   She is the British news reader whose nightly reports for
Britain's ITN News had been carried on 19 public television
stations, including WLIW-TV, the Long Island station seen in much
of the New York region.
</P>
<P>
   Those stations dropped her for a program produced by the BBC.
But starting next Monday, she will be seen on WNET-TV, the flagship
for a new 44-station lineup that will carry a new version of her
program at 5:30 p.m. every day
</P>
<P>
   That is the move WNET-TV expected her to talk about when she was
in New York last week. But in conversation, she mentioned her other
move, from one flat in west London to another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tiring,'' she said. ``They say it's one of the most
stressful things you'll ever do in life, buying a property.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One can only wonder what the people at the next table thought.
</P>
<P>
   First three friends of the jazz violinist Stephane Grappelli,
who died last year at 89, scattered some of his ashes under a tree
near the Bethesda Fountain in Central Park on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Then the three, who included the New York restaurateur
Jean-Claude Baker, went to the Boathouse Cafe, where they had a
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   For three, they thought.
</P>
<P>
   But the maitre d'hotel said the reservation was for four, and
seated them at a table for four.
</P>
<P>
   A minute or two later an insect _ a dragonfly, Baker said _
alighted on the napkin at the empty place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stephane has just joined us,'' Baker said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

<P>
   After the taping of the VH-1 Fashion and Music Awards on Friday,
the rock musician Bryan Setzer was one of the few VIPs who went to
the VIP party at Chelsea Piers. Madonna, Ellen DeGeneres, Anne
Heche and Lou Reed were nowhere to be seen; the real VIP party, it
turned out, was at Moomba.
</P>
<P>
   But Setzer _ an alumnus of the Stray Cats who was nominated for
the most stylish music video for ``Jump, Jive an' Wail'' (but lost
to Janet Jackson) _ was at the crowded, nonexclusive Chelsea Piers
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as exclusive events go, I could really care less,'' he
said. ``Hey, I'm loyal to my fans.''

3-ACRE LEGACY OF THE A-BOMB IN NEW JERSEY AWAITS CLEANUP
</HEADLINE>
   (ll) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLESEX, N.J. _ In an industrial part of this suburban town,
behind a chain link fence topped by barbed wire and a pole with a
forlorn and tattered wind sock, is an unintended monument to the
atomic age: a three-acre, 20-foot-high mound of radioactive dirt
tightly sheathed in matte black polyethylene.
</P>
<P>
   The dirt, the remaining pile of what was once two, is on the
site of the Middlesex Sampling Plant, one of several top-secret
sites around the country where uranium was tested in the Manhattan
Project, which built the atomic bomb. But the speed with which the
country deciphered the atom and harnessed its destructive power has
not been duplicated in cleaning up the Middlesex site, 35 miles
southwest of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The secrecy surrounding the Middlesex plant was lifted more than
three decades ago, and since then residents and local officials
have tried, through a host of federal agencies, to clean up the
site, whose radioactivity is not considered dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Kohl has a furniture repair and refinishing shop next to
the site. His rear window looks out over the covered pile.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while you just don't notice it,'' Kohl said. ``I
didn't suspect what kind of work they were doing there when I
bought this place 25 years ago, but then these guys in white
protective suits started doing all this digging and testing back in
the early '80s.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl looked out at the pile and said, perhaps to convince
himself, ``I guess that pile will be gone one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the people of Middlesex were seeing the first tangible
steps toward cleanup _ one pile was taken away by the Army Corps of
Engineers last year _another Federal agency entered the picture.
Late last month, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that
it would add the site to the Superfund list by early December.
</P>
<P>
   One might think this would be an occasion for cheering. But
residents of this community of 13,500 are numb. They have already
waited decades for action. Now they fear that another layer of
bureaucracy will only push back the day that the site can finally
be declared clean.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA did not step in because of any new health threat. No
government agency has ever said that the site was a health hazard,
and no local group has ever made such a charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Superfund designation came mainly because, for the first
time, the agency took note of subsurface contamination at the site.
The agency also noted some minor leaks of contaminated water in
1996 that have since been corrected. According to Rich Cahill, a
regional spokesman for the EPA, there was a need to address some
low-level radioactivity in material up to five feet beneath the
asphalt surface of the Middlesex plant and the potential of more
ground water contamination.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of Middlesex add these findings to the long list
of problems and responses they have collected during the last 20 or
so years, enough to fill three borough Health Department file
cabinets full of studies, letters and minutes of hearings. They are
wary of adding a Superfund folder to the file cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid it means another level of bureaucracy and more
delay,'' said Kevin Sumner, an environmental health specialist with
the Middlesex Borough Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   For Raymond Reefer, who has lived across the street from the
fenced-in area for 21 years, the prospect of another agency getting
involved triggered all the nervous speculation of wondering about a
new neighbor. After all, he said, during the last two decades he
came to know the people plotting the cleanup of the site by their
first names. They swarmed over his house and property dozens of
times with their measuring devices. They paid his electric bills
when dust from demolition and digging required him to keep his
windows closed in summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That pile has been a real eyesore and a real pain in the
neck,'' Reefer said.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Reefer's friends who visited asked about the mounds
visible from his front porch, now seen through an autumn tangle of
bright yellow aster and delicate white fleabane. When he explained
about the radioactive dirt, they would kid him, asking whether he
glowed in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   The Middlesex plant was established in 1943 to sample ores from
the Belgian Congo for uranium, thorium, radium and beryllium and
then ship them to locations where weapons work was being done. In
1955, the Atomic Energy Commission took over the site and used it
for limited sampling of thorium-bearing ores until 1967, when it
decontaminated the buildings and grounds by sandblasting,
vacuuming, acid washes and soil removal. It was deemed clean by the
standards of the time, and the agency moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1969, the Middlesex location was used for a time as
a training site for the Marine Corps Reserves. But with the growing
national concern about environmental contaminants, in 1974, the
Department of Energy, which took over from the Atomic Energy
Commission, resumed control of the Middlesex location and 46 other
sites that figured in the development of nuclear weaponry and
nuclear energy. The goal was to do a more thorough cleanup of the
sites so that they could be safely used as commercial or
residential property.
</P>
<P>
   The Mayor of Middlesex, Ronald Dobies, said that well before
1974 the borough had been concerned about the plant. Awareness of
the site's original use came only in 1960, accidentally, when civil
defense officials carrying Geiger counters were stunned when their
counters started registering over the borough landfill.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They later found that in 1948 a contractor building an asphalt
loading area at the sampling plant less than a mile away had dumped
some of the dirt in the municipal landfill. Some of this dirt also
went out as ``clean fill'' to other projects, including the rectory
of Our Lady of Mount Virgin in adjacent Piscataway, Dobies said.
</P>
<P>
   All of this material was subsequently retrieved and returned to
the sampling plant site, and accumulated in two large mounds of
dirt and debris, both covered with and sitting on plastic liners to
keep moisture from seeping from the pile and carrying radiation to
the subsoil.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the most hazardous radioactive waste, which has a
half-life of hundreds of thousands of years, the low-level variety,
like that at Middlesex, has a half-life of as little as 90 days and
as long as 200 years. It tends to be material that has been
irradiated through exposure to other radioactive material. It is
not considered lethal, even after long exposure, but it could cause
illness or have uncertain long-term effects.
</P>
<P>
   As Federal and state environmental officials worked on cleanup
and removal plans, local residents were skeptical, Dobies said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't sure whether to believe the state and federal
governments when they kept telling us that there was no health
danger,'' he said, noting that the borough hired its own
consultants in the early 1980s to get an independent opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Reefer, the site's neighbor, did not believe the
borough's finding that there was no health hazard, and enlisted a
friend with a Geiger counter and some radiation expertise to
accompany him on clandestine, late-night forays to the sampling
plant site. They would run the Geiger counter over the grounds, he
said, and eventually he was satisfied that there was no danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site wasn't doing my property values any good, but it
seemed safe,'' Reefer said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, national debates raged over how to transport and
dispose of low-level radioactive waste safely, delaying final plans
for Middlesex. Also, budget cuts at the Department of Energy pushed
the Middlesex site further down the list of priority cleanup
locations. Three other sites in New Jersey _ in Maywood in Bergen
County, in Wayne in Passaic County and in Deepwater in Salem County
_ kept their high spots on the priority list. Those three sites are
being cleaned up now.
</P>
<P>
   The department came under increasing criticism from Congress for
not finishing the cleanups more quickly. By 1997, 24 of the 46
sites used for nuclear projects had been cleaned. At the insistence
of lawmakers like Rep. Robert Franks, whose district includes
Middlesex, the responsibility for the cleanups was switched to the
Army Corps of Engineers in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``That created an initial problem for us, because we had
developed a rapport with Bechtel Corp., which was doing the cleanup
of the site for the Department of Energy,'' Dobies said of the
company that was maintaining the radioactive sites and making plans
to remove the material. ``We fought it for a while, but decided to
try to build rapport with a new group. And so far, there has been
nothing negative with the Corps of Engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army Corps of Engineers, with some extra financing last
year, removed one of the two mounds to a federally operated
disposal site for low-level radioactivity in Utah. This part of the
cleanup cost $12 million. Allen Roos, director of the Middlesex
site for the Corps of Engineers, said that additional money is
expected in next year's budget, but it is not yet certain that the
corps will be removing the remaining pile right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we don't believe that EPA being involved is going to add
years on to the process or delay it any,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Department of Energy was heading the effort, it
projected completion of the cleanup of the remaining 22 sites on
the list by 2002, at a total cost of nearly $1 billion. But price
tags have varied, based on whether the site is to be cleaned for
commercial use or to a more pristine level for residential use. The
corps now says the cleanups will not be completed until 2006 at the
earliest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have a good program,'' Dobies said, ''but without
money to back it up, it goes nowhere.''

GIULIANI CAMPAIGNS WITH D'AMATO IN 3 BOROUGHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four years after he attacked Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato
as a threat to ethics in government, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
campaigned with the senator in Republican strongholds across the
city Monday, contending that D'Amato's influence within Congress'
Republican majority was vital to the city's well-being.
</P>
<P>
   As the Republicans toured three boroughs, D'Amato's Democratic
challenger, Rep. Charles E. Schumer, received the endorsement of
William J. Bratton, the former New York City police commissioner,
who praised Schumer's work in helping to pass a sweeping crime bill
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The dueling events featuring officials who have built national
reputations for fighting crime showed the importance of the issue
to both camps, even as violent-crime rates continue to fall.
</P>
<P>
   For D'Amato, the tour of Rego Park in Queens, Little Italy in
Manhattan and Bensonhurst and Crown Heights in Brooklyn also
provided an opportunity to reach out to the conservative Jewish and
Italian voters who represent his core constituencies in the city,
where he traditionally runs well behind his Democratic rivals. The
three-term senator's tour was his most vigorous day of campaigning
in the city this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for governor, Gov. George Pataki, the Republican
seeking re-election, was endorsed by State Sen. Alton R. Waldon
Jr., a Queens Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``All across New York state, crime is down and citizens feel
safer and more secure since Governor Pataki first took office,''
Waldon said at a Manhattan news conference with the governor.
``Business leaders are much more optimistic about the direction New
York is headed in and are providing more jobs for the working men
and women of this state.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of how important Pataki, who is enjoying high approval
ratings, has become to D'Amato's political survival, the two
Republicans are scheduled to begin four days of barnstorming
together across the state. Their tour will start Tuesday, when they
will hop-skip from Schenectady to Rochester, Niagara Falls,
Buffalo, and Hicksville, Nassau County.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Pataki's Democratic challenger, Peter Vallone, the
city council speaker, held a fund-raiser at the Sheraton New York
Hotel in midtown Manhattan that was expected to raise $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   In his five-minute speech to the crowd, Vallone compared Pataki
to a hologram for having refused to debate him. ``He's there, but
you can't seem to grasp him,'' Vallone said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Bratton described Schumer as ``a man who is largely
responsible for giving us many of the tools'' that helped the city
reduce crime. The 1994 crime bill provided financing for 100,000
police officers and increased penalties for an array of federal
crimes as well as banning assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato voted against the bill, punctuating his criticism that
it included unnecessary spending by singing ``Old MacDonald had
some pork'' on the Senate floor. Monday, Schumer replayed a
videotape recording of that 1994 performance, calling it ``probably
the most embarrassing spectacle ever by a New York senator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine Robert Wagner or Jacob Javits or Robert
Kennedy or Herbert Lehman singing `Old MacDonald' on the Senate
floor?'' Schumer asked during a news conference at his Manhattan
campaign office.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani sought to counter Bratton's campaign appearance by
describing D'Amato as a strong supporter of tougher sentences for
criminals. He also had some barbed comments for Bratton, who
resigned under pressure in 1996 after months of feuding with
Giuliani over credit for the city's declining crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's from Boston,'' Giuliani said of Bratton. ``What would he
know?''
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's events clearly posed some conflicts for Giuliani.
In 1994, he crossed party lines to endorse Gov. Mario Cuomo, a
Democrat, in his race against Pataki, a protege of D'Amato.
Giuliani warned then that, ``If the D'Amato-Pataki crew ever get
control, ethics will be trashed.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Giuliani said his 1994 remarks ``were based upon a
mistake I made in calculating how Governor Pataki would act, how
Senator D'Amato would act.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani had also strongly supported the 1994 crime bill and is
an advocate of gun control, which D'Amato consistently votes
against. Monday, Giuliani said that Schumer ``has done some good
things for the city.'' But he sidestepped his differences with
D'Amato over restricting guns, saying that gun control and tougher
sentences were both essential to reducing crime.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also repeatedly praised D'Amato's work in directing
federal aid to New York City's mass transit system and hospitals,
adding that it would ``make no sense'' to replace a senior senator
with a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a senator who is among the most powerful in the United
States Senate, in the party that is going to control the United
States Senate for the next two years, and probably the next four or
six years'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   At his events, D'Amato continued his attack on Schumer's
attendance record this year. And in Crown Heights, where he
received endorsements from several Lubavitcher community leaders,
D'Amato suggested that Schumer had not done enough to help Jewish
residents during the 1991 riots in that neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``May we all have the courage to step up, not just when it is
politically expedient, but whenever a community or people are in
need,'' said D'Amato, who was wearing a yarmulke and was surrounded
by a crowd of bearded Lubavitcher men.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's campaign said that Schumer was in close contact with
Lubavitcher leaders throughout the riot and played an important
role in pushing the Justice Department to continue its
investigation into the murder of Yankel Rosenbaum, a rabbinical
student killed during the disturbance.

VOTERS ARE ASKED TO CEDE POWER ON HORSE-RACE ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ New Jersey's voters will be asked next week
to amend the state Constitution to give up a half-century of power
to select the types of betting allowed on horse racing, and
ultimately make it easier to introduce off-track betting and
betting by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The question on the ballot Nov. 3 might seem, from its
legalistic wording, like a simple procedural change. But the dry
words mask a long struggle for New Jersey's four race tracks and
for many horse owners, breeders, and trainers who are seeking ways
to fight competition from the state lottery, casinos in Atlantic
City and tracks in neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot does not mention two wagering options long coveted by
New Jersey's slumping racing industry: off-track betting and
betting by telephone. Both types of gambling are well entrenched in
New York, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. But if voters approve the
constitutional amendment, only legislative approval would be needed
to approve off-track and telephone betting in the future and
eliminate any risk of the public's rejecting them in the voting
booth.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Zukin, chairman of the department of public policy at the
Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers
University, said he thinks about three-quarters of the voters will
learn about the proposed change for the first time when they enter
the voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the ballot statement is so convoluted, people will have
trouble understanding what they're being asked to do,'' Zukin said.
``It's terribly confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's Constitution, adopted in 1947, prohibited the
Legislature from adopting any form of gambling without the prior
approval of voters. Daytime parimutuel wagering at state tracks
predated the Constitution. But the creation of casinos, the lottery
and various forms of bingo and raffles all required the passage of
constitutional amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, New Jersey voters have been chilly to
liberalizing betting on horse races. They easily approved betting
on night races in 1966 and on simulcast races _ televised races
beamed into New Jersey tracks from other states' tracks _ in 1985.
But in 1980, voters rejected betting on races on Sundays, and 10
years passed before the measure returned to the ballot. Sunday
betting was narrowly approved then, as was betting on simulcasts at
the Atlantic City casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Racing-industry officials reject suggestions that they purposely
kept off-track and telephone betting off the ballot next month out
of fear of rejection. Instead, they say, they want to focus only on
eliminating future referendums because it is too time-consuming to
wait for Election Day to seek relaxation of gambling restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they say, the casinos and the lottery system no
longer need voter approval to expand their gambling options. And,
industry officials point out, tracks in New York and Pennsylvania
need only legislative approval to broaden their betting options.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constitutional restriction is handicapping the
horse-racing industry,'' said Leon Zimmerman, a spokesman for the
Standardbred Breeders and Owners Association of New Jersey. ``It's
a fairness issue.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the industry is not certain now what types of new
betting it would seek from the Legislature if the amendment passed,
even though a study commission created by Gov. Christie Whitman
said last winter that off-track and telephone betting were crucial
to the future of the state's tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's campaign has been modest. It has hired one of the
most powerful lobbying firms in Trenton, Public Strategies/Impact,
to direct it. But so far, the industry has raised only $50,000 for
the campaign. All of the money came from the Atlantic City Race
Track, which closed last spring and now wants to build a stylish
simulcast betting parlor on its property.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Public Strategies/Impact said they are hoping for
more money in the coming days to broaden the campaign beyond a few
radio advertisements and the distribution of fliers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   No formal opposition has developed, but some members of the New
Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemen's Benevolent Association, which
represents about 6,000 owners, trainers and breeders, are fretting
about the possibility of state tracks' emphasizing off-track
simulcast and betting parlors over live racing.
</P>
<P>
   One association official who spoke on the condition of anonymity
pointed out that the state's three thoroughbred tracks _ the
Meadowlands, Monmouth Park, and Garden State Race Track _ all
recently asked the New Jersey Racing Commission to shorten their
1999 seasons by a combined 56 days. This year, live racing at the
three tracks totaled 207 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Killing the live card hurts horsemen,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the industry, the New Jersey Council of Churches, which
years ago opposed liberalizing betting on horse racing, has been
silent. And the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey does
not take positions on efforts to broaden forms of legalized
gambling, said Kevin O'Neill, deputy director of the state chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Any future expansion of betting on horse races would create more
compulsive gamblers, O'Neill said, but the racing industry has
acknowledged its social responsibility and has promised to provide
the chapter with money to broaden its anti-gambling education
programs if phone and off-track betting are ever approved and
industry revenues increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked for one-half of 1 percent,'' O'Neill said. ``If we
got $100,000 to $200,000, it would be fine.''

MANY DONORS TO GOVERNOR DO BUSINESS WITH STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In his quest for another term, Gov. George Pataki and
his fellow Republicans have mounted the most successful
fund-raising operation in New York history, drawing support from
thousands of donors, many of whom share a common trait: They do
business with the state.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and the Republican State Committee have collected more
than $33 million since 1995, helping him ward off some formidable
would-be challengers and allowing him to spend well over $1 million
a week in the final stretch of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of dollars came from donors with specific interests in
action by the sprawling state government, from regulatory changes
on issues like rent laws and utility rates, to consulting contracts
and construction projects worth as much as tens of millions of
dollars each.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the Pataki campaign or the party solicited
donations around the same time that contributors had matters before
the Pataki administration, according to interviews and records.
</P>
<P>
   While some of these companies and individuals have done business
with the state for years and have contributed to whoever is in
power, Pataki has attracted more money from a wider spectrum of
businesses, according to an analysis of campaign-finance records.
And many began giving large amounts only when the state was making
decisions important to their bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic contributed $45,000 just as it sought approval to
expand. Developers gave more than $400,000 while they were
competing to buy the site of the New York Coliseum in Manhattan.
And a consulting firm that won a $15 million state contract sent
three donations totaling $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   One example is a Long Island insurance conglomerate called the
Robert Plan, which in July 1997 became one of the biggest backers
of the Republican State Committee in recent years, giving $100,900.
</P>
<P>
   Less then two months later, the state Insurance Department
agreed to transfer control of most of the assets of two nearly
bankrupt insurance companies in Binghamton, to the Robert Plan,
giving it 23,000 new policies and an outpost in upstate New York.
The department and the conglomerate said the contributions _ the
first and only ones it has made to the campaign or party in
Pataki's term _ had nothing to do with the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   But that set of transactions, and others like it, shows how the
Pataki campaign and the Republican fund-raising apparatus have
benefited both from the powers of incumbency and from the state's
relatively weak campaign-finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with many other states, New York has high contribution
limits and no constraints on who can give to candidates. The
disclosure rules are lax _ the Pataki campaign has often released
lists of contributors in tiny type and alphabetized by first name,
making analyzing the records difficult _ and the loopholes are
easily exploited. There is little enforcement of the laws.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Pataki described the state's
campaign-finance system as ``dreadful,'' but he did not offer any
proposal to change it.
</P>
<P>
   He and his campaign aides declined to be interviewed for this
article. In response to questions, a spokesman for the campaign,
Michael Marr, read a one-sentence statement: ``These reckless
insinuations are the product of an overactive imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's aides have previously defended his fund raising, saying
no one contributes because they are pressured or receive favors.
The aides say donors are motivated by their support for his
policies on issues like crime, welfare and the economy. They also
point out that people with no interests before the state have given
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1994 election campaign, the most expensive in the state's
history, Pataki raised nearly $15 million, about $3 million more
than the Democratic incumbent, Gov. Mario Cuomo. Pataki has
collected more than $20 million for his current campaign. His
Democratic opponent, Peter Vallone, the New York City Council
speaker, has taken in less than $6 million, most of which he spent
in the primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's only rival in campaign spending is the Independence
Party candidate, Thomas Golisano, a businessman from Rochester who
has vowed to pour $20 million of his own money into the race.
</P>
<P>
   It is legal for Pataki and other candidates to accept money from
these donors as long as there is not a specific trading of
government actions for contributions. But the practice, while
widespread, has stirred criticism in recent years from advocacy
groups, which say the timing of these donations is often
questionable.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Robert Plan, the party received a $69,900
donation from the conglomerate's president, Robert Wallach, on July
3, 1997, the same day it got $31,000 from the Robert Plan. Two
months later, after long negotiations, Pataki announced the
transfer of business to the Robert Plan.
</P>
<P>
   The state insurance superintendent, Neil Levin, said in an
interview that the department did not know about the contributions.
``That in no way was discussed or factored in,'' he said. He said
an outside consultant helped to manage the deal, which was approved
by a state judge. He said no one else expressed interest in the two
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, the Robert Plan assumed most of the policies
held by two nearly bankrupt companies, Home Mutual and New York
Merchant Bakers, after the state determined that their collapse
would harm policyholders and took control of the companies.
</P>
<P>
   In return for getting the new policies, the Robert Plan, based
in Bethpage, promised to pay some of the companies' debts and keep
most premiums level for a year.
</P>
<P>
   John Reiersen, president of Eagle Insurance, the subsidiary of
the Robert Plan that absorbed the other companies, said the
contributions did not play a role. ``There was not any particular
quid pro quo here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For companies that are heavily regulated, gaining a favorable
ruling from the state administration can have a sharp effect on
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, two of the region's largest communications companies,
Bell Atlantic and Cablevision Systems, asked the state Public
Service Commission to approve important expansion plans. In both
instances, the companies applied around the time that they or their
executives donated large amounts for the first time to the Pataki
campaign or the party, according to records.
</P>
<P>
   One plan involved the sale of cable systems. On June 9, 1997,
Cablevision announced that it was acquiring several cable systems
in New York from Tele-Communications Inc., which in turn received
33 percent of Cablevision. Some consumer advocates charged that TCI
and Cablevision were forming an illegal alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days later, the state party received a total of $45,000
from three members of the Dolan family, which controls Cablevision.
The plan was approved in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolans had not donated before during Pataki's term and
Cablevision previously had given a total of $2,600 to his campaign
and the party.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schueler, a spokesman for Cablevision, said the Dolans
had contributed at a long-scheduled fund-raising event. ``Their
participation was not related to any business matter, but an
expression of support for Governor Pataki and his economic
policies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, David Flanagan, a spokesman for the Public
Service Commission, said approval of the Cablevision plan was
routine. ``The application was subject to full public scrutiny
before it reached the commission for a decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic went to the state seeking permission to offer
long-distance service in New York, a move that it said would offer
consumers more choices. Long-distance companies objected.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks after Bell Atlantic filed with the commission in
November, the Pataki campaign, while not mentioning the pending
state decision, asked for a donation, said Paul Crotty, a group
president at Bell Atlantic. On Dec. 12, 1997, the campaign received
$25,000 from the company and $20,000 from Ivan Seidenberg, its
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do it before because we hadn't been asked before,''
Crotty said. He denied a link between the donations and the
commission, saying, ``Governor Pataki has been pretty good to any
company that is like Bell Atlantic.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan emphasized that the commission set rigorous conditions
for Bell Atlantic to offer long-distance service, which the company
is now trying to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Developers have been another major source of contributions, as
they have been for politicians of both major parties.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest development projects handled by Pataki
administration was the sale of the New York Coliseum, perhaps the
most coveted development site in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the state awarded the project this summer to a
partnership of Related Cos. and Time Warner, the nine development
teams that had bid, as well as their principals, had contributed a
total of more than $400,000 to the Pataki campaign and the party,
records show.
</P>
<P>
   An executive on one of the losing development teams said
officials of the Pataki campaign and the party often solicited all
nine teams, particularly the five finalists. The Coliseum was not
mentioned in these requests for money, but the context was
understood, the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was such a huge amount of pressure on all of these
guys,'' said the executive, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
``The unsaid dictum was that if you do business with the
government, you had better support your government.''
</P>
<P>
   The state picked Related Cos. and Time Warner in July 1998. On
May 18, the Republican State Committee received $10,000 from
Related. On June 9, it received $50,000 from the Time Warner parent
corporation, the first time it had given to either the governor or
the state party.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Adler, a spokesman for Time Warner, said, ``The notion
that we gave the money in exchange for anything to do with the
Coliseum project is ridiculous.'' State officials denied that there
was any link.
</P>
<P>
   But the Coliseum bidders were not the biggest supporters in the
real-estate industry. Landlords lobbying to end rent regulations
were.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the Rent Stabilization Association, the landlords'
group, and its officers have given a total of nearly $1 million.
Pataki has been more open to changing the rent rules than his
predecessors, though he fell short of fulfilling the hopes of
landlord groups last year when he brokered a compromise with the
Democrats that left the system of rent regulations largely in
place.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of state action and political contributions is
highlighted in a consulting contract awarded to the firm of
Deloitte &AMP; Touche.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 and 1997, Deloitte &AMP; Touche was one of three consulting
firms seeking a $15 million contract to improve a state health-care
and nutrition program. During the bidding, it donated $25,000 to
the party. In the two months after the firm won in February 1998,
it contributed $15,000 more to the party and $10,000 to the Pataki
campaign. Before the bidding, the firm had given a total of $4,000.
The two other firms made no contributions, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hinckley, a spokesman for the state Health Department,
said Deloitte &AMP; Touche received the project because it had the
lowest bid and the best application. Deloitte &AMP; Touche said its
donations were ``unrelated to the work.''

IN CONNECTICUT, KENNELLY FACES GAP OF HISTORIC DIMENSIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (ll) 
 By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ As Rep. Barbara Kennelly's car headed back
toward this capital city after a recent campaign event, she turned
to glimpse the red maple and golden beech trees on the hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't that look beautiful?'' she said. ``That's the only
good thing about campaigns: you can see the leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a unusual statement for a candidate for governor and
someone who has spent more than two decades in public office.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, she added emphatically, ``I like serving.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly speaks with great enthusiasm about the
achievements of her 17 years as a Democratic congresswoman from
Connecticut. And many of her allies contend that she would bring to
the State House the same attributes she took to Congress: an
ability to compromise, a civil demeanor, and a set of liberal
principles about the responsibility of government to help those in
need.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, those supporters acknowledge that she has
little stomach for what it takes to get there.
</P>
<P>
   With a week left until the election, polls show Mrs. Kennelly so
far behind her highly popular opponent, Gov. John Rowland _ 48
percentage points at last count _ that some here wonder whether she
is heading for one of the biggest political humiliations since John
Peters, a National Republican, defeated Calvin Willey, a Democrat,
by 44 percentage points in 1832.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, quite honestly, that it would have been difficult for
any Democrat to knock out the governor,'' said James McBrayar, an
assistant professor of American politics at the University of
Hartford. ``That said, I think this was a largely invisible
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Mrs. Kennelly's missteps have been well documented.
Although polls showed her running even with the incumbent when she
announced her candidacy a year ago, she waited many months before
beginning a television advertising campaign and failed to build a
strong campaign organization. It is also likely that the early
polls were skewed by her high name recognition, and therefore gave
a misleading indication of her strength.
</P>
<P>
   But much of her campaign problems seem traceable to her
political style. She clearly loves the business of governing and
talks passionately about the deal-making that goes on out of the
public eye, the collegiality of Washington and the intense,
late-night work of getting bills passed.
</P>
<P>
   But just as clearly, Mrs. Kennelly, 62, does not have a taste
for the more public, retail aspects of politics. She says she
enjoys meeting people on the campaign trail, but she recoils from
publicity stunts and negative campaigning, two techniques that are
usually effective. As a Congresswoman, she achieved a quiet style
partly by doing without a press secretary to promote her and by
avoiding outspoken comments, preferring to use her reputation as a
team player to get legislation passed. And when she ran for
re-election every two years, it was usually against lackluster
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Working most effectively out of the limelight seems to be a
family trait. Mrs. Kennelly's father, John Bailey, was chairman of
the Democratic National Committee from 1961 until 1969, and ran the
state Democratic Party from 1946 until his death in 1975. As the
party boss, Bailey was known as a consummate backroom deal-maker.
</P>
<P>
   Although some critics contend that she is too rooted in the
politics of the past, Mrs. Kennelly argues forcefully that she is
``not an old-style politician.'' But her stump style seems to
reflect an ambivalent attitude toward modern campaigning. It can be
forceful at one point, then turn quickly uncomfortable the next.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent Democratic town committee meeting in Rocky Hill she
warmed up what had been a largely silent audience with a rousing
speech. Explaining her decision to run, she said: ``I was looking
back at Connecticut and I could see we were not what we had been.
Not first any longer in education, or preserving our environment.
Not first in protecting our kids. So I decided to run for governor
and you all supported me. Well, let me tell you: if I thought I was
right then, I know I am right now!''
</P>
<P>
   But 15 minutes later she gave a somewhat disjointed speech at a
meeting of a N.A.A.C.P. chapter, shifting awkwardly between her
campaign theme of ``two Connecticuts,'' praise for the hiring
record of the federal government and a call for equal wages for
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Even her ardent supporters acknowledge that her campaign style
suffers by comparison with that of her opponent, Rowland, a
first-term Republican who is 21 years her junior. He tends to be
smooth, quick on his feet and quick to utter sound-bites, while
Mrs. Kennelly is more halting and deferential than Rowland, who
tends to be more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Any Democrat, no matter how good a campaigner, would have a
tough time this year against Rowland, whose term has been a period
of economic gains and budget surpluses. A poll conducted by
Quinnipiac College found that 83 percent of the state's registered
voters are satisfied ``with the way things are going'' in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland has also made Mrs. Kennelly's run more difficult,
according to many politicians here, by moderating some of his
positions. Last year, for example, he successfully reached
compromises with the Democratic Legislature on tax cuts and health
care.
</P>
<P>
   Since Mrs. Kennelly's first race for Congress in a special
election in January 1982, she has faced no serious contenders in
her largely Democratic district around Hartford. As a result, she
had no need to undertake big media efforts, debate an opponent or
respond to serious criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In a belated recognition of the importance of professional
strategists, she hired both a new manager and a new spokesman in
the middle of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly also failed in the early stages to pick a single
theme to shape her campaign. In recent weeks a friend of Mrs.
Kennelly's, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., has been urging her to
hammer away at a single message and to promote herself. ``Barbara
Mikulski told me, `The problem with you, Barbara, is that you are
not shameless,' '' she said.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition, few of Mrs. Kennelly's allies have seemed eager to
attack the governor very hard, fearful perhaps of alienating voters
who support a popular incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   When early polls showed her running even with Rowland, several
prominent Democrats were urging her to make the race, but now that
her campaign has turned sour, they have not been on the trail with
her. Indeed, at the Rocky Hill rally, three of the statewide
candidates who share the Democratic ticket with her _ Comptroller
Nancy Wyman, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, and Susan
Bysiewicz, a candidate for Secretary of State _ did not mention
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats and Republicans are both campaigning on the idea
that there is nothing wrong,'' said Bill Curry, who lost to Rowland
in 1994 and was hoping for a rematch but bowed out after Mrs.
Kennelly entered. ``Barbara's challenge is to show what really is
wrong and how you would fix that. And it is hard to do that
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   She has steadfastly refused to make her criticism of Rowland
personal, although she has criticized him on his administration's
efforts on foster care, environmental cleanup and higher education
financing. ``If I had to go personal I just never would have run,''
Mrs. Kennelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Reiter, a University of Connecticut political science
professor, said Mrs. Kennelly had chosen safe issues to push during
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a well-regarded incumbent,'' Reiter said, ``you
have to throw the rule book out the window. And she is not one to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly resists analyzing her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to do an obituary on the campaign,'' she snapped
in a recent interview. ``There will be plenty of time for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly's campaign aides acknowledge that they have no
miracle strategy she can use to close the gap between her and
Rowland. Over the weekend, the next to last before the election,
she spent most of Sunday at home, attended only four minor events,
attended no rallies of her own and gave no major speeches. On
Monday, she visited a high school in Windham, where few of those
listening to her stump speech were even eligible to vote. Her
schedule over the final days will be busier, but the campaign will
concentrate only on traditional Democratic constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Hartford, Mrs. Kennelly attended parochial schools
here and Trinity College, a Catholic women's college in Washington.
Then she began volunteering for Catholic Family Services, providing
aid to poor Hartford families.
</P>
<P>
   She ran for a City Council seat in Hartford in 1975 and won.
After her husband lost his speakership in the state House of
Representatives, she successfully ran for Secretary of the State in
1978. Then in 1982 she ran for the United States House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, she won a coveted place on the Ways and Means
Committee. In 1991, she was appointed to a leadership post as
deputy whip, and then in 1994 became the highest-ranking woman in
the House when she was elected vice chairwoman of the House
Democratic Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland's campaign has attacked Mrs. Kennelly for voting for
higher taxes, for failing to introduce legislation to help the
Hartford schools and for coming late to the issue of reforming
health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Mrs. Kennelly said that although she had voted to
raise taxes, she also voted for $275 billion in tax cuts last year.
She said that because she did not sit on the education committee,
she had little chance to introduce education bills, and that when
she contacted the federal Education Department on behalf of
Hartford, Rowland's office spurned the help. And she said she had
fought for better health care throughout her career.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say that she has a record of getting things done.
``The tragic thing is Barbara has a lot to offer,'' said Carl
Schiessl, a Democratic state representative who is retiring. ``She
is a tough, thoughtful, classy politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland has also criticized Mrs. Kennelly for casting votes
against welfare reform. She did vote against some reform provisions
in committee, but Congressional records show that she also voted in
favor of the final bill signed by President Clinton. She also
points to a law she pushed helping low-income families buy homes.
And Mrs. Kennelly also drafted the bill that became the basis for
the 1993 expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is
intended to help lift poor working families out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew long before reform became popular that our welfare
system was awful, that it locked women and children into a terrible
life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although her influence declined when the Republicans took over
Congress, she helped draft a law during the 1997-98 Congressional
term to allow people receiving Federal disability money to keep
some of their financial benefits and their medical coverage when
they start working.
</P>
<P>
   That law was what brought her to Torrington last week to receive
an award at Prime Time House, a nonprofit program that helps
prepare mentally ill adults for work. The event produced one of
those moments where the awkwardness disappears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the sense of freedom here,'' she said as she came to
the end of her prepared remarks. ``You can feel it.'' To illustrate
her point, she told of an encounter a few minutes before with a
woman named Karen, a member of Prime Time House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karen said: `I hate politicians,''' she recounted, as the
audience laughed. ``I said, `Oh, no, no. You can hate politics, but
don't hate politicians.' She said, `I hate politicians,''' Mrs.
Kennelly said as the audience, most of whom seemed to know Karen
well, laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Does that make you feel better?' She said, `Yes!' I
said, `Good, go right ahead and hate politicians.''' At that, the
audience gave Mrs. Kennelly a standing ovation.

RULING AGAINST TESTIMONY-FOR-LENIENCY JOLTS COURT SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert a new graf, 3rd graf from end)  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA, Kan. _ Every day in courts across the country,
witnesses take the stand in exchange for favorable treatment from
prosecutors. Some people call them informers. Prosecutors call them
essential.
</P>
<P>
   So it was a jolt to law-enforcement officials across the country
when a three-judge federal appeals court ruled this summer that
federal prosecutors could no longer use the testimony of witnesses,
possibly facing criminal charges, who had been promised leniency.
Promises of favorable treatment, the court said, violated the
federal law prohibiting bribery.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which some lawyers say may be the first successful
challenge under the federal bribery law to the practice of offering
witnesses leniency, a centerpiece of the legal system since
Colonial times, has triggered an unprecedented national examination
in the courts, in Congress and among legal scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Since the ruling, which is now under review by the full federal
appeals court in Denver, courts in virtually every state have been
asked to bar leniency deals, bills have been introduced in Congress
to negate the effect of the panel's decision and legal scholars
have been debating whether prosecutors have grown too reliant on
the use of informers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the culture of this country, nobody likes a snitch, yet
that has become the crux of the criminal justice system,'' said
Steven Zeidman, a professor of criminal law at New York University
Law School. ``But nobody likes to think about it, and now we're
being forced to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal bribery law says that ``whoever'' offers ``anything
of value to any person'' for testimony commits a crime. In its July
1 ruling, the three-judge panel said that ``whoever'' includes
federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judicial process is tainted and justice cheapened when
factual testimony is purchased, whether with leniency or money,''
the panel said in a drug case that began here.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, the ruling was annulled by the full 12-member 10th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Denver, which decided it should
review a decision with such far-reaching consequences. The full
court is to hear the case next month.
</P>
<P>
   In its original ruling, the three-judge panel ordered a new
trial for the defendant, Sonya Singleton, a 25-year-old mother of
two children. At her trial in 1997 on charges of being involved in
a drug conspiracy and money-laundering, she was identified as part
of a drug distribution scheme by a Wichita cocaine dealer, who was
then given a reduced sentence in exchange for his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Until the full appeals court decided to review the case, the
ruling was binding on all the federal courts in the six states of
the 10th Circuit: Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   But because circuit courts are second in importance only to the
Supreme Court, the ruling was seen as damaging to prosecutors
nationally. In legal papers, the Justice Department said the
decision by the three-judge panel to ``make a criminal out of
nearly every federal prosecutor'' was an ``absurd result.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials here and in Washington, who are
working together on the appeal because of its national importance,
declined to be interviewed. But in their legal filings, they say
the panel's ruling could cripple prosecutors. During the short time
it was in effect, the ruling ``caused chaos in the District Courts
and U.S. attorney's offices in this circuit and significant
disruption throughout the rest of the country,'' the Justice
Department filing says.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers said, for example, that the ruling
paralyzed organized crime prosecutions because it was unclear
whether prosecutors could rely on the testimony of crucial
cooperating witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers said the ruling was far from absurd and exposed
a flaw in the American justice system that had been ignored too
long. In an interview here, Ms. Singleton's lawyer, John Wachtel,
said prosecutors everywhere had perverted the justice system by
offering leniency to criminals so they could win cases, even
against innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from a federal prison in Texas, Ms.
Singleton said it was unfair that prosecutors had a tool as potent
as freedom to offer witnesses. ``Who wouldn't testify against
somebody,'' she said, ``even if it's a lie, just so they can go
home?'' She says she is innocent; she is serving a four-year term
while she appeals her conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers has filed a
friend-of-the-court brief urging the court to support Ms.
Singleton's appeal. And defense lawyers from coast to coast said
that no topic had received more attention this fall than the
Singleton ruling. Although the Singleton case deals only with
federal prosecutors, defense lawyers have begun to file similar
challenges in many states that have bribery statutes with
provisions similar to the federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel said that if the full appeals court reversed the panel's
decision, he would ask the Supreme Court to review the case.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts say that whatever the merits of the argument
in the Singleton case, the panel's original ruling would tie the
legal system in knots because prosecutors use offers of leniency so
frequently.
</P>
<P>
   If the ruling is affirmed, said Roscoe Howard Jr., a professor
of criminal law at the University of Kansas School of Law, ``the
system would grind to a halt.'' Howard, a former federal
prosecutor, said that without leniency offers, defendants would
have no incentive to cooperate and prosecutors would be forced to
try every case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a government attorney can't make these sorts of deals,''
Howard said, ``physically I don't think our court system could
handle the number of trials that would come through.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some judges across the country have been hostile to the panel's
ruling. Since it was published on July 1, at least 16 federal
courts have published opinions after defense lawyers asked judges
to bar the testimony of cooperating witnesses. Of those, 13 of the
judges said the panel's decision was a flawed challenge to a
fundamental legal rule. Many other judges are thought to have made
similar rulings informally.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the rulings expressed fury or amazement that a
court would jeopardize so fundamental a tool. Judge Frederic
Smalkin of U.S. District Court in Maryland called the panel's
ruling ``amazingly unsound, not to mention nonsensical.''
</P>
<P>
   Several judges have noted that in the 50-year history of the
federal bribery law, no one had apparently suggested that
prosecutors were violating the law by offering witnesses leniency.
Several judges have also said that deals with cooperating witnesses
were standard practice beginning before the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling rejecting a defense request to bar a witness'
testimony, Judge Federico Moreno of the federal court in Florida
said, ``The holding of the Singleton panel would dangerously
disable the government's investigatory and prosecutorial powers.''
</P>
<P>
   But some federal judges have said that their job is to interpret
the law, not create it. Congress, said judges in Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., and Knoxville, Tenn., did not exclude prosecutors when it
drew up the bribery law. Prosecutors, therefore, must be covered by
the law, they ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Some judges have said that promising a defendant a reduced
sentence, no matter how common, could encourage false testimony.
``Regardless of the good faith of the individual prosecutor,'' said
District Court Judge Ginger Berrigan of Louisiana, ``any inducement
is as much if not more a temptation to fabricate than it is to tell
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel said it was to be expected that some judges would be
resistant to a new idea. Judges, he said, seem trapped in a ``Well,
come on, we've been doing it forever'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   But he said major legal changes had often come from a single
case, like the 1966 Miranda decision, which declared that all
criminal defendants must be informed of their rights.
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel, 53, said he did not know of an earlier case in which a
defense lawyer had claimed that a leniency deal was a violation of
the federal bribery law. In the Singleton case, he said, the idea
occurred to him as he struggled to defend his client against the
testimony of a cocaine dealer, Napoleon Douglas. Douglas had been a
friend of Ms. Singleton's boyfriend, who was also charged in a drug
distribution scheme that prosecutors called one of the biggest in
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel, a trial lawyer in one of Wichita's biggest law firms,
was appointed to defend Ms. Singleton because she could not afford
to hire her own lawyer. While he was working on the case, he said,
he came across an article written by a California lawyer who said
that it was unfair that prosecutors could offer incentives to
witnesses but defense lawyers could not.
</P>
<P>
   When the trial of Ms. Singleton began last year, Wachtel
unsuccessfully raised the issue of the bribery statute with the
federal judge in Wichita, Frank Theis. From the bench, Theis issued
an eight-word ruling: ``This statute does not apply to the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Singleton was convicted and sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel appealed and again raised the issue of the bribery
statute. The three-judge panel assigned to hear the case included
the chief judge of the appeals court, Stephanie Seymour, appointed
by President Carter, and two judges appointed by Presidents Reagan
and Bush, David Ebel and Paul Kelly Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts say the three-judge panel may not have fully
examined the practical consequences of its ruling. Because the
issue had not been faced by other judges, the panel members may
have considered the case almost in scholarly terms, these experts
say. But, faced with anxious prosecutors, federal district judges
across the country have been forced to confront the consequences of
such a ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In a densely worded 18-page opinion, the panel examined
precedents as far back as the Magna Carta, which imposed limits on
the exercise of sovereign power. The law prohibiting ``whoever''
from offering a witness anything of value in exchange for testimony
should apply, the judges said, to prosecutors as well as to
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decency, security and liberty alike,'' the panel said,
``demand that government officials shall be subject to the same
rules of conduct that are commands to the citizen.''

NEW POLITICAL EQUATIONS IN THE MIDEAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times will say in an editorial Tuesday, Oct. 27: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The weary Mideast bargainers of Wye Plantation will not find
much rest in the weeks ahead. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of
Israel and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, now face the
fights of their political lives back home.
</P>
<P>
   Both men redefined their political identities in negotiating the
new peace agreement. Netanyahu, after five years of criticizing the
Oslo peace agreements and telling Jewish settlers he would yield no
more territory on the West Bank, belatedly embraced Oslo's formula
of land for peace. He is now gambling his political career on
carving out a new majority of the broad Israeli center, which could
let him break free from his current allies on the religious and
settler right.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who for a decade has tried to preserve Palestinian unity
by equivocating about terrorism, finally closed the door on any
return to confrontation and violence. Hamas and other violent
opponents of Oslo are now likely to redouble their efforts to
challenge his authority at home and undermine his credibility with
Israelis through new terrorist outrages.
</P>
<P>
   The time to break free from the politics of stalemate had
clearly arrived, for reasons that were evident at the White House
signing ceremony. King Hussein of Jordan, long a stalwart
peacemaker, is now frail from cancer and chemotherapy. Arafat's
trembling lips testified to his failing health. Prime Minister
Netanyahu evokes a new generation of Israelis who are reluctant to
shoulder lifelong military duty.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu and Arafat showed great courage in changing their
positions. But the first responses have been rude parliamentary
challenges to Netanyahu and new violence from Palestinian and
Israeli extremists. The main opposition party, Labor, has promised
to assure ratification for the new peace agreement and will protect
the Netanyahu government from right-wing challenges for at least
the next two weeks. But after that, political warfare is likely as
Labor and others challenge Netanyahu for the center ground.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's challenge is even greater. With Monday's murderous
attack on an Israeli security guard in Hebron he must move firmly
to capture and punish those who kill in the name of Palestine. With
the apparent reprisal murder of a Palestinian by a West Bank
settler, Netanyahu needs to show the same firmness against Jewish
extremists.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat must also begin to allow more constructive forms of
political debate in Palestinian-administered areas. Too often he
has confused cracking down on terror with cracking down on peaceful
dissent. There must be legitimate channels for nonviolent political
discussion and debate. Israeli and Palestinian politics must now
catch up with the changes made by Netanyahu and Arafat. If they do
not, the promise of peace may again be betrayed. &QL;

KILLING OF DOCTOR BECOMES A FACTOR IN POLITICAL RACES
</HEADLINE>
   (ll) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The killing of Dr. Barnett Slepian, a gynecologist in Buffalo
who performed abortions, has become a factor in at least two
campaigns in New York, say political consultants and some campaign
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for attorney general, the Democratic candidate,
Eliot Spitzer, who favors abortion rights, has moved quickly to
make the anti-abortion position of his opponent, Attorney General
Dennis Vacco, a central issue in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And in the tight race for U.S. Senate, while the Democrat,
Charles Schumer, another abortion-rights supporter, has not raised
Slepian's death himself, his aides say it puts a new emphasis on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian was shot in the back on Friday night as he stood in his
kitchen. No suspects have been identified. Even before the killing,
Schumer was tyring to draw more attention to the anti-abortion
record of his opponent, Senator Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican who
is also running on the Right to Life Party line.
</P>
<P>
   In a New York Times/CBS News poll completed on Saturday, 69
percent of those polled said they did not know D'Amato's position
on abortion, and only 19 percent knew that he opposed abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Now events are doing the work for Schumer. Slepian's death was
among the first topics raised in Saturday night's debate between
the two men, and it was instantly followed by a question to D'Amato
on whether he opposed first-trimester abortions for adult women.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League plans to hold a news conference to screen a television
advertisement _ made last week, before Slepian died _ featuring
Emily Lyons, a nurse who was badly wounded earlier this year in the
bombing of an abortion clinic in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement, said Kelli Conlin, the executive director of
the New York State affiliate of Naral, is intended to spotlight
D'Amato's vote against the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic
Entrances Act, which Schumer sponsored. The measure made it a
Federal crime to attack or blockade an abortion clinic. Now, Ms.
Conlin said, it will have new resonance, and the organization is
considering buying more air time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredibly sincere and powerful and it would have been
regardless,'' she said. ``But sensitivities are so heightened from
the shooting in western New York that it's even more powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   David Eichenbaum, a Democratic political consultant who is not
working for anyone in this year's campaign, said abortion ``is no
longer the driving issue it once was, at least on the pro-choice
side.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Eichenbaum said: ``Sometimes an incident like this will do
more to energize those who are pro-choice who otherwise might not
consider that as an important an issue to go to the polls over. It
brings it home.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's aides would not comment about the political
ramifications of the slaying, and Schumer's aides would not talk
about whether they planned to refer to it in any advertisements, or
whether the candidate planned to use it on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Senator D'Amato and Chuck Schumer agree this was a
horrific crime and a horrible tragedy,'' said Josh Isay, Schumer's
campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   But, Isay added, ``it heightens the abortion issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Goldstein, the campaign spokesman for Spitzer, was less
reticent. ``Eliot is going to make a huge priority of this,''
Goldstein said. ``Stopping clinic violence is going to be a major
theme of our campaign from now to Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's debate against Vacco, Spitzer attacked him for
failing to enforce a court order in 1992 against anti-abortion
protesters who had blocked the entrance to a clinic. It was the
same clinic where Slepian worked.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge removed Vacco, then the U.S. attorney for
western New York, from the case. He was replaced with two special
prosecutors. Spitzer also criticized Vacco for dismantling the
Office of Reproductive Rights, which investigated threats and
crimes against abortion clinics, when he became attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Spitzer called for Vacco to revive that unit
immediately, vowing that he would do so on his first day in office
if elected.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, who said it was ``thoroughly, thoroughly possible''
that the issue would surface in Spitzer's advertisements, defended
the use of the issue by noting that the attorney general has direct
impact on the issue of clinic access.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco's campaign manager, Matt Behrmann, said in a statement
that Spitzer had ``sunk to a new and despicable low by attempting
to capitalize on the murder of a physician in order to garner
votes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that New York politics has never seen anything
as crass as Eliot Spitzer's willingness to exploit the unfortunate
murder of Slepian as a steppingstone for his own political
ambitions,'' Berhrmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Several consultants agreed that there might be political hay to
be made in Slepian's death but that it had to be done carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to score political points from a homicide can have a
backlash,'' said Maureen Connelly, a media consultant not working
for any candidate in next week's election.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NEIL HOHLFELD  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
LINCOLN, Neb. _ One of the most endearing traditions in college
football takes place after each Nebraska game at Memorial Stadium.
As the opponent leaves the field through the north end of the
stadium, Cornhuskers fans seated above the tunnel rise and give the
players an ovation.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's partially Midwestern courtesy but also a testament to the
fact Nebraska has won 47 straight home games. Fans tend to be more
gracious to a vanquished opponent than they would be toward a team
walking off the field with a road victory.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, the talk around Nebraska this season has been
whether the fans will continue the tradition when the Texas
Longhorns come to Memorial Stadium on Saturday. These teams are
hardly fierce rivals _ they have played only five times, and Texas
will make its first visit to Lincoln since 1959.
</P>
<P>
   For a number of reasons, the Nebraska fans _ and to some extent
the players _ have built up a huge dislike for the Longhorns. Most
obvious is Texas' 37-27 shocker over Nebraska in the initial Big 12
Championship Game in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers still had an outside shot at a national
championship that season, but Texas ruined it with the upset.
Nebraska cornerback Ralph Brown said he is looking forward to
exacting some revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game (in 1996) will make it a lot more special for the
whole team,'' Brown said. ``We haven't played them since then. They
crushed our hopes for a national championship, maybe, and a Big 12
championship for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going out and remembering what Texas did to us. It's
going to be kind of a rallying cry for everybody who played in that
game, and the guys who weren't here will be told about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers don't lose often _ they are 67-4 over the last
six seasons and have been ranked in the top 10 for 97 consecutive
weeks _ but the title-game upset by Texas is not the sole reason
for the hard feelings toward the Longhorns. It goes deeper than
that.
</P>
<P>
   Former Nebraska coach Tom Osborne laid the foundation for the
ill will when he complained about recruiting rules that were being
championed by Texas when the Longhorns and three other teams from
the Southwest Conference merged with the Big Eight in 1996. The Big
12 adopted the SWC rules concerning the number of academic non- and
partial qualifiers a team could recruit, and Osborne and others in
the Big Eight were not pleased.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Osborne and others in the Big Eight were unhappy
when SWC commissioner Steve Hatchell was named the first Big 12
commissioner rather than Kansas athletic director Bob Frederick. It
didn't help matters when the Big 12's headquarters were placed in
Dallas rather than Kansas City, Mo., the longtime home of the Big
Eight.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne implied that he felt UT was calling all the shots in the
new conference, an opinion picked up by the legion of loyal
Nebraska fans. Since this will be Texas' first game at Memorial
Stadium as a member of the Big 12, the reception for the 'Horns
could be interesting.
</P>
<P>
   All that aside, the game has strong implications for both teams.
Nebraska (7-1 overall, 3-1 Big 12) has rebounded after its 28-21
loss at Texas A&AMP;M on Oct. 10 with wins over Kansas and Missouri.
The Cornhuskers are pointing toward a showdown against Kansas State
on Nov. 14 that likely will determine the Big 12 North champion.
</P>
<P>
   Texas (5-2, 3-1) is one game behind the Aggies in the South
Division. A strong showing by running back Ricky Williams against
Nebraska would not only enhance his Heisman Trophy chances but also
give the Longhorns another block of evidence that their program is
on the way back under first-year coach Mack Brown.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, a case could have been made for Williams
running wild against Nebraska. After no player had a 100-yard
rushing game against Nebraska all of last season, Oklahoma State's
Nathan Simmons (114 yards) and Texas A&AMP;M's Dante Hall (113) and
Ja'Mar Toombs (110) did it in a two-game span in early October.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers pride themselves on stopping the running game.
They finished in the top five nationally in rushing defense in each
of the last four seasons, and last year's average of 73.4 yards
allowed per game ranked third in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   However, Nebraska's first three Big 12 opponents rushed for an
average of 177.6 yards, with A&AMP;M gaining a season-high 259.
Suddenly, it seemed the way to beat Nebraska was on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all goes back to guys being in the right gaps at the right
time,'' said Nebraska defensive end Chad Kelsay. ``When you have a
guy get out of position, that's when you start giving up the five-,
six-, seven- and eight-yard runs. We have to work hard at making
sure that everybody keeps their responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   In their 20-13 win over Missouri on Saturday, the Cornhuskers
continued to revert to form on defense. Devin West, who entered the
game as the No. 2 back in the nation behind Williams with a
175-yard average for Missouri, was held to 72 yards on 24 carries.
In one sequence, Nebraska kept West out of the end zone three
straight times from the one-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The week before, Nebraska shut out Kansas and held the Jayhawks
to 99 yards rushing. This past Saturday, Kansas running back David
Winbush alone shredded Colorado's defense for 268 yards on 29
carries.
</P>
<P>
   In their tuneup for the showdown with Williams, Nebraska held
Missouri to season lows in first downs, rushing yardage, total
yardage and points. They shut down West and quarterback Corby Jones
and limited the Tigers to 79 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That team (Missouri) is known for rushing, and we held them to
almost the absolute minimum you can hold them to,'' said defensive
end Mike Rucker. ``Our defense is definitely moving in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with Williams and his 212-yard average up next, the
Cornhuskers know they'll have to stop the run again this week to
avenge their 1996 loss to the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew West was the real deal,'' said defensive tackle Loran
Kaiser. ``Now, we have Ricky Williams. I think facing those two
guys serves to really motivate us.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm sure teams are going to keep trying to run it at us.
They'll watch the Oklahoma State tape, and they'll watch the Texas
A&AMP;M tape, and they'll see that people have been able to run a few
plays up the middle on us. But we've been working hard in practice,
and we've been correcting a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Though their run defense seemingly is back in order, the
Cornhuskers will meet the ultimate test this week in Williams. The
sportsmanship of their fans _ another tradition in Lincoln _ also
will be tested.

TELIGENT BEGINS FORAY IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alex Mandl, who resigned as president of AT&AMP;T in 1996, has kept
a low profile recently. Ever since his new company, Teligent, went
public last fall, he has kept his head down _ quietly securing
additional financing, building networks and constructing a sales
force.
</P>
<P>
   Mandl hopes to make his triumphant return to the forefront of
the telecommunications industry today as Teligent announces that it
is open for business in 10 of the nation's largest markets,
including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other companies, Teligent hopes to woo business
customers away from phone companies with an integrated bundle of
local, long-distance and data communications services.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike most new communications carriers, Teligent plans to
use wireless technology to transmit digital data at high speeds.
Using advanced, foot-wide antennae, Teligent hopes to offer clients
savings of up to 30 percent under the rates charged by older
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Teligent, based in Vienna, Va., has had minuscule revenue _ $3.3
million last year. But as the former heir apparent at AT&AMP;T, Mandl,
Teligent's chairman, has had the credibility on Wall Street to line
up major financing, with about $1.4 billion available. That is
enough to finance the company through the year 2000, Mandl said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   So as many small telecommunications stocks suffer after concern
over financing, Teligent's shares have held up well, closing on
Monday at $29.875, up $1.0625, in Nasdaq trading. That is
relatively close to its high of $35.375 in February and above its
initial offering price of $21.50.
</P>
<P>
   (Last week, Winstar Communications, another new wireless company
that is Teligent's archrival, secured $2 billion in financing from
Lucent Technologies.)

CONTEMPLATING AN `ESPN NEW YORK' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will Cablevision Systems' newly revealed distaste for creating
``overflow'' channels when two or more teams play games on Fox
Sports New York or the MSG Network provide ESPN with the impetus to
start a local cable sports channel?
</P>
<P>
   Although ESPN views itself as primarily a purveyor of national
sports programming, it has tried to enter the regional sports
market now dominated by Cablevision, Fox Sports and Liberty
Networks through the Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, ESPN in August scotched its plan to create ESPN
West to carry Anaheim Mighty Ducks and Angels games, and signed
10-year deals to let Fox Sports West's two outlets continue to
carry the teams. Also, ESPN was beaten to Detroit by the rapid
deployment of Fox Sports Detroit in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always interested in the regional sports business,''
said Steve Bornstein, president of ESPN and ABC Sports. ``It's a
business that complements ESPN's national services. We're a player,
but we haven't found the areas where it makes sense for us to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is an exciting market, but we haven't had those
discussions yet. We'd look at it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision's new no-overflow strategy _ which has led FSNY not
to televise four Islanders games and will cause viewers to miss
Saturday's Devils game _ proves that it has amassed too many teams
but not enough time to show them.
</P>
<P>
   Or it might be the laboratory of a team-by-team, pay-per-view
future.
</P>
<P>
   Before starting ESPN New York, ESPN would have to feel certain
of the possibility of buying the Yankees' cable rights when the
team's $486 million deal with MSG expires after the 2000 season.
ESPN's entrance into the bidding would create competition, much as
MSG, FSNY (then SportsChannel New York) and Channel 11 _ all true
competitors then _ vied for the existing deal.
</P>
<P>
   An ESPN New York bid could force George Steinbrenner, the
Yankees' principal owner, to rethink selling the team to
Cablevision, or induce Cablevision to raise its offer for the team,
rather than risk losing six months of highly rated baseball games.
Buying the team might also be a defensive strategy against any
local plans by ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN could find the Yankees as indispensable as Cablevision
does, as the crucial foundation programming of ESPN New York. (But
buying the Yankees is impossible since ESPN's parent, Walt Disney
Co., owns the Angels.)
</P>
<P>
   When ESPN wants something, it will pay a lot. Witness the
five-year, $600 million deal Disney recently struck to carry
National Hockey League games nationally on ABC and to continue to
televise them on ESPN and ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   If a proposed ESPN New York snared the Yankees, it could pursue
the Nets' rights, which FSNY owns through the 2001-02 season. With
the Yankees and the Nets as a foundation, ESPN New York could buy
college and and high-school packages, and fill time with ESPNews,
which has few local outlets. Then, looking ahead, FSNY's Devils'
rights are available after the 2006-07 season.
</P>
<P>
   MSG's Knicks and Rangers rights will never be available because
Cablevision owns the teams. FSNY's Mets and Islanders deals last
through 2016 and 2030, respectively. Still, two or three teams
would make ESPN New York viable.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with competition _ and the loss of teams _ Cablevision
would be less likely to scuttle games that it deems uneconomical to
carry. Strong competition shakes up entities like Cablevision,
which has a stranglehold on New York sports, carrying the Yankees,
Knicks and Rangers on MSG and the Mets, Devils, Islanders and Nets
on FSNY. It also sold the Yankees' local broadcast rights to
Channel 5, and is trying to sell the Mets' rights to Channel 9 or
11.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic Redux
</P>
<P>
   Being named co-chairman of the NBC Olympics division fills a
void for Dennis Swanson, president of Channel 4. As the president
of ABC Sports, he was frustrated that Capital Cities, ABC's owner
then, would not let him bid enough to buy the rights to the 1992
and 1996 Summer Olympics and the 1992 Winter Games. ``There was a
reticence to lay down huge sums of money on single-event
programming,'' said Swanson, who will focus on the cable side of
NBC's Olympic cable telecasts on CNBC and MSNBC. He will stay at
Channel 4, while sharing responsibilities for the next five
Olympics with Dick Ebersol.
</P>
<P>
   Airwaves
</P>
<P>
   Let's get this straight _ a network sideline reporter like CBS'
Armen Keteyian is barred from interviewing players and coaches
during games, like Sunday's Jacksonville-Denver contest, but he can
engage in silly chitchat with the star of a new CBS comedy like Ted
Danson? That's the rule, says the National Football League, as long
as game action is not shown. If only there were a rule to enforce
good sense ... Why was the announcement of the first Bowl
Championship Series standings _ the first official peek at the top
college contenders to play in the national championship game _ held
until halftime of ``Monday Night Football?'' ABC is paying $500
million over seven years for the bowl games, so you wouldn't expect
ABC to distribute the first standings via news release, rather than
via Chris Berman, would you? In ensuing weeks, the standing will
come out on Monday afternoons ... After initially seeming
uninterested, HBO has renewed ``Arliss'' for a fourth season.

JOHN DALY, EAR, NOSE AND THROAT SPECIALIST, DEAD AT 86 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. John Francis Daly, an ear, nose and throat specialist who
contributed to the development of modern head and neck surgery
while associated with New York University Medical School and many
other regional institutions, died last Wednesday at Holy Name
Hospital in Teaneck, N.J. A former resident of Tenafly, he was 86
and lived in Fort Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Daly began in head and neck surgery early, when it branched off
as a separate medical specialty. He wrote extensively on the
subject and as a teacher and practicing surgeon helped develop new
techniques for use in the operating room.
</P>
<P>
   He was director of otolaryngology, which deals with disorders of
the ear, nose and throat, at both Bellevue Hospital Center and NYU
Medical Center from the late 1940s to 1980. At the university, he
was a professor and chairman of the Department of Otolaryngology
from 1949 until his retirement in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Daly was born in Jersey City, and graduated from Fordham
University in 1933. He received his medical degree from what is now
Downstate Medical Center of the State University of New York. He
completed his training at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat
Hospital and Harvard University and served in the Army Air Force in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He was a former president of the American Society for Head and
Neck Surgery, the American Laryngological Association and the
American Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology, and chairman
of the American Medical Association's section on otolaryngology.
</P>
<P>
   Daly is survived by his wife of 57 years, Annette O'Mealia Daly;
a daughter, Sharon Ann Butler of Hillsdale, N.J., three grandsons
and a great-granddaughter.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: MASTER TEACHERS WHOSE ARTISTRY GLOWS IN
PRIVATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (lb) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When holding forth on almost any subject, George Bernard Shaw
usually got to the truth of the matter with blunt, unsentimental
brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   But the most unfair thing he ever said, in his ``Maxims of a
Revolutionist,'' was: ``He who can, does; he who can't, teaches.''
</P>
<P>
   True, there are plenty of bad teachers. But many bad teachers
are quite good at what they teach. They just can't teach.
Conversely, there are some extraordinarily good teachers who are
not entirely comfortable doing what they teach, but know how to
teach it.
</P>
<P>
   Think of Tatyana Tarasova, the coach of the young Russian
figure-skating sensation Ilya Kulik, who won the gold medal at the
Winter Olympics in February. Kulik may be the most talented male
figure skater ever. His unlikely coach, though a former skater, is
a chunky, middle-aged, tear-prone woman with big hair and a thick
fur coat who wraps the apple-cheeked heartthrob in her maternal
arms after each routine.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Ms. Tarasova doesn't get on the ice and demonstrate the
way to nail a quadruple jump. What she provides Kulik with is
expert analysis of his every move, precise instructions,
choreographic tips and essential psychological support.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there are also great teachers who do what they teach
very well indeed. But they may not be able to do it in quite the
sustained way that professionals who don't teach can. Among the
best examples are music teachers who thrive in the cloistered
atmosphere of a conservatory or university, superior musicians who
are not cut out for the grind and pace of a professional solo
career but who can play superbly.
</P>
<P>
   A certain quality of athleticism is essential to a touring
musician, and not just for hot young virtuosos who can vanquish the
arm-blurring octave passages of the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto.
Even a refined pianist like Claudio Arrau had an athletic kind of
stamina that enabled him to maintain his high standards despite a
performing schedule that would defeat most university-based
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   There are many master teachers who are revered by young
musicians as performers yet who seldom stray from the environs of a
conservatory or college campus. There, it is the process of working
that sustains them, like a monk's daily ritual of chanting and
prayer. And, to them, passing on the practice to younger musicians
is a sacred and self-empowering trust.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these teachers, though renowned within musical circles,
have low profiles among the larger concertgoing public. For
example, the pianist Howard Karp, a longtime faculty member at the
University of Wisconsin in Madison, is an elegant musician, a
Romantic by nature whose performances are spacious, imaginative and
technically exquisite.
</P>
<P>
   There is the cellist George Neikrug at Boston University, a bold
musician and excellent instrumentalist who has guided a few
generations of students into professional careers. Among cellists,
Neikrug is enormously respected. But how many people outside that
small sphere know of him?
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lately, the teacher I'm thinking about in particular is Donald
Currier, professor emeritus at Yale University, who recently turned
80 and is grappling right now with cancer, with encouraging results
so far.
</P>
<P>
   Currier is a pianist of exceptional refinement and musical
understanding. He, too, is respected among musicians and revered by
the students he taught during a 38-year career at Yale. I was one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   By nature he is a buttoned-down New Englander. Often, when I
arrived at his studio for a lesson, he would seem distracted, even
sullen. But once I started playing, he grew animated and
infectiously involved. I remember the day that this rather
inhibited man started dancing around the room to illustrate the
sprightly gait of a movement from Schumann's ``Carnaval.''
</P>
<P>
   Currier has done some memorably beautiful playing. There was a
remarkable performance of Ravel's ``Gaspard de la Nuit,'' which he
played not as a display of daunting technical difficulty, too often
its fate, but as a wildly rhapsodic, musically sophisticated work.
</P>
<P>
   The way he restrained the shimmering ``Ondine'' movement, the
hypnotic steadiness he brought to the obsessive, softly repeated
octave motive in the ``Gibet'' movement and the surging energy he
summoned in the final ``Scarbo'' movement transfixed an audience
one evening at the university's Sprague Recital Hall. But who heard
it, or even heard about it outside that small hall?
</P>
<P>
   There were other performing highlights of his Yale career: a
lyrically wistful account of Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 2 with the
Yale School of Music Orchestra, a Schumann recital capped by a
triumphant performance of the Symphonic Etudes and, with some
student players and faculty colleagues, an exhilarating performance
of Hummel's Piano Septet, virtually a concerto for piano and six
instruments, a work that helped Liszt conquer Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But to give such performances, Currier, like other college-based
musicians, needed time to work steadily, with peace of mind and a
supportive environment. He never had the kind of facility and
endurance that allow a pianist like Emanuel Ax to play so often and
still so well.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to suggest that Ax's stamina is some mere athletic
prowess. Prodigious facility is not incompatible with musical
depth, and interpretive insight is not the sole province of
musicians who ruminate in conservatories.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as a teacher Currier knows how important it is for a
young musician to develop a capacity to learn music quickly. A lot
of work will come to someone who can substitute on short notice for
an ailing accompanist, or learn a composer's new chamber piece in a
few days.
</P>
<P>
   Currier liked to brag a bit about one student who showed up at a
lesson having learned Chopin's First Ballade in a week, and played
it not badly at all. ``How about learning No. 2 for next week?''
Currier asked. The student did. Then, with some more prodding, he
learned No. 3 and No. 4 over the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, helping students to work steadily on an important recital
program, sometimes for an entire academic year, is standard
practice and an important discipline for teachers consecrated to
the art of music. After all, a pianist learning Schumann's
``Carnaval'' or Elliott Carter's Piano Sonata is never really
finished. Ideally, each reworking and performance should gain in
musical insight and pianistic assurance.
</P>
<P>
   Much exceptional performing is being done by teachers in safe
small halls on campuses sometimes far way from major urban musical
centers. More power to them and, especially, to Donald Currier.

JOHN DIDCOTT, 67, SOUTH AFRICAN LAWYER AND JUDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Didcott, a South African judge known for his firm support
of human rights during 23 years on the bench in and after the
apartheid era, died Oct. 20 at his home in Durban, South Africa. He
was 67.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was leukemia, said his wife, Pam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farewell, Grand Master of Justice'' was the headline in
Sunday's issue of The Sunday Times, a national South African weekly
newspaper, which said: ``Judge Didcott became a human rights
legend. During the worst years of apartheid, his scathing attacks
on the unjust policies of the government'' of that day ``were pored
over with delight by opponents of those policies.''
</P>
<P>
   At his death Didcott was a member of his country's 4-year-old
Constitutional Court. He was named to it by the post-apartheid
government in 1994, when the court was established as part of the
post-apartheid legal system that was set out in the interim
Constitution of 1993. He was on sick leave and sat on the court for
only a few weeks this year, his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   During the apartheid era, Didcott was a judge on the Supreme
Court of Natal, a province in east South Africa that includes
Durban.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Jack Greenberg of Columbia Law School, an authority on
civil-rights law, said Monday: ``Under apartheid, South Africa had
a peculiar legal system in that there was a small handful of
judges, maybe six or eight in the whole country, who interpreted
the law in a humane fashion and whenever possible made an effort to
interpret it so that it was not discriminatory or harsh toward the
black population. Didcott was one of that small number of judges.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, an old friend of the judge, recalled him in those
days: ``He was the one judge who never sentenced anybody to death.
When I asked him how he could maintain that record, he said he
always found a reason. I said, `What if you weren't able to find a
reason?' and he said, `Then I'd resign.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he was selected for the Constitutional Court,
having been a judge under apartheid,'' Greenberg said, indicates
that the African National Congress, which is now South Africa's
ruling party, and Nelson Mandela, the post-apartheid president,
``recognized him as a beneficent and humane judge who did all he
could do under the circumstances'' during apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitutional Court is South Africa's highest court, and
its jurisdiction is limited to constitutional cases, roughly the
same role as the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   While Didcott was on the Natal court he concluded that
defendants in south African courts were entitled to counsel _ which
they had not been under the apartheid system. Then, after
apartheid's downfall, his view concerning right to counsel was
vindicated when it was incorporated into the interim Constitution
and into South Africa's permanent Constitution, which is now in
force.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   John Mowbray Didcott was born in Durban. He received a
bachelor's degree in 1951 and his law degree in 1953, both from the
University of Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   He was president of the National Union of South African Students
in 1955 and 1956 and became a much-sought-after commercial lawyer
in Durban before he was invited to become a judge in 1975. He was a
visiting scholar at Columbia for a year in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife of 40 years, the former Pam Brokensha, his
survivors include two daughters, Sally Goldman of Durban and Corin
Didcott of Johannesburg; four grandchildren, and his mother, Flo
Didcott of Durban.

SUN MICROSYSTEMS INTRODUCING A NEW VERSION OF UNIX
</HEADLINE>
   (ll) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sun Microsystems plans to unveil a new version
of its Solaris operating system Tuesday in an effort to capitalize
on Microsoft's delays on its newest version of its NT operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   The new Solaris program, which is Sun's version of the Unix
operating system for its Sparc-based systems and Intel-based
servers, has gained increasing market share in the Unix world in
the last year largely based on the growth of the Internet server
and enterprise computing market.
</P>
<P>
   A number of companies are competing for the rapidly growing
high-end corporate computing market, including I.B.M., Hewlett
Packard and Compaq Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is also trying to enter the high-end market with a new
version of its Windows NT operating system. But Microsoft has been
delayed by more than a year and there are industry reports that the
system continues to have problems.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several analysts said an announcement by I.B.M. on
Monday that it planned to join forces with Sequent Computer and the
Santa Cruz Operation, a Unix software company, indicateed that the
market was moving back toward Unix because of Microsoft's delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the Microsoft marketing machine has made NT a
contender,'' said Andrew Allison, an industry analyst, ``but nobody
in their right mind would use NT for critical applications at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun executives said they planned to name the newest version of
Solaris, which features 64-bit addressing and as a result can
handle vast data sets, Solaris 7.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that this is a significant jump in the company's
numbering scheme _ the last version was 2.6 _ Sun's officials
disputed the obvious marketing connotation of the number 7 with
respect to the next version of Microsoft's Windows NT, which is
scheduled to be 5.0.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Zander, president of Sun Microsystems, said, ``We believe we
have a three year lead on Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Most industry analysts contend that such a figure is optimistic.
Yet there is evidence that Sun is continuing to pick up market
share against all three of its closest Unix competitors for large
enterprise computer operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, Sun grew faster, at 37 percent, than all
other server vendors except Dell Computer. Sun passed
Hewlett-Packard in the second quarter to lead the industry in Unix
revenues for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Zander also said he believed that Microsoft would have
significant difficulties meeting stability goals necessary for
corporate use. The current version of NT is reported to have more
than 35 million lines of code, increasing the chances of software
errors that will plague developers.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the version of Solaris scheduled to begin shipping
on Tuesday will have between 12 million and 13 million lines of
code.
</P>
<P>
   Separately I.B.M., Sequent and the Santa Cruz Operation agreed
to develop a single software operating system that will control
computers running both Intel computer chips and I.B.M.'s own
non-Intel based microprocessors. In addition, the partners said a
variety of other computer makers will use the new Unix system in
their own machines, including Unisys, Groupe Bull, Thomson-CSF,
Acer and Fujitsu's ICL unit.

EDITORIAL: A SECOND TERM FOR PATAKI 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, Oct. 27: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When George Pataki delivered his first address to the state
legislature nearly four years ago, New Yorkers who had grown used
to the wide-ranging agenda and verbal pyrotechnics of Mario Cuomo
were startled by their new governor's pedestrian oratory and narrow
set of priorities. Now, almost four years later, we know there is
another difference. Pataki promised only a few things, but he has
done what he promised.
</P>
<P>
   We have disagreed with many of his priorities, particularly his
reinstitution of the death penalty. We also believe that the
governor's risky practice of enacting big tax cuts that grow in
size each year will not be sustainable if the economy sags. But we
have been impressed by his approach on other areas, and that has
tilted us toward Pataki over his worthy Democratic opponent, Peter
Vallone, the New York City Council Speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Since Pataki became governor, the state has become more
business-friendly, with targeted tax relief and eased regulations.
On the environment, which unexpectedly became one of Pataki's
signature issues, his administration has been aggressive in
expanding parks and state forests. He has been a forceful advocate
for stronger clean air standards. After a rough start in which he
attempted to cut welfare benefits and reduce payments to hospitals,
nursing homes and home health care services, Pataki accepted a less
punitive approach, preserving these vital services for the poor in
cooperation with the Democratic-controlled assembly. There is now
in place a system of vouchers for families that run out of benefits
after five years, for example.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to social issues, Pataki's brand of moderate
Republicanism has been a welcome change from the strident tone of
his party's national leadership. He supports gay rights and freedom
of choice on abortion. His quick and forthright condemnation of the
shooting of a doctor who performed abortions in western New York
was typical of his pro-choice credentials. We wish that he would do
more to persuade the Republican majority in the state senate to
adopt a similarly progressive and inclusive attitude.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1994 gubernatorial campaign, which was characterized
by a destructive city-versus-upstate tone, New York City had reason
to be concerned about how it would be treated under the Pataki
administration. The governor's first austerity budget proposal
seemed to reinforce those worries. But since then we have been
heartened by Pataki's work to make the state's formula for school
construction aid fairer to the city. He has also pledged to rectify
the imbalance in basic school aid that has robbed the city of its
just share of assistance. Pataki forced large increases in tuition
at the state university system, but he has also embarked on a major
expansion and offered some creative ideas for instilling local
control at its different campuses. We appreciate his part in
cleaning up the operation of the Javits Center, creating the new
Hudson River Park and forging the still-fragile agreements to
protect New York City's upstate watershed lands.
</P>
<P>
   Our endorsement is based on Pataki's progress on this limited
but critical agenda, particularly his work on the environment and
improving the business climate. But there is another set of
political issues where the record is troubling. These issues touch
on leadership style and also on the substance of government reform
and campaign finance. Pataki sometimes displays an almost
Reaganesque attitude to his job in which difficult problems are
ignored, dismissed or delegated to others. We appreciate the
political skill with which he follows this course, but we urge him
toward greater engagement in his second term.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has contended, as his predecessors did, that he could not
fix some of the state's problems because the state legislature is
irresponsible and undisciplined. That is true, but blaming is not
leading. The state's political system has broken down. The
legislative process has become a fight to secure the good will of
the big money donors. That will not change until New York's
regulations on campaign finance _ among the most lax in the nation
_ are reformed.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has done absolutely nothing about this problem, and he
has set an unwholesome example by raising almost half his campaign
treasury from individuals and companies with vested interests. He
says the present system is terrible and in the course of this
campaign called for systemic reform. Yet he admits he has no plan
for fixing things. Therefore this endorsement comes with a major
reservation about his financial record and a promise to pester him
relentlessly to become a force for legislative and campaign reform.
</P>
<P>
   We dwell on campaign money because there is no aspect of
Pataki's record that is more troubling or that represents a greater
threat to his national aspirations. As an article in today's Times
by Clifford Levy indicates, there have been far too many occasions
over the past few years in which a sudden big donation to the
Republican cause has been followed by a state contract. Pataki
seems to prefer not to know about any of this, just as he said he
had no idea who gave money for his last inauguration _ a list of
names his aides insisted on keeping secret. In a recent interview
with The New York Times, Pataki said he expected to stage a less
expensive inaugural. If re-elected, he ought to set up a
transparent inaugural committee that refuses large donations from
parties doing business with the state.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, the Democratic nominee, is an honorable public servant
who has had a solid record on campaign finance legislation. We
endorsed Vallone in the Democratic primary as the candidate who
might best be able to turn the gubernatorial race into a
competitive, issue-driven contest. That has not happened. Vallone
complains rightly that Pataki has dodged debating him, and Pataki's
attempt to throw up his hands and leave it to unnamed campaign
aides to work out a debate is pure evasion. But many of Vallone's
failings have been his own fault. His economic development program
is based almost entirely on a questionable plan for reallocating
state contracts to New York companies, an idea that can only work
on the margins and runs the risk of retaliation from other states.
Some of the other ideas Vallone has proposed are interesting, but
the candidate himself has failed to articulate them in a clear
manner.
</P>
<P>
   We believe that a majority of voters will conclude, as we have,
that absent a more compelling challenge than this campaign has
produced, Pataki's overall record has been solid enough to warrant
a second term. We applaud in particular his work in bringing the
new Hudson River Park on the West Side of Manhattan to reality. The
plain fact is that this park, so essential to the cityscape of the
future, would not exist without Pataki's work and his evenhanded
treatment of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   There is a danger that the lure of national office may drive
Pataki to the right, and to his original mode of balancing the
budget on the backs of the poor. But if he wants to distinguish
himself from the rest of the crowd of potential vice-presidential
candidates, he must do it by wiping away the dark spots on his
record and leading the state into an era of clean government and
politics free of special interest domination. Given the
intelligence and determination with which he has pursued the goals
he set for himself during his first term, we believe George Pataki
is capable of making these things happen, and we endorse him for
re-election.

FIREFIGHTER WHO RODE FLOAT IN BLACKFACE ARE DISMISSED 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two white firefighters who were suspended for wearing
blackface as they rode on a parade float in Queens on Labor Day
were dismissed from their jobs Monday, Fire Department officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-page decision, the fire commissioner, Thomas Von
Essen, said that he agreed with an administrative judge who found
that the firefighters, Robert Steiner and Jonathan Walters, both
29, had not testified ``credibly or truthfully'' in defending their
behavior at a departmental trial.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters had maintained that by participating in the
parade, they were mocking the predominantly white community of
Broad Channel, Queens, where they had grown up.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, the firefighters said they had not meant to
offend black people when they covered their faces in black
lipstick, donned Afro wigs and joined their friends in tossing
watermelons to spectators.
</P>
<P>
   But in his decision dismissing the firefighters, Von Essen said
the men brought ``reproach and discredit upon the Fire Department
and violated their oath of office.''
</P>
<P>
   Their behavior undermined ``the public's trust in the Fire
Department and the public's belief that they will receive
even-handed treatment from the department,'' the commissioner said
in his decision. The department's ``continuing and strenuous
efforts to diversify its work force by encouraging minority group
members to apply to the department'' could be severely hampered by
the actions of the firefighters, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Marvyn Kornberg, a lawyer for Steiner, said he would battle the
decision in the courts. He also said that prior to the trial, ``The
fire commissioner told us if it was up to him he wouldn't fire the
firefighters, but that he had been ordered by the mayor to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   After the incident, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had called publicly
for the ouster of the firefighters, as well as for the dismissal of
a New York City police officer who also rode on the float. The
police officer, Joseph Locurto, 30, was dismissed earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically,'' Kornberg said, ``the commissioner had two
choices: either fire the firefighters or have the mayor fire him.
Which one do you think he would opt for?''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Regan, a Fire Department spokesman, said that Von Essen
had never spoken to Kornberg about the mayor's position. ``The
commissioner's decision speaks for itself,'' he said, ``as do the
actions of the firefighters.''
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg said he and lawyers for Walters and Locurto have filed
suit against the city in Federal District Court in Manhattan,
charging that city officials violated their clients' First
Amendment rights by disciplining them for their actions off the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only one who is allowed to exercise their First Amendment
rights unscathed is the mayor,'' Kornberg said. ``When he led a
racially discriminatory march on city hall when David Dinkins was
mayor, it never prevented him from holding the job as mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg was referring to a 1992 demonstration against former
Mayor Dinkins by off-duty police officers. Giuliani was present at
the event, which turned into a melee involving thousands of people.

 Cal Fed's Chief Bears Down in His Latest Venture  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The man known as one of the savviest dealmakers in banking has had
a rocky time lately with his California savings and loan venture.
<P>
   In the eight months since Texas banker Gerald J. Ford agreed to
buy Glendale's Golden State Bancorp, the thrift's stock has plunged
44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's quite a comedown for a man whose 23-year run buying and
selling financial institutions took him from a one-branch West
Texas bank to the chief executive job at the nation's
second-largest thrift and a personal fortune of more than half a
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a world-class roper and brander of banks and thrifts,''
said Jefferies &AMP; Co. analyst Charlotte Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   Ford owns about 16 million shares, or roughly 12 percent of
Golden State, the parent company of the merged Glendale/ California
Federal Bank. The stock's tumble has personally cost him more than
$200 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating to me, and I don't understand it,'' Ford said
during an interview in his San Francisco office.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State's falling stock signals that Ford may not sell the
thrift quickly, as he's suggested in the past.
</P>
<P>
   With the stock down and the economic climate tough for thrifts,
Ford may hold on to Golden State far longer than analysts expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not anticipate a change of ownership in this cycle,''
Ford noted. ``I feel like it's the Army and we've re-upped for five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden State's stock fell largely because investors bailed out
of the savings and loan industry, since thrift profits are squeezed
when interest rates fall.
</P>
<P>
   But Golden State fell harder than its peers. Analysts say
investors are wary of Ford's business partner, New York financier
Ronald Perelman, who owns roughly 30 percent of the thrift's
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, the country banker from Texas, and Perelman, the
flamboyant corporate raider, seem unlikely partners. They joined
forces in 1988 when Perelman wanted to buy busted Texas S&AMP;Ls from
the federal government and needed a local banker to run his
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Perelman has a reputation as a sharpie who lands on his feet
while other investors are left holding the bag. At Marvel
Entertainment, shareholders accused him of shifting losses onto
their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golden State investors wondered, is he going to stick it to
them too?'' said Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   To Ford, the plunge in Golden State's stock makes no sense.
</P>
<P>
   Criticisms of Perelman are ``totally unfair,'' he said. The New
York tycoon and his lieutenants ``have been great business
associates.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal Fed's staple product is the adjustable-rate mortgage. But
when interest rates are low, consumers shift to fixed-rate
mortgages to lock in cheap rates. That makes it hard for Cal Fed to
add profitable mortgages to its portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Golden State's profits aren't likely to fall as much as
investors anticipate, Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   He's buying low-risk securities to make up for any shortfalls in
mortgage lending. And he's trying to make sure he doesn't make bad
loans that will haunt the thrift if the economy turns down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business is the most challenging we've faced in years,''
Ford said. ``We're in a batten-down-the-hatches mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   To run the bank day-to-day, Ford relies on the thrift's
president, Carl Webb, who's been with him since his Texas banking
days.
</P>
<P>
   Ford came to California in 1994 when he and Perelman bought
loss-plagued First Nationwide Bank. He brought the thrift back into
the black and then acquired Los Angeles' California Federal Bank,
adopting its name.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Ford shifted his sights to Golden State, then
corporate parent of Glendale Federal Bank, a feisty thrift best
known for its David-versus-Goliath ad campaign against Wells Fargo
Bank. The takeover took effect September 11.
</P>
<P>
   Buying Golden State gave Ford a publicly traded stock. That
makes it easier for Ford to buy other thrifts or sell Golden State,
since transactions often take the form of exchanges of stock.
</P>
<P>
   After absorbing Glendale Federal, Cal Fed has $52 billion in
assets and more than 350 branches, &UR;  &LR; all but a handful in
California.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the 54-year-old Ford has morphed from country banker
to corporate statesman. He flies in his personal jet from his
Dallas home to Cal Fed's San Francisco headquarters and the
Manhattan townhouse Perelman uses as his base of operations.
</P>
<P>
   A native of the Texas Panhandle town of Pampa, Ford has come a
long way from the days when discounter Southwest Airlines hauled
him each week from Dallas to Lubbock, the commercial airport
nearest his one-branch bank in the dusty West Texas town of Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flew Southwest 125 times a year and put on 60,000 to 70,000
miles on my car,'' Ford recalled. ``But I was just thrilled to have
my own business to run.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ford, the bargaining table is more than work _ it's the most
satisfying thing he does.
</P>
<P>
   Deals are ``like hitting a home run or scoring a touchdown,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was attorney for a group of privately held companies when a
business associate persuaded him to buy a bank in the mid-1970s. He
signed on two partners who put up a little over $800,000, borrowed
$400,000 for his personal share, and was on his way.
</P>
<P>
   The freshly minted bank president wasn't inclined to settle into
the comfortable role of a country banker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good old boy, but he had a zeal about him you don't
see much in a small-town banker,'' recalled Gayle Earls, a rival
banker and friend.
</P>
<P>
   Using more borrowed money, Ford built his one-bank investment
into a sprawling two-state network that he sold in 1994 for $495
million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ford and Perelman sold their Texas thrift in 1993,
multiplying their original investment fivefold.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said his success was due to ``leverage and luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have seen him in action say luck has little to do with
it. He's a disciplined negotiator, they note, whose hard-nosed core
is wrapped in layers of charm.
</P>
<P>
   Said Edward Harshfield, chief executive of the old Cal Fed when
Ford bought it: ``He is this Southern gentleman, but he knows what
he wants and what he's willing to pay for it.''

 Net Startup Jumping Into Health Care  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Undeterred by Healtheon Corp.'s ailing initial public offering, a
new Internet startup is getting into the health care business.
<P>
   ChannelPoint Inc. announced its plans yesterday, pinning its
hopes on software that can automate the computer systems of
insurance companies so they can update records and health plans
instantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It usually takes a consumer four to eight weeks to enroll in a
program and get their ID card,'' ChannelPoint CEO Ken Hollen said.
``Our software, when used by a health care provider, reduces that
process time to a matter of days.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2-year-old company added that United HealthCare, one of the
world's largest health management companies, with 13 million
members, has signed up to use its Insure software program.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Springs, Colo., company has enlisted a cadre of
former Sun engineers to develop the complex Java-based application.
In the past year, its staff has doubled, to 120, and it expects to
ring up $20 million in sales next year. If all goes well, the
company could go public next year.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists evidently like what they see: ChannelPoint
has raised $38.5 million in three rounds of financing from the
likes of Mohr Davidow, Capital Z Partners and Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken a fundamentally different approach,'' Hollen
said. ``We started the company, got the application up and running,
and then announced it.''
</P>
<P>
   The thinly veiled poke is at Healtheon, a competing online
health service that scotched an IPO last week after months of hype.
As late as October 1, company officials had boasted the public
offering would value Healtheon at about $430.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clara company, which is headed by Netscape and Silicon
Graphics co-founder Jim Clark, makes software that lets consumers
manage their health care benefits and medical transactions online.
Healtheon has enlisted a long list of health care providers,
hospitals, doctors and pharmacies to adopt the system.
</P>
<P>
   But Healtheon was one of a slew of Net-related IPOs that was
scared off by global turmoil and shaky market conditions. As soon
as Healtheon's $51 million offering went belly up, Theglobe.com, a
Web community with more than 1.9 million subscribers, and Computer
Literacy, an e-commerce business, scrapped or postponed theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, several startups are overlooking Healtheon's IPO
decision in hopes of cashing in on the $1 trillion health care
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sunnyvale's HealthInsurance.com ( &LR; www.ehealthinsurance.com &LR; )
last week debuted a Web site that lets online users research and
buy health insurance over the Internet. It also enables consumers
to obtain free rate quotes and electronic enrollment applications.

 L.A. Judge's Ruling Is Digital Music to Diamond Multimedia's Ears  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
There will be digital music in the streets as a result of a federal
judge's decision yesterday in Los Angeles.
<P>
   Judge Audrey Collins threw out a lawsuit by the Recording
Industries Association of America, which had tried to prevent
Diamond Multimedia of San Jose from selling a portable device that
plays digital music.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond's Rio device is like a digital Walkman that stores music
on chips instead of tapes. Users hook the Rio up to their computer
and download music from the Internet or from a music CD that has
been copied onto the computer's hard drive. People listen by using
headphones.
</P>
<P>
   What bothered the RIAA _ which represents the companies that own
music copyrights _ is that the Rio downloads music in a format
called MP3, which has no protections against unauthorized copying.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 makes it easy to digitize and compress music so that it can
be sent over the Internet. RIAA feared that if the $200 Rio, and
similar devices, become popular, more people will illegally steal
music and distribute it via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With this in mind, the RIAA recently filed suit against Diamond,
asking Collins to halt shipments of the Rio, which is scheduled to
hit the stores in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday, Collins rejected the RIAA's request for a
preliminary injunction and said Diamond could ship the Rio.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Wirt, Diamond's vice president of marketing, cheered the
ruling and said it will spur a new type of music delivery that
enables small artists to bypass the major record labels and sell
directly to consumers over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Cary Sherman, chief counsel to the RIAA, was disappointed that
he lost the battle to stop the Rio from shipping. But he said RIAA
hasn't conceded defeat in the war to force Diamond to pay royalties
into a special fund meant to compensate artists for the fact that
people copy their works
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a preliminary-injunction ruling, nothing about it is
final,'' said Sherman, adding that the RIAA may ask for a quick
trial to decide whether Diamond must pay a royalty on every Rio it
sells.
</P>
<P>
   LOBBY POWER: Cisco Systems, a power in the networking industry,
is flexing its muscles in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco-ites want the world to know that their company persuaded
the White House to ease some export controls on the sale of
encryption systems.
</P>
<P>
   Encryption _ the sending and receiving of coded messages _ has
provoked a three-way fight between the Clinton administration,
high-tech firms and civil libertarians.
</P>
<P>
   The White House wants to limit the export of powerful encryption
software until the Federal Bureau of Investigation gets the keys
that would let it decode any secret message involved in a federal
crime. Civil libertarians oppose giving keys to Big Brother.
</P>
<P>
   Industry has vacillated between these extremes, arguing that
export controls on U.S. gear make no sense so long as foreign firms
are selling strong crypto systems.
</P>
<P>
   So last week, Cisco was ecstatic when the White House agreed to
its proposal, which will have the effect of allowing several
networking firms, including some Cisco competitors, to export their
strongest encryption to companies in 40 countries deemed friendly
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, each such sale would have required a separate export
license. But Cisco, with help from other network industry firms,
convinced the administration that the FBI doesn't need the keys to
decode messages sent over corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple. Corporate network servers decode incoming
messages and send them to the recipient in plain text.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for FBI agents to tap the voice or e-mail of a suspect at
a U.S. firm, all they need is a federal search warrant ordering the
company to turn over the person's communications  &LR; after &LR;  they have
been decoded.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco called this idea the private doorbell, because law
enforcement authorities can ring the doorbell at companies and ask
for permission to tap its network.
</P>
<P>
   Although this is a limited win that only affects encryption
systems for corporate networks, Cisco is still pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to separate out the religious issues and focus on the
technology,'' said Cisco general counsel Dan Scheinman.
</P>
<P>
   Scheinman approached White House Deputy Chief of Staff John
Podesta with the private-doorbell idea in February. Cisco
export-control maven Elizabeth Kaufman helped line up support from
other network firms like Ascend Communications, Novell, 3Com and
Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   This group effort paid off last week when the administration
gave the largest networking firms what amounts to a blanket license
to export their strongest encryption systems to companies in
friendly countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is worth billions in exports,'' Scheinman said.
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties groups are, at best, lukewarm about Cisco's
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of ambiguities about who rings the doorbell,
showing what kind of warrant, and who's supposed to answer,'' said
Jerry Berman with the Center for Democracy &AMP; Technology in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Steinhardt, president of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation in San Francisco, said that for encryption to mean
anything, it has to protect all communications all the time, right
down to the end-user's hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of this does anything to give average users access to
strong encryption,'' Steinhardt said.

 Pac Bell May Charge More Users for Directory  &HT;       
 By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pacific Bell is shaking up the telephone directory business and the
result could be higher costs for users of yellow pages.
<P>
   The phone company has notified regulators it may split many of
its one-volume telephone directories into separate white-page and
yellow-page books _ and charge purchasers whatever it wants for
yellow pages.
</P>
<P>
   The move could result in a fivefold price increase for people
who live in one area but buy directories for adjacent areas.
</P>
<P>
   The tariff change _ which faces stiff opposition from consumer
advocates _ could be especially expensive since area code splits
mean many people must consult several directories to cover the
places they live, work, shop and play.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would affect the vast majority of area codes in
California that still are served by single directories containing
all local listings.
</P>
<P>
   It would not affect the nine metropolitan areas served by
Pacific Bell that already have separate white- and yellow-page
directories with unregulated rates for yellow pages.
</P>
<P>
   Under the existing rules, residents of Marin County, for
example, get a single book with classified advertising listings
(``yellow pages'') and alphabetical listings (``white pages'') each
year. They'd continue to get that information for free.
</P>
<P>
   But it might be broken into two books in the future and repriced
for outsiders. White pages, as a regulated enterprise, still would
be available for $10.30, but unregulated yellow pages could be
priced at whatever the market will bear, held in check only by
competition from the producers of rival yellow pages.
</P>
<P>
   However, yellow page competitors say they've only garnered 10
percent of the market controlled by Pac Bell. ``There are many
areas where there's no competition to Pacific Bell, at all,'' said
Sieg Fischer, president of Valley Yellow Pages in Fresno.
</P>
<P>
   If the experience of many cities is any guide, there may be big
price spikes ahead if the request is approved. In Oakland, where
yellow and white pages already are printed separately, for example,
outsiders pay a regulated rate of $7 for white pages but $35 for
yellow pages. In San Francisco, it's $7.60 for white pages and $43
for yellow pages. In San Jose, white pages are $7.75 and yellow
pages cost $42.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers say it's most likely that smaller counties
with smaller populations will continue to be served by single,
combined directories. But fast-growing counties near major
population centers _ counties like Contra Costa, Sonoma, Napa,
Marin and the like _ would be prime candidates for book splitting.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates said they not only oppose book splitting, but
they oppose the way approval is being sought. The phone company
isn't seeking regulatory approval through the traditional means of
a rate case.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it quietly made an ``advice letter'' filing on October
2 that nearly went unnoticed, since such filings are intended for
routine, noncontroversial administrative matters. Without
challenge, such filings automatically take effect.
</P>
<P>
   Both the PUC's Office of Ratepayer Advocates and the nonprofit
consumer group, The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco,
discovered the filing and filed protests asking the PUC to block
the proposed change. They want to know how many consumers are
affected and are openly skeptical of Pac Bell's assertion, in the
filing, that ``there are no revenue impacts associated with this
filing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All we've seen from Pacific Bell, lately, is attempts to get
more money with lesser service,'' said Regina Costa,
telecommunications analyst for TURN.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell said the use of the advice letter process was
appropriate because the PUC doesn't have jurisdiction over yellow
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates cite Pac Bell's current request to raise
prices for local directory assistance calls. It would raise the
maximum cost, per call, from 25 cents to as much as $1.10, the
highest price in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like they're making telephone directories a lesser
product to heighten demand for their directory assistance
services,'' said Kelly Boyd, telephone analyst for the PUC's Office
of Ratepayer Advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that's not the plan _ and Pac Bell says it isn't _ the
PUC should look closely at anything that makes it more costly or
difficult for people to get access to telephone information, said
Costa, especially since area code splits mean many people live in
one area code but work in another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think it's fair to strip away part of a directory and
continue to charge people the same price they paid for a better
product,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell defends its filing by saying the PUC surrendered
jurisdiction over yellow pages in 1980, declaring them a
competitive product whose prices should be set by the marketplace.
As such, the tariff change simply makes clear what is already the
case, that Pac Bell can do what it wants with yellow pages so long
as it doesn't whittle away at white pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers have a right to only one product, the white pages,''
said Sandy Kivowitz, director of external affairs for Pacific Bell.
``We want the flexibility to decide what we want to do with an
unregulated product.''

 Sun, IBM Both Unleash Unix Against NT  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
New forms of Unix _ the venerable operating system that once
dominated computer networking _ soon could challenge Microsoft's
popular Windows NT in the corporate market.
<P>
   That's the hope of Sun Microsystems, which today will introduce
a souped-up version of its Solaris Unix software designed to run on
computers with Intel chips as easily as it runs on Sun's own
systems.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, IBM announced plans yesterday to create a similar
PC-compatible form of Unix in an alliance with Unix developer SCO
and Sequent, a leading maker of high-end network computer servers.
</P>
<P>
   Both moves could further Intel's quest to push its new Xeon
chips into the high end of the corporate market, which is dominated
by machines with proprietary chips from Sun, IBM, Hewlett-Packard
and Digital Equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has pinned its hopes for the network market on Windows
NT, which has been phenomenally successful over the past three
years. But Windows NT does a poor job of running network servers
with multiple processors. Microsoft said that the next version of
Windows NT will solve that problem, but it's been delayed until
sometime late next year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, new multiprocessor network computers featuring Xeon
chips have arrived on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, Unix was considered dead and buried,'' said Ed
Zander, chief operating officer for Sun of Mountain View. ``Now,
all this new hardware is coming out and there's no operating system
to run it. So everybody's scurrying to reinvent Unix.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Sun wants to carve out a new identity for Solaris 7,
its new system, distancing it from Unix in hopes that it will be
accepted as a system for PC networks.
</P>
<P>
   Solaris 7 is a 64-bit system, compared with Windows NT, which is
32 bits. That, says Sun, translates into a tenfold increase in
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone beyond Unix,'' Zander said. ``Solaris 7 has
capabilities that are not on any other Unix product in the market
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Daniel Kunstler of J.P. Morgan called the Sun
announcement ``a big milestone,'' adding that ```Sun wants Solaris
to be an alternative to NT.''
</P>
<P>
   In its announcement yesterday, IBM said it plans ``significant
investments'' to make its new product the leading Unix operating
system. Like Sun, it's developing a system to run on current and
future Intel chips as well as its own chips, in computers that
range from entry-level systems to big network servers.
</P>
<P>
   SCO, based in Santa Cruz, will help develop and market the new
Unix, and Sequent will put it on its high-end servers, including
systems it plans to ship at the end of 2000 with the next
generation of Intel chips.
</P>
<P>
   IBM said Intel is providing technical and marketing support.
</P>
<P>
   Rajiv Samant of IBM denied that the initiative signals a battle
between IBM and Microsoft. ``This has nothing to do with Unix
versus NT,'' he said. ``It's what can be done over the next 12 to
24 months to take leadership in the Unix marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun's Zander knocked the IBM announcement, calling it a
``pre-emptive strike'' to steal Sun's thunder. ``While some people
are talking about coming out with a new version of Unix, we went
out and did it,'' he said. ``This is reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey Powell, chief executive of Sequent, said Zander's remark
``shows that Sun recognizes the power of our initiative.''

 A World Without Wires  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rohini and Ravi Shankar grew weary of constantly missing phone
calls from their friends, clients and family.
<P>
   With a new baby, and four phone numbers _ at their home, their
home-based business and their two full-time jobs _ the Shankars
found it hard to keep in touch with everybody _ including each
other.
</P>
<P>
   So several months ago, the San Mateo couple bought two wireless
phones and told everyone they knew to reach them through the
pocket-size devices. Today, the Web site designers zip around the
Bay Area confident they can be reached wherever they are. It's
helped their business, their relationships and even their stress
levels.
</P>
<P>
   In a world of wires, where communication is often restricted to
a specific location, many people are unplugging themselves from the
ties that bind. From rural towns to big cities, phone users are
cutting the cord and shifting to wireless phones as their main
means of telecommunication.
</P>
<P>
   It's a phenomenon that's likely to continue, as wireless prices
fall and the quality of the networks improve. But whether the
United States will ever make a complete shift to wireless for voice
communication &LR;   &LR; remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say that more people will follow the Shankars'
example and ditch their wired phones for voice communication if
cellular carriers continue to reduce prices, fix holes in their
coverage and improve the battery life of phones.
</P>
<P>
   Prices Have Fallen
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see this migration happening, but there are still some
obstacles,'' said Andrew Cole, senior manager of wireless at
Renaissance Worldwide, a Boston research firm. ``The market is
going to move from place-to-place calling to person-to-person
calling. But price erosion needs to continue in order for that to
become reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Wireless prices have fallen significantly over the past few
years, but rates in the United States are still much higher than in
other parts of the world. The average monthly wireless bill in the
United States is now under $40, down from about $43 last year and
$48.50 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Developing Nations
</P>
<P>
   In Scandinavian countries, where wireless prices are cheaper,
about 45 percent of the voice traffic is conducted over wireless
phones. Wireless use is also high in some developing nations like
India and Africa, where traditional telephone service is rare. Many
countries have simply bypassed a copper wireline phone system in
favor of a wireless network, which is cheaper and quicker to build.
</P>
<P>
   But in the United States, where the traditional phone system is
reliable and considered the most sophisticated in the world, the
idea of chucking regular phone service may seem a tad hasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. has a fairly sophisticated and very efficient
wireline system, so not everyone can understand why you'd want to
go wireless,'' said Tim Ayers, spokesman for the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, in a word, is mobility.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can reach me anywhere and we're never out of touch,''
said Rohini Shankar. ``If we're shopping and in two different
stores, I can call my husband and tell him to pick something up. Or
if we're on the bridge and decide we need food, we call some place,
have them prepare it and pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Take a Hike
</P>
<P>
   Other people are bucking the trend simply because they can.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, Ron Coronado got so fed up with his local
phone company that he did what many dream of doing: He told them to
take a hike.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego schoolteacher disconnected his telephone service,
bought a wireless phone and told everyone he knew to reach him
through the pocket-size device.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the fifth-grade teacher is the envy of his phone-tethered
friends, as he cruises around California with a single phone number
that can reach him anywhere. He's also an icon at his school, where
students think it's cool that their teacher is cell phone-savvy.
</P>
<P>
   Coronado, who commutes between San Diego and Los Angeles on
weekends, said he grew tired of having to give out two or three
different phone numbers to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Need to Be Mobile
</P>
<P>
   ``I would miss calls because no one ever knew where I was,''
Coronado said. He prefers having one phone number that stays with
him, whether he's in the classroom, on the road or at the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Ayers said the need to be mobile and connected will drive more
people to use wireless devices as their primary phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mobility and productivity go together,'' Ayers said. ``There
is worldwide demand for people to be productive, and to do that
they need to be in constant contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that's what prompted Londa Hentges to ditch her service
with US West.
</P>
<P>
   The Minneapolis music producer, who went wireless about 18
months ago, said her business and her stress level have improved
since she got rid of her traditional telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   `A Microwave World'
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to have a home phone, a work phone and a pager and I
decided that people just don't have time to check three different
numbers,'' Hentges said. ``We live in a microwave world and people
want instant access.''
</P>
<P>
   Hentges uses between 2,900 and 3,400 minutes of airtime a month
and runs up several hundred dollars in bills. It's more expensive
than what she paid for her US West phone, but she said the
accessibility it affords makes it worth the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of service to me and to my clients. It shows
that I respect their business because I'm reachable all the time,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure she stays connected, Hentges carrys an extra
battery with her at all times. Most people who have gone wireless
say they keep their phones charging while in the car or at the
office. And most carry a spare or two just in case of emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless Numbers Increasing
</P>
<P>
   While Hentges, Coronado and the Shankars are still considered
pioneers, the most conservative studies predict that by 2007, more
than 25 percent of all voice communication will be carried over a
wireless network. Other studies place the number at 70 percent or
higher.
</P>
<P>
   That's not hard to believe, given the increasing growth of
wireless subscribers. The United States now has more than 60
million wireless customers _ an increase of 12 million from June of
last year, according to CTIA.
</P>
<P>
   As voice traffic migrates to wireless networks, industry leaders
say the copper phone network will be used primarily for data
transmissions, such as file transfers, credit card transactions and
Internet access. It's already happening on some networks. Ameritech
Corp., the Midwest phone company that's about to be swallowed by
SBC Communications, says about half of the traffic it handles is
data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wireless will take a huge majority share of voice revenue
going forward and wireline will become a data-driven pipe,'' said
Cole, who does consulting for both wireless and wireline companies.
``Wireline is ideal for things like multimedia and streaming
video.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Telecom Firms Scrambling
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications companies realize this shift is under way and
are scrambling to find ways to capitalize on both wireless and
wireline networks.
</P>
<P>
   Many regional phone companies, such as Pacific Bell, have begun
offering high-speed Internet access over traditional copper wires
through a technology called digital subscriber lines.
</P>
<P>
   And most phone companies _ both long-distance and local _ have
wireless subsidiaries that are trying to benefit from the
migration. AT&AMP;T Wireless, for example, has launched an aggressive
``One Rate'' campaign to entice users into making more wireless
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS offers cheaper rates and other incentives to
customers who sign up for both the company's long-distance and
wireless phone service.
</P>
<P>
   But before more people join the ranks of the wireless masses,
the devices need to become more reliable. While wireless phones are
significantly better than they were just two or three years ago,
there are still places across the country and abroad that aren't
covered by the existing cellular networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the bane of our existence,'' said Ayers of CTIA.
</P>
<P>
   Landlines Left Behind
</P>
<P>
   Albert Lin, a wireless analyst with the Abernathy Group in San
Francisco, said once the quality problems are resolved, he expects
to see even more people leaving landlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once price comes down and voice becomes more reliable I see
people saying, `There's nothing landline service offers me that I
can't get in wireless.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For Coronado, a wireless phone offers something a home phone
never could: cache with his students.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think it's cool,'' he said. ``If one of the students gets
an A on a test, I let them call their mom or dad,'' he said. The
phone also works as a deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep it on all the time so if a student is acting up I say
`If you're having a problem, we can call your mom and dad.' ''
</P>

 Phone Future _ Wireless Link to Web  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The wireless phone industry has seen the future and it is data
driven. Companies from Nokia to Nextel are racing to develop a new
crop of wireless phones that will perform sophisticated data
services like lightning-fast Internet connections,
videoconferencing and e-mail.
<P>
   With better voice quality and coverage anywhere you roam, the
wireless industry is now focused on what it thinks phone users will
demand in the 21st century _ phones that can do it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to have an Internet browser in your phone, be able
to check e-mail, have a computerized map in your car, perform
videoconferencing or do remote diagnostics, these new `Star
Trek'-type devices will do all that,'' said Vince Tobkin, director
of technology and telecommunications at Bain &AMP; Co., a research firm
in San Francisco. ``It isn't going to change basic phone
conversation one iota, but it will change what we use the phones
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the phones won't hit the market until 1999 or later, but
manufacturers and software developers are already tempting
technophiles with what these devices will be capable of. A sample
of the upcoming technologies:
</P>
<P>
   _ Global Positioning Systems that will allow wireless phones to
figure out a user's location and then direct them to the nearest
gas station, highway entrance or Italian restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   _ Phones that will double as personal organizers so users can
check their calendar, look up a phone number and dial it with the
push of a button.
</P>
<P>
   _ Internet connections at rates faster than regular, wired phone
lines that will let users surf the Web and send e-mail from their
phones.
</P>
<P>
   _ Remote diagnostics that will allow doctors to tap into a
hospital's system with their phone and scan X-rays and patient
charts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Phones that can travel to any corner of the globe and work on
noncompatible cellular systems.
</P>
<P>
   The main driver behind the new crop of wireless devices is the
ability to get on the Net from a portable phone.
</P>
<P>
   Nokia Corp., like most of the major manufacturers, is developing
an Internet cellular phone, which has a built-in wireless modem.
Some will have Internet connections faster than an ISDN line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see anyone doing multimedia as they drive down the
highway, but we believe people will use these phones for all types
of applications in various situations,'' said Bill Nelson, vice
president for Lucent Technologies' Wireless Network group. New
Jersey-based Lucent makes the infrastructure inside many portable
phones.
</P>
<P>
   While the bells and whistles of these phones make for great,
splashy demos, industry observers say they won't be successful
unless they're small and easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first products to hit the market will be a hybrid
phone/personal organizer from Qualcomm Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The pdQ phone, due next year for an undetermined price, will
incorporate digital phone service with the electronic organizer
capabilities of 3Com's PalmPilot III. You will be able to make
calls right from your address book, wirelessly access information
on the Internet, and send and receive e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``People take out a pager, a phone, a PalmPilot, a whole
proliferation of devices. They want all these things to communicate
data,'' said Jeff Belk, vice president of marketing for Qualcomm in
San Diego. Albert Lin, who follows the wireless industry for The
Abernathy Group in San Francisco, said a product like pdQ sounds
great, but is too unwieldy for the average consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pdQ is a fantastic merger of two different technologies
but you would be hard pressed to find someone to consider the
solution elegant,'' Lin said. ``To merge the two together, they've
created a device that's heavy and complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Lin said next-generation wireless phone products will only work
if the fusion of technologies is user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers agree and say they are working to develop phones
that are lightweight and easier to program than a VCR.

 Satellite Phones Work From Jungles to Concrete Canyons  &HT;       
 Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Thirteen years ago, a team of engineers at Motorola had a great
idea: launching satellites that could beam wireless phone service
to any place on Earth _ from the jungles of Costa Rica to the
deserts of Egypt.
<P>
   Satellite technology had become cheap enough that the idea was
financially feasible, and the demand existed because of gaps in the
land-based cellular network.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade later, the concept is about to become reality
as Iridium LLC prepares to launch its $5.5 billion satellite phone
network on  &LR; November  &LR; 1. The company will sell phones that will let
callers communicate from any place on Earth. Globalstar Systems is
readying its own network that will go live next fall; another
company, ICO Global Communications, plans to launch a similar
service in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But what seemed innovative in the late 1980s may now be too
little too late, according to some in the industry. In the years it
took to build the satellite system, terrestrial wireless coverage
has improved, phone costs have come down and carriers have patched
many of the rough spots that once plagued wireless networks.
</P>
<P>
   About 95 percent of the United States is now covered by cellular
networks, and many European countries are at similar levels. Even
developing nations like Chile, Africa and Brazil are deploying
sophisticated digital cellular networks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, new phone technologies are enabling traditional
wireless phones to be used on almost every corner of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite phones, which are expected to sell for $1,500 to
$3,000, may have a hard time competing with cheaper cellular
handsets that can be used in most major cities and small towns. In
addition to the high sticker price, satellite phone service will
also be costly, at $1 to $3 per minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these satellite systems were designed 10 years ago,
when people believed cellular costs would be much higher and the
coverage would be much lower,'' said Vince Tobkin, director of the
technology and telecom practice at Bain &AMP; Co. in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the intervening 10 years, cellular networks have built out
like mad and the cellular prices have gotten very low. Satellite
phones have to compete against very inexpensive cellular in most
parts of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But satellite companies such as Iridium of Washington, D.C., and
Globalstar &UR;  &LR; Systems, headquartered in San Jose, say they are
targeting the small, niche market of users that must communicate in
places that are not covered by existing cellular networks.
</P>
<P>
   They plan to market their phones to two distinct groups:
international business travelers and individuals or companies that
work in remote areas, such as those in the oil, natural gas, mining
and maritime industries.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of satellite phones is that they will work in big
cities and in the middle of the ocean. When a user is in New York,
for example, the phone will operate on a land-based cellular
system. Take a plane to Siberia and the same phone will work using
a satellite connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can provide service in every country of the world,'' said
Craig Bond, Iridium's vice president of marketing. ``All you'll
have is one phone number that's reachable anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a marked improvement over the current generation of
satellite phones, which are bulky, expensive and difficult to use.
</P>
<P>
   The new satellite systems will function like cellular antennas
in the sky, routing wireless phone calls through low-orbit
satellites circling the globe. After receiving the phone call
signal, the satellite will beam the call to a routing station on
the ground, which sends it to the phone being called.
</P>
<P>
   To make this happen, the satellites need to be close enough _
within 900 miles _ &UR;  &LR; to Earth to send and receive signals. Their low
orbit, however, means the satellites won't keep pace with the
Earth's rotation. That's why Iridium and Globalstar need several
dozen satellites _ as one moves out of position, a call will be
handed off to another satellite. The switch is supposed to be
seamless, with no interruption to the user.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium and Globalstar also plan to offer satellite paging
services, which will cost about $500 for the pager.
</P>
<P>
   As cool as satellite services may sound, the market is still
limited, according to those who track the industry. Strategis Group
predicts there will be about 8.8 million satellite phone users over
the next 10 years. The traditional cellular market has about 200
million subscribers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium says its own research places the global market potential
closer to 12 million, and Globalstar says the market could reach 30
million.
</P>
<P>
   John Cunningham, a spokesman for Globalstar, said the
capabilities of these phones are too great for them not to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of having a briefcase full of phones, you'll have one
phone and one number that works anywhere in the world,'' Cunningham
said. Globalstar plans to start offering its service next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium's Bond said interest in the phones is so great that the
company already has a waiting list of potential customers. He would
not disclose how many people are on the list, but said it includes
both U.S. and international customers.
</P>
<P>
   With a $180 million marketing campaign surrounding Iridium's
launch, analysts said they expect an initial demand for the phones.
The real test, however, will be how often the phones are used. With
per-minute rates between $1 and $3, many analysts expect phone
usage to drop after consumers see the first month's bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The per-minute charges are exorbitant,'' said Greg Caressi,
who follows the satellite industry for Frost &AMP; Sullivan in San
Francisco. ``I doubt at the cost of price-per-minute that many
people are really going to use it very much.''
</P>
<P>
   The phones' potential may also be hurt by the multitude of
problems surrounding their deployment. Both Iridium and Globalstar
have been plagued by problems including software glitches,
technical flaws and rocket failures. The most recent occurred last
month, when 12 satellites intended for Globalstar's system burned
to a crisp during a failed launch. The explosion set Globalstar's
deployment back several months. Iridium has also had to push back
its start date because of software bugs.
</P>
<P>
   The delays have given alternate technologies a chance to gain
steam and grab headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest threat to satellite phones are two global
(cellular) phones from Ericsson and Nokia,'' Ernst said. Those
phones will be able to roam on various frequencies throughout the
world, much like the satellite phones, but won't work in as many
countries.
</P>
<P>
   A new crop of wireless devices, known as Third Generation
phones, could also hamper the satellite market, Ernst said.
</P>
<P>
   For the satellite phones to succeed, most in the industry agree
the devices need to come down in cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once there are three competitors &UR;  &LR; and price per-minute comes
down, then it becomes much more possible that the average consumer
would buy one of these,'' Caressi said. ``Until that happens, it's
going to be a niche market product.''

 Prepaid calling cards bringing in new customers  &HT;       
 By Carolyn Said 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The image of cellular phones as toys for BMW-driving yuppies does
have some small basis in reality.
<P>
   Until recently, you couldn't get cellular service unless you
could pass a credit check. That left the ``credit-challenged'' _
people with bad credit, or those who had never established credit _
out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   But a new type of service, prepaid cellular, has opened up
wireless phones to a throng of customers who couldn't qualify
before _ or who simply prefer the pay-as-you-go convenience.
</P>
<P>
   With prepaid, you buy a phone and a calling card for a certain
dollar amount _ usually in denominations ranging from $30 to $90 _
then call the cellular provider to activate service. Every time you
make a call, a voice tells you how many minutes of service you have
left. When you use up one card, you buy another. You can switch
carriers whenever you purchase a new card.
</P>
<P>
   Basic cellular phones generally cost about $100, but you can pay
as little as $40 for a ``refurbished'' one. Expect to pay a premium
if you want a diminutive, lightweight model. The phone is yours
even if you stop service.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of prepaid-service customers don't want to commit to a
long-term relationship or want to keep a lid on their cell phone
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Parents give prepaid cellular cards to kids away at college,
businesses get them for employees so their expense accounts won't
spring any surprises and drivers put them in their car glove
compartments for emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prepaid has taken this country by storm, and it will become a
bigger part of our wireless world,'' said David Berndt, program
manager at the Yankee Group.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The research firm forecasts that the U.S. prepaid wireless
market will hit $10.3 billion by 2002, with 23 million prepaid
users, or one out of every five wireless subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Shawn Wilson, a Hayward, Calif., political consultant, said
he chose prepaid cellular for its convenience and flexibility.
``Some months are much more busy for me than others,'' he said.
``From December to March, I don't need a cell phone, and it's silly
to pay for something I don't use.''
</P>
<P>
   But during election season _ Wilson is now the campaign manager
for Ellen Corbett, a San Leandro Democrat seeking an Assembly seat
_ he is frequently on the road and on the phone. When a campaign is
in swing, a cellular phone ``is an absolute necessity for me,'' he
said. ``Being out and running around I need to be accessible to
everyone _ my consulting firm, my candidate, constituents,
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Prepaid phones can be purchased at the usual consumer
electronics outlets but also at populist places like Kmart, Longs
Drugs, Bradlees and Northern Auto. Those chains all offer a package
from SmarTalk Teleservices of Dublin, Ohio, that includes a $99
phone, a rechargeable battery, a charger and $15 of talk time with
the purchase of another prepaid cellular card. GTE Wireless sells
prepaid cellular cards at Bay Area 7-Eleven stores.
</P>
<P>
   But the convenience of prepaid service comes at a price. You can
expect to rack up 75 cents to $1 a minute for prepaid airtime. By
shopping around for a regular cellular plan, you can get rates
under 10 cents a minute.
</P>
<P>
   And prepaid has other drawbacks. Some plans don't let you roam
outside a limited service area. Long-distance calls can get hit
with a hefty surcharge _ more than you'd pay with a regular
wireless plan. Some prepaid services don't allow international
calls.
</P>
<P>
   That's not stopping the explosive growth. Although prepaid
accounts for just 5 percent of the total U.S. wireless market, 15
percent of new wireless customers choose prepaid, according to Mark
Lowenstein, vice president for wireless research and consulting at
the Yankee Group.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called credit challenged are still an important market
for prepaid service. The Yankee Group estimates that 30 percent of
applicants for wireless service plans flunk the credit check. With
prepaid, that's not an issue.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  People who are concerned about privacy are another target.
</P>
<P>
   With regular cell phones, the carrier keeps track of every call
_ and lists them on your monthly bill. With prepaid, there is no
paper trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't keep track of your calls,'' said Joe Borocz, senior
vice president of marketing for SmarTalk. ``Even if we're
subpoenaed (for a prepaid customer's phone records), no one will
ever know who you called, when you called or for how long.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Borocz said prepaid also is ideal for ``people who don't want
their wives or husbands to know (whom) they call.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a quip that the service sounds perfect for
adulterers, he joked to a reporter, ``I can send you a phone if you
want to cheat.''

impossible to withdraw cab fare from a bank machine in the early

been a population explosion among moose. And they've been spotted

 Finding the Long-Distance Plan That Works for You  &HT;       
 By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Possibly the only thing more complicated than deciphering this
year's ballot propositions is choosing a long-distance company.
<P>
   Although the big three _ AT&AMP;T, MCI and Sprint _ still control
most of the long-distance market, hundreds of companies are
competing to sell services.
</P>
<P>
   Making things even trickier is the rise of the so-called
dial-around deals such as 10-321 that let consumers place calls
with long-distance companies other than their chosen carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Although ads for these deals promise big savings, they don't
always deliver, said Rebecca Sachs, a spokeswoman for the
Telecommunications Research and Action Center (TRAC), a
Washington-based consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the more prominent providers, 10-10-3-2-1 and the newly
launched Lucky Dog, appear to be feisty new entrants into the
long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 10-321 is MCI, Sachs said. And Lucky Dog is AT&AMP;T in
disguise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dial-arounds have been generating a lot of interest, but
from our perspective, consumers aren't necessarily saving money,''
Sachs said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the dial-arounds require that calls last at least 20
minutes before the savings kick in, she said. Others charge a
monthly fee or a connection fee that erases any savings.
</P>
<P>
   The best way for consumers to save money on long-distance is to
get on a calling plan, even if it's with your current carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as simple as calling your long-distance carrier and
asking, `Am I on the best plan for my calling patterns?' It only
takes a minute,'' Sachs advised.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't ask for a calling plan, you're likely to wind up
with standard service, which is generally more costly. Rates for
long-distance service have fallen to under 9 cents, but in all
cases these plans charge a monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   To ease consumer confusion, a number of companies have
introduced one-rate plans that charge the same rate no matter what
time of day the call is made.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best deals right now are available to people who are
at ease with the Internet. AT&AMP;T, MCI and Frontier offer plans with
either low rates or low monthly fees to households that agree to
pay by credit card and get all their customer service online.
America Online offers a similar long-distance calling plan to AOL
customers only.
</P>
<P>
   Rates for most other plans vary according to when you make a
call. The lower rates go into effect at 5, 6 or 7 p.m. on
weeknights instead of at 11 p.m. Under these plans, weekday calls
between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. may be twice as costly as night and
weekend calls. In exchange, customers generally get lower night and
weekend rates than the one-rate plans offer and are charged no
monthly fees.
</P>
<P>
   How do you figure out what's right for you?
</P>
<P>
   _ Get on a calling plan. According to TRAC, consumers can cut
their bills in half by opting for a calling plan instead of basic
service.
</P>
<P>
   _ Even if you have a plan, it may not be the best one. Plans and
promotions change all the time, and the newest plans are often the
best. Long-distance companies won't automatically switch you to the
newest plan or the one that will save you the most money.
</P>
<P>
   _ Know your calling patterns. Before you shop around, look at
your last two or three phone bills to find out how much you
generally spend on long-distance calls, where you call, what times
you make most calls and if you call the same people frequently.
Once you've got that, you can match your calling patterns to the
best phone plan.
</P>
<P>
   Price is generally the most important factor to consider, since
sound quality doesn't differ that much among carriers, advises
Consumer Reports magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Callers who spend a lot on long-distance calls might benefit
from a volume-discount plans such as GTE Easy Savings or Sprint
Sense. Those who make most of their calls at night or on weekends
might consider one of the two-rate options such as MCI One Savings
or Frontier's HomeSaver. But be aware: Off-peak periods aren't the
same for every carrier or even the same for every plan a carrier
offers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Read the fine print for monthly fees and minimums. A plan that
features a 10-cents-a-minute rate but carries a monthly fee
probably won't make sense for people who make few long-distance
calls.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bargain. Before you switch carriers, it often pays to contact
your current carrier and see if you can get a better deal. In most
cases, your long-distance company will want to keep you as a
customer and will offer you something better as an incentive.
</P>
<P>
   Special offers may make it worthwhile to switch, but be sure
that you won't end up paying more in the long run. According to
research by the Yankee Group in Boston, more and more customers are
switching carriers every year _ one in four residential subscribers
switched long-distance providers last year, the research group
says, compared with less than 17 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep in mind your other phone services. If you use calling
cards or cellular telephones a lot, or if you accept a lot of
collect calls, be sure to compare those rates. Some long-distance
companies offer lower rates to customers who also buy their
Internet access from that carrier.
</P>
<P>
   To help evaluate phone services, TRAC publishes twice-yearly
Tele-Tips reports that contain in- depth comparisons of the top
eight providers that make up 90 percent of the market. The next
report for business customers will be out at the end of this month
and the next report for residential customers comes out shortly
before Thanksgiving. To get a report, send $5 per
residential-service report and $7 per small-business report and a
self-addressed self-stamped envelope with two stamps to TRAC, PO
Box 27279, Washington, D.C. 20005.
</P>
<P>
   TRAC also has a Web site that allows consumers to make pricing
comparisons,  &LR; www.trac.org. &LR;

 Balance Speed, Cost When Choosing Your Net Connection  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Internet has moved so thoroughly into the mainstream that it's
no longer a question of whether a personal computer user should be
online. The only question is what kind of connection to use.
<P>
   The answer depends on how fast you want to surf the Net, and how
much money you're willing to spend for extra speed. Today's choices
range from a basic telephone modem that can creep along at 28.8
kilobytes per second or less, to a cable line capable of
downloading files a hundred times faster than that.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a rundown of the most popular options. Keep in mind that
some of them _ the cable in particular _ are not available yet in
every community.
</P>
<P>
   MODEMS: This is the method used by most consumers _ largely
because almost all PCs now come with built-in modems. You can also
buy modems at computer and electronics stores. Modems plug into a
phone line and let you connect to an Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Many notebook computers also come with built-in modems. And most
notebooks have a slot that can accommodate a credit-card-sized
modem. There are even wireless modems. One company, Metricom of Los
Gatos, sells a system called Ricochet that combines a wireless
modem with Internet access. It's only available in a few
metropolitan regions _ but the Bay Area is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Speed: &LR;  The fastest modems available are 56K models _ although
they don't really run at a full 56,000 bits per second speed.
Federal law precludes downloads faster than 53K over regular phone
lines, and many lines can't support anything even in the 50s. Your
distance from the phone center can also affect the speed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cost &LR; : A 56K modem can be had for under $100. (Notebook modems
are more expensive.) You'll also need an account from an Internet
service provider, which will run, on average, $20 a month. And if
you plan to use your Internet connection extensively, you should
consider a second phone line so that you can have one line for
phone calls. The second line should cost under $20 a month if you
connect to the Net via a local call.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pros &LR; : Modems are the cheapest way to get online. They work on
regular phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cons &LR; : They're too slow to take full advantage of streaming
audio and video. And they tie up your phone line.
</P>
<P>
   ISDN: &UR;  &LR; Short for Integrated Services Digital Network, ISDN is a
service from the phone company that permits phone lines to carry
data more than twice as quickly as the fastest modem.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Speed: &LR;  Up to 128 kbps on downloads.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cost: &LR;  $305 for Pac Bell's ISDN Home Pack, which includes a
special modem. Installation is $125. The monthly rate is $55.95,
which gets you 200 off-peak hours of Internet access (from 5 p.m to
8 a.m. and all weekend).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pros: &LR;  Faster than a modem.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cons: &LR;  Expensive, sometimes hard to set up and slow compared
with other alternatives. And there's an installation fee.
</P>
<P>
   DSL: Stands for Digital Subscriber Line. Available from the
phone company as well as some Internet service providers, DSL
provides high bandwidth over existing lines, utilizing a special
modem and a network card that goes inside the PC.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Speed: &LR;  The basic service accesses the Net at 384 kbps, but you
can also get 1.5 mbps if you really feel the need for speed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cost: &LR;  Pac Bell's DSL Home Pack, including a modem and network
card, is $299. Then it's $89 per month for unlimited access at 384
kbps, $279 for 1.5 mbps.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pros: &LR;  Easy to set up and a lot faster than ISDN. The Internet
connection is always on, which means you don't have to dial each
time to connect. You can fax or talk on the phone at the same time
you're online.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cons: &LR;  Costs more than most consumers are willing to pay for
the Internet. Not yet available everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   CABLE: &UR;  &LR; Cable companies including Tele-Communications Inc. offer
high-speed Internet access in selected communities right through
the TV cable. In the Bay Area, the service is provided in
conjunction with AtHome.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Speed: &LR;  AtHome claims it delivers the Internet at between 1.5
and 3 mbps _ making it by far the fastest alternative for most
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cost: &LR;  The installation ranges from $99 to $175, depending on
your area. That includes a network card that goes in your computer,
plus running the cable to the PC. Monthly Internet access is
between $30 and $50, also depending on where you live.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pros: &LR;  Very fast and always on, cable Internet is a pleasure to
use. Also, it doesn't jam up your regular phone line.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cons: &LR;  Not all communities have been upgraded to the two-way
cable system necessary for Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   SATELLITE: Like TV, the Internet can be accessed at high speed
over a satellite using a small dish antenna. The main provider of
the service is DirecPC, a division of Hughes Network Systems.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Speed: &LR;  Up to 400 kbps.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cost:  &LR; $299 for the DirecPC Personal Edition, which includes a
dish and controller (installation is extra). There's an activation
fee of $49.95. Monthly rates start at $29.99 for 25 hours of
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pros: &LR;  Good speed, and you can use it anywhere. All you need is
a clear line of sight to the south, and room somewhere on the
outside of your house for a 21-inch dish.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cons: &LR;  After you exhaust your monthly access, you get dinged
$1.99 an hour. The system only works with PCs using Windows 95/ 98
or Windows NT. No Macs.

<P>
   NORRISTOWN, Pa. _ It was a recent lunchtime and John Kagwe of
Kenya was eating a Philadelphia cheese steak the size of a
catcher's mitt. Actually, it was a variation called a pizza steak,
which included the four basic food groups: fat, grease, french
fries and enough cheese to line a 26.2-mile marathon course.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem,'' said Kagwe, who won the New York City Marathon
last year and nearly broke the course record despite having to stop
twice to tie his shoe. ``Tomorrow all this fat will be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a man who had run 20 miles earlier in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous athletic sons of Norristown are baseball types,
Tommy Lasorda and Mike Piazza. There is a strong Italian influence
in this governmental center of Montgomery County, the wealthiest in
Pennsylvania. But Norristown has also become an unlikely hub of
distance running for Kenyans, who are managed by a former
television anchor and who train in the splendidly rolling hills and
forests of Valley Forge National Park.
</P>
<P>
   A group of nine Kenyans lives in a rented home in Norristown,
hanging a Kenyan flag on the wall of the living room and spreading
out through three bedrooms and a finished basement. Kagwe will try
for his second victory in New York on Sunday. Joining him will be a
training partner, Peter Githuka, who won the Philadelphia Distance
Run, a half-marathon, in September.
</P>
<P>
   The Norristown runners are from the Kikuyu ethnic group, which
makes up only about 10 percent of Kenya's top distance runners,
most of whom are Kalenjin. In what has become a yearly ritual,
Kagwe, 29, has trained in Norristown since July, leaving his wife,
Beatrice, to take care of their three children and the family farm
in Miharati, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss my family,'' Kagwe said. ``But I concentrate better
when I am here. People think if you are Kenyan, you just come from
your village and you run and win. That's not how it works. This is
a business. You have to train hard and concentrate to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Training in Valley Forge involves a tradeoff: Kagwe can perform
faster workouts at the lower altitude, but he loses out on the
increased oxygen-carrying capacity gained from training at Kenya's
elevation.
</P>
<P>
   If he is not racing, he sometimes does three training runs of up
to 20 miles a week. ``My body likes a lot of air,'' Kagwe said. ``I
can't train as much when there is little air.''
</P>
<P>
   He lives a professional runner's existence, training, eating,
sleeping, reading the Bible and watching soccer and movies on
television. The runners divide the cooking and cleaning chores.
Valley Forge is a 20-minute run from the house. Soccer was his
first love. He did not come to running until he was 18 and looking
for a sport that relied on the individual instead of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do bad in football, people come to argue; there are a
lot of quarrels,'' Kagwe said. ``I don't like that. I wanted a game
of my own.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago in New York, Kagwe won in 2 hours 8 minutes 12
seconds. He would have shattered the course record of 2:08:01, set
in 1989 by Juma Ikangaa of Tanzania, if he had not had to stop
twice to retie the shoelaces of his Nikes. They came loose a third
time and he ran the final four miles with the laces flapping
against his legs, lucky that he did not trip and fall.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Kagwe would like to break the course record, though
the recent world record of 2:06:05, set in Berlin on Sept. 20 by
Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil, is almost certainly beyond anyone on
New York's bridges and hills. The buzz in the running community is
that Kagwe is not as sharp as he was last season. Indeed, in late
September, he stopped along the way on a hot, humid morning in the
Philadelphia half-marathon before finishing eighth in 1:06:22.
</P>
<P>
   His training was interrupted by an unplanned return to Kenya
this summer to take care of personal business. While he was home,
his grandfather died. On the day of the bombing of the U.S. Embassy
in Nairobi, Kagwe was in the Kenyan capital to bury his
grandfather. He considered making a phone call to his agent, Lisa
Buster, that morning from a building near the embassy, but did not,
given the eight-hour time difference. He remained at the mortuary,
while the building sustained considerable damage in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have been hurt, or possibly killed,'' Buster said.
</P>
<P>
   Kagwe said, ``I feel like God was with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the interruption, Kagwe has been training through
most of his races this fall. And if others are discounting him, he
feels it may work in his favor in New York, where the head is as
important as the legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot of pressure,'' Kagwe said. ``I know guys are
asking, `What is John Kagwe doing?' I haven't run very good in
small races. They might think I'm not in good shape. Maybe that
will be an advantage for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagwe first came to the United States to run the Boston Marathon
in 1994, and finished 16th, while the prize money went only 15
deep, Buster said. Kagwe was referred to her by friends in
Schenectady, N.Y. ``I thought, why not, this guy's got some
talent,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Buster is one of a handful of female agents in the
distance-running business. Having received a language degree from
the University of North Carolina in 1981, she has worked as a radio
sports reporter in Philadelphia, Washington and North Carolina and
a television news anchor in Helena, Mont. In 1984, she fell into
road-race management by mapping out a series of races for a Dutch
friend in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   She is married to El-Mostafa Nechchadi of Morocco, a world-class
marathoner in the 1980's, and her clients come by referral. She
lines up races for Kagwe and his training partners, takes them
shopping for cornmeal to make the carbohydrate-rich dish called
ugali, transports them to the airport to catch their flights.
</P>
<P>
   She appreciates the Kenyans, she said, because ``they are nice,
generous, hard-working, religious people.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``I admire them tremendously. They put a lot of
importance on the family, and they are intent on making good
futures for their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Buster bristles when race officials and reporters say that the
Kenyans must promote themselves better. She blames the news media
for being lazy and insensitive in portraying Kenyan runners.
Newspaper headlines often say only that a Kenyan wins a race, she
said, without naming the runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Andre Agassi wins Wimbledon, they don't say, `American
wins,''' Buster said. ``It depersonalizes the Kenyans. They do a
lot of work; they should get the credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagwe received ample attention for winning New York last year,
especially running in shoes that he got the day before the race and
could not keep tied.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, maybe I'm thinking of using older shoes,'' he
said. &QL;

ON THE RUN EVERY DAY, FOR MORE THAN 23 YEARS

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Most of the 30,000 people who will run the New York
City Marathon on Sunday train daily for the 26.2-mile event. Some
manage to run every day for weeks, even months. But one entrant has
not missed a day of running since Gerald Ford was president and
disco filled the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Behr, a 51-year-old Staten Island schoolteacher, is the
Cal Ripken of running. He has run every single day for more than 23
years _ 8,623 days in a row, assuming the streak is intact today.
Behr has covered, by his count, 85,491 miles, an average of just
under 10 miles a day since the streak began on March 19, 1975. Or
to put it another way, more than three times the circumference of
the earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a healthy obsession,'' said Behr, who worked as an
administrator for AT&AMP;T for 32 years before going into teaching.
``Every morning at 6, I run six miles, and I'm ready to start my
day. I feel great.''
</P>
<P>
   In running-streak circles, minimum daily mileage is a flash
point. Ron Hill of Britain, the 1970 Boston Marathon champion, who
is the undisputed world leader at 34 years and counting, has a
somewhat vague three-mile minimum. A few times, Hill, when injured,
hobbled a mile or so on crutches.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't feel like running, you think about Jimmy out
there every day for 23 years,'' said Bobby Orazem, president of the
Staten Island Athletic Club, to which Behr belongs. ``And Jimmy's
minimum run is five miles a day. Some streakers count running to
the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-10-inch, 140-pound Behr, with his carrot-colored
hair, looks closer to 41 than 51. He said that his avocation had
not taken over his life _ his other loves include Shakespeare and
the Marx brothers _ and rather than draining him, his running had
given him motivation in other fields.
</P>
<P>
   Behr teaches English at Monsignor Farrell High School on Staten
Island and helps coach the cross-country team. He has master's
degrees in English and liberal studies from the City University of
New York and is working toward a Ph.D. in English at Drew
University. He is a third-degree black belt in tae kwon do and
taught martial arts for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started running to avoid middle-age spread of the body,''
Behr said. ``Now I continue schooling to avoid middle-age spread of
the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   When Behr starts his 24th New York City Marathon on Sunday at
the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, he will be fueled by images of
gutting through workouts despite illness and injury, of running in
the middle of the night when he had to, of running 100 miles a week
at one point when he thought he might be able to qualify for the
Olympic trials. He will also be able to recall exhilarating
adventures, like the run during the blizzard of '83 that made him a
local legend.
</P>
<P>
   During a two-foot snowstorm, Behr's commuter bus from Manhattan
broke down at 2 a.m. as it reached the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.
While the other riders waited to be rescued, Behr, dressed in work
clothes and carrying an attache case, ventured out into the snow
and proceeded to run 13 miles home. When he arrived two hours
later, he looked like an ice sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least he got home alive,'' his wife, Pam, said.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Behr tries to keep one stride ahead of her husband. Planning
their first cruise for a vacation next year, she has checked on
every contingency. ``I called the cruise line to see if Jim can run
on the boat,'' she said. ``God forbid there's a hurricane and you
can't get to the islands.''
</P>
<P>
   His running streak aside, Behr is the marathon's quintessential
everyman, an ordinary guy who has found a niche in running,
channeling his energy into it throughout the year and experiencing
the communal hero's welcome in his annual run through the city. He
modestly dismisses the streak. ``The significance of it is that
it's not significant,'' he said. ``I just get up every day and
run.''
</P>
<P>
   When the streak reached 20 years, he received a congratulatory
letter from Hill, who could not resist telling Behr that, no matter
what, he would never catch him. Behr said he did not care to. He is
competing against only himself, relishing the quaint rituals of
marathoning, like pasta dinners, and the memories of running New
York since the days when you could hang out with Bill Rodgers
before the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget 1976 and the first five-borough marathon,''
Behr said. ``The field went from 500 runners to over 2,000. I
didn't know there were 2,000 runners in the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   That year, Behr bumped into Rodgers at the Verrazano and, amid
the informal camaraderie that prevailed then, warmed up with him.
Rodgers won the race, and Behr, in his second New York City
Marathon, broke three hours for the first time. Three years later
at Boston, while Rodgers was setting an American record despite
stopping to tie his shoelaces, Behr was setting a personal record
(2:38:19) despite training while working the lobster shift at AT&AMP;T
and running on his lunch hour at 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Behr has not broken 3 hours in 15 years, and his goal for Sunday
is 3:30 (an eight-minute-mile pace), which would qualify him for
next year's Boston Marathon. He has been running 60 miles a week,
some of it with a neighbor, Phil Bohrer, who keeps Behr company on
his long training runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think we'd talk about the marathon or baseball while on
the road,'' Bohrer said, ``but Jimmy brings up the classics, like
`Beowulf.' Running with him is an intellectual experience.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, it can be a scary experience. If Behr catches the flu,
he still runs. A couple of years ago at Christmas, he was so ill,
he enlisted his daughter, Elizabeth, a college student, to run and
be at his side during his workout. ``Just in case he dropped
dead,'' Pam Behr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our Assisted Runner Program,'' Jimmy said.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of Behr's discipline were planted in Vietnam, where he
saw combat during the Tet offensive in 1968. He said: ``The
officers told you: `What if the V.C. attacks at 5 a.m.? Are you
going to tell them, `It's too early; I haven't had my morning
coffee'? So if I have to run at 4 or 5 in the morning, it's nothing
special.''
</P>
<P>
   Behr's admirers disagree. They say that in a world where there
is less and less to depend on, Behr's longevity is a comforting
source of stability. And even Behr has a sense of doing something
pure and honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything today is so controlled and processed,'' Behr said.
``Running every single day flies in the face of what our mass
culture seems to value. I guess that makes me proud.''
</P>
<P>
   How long can Behr's streak last?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy will make the decision when the streak will end,'' said
Tim Behr, an assistant principal at Monsignor Farrell and his
brother's cross-country co-coach. ``Just like Cal Ripken did.'' &QL;
