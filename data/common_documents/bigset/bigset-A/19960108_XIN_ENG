<HEADLINE> World Bank Offers Help To Solve Angola's Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A visiting World Bank official
today pledged the bank's "full support" to Angola which she said
was torn apart by an "economic crisis."
</P>
<P>
Katherine Marshall, director of the Southern African
Department of the World Bank, said at the end of her week-long
fact-finding trip that the crisis was caused by overstretched
expenditure of long years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, Marshall said the World
Bank is formulating an aid package to help Angola restore its
national economy.
</P>
<P>
She urged the Angolan people to devote "the greatest
possible effort" to helping settle this crisis along with the
government and the international community.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, she said she had discussed with Angolan
leaders on scope of the crisis, measures to find a solution, and
what role the international community should play in finding a
solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank official had also toured several provinces of
the Southern African country.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Condemns Violations of Humanitarian Law  in Croatia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
on Monday strongly condemned the violations of international
humanitarian law in the Krajina region of Croatia ever since the
government troops took the area back from the local Serb forces
last August.
</P>
<P>
The Council was acting on a report by U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, within which killings of several hundreds
of civilians, systematic and widespread looting and arson and
other forms of destruction of property were described.
</P>
<P>
"The Council expresses its deep concern that there is a
considerable discrepancy between the number of perpetrators that
have so far been brought to justice and the number of reported
violations of international humanitarian law and human rights,"
said a presidential statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Council urged the Government of the Republic of Croatia to
make every effort to arrest all perpetrators and bring them
promptly to trial," added the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement also expressed deep concern of the Council over
the humanitarian and security situation of the mostly elderly Serb
population who have remained in the Krajina region.
</P>
<P>
It demanded that the Croatian government stop "the continuing
extensive harassment and intimidation, looting of property and
other forms of abuse" as reported by the secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
The statement also mentioned the situation of the refugees from
Croatia who wish to return.
</P>
<P>
"The Council shares the secretary-general's view that the
rights of the members of the Serb population who fled during the
military operation to return to their homes in safety and dignity
are being severely curtailed by the absence of constructive
measures to facilitate their return," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Council reaffirms its demand that the government of the
Republic of Croatia respect fully the rights of the members of the
local Serb population, including their right to remain, leave or
return in safety," the statement added.

<P>
NAIROBI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A six-months-old drought has
driven an estimated 800,000 Somali nomads to migrate from
northwestern Somalia to areas bordering Ethiopia, said a report
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The report from the Djibouti-based Horn of Africa Development
Agency said the drought, centered in the Sol and Sanaag regions,
has so far killed an estimated 500,000 heads of cattle.
</P>
<P>
Sol and Sanaag were also the center of a severe drought in 1974
when 140,000 people were moved from the region with the help of a
soviet airlift to southern somalia.
</P>
<P>
During the drought twelve years ago, 18,000 people were killed
by famine and livestock losses were devastating.

<HEADLINE> Small Firms Responsible for 70% of UK's Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Small and medium-sized British
companies are responsible for nearly three-quarters of industrial
air pollution in Britain, according to BMS Bossard, the management
consultants.
</P>
<P>
The consultancy, which advises some of Britain's largest
companies on the issue, claimed that only 12 percent of Britain's
3.5 million small and medium-sized enterprises incorporate
environmental considerations into business plans.
</P>
<P>
Ron Brender, managing director of the consultancy, said
research by the British Chamber of Commerce suggested that only
one in five of smaller companies had encountered pressure from
their customers to improve their environmental performance.
</P>
<P>
While big, blue chip companies were aware of public opinion and
shareholder pressure, the emphasis in smaller enterprises was on
getting business in rather than worrying about the environment
around them, he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the continuing failure of smaller businesses to
take environmental issues seriously was understandable, given
limited staff and resources.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that without a change of attitudes, the sector
would remain a significant source of industrial pollution.
</P>
<P>
He said that the UK accounted for one-fifth of man-made
emissions of carbon dioxide in Europe, compared with 12 percent
from France and 13 percent from Italy.
</P>
<P>
BMS Bossard claimed that UK regulations on planning and
emissions from business premises were not strict enough.
</P>
<P>
Brender added that small and medium-sized businesses are vital
to Britain's long-term economic health and it is critical that
they take very seriously environmental issues.

<HEADLINE> Washington, Nicosia Agree on Overall Approach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and the United States
have agreed that there should be an overall approach to all key
issues composing the Cyprus problem and that all fundamental
questions should be on the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
This was stated here today by Cyprus Foreign Minister Alecos
Michaelides and U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Richard Boucher, after a
meeting at the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, the two diplomats said they exchanged
views on the forthcoming visit to Nicosia by Richard Holbrooke,
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian
Affairs, which is expected to take place in early February, and on
recent visits to Cyprus by foreign officials, including European
Union envoys.
</P>
<P>
Boucher said the U.S. would "address those (fundamental) issues
but we're going to address them together because we believe that
is the best way to go forward."
</P>
<P>
On his part, the Cypriot foreign minister stressed that "we
have made it clear to all that we do not accept a partial
discussion of the Cyprus problem, but we want an overall approach
to achieve common ground before negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Michaelides noted that the Greek Cypriot side's position on
this issue was now widely accepted.
</P>
<P>
Boucher noted the U.S. strategy in Cyprus was to get together
President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash "but on a basis that gives them some chance of success."
</P>
<P>
He said he would continue his meetings in Nicosia and efforts
"to set a comprehensive basis for agreement on the fundamental
issues."
</P>
<P>
Both Michaelides and Boucher denied press reports that
Washington had worked out a plan for solving the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides said the only decision by the U.S. was to address
the substance of the Cyprus problem with meetings in Nicosia,
Athens and Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has stepped up peace efforts on Cyprus problem since
last December.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Presidential Emissary Richard Beattie visited the island on
December 4, 1995, resulting in a document in which Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash made a shift in his position by agreeing to
support European Union membership of a federal Cyprus, provided
the sovereignty and political equality of the Turkish Cypriots
are recognized.
</P>
<P>
But the document was rejected by the Greek Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, the U.S. assistant secretary of state, has stated
that he would deal with the Cyprus problem after achieving a
solution to the Bosnian crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a recent statement, he promised to make 1996 a year of the
"big push" on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, who was said to be resigning in mid February, was
originally scheduled to visit Cyprus, Greece and Turkey between
January 23-27 but his trip was postponed for what he said the
political situation in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey militarily
intervened following an Athen-backed Greek Cypriot coup seeking
union with Greece.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The seventh Afro-Arab
Parliamentary Dialogue conference opened here today with the aim
of coordinating Arab and African stands on issues of mutual
interest.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan opened the three-day conference,
which was attended by parliament speakers and deputies from 29
Arab and African countries, including Jordan.
</P>
<P>
In his address, the king called for Afro-Arab cooperation to
solve disputes among states by peaceful means and stand firm
against those resorting to force to settle disputes.
</P>
<P>
The conference is expected to tackle the Yemen-Eritrean
conflict over three Red Sea islands.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, participants will discuss proposals to
activate Afro-Arab dialogue, tackle conflicts in Africa and
the Arab World.
</P>
<P>
They are also expected to find an appropriate mechanism to
settle disputes.

In addition, Arab parliamentarians will hold a special
session Thursday to discuss the U.S. Congress decision to move the
American embassy to Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> GSS Chief Resigns after Rabin Assassination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Israeli
General Security Services (GSS) this afternoon handed in his
resignation to Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, and the
latter accepted the resignation, Israel Television reported.
</P>
<P>
The head of GSS, known as "K," has been criticized for his role
in failing to protect the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin when
he was assassinated in Tel Aviv on November 4 last year.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Shamgar Commission of Inquiry, established to
investigate the assassination of Rabin, sent the head of GSS a
warning letter, saying that he could be harmed by testimony given
by the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Rabin's assassination, "K" had offered to
resign, but that was at the time rejected by Peres, who said that
he would not take any decision on firing "K" until the Shamgar
commission publishes its findings.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the GSS chief's attorney invited several
witnesses to appear before the Shamgar Commission, in an attempt
to clear his name, which appears to have failed.
</P>
<P>
Six other senior GSS and police officers also received warning
letters from the Shamgar Commission, and it is not known yet
whether there will be more resignations.
</P>
<P>
Rabin was shot at point-blank range by Yigal Amir, a Jewish
extremist who wanted to stop the peace process, near his car
after participating in a massive peace rally in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The Shamgar Commission has been holding a series of hearings
to investigate the first assassination of an Israeli prime
minister in the history of the State of Israel.

<HEADLINE> Canada Stresses Support for U.N. Resolution 425 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Canadian House of
Representatives Gilbert Adolph Parent reiterated here today his
country's support for the implementation of U.N. Security Council
resolution 425, which calls Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Parent, who arrived here Sunday morning, today held separate
meetings with Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri, President Elias
Hrawi and Prime Minister Rafik al Hariri, after a meeting with
Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir, spiritual leader of
Lebanon's Maronite Catholic community.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his meeting with Lebanese President Hrawi this
afternoon, Parent told reporters that "on this occasion I want to
reaffirm Canada's support for resolution 425." He added that "we
always hope that Lebanon extends its sovereignty to the southern
part of your country and enjoys independence on all its lands."
</P>
<P>
"Canada's position does not change," the Canadian speaker
noted.
</P>
<P>
On his country's stand on the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon,
Parent pointed out that Canada has accepted a number of the
Palestinian refugees from Lebanon, and stressed his country's
willingness to accept more.
</P>
<P>
But on what is taking place between the Palestinians and
Lebanon, Parent said, this issue should be decided between the
two sides, and he was optimistic that in the coming months and the
next few years good solutions will be found for all the states.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that peace will be achieved between Syria
and Israel and finally between Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"In the past years peace was established between Israel and
Egypt, now there has been an agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians, and we hope an agreement will be achieved between
Israel and Syria and Lebanon also joins them."
</P>
<P>
He said his country is trying to contribute to the Middle East
peace because "the peace here makes it easy to make the peace in
the world as a whole."
</P>
<P>
Following his talks with Berri, Parent underlined his country's
support for Lebanon's sovereignty and independence within its
internationally recognized borders.
</P>
<P>
Calling on Lebanon to attend the multilateral talks which will
be sponsored by Canada and in which the problem of Palestinian
refugees in Lebanon will be discussed, Parent said Lebanon should
not be afraid of that talks.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his country's readiness to make a serious
contribution to the finding of a solution for this problem.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are about 500,000 Palestinian
refugees living in Lebanon, most of them are residing in dozens of
refugee camps scattered all over the country.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism on the prospect of achieving peace in the
region, especially in the light of the resumption of the
Syrian-Israeli peace talks just before the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Parent also expressed his belief that progresses on the
Syrian-Israeli track will definitely reflect positively on the
Lebanese-Israeli track, in view of the "firm relations" between
Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if peace does not prevail in the Middle East
region, there will be no peace in any part of the world.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian house speaker also stressed his country's concern
on a realization of comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the
Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Teachers On Strike In Luanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Luanda's primary and high
schools closed doors today in a massive strike held by teachers
demanding higher pay and better working conditions.
</P>
<P>
The strike, to be "indefinite until teachers' demands are
met," was held in the Angolan capital on the fifth day of the new
semester.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by a general meeting of Teachers' Union
in Luanda on Saturday. Its spokesman said the strike was aimed,
among other things, at urging the authorities to approve the
regulations for teachers and pegging teachers' salaries to the
U.S. dollar amid soaring inflation.
</P>
<P>
The teachers' demands include the provisions of books to the
libraries and of equipment to the laboratories so as to improve
the working conditions of various schools.
</P>
<P>
The school teachers raised their demands to the government in
their first-ever strike held in August last year but got no
response, said a spokesman of the Teachers Union.

<P>
NICOSIA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot and Greek Agriculture
Ministers met here today to review the course of the
implementation of a Greco-Cypriot cooperation program in the
agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
According to an official press release, the two sides
expressed full satisfaction with the work done so far and the
activities taken place, especially those concerning the exchange
of experience and data in all the fields of the broad agricultural
sector.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed on the activities of the two ministries
during the first half of 1996, under a cooperation program in
agriculture signed in May 1994.
</P>
<P>
The activities concern the exchange of data, training/education
and exchange of experts in all the fields of the broad
agricultural sector such as agriculture, water resources,
veterinary services and fishery.
</P>
<P>
They also decided to work out the details of the new two-year
cooperation program to be signed later this year in Athens.
</P>
<P>
Expressing satisfaction with the course of implementing the
cooperation program, Cypriot minister Costas Petrides underlined
the significance of the cooperation program between the two

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Orders Independent Inquiry into Bugging Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Claims of National
Intelligence Agency (NIA) agents spying on top police officials
might have to referred to an independent investigator, South
Africa's First Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Pretoria, Mbeki said whether
or not this is necessary would be determined by a meeting of
security ministers and intelligence agency heads this week.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said: "we need to take a decision whether it is
exclusively a matter of an intelligence investigation or whether
it is a matter that requires independent intervention, which is
possible."
</P>
<P>
The Johannesburg-based Star newspaper last week reported the
entire top structure of the police, including National
Commissioner George Fivaz, was being spied on. It quoted unnamed
sources saying the NIA had assigned this task to Vlakplaas police
base former commander Dirk Coetzee.
</P>
<P>
However, the NIA denied it has been spying on top police
officers and that Coetzee has been assigned to such surveillance.
Coetzee himself also denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
While stressing that the allegations had to be taken
seriously, Mbeki said a commissioner might have to be appointed
to investigate them.
</P>
<P>
"Because if there is some rogue element out there, they are
not going to come to you to say 'sorry, it was me,'" he added.
</P>
<P>
The proposed meeting of security ministers and intelligence
agency heads called by Mbeki later in the week would have to
decide whether the investigation should be conducted by security
branches.
</P>
<P>
To this regard, Mbeki stressed that there has to be
cooperation between all the country's security and intelligence
services, saying this is vital to ensure that all of them,
including the police, function effectively.
</P>
<P>
"They really ought to know: who has got access to bugs? and
who is the most likely culprit if it is not the secret services
themselves?"
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the NIA ought to be lending as much support as they
could to the police to do their work, said Mbeki, adding, "if
some bug is found somewhere, it ought to be a matter of joint
consent."
</P>
<P>
The bugging case has already caused wild reactions from
political parties in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress (ANC) last week said it
questioned the veracity of the allegations, saying it was
inconceivable the NIA and police were in competition.
</P>
<P>
"Both the NIA and police remain committed to the same
objective: the defense of our democracy," the ANC said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
While the National Party said the matter was developing into a
major scandal and called for an urgent investigation by the
parliamentary committee on intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Parliament's joint standing committee on intelligence,
however, announced at the weekend it would launch its own
investigation into the allegations that the NIA is spying on top
police officers.
</P>
<P>
Committee chairwoman Lindiwe Sisulu said in terms of the
Intelligence Service Control Act, the committee could order an
investigation regarding any complaint received from a member of
the public.
</P>
<P>
"The committee is accountable to the public and requests of
this nature require it to respond," she added.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Child Welfare Institute, Home for Orphans (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Han Weicheng, who was director of the institute when Zhang
Shuyun worked there, said that Zhang had ulterior motives when
she dirted the institute's name by inventing stories. It is
astonishing that Human Rights Watch/Asia took Zhang's rumors as
news stories and spread them everywhere, although they have been
refuted by facts, He added.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that the Shanghai municipal government and other parts
of society have long paid great attention to the orphans at the
institute since the founding of new China.
</P>
<P>
The municipal budget for the institute has been increasing over
the past several years, reaching nearly six million yuan in 1995,
along with more than two million yuan donated by individuals
and institutions, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
The children with normal intelligence at the institute are sent
to nearby primary and middle schools, and, after returning to the
institute, are given further guidance in the evening to help them
cope with problems they may encounter in learning, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
In order to help the overall development of disabled orphans,
the institute set up a 2,500 sq m special school with a playground
covering 1,200 sq m and a 70-sq-m Children's Park, and provides
special education for mentally-retarded children, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Zuqing said that the children come from all parts of the
country. Sometimes boys make up the bigger proportion of children
there, sometimes girls do.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the mortality rate of the children, Shi
explained that those adopted by the institute are mostly disabled
and have severe congenital disorders or physiological defects, and
noted that, "Thanks to treatment and care provided by the
institute, the mortality rate has stood at 4 percent in recent
years."
</P>
<P>
As for the whereabouts of the children, Shi said that healthy
orphans, or those with diseases but who are able to work will
remain at the institute until adulthood, and then some will get
married and embark on a new career.
</P>
<P>
Youths above the age of 16 who have lost the ability to work
because of physiological defects will be transferred to other
welfare institutes for further care, education, and
rehabilitation, he explained.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some orphans have been adopted by families going
through proper formalities in the legal system.
</P>
<P>
Many workers at the institute who knew Zhang Shuyun expressed
indignation at Human Rights Watch/Asia in its fabrication of the
stories based on Zhang's unfounded accusations attempting to
slander the Chinese people and deceive the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
They said that fabrication and spreading of the lies hurt the
staff and workers in the institute and reveal overt hostility
towards the Chinese people.

BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Getting China's largest
shelterbelt to cover vast areas of northeast, north, and northwest
China is vital to the country's ecology and to the economic
development of central and western China to help people there
eliminate poverty.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Elections Office said
today it has sent its officers to various provinces to collect
data concerning the voters registration exercise before a
recommendation can be made to the cabinet to extend the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Director of the office Rabson Mwansa told reporters here that
election officers, who are touring the nine provinces, will give
a detailed report before the exercise closes on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We want to get a clear picture of the registration exercise
and the officers will report the actual figures prevailing before
steps concerning the extension of registration period can be
considered," Mwansa said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated only 20 percent of the eligible voters have
registered since the registration exercise began on December 12
last year. The 30-day exercise has been marred by unprecedented
apathy so far.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that his office has already made a number of
recommendations to the cabinet which has authority to decide on
the extension of the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties recently proposed to the government that
elections can only be held when an estimated 4.6 million eligible
voters are registered.
</P>
<P>
But National Secretary of the ruling Movement for Multi-Party
Democracy (mmd) Michael Sata has insisted, "We will go ahead with
elections this year when the voters registration exercise is over
whether people have registered or not."

<P>
TOKYO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of Japan's three
ruling coalition parties today formally endorsed Ryutaro Hashimoto
as their joint candidate for the post of prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, the president of the Liberal Democratic Party(LDP)
and the current trade minister, will succeed the outgoing Prime
Minister Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic
Party(SDP), who announced his resignation on January 5.
</P>
<P>
He is certain to be named in a parliamentary vote on January 11
as the new prime minister because of the coalition's solid
majority in both houses of the Diet.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, 58, will be the fifth prime minister and the first
LDP premier in two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
The LDP was ousted from power in 1993 after a series of
scandals for the first time since its founding in 1955. It
returned to the ruling camp in June 1994 after forming the current
coalition with the SDP and Sakigake with Murayama as prime

MOSCOW, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Lithuanian President Algirdas
Brazauskas rejected today resignation of Foreign Minister Povilas
Gylys and Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius, reports reaching
here said.
</P>
<P>
Instead, they were told to continue to perform their duties
pending a final decision on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers tendered their resignations last Friday to
show their dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius.
</P>
<P>
They regard as unethical the conduct of the head of the
cabinet, who, with the knowledge of the deplorable financial
status of the Lithuanian Innovations Joint-Stock Bank, withdrew
his deposits from it two days before its activities were suspended.
</P>
<P>
The incident roused a storm of indignation among hundreds of
thousands of Lithuanian citizens, who lost their savings with
crisis-ridden commercial banks of the country.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with the president today, the defense minister
told reporters that he did not withdraw his resignation petition
while the foreign minister only said that he would remain at his
post.
</P>
<P>
However, 16 other cabinet members have stated that they
disapproved of the conduct of their two colleagues and "are fully

A two-year-old girl, Tang Linping, could be seen playing on a
slide. The director, Sheng Xiaowei, said, "She has a congenital
heart disease and had an operation half a month ago. She is now
able play like normal children."
</P>
<P>
The reporters were shown the rules and regulations on the wall
of the Infant Ward. These included: "Responsibility of the Head of
the Infant Ward", "Safety and Management of Children's Living
Space", "Duty of Child-care Workers on Night Shift", and
"Responsibilities of Child-care Workers."
</P>
<P>
Zhou Zhuqing, director of the institute, said that the
institute uses these rules and regulations to instill
responsibility in child-care workers to see that orphans grow up
in a healthy way.
</P>
<P>
Zhou pointed out that anyone in the institute who leaves his
(or her) post without permission, or who beats and or scolds the
children, will be subject to severe punishment.
</P>
<P>
In one room, there was a horizontal scroll on which was
written, "Spreading love in the hearts of children." In another
room, young children were playing table tennis. When they saw a
group of foreign reporters, they were delighted and shouted,
"Foreigners!" "Foreigners!"
</P>
<P>
When "New York Times" reporter Patrick Tyler asked
five-year-old Tang Yuanqing about her name, the little girl,
dressed in green sweater and red trousers, just giggled, and
didn't answer. She playfully called the visitor "Old bear! Old
bear!" making the reporter laugh.
</P>
<P>
After an Associated Press reporter took down from the wall
several pictures painted by the girl and asked her what they were
about, she answered clearly, "They are tadpoles looking for their
mummy."
</P>
<P>
During the tour, Shi Derong, director of the Shanghai Municipal
Civil Administration who is in charge of the institute's affairs,
Zhou Zhuqing, head of the Shanghai Child Welfare Institute, and
Han Weicheng, former head of the Shanghai Child Welfare Institute,
held a two-hour question and answer session with the reporters.
</P>
<P>
During the discussion, they refuted lies that had been spread
by the New York-based Human Rights Watch/Asia. Shi said that the
Human Rights Watch/Asia report was said to have been compiled
on information and photos provided by Zhang Shuyun, a former
employee of the institute.
</P>
<P>
While working at the institute, Zhang was criticized for
violating rules of the institute. She lodged "complaints" against
Han Weicheng, the former head of the institute, and his superior,
with the slanderous accusation that Han had raped orphans, and
described the institute as a terrifying place.
</P>
<P>
After a long series of investigations, the Shanghai municipal
procuratorial body completely refuted the accusation of raping of
girl children and lies about the institute that accompanied the
accusation.

SHANGHAI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Hang Zhuang, a nine-year-old
boy who is one of 500 orphans at the Shanghai Child Welfare
Institute, when asked, says, "I have a happy life here." .
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, 20 reporters from 19 media organizations in
Britain, France, the United States, and other Western countries,
along with several Chinese correspondents, visited the institute,
in downtown Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The director of the institute and doctors and nurses there
expressed the hope that the reporters would do an objective and
just job of reporting on this government-run charity organization.
</P>
<P>
This is Shanghai's only institute that cares for orphans who
have lost their parents as the result of natural disasters or
accidents, and for handicapped and severely mentally-retarded
children or those deserted by their parents.
</P>
<P>
It is home to some 500 orphans, mostly handicapped children, and
employs 320 people, including 42 doctors and nurses, 23 teachers,
and 220 child-care workers.
</P>
<P>
Director of the institute Zhou Zhuqing, said, "We follow a
principle of supporting, treating, and educating the children,"
and explains that support focuses on ensuring sufficient nutrition
for and care of the children. A nutritionist with the institute
has worked out a diet that is suited to the children's physical
conditons and ages, in order to help their healthy growth.
</P>
<P>
For treatment, the institute has inpatient facilities and a
child rehabilitation center, which treats illnesses or sends the
children to major hospitals in downtown Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou, those children with disabilities have
rehabilitation help and orphans are given regular overall physical
check-ups.
</P>
<P>
These measures are intended to reduce the extent of deformity
of severely handicapped children and to enable
slightly-handicapped children to regain use of their limbs so that
they will be able to live and study as ordinary children in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, who is called "Mother Director" by the children, told
reporters: "You can go wherever you want to. All parts of the
institute are open to you."

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's local Business
Women's Organization is raising one million US dollars to form a
bank for the benefit of women.
</P>
<P>
"We are still raising money, although we had hiccups at first
with the banks turning away those who wanted to make a donation
toward the exercise," said Jane Mutasa, president of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
The idea was borrowed from Bangladesh, where women there were
said to have been successfully running their own bank.

<HEADLINE> Pudong New Area Gets Over 10 Million US Dollars Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong New Area, in China's
largest metropolis, set a record in 1995 by establishing on
average 2.3 Sino-foreign joint ventures and absorbing 10.9 million
U.S. dollars' worth of overseas investment daily.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, overseas investment has kept on
growing there since the area opened to the outside world in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Pudong took in a total of four billion U.S. dollars
and set up 838 foreign-funded enterprises, bringing the total
number to 3,501 enterprises and 14 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
More large projects with investments of more than 10 billion
U.S. dollars have been established here, with the number now 265
and total overseas investment, 6.61 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The investment structure has also been optimized, with tertiary
industry projects now numbering 1,900, with overseas investment of
6.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded enterprises in the area are also producing
better economic results. About a third of the 280 joint ventures
in new and high-tech industry have been put into operation,
creating a output value of 11 billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Breakthroughs have also been made in utilization of overseas
investment, including issuing stock by Sino-foreign co-operative
enterprises and joint ventures in the BOT form.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Price Hike Affects Transporters in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe road hauliers today
said the recent increase in petrol and diesel prices will add
another 2.8 million US dollars to annual fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
Transport Operators Association executive officer, Arther
Sandwith told the Zimbabwean National News Agency that it is most
likely transporters will pass on the costs to the consumers, and
many are already working out the new charges.
</P>
<P>
Fuel companies last week increased petrol and diesel prices by
just over 2.8 percent and 3.7 percent respectively, six months
after another increase in August last year following the
government budget.
</P>
<P>
He said although the fuel price hike might appear to be small,
it is, however, significant in terms of liters consumed.
</P>
<P>
Besides the increases in fuel prices, transport costs have
been rising drastically due to maintenance costs, toll fees and
labor, he added.
</P>
<P>
the rise in costs, he said, has faster than the economic
growth, reducing the operators profit margins.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The first credit card for use
with every bank was issued today in south China's Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that the Intergrated Circuit -- or IC -- card is
of great importance to China's financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The card was jointly issued by the Hainan branches of the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of
China, the People's Construction Bank of China, and the Bank of
Communications for use in a network.
</P>
<P>
Card-holders can deposit or withdraw money at designated places
in the province, or use it in designated shops or hotels.
</P>
<P>
Different from ordinary credit cards, the IC card can hold more
information and is more difficult to be forged or used by the
wrong people.
</P>
<P>
The card uses a cipher code, so that it requires no other
identification when it is used.

<HEADLINE> Drug Warlord's Army Surrenders in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The entire Mong Tai Army (MTA) of
drug warlord Khun Sa in the northeast of Myanmar has laid down its
arms and surrendered to the Myanmar government, the state-run
Radio Myanmar confirmed tonight.
</P>
<P>
The MTA in the Homong and Loilam areas in Shan state began
surrendering on January 5, said the radio report.
</P>
<P>
The official TV Myanmar also reported the surrender tonight
with footage of the scene.
</P>
<P>
The number of the surrendering MTA troops was reported to be
4,431 along with 3,483 pieces of weapons and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
No further details were available about Khun Sa himself and a
splinter group from the MTA.
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, Myanmar government troops advanced into Khun
Sa's Homong headquarters and occupied it without meeting any
resistance.
</P>
<P>
Between March and June last year, Myanmar government troops
launched two major offensives on Khun Sa's forces and captured 45
camps and three opium processing plants in eastern Shan state.
</P>
<P>
The offensives forced Khun Sa's army to withdraw from its main
strategic strongholds including the western part of Tachilek and
Mongkyut area, and cut two-thirds of its heroin production.
</P>
<P>
Last June, a split reportedly took place in Khun Sa's MTA,
which led to the resignation of Khun Sa from his posts in late
November.
</P>
<P>
Khun Sa, born in 1933 in Shan state, has been drug warlord
since the 1960s, controlling opium production in the golden
triangle where Laos, Myanmar and Thailand meet. He had later
fostered a 20,000-strong drug trafficking armed group.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested by the Myanmar government in 1969 but was
released after five years in exchange for two Russian doctors held
hostage by the drug warlord.

<HEADLINE> China to Invest Heavily in Afforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- China will invest 7.86 billion
yuan (947 million US dollars) in the third phase of the world's
largest afforestation project, Forestry Minister Xu Youfang said
here today.
</P>
<P>
"Four million ha will be covered in 13 provinces and autonomous
regions in north, northwest and northeast China during the next
five years to improve the ecology and stop water loss, soil
erosion, and desertification," he said.
</P>
<P>
"About 26.7 million ha of farmland and 20 million ha of
grassland will be protected by forest belts as a result," he said,
adding that the proposed afforestation will contribute an
additional 13 million tons of grain and 7.5 million tons of grass
to the region each year.
</P>
<P>
Projected forest coverage rate for the 13 provinces and
autonomous regions is 10 percent, compared with 8.26 percent in
1995, Xu explained. Water loss and soil erosion on 250,000 sq km
and desertification of 100,000 sq km of the northern part of the
country will be treated.
</P>
<P>
Major shelter belts will be built in three provinces in
northeast China and in eight provinces and autonomous regions in
northwest and north China, including the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region and Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
The major shelter belts are also to improve the ecology in and
around Beijing and Tianjin, two of the largest cities in China,
and to protect China's major corn-producing areas in the northeast
and to halt desertification in the Muus Desert in the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
China started construction work on a 4,480 km-long shelter belt
in 1978, known as the "Green Great Wall", in a move to combat
desertification and improve the ecology in 13 provinces and
autonomous regions, which accounts for 42 percent of the country's
total area.
</P>
<P>
The 72-year, eight-phase afforestation project (1978-2050), the
largest in the world, is also supposed to raise the forest
coverage rate for the 4.03 million sq km to 14.95 percent in 2050
from 5.05 percent in 1977.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Snow Paralyzes US East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The worst snow in 70 years
paralyzed most parts of the eastern United States today, closing
government offices, schools and airports. At least 20 deaths were
blamed on the blizzard.
</P>
<P>
The storm buried Philadelphia with 27 inches of snow and dumped
22 inches in New York City. In Washington, D.C., snow reached a
record of 18 inches. Weather forecast said parts of Pennsylvania,
New Jersey and New York expected to amass up to three feet of snow
by the end of today.
</P>
<P>
Knee-deep snow kept most of workers at home and prevented
children from going to school. Federal workers, furloughed by a
government partly shut down by a budget impasse for three weeks
and just told to head back to office two days ago, were told to
stay home for another day.
</P>
<P>
The government's Office of Personnel Management said the only
people expected to report to duty today were those needed for law
enforcement, hospitals and other emergency work.
</P>
<P>
Most state offices and schools were closed today, as were many
businesses in the region. New York City canceled classes for the
first time since 1978. The United Nations was also closed. Even
the New York Stock Exchange delayed.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report said at least 20 deaths were blamed
on the storm, thousands were left without power, and any travel --
by plane, train or automobile -- was nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
Major airports for Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Newark,
and New York City shut down and converted their waiting areas into
overnight shelters for stranded passengers.
</P>
<P>
USAir said it canceled some 1,100 flights serving airports from
Washington north to Boston Sunday. Other major carriers said they
would also canceled all flights until tomorrow morning.
</P>
<P>
Governors declared states of emergency in all or parts of
Kentucky, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, New
York, New Jersey and Delaware.
</P>
<P>
By Sunday afternoon, snow already reached 24.7 inches in
Baltimore. Weather service said there hadn't been that much snow
in the area since January 1922.
</P>
<P>
Weather service said the storm would continue dump more snow
until late today. By midday, New York City would be buried in a
record 30 inches of snow.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Visits Flood-Stricken Areas in Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
today visited the flood-stricken areas in Jakarta, where at least
five people were killed and thousands were forced to flee their
homes over the weekend in the worst flood hitting the capital in
the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Public Works Minister Radinal Moochtar,
Commander of the Jakarta Military Area Maj. Gen. Wiranto and
Jakarta Vice Governor M. Idroes, Soeharto went in a helicopter and
visited areas including Tanah Abang in central Jakarta, Kampung
Melayu and Cawang in east Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The president said that as a result of the flood, efforts
should be made to improve management of the Ciliwung river, one of
the 13 rivers running through the capital.
</P>
<P>
He urged people to help the government in combating the worst
flood in Jakarta since 1976.
</P>
<P>
The flood began pounding Jakarta last Wednesday, when
relentless torrential rains caused river banks to burst and swell
to dangerous levels.
</P>
<P>
The floodgate indicator in Depok, 30 kilometers south of
Jakarta, showed that the Ciliwung river reached an unprecedented
level of 4.35 meters last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The water in the areas along the Ciliwung river in east,
central and south Jakarta rose to more than two meters high.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Jakartans were evacuated to nearby safe shelters
such as mosques, school buildings and government offices. The
sudden flood forced most of the people to leave their belongings
behind.
</P>
<P>
Millions of residents have been affected and tens of thousands
of people have sought emergency shelters.
</P>
<P>
In the flood-stricken areas, main roads were still inundated,
which caused serious traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta Governor Surjadi Soedirdja said Sunday that this year's
floods indicated that the conditions of the city's rivers are poor
and need to be improved.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, Jakarta residents have a bad
habit of dumping wastes into the rivers, thus raising the level of
the river beds. The wastes also make it difficult for the river
water to flow into the sea.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Calls for Better Indonesian Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
today called for efforts to enhance the competitiveness of the
country's products in order to secure a due place for itself in
world trade nowadays.
</P>
<P>
He made the call when presenting the "Upakarti Presidential
Award" to outstanding businessmen who have successfully promoted
the partnership scheme with entrepreneurs of small-scale
industries.
</P>
<P>
"The country's industrial sector has to produce quality
products with higher competitiveness," he said, adding that
resources in Indonesia should be made better use of.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of the free trade era, the president stressed
that necessary preparations have to be made now.
</P>
<P>
According to Soeharto, small-scale industries in Indonesia
employ some two million people at the end of the fifth Five-Year
Development Plan, which accounted for about one percent of the
country's population.
</P>
<P>
Such a development is encouraging, but not enough, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He called on all related agencies and major businessmen to
extend assistance in the development of small-scale industries.

<HEADLINE> India Calls for Economic Cooperation Among SAARC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- India today asked the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to enhance
substantially its regional trade and economic cooperation so as to
increase its bargaining strength in the post-Uruguay Round
scenario.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao
when inaugurating a two-day SAARC trade and commerce ministers
conference here.
</P>
<P>
This has become imperative with changes in recent years which
include dwindling development assistance from the developed world,
greater integration of world economies and attempted
neo-protectionist linkages with considerations like human rights,
labor standards and environment, Rao said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister expressed his serious concern over the SAARC
countries' share in the total world trade which was even less than
one percent. Trade among SAARC nations themselves also lingered
below three percent of their total foreign trade, he added.
</P>
<P>
This compares poorly with 63.4 percent for intra-European Union
trade of its global trade in 1990, 37.3 percent for North America,
and 38.4 percent for Southeast Asia, Rao said.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his satisfaction that the process of substantial
regional economic cooperation had already begun, Rao said there
was ample evidence of a general willingness in all SAARC countries
to import from their neighbors and buy their goods.
</P>
<P>
This should impel the member states to adopt the appropriate
policy measures for promotion and facilitation of trade with one
another, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC, founded in December 1985, comprises India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives.

<HEADLINE> Peres Optimistic over Peace Talks with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Shimon Peres
said today that a "promising beginning" has been achieved in the
peace negotiations between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Peres made the comment when he was addressing an annual
luncheon of the Foreign Press Association.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether he is optimistic over the peace process
with Syria, he replied that he would lose his job if he stops
being optimistic.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister declined to say whether Israel will
have a complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights as Syria has
demanded.
</P>
<P>
He explained that he is optimistic because over the past more
or less two months, the Syrian media gave very positive reaction
to Israel's good will in searching for ways to restart the stalled
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Peres noted that the latest round of talks in Maryland, the
United States had created an atmosphere and climate which are
needed for serious negotiations. Mutual trust should come ahead of
concrete plans, he added.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday evening, Peres was briefed by members of the Israeli
delegation, who returned for consultations after the six-day new
round of talks in Wye River conference center, Maryland, some 70
miles outside Washington, in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is expected to
conduct a shuttle diplomacy between Syria and Israel this week,
apparently designed to secure more substantial results. New rounds
of Syrian-Israeli talks will follow.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the U.S. role in a possible future peace
agreement, Peres said he would not ask American soldiers to defend
Israel, but ask for a U.N. observer team, with U.S. participation,
to station on the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the forthcoming Palestinian elections, Peres said
he hopes it will be democratic, but he expressed his
understanding of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's difficulties in the
democratic experiment.
</P>
<P>
Peres dismissed a suggestion that the killing of Yihye Ayyash,
a noted Activist of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas),
would make Arafat feel uncomfortable, saying that it is Hamas
and Islamic Jihad which will feel uncomfortable.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial: China Striving For Good Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A conference on rural work held
by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) has
worked out basic plans for developing the rural economy in line
with the goals of the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), according
to an editorial by the People's Daily to be published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It will play a positive role in mobilizing the Chinese people
to work hard for a bumper harvest and creating new conditions in
rural areas this year.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, entitled "Striving For A Bumper Harvest This
Year", says that a good harvest will not only ensure an adequate
supply of farm products, but will also increase farmers' income
and curb inflation, and will lay a solid foundation for developing
agriculture to reach the goals of the Ninth Five-Year Plan.
</P>
<P>
It is important to put agriculture first in developing national
economy. Officials at various government levels should give
priority to agricultural production when making work plans or
allocating funds. They should devote most of their energy and
efforts to agriculture and rural work, says the editorial.
</P>
<P>
Governments at various levels should especially be certain that
demands in agriculture for funding and increasing of finances, and
for capital construction and loans are met. It is also necessary
that new channels for investment in agriculture be opened up.
</P>
<P>
Resolute checks should be made on the misuse of land, and the
diverting of funds, materials, and talented personnel to other
uses.
</P>
<P>
The editorial points out that China often suffers from natural
disasters, so it is important that water conservancy projects be
carried out nationwide on large scale in order to defend against
disasters better, as a means of guaranteeing good, stable yields.
</P>
<P>
While big rivers are being harnessed, more attention should
also be paid to building small water conservancy projects as well.
</P>
<P>
In order to have a good harvest this year, efforts should also
be made to popularize scientific achievements and apply them to
grain production and development of cash products.
</P>
<P>
To meet the goal, the editorial says, it is necessary to
improve leadership in agriculture and in rural work while giving
full play to farmers' initiative. And more attention should also
be paid to easing farmers' burdens.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The 41st Executive Meeting of
the State Council presided over by Premier Li Peng today discussed
and adopted two regulations in principle.
</P>
<P>
The regulations concerned use of apparatus and weapons by
Chinese police and foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
The Regulation on the Use of Apparatus and Weapons by the
Police of the People's Republic was an amended version of the
Rules on the Use of Weapons and Apparatus by the People's Police
of 1980.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations provide clear guidelines on when police can
use weapons in order to ensure better security and protection of
the Chinese people, and an effective check on illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
The Regulation on Foreign Exchange of the People's Republic of
China is intended to help the current foreign exchange system
better adjust to a market economy. The previous regulation was
made in December 1980. Experts agree that China's foreign exchange
system has seen tremendous changes during the past several
years.

<HEADLINE> UK to Strengthen Anti-Drug Cooperation with Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom and
Pakistan will strengthen their cooperation to fight against drug
production and trafficking, a visiting senior British official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the British High Commission
in Islamabad, Michael Howard, the British Secretary of State for
the Home Department, said that drug issue was one of the major
topics during his current visit.
</P>
<P>
Howard said that most of the drugs produced in Afghanistan were
transported to other parts of the world through Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Britain is one destiny of those drugs," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
So it is an international problem which needs to be solved
through international cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his visit, he held talks with Pakistani
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar,
and top officers of the Pakistani Anti-Narcotics Forces on
anti-drug cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has a long border with Afghanistan, so it is not easy
to take effective actions to curb the drug trafficking," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we hope that more will be done through the anti-drug
cooperation between the UK and Pakistan," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not say anything about how to strengthen the
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Howard started his three-day visit to Pakistan from Saturday,
which concentrated on drug-related issues and immigration matters.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Howard was so tight-lipped that he did
not answer a single question about the immigration directly.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Head of State Visits Buddhist Holy Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Senior General Than Shwe,
chairman of the State Law and Order Restoration Council of the
Union of Myanmar, and his party paid respect to a sacred Buddhist
relic here today.
</P>
<P>
The relic is one of two teeth left after the death of
Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism, and is highly revered by
Buddhists and worshipped at Lingguang Temple in the western
suburbs of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Following the Buddhist practices of Myanmar, Than Shwe and his
party showed their devotion and presented a jasaya, a patchwork
outer vest worn by Buddhist monks, to the master who looks after
the tooth.
</P>
<P>
In return, the master presented Than Shwe with a gold image of
the Goddess of Mercy and wished his country rich, strong and
prosperous. Than Shwe expressed his pleasure upon receiving the
gift, saying that his wishes will be realized.
</P>
<P>
Over 85 percent of the people of Myanmar believe in Buddhism,

<HEADLINE> US Willing to Join Peace Monitors on Golan Heights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry said here today that Washington will be willing to
participate in a peace monitoring force on the Golan Heights if
Israel and Syria reach a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Perry made the statement after meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres, who also holds the post of defense
minister, in Jerusalem this morning.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria during the 1967
Middle East war, and the Knesset (Israel's parliament) passed a
law in 1981 to annex the heights.
</P>
<P>
At the previous peace negotiations with Israel, Syria said
that Israel must fully withdraw from the Golan Heights before any
peace agreement could be reached between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel insisted on full normalization of relations and
security arrangements as a priority, saying that the depth of
withdrawal would reflect the depth of peace.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Peres, Perry also announced that
the U.S. will provide Israel with 200 million U.S. dollars over
the next five years to help fund the 500-million-dollar Arrow
Anti-Missile project.
</P>
<P>
Perry arrived here this morning from Amman, capital of Jordan,
as part of a Middle East tour, which also took him to Saudi
Arabia and Oman, and is scheduled to leave Israel later today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will
arrive in the region on Wednesday at the start of a new round of
shuttle between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
During his 16th visit to the Middle East, Christopher will
discuss with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and Israeli Prime
Minister Peres about the results of the Israeli-Syrian
negotiations held in the U.S. over the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria held two rounds of talks in Wye River
conference center, Maryland, and both sides said that there was a
warmer atmosphere in the negotiations, though no agreements had
been reached so far.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said that Christopher's visit will likely
lead to further negotiations between Israel and Syria at the end
of this month, aimed at pushing forward the peace process between
the two countries.

<HEADLINE> World Food Program Brings Food Relief to Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
has brought more than 2,000 tons of wheat and flour to Kabul,
capital of Afghanistan, in relief supplies to the country, reports
reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted WFP officials as saying today that the food
brought by a truck convoy arranged by WFP arrived in the besieged
Kabul Saturday.
</P>
<P>
UN officials earlier warned that without additional relief
supplies, some one million Kabul residents could face starvation
with the onset of winter's bitter weather.
</P>
<P>
The consignment will be used in about 100 WFP-subsidized
bakeries to produce bread for around 170,000 Kabulis, they said.
</P>
<P>
The WFP is also arranging food and medical supplies for
hospital patients, children and orphans, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The agency also plans to start bringing more than 1,000 tons of
wheat and flour per week in the near future.
</P>
<P>
This was the single largest delivery of supplies into Kabul,
which has been isolated by the Taliban student militia since last
October.
</P>
<P>
All but one routes leading to Kabul have been cut off by the
rivals of Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani. The rivals are
demanding that Rabbani step down and an interim neutral government
be set up.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
today paid glowing tribute to what he called the outstanding
achievements of former French President Francois Mitterrand, who
died earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand made an "outstanding contribution to public life
throughout the post-war period and he would be remembered long

"He faced very serious illness with exceptional courage and
dignity" and he will be mourned by friends and admirers around the
world, Major added.
</P>
<P>
Major's predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, has also reportedly
praised Mitterrand, saying she "liked and respected" him although

a life-long Socialist.
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand, who stepped down as president last May, had been
suffering from prostate cancer and died this morning at the age of
79. He came to power in 1981 and won a second seven-year term in

<HEADLINE> UK Treasury Uneasy over Sacking of Stock Exchange Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- British Treasury ministers have
expressed uneasiness over the sacking of Michael Lawrence, chief
executive of the London Stock Exchange (LSE), and concern that the
resulting upheaval will slow the pace of change in the market.
</P>
<P>
Both ministers and civil servants were reportedly uneasy at the
timing and manner of Lawrence's dismissal last week and the
implications for trading and other reforms.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury is believed to have been taken by surprise by
Lawrence's abrupt departure and is hoping that Ian Plenderleith,
the Bank of England executive director and the LSE's new joint
deputy chairman, will maintain the pressure for change.
</P>
<P>
One Whitehall source said "the question is whether the Stock
Exchange is going to get on with the changes he (Lawrence) had in
mind or whether the forces of darkness will play them into the
long grass".
</P>
<P>
The Treasury is also said to be furious at speculation that it
was involved in seeking Lawrence's dismissal because of an
"insider-trading" row over last year's sale of shares in
electricity generators National Power and PowerGen.
</P>
<P>
The Exchange will try to find a replacement for Lawrence this
week and publish a consultation document on the new trading system
due to start in August.
</P>
<P>
Reforms to create an order-driven, fully electronic share
trading system was one of Lawrence's priorities but he was
criticized for trying to drive reform too hard with too little
consultation.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence, 52, became the LSE's chief executive in February
1994. He was forced to resign last Thursday after "a loss of
confidence in him".
</P>
<P>
John Kemp-Welch, chairman of the LSE, denied Lawrence was a
scapegoat for controversies last year, including the move toward
order-driven trading which met strong opposition from LSE members
and was described by a senior executive as the real reason behind
Lawrence's departure.

<HEADLINE> Thai Rubber Exports May Benefit From Tariff Cut in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand, one of the world's
largest rubber producers and exporters, may benefit from China's
planned tariff cut on rubber imports, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to slash tariffs on rubber imports this year.
</P>
<P>
Rubber prices in Thailand would remain over 30 baht (1.2
U.S. dollars) per kilogram until March, the Agriculture
Department's Rubber Research Institute said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government guarantees a rubber price of 25 baht (1
dollar) per kilogram and intervenes if the price slips below
that.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the rubber market in Thailand remains healthy
despite traditionally sluggish trade in December and January every
year and the rubber price is still at 35 baht (1.4 dollars) per
kilogram, the institute noted.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Postpones Polling Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi Election
Commission (EC) today once again postponed the date of the coming
general elections to February 15 from February 7.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here today, the EC said that it has
rescheduled the polling date through an amendment of the earlier
schedule in view of the written and verbal requests it had
received from major political parties.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised schedule, the last date for submitting
nomination papers to the returning or assistant returning officers
has been fixed on January 17 and the last date for the withdrawal
of candidature on January 23.
</P>
<P>
Nomination papers will be scrutinized on January 18.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time that the EC has rescheduled the polls
since last December 3 when it first announced a polling schedule
of January 18.
</P>
<P>
Not long after the announcement, it shifted the polling date to
February 7 because the government and the opposition parties could
not reach agreement over the issue of forming a neutral caretaker
government under which the general elections will be held.
</P>
<P>
With the opposition continuing to boycott the polling process,
the EC had to partially revise the schedule on January 3 by
shifting the last date for filling of nomination papers from
January 3 to 8 and changing the last date for withdrawal of
nomination papers to January 9-14 from January 4-9.
</P>
<P>
The polling reschedules have still been rejected by the
opposition parties who are demanding the resignation of Prime
Minister Begum Khaleda Zia to pave the way for a neutral caretaker
government to supervise the upcoming polls.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties staged a fresh nationwide strike from
early this morning to press for their demand.

<P>
BEIRUT, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Canadian House of
Representatives Gilbert Parent stressed here today that his
country supports Lebanon's sovereignty and independence within its
internationally recognized borders.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized Canada's support of the implementation of
U.N. Security Resolution 425, which calls for an Israeli
withdrawal from all the Lebanese territories.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after holding talks with Lebanese House
Speaker Nabih Berri in the Parliamentary Building, Parent pointed
out that the problem of Palestinians in Lebanon can be resolved
through negotiations between parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian house speaker arrived in Beirut Sunday on a visit
to Lebanon, during which he will hold talks with Lebanese
political and religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
Calling on Lebanon to attend the multilateral talks which will
be sponsored by Canada and in which the problem of Palestinian
refugees in Lebanon will be discussed, Parent underlined that
Lebanon should not be afraid of that talks.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his country's readiness to make a serious
contribution for seeking a solution to this problem.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are about 500,000 Palestinian
refugees living in Lebanon, most of whom are residing in dozens of
refugee camps scattered all over the country.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian house speaker said that he conveyed to Lebanese
officials his country's concern about what is happening in Lebanon
and in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He expressed a "big" optimism on the prospect of achieving a
peace agreement in the region, especially in the light of the
resumption of the Syrian-Israeli peace talks just before the end
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Parent also expressed his belief that progress in the
Syrian-Israeli peace talks will lead to progress on the Lebanese
track of peace talks, in view of the "firm relations" between
Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if a peace does not prevail in the Middle East
region, there will be no peace in any part of the world.
</P>
<P>
Parent held a meeting earlier today with Lebanese Maronite
Patriarch Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir, the spiritual leader of
Lebanon's Maronite Catholic community.

<HEADLINE> Guinea Won't Replace Nigeria in Africa Nations' Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Guinea's ambassador to Egypt said
here on Monday his country will not replace Nigeria to take part
in the Africa Nations' Cup.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Issiaga Kourouma said Guinea's refusal came because its
national team had no time to prepare.
</P>
<P>
Kourouma said he would inform the Cairo-based Confederation of
African Football (CAF) of his country's decision later.
</P>
<P>
CAF spokesman Viken Djizmedjian said the tournament organisers
would hold meetings in Johannesburg on Monday and Tuesday to
discuss whether to call for a second replacement team.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria announced last week that his country withdrew from the
tournament because of fears that players could be in danger in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
CAF said in a statement on last Friday that its organising and
executive committees would decide later this month what sanctions
they would impose on Nigeria.

<P>
HONG KONG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Despite a slight increase in
overall crime cases last year, Hong Kong remained one of the
safest cities in the world, a senior Hong Kong police official
said today.
</P>
<P>
Hui Ki-on, the commissioner of the police, told a press
conference that the number of overall crime cases rose by 4.6
percent to 91,886 last year, but the rise was mainly attributable
to increases in woundings, various thefts and detected narcotics
cases.
</P>
<P>
He said that the crime detection rate in Hong Kong remained
steady at 52 percent which is very high by international
standards.
</P>
<P>
Hui said it was most encouraging to see a decrease in violent
crime cases, especially robberies involving genuine firearms and
pistol-like objects, which dropped significantly by 35.7 percent
and 11.6 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
He added that the local police force will make greater efforts
to fight against various crimes.

<HEADLINE> Thai Treasure-Hunters to Quit Digging for Gold Bars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A Thai official said today that
excavators would stop their search Tuesday for treasures and gold
bars believed to be left behind by Japanese soldiers during World
War II in west Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Intensive digging in the past three weeks in a forest in
Kanchanaburi province, west Thailand, has unearthed nothing of any
significant value.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Education Minister Chaovarin Latthasaksiri, who had all
along supported the digging, told reporters today that if there
was still no sign of gold, he would withdraw his support.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Chaovarin's secretary told reporters that the deputy
minister had been shown "irrefutable proofs" of the existence of
the treasures in the province by the manager of a fortune-hunting
company.
</P>
<P>
In the course of the digging, police have arrested several
fortune-hunters on charges of damaging forest reserves.
</P>
<P>
In World War II, Japanese aggressor troops made allied
prisoners of war and Asian laborers build a railway, now known as
"the death railway," in Kanchanaburi to link up Siam (Thailand)
with Burma (Myanmar) to transport war materials at the expense of
thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
Rumors surface from time to time that Japanese soldiers buried
their booty in the forest at the time of their withdrawal, in the
hope that they could come back to claim it later.

<HEADLINE> Central Rural Conference Outlines Major Tasks for 1996-2000 (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
-- Stabilize and improve the Party's rural policies, deepen
agricultural reform and speed up the pace of opening up of
agricultural sector;
</P>
<P>
-- Transform agricultural growth model, and developing
high-yield, high-quality, low-consumption and high-efficiency
agriculture;
</P>
<P>
-- Input more into the aid-the-poor projects. The central
government has decided to increase one billion yuan of discounted
loans for poverty-relieving annually in the next five years; and
</P>
<P>
-- Work for the sustainable development of agriculture by
sternly controlling on population increase, protecting arable land
and ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
The conference acknowledged that it is an arduous task to
fulfil the target set for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to the grand plan set for the year 2000, the country
will register total grain output of some 490 billion to 500
billion kg, ensure farmers to lead a fairly comfortable life and
help 70 million poor farmers overcome poverty.
</P>
<P>
The conference also noted that there are some favorable factors
for the country's agricultural development in the coming few years.
</P>
<P>
The food consumption demand for the 1.2 billion population, the
rapid growth of the industrial and service sectors all form a
strong driving force for agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
The historic experience show that the production of
agricultural products always has its ebbs and tides, the
conference said. The country's current grain production is just in
a period of fluctuations and is carrying with itself seeds of new
and further development.
</P>
<P>
China has a great potential for the development of agricultural
resources and scientific utilization in the sector, the conference
said.
</P>
<P>
The reform in grains purchase and sale mechanism and the rising
in grain and cotton prices have aroused the farmers' enthusiasm
for the growing of food grains.
</P>
<P>
The conference called for the relevant departments to utilize
current favorable conditions to fulfil the target set in the ninth
Five-Year-Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The major tasks in the agricultural sector this year is to
accelerate paces of construction of arable land and water
conservancy projects and to stabilize cereals growing acreage at
110 million ha and cotton planting acreage at six million ha.
</P>
<P>
Also, a batch of advanced and practical agricultural techniques
will be further spread and the pace of forestry construction
speeded up.
</P>
<P>
Among others, problems such as relatively low grain prices,
methods concerning supply and marketing of chemical fertilizers
and heavy burdens on farmers, are expected to be listed higher on
this year's agricultural agenda and coped with conscientiously.

<HEADLINE> Senior Official Urges Development of Legal Science Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior official today urged
the country's law workers to step up reforms to promote legal
science education with the cultivation of a large number of
capable personnel well versed in the law.
</P>
<P>
"Being an important component of the national education system,
legal science education must be boosted at a faster speed to
contribute to the establishment of a modern socialist nation with
a sound legal system," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Ren Jianxin, a member of the secretariat of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee and secretary of the Political
Science and Law Committee under the CPC Central Committee, made
the remarks at a national conference on legal science education
which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference is China's first national one since the
country's law-enforcement departments were restored in 1979.
</P>
<P>
"The shift from the traditional planned economy to a socialist
market economy makes it imperative that the country be managed in
accordance with the law," Ren said, adding that legal personnel
are badly needed in judicial, legislative and executive
departments, and institutions specializing in legal services and
supervision.
</P>
<P>
According to sources at the Ministry of Justice, China has
formed a legal science education system connected with university
and college schooling, adult education and occupational training.

Over the past 16 years, some 160 higher-learning institutions
or departments of legal science education have been set up or
restored across the country. Besides, there are 29 correspondence
centers and 200 sub-centers for providing knowledge of the law.
</P>
<P>
However, statistics show that by the end of 1994 Chinese
university and college students studying legal science accounted
for only 2.2 percent of all students. Among current lawyers, 25
percent have a bachelor's degree and only 1.49 percent hold a
master's degree.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Yang, minister of Justice, said today that in the coming

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific Semiconductor Market Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The semiconductor market in
the Asia-Pacific region expanded by a strong 41 percent last year,
with the manufacturers overtaking their American and European
counterparts in terms of revenue growth, according to industrial
sources here today.
</P>
<P>
They said that the total revenue for the year was 33.5 billion
US dollars, while the region increased its share of world-wide
consumption to a best-ever 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
Citing figures from research group Dataquest Inc., the sources
noted that what was particularly impressive was the performance of
companies originating from the Asia-Pacific, excluding those from
Japan.
</P>
<P>
World-wide revenues of these companies, especially the
manufacturers of the Dynamic Random Access Memory from South
Korea, grew by a sizzling 84.2 percent, they said.
</P>
<P>
This was more than double the average revenue growth rates of
companies from North America, Japan, and Europe respectively, they
said.
</P>
<P>
They added that the figures helped confirm the Asia-Pacific's
position as the most dynamic region for semiconductor production
and consumption world-wide.
</P>
<P>
North American semiconductor companies registered a revenue
growth of 36.6 percent in the 1994-95 period, while Japanese
companies recorded a revenue growth of 37. 6 percent, and European
companies, 35.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The world-wide share of Asia-Pacific semiconductor companies
has risen from under 4 percent in 1990 to 6 percent in 1992, and
to 12 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
North American and Japanese companies still dominate the market
with about 40 percent each, though the Japanese have seen their
market share shrinking steadily from 46 percent in 1990, while the
American share came down from 43 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
European companies have suffered most in terms of the market
share, as theirs has fallen from 11.2 percent in 1990 to 8.6
percent last year, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> China Donates Relief Goods to Afghan Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 8 (Xinhua) -- China today donated relief
goods worth 3.5 million yuan (about 420,000 US dollars) to the
repatriated Afghan refugees, a Chinese diplomat said at a
handing-over ceremony here.
</P>
<P>
Fu Guangting, the Economic and Commercial Counselor of the
Chinese embassy in Pakistan, said that the donation, composed of
medicines, woolen blankets, tea and fire extinguishers, should be
transferred to Afghan people as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people are deeply concerned over
the situation in Afghanistan and the plight of the refugees and
the displaced persons in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope for the early realization of
Afghanistan's reconciliation, which, he said, would contribute to
the resettlement of the refugees and the reconstruction of the
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The donation was made under the Notes exchanged on June 28 and
August 10, 1995, between the Chinese government and the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
Anoushiravan Daneshvar, deputy chief of the UNHCR Mission for
Afghanistan, said at the ceremony that the Chinese relief goods
already arrived in Peshawar, Pakistan, and were received and
checked by the UNHCR Peshawar office.
</P>
<P>
Daneshvar said that China was the only donor that aided Afghan
refugees in kind since the beginning of last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the current donation would mainly be used in the
Jalalabad area of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistan and Iran had received altogether about
six million Afghan refugees during the Afghan war.
</P>
<P>
"Presently, about 65 percent of the refugees have been
repatriated," he said.
</P>
<P>
On December 24, 1995, China donated relief goods worth 1.5
million yuan (about 180,000 US dollars) to Afghan refugees
residing in Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Share Prices Continue to Surge Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- After last week's rally, share
prices continued to surge higher on the Singapore market, as the
benchmark Straits Times Industrials (STI) index picked up by
another 20.34 points to close at 2,385.87 today.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume was 354.12 million units, valued at
718.8 million Singapore dollars (some 502.66 million US dollars).
Rises overwhelmed falls by 336 to 50, while 137 other counters
remained steady from last week.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the local market was expected to stay
firm this week although the powerful New Year rally could be
checked by sporadic profit-taking. They said that the STI index
could reach the 2400 level this week.
</P>
<P>
The STI index gained almost 100 points last week, as foreign
fund managers returned from holidays to buy up stocks against the
backdrop of strong economic fundamentals of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Berjaya Group was the most actively traded counter, chalking up
a turnover of 12.82 million units. MCB was next with 9.68 million
of its shares traded, while IPC saw 8.88 million of its shares

<TEXT>

KUALA LUMPUR, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Kuala Terengganu and Marang
in Malaysia's Terengganu state have been declared rabies control
areas by the country's veterinary authorities, the Bernama news
agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Bernama quoted Ibrahim Embong, an official at the veterinary
services department, as saying that the move was taken after some
residents in both districts were attacked by dogs feared to be
rabid.
</P>
<P>
The gazette notification, which was signed today, would allow
the department to take steps to destroy stray dogs in both
districts.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim said the cause of the disease could not be confirmed,
but he believed the rabies virus could have originated from dogs
used in wild boar hunts.
</P>
<P>
The disease could be spread among the population if it was not
checked, Ibrahim said, adding that one case had been detected in
Kuala Terengganu after a housewife was bitten by a dog last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, three children in Marang were admitted to hospital
after being bitten by a rabid dog, Bernama said.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Latest Cabinet Reshuffle Planned since Last Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
revealed that he had planned the latest cabinet reshuffle since
last summer.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Mayo, mouthpiece of the ruling National
Democratic Party (NDP), Mubarak said that he had been tight-lipped
about the plan lest "the national course of action should be
negatively affected."
</P>
<P>
The interview was published today in the weekly newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet shift is aimed at streamlining Egypt's political
life and coping with world developments, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak appointed Kamal el-Ganzouri as the prime minister to
form a new cabinet last Tuesday following the resignation of
former Prime Minister Atef Sedki's government.
</P>
<P>
The move came as a surprise since Mubarak had said after the
parliamentary elections last month that he saw no need for major
cabinet changes.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle is believed to have been aimed at quickening the
pace of the country's faltering economic reform and reshaping the
image of the government, which has been accused by opposition
parties of widespread vote rigging in the parliamentary elections,
in which the NDP claimed a landslide victory.
</P>
<P>
Three portfolios related to economy -- finance, economy and
industry -- changed hands, further indicating that the new
government would aim to achieve more rapid economic development.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri, who also serves as the planning minister, said
Saturday at a cabinet meeting that the new government would try to
double the current economic growth rate to exceed that of the
population growth, create job opportunities, increase exports and
attract more investments in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Mubarak also said that a large-scale
reshuffle of provincial governors will be announced in the second
half of this month.
</P>
<P>
He added that an assessment of the performance of governors is
currently underway.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, however, said that there will be no changes in the
leadership of the NDP at present.

<HEADLINE> Comprehensive and Just Peace Means Ending Israeli Occupation: Hrawi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
called here today for an Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon,
saying this is demanded by U.N. Security Council resolution 425
and enjoined by a comprehensive and just peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
At an annual new year reception of foreign ambassadors and
envoys in Lebanon in the Presidential Palace, the Lebanese
president announced that his country is on the road of a
"honorable" peace and is seeking an end of the Israeli occupation
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We are on the road of a honorable peace," the President said.
"We want to end the Israeli occupation in the south and Western
Bekaa till we regain our right on territory and sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
"This is provided for by the resolution 425, and this is what a
comprehensive and just peace means," Hrawi stressed in his speech.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country is against any peace settlement which
is at the expense of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi reiterated a Lebanese promise that it will guarantee
security on the border with Israel once the Jewish state pulls its
forces out of the occupied strip in the south, which is
self-proclaimed by Israel as the "security zone."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized a special relationship with Syria which is based
on "understanding, cooperation and coordination."
</P>
<P>
He also underlined inseparability of the Lebanese and Syrian
tracks of peace talks with Israel, pointing out that coordination
of the two tracks is "our firm decision and a guarantee for the
realization of a comprehensive and just peace."
</P>
<P>
Hrawi repeated Lebanon's refusal to resettle Palestinian
refugees in this country. "Our constitution stipulates 'no
resettlement,'" and all the Lebanese refuse the resettlement, the
president said, adding that the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon
also want to return to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
He called for an early release of Lebanese prisoners jailed by
Israel, and a dismantle of all mass-destruction weapons in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese president urged the United States to lift a
travel ban on the American citizens to Lebanon, thus to reopen the
airways between the two countries and to enable "American
airliners to land at our airport and Lebanese airliners to land at
American airports."
</P>
<P>
The travel ban was imposed by the U.S. administration
following a series of attacks against American interests in Beirut
in the middle of the 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Chretien Goes to Asia to Open New Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 8 (xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien is heading for Asia today on an 11-day trade mission to
India, Pakistan, Indonesia and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
It is his second visit to Asia since November 1994 when he
visited China and other Asian countries and regions. During that
trip the Canadian delegation signed with China 8.6 billion
Canadian dollars (some 6.3 billion U.S. dollars) worth of
contracts, memorandums and letters of intent.
</P>
<P>
Chretien will try a "Team Canada" approach to trade promotion
this time as he did in China a year ago. Seven provincial premiers
and more than 300 businessmen will accompany him in the visit.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to sign at least 2 billion Canadian dollars
(some 1.5 billion U.S. dollars) worth of agreements on
telecommunications, transportation, energy and environmental and
financial services, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Among the four countries which have a total population of 1.15
billion and great trade potentials, Indonesia is Canada's largest
export market, which imported 475 million Canadian dollars (about
351.5 million U.S. dollars) worth of goods and services from
Canada in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Canada's trade volume with Malaysia hit 1.5 billion Canadian
dollars (some 1.1 billion U.S. dollars) in 1994 but Canadian
exports to the country accounted for only 291.5 million dollars
(about 215.7 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Canada's exports to India totaled 316 million Canadian
dollars (some 233.8 million U.S. dollars) in the first half of
1995. Its investments in India reached 151 million Canadian
dollars (about 111.7 million U.S. dollars) in the first half of
last year, an eightfold increase over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of bilateral trade between Canada and Pakistan
is relatively small. But a certain number of Canadian companies
are being involved in projects such as power projects and
rapid-transit system in Karachi worth billions of Canadian dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to Canadian Minister for International Trade Roy
MacLaren, the Asia-Pacific region will play an important role in
the economic future of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Chretien's Asian visit will bear a great significance since
Canada's economic growth slowed in 1995 due to high interest
rates, consumers' low confidence and feeble domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Canada is expected to achieve more than 2.2 percent of
economic growth in 1995 and its exceptional performance in
foreign markets is believed to have played an important role in
the growth.
</P>
<P>
The visit is also seen as a government effort to reestablish
its focus on economic development and job creation rather than on
national unity. The October-30 referendum on Quebec separation
last year turned public attention to national unity and had a
negative impact on the economy.

ANKARA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish parliament will open
this afternoon with a marathon swearing-in ceremony expected to
last at least 18 hours with each of the 550 newly-elected deputies
walking up to the rostrum and declaring their allegiance to the
unity of the republic.
</P>
<P>
The deputies are also expected to declare their respect for the

</P>
<P>

parliament speaker within 102 days.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the new legislative term of the parliament will
start at 2 p.m. at Ataturk's Mausoleum.

President Suleyman Demirel will attend the swearing-in
ceremony, but reportedly will not deliver a speech during the

</P>
<P>
Demirel will meet with five political party leaders Tuesday to
discuss the formation of the new government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the political parties are continuing their efforts
regarding the formation. RP Deputy Chairman Recai Kutan told a

In response to reports that the president would not give the
assignment to the RP, Kutan said his party had written to the
office of the president for clarification of this issue and that

<HEADLINE> Sino-Myanmar Ties Can Be Rated as Example: CPPCC Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, said here today that Sino-Myanmar ties can be rated as
a good example of good-neighborly relations.
</P>
<P>
Li described as "of historic significance" the ongoing visit to
China by Senior General Than Shwe, chairman of the State Law and
Order Restoration Council of the Union of Myanmar, and predicted
that the visit will open up a new chapter in Sino-Myanmar
relations.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Than Shwe at the Great Hall of the
People at noon today, Li said that China and Myanmar are close
neighbors joined by rivers, mountains and roads, and share
long-standing friendly ties.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Myanmar relations have been "very good" and the two
countries have respected, understood, supported and learned
from each other all these years, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
Now both countries face the common task of accelerating
economic development and improving their peoples' living
standards, the CPPCC chairman said.
</P>
<P>
"Myanmar boasts rich resources, a correct policy, strong and
effective leadership and hard-working people, and has broad
prospects for development," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Noting the strong complementarity between the two economies and
their co-operation potential, Li expressed the hope that bilateral
exchanges and co-operation would be raised to a new height.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe echoed Li's view on bilateral economic
collaboration. He voiced the hope that his visit would bring new
results to the deepening of bilateral economic co-operation.
</P>
<P>
The friendship and co-operation between the two countries is of
great significance to the stability and development of this
region, Than Shwe added.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the CPPCC chairman hosted a banquet in honor
of the Myanmar visitors.

<P>
Than Shwe said that Myanmar was encouraged by the great
economic achievements China has made in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the satisfactory development of bilateral ties to
the profound friendship between senior leaders of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He told Jiang that the main purpose of his visit is to
strengthen the bilateral ties, as well as to learn from China's
experience in developing its economy.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe noted that his country would like to further expand
the relations of mutual benefit and co-operation between the two
countries, adding that the stable political situation and
developing economy of Myanmar have helped to pave the way for the
expansion of the two-way trade.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence
and the 10 Principles set forth at the Bandung Conference, Myanmar
will positively involve in the stability, peace and development in
the region and strive to promote its ties of friendship with its
neighbors in Southeast Asia and in the world at large, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China is very glad to see the achievements Myanmar
has made over recent years in stabilizing its political situation,
realizing national reconciliation, developing its economy,
upholding its traditional culture and expanding ties with other
countries.
</P>
<P>
China would like to increase its friendly co-operation with
Myanmar in various fields, Jiang said. China will continue to
encourage its enterprises to conduct mutually beneficial
co-operation with Myanmar so as to promote the two-way trade to a
new stage.
</P>
<P>
Jiang spoke highly of Myanmar's positive and independent
foreign policy. He noted that China would like to enhance
discussions with Myanmar on international and regional affairs in
order to safeguard the peace and stability in the region and the
interests and rights of the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Jiang and Than Shwe participated in a signing
ceremony for three Sino-Myanmarese co-operative documents -- a
bilateral co-operation agreement on economy and technology, an
agreement on the Chinese government's supply of loans to the
Myanmar government, and an agreement on bilateral cultural
co-operation.

<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said here
today that the Sino-Myanmar good-neighborly and friendly ties have
great vitality and bright prospects.
</P>
<P>
He made this remark during his talks with visiting Senior
General Than Shwe, chairman of the State Law and Order Restoration
Council of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe arrived here Sunday for a one-week official goodwill
visit to China at the invitation of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
During today's talks Jiang expressed his convinction that the
current visit by Than Shwe would push the bilateral friendly ties
to a still higher level.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is both a good neighbor of China and one of the
countries which had established diplomatic relations with China at
an early stage, Jiang said, adding that the Five Principles of
Peaceful Co-Existence initiated by the two countries in the 1950s
have made great contributions to safeguarding peace and stability
in the world, as well as setting a good example for peaceful and
friendly coexistence among neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he noted, although the international situation
has changed dramatically, bilateral ties have enjoyed smooth and
stable development, exchanges of high-level visits have been
maintained, and fruitful exchanges and co-operation have been
conducted in the fields of politics, economy and trade, as well as
culture.
</P>
<P>
The 46 years after the forging of diplomatic ties between the
two countries have proved that the bilateral friendly ties, on the
basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence, have great
vitality and prospects, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that furthering such ties complies with the interests
of the two countries and will be beneficial to peace and stability
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his appreciation for Myanmar's adherence to the
one-China policy.

<HEADLINE> Peres: Syria Agrees on Principle of Peace with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres said here Sunday night that Syria has agreed that peace
between Israel and the rest of the Arab countries should be the
aim of the current negotiations between Israel and Syria,
according to local media reports today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Israel Bond Rabbis Conference in Jerusalem,
Peres said that there was a warmer atmosphere in the peace
negotiations with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
"In our judgment," said Peres, "the Syrians accepted the
principle to see a possible peace agreement with Israel has an
attempt to make it a comprehensive peace between Israel and the
rest of the Arab countries."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Israeli-Syrian negotiations held in
the U.S. over the past weeks had been conducted in "a different
opening" and "more informal" way.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Peres was briefed by the Israeli negotiation team on
the two rounds of negotiations between Israel and Syria held in
Maryland, the U.S., during the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli negotiation team, headed by Uri Savir,
director-general of the foreign ministry and peace process
coordinator, returned from the U.S. to Israel Sunday afternoon to
report to Peres and the government on the results of the talks
with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria resumed their peace negotiations on December
27 last year, and talks were held at the Wye River Conference
Center in Maryland, as an effort to avoid press disturbing.
</P>
<P>
The first three days of talks ended on December 29, and the two
sides agreed to an American suggestion that they remain in the
U.S. during the long New Year weekend to continue informal
contacts.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is scheduled to
arrive in the region Wednesday for another diplomatic shuttle
between Israel and Syria, joined with the Israeli and Syrian
negotiators in the second three days of talks which started last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media said that Christopher's visit will likely lead
to further Israeli-Syrian negotiations at the end of this month.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar President Urges Cooperation From  Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar President Salmin
Amour has asked the representatives from the opposition camp in
the legislature to cooperate with the government in hastening
development of the isles and their people.
</P>
<P>
He said this in Chake Chake, Pemba, on Sunday when addressing
his maiden rally since the last October Zanzibar multi-party
general elections, said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The rally was organized by the ruling Revolutionary Party
(CCM) members in Pemba to congratulate Amour on his election
victory.
</P>
<P>
Though the CCM won the general elections in Zanzibar, it lost
all the 21 seats of Pemba in the House of Representatives to the
Civic United Front (CUF). CUF has not yet recognized the results
of the elections so far, saying "the election has been rigged".
</P>
<P>
President Amour said there is no reason for the
representatives to show discontent to the government, instead
they should cooperate to work for development and to serve the
people better.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed the need to respect the multi-party
democracy and the rule of law instead of planting seeds of
divisions, hatred and confrontation, saying the election results
of the last polls reflected the will of Zanzibar people.
</P>
<P>
He said that Unguja and Pemba would remain part and parcel of
the whole Zanzibar. His government would treat people of both
islands equally and fairly, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president pledged the government's commitment to bring
balanced social and economic development in Unguja and Pemba.

KAMPALA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan People's Defense

violated Ugandan territory, the local newspaper "the Monitor"

Edison Muzoora, the UPDF Brigade Commander based in Kitgum in

<P>
The report claimed that Sudanese bombers constantly flew

<P>
Relations between Uganda and the Sudan have been bumpy since

Enlai (March 5, 1898--January 8, 1976).
</P>

The gathering was held at the Meiyuan New Village, where from

government until the Kuomintang authorities launched an all-out

<HEADLINE> Certificates a Must for Peasants to Contract Fields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- In the countryside of the
Pudong New Area of this, China's biggest city a new regulation
stipulates that without a special certificate, peasants are not
allowed to contract fields.
</P>
<P>
The certificate is offered by the regional agricultural organs
to peasants who have finished a three-month training course.
</P>
<P>
The training course offers five subjects: basic agriculture,
modern agriculture, marketing, economic policy and professional
ethics.
</P>
<P>
Wang Fuyao, a farmer from east China's Zhejiang Province, has
applied to the Tangzhen Village authorities to contract 30 ha of
land next year, attributing his confidence to the knowledge he
learned in the training course.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Genchu, deputy head of the village, said, "The Pudong New
Area will not only be developed into a modern city, but also one
with modern agriculture. We are making efforts to let every
peasant know that experience alone is far from enough to be a
modern farmer."
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, the new regulation has proved to be feasible
and has received a positive response from the peasants. To date,
more than 20 peasants have applied for the next training course,
which is scheduled to start soon.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM Accuses Syria of Sheltering Rebel PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Deniz
Baykal accused Syria of "harboring terrorists," who often
infiltrate into the Turkish territories to attack various targets,
the local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Baykal said during a program on Interstar TV that "this should
be said clearly and I am doing so, in my role as foreign minister,
the headquarters of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) is in
Damascus."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish foreign minister made the remarks in response to
the escalating tensions in Turco-Syrian ties on the water issue.
</P>
<P>
"How can you reconcile this with good neighborliness? how can
you keep the head of a terrorist organization in your capital?"
Baykal asked.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting in southeastern Turkey for
independence since 1984 and about 20,000 people have been killed
in the clashes between the PKK rebels and Turkish government
troops.
</P>
<P>
Baykal added that the Syrian policy was unacceptable and had to
be changed.
</P>
<P>
PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is believed to be living in
Damascus. Although the Syrians publicly deny this, two German
officials who wanted to talk to Ocalan met him in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Ankara, irked by the meetings, divided its rage between
Germany and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish foreign minister also denied that Turkey had ever
deprived Syria of water and invited both Syria and Iraq to discuss
Turkey's three-stage plan to work out an equitable allocation of
water resources.

<HEADLINE> Jingjiu Railway to Promote Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- With the Jingjiu
(Beijing-Kowloon) railway to open for traffic soon, the Chinese
government is mapping various plans to promote economic
development alongside the line.
</P>
<P>
The railway line will provide plenty of job opportunities for
local people, utilize a lot of local building materials and
daily-use goods, and help develop local industry and agriculture,
said officials with the Ministry of Railways.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing West Railway Station has brought a commercial boom
at the starting point of the railway. A commercial street in front
of the station, 1,100 m long and 54 m wide, involves an investment
of more than 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the commercial center in China's capital
will be shifted to the southwest, and the area around the station
will become the fourth commercial area after Xidan, Wangfujing and
Qianmen.
</P>
<P>
The Jiangxi section of the line in east China has seen the
establishment of ten state-level commodity grain bases, two
high-quality cotton production bases, eight bases for raising
lean-meat pigs and some fishery bases in 12 counties.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, the end of the railway, will speed up the
construction of ports and urban basic facilities to cater to the
increasing number of travellers and quickening commodity
circulation.
</P>
<P>
The line is expected to promote the economic growth of 17
cities and 99 counties, with a coverage of 500,000 sq km,
benefiting nearly 200 million people.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, tourism is expected to grow rapidly,
especially in the Jinggang Mountains, an old Red Army base in
Jiangxi.

<HEADLINE> Expert Team Begins Aerial Survey in Indian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A three-member expert team
today commenced its aerial survey in two helicopters to study the
water level and crop status in Cauvery basin districts in
Karnataka State, the Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
The team was set up by Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao as
part of his efforts to settle the Cauvery water dispute between
Karnataka and Tamil Nadu states. The team had already finished its
survey in Tamil Nadu and will submit its report after completing
its survey in Karnataka state.
</P>
<P>
Official sources in Bangalore, state capital of Karnataka, said
the team would visit parts of Mandya, the heartland of Cauvery
basin, and reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
The neighboring Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have recently been
locked in a dispute over whether Karnataka should release 11
thousand million cubic (TMC) feet of Cauvery water to save
standing crops in Tamil Nadu.
</P>
<P>
Karnataka finally agreed to release 6 TMC feet of water to
Tamil Nadu in deference to a directive announced by the prime
minister on January 2 but still insisted that Tamil Nadu has
enough water itself to meet the need of crops in the state.

<HEADLINE> Report Urges Control Over Local Money Appreciation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- An analytical report by the
State Administration of Foreign Exchange Control (SAFEC) proposes
that the government take measures to ensure that the local
currency, the yuan, does not appreciate by a big margin over the
US dollar for a relatively long time.
</P>
<P>
One way is to effectively contain price rises so that the
exchange rate can remain basically stable to support the
competitiveness of the country's exports, said the report on the
movement of the RMB exchange rate in 1996 carried in the "Shanghai
Securities News" today.
</P>
<P>
Despite the surge in the yuan's value over the dollar in the
past year the local money lost ground over other hard currencies
in general as the yuan's appreciation rate over the US dollar was
lower than over the other currencies, noted the report.
</P>
<P>
But the high inflation last year counteracted to some extent
the effect of the cheaper yuan's export competitiveness, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
However, it predicted that the yuan exchange rate would remain
relatively stable as "a big gap in foreign exchange demand and
supply is unlikely to occur during the first half of this year."
</P>
<P>
The report said factors determining the movement of the yuan's
exchange rate are rather complicated. Those to the advantage of a
stable yuan include a well-placed tight monetary and credit
policy, relatively high interest rates, an expected high inflow
of foreign capital and further expansion of exports.
</P>
<P>
But continued inflation, price rises and a reduction of export
tax rebates could weaken the export growth momentum this year,
noted the report, adding that expansion in fixed assets investment
could lead to an increase in imports.
</P>
<P>
The inflow of foreign capital might slow down with the gradual
recovery of the Western economies, and China has entered a peak
period of foreign debt repayment.
</P>
<P>
All these factors might combine together to pull down the
yuan's exchange rate, cautioned the report.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Ready To Meet Opposition  Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba is ready to meet leaders of opposition parties to discuss
some national issues, a ruling party chief has announced.
</P>
<P>
The National Secretary of the ruling Movement for Multi-party
Democracy (MMD), Michael Sata, said on Sunday he is still waiting
for a proposed agenda from the opposition parties so that
arrangements for the meeting can be made.
</P>
<P>
However, Sata said only those parties which have a presence in
every province will be given a hearing by President Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to discuss everything else except the
constituent assembly, as the government has already made its
position on the matter clear and we shall not shift from that
position," Sata stressed.
</P>
<P>
Last month, some opposition parties called for a meeting with
the president to discuss pressing national issues including the
slow pace of voter registration exercise and ways of adopting the
draft constitution.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties have demanded a constituent assembly
and a national referendum to adopt the draft constitution. But
the government holds that parliament is qualified to approve the
constitution.

<HEADLINE> Government to Aid Three Gorges Area Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The State Education Commission
(SEC) will organize education departments and some colleges and
universities to support educational development in the Three
Gorges Area with funds, materials, equipment and projects.
</P>
<P>
The SEC sources said here today that the educational
departments, and institutions of higher learning will help the
Three Gorges area to improve basic education, teacher training,
vocational and adult education and technological training for
evacuees by providing funds, materials, teaching equipment and
books.
</P>
<P>
The aid work will also involve training educational,
scientific, technological and economic workers, who are badly
needed in the Three Gorges area.
</P>
<P>
The educational departments, colleges and universities will
transmit technology to and exchange information with the
area. They plan to co-operate with local schools to start
businesses on the basis of mutual benefit and sharing advantages.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the introduction of economic, technological and
educational development projects to the area is encouraged. The
SEC has asked local governments at all levels to offer all
possible preferential conditions to encourage more educational
organizations, colleges and universities to take part in local
economic and technological development.
</P>
<P>
The aid plan is in the form of a contract. Some 22 provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions across the country and 45
departments under the State Council are involved in the work,
which will be carried out over a period of five years. Twenty-one
counties and districts in the Three Gorges area will benefit from
the aid work.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project is expected to build a 175-m-high dam
across the Yangtze, the longest river in China. The purpose for
building such a dam is to use the river's abundant water resources
to generate electricity and reduce the possible dangers from
floods.
</P>
<P>
The project is scheduled to be completed in the year 2009 and
cost at least 90 billion yuan (about 10.7 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
About one million people living around the project area will be
evacuated and settled elsewhere.

HARARE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Council for the Blind of
Zimbabwe has urged the government to increase the number of

line with the new integrated education policy, local press

</P>
<P>
"We expect blind children to go to the same schools as the
other children, but only 66 schools have the resources and the
specialist teachers needed to get the students integrated into
the conventional school system. These schools are far from
enough," Sithole was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe government has in the past few years adopted the
integrated education policy to ensure that disabled children will
attend the same schools as able-bodied pupils.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Oppositions Start Nationwide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's mainstream opposition
parties started their 48-hour nationwide strike today to further
demonstrate their demand for the resignation of Prime Minister
Begum Khaleda Zia and the setting up of a neutral caretaker
government to hold the forthcoming general elections.
</P>
<P>
The three mainstream opposition parties -- the Awami (people's)
League, the Jatiya (national) Party and the Jamaat-e-Islami --
earlier announced the strike program for January 3-4, but later
shifted the date to January 8-9 after the Election Commission set
January 8 as the last date for filing nomination papers for the
February 7 national elections.
</P>
<P>
To drum up support for the strike, the opposition parties last
night held rallies and torch processions in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Sheikh Hasina, former opposition leader in the
parliament and president of the Awami League warned that people
would resist at any cost the government's "farce in the name of
election" without the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) government's lust
for power was pushing the country towards constitutional crisis,
Hasina said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, senior ministers had a two-hour meeting with the
prime minister last night to discuss the political situation in
the country.
BNP Secretary General Barrister Abdus Salam Talukder briefed them
on the negotiation with the oppositions and proposals put forward
by the opposition side, but no concrete decision to resolve the
current crisis was taken at the meeting, sources said.

BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS), China's top research institute, has completed a four-year
research program on comprehensive environmental control, making 180
million yuan (about 21.7 million US dollars) in economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
According to today's overseas edition of the "People's Daily",
this is the first time China has conducted such a research program
since its founding in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the program was intended to rationally develop
and use natural resources and improve the deteriorated ecological
system in a comprehensive way.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 researchers from the CAS' 50 institutes have
undertaken 11 pilot projects involving three main fields: how to
improve the fragile ecological system, how to rehabilitate mining
areas and how to develop diverse biological techniques for
protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
Thirty items of technology developed by the researchers have
been applied to environmental control on 44,000 ha of land, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The program, which has passed state assessment, will serve as a
basis for improving China's forest and marine ecological systems,

<HEADLINE> Mechanization Boosts Anhui Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Oxen are gradually being replaced
by a wide variety of farm machinery in Anhui, a leading grain
producing province in east China.
</P>
<P>
The combined power of farm machinery in Anhui has reached 18.05
million kw, a provincial agriculture official said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995 the area cultivated by machinery had
expanded to 2.82 million ha, making up 65 percent of the total
farmland in the province. The ratio was 30 percent higher than
that of 1990. Some 80 percent of rural transport is now done by
motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period, during China's Eighth Five-Year
Plan, the province popularized the use of mechanical sowers and
harvesters and engaged in comprehensive utilization of grain
stalks.
</P>
<P>
Individual farmers were the major buyers of farm
machinery. Local statistics show that farmers bought 5.4 billion
yuan-worth of farm machinery in the same period, 3.1 billion yuan
more than the figure for the 1986-1990 period.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sale of Iodized Salt Inquired in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Nepal has formed a special
committee to inquire into the sale of iodized salt in order to
check the severe condition of iodine deficiency in this Himalayan
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
A sub-committee formed under the Public Accounts Committee of
the House of Representatives met Sunday and decided to ask the
state-owned Salt Trading Corporation to submit a report on its
salt sales within a week.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported that thousands of Nepalese children were
suffering from mentally retarded life due to the government's
inability to supply iodized salt.
</P>
<P>
The iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) could also lead
miscarriage, stillbirth and cretinism which are widespread
especially in the country's remote mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that intake of iodized salt worth two rupees
(less than four US cents) every year for one person could prevent
the IDD disease.
</P>
<P>
The Nepalese government started an anti-IDD program two decades
ago but critics said that the situation had barely improved since
then.
</P>
<P>
Lack of awareness among rural people and the negligence of
government officials were blamed as main reasons for the
prevalence of IDD in the country.
</P>
<P>
During the recently ended house session, legislators asked the
government to provide one kilogram of iodized salt to each family.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
and the World Health Organization (WHO) in Nepal urged the
lawmakers to initiate a bill to prohibit the marketing of
iodineless salt.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from the government-run Salt Trading
Corporation, the company has already stopped importing iodineless
salt but it is being imported illegally due to the habit to use
crystalline salt among rural people.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Tamil Political Parties Forge Consensus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil political
parties are forging a consensus so that they can take a joint
Tamil position before the Parliamentary Select Committee which
will discuss the legal draft of the government's devolution
package, a Tamil political source said today.
</P>
<P>
"We have met a few times and reached a common position. We will
talk with the others so that we can place a joint Tamil position,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, all Tamil Parties approved a four-point program
calling for a merged northeast province, full autonomy, and for a
Muslim unit within the province and Sinhalese in the northeast to
enjoy rights similar to those enjoyed by Tamils and Muslims
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil parties now want to include three more points. These
are a secular state, citizenship for all who live in Sri Lanka for
ten years and the alteration of the phrase "Union of Regions" to
"Union of States" in the draft of the devolution package.
</P>
<P>
The devolution package announced by the government in August
aims to resolve the long-standing ethnic crisis in the country. It
contains proposals for redemarcation of the Northern and Eastern
Provinces and for extending more powers to the Tamils in these
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to submit the legal draft of its
devolution package to Parliament soon.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- One of the worst snowstorms
to hit the nation's east coast in the last 70 years has brought
chaos to the region, at least 14 deaths were blamed on the storm.
</P>
<P>
Blizzards and snowfalls of up to 28 inches in some areas have
shut down airports, caused power failures and closed doors at
retail stores. The storms also kept at home many furloughed
federal workers who were due to report back for duty after a
three-week lay-off.
</P>
<P>
In New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, West
Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina and New York, there were seven
to 28 inches of snow by mid day and it was still snowing.
</P>
<P>
Most airlines canceled or reduced flights into snow-blanketed
cities along the eastern coast, including Washington, New York,
Philadelphia and Newark.
</P>
<P>
Washington's National Airport was closed and the Dulles
International Airport had only one runway open, while New York's
Kennedy and La Guardia airports were both closed. International
flights were rerouted.
</P>
<P>
In North Carolina, sleet and freezing rain cut off power to
residents in many counties in the western part of the coastal
state. In Avery County snow piled up to 28 inches by mid day.
</P>
<P>
In Kentucky, about 18 inches of snow was fallen by mid day. The
Associated Press said a deputy had to hike to her house with a
delivery of special formula milk for her 5-month-old son.
</P>
<P>
In northern Virginia, Washington and Maryland about 2 feet of
snow was on the ground. In Baltimore, there was nearly 25 inches
of snow.
</P>
<P>
The weather service said there hadn't been that much snow in the
area since January 1922.
</P>
<P>
Blizzard warnings were posted for parts of New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Delaware, Washington D.C., and Maryland. In West
Virginia, Ohio, Virginia and Kentucky, heavy snow warnings were
issued.
</P>
<P>
Governors declared state of emergencies in West Virginia,
Maryland and New Jersey. In West Virginia, the National Guard was
placed on alert.
</P>
<P>
Heavy snow also blocked many highways. Tractor-trailer rigs and
buses were ordered off the West Virginia Turnpike through the
rugged southern part of the state. Many trucks voluntarily pulled
off other major highways.
</P>
<P>
Retail stores closed their doors as shoppers stayed home. All
Home Depot stores and many Wal-Mart stores were closed in northern
Virginia. The Rouse Co. closed four of central Maryland's most
popular malls, the first time they had been closed by weather.
</P>
<P>
The snow also kept company employees home from work.

During the past three or four months, several department stores

they had largely ignored previously, the report said.
</P>

Thailand's existing regulations do not provide for the standard

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 8 (Xinhua) -- At least six people were
killed in a rocket attack on the Afghan capital of Kabul when the
Taliban religious student movement and government forces exchanged
fire in the south of Kabul on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Local press here today quoted the official Radio Kabul as
saying that the Taliban was responsible for the killing.
</P>
<P>
There has been no response from the Taliban, who has been
besieging the capital since last October to topple Rabbani's
government.
</P>
<P>
Reports said a number of rockets were fired from the southern
fringes of Kabul which was controlled by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The rockets slammed residential areas and damaged buildings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government claimed that Taliban first opened
fire on government forces early Sunday morning in Rishkhor, nine
kilometers south of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the besieged President Burhanuddin
Rabbani is reportedly trying to negotiate with his rivals.
</P>
<P>
The Kabul government have decided to send an official
delegation to the Taliban headquarters in the southern city of
Kandahar for talks with the Taliban leaders.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani has already sent a delegation to central Bamian on
Saturday for talks with Hezb-i-Wahdat (Khalili Group).
</P>
<P>
Abdur Rasool Sayaf, a close ally of Rabbani, is trying to
arrange a meeting with Hezb-i-Islami chief Gulbuddin Hekmatyar at
the meantime.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban has expressed willingness to accept Rabbani's
representatives while Hekmatyar has not responded to Sayaf's
proposal, said local reports.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANKOK, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Six Thai labor congresses have
threatened to take strong action if the government allows imports
of cheap foreign labor.
</P>
<P>
The threat followed recent moves by state agencies to allow the
hiring of unskilled workers from neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The decision to allow imports of foreign labor was
"unacceptable" and would have an adverse effect on local workers,
according to Prathuang Saengsang, vice president of the Thai Trade
Union Congress.
</P>
<P>
He said on Sunday that cheap foreign labor would deprive local
people of work and cause a surge in crime and social problems.
</P>
<P>
The only people to benefit would be employers, who can pay low
wages, he said.
</P>
<P>
Employers are to be allowed to hire illegal immigrants for
certain labor-intensive jobs in the border provinces on condition
they deposit a cash guarantee with police.
</P>
<P>
A Labor Ministry source said there are about 500,000 illegal
foreign laborers in the country, mostly from Myanmar,
</P>
<P>
Most illegal immigrants work on fishing boats and construction
sites.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Increase Tax on Unleaded Petrol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The excise tax on unleaded
petrol in Thailand may be increased following the ban on the
distribution of leaded petrol which took effect on January 1.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry and the National Energy Policy Office are
considering a tax increase by 75 satang to 3.05 baht (0.122 US
cents) per liter, according to Finance Permanent Secretary
Chatumongkol Sonakul.
</P>
<P>
The new rate on unleaded petrol would be the same as that
previously imposed on leaded fuel.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government no longer needed to provide
incentives for the use of unleaded petrol under a scheme
introduced in 1992 to improve air quality.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is time for the public to take financial
responsibility for preserving the environment.
</P>
<P>
An Excise Department source said the government might increase
the tax gradually rather than in one jump.
</P>
<P>
During the past four years, promotion of unleaded petrol
through a lower tax rate has cost the government about 20 billion
baht (800 million dollars) in revenue.
</P>
<P>
This year the department expects 54 billion baht (2.16 billion
dollars) from petrol taxes.

CANBERRA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The number of job
advertisements declined in Australia in December last year,
pointing to a continued weakness in the country's labor market.
</P>
<P>
The number of employment ads dipped by 1.8 percent after it was
seasonally adjusted in December following a 1.9 percent increase
in the previous month, the ANZ (Australia-New Zealand) Banking
Group Ltd. said in a statement today.
</P>
<P>
In trend terms, the job ads dropped by 0.5 percent in the
month, lower than 0.8 percent in each of the previous three
months.
</P>
<P>
ANZ job advertisement series measures the number of job ads in
major metropolitan daily newspapers and is a barometer of the
country's employment trends.
</P>
<P>
Australia has registered a jobless rate of 8.6 percent in
November and local economists expected that the December figure to
be released on Thursday would be up slightly.
</P>
<P>
The Government is facing a tough task it has pledged of cutting
the jobless rate down to about 5 percent by the end of the
century.

<P>
HONG KONG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Local journalists face a tough
future in the wake of the on-going price war for Chinese-language
newspapers, an industry expert warned.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Tong Kam-piu, chairman of the Hong Kong Journalists'
Association, said the circulation battle has been a rapid
about-turn from the recent boom.
</P>
<P>
"The past two years have seen the media expand very quickly,
and a lot of people were absorbed into the profession with the
emergence of new publications like the Apple Daily, Next Magazine
and Eastweek.
</P>
<P>
"However, what has happened in the past few weeks has been a
swift reversal of fortunes," he was quoted as saying by today's
issue of local newspaper Eastern Express.
</P>
<P>
Since the price war started in mid-December, four newspapers
and two magazines have been closed, which put more than 600 staff
out of work.
</P>
<P>
"Editorial budget will become very tight and we are not
optimistic about annual pay rises for journalists."
</P>
<P>
And Tong predicted a possible plunge of the starting salaries.
"The market is shrinking now while the number of applications is
rising. Although we have not yet seen any examples of staff
salaries being cut, there is a possibility of that happening in
the future," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- German Economics Minister Guenter
Roxrodt today predicted 2 percent growth in the economy in 1996,
but warned unemployment could hit four million over the winter.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Roxrodt said there would be no economic
boom this year, only sustained growth at a low speed.
</P>
<P>
The number of jobless is likely to hit 4 million in winter but
a drop is expected in spring. The unemployment situation will
improve this year in the eastern part of Germany, but it is
difficult to predict for the western part, he said.
</P>
<P>
Roxrodt said the government will present an economic growth and
job creation program at the end of January.

NEW YORK, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Scheduled George Foreman
farewell bout against Michael Moorer, slated here on February 29,
would be cancelled for a second time, according to a local
newspaper on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The fight might not come off due to comments made by Foreman
and promoter Bob Arum about trying to arrange a fight later this
year with Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
The comments undermined the promotion of Foreman-Moorer as the
final fight in the career of the 46-year-old former champion, who
has been stripped of the titles he won by beating Moorer in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Foreman was set to receive 9.6 million U.S. dollars for the
fight while Moorer would have gotten three million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tyson is set to fight British boxer Frank Bruno for the World
Boxing Council title in Las Vegas on March 16, with an eye on

<HEADLINE> Series to Remember Late Premier Zhou Enlai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- China's provincial television
stations will air a 16-part documentary titled "Zhou Enlai, the
Great Man" starting today, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
On the same day 20 years ago, the country's much venerated
premier passed away.
</P>
<P>
The series will also be broadcast through the national tv
station. Videos will soon be released.
</P>
<P>
Zhou's devotion to the State and charisma as a national leader
made him one of the most beloved political figures in the country.
</P>
<P>
The documentary is a solemn memoir, dense with interviews in
which hundreds of people recall their impression of "our premier."
</P>
<P>
"He was so popular with people that we think everybody could
conjure up a personal image of Zhou," Dai Weiyu, producer and
director of the documentary was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although the whole documentary is about Zhou's life, he seldom
showed up on screen.
</P>
<P>
The eight-hour serial covers important events through Zhou's
life: how he came to know late Chairman Mao Zedong and his
marriage with Deng Yingchao.
</P>
<P>
The program relies on friends and close relations for
information. His doctor Wu Jieping discussed his death from liver
cancer in 1970s. Political figures like Henry Kissinger will also
reflect on Zhou's political life and contributions.
</P>
<P>
The doctor said that documentary does not want to mythicize
Zhou. Finished last February, the documentary was warmly received
in Nanjing and Qingdao where it was televised.

<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 20,000 college seniors
visited the Capital Stadium over the weekend to take part in a
talent fair designed to link job seekers and potential employers,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The fair, sponsored by the Ministry of Personnel, aims to help
central government departments and key state-owned enterprises
recruit college graduates, and establish contracts between the job
hunters and local governments, firms and collective, private and
joint-venture businesses.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 employers staffed 370 stalls to promote their
openings, while students wandered through the displays gathering
information and filling out applications.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Daily published Sunday said that the tables of some
western provinces were not left empty, as they had been at earlier
events. They too were crowded with people seeking information. The
report attributes the change to the government's shift of economic
focus to the western part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Coastal provinces and cities like Shanghai, Fujian and
Shandong, however, remained the hot spots for young job-seekers.
</P>
<P>
To the delight of the local police department, more would-be
graduates have show interests in law enforcement. The city police
plans to enlist 1,000 new officers from among the college
graduates this summer.

BONN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Olympic downhill champion Katja
Seizinger of Germany criticized Sunday security measures by the
International Skiing Federation (FIS) in World Cup downhill races.
</P>
<P>
After the death of Austria's Ulrike Maier at
Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, in January 1994, the FIS were
looking to reduce the speed of downhill events.
</P>
<P>
However, Seizinger believes FIS's efforts have had the opposite
effect, as they increased the numbers of gates and turns.
</P>
<P>
According to the German skiing star, the FIS reduced the speed
by five kilometer/hour, but instead of one turn, they put
three. "In the last turn, the piste is so narrow, this place is
now a lot more dangerous than before." She said.

<HEADLINE> More US Women Become Lawyers But Still Earn Less </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- More U.S. women have become
lawyers and judges, making up a larger share in the nation's legal
profession, but they still earn less and get fewer promotions than
men, according to a report released today.
</P>
<P>
The report, released by the American Bar Association's
Commission on Women in the Profession, said women now comprise 23
percent of the nation's lawyers and judges and are expected to
make up 40 percent of the legal profession by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
But "barriers persist. Discrimination continues to permeate the
structures, practices and attitudes of the legal profession," the
ABA's CWP panel said.
</P>
<P>
The panel has found that many women are paid less than men and
win fewer promotions, whether they are in private legal practice,
work as corporate lawyers or teach at law schools. The panel also
said sexual harassment still is a problem for many women in the
legal profession.
</P>
<P>
Male lawyers with 10 years and more experience earned an
average of 90,500 dollars a year compared with 68,500 dollars for
women lawyers. Among corporate lawyers, men were paid more than
women at every level of seniority.
</P>
<P>
Women make up almost 13 percent of the partners in private law
firms, but men with similar experience still are promoted more
often.
</P>
<P>
The panel said the legal profession devalues women by
"excluding them from many avenues of career advancement,"
"restricting their access to key clients," and "questioning their
commitment to the firm if they have or want families."
</P>
<P>
But it also noted that despite the existing problems, women
have made significant headway into the profession that was
dominated by men.
</P>
<P>
In 1971, women were only three percent of the nation's lawyers.
But the figure rose to 13 percent by 1985. Last year, they made up
44 percent of all first-year law students.

<HEADLINE> Property Prospects to Be Dim in UK This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Uncertain economic conditions are
expected to hit demand for commercial property in Britain this
year, according to a report here today.
</P>
<P>
A Confederation of British Industry (CBI) survey, to be
published Monday, said that manufacturing and service companies
are becoming more cautious about investing in property as the
slowdown in output starts to bite.
</P>
<P>
The CBI survey, carried out jointly with estate agent
Grimley and covered 804 companies across all sectors, is expected
to show much weaker growth prospects for companies than last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 28 percent of firms are preparing to reduce their
exposure to property over the next six months and only 23 percent
expect to increase their holdings.
</P>
<P>
This reverses the trend established when the CBI last tested
business confidence six months ago.
</P>
<P>
CBI economist Sudhir Junankar said that "with growth
expectations weaker than in our last survey, companies are now
becoming more cautious before deciding to invest in property."

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs to fully Implement Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb Prime Minister
Rajko Kasagic said today his state was determined to fully
implement the Bosnia peace accord and to secure peace in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a radio in central Bosnian town of Kragujevac,
Kasagic said the military aspect of the peace agreement must be
implemented by January 15 and the Serb side would give full
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"This is in our interest, too, because on January 15 the U.N.
sanctions against the Serb republic should be lifted," he said.
</P>
<P>
The lifting of sanctions is a condition for the implementation
of the civilian aspects of the accord and for establishing
economic ties with the other entities in Bosnia -- the
Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
Kasagic said once the sanctions were lifted it would be
possible for the Serbs to establish cooperation with all states
emerging from the former Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria To Boycott Nations' Cup Hosted By South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A Nigerian minister today
reiterated the government's concern about the security of its
footballers despite South Africa's pledge in the forthcoming
African Nations' Soccer Cup.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the west African nation said it won't send its
players to the soccer contest scheduled to be hosted by South
Africa later this month.
</P>
<P>
Walter Ofonagoro, the Minister of Information and Culture,
said the security situation in South Africa is "still not
satisfactory enough".
</P>
<P>
"It will be sheer irresponsibility to send our players to a
country that had openly called for guerrilla warfare against the
Nigerian government," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said South Africans had forgotten Nigeria's
assistance, both in financial and material resources, in their
struggle to liberate themselves from the clutches of apartheid.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Accuses Syria of Depriving Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today accused Syria of
depriving Turkey's share of the Asi River's (Orontes) water.
</P>
<P>
"It is our intention to raise the question of the Asi River
whenever the water question arises," Foreign Ministry spokesman
Omer Akbel said.
</P>
<P>
"The question of the Asi will inevitably be brought up by the
Turkish side in any water forum," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The Asi River originates from Lebanon, passes through Syria
and flows into the Mediterranean sea within the Turkish province
of Hatay.
</P>
<P>
Syria has built two dams on the river, with two reservoirs
planned. Turkey says the planned reservoirs will further decrease
Turkey's share of its water.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's move is seen as an effort to counter Syria's protest
against it over the construction of another dam on the river.
</P>
<P>
Syria has lobbied some Arab and western countries to accuse
Ankara of polluting the river by building the dam. Seven Arab
countries issued a declaration in Damascus last month, calling
upon Turkey to sign a "just agreement" with Syria on water sharing.
</P>
<P>
The Asi River issue has attracted the attention of Arab and
western diplomats in Ankara.

<HEADLINE> ANC Involvement In Kwazulu/Natal Killings denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki today denied the recent killings in the Kwazulu/Natal
province were caused by party conflicts between the African
National Congress (ANC) and Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).
</P>
<P>
"The mass killing was not originated by conflict between ANC
and IFP," he said at a press conference in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the killing was not carried out by members of
the IFP against the ANC as some media reports described.
</P>
<P>
The police have been carrying on an investigation into the
Christmas Day massacre at Shobashobane near Port Shepstone in
Kwazulu/Natal, which caused 19 deaths and huge property damages.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the investigation would find out who was behind the
violence caused by 600 armed gangsters who swept across the area,
setting fire on stores, houses and government buildings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local media insisted on the partisan aspect of the
ethnic clash. Reports said an estimated 14,000 lives have been
claimed by ANC-IFP conflicts in Kwazulu/Natal during the last few
years.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds of Prison Rioters' Supporters Detained in Istanbul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of people who tried to
attend the funeral for two prisoners killed in last week's riots
were detained by Istanbul police today, local television reported.
</P>
<P>
The Istanbul-based Show tv reported that police took the
supporters to nearby gyms and barred journalists from taking
pictures. But the Show tv crew succeeded in shooting the mass
arrest.
</P>
<P>
Only family members and police were present at the funeral in
the Istanbul suburb of Alibeykoy, where tightened security
measures were taken by Istanbul police.
</P>
<P>
Three prisoners were killed in the riot in the Umraniye prison
riot last week, which triggered protests in several other prisons
in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir.
</P>
<P>
Most of the prisoners involved in the protests are on trial or
serving time for links with the Revolutionary People's Liberation
Party/Front, an extreme leftist group blamed for a series of
attacks in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
Their supporters took to the streets in Istanbul during the
weekend, setting fire to buses, stores and attacked police
forces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, arsonists protesting against the incidents in Turkey
also hit Turkish targets in Germany in the past four days.

<HEADLINE> Re-definition of Nigeria's Foreign Policy Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's permanent
representative in the U.N. Prof. Ibrahim Gambari has proposed
that Nigeria should redefine the objectives of her foreign policy
to make it relevant in the changing world order.
</P>
<P>
Gambari was quoted today by the News Agency of Nigeria as
saying at the University of Abuja that successive governments in
Nigeria are yet to deviate from the principles of her foreign
policy which were formulated before independence from Britain in
1960.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was suspended from its Commonwealth membership, and
some Western countries have imposed sanctions against Nigeria
following the recent hangings of nine Ogoni minority rights
activists for murder in south Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The foreign policy objectives, he said, should include the
promotion of world peace built on freedom, mutual respect and
equality for all peoples of the world.
</P>
<P>
He said in view of her contribution toward decolonization, the
struggle against apartheid, nuclear disarmament, international
peace and security, Nigeria has remained a force to reckon with
within the new world order.
</P>
<P>
On Africa, Gambari said unless African countries urgently
redoubled efforts toward achieving continental unity in economic
and political spheres, prospects of their being further
marginalised in world affairs are very real.
</P>
<P>
He noted that all African nations must urgently address the
problems of hunger, poverty and debt burden, which are
impediments and obstacles against national development.
</P>
<P>
Gambari however cautioned that nobody should dictate to a
nation the mode of democracy it should adopt, saying
democratization process must always suit the particular cultures
and developmental history of any given nation.
