<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) grew by 4.3 percent last year, compared with 1.4
percent in 1994, according to a latest economic report published
the kingdom's Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
"The prices of imports dropped a little last year, which is
clear evidence of the absence of inflationary pressures," the
Saudi Press Agency said today, citing the report.
</P>
<P>
Three quarters of Saudi Arabia's GDP are fulfilled by the
private sector, the report explained.
</P>
<P>
The report added that the Saudi Arabian private sector has
become self-relying as a result of the considerable amount of
measures it has taken, including state's support and encouragement
for the private sector, over the past years.

<HEADLINE> Mass Killer From Tasmania: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Police has confirmed that the
gunman who shot dead at least 33 people in the worst massacre in
Australia's modern history is a mentally disabled man from Hobart,
capital city of Tasmania state.
</P>
<P>
"The man is understood to be intellectually disabled and is
believed to be from Hobart," a statement issued by the Tasmania
Police said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the man stole a car from Port Arthur to
the Seascape Cottages guest house where he was holding three
hostages.
</P>
<P>
Several shots had been shot from the cottage in the past hour,
according to the statement released at 12:30 tonight local time.
</P>
<P>
The police had been attempting to talk him into surrender. The
gunman has made a number of demands when police attempted to talk
him into surrender, including a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Two of the hostages were believed to be a couple running the
guest house and the third man be their guest, police said.
</P>
<P>
Police said that death toll was likely to rise as searching for
bodies was still underway and four of the 18 injured were reported
to be in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that the gunman was in his late teenage or early
20s. He was a blond "surfie-looking fellow."
</P>
<P>
The man drove a Volkswagen car with a surfboard on the roof,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
He had been chatting with tourists "quite lucidly" when he
walked into the packed cafe at the Port Arthur Historic Site early
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"He said 'there are a lot of wasps around today, there aren't
many Japs, are there?' and then began muttering to himself," a
witness said.
</P>
<P>
Wasp is an acronym that refers to "white anglo saxon
protestants." The meaning of the word has been broadened to cover
all white people.
</P>
<P>
He carried a tennis bag. At about 2:30 pm local time, he
suddenly pulled out an automatic rifle out of the bag and began to
shoot at people indiscriminately.
</P>
<P>
"He left the site shooting as he went, shooting everybody he
could see," said Wendy Scurr, who was working at the front desk of
the historic site.
</P>
<P>
She said that the gunman continued to shoot at people after he
went outside the cafe. He picked up his victims one by one as
people screamed and ran away from him.
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't going bang bang bang -- it was bang and then he'd
pick someone else out and line them up and shoot them," witness
Phillip Milburn told ABC radio.
</P>
<P>
"It was a gun that was meant to kill people," he said.
</P>
<P>
The gunman also shot at a number of cars and shot more people
dead at the nearby Fox and Hounds Hotel when he drove away from
the site of the first shooting.
</P>
<P>
He drove five km and took hostages before he was rounded up in
the cottage. Then he continued to shoot at helicopters that took
his victims to hospital, witnesses said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A round table meeting organized
by the European Commission (EU) attended by representatives of
employers and trade unions and EU officials opened here today to
work out ways of tackling the unemployment problems in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was intended to promote a "pact of confidence for
employment", which is aimed at securing specific commitments from
the various agents concerned to promote job creation.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, more than 70 participants will
debate the following four key themes defined by the EC:
flexibility and organisation of the labor market, labor costs and
social security, education and training and job-creating systems.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment has been endemic in Europe since the seventies,
and the rate of structural unemployment is increasing regularly,
said EC President Jacques Santer in his opening address at today's
meeting.
</P>
<P>
He noted that, between 1991 and 1994, total employment fell by
four percent in EU.
</P>
<P>
Santer stated that the restoration of a climate of confidence
is a prior condition for a recovery in investment and consumption.
</P>
<P>
"Ways must also be found of amplifying the measures taken in
several Member States to contend with worsening unemployment," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to latest figures from EUROSTAT, the statistical
office of the European Communities, the rate of unemployment of EU
is 11 percent, with about 18.3 million people in the jobless
force.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bus Blast Shocks Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 28 (Xinhua) -- When the whole nation was
preparing to celebrate Eid-ul-Azha, a Muslim holiday due on
Monday, a bus blast shocked Pakistan by killing 52 people in
Punjab province today.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports, a bomb was attached to the petrol
tank of a passenger bus heading from Lahore, metropolis of Punjab,
to Pattoki, 100 kilometers southwest of the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
The bomb went off with deafening explosion when the bus reached
a crowded bus-stop near Phool Nager, about 52 kilometers off
Lahore, where many people were waiting to go home for Eid.
</P>
<P>
The blast caused a huge fire which engulfed the entire bus,
reducing trapped passengers to skeleton.
</P>
<P>
"No skin remained on their body and it were only bones and
skulls which left the bodies unrecognized," local reports quoted
eyewitness as saying.
</P>
<P>
Had fire been extinguished in time large number of casualties
could have been avoided, said some reports.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Associated Press of Pakistan, 52
people were killed and 28 others injured, some of them seriously,
in the accident.
</P>
<P>
However, other sources said the toll was up to 100.
</P>
<P>
A bomb disposal team of experts rushed to the site for probe.
</P>
<P>
Senior district administration officials reached the spot to
supervise the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, Acting President and Senate
Chairman Wasim Sajjad and Punjab provincial Chief Minister Sardar
Muhammad Nakai issued strong statements, condemning the "terrorist
activity."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the government will not compromise to
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
She said her government will fight until the last terrorist is
brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
Acting President Sajjad while condemning the "dastardly act"
called upon provincial administration to bring the criminals into
justice.
</P>
<P>
The chief minister termed the accident a "terrorist activity."
</P>
<P>
He said the government could not be cowed down through cheap
tactics.
</P>
<P>
Punjab, the most populous province in Pakistan, once enjoyed
relative peace compared with its neighboring Sindh province, while
confrontation between the government and the ethnic Mohajir Qaumi
Movement caused 1,800 deaths last year in Karachi alone.
</P>
<P>
However, since the beginning of this year, a series of violence
occurred in Punjab.
</P>
<P>
Two bombs exploded in Lahore on January 18, leaving 32 people
injured.
</P>
<P>
Six vehicles were damaged by a hand-made explosive on April 9
in Lahore.
</P>
<P>
Again on April 14, six people were killed when a bomb went off
in an outpatient department waiting-room of a cancer hospital set
up by former cricket star Imran Khan.
</P>
<P>
But so far, today's accident was the most serious bomb blast
that happened in Lahore this year.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader Nawaz Sharif said once while commenting on
the law and order situation in Punjab that it may be the outlaw
criminals have moved their activities from Sindh, which has
witnessed a decline in violence early this year, to Punjab.
</P>
<P>
The federal government has directed the Punjab provincial
government to take stern action against the increase in "terrorist
activities" in the province.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China today congratulated
the Group of 77 on adopting its ministerial declaration at UNCTAD
ix this morning.
</P>
<P>
This was declared by Long Yongtu, Assistant Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation at the Eighth Ministerial
Meeting of the Group of 77, which China was invited to attend as
a special guest.
</P>
<P>
Mr Long said China has all along attached importance to her
cooperation with the Group of 77, backed its just proposals and
reasonable demands and has maintained very good ties with it.
</P>
<P>
During negotiations on China's entry into the WTO, China has
persisted in retaining her position as a developing country,
because it thinks the terms of its entry should be in keeping
with its development level, said the Chinese minister.
</P>
<P>
He said this is also because China has common interests and a
common position with the vast majority of the developing
countries in the multi system of the world economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
China rejects the terms put forth by some western powers
demanding China enter the World Trade Organization as a developed
country.
</P>
<P>
Long praised the Group of 77 for making major contribution in
three decades to adopting such convention or agreement as the
generalized system of preferences and the "charter of economic
rights and obligation of varaious countries" favorable to the
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
"We consider that the reason why UNCTAD is powerful is the
positive and leading role played by the Group of 77," said Long.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We hope the developing countries should be united
and reinforce cooperation, bring into full play the role of the
Group of 77 in promoting south-south cooperation and south-north
dialogue and strengthening its functions of trade and
development, and contribute more to safeguarding the interests of
the developing countries."
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to strive, together with the Group of 77, to
establish a just and reasonable international economic new order
so as to promote the common development of the developing
countries," said Long.
</P>
<P>
Two round tables, one of heads of state and the other of heads
of agencies, were held last night to discuss the theme: "the
excluded 2 billion: integrating people in the global economy".
</P>
<P>
From April 30 to May 5, there will be general debate at
ministerial round table sessions which will be followed by
drafting documents on May 6-8 and consulting among contact group
later.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth Session of UN Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD ix) which has been attended by 188 member states, will be
closed on May 11. enditem

<HEADLINE> Buthelezi Criticizes Proposed New Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi today lashed out
at the proposed contents of the new constitution, claiming the
country was now facing a recipe for a "totalitarian autocracy".
</P>
<P>
Speaking to IFP supporters at a local government election
rally near Empangeni in Kwazulu/Natal Province, Buthelezi said:
"There is no doubt in my mind that the greatest danger to liberty
in this country is the African National Congress (ANC)'s new
national constitution."
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said the new constitution, scheduled to be adopted
on May 8, was designed to give central government power to
override the functions of provincial government.
</P>
<P>
The document eliminated any degree of real provincial autonomy
and failed to guarantee traditional communities their right to
exercise autonomous power, said the IFP leader.
</P>
<P>
The IFP withdrew from the constitutional assembly early last
year, protesting against ANC's failure to honour an agreement on
international mediation reached before the 1994 general election.
</P>
<P>
The IFP once claimed that it would not abide by the
constitution because it did not participate in the
constitution-writing process.
</P>
<P>
However, Buthelezi said in his Sunday speech that the IFP was
still prepared to re-join the constitution-making process before
the May 9 deadline, set by the interim constitution.
</P>
<P>
"Even at this late stage we are prepared to re-enter the
constitutional process if the ANC will abide by the promise it made
to us regarding international mediation," declared Buthelezi.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- India's Election Commission
today ordered repolling in 79 polling stations and one assembly
(state parliament) constituency for the first phase of the
country's month-long general elections, the Press Trust of India
said.
</P>
<P>
The repolling in the 79 polling stations in Andhra Pradesh,
Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka would take place on April 30.
</P>
<P>
Andhra Pradesh topped the list with the three-member commission
directing that repolling should take place in 53 polling stations
including 17 in Nandyal from where Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha
Rao is seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
The decision to order repolling was taken by the commission
following reports of violence, poll malpractices including
snatching of ballot papers and boxes, adjournment of polling and
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
in Assam, fresh polling would be held on April 30 for the
segment of assembly seats in Nagaon constituency because of wrong
printing of ballot paper and deleting the name of an independent
candidate.
</P>
<P>
India on Saturday held the first phase of polling of the
general elections in 14 states and union territories for 150
parliamentary and 532 state assembly seats.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian parliament today
passed a law which bans smoking in public places, Iran's official
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The public places where smoking is banned include holy shrines,
mosques, administrative offices, factories, banks, hospitals,
movie theaters, hotels, public transport means, bus terminals,
restaurants, schools and universities, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The law also prohibits sale or purchase of cigarettes and
tobacco on the streets and in public places.

Under the law, anyone who violates the ban faces a fine of
between 20,000 rials (6.6 U.S. dollars) to 100,000 rials (33.3
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The law will go into effect after the rules for its
implementation are drawn up and approved by the Cabinet, IRNA
said.

Procedure for the implementation of the law is to be compiled

<HEADLINE> Muslims Allowed to Visit Cemeteries in Doboj </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The authorities in Doboj, a Serb
town in north Bosnia, allowed today a group of Muslims to visit
the graves of their kin.
</P>
<P>
Doboj Mayor Drago Ljubicic told the local radio that the local
administration had agreed with the NATO-led peace Implementation
Force (IFOR) that two buses carrying Muslims from Tesanj can cross
over from the Muslim-Croat federation to Serb territory today.
</P>
<P>
The Muslims will visit the graves of their kin on the occasion
of the Muslim religious holiday Bayram, after which they will
return to Tesanj. Seven unauthorized visits to Serb land were
expected today by the Muslim refugees in central and northwestern
Bosnia, the Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The two buses will be escorted by the IFOR and the
International Police up to the Serb border in Doboj, and from
there Serb police will join the escort.
</P>
<P>
Ljubicic also asked Doboj inhabitants to be cautious following
last week's incident when Muslims tried to enter the town by
force.
</P>
<P>
Muslims who wish to see their old homes and Serbs who blocked
their entry clashed early last week with stones and sticks,
prompting the IFOR to intervene in the incident and even fire
shots into the air to disperse the melee. Serb officials claimed
that 12 Serb citizens of Doboj were injured in the incident.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR command warned Muslims on the eve of Bayram that it
would prevent any unauthorized or not previously arranged entry
into Serb territories, threatening to use force if necessary,
Tanjug added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Serbian police have launched an
intensive investigation into a terrorist attack on the Prizren
regional center police commander in Dusanovo in Serbia's southern
province of Kosovo and Metohija (Kosmet).
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said terrorists planted a large
quantity of explosives beside the house of police commander Milos
Scekic Saturday. Part of the external wall was destroyed, all
glass surfaces were shattered and ceilings were cracked in the
explosion but nobody was injured.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been high in Kosmet since last week after unknown
perpetrators on April 22 carried out five attacks in different
parts of the province, killing five Serbs, including one
policeman, and injuring a number of others.
</P>
<P>
The reprisal incidents were sparked by the killing of an ethnic
Albanian on April 20 in Pristina, the provincial capital. Kosmet
has a population of around 900,000 with 90 percent being ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The killer, a Serb who said he fired shots because he believed
the victim was stealing his car, was caught at once and an
investigative procedure was under way against him.
</P>
<P>
A strong ethnic Albanian separatist movement has been active in
the province for decades. They demand a separate republic and
annexation with neighboring Albania.

<P>
LAGOS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- About 1,000 elephants have
invaded Hong local government area of Damawa State, eastern
Nigeria, destroying crops and threatening the lives of the
people.
</P>
<P>
The people in the affected villages have to set up bush
fires in strategic places during the invasion at night, in
a bid to scare away the animals, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported today.
</P>
<P>
In some of the affected villages, more than 700 farmers
claimed that their crops and economic trees, including banana,
cassava and sugarcane, had been destroyed by the animals. Total
losses so far are estimated at millions of Naira, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The local government Chairman Dunama Azura has appealed to
the state government for financial assistance to the farmers
affected.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Wild Life Unit of the State Ministry of
Agriculture is urged to study the movement pattern of the
elephants and identify ways of driving them away.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, elephants invaded Hong and Ong local
government areas of the state a year ago. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Reversing the disturbing trend
of rising drug use among children will be the top objective of a
new drug strategy U.S. President Bill Clinton will announce
Monday, the government's top drug official said today.
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the day, there can be only one clear priority
and that is focus on youth, drug prevention and education," Barry
McCaffrey, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy,
said on NBC's "Meet the Press."
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey, who took office seven weeks ago, said that the new
drug program could take a decade to show results.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that while use of cocaine and other hard
drugs is down among the general population, use of marijuana among
young people has doubled and interdiction of drugs flowing into
the country from abroad has fallen.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey said that the program will include drug courts, which
provides first-time abusers with treatment rather than sending
them to jail.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey said drug legalization is "out of the question" and
that medicinal use of marijuana is a "non-scientific approach to
the problem."

JERUSALEM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel today eased its closure
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and 10,000 Palestinians would be
allowed to enter Israel to work, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Border crossings between Israel and the Palestinian territories

</P>
<P>
Palestinian trucks would be escorted on their way to

Israel is also preparing to pull its troops out of most of
Hebron, the last West Bank town still under Israeli occupation,
Israeli Health Minister Ephraim Sneh said today.
</P>
<P>
He said the withdrawal may take place before Israel's general
elections scheduled for May 29, Israeli radios reported.
</P>
<P>
The pullout was initially scheduled for late March but was
delayed after the four suicide bombings by Islamic militants
killed 59 innocent people between February 25 and March 4.

NAIROBI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary-general of the
United Nations Boutros Boutros-Ghali said here today that he
looks forward to discussing with Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
on African problems.
</P>
<P>
He said President Moi has been a consistent source of strength
and support for the United Nations. " I look forward to
discussing with him critical issues relating, in particular, to
Africa, whose persistent problems are in many ways a challenge to
the family of nations," the UN chief said.
</P>
<P>
Boutros Boutros-Ghali made the remarks when he arrived at Jomo
Kenyatta International Airport this afternoon. He is here to
preside over a two-day meeting of heads of U.N. agencies which
starts on Monday. Nairobi is one of the world's biggest UN
centres.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Manufacturing Sector Unsatisfctory In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The manufacturing sector of
Nigeria performed unsatisfactorily in 1995, with lowered
industrial capacity utilization and increased balance of payments
deficit.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report which reached here today, the
Manufacturers' Association of Nigeria (MAN) said that industrial
capacity utilization last year stood at 27.86 percent, a decline
of 1.9 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
A survey carried out by MAN also shows that about 54 percent
of the raw materials for the manufacturing sector were supplied
locally last year.
</P>
<P>
The unsatisfactory performance, which caused a drop of 4.6
percent in the sector's employment rate, was the result of such
unfavaorable factors as lack of policy coordination, tardiness in
the implementation of measures designed to stimulate economic
activities and uncertainties surrounding the clearing of goods at
the ports in the first half of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that although relative stability in the
exchange rate was achieved during the year, the cost remained
high for companies, adding that new and higher levels of multiple
levies and taxes imposed by state governments aggravated the
problem.
</P>
<P>
"Persistent inflation and static income growth for the
wage/salary earners sustained persistent flagging consumer
demand, which impacted on production and capacity uilization,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The country's overall balance of payments deficit for the
year under review was 2,028.7 million U.S. Dollars, compared
with 1,947.5 million Dollars for the previous year,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Proceeds from both oil and non-oil revenue during the year
ammounted to about 16.091 billion Dollars as against the
projected target of 15.955 billion Dollars," it said, indicating
that the overall balance of payments deficit reflected massive
net capital outflow.
</P>
<P>
MAN had 2,254 companies as its members at the end of last
year.

<HEADLINE> UK Government in Secret Contact with Sinn Fein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The British government confirmed
today that it has opened up a secret channel of communications
with the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and its political wing Sinn
Fein, according to a BBC TV report.
</P>
<P>
Ulster minister Michael Ancram was quoted as saying that senior
Conservative member of parliament and former Northern Ireland
minister Michael Mates as a go-between had held secret talks with
Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
But Ancram stressed that the private talks had been at the
request of Sinn Fein, and so far little progress had been made.
</P>
<P>
Press reports today revealed that it was Prime Minister John
Major who had authorized secret links with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
And the talks, seen as a last-ditch effort to make the IRA to
restore its cease-fire, began several weeks ago. The talks are
designed to help Sinn Fein and the IRA understand the government's
position on the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
British intelligence assessments have suggested that it is
unlikely for the IRA to announce a new cease-fire before the start
of all-party talks scheduled for June 10.
</P>
<P>
However, the talks will continue despite of the IRA's wave of
bombings in London, including last week's attempt to blow up the
Hammersmith bridge in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein in a statement issued in Belfast confirmed that two
meetings had taken place between its senior officials and Mates
since September 1995.
</P>
<P>
But it said that the significance of the dialogue should not be
exaggerated and nothing of substance emerged out of either
discussion.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has indicated it would contest the elections in
Ulster on May 30 and the forum to be produced in the elections.
</P>
<P>
The British government still insists that Sinn Fein could not
be admitted to the planned all-party negotiations on the future of
Ulster unless the IRA revived its truce.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry today pledged to step up U.S. efforts to improve Israel's
defense against missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
Perry made the commitment during a meeting with visiting
Israeli Prime Minister and Defense Minister Shimon Peres at the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
"It should reduce any incentive for any country to launch a
missile because they would see it would be ineffective," Perry
told a joint press conference with Peres.
</P>
<P>
Perry and Peres signed a "statement of intent" that reaffirms
the United States' support for Israel's efforts to develop ways to
shoot down ballistic missiles such as the Scud missiles that Iraq
fired on Israel during the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The United States agreed to provide Israel with real-time data
from its spy satellites to help warn the Jewish state of any
impending missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel has reportedly long wanted to have access to
sophisticated U.S. spy satellites which provide instantaneous
data on missile attack. Having such information can aid Israel in
thwarting a missile attack by giving it time to activate its
so-called theater missile defense systems.
</P>
<P>
As part of the accord, the United States and Israel will also
agree to accelerate a pair of on-going joint programs to develop
anti-ballistic missile defense systems.
</P>
<P>
The two systems under the development are the Arrow missile
defense system and the Nautilus system.
</P>
<P>
Perry said that the United States will provide a prototype of
the Nautilus system, a laser weapon designed to be used against
short-range missiles, to Israel by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Peres, who arrived here earlier today, is going to meet with
U.S. President Bill Clinton later this evening for talks on
strengthening security cooperation between the two nations.

<HEADLINE> UK Disappointed by Germany's Position on Beef Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain is disappointed of a
German statement today that it will reject British demands for a
lifting of the European Union's ban on Britain's worldwide beef
exports, BBC tv reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg is expected to demand
an end to the EU ban Tuesday at a meeting with his partners of
the 15-state club and the British government intends to seek
support from Germany.
</P>
<P>
But on the eve of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's visit to
Britain, Germany's ruling Christian Democratic Union in a
statement said that it was too early for the EU ban to be lifted
because Britain had yet to propose "any real action" to tackle the
mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Tory Eurosceptics were infuriated by Kohl,
who was reported to insist that Britain will be forced by the
finance district of London into accepting a single European
currency.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in the Sunday Times newspaper, Kohl had a
private meeting with the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of
Britain's parliament in Bonn 10 days ago and the German chancellor
said that British top businessmen would not want to miss out a
single European currency.
</P>
<P>
Some Tory Eurosceptics believed that what Kohl said once again
proved that Germany wanted to dominate the European financial
system.
</P>
<P>
They accused Kohl of "arrogant presumption."
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted last month by the Sunday Times showed that
56 percent of Britain's top businessmen were strongly against a
single European currency as compared with 37 percent six years
ago.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni President Meets with French Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA. April 29 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
met here today with Francis Guthman, personal envoy of French
President Jacques Chirac, who briefed President Saleh about his
talks in Asmara in pursuit of France's good offices to resolve the
Yemeni-Eritrean conflict over the Red Sea island of Greater Hanish.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, President Saleh expressed appreciation of
France's efforts to reach a peaceful settlement, emphasizing that
Yemen was in favor of a peaceful resolution of the conflict. He
hoped the French envoy would succeed in his mission.
</P>
<P>
President Saleh asserted that his country would cooperate with
France in strengthening security and stability in the Red Sea
area, and in safeguarding the safety of international navigation.
He pointed out that the peaceful solution was the right option
that would avert regional tension and guarantee the interests of
all parties.
</P>
<P>
The French envoy is visiting Sanaa for the second time to keep
the Yemenis posted about France's mediation talks with Eritrean
President Isaias Afewerki on the Yemeni-Eritrean conflict. The
French envoy had earlier left Sanaa on April 27 on his way to
Asmara in the course of his shuttle between Yemen and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Yemen and Eritrea fought a brief battle on the disputed island
of Greater Hanish in December 1995. Eritrean forces took control
of the island before a ceasefire took effect on December 18.
</P>
<P>
Two nearby islands, Zuqar and Lesser Hanish, are now controlled
by Yemen but also claimed by Eritrea.

<P>
BRUSSELS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) has
approved a food and medical aid project worth 700,000 ECUs (about
910,000 U.S. dollars) for the victims of the civil war in the tiny
west African state of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The aid program is on top of the humanitarian assistance given
by non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The EC said about one million Sierra Leonean people have fled
their homes since war broke out in 1991. About 250,000 of them
have gathered around the central and eastern cities of Bo and
Kenema, where they are in dire need of emergency aid.
</P>
<P>
The five-year war has claimed about 30,000 lives and nearly
ruined the economy.

<HEADLINE> ADB Stresses Energy Development in Greater Mekong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
said today that more investment priority should be given to the
development of energy sector in the greater Mekong subregion.
</P>
<P>
According to Vladimir Bohun, manager of Energy Division of the
Asian Development Bank, the greater Mekong subregion enjoys
abundant energy resources but utilization is very low,
</P>
<P>
During a seminar held today in the Asian Development Bank,
Bohun said that the greater Mekong subregion is well endowed with
energy resources with over 1,000 twh (trillion watt/ hour)
hydropower potential or more than ten times the current total
power generation.
</P>
<P>
If fully developed, this potential could provide about 250,000
mw (million watt) in installed capacity.
</P>
<P>
He said only 2 percent of the hydropower potential has been
harnessed to date, and the annual per capita electricity
consumption in the subregion averages only 300 kwh, which is just
a fraction of the consumption levels in the industrialized
countries.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the electricity consumption is estimated to
increase more than six times in the period of 1993-2020, from 90
twh to about 600 twh, with Thailand accounting for two thirds of
the total.
</P>
<P>
He said that to meet the growing demand, major private sector
involvement in energy development will be required.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a shift to a more integrated approach, particularly
through power grid interconnection, would bring a number of
important benefits.
</P>
<P>
The greater Mekong subregion covers an area of three million
square kilometers which includes Cambodia, Yunnan province of
China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft's Windows to Adopt Java Programming Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- American software giant Microsoft
is planning to integrate Java, the Internet programming language
of U.S. computer company Sun Microsystems, into a future version
of Windows, reports here said.
</P>
<P>
The move could send the Internet browser market dominated by
Netscape of California into sharp decline by allowing users to
access the Net and run Java applications without the need for a
World Wide Web browser, which is believed to be the only software
that can adequately display Web pages on a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Sun has only licensed Java for use in browsers.
</P>
<P>
But JavaSoft, a division of Sun that markets Java programming
language, is to announce a relaxation of the licensing rules this
week, allowing Microsoft to put Java into Windows, newspapers in
London reported.
</P>
<P>
By having access to the Java code, applications such as word
processor, spread-sheet or graphics package, can easily take
advantage of the Net and share data and even the program code with
other users.
</P>
<P>
The announcement will, Sun hopes, move Java away from being a
Net-only system, allowing developers to write desk-top
applications in Java.

<HEADLINE> Major Admits He Would Lose Referendum on Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
conceded today that he would lose a referendum on whether Britain
should join a single European currency.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with his German counterpart Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, Major said that his government would not win such a
referendum because the whole country would vote against his
recommendation to joint an EU currency.
</P>
<P>
But he said that there was no prospect of such a thing today,
"so the question does not rise."
</P>
<P>
The cabinet would choose if and when a referendum would be
held, he added.
</P>
<P>
However the prime minister, who has been haunted for more than
four years by the issue of Europe, seems now to face fresh
infighting over this matter within his Conservative party.
</P>
<P>
An internal survey of the "92 Group" of Tory MPs showed that
right-wingers are preparing to rebel against the party's official
line during the coming general election campaign. They would
oppose a single European currency and back a referendum on
Britain's relations with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed in press today showed that up to 60
right-wingers in the 100-strong "92 Group" intended to make plain
in personal election addresses that they depart from the official
Tory EU policy.
</P>
<P>
It is revealed that the government's position in the Tory
election manifesto is to leave open the option of a single
European currency in the next parliament and to pledge that a
referendum would be held to endorse or oppose any cabinet decision
to go in, but to reject any referendum on Britain's wide relations
with Europe.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted against the background that Sir James
Goldsmith, leader of the Referendum party, has threatened to field
up to 600 pro-referendum candidates to contest the seats with
Tories in the next general election scheduled for May 1997, and
pro-European Tories are likely to be particular targets.

<HEADLINE> ADB Seminar Cites China's Financial Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Finance Secretary
Robeto de Ocampo today said that one important experience in
China's financial reform is that reform benefits have to reach to
people.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a seminar held at the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) on financial sector in transition.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo, who was also chairman of the seminar, said it is an
economic base on which further economic reform can be pushed
forward.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's experience can be followed by other Asian
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, Li Ruogu, ADB executive director for China,
said that economic development together with the financial reform
has made people rich.
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to 1995, he said that China's per capital financial
assets increased from 40 RMB (4.8 US dollars) to 3000 RMB (361 US
dollars). He added that total household deposits jumped from less
than 40 billion RMB (4.8 billion US dollars) in 1978 to 3,000
billion RMB (361 billion US dollars) in 1995, a 62.5 time
increase.
</P>
<P>
This does not include several hundred million RMB securities
issued in the last ten years or so, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the annual investment rate for the last 17 years has
been keeping up at 30-40 percent and accumulated fixed assets
investment in the last five years was more than 6.1 trillion RMB
(735 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
This large amount of financial assets has been the main
resources for maintaining an annual average of nine percent
growth rate for about two decades, he added.

WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Former CIA director William
Colby was reported missing on Sunday after his capsized canoe was
found adrift in a river south of Washington.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said that Coast Guard crews had searched
the waters around his Rock Point home at Cobb Island on the

<HEADLINE> EU, Japan Agree to Promote Dialogue on Deregulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Both the European Union (EU) and
Japan are willing to promote dialogue on deregulation, EU's Trade
Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said today.
</P>
<P>
But, although relations between the two sides are "in good
shape", said Sir Leon, "We still have a long way to go before
Japan is as open to foreign imports and investment as Europe is.
</P>
<P>
"The EU will continue to press with force and persistence for a
deregulated and open Japanese economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sir Leon, vice-president of the European Commission (EC), was
speaking after a three-hour meeting between the EU officials and
Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda and other Japanese
ministers to discuss trade and economics.
</P>
<P>
He said relations between the 15-nation EU and Japan are "in
good shape" but need to be improved further.
</P>
<P>
"We are focusing on a broad-based approach, building a mature
political relationship alongside our close economic ties," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although trade between the EU and Japan has grown rapidly, with
more and more European products exported to Japan, the EU has been
pressing Japan to make its market more open to European exports
and to remove the trade barriers between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
At a 1994 ministerial meeting in Tokyo between the two sides,
Brittan urged Japan to take steps to cut its trade surplus to the
EU, which suffered a trade deficit of 26.3 billion U.S. dollars
with Japan in 1993.
</P>
<P>
After today's meeting, Sir Leon said that since then, both
sides agreed that relations between the EU and Japan have
continued to improve and that EU-Japan trade has been increasing
at a faster rate than world trade.
</P>
<P>
But he pointed out that there was still a long way to go before
Japan's market was as open as the EU's.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, the two sides also discussed Euro-Asian
relations, the world economy and international trade.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese delegation held a special meeting with EC
President Jacques Santer here today.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to see a net
increase of 10 million BP users this year, which will make the
country surpass the US and become the world's biggest BP user.
</P>
<P>
The total number of BP users in the country will top 40
million, up 43 percent from last year's 28 million, according to a
press conference held by Motorola here today.
</P>
<P>
The company, one of the world's telecommunications giants, has

</P>
<P>
The paging industry has seen a rising trend over the past few
year, and BP pagers are widely used in the country, even in the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
But as many overseas telecommunications companies have elbowed
their way into the sector, and pager prices have been slashed by a
big margin, from 2,000 yuan each to 500 yuan or 600 yuan.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are about 100 types of pagers on the Chinese
market, and they are becoming smaller and smaller.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Communications Network Opened For CAAC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China has for the first time set
up a special satellite communications network for its booming
aviation industry, the Civil Aviation Administration of China
(CAAC) announced today.
</P>
<P>
The network, which covers all 97 airports across the country
and provides over 2,600 data and communication terminals, cost a
total of over 210 million yuan (about 25 million US dollars), CAAC
officials said, adding that all the equipment used at the earth
stations are products of the US Hughes Company.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xuhua, director of the Air Traffic Control Bureau under
CAAC, said that the network will greatly improve the communication
conditions for air traffic management, and further guarantee the
safety of flights.
</P>
<P>
"The telephone earth stations of this network are already in
use, construction of the digital exchange system is expected to be
completed by the end of this year," he added.
</P>
<P>
Via the AsiaSat-1 satellite orbiting at 138 degrees east
longitude -- right over the Equator -- the CAAC network can be
used for direct air traffic control phone calls, sharing of radar
and meteorological data, and telephone conferences.
</P>
<P>
During a demonstration of the network here today, CAAC
officials successfully contacted by phone domestic earth stations
at Guangzhou, Shanghai, Haikou, Harbin, Urumqi, and Lhasa
airports, as well as three foreign air traffic control centers in
Ulan Bator, Katmandu, and Rangoon, respectively, which are also
included in the CAAC network.
</P>
<P>
This year China's aviation industry has enjoyed a large input
of funds and technology from the government in its infrastructure,
including airport construction and upgrading of air routes, in a
bid to catch up with the rapid growth of the country's air
transportation demand.
</P>
<P>
"CAAC is planning to build a second special satellite
communications network over the next five years," Chen revealed.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Asia to Encourage Private Sector in Urban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A massive rural-urban
transformation is taking place throughout the Asia and Pacific
region, which will become predominantly urban in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The role of cities in national development will be substantial,
and the infrastructure required to support the region's rapid
urbanization will be enormous.
</P>
<P>
However, experts said that productive and sustainable cities
will be based upon efficient linkages between the public and
private sectors and effective policy frameworks clearly
identifying the roles of various sectors.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar held today on urban management and finance in the
Asia and Pacific region, Eustace Nonis, director of the ADB
Agriculture and Social Sectors Department, said that the region
needs some 280 billion US dollars for investment in urban
infrastructure each year for the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Despite the economic variance between countries, different
government structures and alternative financial systems, he said
that a broad consensus has been reached on the major directions to
be followed.
</P>
<P>
That is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of service
providers and the productivity, livability and sustainability of
the region's cities, he added.
</P>
<P>
It also requires changes in financing systems, he said, to
enable local governments and other services to access national and
international capital markets, and to enable the private sector to
participate in the provision of services.

<HEADLINE> HK Leather Fair Continues in Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The second phase of the world's
 leading leather industry event, the Asia Pacific leather
Fair '96, got underway today at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center (HKECC) with the fashion and Finished Products
-- Spring Show.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,300 international exhibitors are showcasing the latest
fashion trends and design innovations from the colorful world of
leather. The Fair is scheduled to end on May 1.
</P>
<P>
Introduced as a separate fair two years ago to accommodate
exceptional demand, the Fashion and Finished Products show has
experienced the most dramatic growth. Exhibitor numbers increased
200 percent in 1994 when the show was first launched, then by 50
percent in 1995 and then by a further 10 percent this year, with
the only restriction on further growth being the limited space at
the HKCEC.
</P>
<P>
Miller Freeman Asia, the Fair manager, said that the growth in
demand for fashionable leather goods reflects increasing consumer
sophistication throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's imports of leather consumer goods increased 10
percent last year to 34.3 billion HK dollars (4.4 billion US
dollars). Leather handbags, suitcases and clothing are among the
most popular imported items. Hong Kong's main suppliers are
China, Italy, France, Taiwan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's total exports of leather consumer goods amounted to
 38.6 billion HK dollars (4.96 billion US dollars) last year -- an
 increase of 9 percent over 1994. Key markets are the United
States, Japan, Germany, Canada, Britain and Australia.

<HEADLINE> HSI Services Ltd. Launches Asia Index to Gauge Regional Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hang Seng Index (HSI)
Services Limited today announced the launch of its first regional
index, the Hang Seng Asia Index, to gauge the overall performance
of the Asian equity markets.
</P>
<P>
The index is based on eight Asian stock indexes covering a
total of 2,000 companies valued at more than 1,000 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Together, the eight indexes account for more than 80 percent of
 the total market capitalization of the stock markets they
represent -- making the Hang Seng Asia Index one of the most
representative Asian stock market indexes in terms of market
capitalization coverage.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference today, Anthony Wong, Chairman of
 the HSI Services Limited, said, "The Asian equity markets as a
whole, excluding Japan, expanded by almost 15 times in the decade
up to 1994, compared to the threefold increase for the rest of the
 world. As a result, the Asian markets now account for around 10
percent of the global stock capitalization up from just 2 percent
in 1985. With the growing importance of the regional markets,
there is an increasing demand for a composite benchmark to gauge
their performance."
</P>
<P>
The eight constituent stock indexes are Hong Kong's Hang Seng
Index, the Jakarta Stock Exchange Composite Stock Price Index, the
 Korea Composite Stock Price Index, the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange Composite Index, the Philippine Stock Exchange Composite
Index, the Stock Exchange of Singapore All-Singapore Index, the
Stock Exchange of Thailand Index and the Taiwan Stock Exchange
Capitalization Weighted Stock Index.
</P>
<P>
All the constituent stock indexes are market
capitalization-weighted and among the most widely-quoted indexes
in the region. Each of them is being assigned a weighting within
the Index based on its respective stock market's aggregate
capitalization, so that it influences the Hang Seng Asia Index in
proportion to the size of the market it covers.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng Index is backdated to December 31, 1993, with a
base value of 1,000. It stood at 957.56 at the close of business
last Friday (on April 26).
</P>
<P>
The Index will be released at 6:15 p.m. Hong Kong time on each
trading day after the close of the eight markets. It will be
calculated on the days when half of the constituent indexes are
compiled. Constituent indexes of markets that are closed for
holidays will be kept at their previous closing levels. The index
will be widely disseminated through international and local data
services.

<HEADLINE> ADB to Improve Private Infrastructure Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
today held a seminar on "guarantees for private infrastructure
projects" in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The one-day seminar was attended by policy makers from the
bank's developing members as well as commercial and investment
bankers.
</P>
<P>
The seminar disseminated information, exchanged views and
obtained feedback on the guarantee policy so that the bank can
cope with market needs more effectively.
</P>
<P>
Asia's infrastructure requirements are vast and financing them
is a challenge to governments, capital markets, the private
sector, and the bank.
</P>
<P>
Innovative project financing mechanisms have to be developed in
order to attract the magnitude of financing required.
</P>
<P>
As part of its strategy to mobilize resources for the
development of its developing members, the ADB has adopted a new
guarantee policy in April 1995.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, the bank will provide sovereign risk
guarantee as well as traditional all-inclusive credit guarantee
for projects in its developing members.
</P>
<P>
Such guarantees are expected to play an important role in
credit-enhancement of the developing members and assist in the
mobilization of the necessary long-term capital for infrastructure
investments in the Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Holds Sixth Trial of Two Former Presidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korean President Chun
Doo-hwan admitted here today that the extensive merger of press
media in late 1980 was his idea.
</P>
<P>
Chun made the confession at the sixth trial session on mutiny
and treason charges involving Chun and another former President,
Roh Tae-woo, as well as some of their fellow generals and colonels
at the Seoul District Court this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Standing trial at the court were Chun and Roh as well as nine
close aides of Chun, including Hwang Young-shi, former first army
corps commander.
</P>
<P>
"The press merger plan was worked out by the then Information
Minister Lee Kwang-pyo, but the plan was my idea," Chun said in
the trial.
</P>
<P>
The disgraced former president, however, declined to talk about
the role of the Defense Security Command, headed then by Roh
Tae-woo, in the press merger. Roh's command was said to have
stage-managed the merger.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution also questioned Chun if he did not apply a sort
of indirect pressure to the justices of the Supreme Court so that
the highest court could mete out heavy term to opposition leader
Kim Dae-jung then on trial on sedition charges.
</P>
<P>
Chun ducked the question, saying that he could not remember the
action he took regarding the matter.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16 former South Korean army officers including Chun
and Roh have been indicted for mutiny and treason. The mutiny and
treason charges respectively stem from their roles in the military
revolt on December 12, 1979 and in the bloody crackdown of the
civil uprising on May 18, 1980 in Kwangju, capital of South
Korea's South Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who loomed large as the army strongman after the 1979
military mutiny, seized power on August 27, 1980, and ruled the
country until February 1988. He was followed by Roh, who stepped
down in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
The two ex-presidents, who were arrested last year, have also
been indicted for graft as they received huge bribes from
businessmen while in office.
</P>
<P>
Both Chun and Roh have already stood trial three times each
respectively on the graft charges.
</P>
<P>
The seventh trial session on mutiny and treason charges will be
held on May 6.

<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Construction show that the
total cost of housing decoration work nationwide exceeded 60
billion yuan in 1995, up 50 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
But even that only represents 60 percent of the nationwide
demand.
</P>
<P>
The fast-growing national economy and the steady rise in the
living standards of the Chinese people have created a demand for
comfortable and tasteful residential environments, according to
officials.
</P>
<P>
And more wage-earners, including workers, salespeople,
teachers, scientific and technological personnel and governmental
office staff can now afford well-decorated and well-equipped homes.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, the total savings deposits
of the country hit 3.3 trillion yuan in the first quarter of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Besides food, clothing and entertainment, ordinary Chinese
residents are spending more on decorating their houses.
</P>
<P>
In big cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Harbin,
Nanjing, Shenzhen and Zhuhai, over 40 percent of the urban
households have decorated their houses, at an average cost topping
15,000 yuan. The total cost of house decoration materials in
Beijing exceeded 1.5 billion yuan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 32 percent of the urban households in
medium-sized cities and 25 percent of those in county-level cities
have decorated their homes, with the average expenditure ranging
from 3,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Yao Yue'e, a 46-year-old textile worker in Shanghai, now lives
with her husband and daughter in a well-decorated apartment with
two bedrooms, a sitting room, a kitchen and a toilet. The
apartment boasts a parquet floor, graceful pendant lamps, plush
carpets, wallpaper and ornaments like fresh flowers and oil
paintings, in addition to a complete set of household electrical
appliances.
</P>
<P>
She said that all the married workers in her factory have moved
into new apartments with two rooms and a sitting room, benefiting
from the state's "comfortable housing" project, which is designed
to improve people's housing conditions. And all her neighbors have
decorated and modernized their houses, with expenditure on this
ranging from 10,000 to 50,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to the state's housing development plan for the
coming 20 years, China will complete the construction of new
residences with a total annual floor space of 200 million sq m,
and provide 4.5 million urban households facing housing
difficulties with an average of eight sq m in floor space each.
</P>
<P>
Experts here expect that by the year 2000 the country's total
housing floor space will hit five billion sq m, and a potential
total of 83 million apartments will be well-decorated, at a total
cost of 30 billion yuan each year.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, in the vast rural areas of the country housing
construction is proceeding at an even faster pace, completing 600
million sq m in floor space annually. It has become common for the
better-off farmers to live in stylish and well-equipped houses.
</P>
<P>
The experts estimate that the farmers will spend about 25
billion yuan in the coming five years to fit up their residences.
</P>
<P>
And the interior decoration sector, nurtured by people who are
getting better-off, will grow at a rate of over 50 percent in the
coming five years.

<HEADLINE> ADB to Enhance Human Development in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
today held a seminar to discuss the bank's support for human
development in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The one-day seminar provided an overview of the status of human
development in Asia today with a focus on the human priority
areas.
</P>
<P>
It also outlined the bank's strategies for human development
and discussed future directions and investment priorities.
</P>
<P>
The Asia and Pacific region is the most dynamic region within
the global economy.
</P>
<P>
However, of the more than 1 billion poor people in the
developing world, about 800 million are in Asia and about 500
million of these live in absolute poverty.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of the world's illiterates - more than 600
million people - live in Asia, and two-thirds of these are girls
and women.
</P>
<P>
More than two-thirds of the world's malnourished children live
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Although population growth rates have been declining in many
developing countries, population growth in Asia still accounts for
more than half of the yearly global population increase.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the Asian Development Bank has identified human
development (including population planning) as a strategic
development objective.
</P>
<P>
Within the broad concept of human development, the United
Nations Development Program identifies human priority areas to
include basic education, primary health care, safe drinking water,
adequate sanitation, family planning, and nutrition.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Meets Hong Kong Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen said here today that the Legislative Council
of the British Hong Kong government will be ended on June 30,
1997.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark when he met with a delegation of the Hong Kong
Professional Association of Industry and Commerce, headed by its
President Vincent Lo Hong-Sui.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the existing Legislative Council will be abolished
on June 30, 1997 with the termination of British rule of Hong
Kong, while the post-1997 Legislative Council of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) will be elected according to
the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it will not be a case of two legislatures existing
at the same time, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that establishing the Provisional Legislative
Council is the best way to deal with the "legal vacuum" when the
Hong Kong SAR is established, since the British side has sabotaged
the "through-train" arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The Provisional Legislative Council will pass some necessary
laws, and its tenure will end with the election of the first
SAR Legislative Council, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that he hoped more work would be done to let more
people get acquainted with the policies of the Chinese side so as
to dispel misunderstandings about the Provisional Legislative
Council in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
When questioned on the issue of the civil service, Qian said
that the Chinese side attaches great importance to it and welcomes
the vast number of the civil servants to remain in office and work
for the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
It is the common understanding between the Chinese and British
sides that the civil servants should support the Sino-British Joint
Declaration, the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR and the stable
transition and smooth transfer of power, he added.

<HEADLINE> Shop Showcasing Latest Telecom Services In Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Telecom, the oldest
telecommunications provider in the territory, today opened its
largest retail shop, which aims to offer integrated services of
up-to-date products, technologies and information.
</P>
<P>
According to Norman Yuen, deputy chief executive of Hong Kong
Telecom, customers are able to find advice and a full range of
telecommunications solutions to meet their specific needs in the
shop, which has 52 trained staff members.
</P>
<P>
Yuen said that the biggest problem facing customers today is
not the availability of the latest solution. The real issue is
helping them make a decision based on the latest information.
</P>
<P>
One floor of the four-storied shop is devoted to business
customers. ChinaLink 2000, a kind of new service just available
for one month, is a source of political and economic information
on China.
</P>
<P>
Tom Wang, manager of the shop, believed that more and more
Hong Kong businessmen would find the service helpful since China,
with a massive market and huge resources, has become a major
partner almost every enterprise wants to do business with.
</P>
<P>
A dozen of telephone services, including video-conferencing,
are shown in the shop. There are various telecommunications
equipment such as fax machines, telephone sets, mobile phones and
pagers.
</P>
<P>
The shop has brought to 32 the total number of Hong Kong
Telecom retail outlets in the territory.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Armed robbers in Lagos, largest
city of Nigeria, have resorted to gunning down unsuspecting
soldiers and policemen either on guard duty or other assignments
as a means of getting arms and ammunitions, the police said over
the weekend.
</P>

The Lagos State Commissioner of Police James Danbaba did not
give figures to show how many policemen and soldiers had been
robbed, but disclosed that 80 armed robbers had been eliminated
and 150 arrested in the last two months.

The police boss denied the allegation that some bad policemen
might be the likely sources of arms and ammunitions to the
daredevil armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
But it could not be ruled out totally, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that part of efforts to combat crime in the
state, more police stations were being built, adding that very
soon every community in the state would have a police station,

<HEADLINE> Israeli Newspapers Comment on Understanding Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli newspapers in their
comments on the ceasefire agreement of understanding between
Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon have offered approval but not high
marks for the government.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz, a Hebrew newspaper, commented in an editorial that
only the reality which develops along the northern border will
answer the central question of what Israel gained from the 17 days
of fighting in Operation Grapes of Wrath.
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper claimed that Israel has accomplished two
goals -- it restored the 1993 understandings and enhanced the
commitment of all parties involved to uphold them.
</P>
<P>
Davar Rishon, another Hebrew daily, noted that despite
political positioning over the outcome of the military operation
in Lebanon, "only the future will prove whether Grapes of Wrath
succeeded."
</P>
<P>
The paper welcomed the resumption of Israel's political
dialogue with both Syria and Lebanon. "Operation Grapes of Wrath
has again proven that the solution to the Lebanese problem is not
a military one. But if the campaign offers us a period of quiet
during which it will be possible to advance toward a political
settlement, it will then be viewed as a success," it noted.
</P>
<P>
Ma'arive, a Hebrew evening paper, suggested that the government
had no choice but to accept the understandings brokered by the
United States, putting an end to Operation Grapes of Wrath,
adding that with Israel's position coming under increasing attack,
another week or two of fighting would have only caused a further
erosion -- that would force Israel to settle for the same terms,
but on a much weaker footing.
</P>
<P>
While the situation on the ground now closely resembles that
which followed Operation Accountability, the editors held that
Israel has suffered a diplomatic setback.
</P>
<P>
In the editors' opinion, public expectations from the military
action were too high, and the temporary calm may again
deteriorate into violence if peace treaties are not signed with
Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Ahronot, another Hebrew evening paper, stated in its
editorial that Israel did not succeed in teaching Hezbollah a
lesson it will never forget, and the final accounting is
inconclusive as to whether Israel was successful in its endeavor.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post, Israel's only English-language daily,
expressed more critical views about the ceasefire. The pro-right
wing paper said, "If there is one achievement (U.S. Secretary of
State Warren) Christopher can boast, it is that he has apparently
managed to convince Syrian dictator Hafez al-Assad that it would
be advantageous for him to calm the Lebanese border for a while."
</P>
<P>
"The administration has made no secret of its belief that the
negotiation process will benefit if (Shimon) Peres, who has
agreed to relinquish the Golan (Heights), is elected prime
minister. And if al-Assad has been persuaded that his chances of
getting Israel to withdraw to the June 4, 1967 lines will be
enhanced by Peres' election, he may indeed keep the northern
border quiet for the next few weeks," said the paper.

<HEADLINE> FAO Chief Calls For Global Anti-Hunger Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) Director-General Jacques Diouf today urged the
entire world to take actions against hunger and malnutrition to
ensure the fundamental human right to food.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the 20th FAO Regional
Conference for Europe in Tel Aviv this morning, Diouf said the
world's major challenges, like access to food and water with their
ethical, political and strategic dimensions, "could lead to
extremely violent and serious conflict unless we put things right."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized Europe's responsibility to food security in the
developing countries and to investment and international trade.
</P>
<P>
Although there is enough food to feed everyone in the world,
Diouf said, its distribution remains terribly skewed.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly 800 million people are chronically undernourished, and
some 200 million children under the age of five are affected by
acute or chronic protein and calorie deficiency," he revealed.
</P>
<P>
According to the FAO chief, the world's current grain reserves
have fallen below the level considered necessary to guarantee the
global food security. "World market prices are soaring and the
low-income, food-deficit countries will have to pay additional 3
billion U.S. dollars this year for their food imports," ha said.
</P>
<P>
Diouf said that Europe exports large quantities of grains to
food-deficit countries and is one of the largest providers of
food aid.
</P>
<P>
However, the FAO Director-General warned, in the context of
recession and unemployment, poverty and exclusion are tending to
gain ground in certain countries of the region.

determined to further strengthen its trade and economic ties with
Guyana so as to push forward the overall development of bilateral

and bilateral co-operation in trade and economy has made some
achievements.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Guyana is willing to help China gain access to the markets in
the Caribbean and North American areas.
</P>
<P>

co-operation with Caribbean countries, for the majority of them
are developing countries and they shared a common aspiration of
developing economies.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to establish a long-term, stable and friendly
co-operative relationship with Caribbean countries, Qian said.

<HEADLINE> Macao Governor Signs Order on Localization of Civil Servants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira
has signed a new order urging the localization of civil servants,
and the order will be promulgated soon.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua has learned that the new order, which consists of 12
items, rules that all positions of chiefs of sections and heads of
 groups of Macao Government must be held by local permanent
residents by December 31, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Those who are non-permanent residents of Macao but currently
hold such positions will be replaced by the year end. Exceptions
must get special approval of the governor, according to the
order.
</P>
<P>
The order also states the next step in the localization
procedure, and says that the stability of the civil servants of
the government will enjoy top priority.
</P>
<P>
The total number of civil servants should not exceed that of
July 1, 1995, but government departments can fill vacancies this
year.
</P>
<P>
The order stressed that the government hopes the leading
positions of the civil servants will be held by local people or
those who have chosen to remain in Macao after 1999 so that no
power vacuum may occur in the handover of power.
</P>
<P>
Macao has more than 15,000 civil servants now. The localization
 process began in 1987 after a joint declaration on Macao was
signed by the Portuguese and Chinese governments.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins in HK Waters Genetically Strong: Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese white dolphins in Hong
Kong's polluted waters are genetically strong and show no sign of
inbreeding despite the relatively small population, a research has
 found.
</P>
<P>
Today's Eastern Express reported that DNA analysis has revealed
 that the dolphins, believed to number between 80 and 200, are not
 a unique species, but a distinct genetic group.
</P>
<P>
Researcher Lindsay Porter said different sousa dolphin
populations in the world are all one species but they have been
separated by geography, and through time for so long it is highly
likely they are distinct genetic stock.
</P>
<P>
The genetic research will examine 50 tissue samples from sousa
species in the region including those in Thailand, Vietnam and
China, as well as in Australia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, genetic fingerprinting revealed
variations among Hong Kong's dolphins, which is believed a good
thing for a population because it makes them more adaptable to
changes in the environment.
</P>
<P>
"It is healthy and well that breeding groups are mixing and
there is no inbreeding," Porter said.
</P>
<P>
Researchers have samples of sousa tissue from Xiamen in China
and are seeking DNA from other populations.
</P>
<P>
Porter plans to scour Chinese waters just outside Hong Kong
this summer to assess dolphin distribution, the report
said.

ULAN BATOR, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen people have been
killed, 34 injured and hundreds of others forced to flee their
homes by forest and grassland fires which have been raging across
Mongolia for weeks, a senior government official said today.
</P>
<P>
The 72 fires, which have spread to 13 of the 21 Mongolian
provinces, have also killed more than 5,000 animals, destroyed 117
tents, 191 farms and 667 wire poles, the official said.
</P>
<P>
More than 24,000 people and 1,000 vehicles have been sent in to
put out the fires and the government has so far spent 374 million
tugriks (800,000 U.S. dollars) on the rescue operation, said
Bayala, secretary-general of Mongolia's Standing Emergency
Commission in charge of fire-fighting and relief work.
</P>
<P>
He said that President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat and Prime
Minister Puntsagiyn Jasray today called on the whole nation to
help control and put out the fierce fires.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia has appealed for international emergency assistance in
fighting the fires.
</P>
<P>
The northwestern province of Bulgan is the hardest-hit, with 25
forests and acres of pasture land ablaze, followed by Khobsgol and
Tub provinces, stricken by 12 fires and 9 fires respectively,
Bayala said.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen percent of Mongolia, the world's largest landlocked
country, is covered by forests and 80 percent - 1.2 million square
kilometers - by grassland, the sixth largest area in the world.

PRETORIA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- "The South African people will
never forget the support by the Chinese people during their
struggle against apartheid," South African Foreign Minister
Alfred Nzo said here today.
</P>
<P>
Nzo made the remarks in an interview with Chinese Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Ms Wu Yi who is leading a
delegation to attend the ninth session of the UN Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD IX) held in Johannesburg from April
27 to May 11.
</P>
<P>
Warmly shaking hands with Ms Wu at the Union Building here,
Nzo said, "you're most welcome."
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the profound friendship forged between the
South African and Chinese peoples in the course of the fight
against racism, saying, "it was precisely due to the support
rendered by the international community including China's that
the South African people won their historic victory."
</P>
<P>
For this President Nelson Mandela has on many occasions
publicly thanked China for her support, said Nzo, noting that the
Chinese government had been firm since the 1950s in backing the
South African people in their just struggle against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
"Both China and South Africa can play an important role in the
international community," said Nzo, who, at 73, looked healthy.
</P>
<P>
He said he had paid a visit to China last month to discuss
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Ms Wu said, "the South African government of
national unity under the leadership of President Nelson Mandela
has gained fine results in realizing national reconciliation and
revitalizing the economy."
</P>
<P>
"Last year, the growth of South Africa's economy reached the
best level in ten years," Ms Wu said.
</P>
<P>
She told Nzo that bilateral trade grew very fast and that a
number of Chinese companies and enterprises had invested in South
Africa and still more would come as they showed great interest in
this country.
</P>
<P>
The two countries had traditional friendship, Ms Wu stressed,
adding, "after the founding of New China in 1949, Chairman Mao
Zedong sent a message, on behalf of the Chinese people, voicing
support to the struggle of the South African people against
apartheid."
</P>
<P>
She said she was happy to meet "Alfred Nzo, an old friend"
during the UNTAD sessions, saying, "China wishes to further
promote trade and economic ties with South Africa."
</P>
<P>
Ms Wu also conveyed to Nzo the greetings from Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.
</P>
<P>
Nzo paid a three-day working visit to Beijing late last month
where President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, Vice-Premier Qian
and Ms Wu received him respectively on bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that a South African Foreign Minister
visited China.
</P>
<P>
A local newspaper "The Star" today commented on Ms Wu's visit
when it says, South Africa has come to understand that Taiwan is
merely a province of China and that it is impossible to give
recognition to both.

<HEADLINE> New Chechen Rebel Leader Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The new Chechen separatist leader,
Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, was killed on Sunday night in a clash
between Chechen rebels, just a week after taking over from slain
leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, the Itar-Tass news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Yandarbiyev was killed overnight in a clash between warring
Chechen militants near the settlement of Urus-Matan, 20 kilometers
south of the Chechen capital Grozny, the agency quoted Ruslan
Martagov, spokesman for Chechen pro-Moscow leader Doku Zavgayev,
as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the 44-year-old Yandarbiyev's death was not
immediately confirmed by the rebels themselves. But Russian news
agencies said this would suggest that the Chechen rebels, now
devoid of Dudayev's unifying leadership, might be splintering into
rival factions.
</P>
<P>
Yandarbiyev was vice-president of former Chechen separatist
leader Dzhokhar Dudayev's regime. He was appointed acting
president by a rebel military council shortly after Dudayev was
killed in a rocket attack on April 21.
</P>
<P>
He was the author of several books, but switched to politics
in 1990 and has been seen as an ideologist in the separatist
movement in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In his first interview with reporters after he took over from
the killed Dudayev, Yandarbiyev pledged to continue fighting for
Chechnya's independence from Russia. More than 30,000 people have
been killed in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin launched a peace plan for
Chechnya on March 31, which included talks with Dudayev. The death
of both leaders could complicate peace talks with Moscow.

</P>
<P>
Although there is enough food to feed everyone in the world,
Diouf said, its distribution remains terribly skewed.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly 800 million people are chronically undernourished, and
some 200 million children under the age of five are affected by
acute or chronic protein and calorie deficiency," he revealed.
</P>
<P>
According to the FAO chief, the world's current grain reserves
have fallen below the level considered necessary to guarantee the
global food security. "World market prices are soaring and the
low-income, food-deficit countries will have to pay additional 3
billion U.S. dollars this year for their food imports," ha said.
</P>
<P>
Diouf said that Europe exports large quantities of grains to
food-deficit countries and is one of the largest providers of
food aid.
</P>
<P>
However, the FAO Director-General warned, in the context of
recession and unemployment, poverty and exclusion are tending to
gain ground in certain countries of the region.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Newspapers Comment on Understanding Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli newspapers in their
comments on the ceasefire agreement of understanding between
Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon have offered approval but not high
marks for the government.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz, a Hebrew newspaper, commented in an editorial that
only the reality which develops along the northern border will
answer the central question of what Israel gained from the 17 days
of fighting in Operation Grapes of Wrath.
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper claimed that Israel has accomplished two
goals -- it restored the 1993 understandings and enhanced the
commitment of all parties involved to uphold them.
</P>
<P>
Davar Rishon, another Hebrew daily, noted that despite
political positioning over the outcome of the military operation
in Lebanon, "only the future will prove whether Grapes of Wrath
succeeded."
</P>
<P>
The paper welcomed the resumption of Israel's political
dialogue with both Syria and Lebanon. "Operation Grapes of Wrath
has again proven that the solution to the Lebanese problem is not
a military one. But if the campaign offers us a period of quiet
during which it will be possible to advance toward a political
settlement, it will then be viewed as a success," it noted.
</P>
<P>
Ma'arive, a Hebrew evening paper, suggested that the government
had no choice but to accept the understandings brokered by the
United States, putting an end to Operation Grapes of Wrath,
adding that with Israel's position coming under increasing attack,
another week or two of fighting would have only caused a further
erosion -- that would force Israel to settle for the same terms,
but on a much weaker footing.
</P>
<P>
While the situation on the ground now closely resembles that
which followed Operation Accountability, the editors held that
Israel has suffered a diplomatic setback.
</P>
<P>
In the editors' opinion, public expectations from the military
action were too high, and the temporary calm may again
deteriorate into violence if peace treaties are not signed with
Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Ahronot, another Hebrew evening paper, stated in its
editorial that Israel did not succeed in teaching Hezbollah a
lesson it will never forget, and the final accounting is
inconclusive as to whether Israel was successful in its endeavor.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post, Israel's only English-language daily,
expressed more critical views about the ceasefire. The pro-right
wing paper said, "If there is one achievement (U.S. Secretary of
State Warren) Christopher can boast, it is that he has apparently
managed to convince Syrian dictator Hafez al-Assad that it would
be advantageous for him to calm the Lebanese border for a while."
</P>
<P>
"The administration has made no secret of its belief that the
negotiation process will benefit if (Shimon) Peres, who has
agreed to relinquish the Golan (Heights), is elected prime
minister. And if al-Assad has been persuaded that his chances of
getting Israel to withdraw to the June 4, 1967 lines will be
enhanced by Peres' election, he may indeed keep the northern
border quiet for the next few weeks," said the paper.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Continues to Cut Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia is continuing to
adopt a policy of spending cuts and other steps to reduce its
budget deficit in 1996, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The expenditure of the oil-rich Kingdom in 1996 was put at 40
billion U.S. dollars and the revenues at 35 billion dollars,
leaving a 5 billion dollars budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has launched reforms to restore balance to its
budget and economy after it was hit by low prices of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Today's Khaleej Times based here quoted Saudi Finance and
National Economy Minister Ibrahim Bin Abdel Aziz al-Assaf as
saying that the Kingdom "is continuing its efforts in supporting
the growth of the national economy through diversifying its
sources of income and encouraging initiatives from the private
sector as well as lessening government spending."
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP) of Saudi Arabia grew by 4.3
percent in 1995 compared with 1.4 percent in 1994, according to
an earlier report.
</P>
<P>
With a proven oil reserve of some 260 billion barrels,
accounting for more than a quarter of the world's total, Saudi
Arabia produces some 8 million barrels of crude oil per day, about
12 percent of the world's total output.

LAGOS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen distressed banks taken
over last year by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) are slated
for the auction block, bringing the number of institutions on

investments. Subsequently, it appointed an interim management
board for each of the distressed banks to coordinate its
activities.

As non of the banks has been able to recapitalize despite the
grace period granted them by CBN, the next step is to acquire and
sell them to investors, CBN spokesman Tony Ede was quoted as

<HEADLINE> Stronger China Vital For Peace, Says OAU Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Africa would like to see a
stronger and more economically developed China for peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) Secretary General, Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim, in a recent
interview with Chinese journalists.
</P>
<P>
In his office at the OAU Headquarters in Addis Ababa, the
capital of Ethiopia, Dr. Salim said:
</P>
<P>
"We, as a friend of Chinese people, believe a stronger, a
more stable and a more economically developed China will
enhance and promote peace and stability in the region."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Salim, an old friend of the Chinese people, had been
Tanzania's ambassador to China before being appointed Minister
of Foreign Affairs and Prime Minister of the Tanzanian United
Republic in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
He was elected OAU Secretary General in 1989 and
re-elected to the post in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief spoke highly of relations between China and
African countries.
</P>
<P>
When Africa was in difficulties in her struggle against
colonialism and apartheid, China was proved to be one
of the most important supporters of the African people, Dr Salim
said.
</P>
<P>
This support has not been confined to political affairs, he
said, adding the Sino-African cooperation has turned out to be
exemplary in technical assistance, joint management of key
projects and other socio-economic aspects.
</P>
<P>
"We want the Chinese people to understand that we have always
valued their friendship" characterized by equality and mutual
respect for each other and understanding of African problems, he
told the Chinese journalists.
</P>
<P>
On the forthcoming visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin to
Africa, the ever first by the Chinese leader to the
continent, Dr. Salim said he is looking forward to discussions
with the Chinese president on the strengthening of the
Sino-African ties.
</P>
<P>
Talks might be focused on the ways to enhance cooperation between
the OAU and China, which in the past supported Africa's cause of
liberation through the OAU's Liberation Committee, according to
Dr. Salim.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief is planning to invite all African diplomatic
corps in Addis Ababa to an address by the Chinese president at
the Africa Hall.
</P>
<P>
"When he addresses the Africa Hall here, he will be addressing
the whole Africa," said Dr. Salim.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Chinese president's tour of Africa
"comes at a time when Africa itself is going through challenges.
It signifies China's understanding and recognition of the role of
Africa in the international system."

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- In terms of the role by the
OAU in the past 33 years, Dr. Salim said the organization had
focused its efforts on the African liberation and struggle
against colonialism and apartheid from 1963 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
If there is a success story for the OAU, it has been the
decolonization in Africa, he concluded, noting that today a free
Africa should take as her new priority the economic and social
development in the continent.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, a key lies in regional and continental
economic integration.
</P>
<P>
That is why African countries agreed to form the African
Economic Community in 1991 in the Nigerian capital Abuja,
according to the OAU chief.
</P>
<P>
Bread and butter, that is something to preoccupy the agenda of
the OAU, he said.
</P>
<P>
How to make better the lives of the African people in the
economic, social, health, political and cultural aspects is,
where the OAU now focusing, a second liberation for Africa, in
his words.
</P>
<P>
To ensure all that, security and stability of the African
continent is a must.
</P>
<P>
Everybody recognizes that Africa cannot achieve economic
development without stability and security, Dr Salim said.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the OAU has to push forward with a dream of
development amid the current conflicts among and within African
countries, he indicated.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the OAU is now more and more dealing with issues
other than the economic development, such as the crises in
Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi, and Liberia, where conflicts have
caused millions of casualties and refugees.
</P>
<P>
"We know that without development, we cannot have peace and
without peace we cannot have development," Dr Salim said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the OAU set up the special Mechanism for Conflict
Prevention, Management and Resolution in the continent in 1993,
he added.
</P>
<P>
While the mechanism has achieved some encouraging results in
its three-year operation, it suffers the lack of sufficient
resources.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief called upon the international community to
support Africa's efforts for its access to the sources.
</P>
<P>
He also advocated introducing political education in African
countries to popularize "culture of peace, culture of tolerance
and culture of understanding" in the continent.

<HEADLINE> Stronger China Vital For Peace, Says OAU Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Africa would like to see a
stronger and more economically developed China for peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) Secretary General, Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim, in a recent
interview with Chinese journalists.
</P>
<P>
In his office at the OAU Headquarters in Addis Ababa, the
capital of Ethiopia, Dr. Salim said:
</P>
<P>
"We, as a friend of Chinese people, believe a stronger, a
more stable and a more economically developed China will
enhance and promote peace and stability in the region."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Salim, an old friend of the Chinese people, had been
Tanzania's ambassador to China before being appointed Minister
of Foreign Affairs and Prime Minister of the Tanzanian United
Republic in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
He was elected OAU Secretary General in 1989 and
re-elected to the post in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief spoke highly of relations between China and
African countries.
</P>
<P>
When Africa was in difficulties in her struggle against
colonialism and apartheid, China was proved to be one
of the most important supporters of the African people, Dr Salim
said.
</P>
<P>
This support has not been confined to political affairs, he
said, adding the Sino-African cooperation has turned out to be
exemplary in technical assistance, joint management of key
projects and other socio-economic aspects.
</P>
<P>
"We want the Chinese people to understand that we have always
valued their friendship" characterized by equality and mutual
respect for each other and understanding of African problems, he
told the Chinese journalists.
</P>
<P>
On the forthcoming visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin to
Africa, the ever first by the Chinese leader to the
continent, Dr. Salim said he is looking forward to discussions
with the Chinese president on the strengthening of the
Sino-African ties.
</P>
<P>
Talks might be focused on the ways to enhance cooperation between
the OAU and China, which in the past supported Africa's cause of
liberation through the OAU's Liberation Committee, according to
Dr. Salim.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief is planning to invite all African diplomatic
corps in Addis Ababa to an address by the Chinese president at
the Africa Hall.
</P>
<P>
"When he addresses the Africa Hall here, he will be addressing
the whole Africa," said Dr. Salim.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Chinese president's tour of Africa
"comes at a time when Africa itself is going through challenges.
It signifies China's understanding and recognition of the role of
Africa in the international system."

<HEADLINE> Plane With Two Foreigners Detained At Kismaio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Militiamen loyal to General
Mohamed Said Hirsi have detained a small plane which they accused
of illegally landing at Kismaio airport, South Somalia, on
Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
The plane was transporting a Somali deportee from the
Scandinavian country of Sweden, said reports from Kismaio, 500
kilometers south of Mogadishu, by quoting Sheikh Abdurahman

plane is being fined at 8,500 US Dollars for its release, while
the two foreigners will be tried separately for charges of
illegally entering in Kismaio.

This small plane is believed to have been hired by the Swedish
Embassy in Kenya. According to Sheikh Jibriil, the plane will not
be released until it pays the fine.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The two leaders were believed to deal with, among other things,

</P>

ISLAMABAD, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Acting President
Wasim Sajjad today directed the Punjab provincial government to
make all-out efforts to arrest those responsible for the bomb
blast in a bus on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen in Lahore after visiting hospitals which
received victims of the blast, Sajjad said that it was premature
to fix responsibility for the blast on anyone at this juncture
unless a thorough probe was carried out.
</P>
<P>
A high-intensity bomb which was planted in a crowded bus went
off at a bus stop, about 50 kilometers away from Lahore, killing
more than 70 persons and injuring 37 others on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Now, the investigation was going on, Sajjad said, adding that
whoever planted the bomb in the bus is a cold-blooded person.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was shocked at the attack and directed the
Punjab government to take strict measures to curb the acts of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He also directed the directors of the hospitals to provide
special medical treatment to the injured free of charge.

<HEADLINE> More Banks Offered For Sale In Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen distressed banks taken
over last year by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) are slated
for the auction block, bringing the number of institutions on
offer to 22, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
CBN previously offered for sale six banks, all of which were
formerly owned by state governments.
</P>
<P>
The latest decision is expected to be effected after August
this year, when the extended tenure of interim management boards
appointed for the banks expires.
</P>
<P>
CBN has resolved to put the additional 17 banks, eight
commercial banks and nine merchant banks, on offer following
their inability to recapitalize.
</P>
<P>
CBN took the 17 banks on september 15, 1995 when it gave their
shareholders a 30-day ultimatum to recapitalize or lose their
investments. Subsequently, it appointed an interim management
board for each of the distressed banks to coordinate its
activities.
</P>
<P>
As non of the banks has been able to recapitalize despite the
grace period granted them by CBN, the next step is to acquire and
sell them to investors, CBN spokesman Tony Ede was quoted as
saying here over the weekend.

exemplary in technical assistance, joint management of key

<P>
Talks might be focused on the ways to enhance cooperation between
the OAU and China, which in the past supported Africa's cause of
liberation through the OAU's Liberation Committee, according to
Dr. Salim.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief is planning to invite all African diplomatic
corps in Addis Ababa to an address by the Chinese president at

"When he addresses the Africa Hall here, he will be addressing
the whole Africa," said Dr. Salim.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Chinese president's tour of Africa
"comes at a time when Africa itself is going through challenges.
It signifies China's understanding and recognition of the role of
Africa in the international system."

<HEADLINE> Stronger China Vital For Peace, Says OAU Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- In terms of the role by the
OAU in the past 33 years, Dr. Salim said the organization had
focused its efforts on the African liberation and struggle
against colonialism and apartheid from 1963 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
If there is a success story for the OAU, it has been the
decolonization in Africa, he concluded, noting that today a free
Africa should take as her new priority the economic and social
development in the continent.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, a key lies in regional and continental
economic integration.
</P>
<P>
That is why African countries agreed to form the African
Economic Community in 1991 in the Nigerian capital Abuja,
according to the OAU chief.
</P>
<P>
Bread and butter, that is something to preoccupy the agenda of
the OAU, he said.
</P>
<P>
How to make better the lives of the African people in the
economic, social, health, political and cultural aspects is,
where the OAU now focusing, a second liberation for Africa, in
his words.
</P>
<P>
To ensure all that, security and stability of the African
continent is a must.
</P>
<P>
Everybody recognizes that Africa cannot achieve economic
development without stability and security, Dr Salim said.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the OAU has to push forward with a dream of
development amid the current conflicts among and within African
countries, he indicated.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the OAU is now more and more dealing with issues
other than the economic development, such as the crises in
Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi, and Liberia, where conflicts have
caused millions of casualties and refugees.
</P>
<P>
"We know that without development, we cannot have peace and
without peace we cannot have development," Dr Salim said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the OAU set up the special Mechanism for Conflict
Prevention, Management and Resolution in the continent in 1993,
he added.
</P>
<P>
While the mechanism has achieved some encouraging results in
its three-year operation, it suffers the lack of sufficient
resources.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief called upon the international community to
support Africa's efforts for its access to the sources.
</P>
<P>
He also advocated introducing political education in African
countries to popularize "culture of peace, culture of tolerance
and culture of understanding" in the continent.

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Beggars Reported in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The number of beggars coming to
Thailand from neighboring countries posted 1,200 in 1995,
registering an increase of 15.6 percent over the previous year,
according to the Thai Farmers Research Center.
</P>
<P>
Of the 550 beggars arrested last year, 461 were Cambodians and
the others came from Myanmar, most of them are women and children,
the center said.
</P>
<P>
The center said that the beggars were classified into three
groups -- temporary, free and professional.
</P>
<P>
The temporary group, mainly tourists who have been robbed or
run out money, was begging to make enough money to go home.
</P>
<P>
The group of free beggars, mainly those without regular jobs,
slipped to Thailand to beg for survival.
</P>
<P>
The third category is professional beggars who came to Thailand
specially for making money. Some of these beggars were brought in
by agents who give them accommodation and security as well as food
and transport.
</P>
<P>
The center pointed out that the begging business has grown
rapidly in recent years because the amount of money made from
panhandling often surpasses the income from manual labor and other
low wage jobs.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Eradicate Leprosy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- An estimate by the Ministry of
Public Health showed that there are still about 15,000 lepers who
have not been detected throughout Vietnam, official report here
said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to international assistance, 32,194 lepers have been
cured while 55,400 others are currently under treatment, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Health has received 500,000 U.S. dollars
each year for leprosy treatment and prevention from the World
Health Organisation, the governments of the Netherlands, Belgium,
Japan, Germany and South Korea since 1985.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to eradicate leprosy by the turn of the century,
the Vietnamese government has launched a nationwide anti-leprosy
programme.
</P>
<P>
Under the programme, efforts shall be made to detect and treat
leprosy through community-based health care network.
</P>
<P>
Integration of post-leprosy patients back into their community
is another goal of the programme.
</P>
<P>
At present, 4,000 leprosy sufferers, most of them old,
disabled, and lonely, are being treated at 21 leprosy centres
which are to be reorganised for better treatment and care.
</P>
<P>
The upgrade of these centres and the provision of startup
capital to post-treatment lepers to integrate into the community
is estimated to cost at least some 40 billion vnd (roughly 3.6
million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Stable ties Among China, Japan, US Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A veteran Chinese diplomat has
called for the establishment of long-term and stable triangular
relations between China, Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
He says the three-way relationship will help maintain stability
and development in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiangshan, vice-president of the China Association for
International Understanding made the remarks at the two-day
Sino-Japanese Symposium on The Situation and Peace in Asia, which
concluded today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In Asia and the Asian-Pacific region, China, Japan and the
United States are three countries of vital importance, he said,
adding that if the triangular relationship focussed on China,
Japan and the United States, and their respective bilateral
relations develop as good, cooperative and forward-looking, the
whole of Asia will benefit from it.
</P>
<P>
Whereas an abnormal, antagonistic and backward relationship
among the three countries will make all of Asia suffer, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
At present, Asia is witnessing a comparative stable situation
and rapid economic development, Zhang said, adding that this is
also due to the active role played by China, Japan and ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, this does not mean a calm Asia, nor smooth
sailing in the future. Therefore, people of the current generation
should correctly handle the triangular among and bilateral
relations between the three countries, to bring a peaceful, stable
and prosperous Asia into the next century, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Japanese Symposium attracted scores of Chinese and
Japanese scholars as well as experts on international issues. The
Japanese delegation was headed by Senators Yatabe Osamu and Komori

<HEADLINE> Tamil Rebels' Front Group Calls for Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 29 (Xinhua)-- A front organization for the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) called for an immediate
ceasefire and peace talks with the government, local evening
newspaper The Observer reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization
(TRO), regarded as a front for the LTTE, asked the international
community to pressure the Sri Lankan government into negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful that the international community will act now
to bring an immediate end to the onslaught on the Tamil people and
restart negotiations between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan
government," the report quoting a statement issued from the TRO's
office in Australia as saying.
</P>
<P>
The TRO said in the statement that the LTTE had indicated their
willingness to negotiate with the government of President
Chandrika Kumaratunga in the presence of a neutral international
third party.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE, which has been fighting for a separate Tamil state in
the north and east of the country, conducted nearly six months of
talks with the government but abruptly pulled out and resumed
hostilities a year ago.
</P>
<P>
During stage I of the Operation Riviresa, government troops
re-captured several districts including Jaffna city on the
peninsula under the LTTE control. Over 2,500 LTTE rebels were
reportedly killed and about 5,000 injured.
</P>
<P>
Government troops at present are continuing their offensive
codenamed Operation Riviresa II to liberate those areas in the
Jaffna peninsula still under the LTTE control. So far, over 250
LTTE rebels were killed in the operation, which was launched on
April 19 in the peninsula, according to military figures.

<HEADLINE> Port Arthur Gunman, A Lone Farmer, Neighbors Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Neighbors of the Tasmanian
gunman responsible for the massacre of 33 people said that the man
was a person with strange behaviors.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported from Melbourne
that the gunman used to own a farm at Copping, 40 km north of Port
Arthur.
</P>
<P>
The man shot dead 32 persons at Port Arthur in the southern tip
of Tasmania early Sunday afternoon. Police have found another body
in the fire-destroyed guest house where he held hostages today,
bringing the death toll to 33.
</P>
<P>
Neighbors identified the gunman as "Martin," AAP reported.
</P>
<P>
They said that he moved into the farm about four years ago. He
used to warn the neighbors not to get on his property or he would
shoot them, neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
Veina Featherstone, one of Martin's former neighbors, recalled
that the man slept all day and walked around his property and
other people's properties at night.
</P>
<P>
"He fired a gun off at night," she said.
</P>
<P>
"One minute he would be all right, and then he wouldn't be,"
said another neighbor who had talked to the man several times.
</P>
<P>
"He would go off -- he would be a totally different person,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The neighbors said that Martin's father was drowned at a dam on
the farm in a suspect suicide case three years ago. But the gunman
was at work just half an hour after his father's body was pulled
out of water.
</P>
<P>
They said that there was a woman in her 50s living with the
gunman on the farm. The woman told them that she looked after the
gunman as a mother. The woman was killed in a car accident when
she drove with the gunman one year after they moved to the farm.
</P>
<P>
The man inherited the woman's property and sold it 18 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
Private inquiries had confirmed the man had a house in Newtown
in suburb Hobart, capital city of Tasmania state.
</P>
<P>
Police have contacted with the gunman's mother, one uncle and
his girlfriend. They refused to give details of the man's address
except that he was a Tasmanian from Hobart.
</P>
<P>
Tasmania's Deputy Police Commissioner Richard McCreadie
confirmed that the man was in his late 20s. He had never had a gun
license and had no history of owning firearms.
</P>
<P>
Police found that the man had visited the Seascape guest house
at Port Arthur many times because the couple who own the house
were friends of his late father.
</P>
<P>
He chose the guest house as the place of holding hostages
because he was aware of a large cache of arms and ammunitions at
Seascape, AAP reported.
</P>
<P>
Police said that they were not sure how many hostages had been
held by the gunman. There are still two people unaccounted for.
The body found in the rubble of the guest house was yet to be
identified, police said.
</P>
<P>
The owners of the guest house, David and Sally Martin, who are
in their 60s, are believed to be among the three hostages held by
the gunman before he set fire on the house this morning.

<HEADLINE> Local Township Tops in Button Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Gigi Redolfi, sales director of
Italy's Tullio Giusi, the world's biggest button-machinery
producer, has visited a little township in Hangzhou, a well-known
scenic spot in east China's Jiangsu Province, twice this year, and
is quite interested in it.
</P>
<P>
The township, Qiaotou, does not have any of the beauty of
Hangzhou, but Redolfi was there on business, concerned most with
the fact that the township is the country's largest button
producer.
</P>
<P>
It produced 15 billion buttons last year, supplying 85 percent
of the country's demand.
</P>
<P>
About five million domestic and overseas businessmen visited
the township last year to talk about one of the smallest items
that sales counters anywhere offer.
</P>
<P>
In the center of the township is an 80,000-sq-m building with
nearly 3,000 sales booths and more than 5,000 types of buttons.
</P>
<P>
Total sales last year reached 1.6 billion yuan, and the average
annual income of local people was up to 10,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The button business did not exist in the township until the
late 1970s, but it had a strange and dramatic start, ultimately
turning the township into the country's major button producer. It
was just a few years ago that the average annual income of local
farmers was below 500 yuan, and most of the men had to go far away
to earn extra money for their families.
</P>
<P>
Local people were skilled in working on cotton-padded quilts,
so husbands would travel around doing that work while wives stayed
home and took care of their families.
</P>
<P>
Two farmers who had to leave home to make a living found some
buttons in a garbage dump at a button factory in Suzhou City, and
gathered some buttons up to take back home.
</P>
<P>
They started selling buttons in their hometown and managed to
make quite a bit of money.
</P>
<P>
When word of this spread, nearly 2,000 men who had been running
around the country looking for work, turned to the button business
and brought back all kinds from buttons from factories across the
country to their home town.
</P>
<P>
The button industry started growing in the township. Husbands
gave up the cotton-padding business and established button
workshops, pulling nearly all the family members into the
business. The wives sold buttons in the local market.
</P>
<P>
By now there are 5,100 local people engaged in button sales,
nearly 70 percent of whom are women.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiangshu, a farmer who turned to the button business about
ten years ago and manages a five-sq-m booth in the market, told
this reporter that he can earn 300 yuan a day.
</P>
<P>
There are five major enterprises in the township, with an
annual production capacity of more than 200 million buttons
each. One of them, the Mailida Light Industrial Co., Ltd, is a
foreign-funded venture established four years ago, which produced
270 million buttons last year.
</P>
<P>
The local government has developed some measures to encourage
foreigners to invest in the sector, and a button research
institute and button museum will be built.
</P>
<P>
Redolfi's comment was, "I have never seen a place that has so
many button factories, and so big a market."

<P>
TOKYO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Alimi Goitia of Venezuela beat
Japanese challenger Satoshi Iida on technical knockout in Nagoya,
of Japan on Monday to retain his World Boxing Association junior
bantamweight title.
</P>
<P>
Goitia, a 25-year-old left-hander, delivered a powerful right
hook in the fourth round to floor Iida.
</P>
<P>
Iida was apparently no match to Goitia in the fifth round, when
Goitia moved closer with harder punches and Iida could only pose
little defence.
</P>
<P>
British referee John Coyle stopped the bout 25 seconds into the
round, giving Goitia his third successful defence of his title.
</P>
<P>
Goitia, who defeated South Korea's Lee Hyung Chol last June for
the crown, extended his winning streak to 15 matches.
</P>
<P>
This was Iida's first loss after winning 20 successive
professional fights.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Ex-President's Aides to Be Imprisoned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean prosecution today
demanded prison terms ranging from five to seven years for four
accused in connection with the bribery scandal involving former
President Chun Doo-hwan.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution's demands came in the third trial session of
Chun's graft case held at the Seoul District Court this morning.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors demanded that Ahn Hyun-tae, former chief
presidential bodyguard, be sentenced to a seven-year imprisonment
and an additional fine of 64,000 U.S. dollars on charges of aiding
Chun to collect 35.9 million dollars in bribes from businessmen
and receiving 64,000 U.S. dollars in bribes himself.
</P>
<P>
Sung Yong-wook, a former national tax administrator charged of
aiding Chun to collect 35.9 million U.S. dollars from two
companies and collecting himself 6.99 million dollars from 11
companies for it to be conveyed to Chun, was demanded to be given
six years in prison and an additional fine of 2.33 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A five-year imprisonment and an additional fine of 2.33 million
dollars was demanded for Ahn Moo-hyuk, former director of the
Agency for National Security Planning, while a five-year
imprisonment alone was demanded for Sagong Il, former finance
minister.
</P>
<P>
Ahn Hyun-tae testified at today's hearing that in late 1987
Chun personally gave 192.3 million dollars of secret political
fund collected from businessmen to Roh Tae-woo as the then ruling
Democratic Justice Party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who was arrested on December 3 last year, was indicted on
January 12 this year on charges that he raised about 900 million
dollars of secret fund while in office from 42 major business
leaders. Of that amount 270 million dollars was confirmed to be
from bribes.
</P>
<P>
Chun seized power on August 27, 1980, and ruled the nation
until February 1988. He was followed by Roh Tae-woo who stepped
down in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
Roh, who was taken into custody on November 16 last year after
being arrested, has stood trial three times already as he also
faces charges of receiving 370 million dollars in bribes from
businessmen while in office.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the graft charges, Both Chun and Roh are also
being tried for insurrection and treason for their leading roles
in the military mutiny on December 12, 1979 and the military
crackdown on the movement of May 18, 1980 in Kwangju, capital of
South Korea's South Cholla Province.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Increases Loans for China 'Lifeline' Water Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is to increase its
loans for a Chinese water project to 400 million US dollars, up
from China's application of 150 million US dollars two years ago,
a bank official has pledged.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Gunaratnam, principal irrigation engineer of the bank's
China/Mongolia Department, made the promise after an 18-day
inspection tour of the water conservancy project in north China's
Shanxi Province, the country's largest coal base.
</P>
<P>
The project will become effective in the bank's 1997 fiscal
year, just as scheduled, Gunaratnam said.
</P>
<P>
Since October 1994, the World Bank has dispatched five
delegations to inspect and evaluate the Shanxi project, designed
to divert water from the Yellow River, China's second largest, to
the northern Chinese province, which has chronically been plagued
by water shortages.
</P>
<P>
Gunaratnam's latest delegation included 15 specialists in
design, economics, accounting, settlement of the displaced,
environment evaluation, among others.
</P>
<P>
The latest inspection was the last by the World Bank before the
water project is officially appraised in September.
</P>
<P>
The water conservancy project is being built in Pianguan
County, in northwest Shanxi, and will divert Yellow River water to
the provincial capital of Taiyuan, Shuozhou and Datong, two
industrial cities in the north.
</P>
<P>
As it has a direct bearing on the lives of urban Shanxi
residents and the construction of local energy bases, the water
project has been dubbed a "lifeline for 30 million Shanxi people."
</P>
<P>
Gunaratnam quoted a 1982 World Bank survey of the water
resources of the Yellow River as saying that the greatest value
would be in the building of the diversion project in Shanxi,
rather than in other provinces which the river runs through.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zezhen, a Chinese water conservancy expert, said that the
Shanxi project is one of the few largest and technically most
complicated in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that the first phase of the project, to divert water to
Taiyuan, involves a tunnel of over 200 km, the world's longest of
its kind.
</P>
<P>
The second phase would lead Yellow River water to Shuozhou and
Datong. The pledged World Bank loans are for the first phase,
which is scheduled to completed in the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
A World Bank and Chinese expert group has put the cost of the
first phase at 11.3 billion yuan (about 1.35 billion US
dollars). Excluding the initial investment made since 1993,
another 895 million US dollars worth of capital is needed between
now and the end of the first phase. Of the total, 405.25 million
US dollars would be in overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Goldberg, another official of the World Bank's
China/Mongolia Department, said in a recent letter to Chinese
officials that the water project will significantly ease water
shortfalls in Taiyuan and thereby yield tremendous economic
benefits. It will also benefit other parts of China that rely
Taiyuan for the supply of electric power and coal.

<HEADLINE> Reform of Investment System Benefit Zhejiang Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Plans for a crucial railway line
in a Chinese province, first discussed over half a century ago,
are finally on a fast track to completion.
</P>
<P>
By widening the channels for investment east China's Zhejiang
Province's infrastructure projects have taken a leap forward.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of a Building-Operation-Transfer scheme has
led to work starting on a 251.5-km railway connecting Jinhua and
Wenzhou. It is the first local railway in the country using BOT as
a means of funding.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the railway had been under discussion for half
a century, but the scheme was shunted into the sidelines for lack
of money.
</P>
<P>
The railway is a joint investment by the province, the Ministry
of Railway and a Hong Kong company. The railway is expected to be
completed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the province has built or expanded a
number of power plants, completed 26 ports for 10,000 dwt ships
and opened six airports.
</P>
<P>
A modern multi-level transportation network with Hangzhou at
the center has taken shape.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Zhejiang's cities and counties just sat passively,
waiting for others to introduce investments, and this bottlenecked
economic development.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the province has spared no effort in the
reform of its investment system. After the reforms investments in
fixed assets in the province topped 130 billion yuan (about 15.7
billion US dollars) in 1995, 38 times more than that of 1990's
figure.
</P>
<P>
In highway construction, the province adopted a
"self-financing, self-management" method allowing developed areas
to raise money for road-building projects. The provincial
government also issued favorable policies to support them.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Peres Vow to Fight Threat to Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres today renewed their
commitment to advancing the peace process in the Middle East and
vowed to fight together against any threat to the peace and
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Israeli leaders were addressing an annual meeting
of the powerful U.S. pro-Israel lobby, the American israel Public
Affairs Committee (AIPAC), here tonight.
</P>
<P>
Calling Peres as "our full partner for peace," Clinton pledged
that the U.S.-Israel ties would remain "so strong and vital that
no one will ever drive a wedge" between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. President said that the radical Hezbollah and Hamas
would never succeed in their attempt to hinder the Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"We must restore peace, we must restore security, but we must
not be diverted from our ultimate goal (of a comprehensive Middle
East peace) else we will hand them the victory that they have
sought all along," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
In response, Peres said that he believed "peace will prevail
and terrorism will be defeated" in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"Before the curtain will fall on this century we will try to
establish a lasting and comprehensive peace in the entire Middle
East," Peres said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the stalled critical negotiations
between Israel and Syria would soon be resumed.
</P>
<P>
Peres flew in here early in the day for a three-day visit to
strengthen military and defense cooperation between the United
States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Peres, who is also Israeli Defense Minister, and U.S. Defense
Secretary William Perry signed in the afternoon a "joint statement
of intent" for cooperation to improve Israel's defense against
missile and rocket attacks.
</P>
<P>
After the speeches at the AIPAC meeting, Clinton and Peres met
for about 35 minutes at the White House, mainly discussing the
latest development in the Mideast peace process and defense
issues, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Peres' visit came just two days after the United States helped
arrange a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Wild Animals Live in Harmony With Mankind in Chinese Paradise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- It is no longer a dream in a
north China county for roe deers to live peacefully and in harmony
with hunters.
</P>
<P>
Wild red deers seek their mating partners in artificial deer
breeding farms and people, who carelessly wander into the shelter
of wild boars, can walk out safely.
</P>
<P>
Weichang County in north China's Hebei province has once again
become a "paradise" for wild animals, just as it was in the past.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the county now has 100 varieties of wild
animals, with the number of roe deers and wild boars alone each
exceeding over 20,000.
</P>
<P>
People often see groups of wild deers and wild boars running
around in forest areas. Even leopards, black bears, ibis and
swans, having disappeared for years, have started to build their
homes in the county.
</P>
<P>
Local governments devoted great efforts to tree-planting which
raised the county's total forest area to 400,000 hectares, 41.6
percent of the county's total area is covered with a blanket of
trees. This has provided a better living environment for animals.
</P>
<P>
Control on the hunting of wild animals, and an improvement
among local people on their sense of environmental protection, and
the protection of wild animals also contributed to the increase in
the number of wild animals.

<P>
HOHHOT, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Border trade between the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region and neighboring countries is booming.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistical report shows that the region's imports
and exports with Russia, Mongolia and East European countries
totalled 2.14 billion US dollars in 1995, accounting for 34
percent of the region's total foreign trade volume.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia resumed its border barter trade in 1983 with the
volume reaching 1.1 million US dollars in the same year.
</P>
<P>
It has trade relations with the Far East and Siberia, and many
places in Central Asia and East Europe, and has set up 193
enterprises in those countries.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the region had concluded 702 contracts
for construction projects and labor service with Russia.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it has exported 22 technological items valued at
16.69 million US dollars to Russia and Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
In return, a regional official said, the region has imported a
great amount of timber, chemical fertilizer and steel products,
which are in short supply in the region.

<HEADLINE> China's Ethnic Bamboo Houses Undergo Revolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Traditional bamboo houses of
China's Dai ethnic people are undergoing a building revolution, to
the surprise of many visitors.
</P>
<P>
For generations Dai families inhabited their bamboo homes, with
their collection of pigs and chickens raised on the ground floors
and people living and sleeping on the second floors.
</P>
<P>
A familiar creaking noise broke the silence when people went
upstairs to the living area.
</P>
<P>
Now the age of modern conveniences has arrived as people plug
in their electrical appliances. Separate bedrooms are being
introduced and the animals are kept in special pens.
</P>
<P>
In Jingmao Village of the Menglian Dai, Lagu, Wa Ethnic Groups
Autonomous County of Yunnan Province, all 23 Dai families have
built new houses with more expensive and solid timber instead of
bamboo.
</P>
<P>
Though retaining their traditional style, the wooden houses
have undergone a revolution of one kind and another inside.
</P>
<P>
The upstairs hall, which used to accommodate the kitchen and
the sitting room, are now furnished with modern furniture and
consumer electronic appliances. The kitchen cooker has been moved
to a separate section outside the hall. The balconies are filled
with flower pots.
</P>
<P>
The ground floor, where traditionally sundry goods were
scattered and pigs and chickens ran freely, has been made into
separate neat grain storage area and enclosed pens.
</P>
<P>
There is also a new stone wall around each of the buildings.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of new style Dai houses are now commonly seen in
south Yunnan", a local official said.
</P>
<P>
But the progress continues with locals saying the wooden
structures are actually not the best of the new Dai houses. Even
more modern homes are built of bricks - referred to as the "third
generation" of Dai houses.
</P>
<P>
One example is the Langle Village of the Menglian County, where
over 170 Dai families have built brick two-storey houses, even
advanced in style.
</P>
<P>
These houses not only have separate sitting rooms and kitchens,
but also separate bedrooms, compared with the tradition of one
family sleeping in one room.
</P>
<P>
There are also well-furnished modern kitchens to replace the
simple kitchen stoves.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM To Visit Tasmania After Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister John Howard today
said he planned to visit Tasmania later this week to meet
survivors of the Port Arthur massacre which left at least 33
people dead and another 19 injured Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to go to Tasmania later this week, probably on
Wednesday morning, to convey directly the concerns of the federal
government, my condolences, to visit some of the injured in
hospital," he told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
Howard described the shooting by the gunman as "Australia's
worst mass murder." It was "certainly the worst example, the
worst case of mass murder by an individual in Australian history
and perhaps in the history of the world over the last few
decades," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Howard, Attorney General Daryl Williams would call
an urgent meeting of federal, state and territory police ministers
to discuss tighter gun control laws. The meeting would address the
availability of semi-automatic rifles.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Commonwealth's powers to control
semi-automatics were limited to imports and these were banned in
1991. He said he understood that the weapon used in Port Arthur
was probably manufactured in Australia.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Fast Food Not Good For Children's Health, Expert Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Foreign fast foods, which are
becoming more and more popular in China, especially with the
young, who often eat them as regular meals, are simply not good
for children's health, according to a Chinese nutritionist.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xuecun, a member of the China Association of Nutritionists
and an expert specializing in Children's Nutritions, says as
quoted in China Youth Daily that the high content of calories,
fats, and proteins in these fast foods contribute directly to the
diseases of modern society, such as hypertension, diabetes, and
arteriosclerosis.
</P>
<P>
Chen has warned that the enthusiasm for foreign fast foods by
children in big cities will cause an imbalance of their nutrition
intake and threaten their future health.
</P>
<P>
He went on to point out that children are different from
adults, who are already accustomed to their Chinese diet and can
more easily give up some kind of food once they learn of its
harmful effects.
</P>
<P>
"Once a child gets a habit of eating fast food, it is very hard
to change it," he added.
</P>
<P>
"A scientific diet for children should include lots of cereal
grains, vegetables and fruits, adequate amount of milk and meat,
and as little sugar and fat as possible," the nutritionist
explained.
</P>
<P>
"But most foreign fast foods consist of lots of meat and little
vegetables, and the cereals in them are too refined to retain
Vitamin B, which is very helpful for the development of children's
memories," he regretted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that parents should be responsible for their
children's eating and drinking habits, and should not just give
them whatever they want. "It's OK to take your children out to buy
fast food once or twice, but never regularly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has 17 outlets of the US fast food giant
MacDonald's, which is planning to bring the number up to 30 by the
end of this year, as well as a number of Kentucky Fried Chickens
and Pizza Huts, the youth daily said.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey in three local primary schools showed that
almost 100 percent of the students interviewed know the name
MacDonald's, and some even eat at one of the outlets more than 10
times a month.

<HEADLINE> Anhui Construction Boom Pays Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The per capita living space of
urbanites in east China's Anhui Province has risen to 8.4 sq m,
higher than the nation average.
</P>
<P>
This is due to a construction boom in the past five years. The
province's total investment in residential housing amounted to 20
billion yuan in the period.
</P>
<P>
The province has built residential houses with a total floor
space of nearly 60 million sq m, providing new homes for 700,000
urban dwellers, a local construction official said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, local housing management departments have repaired
old and dangerous houses totalling five million sq m.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the local government has reformed the
decades-long practice of free allocation of public housing to
individuals by setting up a system under which funds for new
buildings were raised by the state, enterprises and individuals.
</P>
<P>
The system has so far been carried out in 78 cities and
counties.

HANGZHOU, April 29 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
attaches strategic importance to the use of loans from the World
Bank and other foreign capital, a senior provincial official has
said.
</P>
<P>
"To introduce more foreign capital, including the World Bank
loans, is of great significance to Zhejiang's economic
construction and social progress," Vice-governor Zhang Qimei said
at a recent ceremony for the signing of agreements to mark the
handover of World Bank loans to local cities and counties.
</P>
<P>
Zhang cited two provincial-level key projects funded by the
international financial body -- the Shanghai-Hangzhou Express Way
Project and the Inner River Redevelopment Project. The two
projects involve World Bank loans of 200 million US dollars and 40
million US dollars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The vice-governor urged local officials to make strong efforts
to ensure that the two projects are completed to a high quality.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang has implemented 30 World Bank-financed projects in the
past 13 years, with the value of loans totaling 1.79 billion US
dollars, according to official data.

percent of the domestic market as prices gradually decline.
</P>
<P>
Demand for small computers other than PCs will also increase in
the wake of the operation of an increasing number of key projects
in the fields of finance, insurance, foreign trade, power industry
and education. Production of work stations, servers and products
related to networks and data bases will also rise.
</P>
<P>
With computers entering more ordinary families, three or four
for every 100 households in major cities, the sales of software,
especially those on family education, household management and
teaching material, are expected to go up by 40 percent this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China is encouraging overseas
investment in the technical transformation of major state-owned
businesses, especially large and medium-sized enterprises, the
overseas edition of the "People's Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The country has 15,000 large and medium-sized state-owned
businesses, one third of which need to undergo technical
transformation, the paper quoted an official from the State
Economic and Trade Commission as saying.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 70-80 percent of the 260,000 approved
foreign-funded firms are Sino-foreign joint ventures built on
existing industrial firms.
</P>
<P>
Forming joint ventures with large state-owned firms has great
potential as these firms are usually on the top list of state
plans, possess large workshops, equipment and experienced workers,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
When key equipment is upgraded, the factories will show quick
results, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Large Stores Bring Shopping Convenience to Haikou Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The days when people in one
Chinese city had to travel by sea to do their daily shopping are
over.
</P>
<P>
The regular trips to the mainland for residents in the port
city of Haikou in the island province of Hainan are no longer
necessary.
</P>
<P>
Now they can buy their daily goods, as well as luxury items, in
shops and department stores that have sprung up in Haikou.
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, business was sluggish and most goods were in
short supply in Haikou. Even in the city's largest store, the
business space was only 1,000 sq m, making shopping inconvenient
for citizens.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, a number of retail sales stores have
opened in the city. Last November, a 4,000-sq-m luxury store was
set up opposite Haikou General Bus Station.
</P>
<P>
Following this, the 9,000-sq-m Hainan First Yong'an Department
Store and the 13,000-sq-m Shengsheng Department Store were opened.
</P>
<P>
These stores have a wide range of goods and a comfortable
shopping environment, and have also become the city's new sights.
</P>
<P>
But shoppers complain that the goods sold in the luxury stores
are high, saying that price tags has gone beyond their level.
</P>
<P>
But the money keeps flooding into the shop cash
boxes. Statistics indicate that the retail sales volume of
consumer goods in Haikou was about five billion yuan (about 601
million US dollars), against 550 million yuan in 1987.

WEIHAI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Weihai, a coastal city in Shandong
province, East China, has set a new record for production of sea
food.
</P>
<P>
Last year it bred and produced 880,000 tons of sea food - its

<HEADLINE> China Keeps Its Cool with Air-conditioner Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people wanting to keep
their cool during blazing hot summers have created a sky-high
demand for air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
Total market demand for air-conditioners in China is expected
to hit 5.3 million this year -- with sales going even higher if
the mercury levels soar.
</P>
<P>
The total market demand includes four million for Chinese urban
families and rural people, and the rest for institutions and
foreign trade, the "China Machinery and Electronics Daily" has
reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Light Industrial Information Center,
China turned out five million air-conditioners last year,
basically meeting domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
A survey jointly conducted by the State Planning Commission and
the State Information Center indicates that up to one million more
air conditioners will be needed this year if the temperature is
higher than expected this year.
</P>
<P>
But the country has an annual production capacity of ten
million units.
</P>
<P>
The hot-selling period for air-conditioners mainly spans
February to September, and the brisk markets are, as usual,
concentrated in prosperous and high-temperature areas such as
Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, the coastal areas in Zhejiang and
Jiangsu provinces, and a few southern China provinces and cities.
</P>
<P>
Analysts note that since the air-conditioner market is
consumer-oriented, all air-conditioner manufacturers, distributors
and related departments will attach greater importance to product
quality and the application of advanced technologies, which will
encourage fiercer competition this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Australia's swimmers are aiming
at winning 13 medals at this summer's Olympic Games in Atlanta,
head coach Don Talbot said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Talbot told The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper that the medals
would include at least one gold.
</P>
<P>
"We got nine medals in Barcelona four years ago and we've got
to try and improve 50 percent on that effort," Talbot said.
</P>
<P>
"I think, hopefully, with our gold medals, we will swim more
than one," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kieren Perkins won the only gold in the men's 1,500 meters
freestyle at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Despite the unimpressive results at last week's Olympic trials,
Talbot said he was sure that Australia's top swimmers, including
Perkins, could return to top form in the lead-up to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"The team cannot swim great all the time -- they have to have a
bad meet sometimes," he said. Now that we have got the bad water
behind us, let's get going for the next meet."

<HEADLINE> Mali, China to Further Bilateral Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAMAKO, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Though Mali is in Africa and China
in Asia, the two countries have been faring like next-door
neighbors for the past few decades.
</P>
<P>
State leaders and common folks alike have kept visiting each
other ever since October 1960 when Mali and China established
diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Several Mali presidents, prime ministers and parliament
speakers have visited China while the Chinese premier, several
vice-premiers as well as deputy parliament speakers have visited
Mali between now and then.
</P>
<P>
Mali is soon to roll out the red carpet for another state
leader from China.
</P>
<P>
This time it will be the country's president, Jiang Zemin, who
is scheduled to call in Mali in mid-May as one of the six stops he
will make during his visit to Africa.
</P>
<P>
The first visit by a Chinese president over the recent years
has been hailed here as "a significant event" in the Sino-Malian
relations.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations first developed in January 1964 when Zhou
Enlai, the then premier of China, visited Mali and made known to
the world China's approach toward the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The friendship between Mali and China has since weathered the
ups and downs stirred up by imperialists, colonialists and racists.
</P>
<P>
Mali has firmly supported China's policy that Taiwan is part of
China and shares the view with China that to strive to develop and
improve the living standards of people is one of the new contents
of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation between the two countries has enjoyed
smooth and fruitful development over the past 35 years and trade
volumes reached a record 61.43 million U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, China has not only provided Mali with 800
million yuan (some 100 million dollars) worth of assistance but
also dispatched technicians and doctors to work in the African
country, where, with what the technicians and doctors have built
and with their service, a monument of the Malian-Chinese
solidarity has been erected.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral cooperation has now spread to include industry,
construction and processing industries, animal husbandry and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the cooperation enjoys broad prospects of further
development just as Malian Prime Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita
has put it that the coming state visit by the Chinese president is
a significant event which will usher the tried and true bilateral
relations into a new era.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Enforce New Diesel Engine Emission Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGNKOK, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will enforce a new
emission standard on diesel-powered vehicles on January 1 next
year in a bid to reduce air pollution, particularly in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
According to the Pollution Control Department, all large
vehicles using diesel engines will be required in the new year to
meet "Euro I" emission standard, which specifies emission of
carbon monoxide at 4.5 grams per kilowatt-hour (gkwh), hydrocarbon
at 1.1 gkwh, nitrogen oxide at 8.0 gkwh, and particular matter at
0.36 gkwh.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles affected include trucks or vans with more than nine
seats, trucks with a combined weight of more than 3.5 tons, and
all new buses.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the new standard, originally scheduled for
early this year under a cabinet resolution, has been delayed for a
year because of tough negotiations between the government and
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the emission standard in force in Thailand allows
emission of carbon monoxide at 11.2 gkwh, hydrocarbon 2.4 gkwh,
nitrogen oxide at 2.4 gkwh, and particular matter 14.4 gkwh.
</P>
<P>
The exhaust emission from city buses, especially those using
diesel engines, is one of the key factors for Bangkok's foul air.

<HEADLINE> US Foundation Helps Drive Poverty from Chinese Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The US-based Ford Foundation has
pioneered an aid-the-poor drive in Mingzishan, a Chinese village
near the Sino-Vietnamese border.
</P>
<P>
Annual income of the villagers has risen from 204 yuan in 1990
to present 501 yuan, said Chi Zhonghua, an official working for
poverty elimination in the mountainous region in southwest China's
Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The village, inhibited by Hani ethnic group people, is one of
the four centers the American foundation has selected in Yunnan
for pilot tests.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the village had received 540,000 yuan
(about 65,000 US dollars) from the Ford Foundation, said Chi, who
works in an office especially set up by the province to co-operate
with the foundation, the largest in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The foundation has lent support to the village's development of
agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, tea, among others. In
co-operation with the foundation's projects, the provincial
government has granted more than 10 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chi said the foundation has played an pioneering role in
helping Mingzishan people shed poverty because its input has
attracted other domestic inputs.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six years, the village has established an
enterprise with an output value of 10 million yuan, and has built
roads, electricity and water supply facilities.
</P>
<P>
All four pilot centers have made satisfactory achievements
with the provincial government's support, Chi said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a group of personnel sent by the foundation are
visiting Mingzishan to explore a solution to problems of poverty
in Southeast Asian countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China has released an exquisite
album entitled "An Illustrated History of Chinese Civilization",
to popularize cultural knowledge and educate the younger
generation in national history, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting one of the world's oldest civilizations, with a
recorded history of nearly 4,000 years, Chinese culture is the
pride of both Chinese people and the whole of humankind.
</P>
<P>
A book for popular consumption, the album covers such important
subjects as history, literature, architecture, archaeology,
folklore and military science. Valuable photos of cultural relics
and portraits of famous historical figures are included.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the history of Chinese civilization, there have been
many great thinkers, scientists, inventors, politicians,
strategists, writers and artists. The album devotes many of its
pages to the best-known representatives of these fields.
</P>
<P>
With pride, the album introduces the academic establishment and
cultural wonders of ancient China, for example, the doctrines of
Confucianism, the Great Wall, the Dunhuang grottoes and Peking
Opera.
</P>
<P>
It also introduces ancient China's amazing success in science
and technology, including the "four major inventions" -- the
compass, paper-making, block-printing, and gunpowder.
</P>
<P>
The album focuses on the introduction of the dramatic changes
in China since 1949, particularly since 1979. China's most recent
historical period has brought a modernization drive, with

<HEADLINE> Clinton Testifies in Whitewater Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
gave more than four hours of videotaped testimony at the White
House on Sunday as a defense witness in the criminal trial of his
former Whitewater business partners.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors and defense lawyers questioned Clinton behind
closed doors throughout the afternoon. No details of his testimony
were revealed.
</P>
<P>
The White House has emphasized that Clinton is not a defendant
in the case and has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
"The president has consistently stated that he will provide the
court whatever information he can offer, and today's deposition
fulfills that promise," a White House statement said.
</P>
<P>
The taped deposition has been sealed by the court pending its
showing to the jury hearing the case in Little Rock, Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's testimony had been sought by defendants James and
Susan McDougal, Clinton's two partners in the Whitewater land deal
in the 1980s, to rebut claims by a key prosecution witness about
allegedly improper government-secured loans.
</P>
<P>
McDougal, his ex-wife, Susan, and Arkansas Governor Jim Guy
Tucker are charged with misusing nearly 3 million U.S. dollars in
government-backed loans in the mid-1980s. The trial is being
conducted in Little Rock, Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Former municipal judge David Hale, the prosecution's key
witness, alleged that Clinton, then Arkansas governor, was
involved in arranging an improper 300,000-dollar loan from Hale's
federally backed lending company to Mrs. McDougal in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has repeatedly dismissed Hale's allegations and called
them a "bunch of bull."
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr., who was presiding over
the proceedings from Little Rock via satellite, had ordered the
Clinton testimony sealed for at least 30 days.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Clinton said he did not object to making the tape
available to the public under certain conditions, "but it
shouldn't be abused in any way."

CANBERRA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The gunman responsible for the
worst shooting massacre in modern day Australia would appear
before a court later today or tomorrow, police said.

The man laid face down and motionless on a stretcher when he
was moved from an ambulance into the Royal Hobart Hospital at
10:30 a.m. local time (00:30 GMT), watched by a heavy police guard
and a silent crowd. The hospital also accommodates the victims of
his shooting spree.

Police said that the guest house was set on fire by the gunman
this morning. The house was "destroyed" by fire and ammunitions
were still going off in the fire, police said.

VIENNA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Canada drubbed the United States
5-1 in group A to snatch a quarter-final berth at the World Ice
Hockey Championship on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sweden and defending champion Finland drew 5-5 in a group B
match, while Russia and Czech Republic concluded their preliminary
round unbeaten.
</P>
<P>
Following a scoreless first period, the Canadians surged ahead
in the second as Paul Kariya, Kariya, Jeff Friesen and Yanic

<P>
Kariya then scored twice in the third period to set up his

<P>
In a rematch of last year's final, Sweden and Finland, two

fought to a draw in their last group match.
</P>
<P>
Sweden led the game early on Hans Jonsson's goal after only 30
seconds of play and the two sides traded goals later in the period
to give the Swedes a 2-1 edge.
</P>
<P>
But the second period saw Finland rallied to score three
unanswered goals, two of them from Mika Nieminen, and Sweden soon
tied the game.
</P>
<P>
Sweden regained the lead just six minutes from the end of the
game on a goal by Tomas Holmstrom but Juha Riihijarvi equalized
the score for Finland when he blasted a shot from the top of the
circle past Swedish netminder Thomas Oestlund.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the Czech Republic beat Italy 9-5 to become the group B
winner with four wins and a draw, while Russia scored an easy 6-0
victory over Austria to atop group A with straight wins.
