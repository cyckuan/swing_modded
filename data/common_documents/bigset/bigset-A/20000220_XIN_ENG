<HEADLINE> Israeli Official Denies Report on Dismantling of Jewish Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli official
Sunday denied a radio report that the Israeli army is preparing to
dismantle dozens of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza as
part of a final deal with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh dismissed the report aired
on the army radio as "a total fabrication."
</P>
<P>
The report, which quoted unnamed senior defense officials, said
the Israeli army is preparing to dismantle 21 settlements in the
first of a two-stage plan as part of a future permanent peace deal
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The report said 16 additional settlements, including all the 15
settlements in the Gaza Strip, will be evacuated in the second
stage.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the denial by Sneh, Justice Minister Yossi Beilin
told the army radio Sunday a final peace treaty with the
Palestinians will undoubtedly lead to the dismantling of all the
settlements in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
He said the settlements in Gaza are not historically justified
and are impractical, because Jews will always be a tiny minority
among a huge Palestinian majority.
</P>
<P>
The report on the dismantling of the settlements and Beilin's
remarks are regarded by analysts here as possible efforts by the
Israeli government to test public opinion on the uprooting of
Jewish settlements as part of a final peace treaty with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has said Israel will keep large blocs
of Jewish settlements under its sovereignty as a result of the
final peace treaty, thus hinting that small and isolated
settlements will be dismantled.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have rejected Barak's position, maintaining all
the 144 Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip must
be removed.

<HEADLINE> Former French President D'Estaing Says Mitterrand Is Collaborator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Former French President Valery
Giscard d'Estaing said on Sunday that his successor, Francois
Mitterrand, was an official of the Vichy collaboration regime
until 1943.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the television channel France 2, d'Estaing
said that the Socialists ``have never dared to say or write that
Mitterrand was a Vichy official until 1943.''
</P>
<P>
``It would be enough to go to the National Library to know it,
because he (Mitterrand) had written in the newspapers and he had
signed editorials for the Vichy regime until 1943,'' said d'
Estaing.
</P>
<P>
The former French president said that Mitterrand was offered a
job as ``delegate general for prisoners'' by the Vichy regime but
he refused to take it after being advised by a friend.
</P>
<P>
``I know the man who said to him (Mitterrand), `Don't do that,
it is ridiculous, you are mad.' (The battle of) Stalingrad had by
then taken place, the Americans had landed in north Africa, the
war was finished (by 1943),'' he said.

Igor Zlokozov, deputy chief of the Russian Labor Ministry's
employment department, told a Friday news conference here that the
official (government employee) unemployment rate plummeted 34
percent to 1.26 million people (1.7 percent of able- bodied
citizens) by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
More than 3 million people were given jobs by employment
services last year. The debt on unemployment allowances was cut by
68 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
This year the ministry plans to crate new jobs and to keep the
existing ones. No less than 1.5 million people will be offered
public works in agriculture, road construction and the like as
compared to 500,000 in 1999, said the official.

<HEADLINE> Cyanide Not Immediate Threat to Yugoslavian Health: UNEP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The levels of cyanide
concentration in the river Danube in Yugoslavia have not posed an
immediate threat to human health via drinking water supplies, the
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) said here Sunday
</P>
<P>
However, measurements indicate the levels of concentration
slightly above the recommended safe levels with regards to
toxicity for certain fish species near the Iron Gates 1 Dam
bordering Romania, the Nairobi-based UNEP said in a new release.
</P>
<P>
The scientists of the U.N. environment agency has recommended
to continue monitoring the pollution closely, the news release
said.
</P>
<P>
These scientists, members of a joint UNEP/Habitat (U.N. Cexer
for Human Settlements) Balkans Task Force (BTF) team that were
already working in Yugoslavia, took a series of water samples from
the Danube near Pancevo on February 15 down to the Iron Gates Dam
on February 19.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen samples were taken at different locations. At 17
locations, levels of cyanide concentration were within the safety
limit for drinking water but at one (Iron Gates 1 Dam), the limit
was slightly excessive.
</P>
<P>
However, there was evidence of cyanide that could be toxic for
certain fish species, according to the UNEP.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, as an emergency response to the cyanide
spill at the Baia-Mare gold mine in northwestern Romania, the U.N.
experts, together with one of their mobile laboratories, went to
Romania to help handling the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Court Starts Trial of Puppet Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 20 (Xinhua) -- A Kuwaiti criminal court on
Sunday began the trial of Al Aa Hussein, head of Kuwaiti interim
regime installed by Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait on August
2, 1990.
</P>
<P>
Al Aa Hussein told the court of what happened since the early
days of the Iraqi invasion and occupation, the Kuwait News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The hearing will continue on Monday for defense, Al Aa Hussein's
attorney Khalid Abdel Jalil was quoted as saying in a statement
after Sunday's trial.
</P>
<P>
Last week, there were unconfirmed reports that documents
concerning the trial had been stolen from the office of the public
prosecutor, arousing fears that the incident was likely to further
complicate the legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
Al Aa Hussein and his four children returned to Kuwait from
Norway early January. The Kuwaiti government described Hussein's
return as voluntary.
</P>
<P>
Al Aa Hussein, once a young lieutenant in the Kuwaiti army,
along with eight other men who worked in the former Ministry of
Defense, was said to be taken to Iraq just a few days after the
invasion.
</P>
<P>
It was announced later that they had formed the interim
(Kuwaiti) government, headed by Al Aa Hussein.
</P>
<P>
After the end of Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, the eight men were
released at the Kuwaiti border and each given 50,000 U.S. dollars
by Iraq. As they said on their return they were forced to cooperate
with the Iraqi regime, Kuwaiti legal authorities, which found their
claims genuine, acquitted them of any wrong-doing.
</P>
<P>
But Al Aa Hussein, who left Iraq for Norway about two years ago,
was given death sentence in absentia by a Kuwaiti court in 1991 on
charges of high treason.
</P>
<P>
The main objective he choose to return to Kuwait was, in his own
words, to appeal against the death sentence against him.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Iranian Foreign Ministers Discuss Bilateral Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan and his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi on
Sunday called on China and Iran, the two important developing
countries in Asia, to enhance cooperation in the new century.
</P>
<P>
In their first round of talks, Tang and Kharrazi exchanged views
on ways of promoting bilateral cooperation in political, economic,
trade and cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that with historical friendship, Iran and China
have made great contribution to the human civilization, and today
the two countries should further promote their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that no country should impose its own culture and
civilization on others, and a better world can only be achieved
through exchanges and dialog among different civilizations.
</P>
<P>
With such a motive, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami advocates
dialog among civilizations and the international community has
positively responded to this initiative, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang thanked Kharrazi's invitation extended to him and said that
his visit to Tehran was aimed at promoting understanding and
friendship between China and Iran and expanding bilateral
cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two great civilizations of China and Iran had
been linked through the "Silk Road" in ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Voicing Beijing's support for dialog among civilizations
proposed by President Khatami, Tang noted that the human
civilization would advance only when all world countries expand
their cooperation on the basis of mutual respect and equality and
promote mutual trust through improved understanding.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister said that China is ready to make
efforts in boosting cooperation with Iran in the new century and
maintaining durable stability in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Tang arrived here on Sunday morning for a four-day official
visit. Iran is the last leg of Tang's four-nation tour, which has
taken him to Mauritania, Tunisia and Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Backs Well-prepared Arab Summit: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's Foreign
Minister Saud Al-Faisal said Sunday his country backs a well-
prepared Arab summit aimed at tackling the latest Arab and regional
issues.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia will not hesitate in attending an Arab summit if it
is preceded by enough preparations, Faisal was quoted by the Saudi
Press Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on press reports speculating Riyadh has been
blocking a possible Arab summit to discuss the current development
on the Arab and international arenas.
</P>
<P>
Al-Faisal asserted Saudi Arabia has been always backing Arab
reunion, complaining "those talking about Riyadh's lack of desire
to hold the summit are ignoring the policy of the Kingdom."
</P>
<P>
The Saudi official said his country will attend Arab summits
which are prepared on the basis of Arab experiments and
experiences. But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Arab media recently called for holding an Arab summit in the
wake of Israel's air attacks on Lebanon's civilian installations.
</P>
<P>
The Arab world has strongly condemned the Israeli bombardments,
in which three power stations were destroyed and more than 20
people wounded.

<HEADLINE> Israel Cautiously Welcomes Election Results in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel Sunday expressed
cautious optimism over the preliminary result of Iran's
parliamentary elections that showed a landslide victory by
reformists, saying it might predict a series of changes.
</P>
<P>
"The interim result looked like a volcanic eruption of changes,"
Israel television quoted Prime Minister Ehud Barak as saying at a
weekly cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary result of the Friday poll in Iran showed that
reformist candidates close to Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
have secured an overwhelming lead in the competition for the 290
seats in Majlis, or Parliament.
</P>
<P>
But Barak cautioned against over-optimism, saying it is too
early to say if Tehran will change its anti-Israel policy.
</P>
<P>
"The first swallow does not necessarily mean the spring has
come," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Israel regards Iran as its arch-rival in the region, accusing
Tehran of supporting militant Islamic groups, including Hezbollah
guerrillas in southern Lebanon, for their anti-Israel activities.
</P>
<P>
It also views Iran's ability to improve its missile and nuclear
capability as a long-term threat facing the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Launch Second Industrial Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Despite an impasse in their
peace talks, Israeli and Palestinian officials Sunday launched a
new joint industrial zone project in the West Bank city of Jenin
with an aim of boosting economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Industry and Trade Minister Ran Cohen and his
Palestinian counterpart Sa'eid al-Krunz laid a cornerstone for the
industrial park, the second of its kind since the opening of the
Karni industrial park in Gaza in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
"This is a cornerstone toward a comprehensive peace between the
two peoples -- Palestinians and Israelis," Cohen said, adding the
industrial zone can create thousands of jobs for both sides and
thus serve as a stabilizing factor for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Echoing his Israeli counterpart, Krunz said the launching of the
industrial park is "an important step to build a just and
comprehensive peace in the area."
</P>
<P>
The joint venture was launched as the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks aimed at reaching a permanent peace reached an impasse over
disputes on an overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians blamed each other for the stalemate.
There are no signs of when the talks can be resumed.
</P>
<P>
"The negotiations are absent now, but both sides have to do
their best to reach an understanding," Cohen said at the launching
ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Belgians Protest Against Austrian Far-Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Almost 10,000 people staged
on Sunday a protest against Austria's incorporation of the far-
right Freedom Party into its coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The protest was held near the Austrian embassy in Brussels and
protesters demonstrated slogans that read "the democratic Europe
would not tolerate the fascism".
</P>
<P>
The protest drew participation from both Belgium's French- and
Flemish-speaking regions but observers here believed that those
from the French-speaking region of Wallon were more than those
from the Flemish-speaking region of Flanders.
</P>
<P>
Some schools in the Wallon region had called off organized ski
trips to Austria for their students as a form of protest against
the rise of the Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's demonstration has been the largest in scale in Belgium
that staged other protests ever since the beginning of this month.
</P>
<P>
Belgium has been a hard-line opponent against the Freedom Party
's joining the Austrian coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The country openly snubbed Austria at an informal European
council of social affairs ministers from the European Union member
states immediately after the Austrian coalition government swore
in on February 4.
</P>
<P>
Last week Freedom Party's chief Joerg Haider had to cancel a
trip to Brussels where he was to participate in a meeting by the
regions committee of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities warned that it would be improper for the
extreme rightist to come to Brussels in that they could not fend
off anti-Haider protests around the meeting place.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel warned earlier that the
incorporation of the far-right Freedom Party in the new Austrian
government would set a "serious precedent" as the extreme
rightists would cease to be something unusual in the political
scene in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Kyrgyzstan Holds Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Kyrgyzstan held its general
elections to the five- year-term parliament, comprised of the 45-
seat Assembly of People's Representatives and the 60-seat
Legislative Assembly, Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 545 candidates from nine parties and two political
blocks contested 105 seats of the parliament in 45 constituencies
across the country. Preliminary statistics show that over 50
percent of the 2,500,000 eligible voters took part in the polls,
the Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Kyrgyz Central Election
Commission (CEC) as saying late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the nation to hold parliamentary
elections on party lists. Today's poll was held in accordance with
a new election code, with the involvement of the political parties,
which have been allotted 15 of the 60 mandates in the Legislative
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The commission said 202 single-mandate candidates ran for the
Assembly of People's Deputies and 224 single-mandate candidates to
the Legislative Assembly.
</P>
<P>
To be elected in the first round, the single-mandate candidates
must win the support of over 50 percent of the registered voters
in their own constituencies. If not, the second round is likely to
be held on March 5.
</P>
<P>
The eleven political parties and election coalitions running
for parliament must collected at least 5 percent of the votes to
get through to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 observers from international organizations monitored
the election. And the elections have been registered valid, said a
CEC spokesman Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition parties do not participate in the elections
by
</P>
<P>
Casting ballot at his local polling station, Kyrgyz President
Askar Akayev said he hopes that the new parliament would be more
constructive and will contribute to the country's transition to a
new stage of reforms, believing that the current parliamentary
elections will provide one more illustration of irreversible
democratic reform.
</P>
<P>
On the creation of a parliamentary republic, he said he does
not support this idea as "in the transitional period the country
needs strong presidential authority." "But a balance between the
presidential and parliamentary branches must be attained," Akayev
said.
</P>
<P>
He thinks that the Communist Party, which is the strongest
political power in the country, has a good chance to join the top
three political organizations to emerge victorious from the
elections.
</P>
<P>
He said he would take a decision on whether or not to run for
president after the new parliament starts working.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Albright, Kono Hold Meeting on Trade, Other Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono on
Sunday made "extensive" and "very substantive" discussion on
bilateral relations, regional issues in Asia and the upcoming
global trade talks, the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley said their tow-hour
private meeting covered the "excellent bilateral relations"
between the two countries, regional issues involving such nations
as China, Indonesia and Myanmar, and the Group of Eight summit
that Japan will host on Okinawa in July.
</P>
<P>
Kono was taking a three-day visit to the United States. During
his stay here, Kono will also meet with President Bill Clinton and
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky.

<HEADLINE> Transport Operators to Raise Fares by 50% in Mozambican Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The owners of minibus taxis
said Saturday that they will raise their fares by 50 percent as
from March 1, the Mozambique News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The flat rate fare will thus rise from 2,000 to 3,000 meticais
(currently 13,761 meticais equal one U.S. dollar). The fare has
been 2,000 meticais since 1997.
</P>
<P>
Eugenio Filimone, Chairman of the Maputo Association of Road
Transporters, justified this on the grounds that the Maputo
Municipal Council has not replied to the association's earlier
proposals for fare alterations.
</P>
<P>
Next week, the association would meet with the Maputo Municipal
Council " to present our concern at this delay," the chairman
said.
</P>
<P>
But this meeting seems a mere formality. Filimone said that
regardless of anything said at the meeting, the fare increase
would go ahead on March 1.
</P>
<P>
If the authorities tried to resist the fare rise, there would
be a transport strike, he threatened.
</P>
<P>
"If the Municipal Council insists on maintaining the current
fare of 2, 000 meticais, then we shall just take our vehicles off
the roads", he said.
</P>
<P>
Filimone added that the proposed March fare increase did not
take account of the increase in fuel prices decreed by the
government on February 15. The price of diesel rose by 20
percent, from 4,340 to 5,210 meticais a liter.
</P>
<P>
The transporters justified the fare increase on the grounds
that their operational costs have risen. They mentioned fuel,
spare parts, and the impact of the Value Added Tax (VAT).
</P>
<P>
But the rate of inflation in Maputo has over the past three
years been less than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Filimone said that there would be another fare increase
later in the year -- the fare would rise from 3,000 to 3,500
meticais.
</P>
<P>
The capital Maputo has a population of almost one million
people. But there are less than 70 state-owned public buses.
</P>
<P>
The minibus taxis have been providing much of Maputo's
passenger transport.

<HEADLINE> Israel explains Lebanon policy to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's leading security adviser held a three-hour meeting Sunday
with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa to explain Israel's
policy in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The explanation carried out by Barak's security adviser Danny
Yatom and Israeli foreign minister's chief of staff Alon Pinkas
under the instruction of Barak and Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Barak's office said that Barak is
determined to exhaust every means in advancing talks on all tracks
with the objective of strengthening Israel's security by reaching
agreements.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak paid a brief visit
to Lebanon, expressing support for Lebanon on its resistance
against Israeli occupation in south Lebanon, where tensions have
grown recently after Israel and Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas
increased their attacks on each other.
</P>
<P>
Israel bombarded three Lebanese power plants, injuring 20
civilians in the raids, to retaliate Hezbollah's killing of seven
Israeli soldiers in the past month.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the only Arab state beside Jordan that signed a peace
treaty with Israel and it is also an active mediator in the Mideast
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel's security cabinet last week empowered Barak to order
immediate retaliation for deadly attack by the Hezbollah
guerrillas, who have been fighting to drive Israel out of the "
security zone" it has occupied since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Israel's attacks on civilian targets in Lebanon have unleashed a
storm of criticism among Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Syria's parliament on Friday described the raids as "Nazi
actions."
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Obeid told reporters on Sunday that
Egyptian technicians who have completed the inspection in Lebanon
could restore the power stations in one-and-a-half to two months.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Continue Fighting Terrorism: Interior Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Interior Minister
Saadettin Tantan has said Turkey will continue to struggle against
terrorism with determination.
</P>
<P>
Tantan made the remarks on Saturday at the end of a meeting on "
Internal Security and Anti-terrorism Struggle", which was held in
eastern province of Van.
</P>
<P>
"The struggle against the Kurdish Workers' Party(PKK), Hezbollah
and other terrorist groups has been successful and will continue
under discipline." the Anatolia News Agency Sunday quoted Tantan as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Tantan said a total of 1757 persons were taken into custody by
Saturday in 54 provinces in a nationwide crackdown on Hezbollah,
the radical Islamic terrorist group in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
So far, a total of 59 dead bodies were unearthed while a large
amount of weapons, including rifles, cartridges, hand grenades,
dynamites, explosives, rocket launchers, mortars and landmines,
were seized, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish security forces started massive raids against Hezbollah
in Beykoz district of Istanbul on January 17, in which Huseyin
Velioglu, the head of Hezbollah, was killed.
</P>
<P>
So far the security forces have launched 780 operations against
Hebollah.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah was found to have committed a total of 997
kidnappings, murders and blackmail between 1991 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
The radical group began its operations in the late 1980s and
used to target mainly PKK, which has been fighting since 1984 for
an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, and other
sympathizers of Kurds.
</P>
<P>
It has reportedly sought to turn secular but overwhelmingly
Muslim Turkey into a strict Islamic-ruled regime by means of
violence and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Hezbollah is thought to have no connections with the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon, which was leading a guerrilla
war against Israeli occupation troops in south Lebanon.

MAPUTO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Cooperation in southern Africa
is a priority in the construction and promotion of the peace and
stability in the region, Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi
said.
</P>
<P>
Peace and stability are necessary for sustainable economic and
social development which is the goal the region has been pursuing

efforts currently under way to reach peaceful solutions to these
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the emergence of regional organizations such as

<HEADLINE> Turkish Police Detain Kurdish Mayors in Southeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Three kurdish mayors have taken
into custody in Turkish southeastern provinces on charge of
colluding with the outlawed separatist Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK), the Anatolia News Agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Emergency Rule Regional Governorship (OHAL), in charge of
security and stability affairs in Turkey's unrest Kurds-intensive
southeast, said that they detained Feridun Celik, mayor of Turkey's
biggest Kurdish city Diyarbakir, Feyzullah Karaaslan, Bingol Mayor
and Selim Ozalp, Siirt Mayor on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The three mayors are from the People's Democratic Party (HADEP),
a legal party in Turkey which comprises some Kurdish intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
The OHAL said that they have received information that these
mayors had carried out actions in coordination with the PKK, which
has been fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish state in
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The detentions were made as a result of the interrogation of
people who were captured in recent operations against the PKK in
Diyarbakir and its surrounding provinces.
</P>
<P>
The OHAL said that "we realized that PKK had coordination with
some mayors from HADEP. They gave secret support for PKK, attended
meetings of the terrorist group, got instruction from PKK and
transferred some of their financial sources to PKK."
</P>
<P>
The OHAL added that the legal procedures regarding the three
mayors will continue.
</P>
<P>
HADEP's Diyarbakir Provincial Branch condemned the detentions on
Saturday, saying the actions "can damage the peace wind which is
blowing in the region for a long time." The branch requested that
the mayors be released.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Question Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police questioned
former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Sunday over a case in
which he was suspected of bribery and breach of trust, Israel Radio
said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was greeted by his supporters outside the headquarters
of the National Fraud Police in Bat Yam, south of Tel Aviv, before
entering the premises and receiving questioning, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The report said this might be the last time Netanyahu was
interrogated by police before the case was transferred to the state
attorney, who would decide whether to indict the former right-wing
leader.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported last week that the police would conclude
the investigation with a recommendation to prosecute Netanyahu
because they believed there was enough evidence to press charges
against him.
</P>
<P>
Since last October, Netanyahu and his wife Sara had been
interrogated after a contractor presented the government with a
104,000-U.S.-dollar bill for a string of private house service he
carried out for the couple in Netanyahu's three years in office
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
The police have also found that after leaving office in May last
year, Netanyahu had kept boxes of valuable gifts he received while
he was in office. These gifts should have been returned to the
state after he left office.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing, calling the investigation
politically motivated.

<HEADLINE> Barak Defies International Criticism of His Lebanon Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Sunday denounced criticisms leveled by Arab countries in the
past days against Israel's raids on Lebanese civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the weekly cabinet meeting, Barak warned that the "
incitement" campaign will only do harm to the recently stalled
Middle East peace process, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy also said Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak's backing of Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas
is "worrisome".
</P>
<P>
Levy told Israel Radio that Mubarak's remarks are not alone
amid "a wave of hatred" across the Arab world against Israel,
pointing out that Syrian statements have equated Israeli attacks on
Lebanon as Nazi acts.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made a surprise four-hour visit to Lebanon on Saturday,
the first of its kind by an Egyptian head of state since 1952, in
order to demonstrate Egypt's support of Lebanon in the face of
Israeli bombing threats to Lebanese infrastructure sites and
civilian villages.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said in a joint statement after meeting with Lebanese
President Emile Lahoud that the justified resistance of Lebanese
was only a result, not a cause of Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israel unilaterally set up a buffer zone in South Lebanon in
1985 with a self-declared purpose of protecting its northern border
areas from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanese Shiite Muslim militant group Hezbollah, or
Party of God, has been fighting against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
In the past weeks, Hezbollah escalated its activities in the
region and killed seven Israeli soldiers and a senior commander of
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
In revenge, Israeli troops struck at three Lebanese power
stations supplying electricity to Beirut and other Lebanese cities,
killing at least a dozen civilians and leading to a total damage
cost of 200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz
submitted a policy-changing plan to last week's session of Israeli
security cabinet, asking for approval to fire back Hezbollah
guerrillas hidden in villages, which will surely cause great
civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli inner-circle security cabinet authorized a three-
minister team headed by Barak to decide on short notice to approve
IDF attacks on suspected Hezbollah targets inside Lebanese
villages.
</P>
<P>
This decision invited severe criticisms from Arab countries and
even the United States, the major patron of Israel in the world
politics arena.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Jordan's King Abdullah also decided
last week to cancel a planned visit to Israel in protest against
Israeli attacks and statements.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Children Call for More Media Coverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- A group of Nigerians kids
appealed here on Sunday to the country's editors and journalists
to write more for them.
</P>
<P>
Why did the journalists think the topic of legislators'
furniture allowance was more important than some of the urgent
issues on children, said 16 year-old Ikenna Alumona at a meeting
organized by the guild of Nigerian editors.
</P>
<P>
He and other children attending the occasion said that the
media should not just stop at leaving a page to the children, as
some newspapers do, but write on them.
</P>
<P>
The children also put the editors to task on issues like
cultism in the society, ethnic killings and race discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was organized in collaboration with the United
Nations resident mission to develop a media agenda for reporting
on children's issues.

<HEADLINE> 10,000 Affected with Malaria Yearly in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Almost 10,000 people in
Nepal are infected with malaria yearly, out of which 1,000 die
from the disease, according to the experts who gathered here
Saturday for a malaria control program.
</P>
<P>
While 40 percent of the global population is at constant risk
of getting infected with malaria, 16.4 million people out of a
population of 22 million in Nepal is at the risk, said Dr.
Mahendra Bahadur Bista, director of Epidemiology and Disease
Control Division of the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
The experts attending the seminar said that drug resistance,
population movement, deteriorating sanitary condition and climatic
changes are contributing to the spread of malaria, which was
almost under control in the 1970's.
</P>
<P>
Bista said a campaign has been launched to reduce the malaria
cases by 50 percent by 2010, and another 50 percent within the
next five years and the malaria control program is now in
operation in 64 of the 75 districts in the country.

<P>
LONDON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United defeated
their nearest premier league rivals Leeds United 1-0 without David
Beckham on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
One goal from Andy Cole sealed the win for the European
champions.
</P>
<P>
Beckham was dropped from the Manchester United side for the
game after reports of a training ground bust-up with manager Alex
Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
Beckham's teammates coped admirably without him to push United
six points clear in the title race.
</P>
<P>
United, who lost Dwight Yorke to injury in the 29th minute,
also hit the upright after Roy Keane's shot came off goalkeeper
Nigel Martyn's arm.
</P>
<P>
Leeds wasted several chances to equalise. Erik Bakke's 59th
minute header hit the crossbar and Lee Bowyer somehow contrived to
send a follow-up shot over the bar after Alan Smith had crashed
the ball against a post with nine minutes left.

<HEADLINE> Premier Calls for More Efficient Customs Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
today urged Customs officials at all levels to do a better job
this year.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who is also a Standing Committee member of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
noted that continuous and intensified efforts should be made to
end smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Customs officials should always be prepared for anti-smuggling
efforts, and do all in their power to stop smuggling, Zhu said at
a national meeting of Customs officials.
</P>
<P>
Zhu urged Customs officials to collect taxes in a legal manner
and fulfill the taxation goal for this year.
</P>
<P>
He also called for efforts to deepen reforms and strengthen the
building of a modern Customs system.
</P>
<P>
The fact that some Customs officials involved in statutory or
disciplinary violations were turned over to the judiciary for
punishment shows that the Party and the government have the
determination, ability, and means to wipe out corruption, the
premier said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu affirmed the achievements of Customs work last year, and
said anti-smuggling efforts and the increase of taxes contributed
to increased domestic demand and active fiscal policies, and
created a sound market environment for state-owned enterprises.

GUANGZHOU, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian today urged soldiers of the People's Liberation Army (PLA)
to pursue higher standards and build the army into one of the
world's first-class armies.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the

country, two systems" policy of the central government.
</P>
<P>
Chi also visited the Zhuhai base of the PLA's Macao troops this
morning.
</P>
<P>
"History will remember the contributions made by the PLA
soliders in Hong Kong and Macao," he said.

<HEADLINE> 83,000 Chinese Die in Traffic Accidents in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Traffic accidents claimed the
lives of more than 83,000 Chinese, injured over 280,000, and
caused direct economic losses of 2.1 billion yuan last year, a
rise of seven percent, 28 percent, and 10.1 percent respectively
over 1998.
</P>
<P>
"However, the death rate per 10,000 vehicles shrank to 15.5,
down from 17.3 in 1998, " Meng Hongwei, director of the Traffic
Management Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security, said here
today.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the drivers of motor vehicles are
responsible for 85 percent of all the traffic accidents, 74
percent of all the traffic deaths, 82 percent of all the traffic
injuries, and 92 percent of the economic losses.
</P>
<P>
New drivers with less than three years of driving experience
are believed to be most prone to causing traffic accidents,
accounting for about 50 percent of all the traffic indexes.
</P>
<P>
Speeding, negligence, failure to adjust to unexpected traffic
situations, failure to give pedestrians the right-of-way, and
driving in the wrong lanes are regarded as the five major causes
of traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, last year saw a rise in the number of highway
accidents, the number of drivers who flee the scene after causing
accidents, and a decline in the number of accidents resulting in
multiple deaths.
</P>
<P>
The director said that China will face a difficult traffic
situation in the near future as the country embraces another
economic boom, while the management skills of its traffic
departments are not keeping pace with economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Barak's Top Security Adviser in Cairo for Talks on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's top security adviser, Danny Yatom, arrived in Cairo on
Sunday for talks aimed at easing Egypt's anger over recent Israeli
air raids on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Yatom, leading a delegation of Israeli foreign ministry
officials, will meet Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa during
the several-hour-long visit, said an Israeli embassy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The visit came one day after Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
paid a previously unannounced visit to Lebanon on Saturday in
support of the country which is under threat of further Israeli
attacks against civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Israeli army bombed three power stations and
injured 15 Lebanese civilians in retaliation for the Iranian-backed
guerrilla group Hezbollah's killing of Israeli soldiers in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been spearheading a war against
Israeli occupation troops since Israel set up a security zone in
south Lebanon in 1985 with a self-claimed aim to protect its
northern territories from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has stepped up its attacks on the Israeli troops and
the Israel-allied South Lebanon Army since the breakup of the
Syrian-Israeli peace talks in January.
</P>
<P>
The escalating tensions in south Lebanon have drawn strong
condemnations on Israel from Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli troops on Sunday shelled with heavy artillery
fire on Hezbollah outposts inside the security zone, but no
casualties reported so far, said Lebanese security sources.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Hezbollah earlier in the day said the
Hezbollah guerrillas fired back by launching rockets.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Labor Group Demands Share in Oil Price Leap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's largest trade union,
the National Labor Congress (NLC), has called for a share in the
windfall accruing from recent oil price leap.
</P>
<P>
The Punch, a popular Nigerian newspaper, Sunday quoted John
Odah, acting general secretary of the NLC, as saying here on
Saturday that the rise of crude oil price on the world market
would strength the NLC's position for an enhanced new minimum
wage.
</P>
<P>
The oil price has risen from around 18 U.S. dollars per barrel
last year to last week's all-time high of 30, due to the
production cut-back by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
The unusually cold weather in some parts of the world driving
heating oil demand up also contributes to the price leap.
</P>
<P>
"The marked increase would render untenable argument of
government's inability to pay," said Odah.
</P>
<P>
People from different walks of life in the oil producing west
African nation have been clamoring recently for the judicious use
of the extra money.
</P>
<P>
"We have had a windfall in the past but the money was
squandered," said Doyin Okupe, President Olusegun Obasanjo's media
assistant.
</P>
<P>
However, quite contrary to the views of most Nigerians, it
would take some 120 to 280 days before the actual sum of the
windfall could rest in the government's pocket, he said.

<HEADLINE> Editorial on County-Level Education (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County and city-level Party and government officials are
responsible for implementing the Party's line and policies in
grassroots units in urban and rural areas. Therefore, the
ideological and political qualities of officials at this level
will directly affect the implementation of the Party's line and
policies, influence the reform, development and stability of the
localities, and eventually affect the relations between the Party
and the broad masses of the people, as well as between officials
and the people they govern, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stresses the necessity of making a success the "
three emphases" on education campaign, saying that quite a number
of local officials lack a systematic knowledge of Marxism, or are
deficient in capacity to deal with complicated situations and
finding solutions to complicated contradictions, though an
overwhelming majority of the officials at this level are
politically trustworthy, work hard, and are making progress.
</P>
<P>
"Some too readily overestimate themselves, lack self-discipline,
or have serious problems in the Party's spirit and work style," it
says.
</P>
<P>
To make a success of the second phase of the campaign, the
editorial states, it is necessary to make political awareness the
focus of the campaign to achieve five specific objectives through
certain periods of full-time theoretical study, criticism and self-
criticism, advocating democracy, and following the mass line in
the manner of inviting ordinary people to air complaints, and
making corrections.
</P>
<P>
The five objectives are a firm belief in Marxism, construction
of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the eventual
realization of communism; firm and thorough implementation of the
Party line and policies and the major decisions of the central
government; firm thinking to serve the people wholeheartedly;
strict observance of all rules of democratic centralism; and a
fine work style featuring seeking truth from facts while being
pragmatic and accomplishing objectives by relying on the wisdom of
the broad masses of the people.

<HEADLINE> Editorial on County-Level Education (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, China's
leading national newspaper, will publish an editorial tomorrow
urging county-level Party and government officials to carry out
the "three emphases" on education in a thorough and practical
manner.
</P>
<P>
The "three emphases" on education are theoretical studies,
political awareness and good conduct. The campaign is designed to
intensify the building of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in
the new era and improving the capacity of the Party's leadership
and its governing capability.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the campaign was carried out last year among
officials above the county and city levels, including officials
from central Party and governmental organizations and ministerial
and prefecturial officials, and satisfying results were reportedly
achieved.
</P>
<P>
The second phase is now being carried out among officials at
county and city levels.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that the CPC Central Committee with Jiang
Zemin at the core is paying great attention to the second phase
and is especially concerned with improving ideological and
political qualities among county and city officials.
</P>
<P>
It urges leading officials of the CPC committees at all levels
to make a careful study and thoroughly understand the guidelines
of the central government on carrying out the "three emphases" on
education and make a success of the second phase according to the
requirements of the central government.
</P>
<P>
The editorial calls the campaign an inventive and important
move in stepping up and improving Party construction, especially
the building of leadership teams, as well as improving the
ideological and political awareness of officials in the new period.
</P>
<P>
"Carrying out the 'three emphases' on education among county-
and city-level officials is an important segment of the entire
campaign, and the successful experience of the first phase should
be learned from," the editorial states.

<P>
NEW DELHI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- India Sunday rejected
Pakistan's offer for resuming the Lahore peace process and said
that the only agenda for talks on Kashmir would be the return of
the Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) to India.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an election rally in Panipat of north India's
Haryana state, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said, "
Pakistan says Kashmir is the main issue. We say talks with
Pakistan can take place only when Pakistan vacates PoK as the
people of Jammu and Kashmir have always been with India."
</P>
<P>
His remarks came out a day after Pakistan Foreign Affairs
Minister Abdul Sattar's offer for resuming the Lahore peace
process with India.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said that it was Pakistan which has dashed the hand of
friendship, when exactly this day a year ago the Lahore bus
journey was undertaken.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The global computer
manufacturing giant Compaq has recently opened "Compaq West
Africa" office in Lagos to further explore the promising market on
the African continent, said a source here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Compaq computers first entered the west Africa market directly
in 1999 by establishing a local representative reporting to the
east and west African headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, and
appointing selected local resellers, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Henry Ferreira, director of Compaq West Africa, said Compaq
recorded about 45 percent market share in Africa in last year's
performance of the industry.
</P>
<P>
"In response to the strong demand for its products, Compaq has
to date authorized 15 resellers in Nigeria and one reseller in
Ghana," said Ferreira.
</P>
<P>
According to Ferreira, Compaq's success could be attributed to
the corporation's continuing commitment to service and support,
its strong partnership with authorized resellers and its local
implementation of exclusive three-year warranty.

<HEADLINE> Beckham Axed for Crunch Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- David Beckham has been axed
from the Manchester United side for their crunch Premiership clash
with Leeds United after reports of a training ground bust-up with
Alex Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
Beckham arrived at Elland Road with the United team but has not
been named in the team for the top-of-the-table clash. Nick Butt
has taken his position.
</P>
<P>
When asked why Beckham was not playing, Ferguson refused to
comment.
</P>
<P>
Newspaper reports claim Beckham was ordered to leave training
yesterday following an apparently heated argument with the United
manager. The alleged bust-up is bound to add fuel to the rumours
that Beckham will leave Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson is said to have blown his top after Beckham went
missing on Friday, the day that he was expected to return to
Manchester having spent Thursday in his Hertfordshire mansion.
</P>
<P>
Becks stormed off the training ground after Ferguson attack and
was seen driving home 20 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Alex Ferguson is believed to be unhappy with the 24-year-old
high profile life and he has regularly been linked with a big
money move away from Old Trafford with Arsenal and Barcelona the
likely destinations.

<HEADLINE> Manila Holds High Hopes for Success of Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Sunday that it holds high hopes for the success of its peace talks
with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), which will resume
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, National Security Adviser Alexander
Aguirre said that the government will do its part to meet
President Joseph Estrada's deadline to reach a peace agreement
with the MILF before the end of June this year.
</P>
<P>
"This is our main objective. We want to persuade them to stop
fighting and accept autonomy. This way, we will have a united
nation and we can speed up Mindanao's development," Aguirre said.
</P>
<P>
But he also made it clear that if "worse comes to worst" and
the MILF insists on gaining independence, the government is ready
to assert its authority to protect the country's integrity.
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) is ready to fulfill
the president's order to protect the nation's territorial
integrity and sovereignty, he said.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said that while the MILF may be 15,000-strong, it does
not represent the Muslim community in the Philippines, which has
some 5 million to 10 million members.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF will resume peace negotiations
Monday, despite clashes between their respective troops in
Mindanao in the past week. About 90 people from both sides were
killed and dozens of others wounded in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said both sides cannot afford to drag the peace process
as the people of Mindanao are suffering from poverty.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has been fighting for an independent state in Mindanao
in the past two decades.

<HEADLINE> 11 Rebels Killed in Fighting in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Eleven Tamil Tiger rebels had
been killed in fresh fighting in northern Sri Lanka, the Defense
Ministry said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A ministry statement said all the casualties were inflicted on
rebels in the northernmost Jaffna peninsula, the former stronghold
of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
Government troops on Saturday engaged a group of rebels with
small arms and machine guns in general area Vathirayan, killing
four rebels, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Two more LTTE rebels were killed in the same area, it said.
</P>
<P>
Government troops sniped and killed two LTTE rebels at
Thanankilappu.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that government troops killed three more
rebels at Vatharavathi, Kopai and Muhavil respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sri Lanka's army chief Lt. Gen. Srilal Weerasooriya
told the Sunday Times that the LTTE was trying to regain Jaffna
since they lost it in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"They need Jaffna where their quasi-regime was earlier based.
We can see the concentration of their cadres in the Wanni and the
North and a reduction in Batticaloa (in eastern Sri Lanka) since
1997," Weerasooriya said in an interview with the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Following their victory in the northern Wanni region in early
November last year, the LTTE rebels have tried to get a foothold
into Jaffna but with little successes.
</P>
<P>
Weerasooriya said the LTTE has lost well over 1,000 men since
last November, suffering one of their worst defeats in the fight
for an independent Tamil homeland in Sri Lanka's north and east
since 1983.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAU, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore scored a lone goal in
the final minutes to beat Brunei 1-0 here on Sunday in the final
round of the Group 10 Asian Cup qualifer.
</P>
<P>
In the 88th minute, Mohamed Noor Ali eventually converted the
advantages into reality after the Singaporeans squandered a series
of chances in the first half.
</P>
<P>
However, Singapore still remains one step away from entering
the finals of the Asian Cup as it finished with two wins and one
defeat in the four-team group that also included Japan and Macau.
</P>
<P>
Japan, who had two straight wins, is virtually certain to
advance to the finals in Lebanon in October as it only needs a
draw against Macau in the match later to finish atop the group.
</P>
<P>
Japan, winner of the 1992 Asian Cup, has scored 12 goals so far
without conceding any.
</P>
<P>
Macau beat Brunei 1-0 in the opening round for its sole victory
while Brunei lost all three matches.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Sources in the Israeli Prime Minister's office Saturday
welcomed the election results in Iran, but stressed that only time
will tell if real changes are underway in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, reports said that in Iran's small towns and big cities,
reformists offering wider freedom under an Islamic system defeated
hard-liners in more than half the seats for which results were
determined Saturday in parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
If the trend continues, which appears likely, reformists will
eclipse years of conservative control and oust hard-liners from the
290-seat parliament for the first time since the 1979 revolution
put clerics in charge of the country.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad is planning to reshuffle his
government, Lebanese television reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian government, made up of 22 ministers and three deputy
prime ministers, has been headed by Prime Minister Mahmoud Zouebi
for the last 13 years and no changes have been made for the last
eight years.
</P>
<P>
Although the extent of Assad's planned reorganization is not yet
clear, it seems that changes will be made in order to introduce
Assad's son Bashar into the government.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt will support Lebanon against Israeli threats to bomb
civilian targets, President Hosni Mubarak said during a historic
visit to Beirut Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued after their talks, Mubarak and
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud said they support the right of
Lebanese guerrillas to fight the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's four-hour visit was the first by an Egyptian head of
state to Lebanon since Egypt became a republic in 1952 and appeared
to be in response to Lebanese media criticism that Egypt has not
been vocal enough in condemning Israeli air strikes last week that
destroyed three Lebanese power stations.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Some 150,000 people Saturday thronged Austria's Heldenplatz
square, where Adolf Hitler once addressed the masses, to express
their horror at the new national government of Joerg Haider's far-
right Freedom Party and the conservative People's Party.
</P>
<P>
Haider has been the focus of protests because of his past praise
of Hitler's employment policies and his description of Nazi SS
veterans as men of good character.

<HEADLINE> Initial Results: Reformists Pose to Win in Iranian Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 20 (Xinhua) -- As vote counting from Friday's
parliamentary elections is still underway, reformers in Iran are
posed to gain dominance in the future parliament, according to
initial results.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 160 new parliamentarian elects are reformers, which
suggests a victory of the pro-reform coalition, the Tehran Times
daily said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In Tehran, Mohammed Reza Khatami, the younger brother of
reformist President Mohammed Khatami, has so far won the largest
number of votes, while Ali Reza Nouri, the brother of jailed
reformist Abdollah Nouri, ranks the second.
</P>
<P>
Abdollah Nouri, a close ally of Khatami, was sentenced to five
years in prison last November on charges ranging from publishing
anti-religious materials and sacrilegious articles to insulting the
late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry has announced that over 80 percent, or 30
million of Iran's eligible voters cast their votes in the 6th
Majlis elections, in which about 5,700 candidates of different
political backgrounds contend for 290 seats.
</P>
<P>
Most Iranians hope that the reformist camp, which groups about
18 parties, will win the majority in the new Majlis to help push
forward President Khatami's programs of political and cultural
opening, which has so far been hindered by the powerful
conservatives.

<HEADLINE> "Big Program" to Undermine His Authority: Wahid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid said there had been a "big program" to undermine
his authority, such as rumors every day about an impending cabinet
reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said reports on an impending cabinet reshuffle and other
such unfounded news reports were totally untrue and launched only
to undermine his authority as president.
</P>
<P>
"I've reiterated there will be no cabinet reshuffle. They are
part of a big program to destroy the dignity of the president," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a get-together with leaders of the socio-religious
organization Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), East Java's branch, and Muslim
scholars in Surabaya, capital of East Java on Saturday night,
Wahid said the rumors of a cabinet reshuffle were from "people's
imagination."
</P>
<P>
Wahid said Coordinating Minister for the Economy, Finance and
Industry Kwik Kian Gie was asked to step down on Friday only
because he ran a sauna center in the past, while Foreign Minister
Alwi Shihab called him on the phone saying his wife was disturbed
by a cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
"That's not because he (Alwi) was afraid of losing his job, but
because he was confused," the president said, adding that recent
protests demanding the resignation of Kwik Kian Gie were also part
of the plan to undermine him.
</P>
<P>
Wahid acknowledged that some people might be working against
him.
</P>
<P>
"If they stage a protest against me, then I will ask... who
paid you?" he was quoted by Antara News Agency Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wahid has repeatedly said there was no plan to reshuffle his
four-month-old cabinet after suspending former armed forces chief
General Wiranto from his ministerial post on February 13.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto has been suspended from the cabinet pending an official
investigation after an inquiry implicated him and other generals
in the bloodshed that swept East Timor last year.

<HEADLINE> Russia Begins to Withdraw Troops From Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia began to pull its combat
troops out of the breakaway republic of Chechnya on Sunday, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The tank battalions of the 131st independent motorized brigade,
which participated in combat operations in Chechnya, became the
first military unit withdrawn from the republic.
</P>
<P>
Tankmen together with their combat vehicles rolled away on
Sunday from the Khankala railway station, situated in a Grozny
suburb, to the city of Maikop, the place of the brigade's
permanent deployment, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
This tank unit arrived in the North Caucasus on September 12
as part of the Eastern Army Group of Russian federal forces in the
region, and took part in the fighting for capturing the city of
Argun and the town of Vedeno, deputy commander of the 47th Army
Corps Nikolai Kalabukhov was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russia launched its anti-terrorist military campaign last
September after the Chechen rebels' incursion into neighboring
Republic of Daghestan and several apartment explosions in Moscow
and other two Russian cities, which killed over 300 persons.
</P>
<P>
 After a five-month bloody fighting Russia liberated over two
thirds of the breakaway republic's territory and nearly all its
population, drove the remaining militants into the south mountains.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week the Russian military authorities announced it
was ending the final phase of the military operation in Chechnya
and will withdraw its troops very soon.

ISLAMABAD, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Sunday ordered the

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Pledges Efficient Handling of Rwandan Cargoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has pledged to
assist Rwanda in ensuring that cargo consignment destined for the
land-locked country is cleared without undue delays, local media
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian Minister for Communications and Transport Ernest
Nyanda told a visiting Rwandese business delegation on Friday that
a number of clearing and forwarding agents were active at several
Tanzanian ports to make sure that cargo destined for the tiny
central African country was moved at required pace and speed.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, a transport coordinating committee
has been formed to address issues that would likely hamper smooth
transportation along the central trade corridor running through
Tanzania to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania will make all necessary provisions to ensure
its routes to be the cheapest, most efficient and most convenient
to Rwanda businessmen.
</P>
<P>
As peace and stability return to Rwanda, business activity has
picked up, leading to increased international trade. Both Kenyan
and Tanzanian ports authorities have shown increasing interests in
the potential cargo market in this landlocked country.
</P>
<P>
However, Rwandan imports and exports through the Kenyan port of
Mombasa have to transit through Uganda on their way to and from
the port, while the central corridor in Tanzania leads the Rwandan
capital Kigali directly to the port of Dar es Salaam.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Henry Cherono of Kenya won
the men's title with a time of two hours 21 minutes nine seconds
in the Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon 2000 here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard to win the title because of the humidity and
rain," said the 22-year-old Cherono, whose personal best is 2:10:
37 set in the 1999 Berlin Marathon.
</P>
<P>
The temperature reached 21 degrees centigrade here on Sunday
and the humidity climbed to 96 percent, which is very difficult
for marathon runners.
</P>
<P>
"In this condition, I should say I am satisfied with my time,"
added Cherono.
</P>
<P>
Cherono, who has never won an international race, made his
marathon debut in 1997 and is now an up-and-coming marathon star
of his country.
</P>
<P>
Cherono and his compatriot Julius Omoyare led all the way
before he broke from the leading group at the last two kilometers
for the honor.
</P>
<P>
Omoyare finished second, 42 seconds behind Cherono. Hunda Rota
of Ethiopia ranked third in 2:22:45.
</P>
<P>
The women's title went to Russia's Irina Safarova, who finished
the 42.195 kilometers race in 2:46:59.
</P>
<P>
"I am not expected to win the title, it is my first marathon
victory," said the 31-year-old Irina, who finished fifth in the
Rome marathon last month.
</P>
<P>
Irina used to be a half-marathon runner and now focuses on full-
distance marathon.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Shujing from China finished second in 2:47:55 while
Romanian Adnana Barbu was third in 2:52:16.
</P>
<P>
There are 234 overseas runners from 26 countries and regions in
the race, and organizers registered a record entry for any race in
Hong Kong, with some 6,700 runners for the marathon, half-marathon
and 10-kilometer events.

<HEADLINE> Largest Jade Boulder Found in Northeast China County </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- A gigantic jade boulder,
weighting more than 60,000 tons, has been discovered in Xiuyan
County of northeast China's Liaoning Province, and regarded as the
world's largest.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Yan Jiancheng, head of Xiuyan
County Government, said they plan to carve figurines of Buddha out
of the huge semi-precious stone and build a park centered around
it in a hope of attracting more tourists.
</P>
<P>
Xiuyan, a county named after the unique jade it produces is
located at the place where Liaodong Peninsula in northeast China
rises, abounds in jade boulders which are the finest in texture.
It provides 80 percent of the raw materials for jade craftworks
made in China.
</P>
<P>
The jade stones and boulders have become Xiuyan's "engine" of
motivation for economic growth. According to local sources, nearly
70,000 locals out of the county's 500,000-plus residents are
employed in jade boulder related processing and marketing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, villages engaged in the processing of jade objects,
and wholesale markets of jade objects and stones have been
emerging as post-rain bamboo sprouts. By now, businesses engaged
in jade objects processing and crafting number some 3,000, which
generate an annual sum of approximately 400 million yuan (48.2
million US dollars) in output value at present.
</P>
<P>
Exquisite, fine-quality jade objects made locally are now being
sold nationwide and to more than 100 countries and regions, the
head of the county said.

<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- China spared no chance for the
opponents all the way to easily win the Beijing International
Ekiden Women's Road Race here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Famed Chinese coach Ma Junren surpervised the Chinese team.
</P>
<P>
With Ma's elite female runners Yin Lili, Dong Yanmei, Lan Lixin
and Li Ji and two other racers, the Chinese team led the field
from the start and covered the 42.195-kilometers relay course in
two hours, 15 minutes, 49 seconds to snatch the gold.
</P>
<P>
Mexico was far behind to settle for the second place at 2:18:31
and Ethiopia was third in 2:18:57. Japan, who was considered
China's main rivals, only finished fifth.
</P>
<P>
Though the Chinese failed to surpass the race's best time of 2:
11:41 set in 1998 by another Chinese team, also led by Ma, Ma said
he was satisfied with his athletes' performance. "The team
finished the competition as planed and took the title. I was
satisfied with the result and their performance." he told
reporters after the race.
</P>
<P>
"Our victory, however, does not mean too much because such top
teams as Romania and Bulgaria were not here. There is still a lot
for us to improve," he added.
</P>
<P>
Two other six-member Chinese teams all made up of Ma's athletes
finished one-two in the Friendship Women's Group and the winning
time was just one second slower than that of the Chinese team in
the international group.
</P>
<P>
"Ma's Army" of female runners, who broke long-distance world
records in 1993, were considered China's biggest medal hopes at
the Sydney Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> Bush Defeats McCain in Republican Primary in South Carolina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Texas Governor George W.
Bush decisively defeated Arizona Senator John McCain on Saturday
in the U.S. Republican primary in South Carolina, re-establishing
his front-runner status in the party's race for presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
With 77 percent of the vote counted, Bush had 225,689 votes or
54 percent while McCain netted 173,902 votes or 41 percent.
Another contender Alan Keyes ran a faraway third with only 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
"I'm relieved," acknowledged Bush, who lost to McCain with a 19
percentage point margin in New Hampshire's leadoff primary on
February 1.
</P>
<P>
"Relieved is not the right word. I'm excited and energized," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In response, McCain vowed to continue his fight as the race
intensified in larger states, saying: "We have just begun to fight.
"
</P>
<P>
The dramatic campaign produced a record turnout of about 600,
000 -- more than double the New Hampshire's, but it didn't help
McCain as he had hoped.
</P>
<P>
Exit polls showed that Bush won by a lopsided margin among
conservatives and regular Republicans. Six out of 10 voters in the
primary were Republican, and Bush won two-thirds of them.
</P>
<P>
McCain drew from Republican moderates, independents and
Democrats, but their coalition in South Carolina is not nearly the
force that created his victory in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
Bush hoped that the conservative-minded South Carolina state
would be his fire wall to stall McCain's surge and tone down any
damage from the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
McCain, after crushing Bush in New Hampshire, narrowed or
closed Bush's lead in state polls across the country, threatened
to undercut his fund-raising advantage and destroyed his carefully
cultivated image as the only Republican candidate to win the
Presidential election in November.
</P>
<P>
Supported by at least 34 of South Carolina's 37 delegates, Bush
has 61 of the 1,034 delegates needed to win the Republican
nomination, while McCain has 11.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Republicans will select delegates in Michigan and
Arizona, with three contests coming a week later. On March 7, over
a dozen states will hold primaries settling the nomination.
</P>
<P>
Bush put his presidential campaign back on track Saturday by
easily winning the decisive primary, turning next Tuesday's vote
in Michigan into a must-win for McCain, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, U.S. May Sign Nuclear Cooperation Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Dhaka and Washington are
planning to sign a 20-year nuclear cooperation agreement to revive
the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, the Bangladesh Observer Sunday
quoted diplomatic sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources indicated that the issue of nuclear cooperation
might be raised during U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to
Bangladesh on March 20.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear power project, initiated in 1962 at Ishwardi in
Pabna, 160 kilometers west of Dhaka, was virtually stalled due to
lack of interest by the previous governments as well as a shortage
of fund and technological assistance. The initial cost of the
plant is likely to be 900 million to one billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Atomic Energy Commission sources said that a 10-
year agreement earlier signed with Washington expired in 1992. The
new agreement, which will be the extension of the previous one,
may envisage transfer of nuclear technology.

<HEADLINE> China's Silk Industry Strives to Regain Past Glory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- China will reduce its silk
industry's production capacity by one third this year in a move to
improve the sector's economic benefits, today's China Daily "
Business Weekly" reported.
</P>
<P>
The country will also let 24 state-owned silk enterprises go
bankrupt this year and banks will therefore be saddled with
writing off 1.36 billion yuan in bad debts as a result.
</P>
<P>
Qualified factories will be urged to upgrade their reeling
machines and undertake innovations in techniques, designs and
colors, Fan Xun, secretary-general of the China National Silk
Association, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Fan, 29 programs will be helped with their
technical innovations this year with 1.54 billion yuan in
subsidized loans.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, state-owned silk-reeling factories will be helped to
ease their social burdens and to lower their debt-to-equity ratios,
according to the State Textile Industry Administration.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen 17 silk enterprises will be allowed to launch debt-to-
equity swaps in 2000, and this involves 2.02 billion yuan (250
million US dollars) in capital, as indicated the State Textile
Industry Administration sources.
</P>
<P>
The silk sector made 320 million yuan profits during the first
11 moths of 1999 after years' government efforts by to reform the
industry.
</P>
<P>
But the silk industry has yet to resume its past glory. And
about 65 percent of the state silk enterprises are losing money.
The country's silk exports totaled 2.8 billion U.S. dollars last
year, as against 3.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Silk export firms lost 350 million yuan, silk processing
factories reported 2.6 billion yuan in losses and farmers chopped
down more than 40 percent of the country's mulberry trees.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Nearly a million Sri Lankan
children between the ages of five and 17 years were working,
according to a latest comprehensive survey on child labor.
</P>
<P>
The Child Activity Survey of 1999, carried out by the
Department of Census and Statistics last year, estimated that of
the 4,344,770 children living in Sri Lanka at the time of the
survey, 926,038 or 21 percent of them were engaged in some form of
economic activity.
</P>
<P>
The survey, funded under the International Program for the
Elimination of Child Labor of the International Labor Organization,
was carried out among 14,400 housing units across Sri Lanka except
in the north and east where the long-running civil war made it
impossible to collect data.
</P>
<P>
Working children under the survey were categorized as paid
employees, self-employed and those who worked in family
enterprises but were unpaid.
</P>
<P>
"Of the 926,038 working children, 214,266 work for pay or
profit. Out of them, 26 percent earn less than 2,000 rupees (27.2
U.S. dollars) a month and more than half earn 1,000 rupees (13.6
dollars) or more a month," said the survey.
</P>
<P>
Child activists said that with the help of the survey
government planners on child labor and international and private
agencies involved in child welfare work should combine to work out
a common strategy to help children in need.

<HEADLINE> Experts in Favor of Credit Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- China must build up its credit
risk management system to improve its international trading
capabilities prior to joining the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
China Daily "Business Weekly" cited a consensus reached by
participants to a seminar held in Beijing as saying that credit
risk management services and commercial export credit insurance
are vital trading practices needed to operate successfully within
the WTO context.
</P>
<P>
At the joint sponsorship of the Gerling Research Center, the
CITIC Industrial Bank and Sinotrust, the seminar drew insurance
experts, representatives from more than 100 industrial firms,
officials from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, and the Export-Import Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Joachim Osinski, senior manager of Germany-based Gerling Credit
Insurance, said at the seminar that both Chinese corporations and
the country could benefit from the use of modern commercial risk
management and export credit insurance.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that China should further modernize and
liberalize its trade in order to be a member of WTO. "Export
credit insurance can help China become more competitive in its
core markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that reducing risks and losses, based on accurate
assessments and risk management, could safeguard a healthy economy
and social stability, especially in an economic undergoing a major
transition.
</P>
<P>
"China's insurance industry is moving in the direction of
liberalization," said Lin Guijun, dean of the School of Economics
at the Beijing-based University of International Business and
Economics. "It will produce a positive effect on building and
fostering a socialist market economy."
</P>
<P>
Other benefits that modern credit insurance could offer,
experts noted, include further improvements in China's trade
balance, more jobs in export-oriented industries, and increases in
tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
"An ultimate benefit is that it would enable China to increase
its participation in globalization and international product
specialization. This would bring more added value to the country
without increasing financial risk," said Lin.
</P>
<P>
Participants said corporations that introduce export credit
insurance will enhance their competitiveness, can offer better
payment terms, increase the quality and stability of their
customer bases and increase their export volume by focusing
efforts on prosperous and growing customers.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen Dianzuo, deputy manager of Sinotrust, cautioned
that China's export credit environment still requires improvement,
and said that the awareness of corporate leaders on this issue
should be heightened.
</P>
<P>
The government should set up more information channels, further
increase transparency and measures to stricter legal actions, Chen
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Texas Governor George W.
Bush defeated Senator John McCain in the U.S. Republican primary
in South Carolina State Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Bush's victory reclaimed momentum from his insurgent rival
McCain as the Republican race for presidential nomination turned
toward larger states.
</P>
<P>
According to 41 percent of precincts reporting, Bush won 53
percent of the vote while McCain got 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
The exit polls showed that Bush won by a lopsided margin among
his base supporters, conservatives and Republicans while McCain
failed to pull together a winning coalition of moderates,
independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Six out of 10 voters in the primary were Republican, and Bush
won two-thirds of them.
</P>
<P>
With his victory in pivotal South Carolina primary, Bush would
restore confidence and bolster his front-runner status in the race
for presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
McCain, who defeated Bush with a 19 point margin in the New
Hampshire primary on February 1, will have to regroup quickly. In
just three days Republicans will select delegates in Michigan and
Arizona, and then in two other states a week later. On March 7,
over a dozen states will hold primaries that could settle the
nomination.

<HEADLINE> U.S. State Department Expels Cuban Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
ordered Saturday the expulsion of a Cuban diplomat accused of
having link with the Cuban-born U.S. immigration official who was
arrested on spy charges two days ago.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat, who is working at a Cuban mission in Washington
and whose name was not released, was given a week to leave the
country for activities "incompatible with his diplomatic status,"
State Department spokesman James Foley said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, following a government sting operation,
Mariano Paget, a supervisor in the Miami office of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service, was arrested for allegedly
spying for Havana.
</P>
<P>
The expelled diplomat was seen as a Washington contact of Faget
who has been passing on classified information about Cuban
defectors for some time, the U.S. authorities claimed without
going into detail.
</P>
<P>
In Cuba, a government statement condemned the U.S. espionage
charges and the expulsion request as a "desperate and spectacular
maneuver."
</P>
<P>
"Never in 22 years has the Cuban Interest Section in Washington
carried out intelligence activities," the statement said, adding
that the Cuban government will not withdraw any officer.

<HEADLINE> China to Slash 2000 Steel Output by 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Steel output in January
dropped to 10.03 million tons from 11.23 million tons last
December, today's "China Daily Business Weekly" reported, quoting
sources from the State Administration of Metallurgical Industry as
saying.
</P>
<P>
China plans to cut steel output by 10 percent this year to
reduce tremendous steel surplus, and to raise prices of steel
products and the metallurgical sector's profits.
</P>
<P>
Seven teams were organized by the administration in January to
conduct strict inspections into 46 key steel enterprises
nationwide to make sure that they reduce output.
</P>
<P>
Average prices of these enterprises' main steel products have
increase by 31 yuan per ton since last December thanks to the
overall output reduction and price rises on the international
steel market.
</P>
<P>
The price of hot-rolled thin steel plates has increased by 238
yuan (28.67 US dollars) per ton. But the price of the product on
the domestic market dropped by 150 yuan (18 US dollars) per ton
last year because the metallurgical industry failed to control
steel output and imports.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts said the industry's profits are expected to
grow by a big margin this year as the output reduction efforts
continue.
</P>
<P>
The industry is aiming for 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion US
dollars) in profits this year, according to the State Economic and
Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
Steel enterprises also exported 550,000 tons more steel in
January than during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The country plans to increase steel exports to 5 million tons
this year. Enterprises have been encouraged to export steel
products as much as they can to minimize their steel inventories.

<HEADLINE> Albright Warns Albania Against Expansionist Ambitions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Saturday warned Albania against any
expansionist ambitions that could further destabilize the region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing parliament during a brief visit to Tirana, Albright
said Albania "must not allow itself to be used by those who would
create conflict in the region."
</P>
<P>
She said the United States is opposed to any attempts to "
redraw the map of southeastern Europe."
</P>
<P>
"Attempts to expand boundaries are an invitation to violence,
not peace and stability. And certainly, the international
community would no sooner accept a greater Albania than it would a
greater Serbia or Croatia," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright urged Kosovo's Albanians to respect other people in
the region. "Kosovo has never been and should never be a mono-
ethnic identity," she said.
</P>
<P>
She also urged Albania to move forward with reforms, and
promised U.S. backing for Tirana's efforts to fully join the Euro-
Atlantic community.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference with Albanian Prime Minister Ilir Meta,
Albright said: "There are some elements of Albanians in various
places that are taking actions that are worrisome in terms of
trying to get stability."
</P>
<P>
She added that President Rexhep Meidani and the prime minister
had made it quite clear in conversations with her that it was not
the policy or interest of their government to weaken stability.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived here early Saturday, after attending the
inauguration of Croatian President Stipe Mesic in Zagreb on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Exporters Shift Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Colombian companies
are redirecting exports to countries with political stability and
better economic performance, an exporters insurance company
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the company, the SEGUREXPO, applications for risk
coverage it received from private companies have indicated a shift
to such markets as Mexico and Peru from traditional ones like
Venezuela and Ecuador, which suffer economic crisis and political
instability.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Colombia's exports to Mexico increased by a
remarkable 56 percent, in contrast to a drop of 20 percent and 44
percent respectively with Venezuela and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
It reported a 3.47 percent decline in exports to Peru, an
Andean Community member state, compared with a 23 percent fall
from the 1998 level in those to all its Andean trading partners.
</P>
<P>
Both Mexico and Peru registered an economic growth close to 3
percent in 1999, when Venezuela saw its growth rate down 7.2
percent due to declined domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Colombian businesses were also discouraged by Venezuelan moves
to limit the traffic of Colombian trucks and block the entry of
Colombian products like roasted coffee and meat.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the SEGUREXPO still maintains its restriction on
risk coverage in Ecuador, where, in less than one year, part of
public savings was frozen, payment of the foreign debt suspended,
and President Jamil Mahuad deposed.

<HEADLINE> Cuba on Alert Against Pest Plague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Vegetal Health Research
Institute of Cuba on Saturday warned against an impending
agricultural plague in the country caused by an insect pest called
"pink flour bug."
</P>
<P>
Agricultural expert Eliel Pena said that the insect had caused
plague in Puerto Rico, California and Belize last year. The
Caribbean region is now under its threat because of the rapid
movement and reproduction of the insect.
</P>
<P>
The insect, called the Maconellicoccus Hirsutus Green by
scientists, extracts sap from soft tissues of leaves and injects a
toxic saliva into them, leading to a low yield, sometimes even the
death of the plant, said Pena.
</P>
<P>
Foreign tourists, fresh cargo arriving at sea and air ports as
well as the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo, east of Havana, could
all bring the insect into Cuba, the expert noted.
</P>
<P>
The Maconellicoccus Hirsutus Green first appeared in Egypt in
1908, and has since extended to Tropical Africa, Asia, and north
Australia.
</P>
<P>
The insect attacks more than 300 species of plants, including
truck garden plants, forest plants and fruit trees, said Pena.

<HEADLINE> Austrians Stage Largest Post-War Anti-Government Demonstration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- About 250,000 Austrians staged
the country's largest demonstration since World War II in Vienna
Saturday to protest against the inclusion of Joerg Haider's far-
right Freedom Party in the government.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, tens of thousands of protesters gathered at
rallies at different places around the capital. In the afternoon,
they started marching towards the center of the capital. Later at
dusk, they converged on the Heldenplatz, or Heroes' Square, to
hold the main rally.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of Demokratische Offensive (Democratic Offensive)
and Sos Mitmensch (Help Others), two organizers of the rally,
addressed the masses. Politicians and social celebrities joined
the speeches in condemning racism and the Freedom Party, which has
just formed the new coalition with conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Anti-government rallies have taken place many times in Austria
since February 4 when the new government of the People's Party led
by Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel and the Freedom Party led by
Joerg Haider took office.
</P>
<P>
Haider, known for his statements praising some Nazi policies
and his firm opposition to immigration, outrages Europeans and
Jews. The European Union, Israel and the United States have taken
measures to isolate Austria diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Saturday's demonstrations were peaceful. Non-
governmental organizations were in charge of the rally, but
opposition parties and labor organizations were all present.
Organizers said that the protests will go on.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Going All Out to Reduce Soil-Eroded Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Soil-eroded areas were
reduced by 1,100 square kilometers in northwest China's Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region last year.
</P>
<P>
This has greatly improved local conservation and is largely due
to efforts made to curb desertification over the past decades.
</P>
<P>
The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has long suffered from
sandstorms and soil erosion. The desertification has destroyed
large areas of arable land.
</P>
<P>
Forest belts have been erected to protect local farmland,
highways and railways. The autonomous region has also built a
number of water-control projects to cultivate the desert.
</P>
<P>
Xihaigu Prefecture, one of the least developed areas in
northwest China, for example, undertook 20 major water-control
projects to turn barren land into fertile farmland in 1999, and
completed 14 of them by the end of the year, involving more than
820,000 cubic meters of earth work and some one million cu m of
stone work.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture Plays Smaller Role in Foreign Trade, China Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua)-- The days are long gone when
trading potatoes for steel with the former Soviet Union were a
unique feature of China's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
An article carried by the China Daily Business Weekly today
said China's accelerated industrialization process has changed the
country's traditional image as one of the world's largest
agricultural producers and exporters.
</P>
<P>
Tang Yanli, an economist with the Ministry of Agriculture is
quoted as saying that the proportion of farm produce in China's
total foreign trade is waning.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural products accounted for only 6.9 percent, or 13.54
billion U.S. dollars of the country's total exports in 1999, down
0.6 percentage points from that of the previous year, she said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that China imported 8.21 billion U.S. dollars worth
of agricultural products in 1999, or 5 percent of its total
imports, down a percentage point from 1998.
</P>
<P>
Despite the general revival of Asian economy from the financial
turmoil, China's agricultural exports and imports have not yet
bounced back, she added.
</P>
<P>
To a great extent, according to the agricultural expert,
universally changing trade policies, diversified international
markets and effects of the Asian financial turmoil, which emerged
in 1977, have all defined the fate of China's foreign trade in
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Exports of farm produce to other Asian countries dropped 9.95
billion U.S. dollars during the 1998-99 period, and 1999 saw a
year-on-year decrease of 14.5 percent in agricultural exports to
Europe, traditionally China's second largest market.
</P>
<P>
However, Tang said that such its exports of agricultural
produce to America, Africa and Oceania grew last year, thus
showing an improvement in the country's traditional single-market
foreign trade in agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
In light of the fierce competitions following China's upcoming
entry to the WTO, possibly in this year, the Ministry of
Agriculture is urging Chinese agricultural producers and traders
to embrace the latest technologies, be frugal with production
costs, and upgrade qualities and varieties.
</P>
<P>
The central government's call to vigorously develop China's
West is also creating opportunities for domestic producers and
traders to access the world market, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
China's top five agricultural exporters, namely, Shandong,
Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Liaoning provinces in terms of
their trade volume, made up 58.8 percent of the country's total
foreign trade in farm produce in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the top five agricultural importers are Guangdong,
Shandong and Jiangsu provinces, and Beijing and Shanghai
municipalities, which make up 65.7 percent of the total last year.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Incentives Attract Investors Westward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua)-- The Chinese government is
considering new incentives designed to encourage more investment
in the vast central and western areas, the China Daily Business
Weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), customary anonymity, the government
will adopt more flexible policies to further open up the central
and western areas to investment from overseas, especially from
multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
Special incentives will encourage foreign investment in
agriculture, husbandry, environmental protection, education,
tourism, energy and raw materials industries.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to combine foreign investment absorption and
resources exploitation," said the official.
</P>
<P>
Current restrictions on the scope of foreign investment will be
eased toward projects in the above-mentioned areas. In addition,
governmental support will also help businesses gain a foothold in
the hinterland.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the officials noted, the scope of the use of pilot
businesses using foreign-investment in retail commerce, finance,
insurance and other service industries will be larger in those
areas than in the eastern coastal area.
</P>
<P>
Citing the central and western areas' advantage in raw
materials industries and good investment opportunities in
husbandry, mineral resource exploitation, infrastructural
construction and tourism, he insisted that the areas bear huge
market potential.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the great potential, current inconveniences in
transportation and the backward infrastructural facilities have to
a certain degree dampened investors' interest in looking west, the
official acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
Thus, intensifying efforts to improve such "soft investment
environment" comes atop the government's agenda.
</P>
<P>
Too little foreign capital has so far found its way to the
areas. And MOFTEC statistics indicate that the first 11 months of
1999 saw only 778 projects established in the areas, involving 1.
93 billion U.S. dollars in pledged capital and 914 million in
actual input, respectively accounting for 5.42 percent and 2.47
percent of the nation's total.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Seven National
Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla members and two Colombian army
soldiers died Saturday in combats in the northeast of Colombia,
said military authorities.
</P>
<P>
The fighting took place in the Convention mountains in Norte de
Santander department on the border with Venezuela after a group of
ELN guerrillas blew up the Cano Limon-Cavenas oil pipeline, said
General Martin Alonso Carreno, commander of the army brigade in
the region.
</P>
<P>
He said the troops were protecting the technicians and workers
of the state oil company who were repairing the damaged oil
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The ELN, Colombia's second largest guerrilla force, has
declared pipelines to be one of its military targets in its
protests against multinational oil companies operating in the
country. The group has carried out almost 700 attacks on pipelines
across Colombia since it was established in 1986.

<HEADLINE> Rich Mineral Resources in NW China to be Tapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China is endowed
with mineral resources worth 33.7 trillion yuan (4.06 trillion US
dollars) which remain to be exploited, an official with the
Ministry of Land and Resources said here this week.
</P>
<P>
Major mineral products include coal, petroleum and gas, nickel,
copper, gold and sylvite. The probable reserve of coal surpasses
300 billion tons, representing approximately 30 percent of the
country's total. They are scattered throughout Shaanxi, Xinjiang
and Ningxia in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
The reserve of petroleum in northwest China totals 510 million
tons, accounting for nearly 23 percent of the on-shore oil in
China. Its gas reserve is estimated at 435.4 billion cubic meters,
or over 58 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Gansu Province has some 62 percent of the nickel and 57 percent
of the molybdenum in China. And Qinghai Province possesses 97
percent of the sylvite in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the government strategy to accelerate economic growth in
western China, seven major mineral projects are expected to be
built in the northwest. They include a gasfield in an area
bordering Shaanxi and Gansu provinces and the Ningxia Hui Ethnic
Group Autonomous region, a non-ferrous mine at the upper reaches
of the Yellow River and a chemical zone at Qaidam Basin, energy,
iron and steel and chemical zones in eastern Xinjiang and along
Gansu Corridor, and an oil and gas zone in southern Xinjiang.

first victory in two months with a 2-0 win over Coventry City in a

Robson revealed in the run up to the game that he has been too
depressed to go out on a Saturday night amid a desperate run of
form.

<P>
But goals from Italian defender Gianluca Festa and Hamilton
Ricard inside 20 minutes put the smile firmly back on his face.
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot happier Saturday than I've had for a long time," he
admitted. "The lads worked hard for it, they turned the ball in
behind Coventry, got in behind them, pressed Coventry really well
and worked hard for the three points.
</P>
<P>
"We cut out the daft mistakes that we've been making to concede
early goals and today for a change, we got a bit of luck on the
corner when a Coventry player miss-kicked the ball and we scored
the early goal," he said.

<HEADLINE> British Sports Minister: Unruly Players Face Prosecution  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Football clubs must clamp down
on their unruly players or face possible police prosecutions,
British sports minister Kate Hoey has warned.
</P>
<P>
Her warning comes at the end of a week which has seen several
Premiership clubs under fire for indiscipline and bad behaviour on
and off the pitch.
</P>
<P>
In an article in The Sunday Telegraph, Hoey urged the football
authorities to purge "yob ethics" from the game, and said that the
vast incomes provided by TV contracts have left the game "too big
for its boots".
</P>
<P>
Leeds, Chelsea, Tottenham and Wimbledon were all involved in
brawls last weekend, while Leicester attracted censure for its
team's poor behaviour in a Spanish resort.
</P>
<P>
Hoey named the clubs, along with Manchester United as raising
concern, listing her worries as intimidation of referees, brawling
on and off the pitch and drunken antics.
</P>
<P>
"There is a behavioural crisis in English football," Hoey said.
"It cannot be blamed on 'media hype', to use the phrase of Sir
Alex Ferguson, Manchester United's manager."
</P>
<P>
Hoey warned that, if clubs will not restrain their teams for
fear of upsetting talented and popular players, the Government is
ready to act.
</P>
<P>
"We shall take whatever action is necessary. This may well mean
a complete reappraisal of the penalties that can be imposed," Hoey
added.
</P>
<P>
"I would advise clubs that the police can always consider
whether some on-the-field behaviour merits their attention, rather
than the game's internal disciplinary remedies," she wrote.

</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Swede, who has won six titles in his career, is
seeking for his first title in the United States.
</P>
<P>

the first 6-3.
</P>

Larsson, seeded 16th, took the tiebreaker 7-2 and cruised to
serve out the match with a 6-4 third-set win.

<HEADLINE> Barak Expects Framework Deal in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- After missing the February 13
deadline for reaching a framework agreement on a permanent peace
with the Palestinians, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Sunday that
he now expected a deal in May.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing to excite about if we reach a framework
agreement in May," Israel Radio quoted him as saying at a weekly
cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement signed last year,
Israel and the Palestinians were to have reached a framework
agreement on final status issues on February 13.
</P>
<P>
But the deadline passed without anything on the paper since
peace talks over the final status issues such as the fate of
Jerusalem, the Jewish settlements and Palestinian refugees broke
down on February 3.
</P>
<P>
The talks stalled over an overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from
more West Bank land. The Palestinians accused Israel of
unilaterally deciding the areas to be handed over without
consulting them as agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
At the cabinet meeting, Barak blamed the Palestinians for the
failure to meet the February 13 deadline, saying that they refused
an Israeli idea proposed in January to hold 20 days of intensive
negotiations to reach a framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
After the deadline passed, the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) has suggested that the two sides skip over the framework
agreement, which was the idea proposed by Barak, and focus efforts
on the final peace treaty to be sealed by September.
</P>
<P>
"The deadline for the framework agreement has ended, so we
should move directly to the comprehensive accord," Arafat said
Saturday in the West Bank town of Bethlehem after a meeting with
visiting German President Johannes Rau.

<HEADLINE> Iran Tops Mideast in Insurance Revenue Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran's insurance industry stood
first in the Middle East last year in terms of growth in generating
insurance revenue, a senior insurance official said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Iran's insurance industry generated 2,019 billion rials (about
673 million U.S. dollars) in revenue last year, which was 30.9
percent more than the figure in the previous year, said Abdulnaser
Hemmati, head of Iran's Central Insurance Organization (ICIO), the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the per capita revenue in the country's insurance
industry reached 32,657 rials (about 10.9 dollars) and the ratio of
premiums to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was 0.62 percent last
year, Hemmati told the General Assembly meeting of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
He added a 52.4 percent growth was registered in insurance
premiums in the period from March to November 1999, compared to the
figure within the corresponding period the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In its meeting, the ICIO ratified the statistics on the
performance of the country's insurance industry last year.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Economy and Finance Hossein Namazi Namazi said the
third five-year economic development plan, to begin in March 2000,
envisages private sector involvement in the insurance industry,
which will create a sense of competition.
</P>
<P>
The plan stipulates a 22-percent average annual growth in
insurance premiums, which are expected to increase to over 5,000
billion rials (about 1666.7 million dollars) in 2003 from more than
2,000 billion rials (about 666.7 million dollars) in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Minister Justifies President's Foreign Trips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Information Minister
Dapo Sarum Sunday justified President Olusegun Obasanjo's frequent
foreign trips as helping "regain Nigeria's long-lost glories".
</P>
<P>
The minister made the statement in Johannesburg, South Africa,
apparently in reaction to criticism at home on the president's
frequent foreign visits.
</P>
<P>
The president did not "travel for fun", but for the debt
relief, more international assistance and other urgent issues, the
News Agency of Nigeria quoted Sarum as saying.
</P>
<P>
The president's foreign trips were aimed at Nigeria's re-entry
into the international community and attract trade and investment,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The president is the "greatest asset Nigeria presently has",
Sarum said, adding that the most populous African country should
take full advantage of Obasanjo's global personality.

ATHENS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- At least seven people were
killed and more than 20 others injured later Sunday in a traffic
accident near the central Greek city of Lamia.

A bus carrying about 50 people collided with a wrecker truck on

<P>
Four of the seven victims were in the two cars that crashed

incessant rain.

member European Union (EU) countries, with some 1,500 people
killed and 30,000 others injured annually in accidents.
