<HEADLINE> Tibetan People Have Final Say on Tibet Issue: Official (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wolf also elaborated the religious situation, saying that
"(Tibetan) people, religion and culture will continue to grow
fainter and could one day disappear."
</P>
<P>
Raidi said that, in truth, "China's national policy of freedom
in religious belief has been strictly implemented in Tibet."
According to him, the central government in recent years allocated
more than 200 million yuan to renovate and support 1,700 sites of
worship, including the Potala Palace, Johkang Monastery,
Gandian Monastery, and Samyai Monastery.
</P>
<P>
Tibet now has over 46,000 monks and nuns and they can freely
carry out their religious activities, he said. "There are
followers praying with prayer wheels in hand in all major
monasteries in Lhasa and no one interferes in their activities,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Raidi also spoke on the importance of improving the management
on religious activities in accordance with the law. "We will not
allow religions to interfere with the administrative and judicial
matters, education and marriage affairs. Moreover, it is also
prohibited blackmailing or endangering the lives and property of
the people in the name of religion, and the abolished feudal
privileges are also not permitted to be resumed," Raidi added.
</P>
<P>
"The reason to crack down on activities held by the separatists
who are acting under cover of religion is to protect the majority
of the religious believers and ensure that the religious
activities are carried out in line with the doctrines," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Dalai Lama and his associates, Raidi said the
separatist group led by the Dalai Lama had become the anti-China
tool ever since they betrayed the motherland and moved to live in
exile in 1959.
</P>
<P>
He never concerned himself with the real life of the Tibetan
people and did nothing beneficial for Tibet. The Tibetan people,
thus far, are now aware of his separatist theory and have long
abandoned him, Raidi said.

<P>
In the development of the Tibetan culture, Raidi said both the
Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the Law on
Regional Autonomy of China's Minority Nationalities have
explicitly set out provisions demanding that the ethnic culture in
the Tibet Autonomous Region be respected, protected and advanced.
</P>
<P>
"Our ethnic culture is progressing at an unprecedented pace for
the present, and the Tibetan language is widely used in the
autonomous region, since the central government has full respect
for the Tibetan language and makes every effort to protect it,"
Raidi said.
</P>
<P>
All the regulations, resolutions, documents, and media reports
in Tibet appear in two languages, Chinese and Tibetan, according
to Raidi.
</P>
<P>
The region also drafted special regulations to encourage wider
use of the local language, and has also set up special
institutions for exclusive research on the Tibetan language.
</P>
<P>
According to Raidi, marked achievements have been scored in the
language research, and also in discovering and and preserving
Tibet's exquisite cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
For example, tens of thousands of copies of The King Gesser, an
ancient Tibetan folk epic, have been published in Tibet, with more
scheduled to come out in the future.
</P>
<P>
"All these are clear indications that the Tibetan culture is
progressing by the day instead of growing fainter and could one
day disappear as Frank Wolf predicted," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Facts speak louder than words," Raidi said. "All the changes
that took place in Tibet over the past forty-plus years have been
known not only by people with a sense of justice, even those
officials with the former Tibet government are also truly
convinced after they returned from exile and saw the changes."
</P>
<P>
"But the anti-China forces in the United States and other
Western nations, out of a desire to split China and destroy the
national unity of the Chinese people, have always schemed to look
for a bone in an egg, confound right and wrong, and confuse and
poison people's minds regardless of the the happy lives the
Tibetan people are leading," added the chairman.
</P>
<P>
"And that also explains why US congressman Frank Wolf should
slip into Tibet stealthily and afterwards launch a malicious
attack to vilify the Tibetan people," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan people will always open their arms to friendly
visitors of all kinds, but those who spread lies out of hostility
and maliciousness will be unwelcome in the region, Raidi said.

<P>
HONG KONG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese diplomat met with
the Philippine consul-general in Hong Kong this morning and
demanded an early release of the Chinese fishermen and the boat
detained by Philippine authorities, an official spokesman said
here today.
</P>
<P>
In an urgent meeting with Philippine Consul-general Estrella
Berenuel, Jiang Changshi, director of the Consular Department of
the Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Commissioner in Hong
Kong, said that the fishermen and the boat have been detained
for more than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine side had offered to deal with the issue as soon
as possible, but has so far failed to solve it in a proper way,
Dai noted, adding that the Chinese side has expressed its deep
regret over this.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong-registered fishing boat was detained by the
Philippines in the South China Sea on July 31, with 23 fishermen
aboard, including three Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official hoped that the Philippine side will not
make the issue a complicated one and urged an early release of
both the crew and the boat.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine consul-general said that he will report to his
government immediately.

<P>
HONG KONG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- World number one Brazil and
Olympic champions United States both qualified for the semi-finals
after they finished as winners of the two quarter-final groups at
the on-going Kent Beach Volleyball Grand Slam in the Victoria Park
here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The semi-finals and final of the four-day event are all set for
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, in Group A, took the top spot after their 2-0 wins over
China, Japan and Australia here today while Australia, who, after
losing to Brazil, beat Japan and China 2-0, took the second place.
</P>
<P>
China won over Japan 2-0 but lost to Brazil and Australia both
in 2-0 and thus finished third in the group and winless Japan were
fourth and last.
</P>
<P>
In Group B, the United States, who scored 2-0 wins over Mexico,
South Africa and New Zealand, won the group's top position.
Mexico, with 2-0 wins over New Zealand and South Africa and one
loss to the United States, finished as the runners-up.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand and South Africa were third and fourth of the
group.
</P>
<P>
The top two teams of the two groups advanced into the
semi-finals slated for Sunday, with Brazil playing Mexico and
Australia taking on United States in the morning and the final is
slated for Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The third and fourth placers of the groups are to play for the
fifth to eighth placers, also on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The most impressive match in the Plate category today was
probably that between Hong Kong and India, which Hong Kong won.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time in history that any Hong Kong team had
ever won a beach volleyball match. The four joyful players sprayed
soft drinks on each other in post-match celebrations.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy for this historical victory. We won the match
by playing a clever game against the Indians," said the team's
coach Cheng King Leung.
</P>
<P>
"The Indians are taller and we could not win just by spiking.
So I asked my players to switch to fast attacks, which worked," he
added.
</P>
<P>
China, who finished fifth last year, faces New Zealand tomorrow
for the fifth place and Japan meet South Africa for the seventh
place.

<P>
Netanyahu's first far east trip came at a time of deepening
diplomatic isolation since the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
came to a halt due to Israeli building of the controversial Har
Homa settlement in East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
Israel has also been criticized internationally for imposing
tough sanctions against the Palestinians after the July 30 twin
suicide bombings in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market, which
killed 16 people and further chilled the Israeli-Palestinian
relations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Japanese officials have been making punctilious
preparations for Netanyahu's two-day visit to Japan. The
Japanese hosts have been astounding their Israeli counterparts
by insisting on strict observance of diplomatic protocol at
every step of the way.
</P>
<P>
Months of preliminary work have been invested by both
countries in an effort to make Netanyahu's trip a political and
economic success.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the discussion of increasing trade between
Israel and Japan, Netanyahu is expected to talk about the issue
of Japan's effort to gain acceptance as a permanent member of
the United Nations Security Council and its impact on the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is scheduled to arrive at Seoul next Wednesday for
a two-day visit to South Korea. Two bilateral agreements will be
signed during the visit, one on agricultural cooperation and the
other on telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-South Korean trade has been expanding rapidly in
recent years to 700 million U.S. dollars in 1996 from only 100
million dollars in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade already totaled 450 million dollars during
the first half of this year, with a prospective trade of one
billion dollars for the whole year.

<HEADLINE> AL Criticizes Israeli Plans to Build Dam on Yarmuk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League today strongly
criticized the decision of the Israeli government to build a dam
on Al Yarmuk river which Syria wants to restore.
</P>
<P>
Zakraia Ismail, AL Assistant Secretary General for Political
Affairs, said this decision represents "a new chapter in the
series of provocations and blackmailing practiced by Israel."
</P>
<P>
He believed that these Israeli policies which conflict with UN
Security Council resolutions and the land for peace principle will
be doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
"It is noteworthy that the spokesman of the Israeli
Infrastructure Ministry said the decision to move the site of the
dam inside the demilitarized zone was taken for technical
reasons," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Maariv newspaper reported on Friday that Israel is
planning to establish a dam on the Yarmuk river, which runs across
the southern Golan Heights, occupied by Israel since 1967.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binjamin Netanyahu has approved a
relevant proposal by Minister of Infrastructure Ariel Sharon,
reversing another decision taken by late Premier Yitzhak Rabin on
establishing the dam in a region further in the south, said the
paper.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been frozen since Netanyahu
resumed power in May 1996. Netanyahu rejected Damascus' insistence
on full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights in return for
full peace with the Jewish state, as verbally agreed by the
previous Labor government.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Continues in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Fighting between Israeli troops
and Lebanese Hezbullah guerrillas erupted again today in south
Lebanon as the ceasefire monitoring committee is deliberating the
complaints by Israel and Lebanon of truce violations.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese official National News Agency reported that
today's fighting mainly focused on the the western and central
sectors of the Israeli-established "security zone" in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Israeli warplanes fired at least
six air-to-surface missiles in three sorties over the areas near
the village of Yater and between Jbal el Batm and Zabqine in
the western sector of the border enclave at 9:10 am (6:10
GMT) and 11:00 am (8:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Besides the air raids, Israeli troops also bombarded the same
areas with 120 mm and 155 mm shells at 10:00 am (7:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The clashes between the guerrillas of Hezbullah, or Party of
God, and Israeli troops, which took place in three other areas in
the western sector of the buffer zone today, lasted several hours.
</P>
<P>
The casualties of the clash were not officially announced, but
the Hezbullah said in its statement that the battle caused death
and injury to the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Naqoura, just near the sites of fighting, the
five-nation ceasefire monitoring committee is deliberating the
complaints of truce violations presented by Lebanon and Israel
after three consecutive days of meeting.
</P>
<P>
The committee, made up of the delegates from the United States,
France, Israel, Syria and Lebanon and established after last
year's 16-day blitz of Lebanon by Israel, was unable to reach a
consensus over whether or not Israel should be blamed for
Monday's shelling of the Lebanese port city of Saida where nine
civilians were killed and nearly 40 others wounded.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Imported Beef Free of Bacteria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Examination result showed
that Kuwait's imported frozen beef from the United States was not
contaminated by the deadly E. Coli bacteria, easing fears of the
local people, a Kuwaiti health official said today.
</P>
<P>
Al-Saif, assistant undersecretary at Kuwaiti Health Ministry
for community health affairs said "all meat samples, processed or
unprocessed, imported from the United States proved free of any
bacteria."
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Health Ministry and Kuwait Municipality took
samples on August 18 from all shops, stores and supermarkets that
deal in meat imported from the U.S. and sent the samples to
laboratories of the ministry for examination following reports of
the issue floated in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Agriculture Department ordered a couple of weeks ago
that a huge amount of frozen beef be withdrawn from the market
for fear that they were contaminated with deadly E. Coli
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
Al-Saif said that the ministry had been following up the
E. Coli bacteria issue with the World Health Organization since
it was reported, stressing that the ministry's laboratories are
extremely effective and reliable.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, deputy director of the nutrition department at the
Kuwaiti Municipality Jaman Al-Hajri said that authorities
regularly takes samples of all imported food products for tests
to make sure they are fit for human consumption.
</P>
<P>
He said additional samples of beef were also attained to
double check that they are free from the said bacteria, which
leads to kidney failure and ultimately death.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait imports food products from many foreign countries,
including the U.S. Australia and European states. All kinds of
imported food supplies are always subject to inspection before
reaching consumers in the Gulf state.

<HEADLINE> Official: Jordan to Build Dam on Yarmouk River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 23 (Xinhua) - Jordan announced today it will
build a dam on the Yarmouk River to get the share of water it
deserves to help solve water shortage problem.
</P>
<P>
An official spokesman, who declined to be named, made the
statement after recent media reports that Israel is planning to
build its own dam at upper reaches of the same river in order to
crash Jordan's pursuit for more water, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordan will construct a dam at Aladasia to divert its share of
the Yarmouk water to the King Abdullah Channel, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Everything has been ready for the project which is totally
financed by Jordan itself and can save water from the river to
serve its people after being finished, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 1994 peace treaty between Jordan and Israel includes
provision to construct such a dam on the Yarmouk River, which
mainly crosses the border between Israel and Syria and spreads
branches into the territory of Jordan, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Jordan is committed to implement the articles
agreed by both sides in a way that does not affect the interests
of any third party.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was surprised by media reports that Israel plans to
construct a dam on the Yarmouk River in Elahama in consent with
Jordan. The spokesman denied such a claim.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he added, the Jordanian government has not and
will not enter any agreements or negotiations with Israel that
will affect the results of peace negotiations between any Arab
country and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Shortage of water has been a problem for most of the Arab
countries in the Middle East and Israel. Jordan has always been
pursuing water in various ways as it is far below the water-poor
country line of 1,000 cubic meters per capita per year.
</P>
<P>
Jordan shares most of its surface water resources with
neighboring countries but had been deprived of its fair share,
resulting in severe shortage of the country's water supply.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 23 (Xinhua) - Dialogues for compromise continued
here today between the Jordanian government and some opposition
parties that declared to boycott the Parliamentary elections to
be held in November.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of State for Information Affairs Samir
Mutawe' affirmed this today after a cabinet meeting chaired by
Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Mutawe' also said that another meeting is to take place
this week between the government and the opposition parties
to settle the disputes that arose last month as altogether
six opposition parties have claimed to boycot the elections.
</P>
<P>
The parties sticked to their position after the government
decided to hold elections, citing the Press and Publication Law,
the one-person-one-vote election system, the normalization of ties
with Israel and the government`s measures to marginalize political
parties as the main reasons behind their boycott.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties now make up 23 seats in the 80-member
Lower House of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Multi-party system was revived in the country in 1989 as
part of the political reforms launched after widespread riots
set off by economic hardships.

<HEADLINE> Emergency Rule to Be Lifted in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will remove the
10-year-old emergency rule in southeastern Turkey by early next
year, Deputy Prime Minister Ismet Sezgin announced today.
</P>
<P>
"Emergency rule will be lifted either at the end of this year
or at the start of 1998," Sezgin was quoted as saying by the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Emergency rule has been imposed in nine southeastern provinces
since 1987, giving soliders and police more extensive powers of
arrest and detention in the fight against the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Reliable official sources said that Turkey made the move
because the task of fighting the PKK has been basically completed
and there is no need to keep the emergency rule in those areas.
</P>
<P>
Sezgin, also Defense Minister, said that the village guard
system, which was established to counter the PKK, will continue
their function in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government has employed more than 60,000 militia
in the village guard, but these guards have been accused by the
media of involvement in extortion, drug trafficking and other
illegal matters.
</P>
<P>
The PKK existence has long been termed as the most dangerous
threat to the border security of southeastern Turkey, leading to a
large scale military campaign in mid-May by the Turkish troops in
northern Iraq where PKK have taken shelter and launched
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
More than 26,000 people, including soldiers, rebels and
civilians, have been killed in the 13-year-old separatist war by
the PKK fighting for an independent Kurdish state.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Suggests Restructure of Tanzanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) today
suggested that the Tanzanian government restructure the country's
power sector to make it financially viable.
</P>
<P>
The WB Regional Vice-President for Africa, Callisto Madavu,
told local reporters in Dar es Salaam that such a move is
necessary as at present the situation is that most power
consumers, including government and parastatal institutions do
not pay for the energy provided them by the Tanzania Electric
Supply Company (TANESCO).
</P>
<P>
Now, various government institutions owe TANESCO 12.1 billion
shillings (20 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Once the power sector is restructured, people, including
parastatal organizations will be able to pay for the power they
consume, Madavu said, and adding, "...our aim is to put the power
company on sound financial footing."
</P>
<P>
The WB position, however, has irked industrialists and power
consumers who complain that the move would burden them since
electricity is now the basic utility for Tanzanians.

LUSAKA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government said
today that tendancies by some tribes to feel more superior than
others are a recipe of ethnic tension and division in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Local government and housing minister Bennie Mwiinga said here
today that Zambia is a unitary state and no tribe is superior
over others.
</P>
<P>
At the eighth freedom forum he said no ethnic group has the
right to redicule another ethnic group because no one has a
choice to be born in a particular tribe.
</P>
<P>
The minister accused some pliticians of making tribal politics
their career and ending up dividing the nation in their quest for
political power at all costs.
</P>
<P>
He noted intermarriages, urbanization and good government
policies have contributed to the creation of a strong ethnic
society which can not be easily broken.
</P>
<P>
Tetani Banda, leader of the National Democratic Party, said at
the forum that there is need to put in place deliberate policies
that will ensure tribal balancing in the various organs of the
country to maintain peace and stability in the multi-ethnic
society like Zambia with 72 tribes.

<HEADLINE> 10th World Conference on Tobacco and Health Opens in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said smoking control work should be promoted as part of China's
efforts to improve health levels and keep pace with the country's
economic development and social progress.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has adopted a number of laws and
regulations designed to promote smoking control efforts
disseminate related information to the general public," Jiang told
conferees attending the opening session of the international
anti-smoking conference which opened here in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The country has strictly banned smoking amongst minors and
students in primary and middle schools. He added that adult
smokers are being persuaded to quit the habit and live a healthy
life.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, "China will continue to engage in concerted
efforts with other countries to improve the health of the people."
</P>
<P>
"I hope the World Health Organization (WHO) will make further
contributions to the global smoking control drive," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session, WHO director general hiroshi
Nakajima said that tobacco is not only a big health problem but
also the cause for a loss of several billion US dollars in the
world each year.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, he added, so many societies in the world still
regard the tobacco consumption as acceptable social behavior.
He said that WHO will possibly work out the framework for
an interantional tobacco control convention after the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The conference is the first of its kind held in China, a
country which is home to 320 million smokers and a giant tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,800 delegates from China and 103 other countries and
regions attended the opening session held in the Great Hall of
the People.
</P>
<P>
China's Health Minister Chen Minzhang and the Soong Ching Ling
Foundation were awarded WHO Tobacco or Health medals for their
remarkable achievements in fighting for a smoke-free society.
</P>
<P>
WHO Director General Hiroshi Nakajima and officials from WHO,
Unicef and various other international organizations also attended
the conference.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the opening session, the Chinese president met with
and had a picture taken with some conferees
</P>
<P>
The five-day conference, with the theme "Tobacco: The Growing
Epidemic," will focus on the tobacco industry's expansion into
developing countries, as well as smoking control, new methods to
help people quit smoking, passive smoking, and the effects of
tobacco on women and young people.
</P>
<P>
A total of 95 symposiums and an exhibition will be held in the
Beijing International Conference Center, the main venue of the
conference.

<HEADLINE> Blair, Adams to Meet on Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
is preparing to meet Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams within the next
few weeks in a historic move which will set the seal on Sinn
Fein's involvement in full-scale negotiations on the future of
Northern Ireland, The Sunday Telegraph reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the highly sensitive first meeting
between a British Prime Minister and Sinn Fein's president is seen
by the Government as the inevitable consequence of the decision,
to be announced this week, to allow Adams and colleagues to join
all-party talks next month.
</P>
<P>
Marjorie Mowlam, secretary of state for Northern Ireland, will
complete her assessment within the next few days of whether the
Irish Republican Army (IRA) ceasefire declared on July 19 is
"genuine in word and deed."
</P>
<P>
Although she insisted last night that she would not take a
formal decision until she has been briefed this week by the Army
and other security forces, there is no doubt in Northern Ireland
or elsewhere that the IRA has met the Government's six-week test.
</P>
<P>
Blair will not meet Adams until after Sinn Fein has joined the
formal talks, due to begin on September 15, and publicly signed up
to the six "Mitchell principles" on the decommissioning of
terrorist weapons, likely to come on the same day.
</P>
<P>
But the Government has made clear that a meeting is likely to
follow within weeks. In a letter last month to Martin McGuinness,
Sinn Fein's chief negotiator, Ms Mowlam said meetings with Mr
Blair "would be dealt with on the same basis as for other
participants" once Sinn Fein had joined negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Mr Blair has met the leaders of other Northern Ireland parties
regularly in Downing Street, and has never refused a request to do
so. A Northern Ireland Office insider said yesterday: "The Prime
Minister has never not been in the business of meeting party
leaders." A senior minister said: "A meeting with Gerry Adams
will happen at some point."

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Condemns Israeli Attacks Against Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today strongly
condemned Israel for its latest bombardment against Lebanese
targets and urged the international community to take immediate
measures to stop the military operations on civilians and revive
the deadlocked Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs Abdul Aziz
Al-Dakhil made the condemnation after a weekly cabinet meeting
here.
</P>
<P>
"The cabinet is following up with concern the continuous
Israeli barbaric attacks against Lebanon and the random shelling
targeting civilian areas," said Al-Dakhil.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes fired at least six air-to-surface missiles at
the position of Hezbollah guerrillas in the western sector of the
border enclave Saturday in south Lebanon as part of a series of
attacks last week on targets in areas of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Nine civilians were reportedly killed and 41 wounded in south
Lebanon's provincial capital Saida when the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army militia opened heavy artillery fire against the city
last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Israel have been exchanging accusations over
violation of the April 1996 cease-fire agreement which banned
both sides from targeting civilians or launching attacks from
civilian areas.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Tension Grips South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Information Minister
Bassem Al-Sabaa said today tension and apprehension were seizing
the towns and villages in south Lebanon due to Israeli policies.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egyptian Voice of Arabs radio, he said
that there was an Israeli plan aimed at driving a wedge between
the resistance forces and the Lebanese people and dragging
Lebanon back to internal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"Israel will never have fulfilled its objectives because Lebanon
has past the stage of being lured into domestic strifes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops killed three Hezbollah (Party of God) guerrillas
in south Lebanon Saturday in fierce clashes that included air
raids and artillery exchange.
</P>
<P>
The violence capped the worst week in south Lebanon's
cross-border violence since a cease-fire understanding ended a
17-day Israeli blitz on Lebanon in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
Sabaa referred to the April understanding between Israel and
Lebanon as an "accepted mechanism" to protect civilians in the
south.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese minister lashed out at the Israeli government of
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and accused it of being the
cause behind the tension in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon believes that peace to be reached should be based on
the implementation by Israel of U.N. Security Council resolution
425, which demands the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern
Lebanon..." he said.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 Israeli troops have held a border occupation in a
self-declared "security zone" in south Lebanon since 1985, in
defiance of U.N. resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Stresses Ties With Belarus Despite Recent Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said today that his country will strengthen ties with
Belarus despite a recent row over the detainment of Russian
journalists there.
</P>
<P>
"We shall do everything to strengthen our ties with Belarus.
They are too precious, too important for us all," Chernomyrdin was
quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying while visiting the
Moscow International Air Show.
</P>
<P>
Six journalists from Russia's ORT television were detained
recently in Belarus after filming on the Belarussian-Lithuanian
border.
</P>
<P>
Three Russian journalists were released this week but three
other journalists, who are Belarussian citizens, remain in jail
pending trial for allegedly trying to violate the Belarussian
border.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax also quoted a senior official in the Kremlin as
saying that Russian President Boris Yeltsin had demanded on
Saturday that the three Belarussian journalists also be freed.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin criticized Belarus for detaining the journalists,
saying such moves were "unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
But the Russian premier said a union treaty signed this year by
the two former Soviet republics was much more important.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Belarus signed a treaty in May calling for closer
economic, political and military ties but both nations retain full
sovereignty and the treaty has had little practical effect.
</P>
<P>
Belarus, sandwiched among Russia, Ukraine and Poland, has
enjoyed close bond with Russia. Most of the 10 million
Belarussians hope that the union with some 150 million Russians
could end their country's economic difficulty.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's share in world
exports has remained unchanged at 0.18 percent during the five
year period of 1991-1995 mainly because of decline in exports of
manufactured goods, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of the country's exports during this period was
only 2.1 percent as the exports increased from 6.4 billion U.S.
dollars in 1991 to 8.1 billion in 1995, the statistics said.
</P>

The decline is observed in exports from the major sectors
including textile and clothing, carpets and carpeting, leather and

<HEADLINE> Zambian Police Denies Firing at Ex-president </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Zambian police today denied that
the police fired at ex-president Kenneth David Kaunda who tried
to address an opposition rally Saturday in central town of Kabwe,
the Zambia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Standwell Lungu also denied that the police
fired bullets at Kaunda's supporters to disrupt the rally.
</P>
<P>
The police only used " tear gas cannisters" to disperse the
people, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said that Kaunda, President of the United
National Independence Party (UNIP), and another oppisition leader
Roger Chongwe were shot by police while they were driving away
from a UNIP's local headquaters after being prevented from
addressing the rally.
</P>
<P>
However, the Zambia News Agency said that Kaunda was last
night hospitalized at Kabwe General Hospital, while Chongwe went
under an emergency operationn to remove a bullet from the neck.
</P>
<P>
Several other senior UNIP officials were also injured in the
confusion and admitted to the hospital, said sources close to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Both Kaunda and Chongwe were reported to be out of danger and
that they were discharged and driven to Lusaka during the early
hours of this morning.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today, Deputy Minister Alfred Chambeshi
of Central Province, of which Kabwe is the capital, regretted the
use of live ammunition by police in an attempt to disperse the
opposition rally while defending the police action.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the situation in Kabwe has returned to
normal with street vendors going about with their business
activities. However, a few armed policemen are deployed in
strategic places in the city.

<HEADLINE> Schumacher Wins Belgian Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Rainmaster Michael Schumacher
of Germany lived up to his reputation today by winning the
Formula-One grand prix at the rain-lashed Spa-Francorchamps
circuit.
</P>
<P>
It was the German's third consecutive win in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Starting from the third position on the grid behind Jacques
Villeneuve of Canada and Jean Alesi of France, Schumacher clocked
an accumulated winning time of one hour 33 minutes 46.717 seconds
for the 44-lap, 306.577-kilometer circuit, averaging 196.149
kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher once built up a leading gap of more than 60 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The win added a full 10 points to Schumacher's tally which
increased to 66 points for this year's world championship while
his team Ferrari also got 10 points to 54 points on the team
standings.
</P>
<P>
Giancarlo Fisichella from Italy and Mika Hakkinen of Finland,
fourth and fifth out of the starting grid, held on to finish
runner-up and third out of a field of 22 starters.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen was reinstated in the fifth spot on the grid after his
team McLaren appealed against a decision to put him to the back of
the grid for alleged fuel irregularities.
</P>
<P>
The Finn's team said that the fuel was unchanged since the
British grand prix where samples of the fuel were tested and found
to be legal.
</P>
<P>
Villeneuve, who grabbed the pole position after winning
Saturday's qualifying round with a lap time of 1:49.450, gave up
the leader's position after three laps of race.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian driver later battled back from 14th place to
finish sixth.
</P>
<P>
Damon Hill of Britain, who won the Belgian stop of the grand
prix circuit back-to-back in 1993 and 1994, retired on the last
lap.
</P>
<P>
David Coulthard also from Britain, ninth starter on the grid,
spun off the track on the 21st lap.
</P>
<P>
The Spa-Francorchamps circuit once more proved to be frickle as
drivers had begun lining up on the grid for the start when the
circuit was hit by a heavy downpour.
</P>
<P>
Mechanics had already begun taking wet-weather tyres back to
pits when they were forced to ferry them back.
</P>
<P>
Organizers had no options but to start the race with the safety
car before drivers were finally let go after three laps.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Offshore Oil Field in Bohai Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Shengli Oilfield, China's
second largest, has recorded a major breakthrough in oil
exploration by developing the Chengdao Oilfield in the Bohai Sea
off the nation's east coast.
</P>
<P>
The new oilfield, which has an annual output of 1.05 million
tons and is the largest offshore oil field in the Bohai Bay, offer
massive production potential.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from the China National Petroleum Corp.
(CNPC), exploration of the offshore oilfield was difficult due to
its complicated geological structure. Shengli has developed
Chengdao by applying a vast array of new technology for onshore
development, including 3-D seismic surveys and oil reserve
tracking technology.
</P>
<P>
The Bohai area has an respective annual oil and gas outputs of
2.12 million tons and 367 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Oil officials expect even greater progress this year in oil and
gas exploration in the Bohai area, with forecasts calling for
proven oil and gas reserves forecast to hit 60 million tons and 10
billion cu. m. respectively.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Exports 13.5 Million Barrels of Oil in 8 Days  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraq exported more than 13.5
million barrels of crude over the past eight days under its
renewed oi-for-food deal with the United Nations, Iraqi newspaper
Al-Qadissiya said today.
</P>
<P>
This is roughly in keeping with the country's projected oil
export capacity of 1.8 million barrels a day. Iraq has to speed up
crude export to fit into a cut-off period ending December 6.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rasheed promised that all
contracts concluded with foreign companies can be implemented
before the deadline of the second stage of the deal. By August 19
the U.N. had given green light to 22 contracts for the sale of a
total of 90.2 million barrels of Iraqi crude.
</P>
<P>
Iraq began a second six-month period of oil sales in mid-August
after a delay of more than two months while a distribution plan
for humanitarian goods was drawn up with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Oil tankers are continuing to head for the Turkish port of
Ceyhan and Iraq's Gulf port of Al-Bakr where Iraqi oil is to be
loaded.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said there is no obstacles to loading the
anchoring tankers with the amounts of oil contracted with world
companies.
</P>
<P>
In the first stage of the oil-for-food deal, Iraq managed to sell
more than 120 million barrels of its crude oil. An additional
140 million dollars of crude was also exported to purchase spare
parts for the Iraq-Turkey pipeline.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. Security Council Resolution 986, Iraq is
permitted to sell 2 billion dollars of oil over six months to
purchase humanitarian goods as well as paying reparations and the
cost of the U.N. operations in the country.
</P>
<P>
During the second stage, the Iraq-Turkey pipeline will export
61.3 million barrels of the oil, while its Gulf port will export
the remainder.

<HEADLINE> Clan Fighting Kills 7 Persons in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 24 (Xinhua) -- At least seven people were
killed and eight others wounded on Saturday when heavy fighting
erupted between rival clan militiamen at Berhano village, 90 km
south of the port town of Kismaio.
</P>
<P>
The fighting which began two days ago escalated Saturday when
Marehan clan militiamen attacked their rival clan, Majerten, from
the south of Kismaio, 500 km south of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from the field VHF radios today, the
Majerten militiamen who dominate the town of Kismaio have fought
bitterly with those of the Marehan before pushing them back to
Berhano village.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the renewed fighting is not yet known, however
the reports attributed the attack of the Marehans to a
revenge-taking measure taken by the clansmen of Marehan after two
World Concern employees were killed inside Kismaio by Majerten
gunmen four days ago.
</P>
<P>
The hostility between the two clans is now at its highest peak
since they started fighting for control of Kismaio early this
year. At least 60 people have died and more than a hundred others
were wounded so far.
</P>
<P>
There have been several peace initiatives launched by elders
from both sides and other mediatory clans in the region, but none
was fruitful as each side remained stuck on its version for their
right to control the town.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Contributes to Increasing Worldwide Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Recent estimates indicate that
10 million people will die from tobacco-related diseases by the
year 2025 if current smoking patterns persist, according to
information released during the 10th World Conference on Tobacco
and Health which opened today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The total number of global deaths from tobacco will include
three million people in developed countries and seven million
people in developing countries, according to Richard Peto, a
professor from Oxford University.
</P>
<P>
Peto said that three million people throughout the world die
from smoking each year, with the number of deaths in developing
countries amounting for some 33 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Predictions for major increases in annual tobacco-related deaths
in developing countries are based partly on rapidly
growing cigarette sales in related countries, said Peto.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out China, the largest producer and consumer of
tobacco, will record between two and three million people
smoking-related deaths by the year 2025, a dramatic rise on the
half million annual deaths at present.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "prolonged smoking may eventually present the same
level of hazard in developed countries, where about half of
regular smokers die from diseases directly related to the habit."
</P>
<P>
Another report revealed that the mortality rate for female
smokers is developed countries, with the United States recording
the highest rate. The smoking mortality rate for in middle and
eastern Europe is also amongs the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Quitting smoking at the earliest possible date may help those
who have not as yet developed serious smoking-related diseases
avoid the risk of death from tobacco, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Exports 13.5 Million Barrels of Oil in 8 Days  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraq exported more than 13.5
million barrels of crude over the past eight days under its
renewed oi-for-food deal with the United Nations, Iraqi newspaper
Al-Qadissiya said today.
</P>
<P>
This is roughly in keeping with the country's projected oil
export capacity of 1.8 million barrels a day. Iraq has to speed up
crude export to fit into a cut-off period ending December 6.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rasheed promised that all
contracts concluded with foreign companies can be implemented
before the deadline of the second stage of the deal. By August 19
the U.N. had given green light to 22 contracts for the sale of a
total of 90.2 million barrels of Iraqi crude.
</P>
<P>
Iraq began a second six-month period of oil sales in mid-August
after a delay of more than two months while a distribution plan
for humanitarian goods was drawn up with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Oil tankers are continuing to head for the Turkish port of
Ceyhan and Iraq's Gulf port of Al-Bakr where Iraqi oil is to be
loaded.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said there is no obstacles to loading the
anchoring tankers with the amounts of oil contracted with world
companies.
</P>
<P>
In the first stage of the oil-for-food deal, Iraq managed to sell
more than 120 million barrels of its crude oil. An additional
140 million dollars of crude was also exported to purchase spare
parts for the Iraq-Turkey pipeline.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. Security Council Resolution 986, Iraq is
permitted to sell 2 billion dollars of oil over six months to
purchase humanitarian goods as well as paying reparations and the
cost of the U.N. operations in the country.
</P>
<P>
During the second stage, the Iraq-Turkey pipeline will export
61.3 million barrels of the oil, while its Gulf port will export
the remainder.

<HEADLINE> 700,000 Chinese To Die From Smoking-Related Diseases This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A professor from the Chinese
Academy of Preventive Medicine predicts that some 700,000 Chinese
people, including 600,000 men, will die from smoking-related
diseases this year.
</P>
<P>
During an address at today's opening meeting of the 10th World
Conference on Tobacco and Health in Beijing, Professor Niu Shiru
said that a recent national perspective study on mortality
indicated that smoking-related diseases will account for about 12
percent of the deaths of five million Chinese male adults during
1997.
</P>
<P>
Niu added that smoking-related diseases will contribute to the
deaths of over 100,000 Chinese women in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The study, which surveyed over 250,000 Chinese male adults,
showed that smokers face a much greater risk of cancer, and
respiratory system and cardio-vascular diseases than nonsmokers.
</P>
<P>
Cigarette consumption in China has jumped by 30 percent in the
past 20 years, and the country is currently the world's major
producer and consumer of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
Another survey released at the conference revealed that about
63 percent of Chinese male adults and four percent of Chinese
women smoke. Male and female smokers consume an average of 15 and
11 cigarettes daily.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that middle-aged and young smokers began
smoking at 20 year of age, and that the smoking rate for people
between 15-25 is growing more rapidly than for all other age
groups.
</P>
<P>
Conferees pointed out that the smoking rate for Chinese men is
much higher than rate for women, but that the latter group
nonetheless faces considerable hazards from smoking.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the rising number of young smokers and younger
starting age of smokers may greatly harm the nation's overall
health.

SEOUL, August 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will channel 10
million U.S. dollars worth of food, medicine and farming
implements to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK),
the Ministry of National Unification announced over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the aid package, to be delivered through the
U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), will mainly benefit children in
DPRK.
</P>
<P>
It said the decision was made under the government's policy of
continued humanitarian assistance to the flood-and-drought
attacked DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to send farming equipment, though small in scope,
can be construed as our government's proclamation of a more active
policy to help the North (DPRK)," said Lee Jong-yul, director
general of ministry's Humanitarian Affairs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
International relief workers estimate that about 800,000 tons
of food are needed in the DPRK before their October harvest.
</P>
<P>
The latest announcement of aid came in the wake of last

<HEADLINE> Malaysia To Voice Stand in Efforts to Curb Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will voice its
stand in efforts to curb currency manipulations at the
Commonwealth Finance Ministers meeting in Mauritius next month,
its Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said today.
</P>
<P>
"We are firm in our stand to ensure there are joint efforts to
fight rogue speculators who meddle with international currencies,"
Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said in Pulau Pinang,
according to official media reports here.
</P>
<P>
Anwar expressed his confidence that due consideration will be
given to discuss the issue as it had "degraded the currencies of
many countries".
</P>
<P>
A series of discussions have been and will be held with the
finance ministers of the affected countries to reach a consensus
on the joint efforts to fight the speculators including U.S.
billionaire financier George Soros who allegedly had destabilized
the financial system in this region and that of several other
countries in the world, Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Central Bank of Malaysia had started discussions on
the issue with the central banks of ASEAN member countries.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday, I discussed the matter with Chinese Prime Minister
Li Peng and tonight I will raise the issue with the finance
minister of Indonesia," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Anwar met the Chinese premier in Pulau Pinang, who left for
Singapore this morning following a four-day official visit in
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian leader said issues on currency manipulations are
also expected to be discussed at the ASEAN-Europe finance
ministers meeting in Bangkok and the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund annual meeting next month.
</P>
<P>
A joint strategy needs to be adopted to tackle the issue, he
stressed, adding that in fact, Malaysia had suggested several
proposals to certain countries for implementation to check
currency speculations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, upon returning to Kuala Lumpur today, Anwar said he
regretted with the allegations that his government was
over-reacting to the currency manipulation issue.
</P>
<P>
He said many countries including developed nations disagreed
with the manner in which Soros speculated on currencies but they
are not brave to voice out.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, some of the countries have asked Malaysia to speak
up. We are brave to voice our views as we are not dependent on
anybody or owe major lenders to develop the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that although Malaysia enjoyed a vibrant economy in the
past eight years, unpopular things sometimes do crop up.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken appropriate steps including stepping
up exports, minimizing imports and create various activities to
reduce the outflow of funds, he said.

contact Johnson's manager Michelone and ask him to persude Johnson to
compete in the festival on the closing day of the Universiade.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Called On to Cooperate with Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State General
Sani Abacha has urged Nigerians to put down confrontational
attitude and cooperate with the government in order to evolve an
enduring political culture.
</P>
<P>
"We can never make it if we continue to dissipate energy in
unnecessary confrontation," Abacha said in the capital Abuja on
Saturday, quoted by "Sunday Tribune" today.
</P>
<P>
"What we require in the days is cooperation and not
confrontation," Abacha told a funding raising ceremony of the
Alumni Association of National Institute of Policy and Strategic
Studies.
</P>
<P>
According to the head of state, the country has entered a
crucial stage of the military regime's transition to civil rule
program, both the government and Nigerians "are faced with
greater challenges of peace and stability, nation building,
democracy and development."
</P>
<P>
The military is scheduled to hand over power to an elected
civilian government in October next year, according to the
transition program of the Abacha administration.
</P>
<P>
With a little more than one year to go, there are a lot for
the administration to cope with in a view to creating an
environment favorable for a peaceful handover, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The government has over the past few years gained some
progress in macro-economic control, with foreign reserves on the
rise and inflation rate on the decline.
</P>
<P>
Political parties have been registered and are busy consulting
with the transition agencies over the democratization process.
</P>
<P>
The administration has also made efforts in the diplomatic
front, making new friends in the east while trying to improving
relations with its traditional partners in the west.
</P>
<P>
In west Africa, Nigeria's contribution to the sub-regional
efforts in ending the bloody civil war in Liberia has won the
country a good reputation and reinforced its leading role in the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The urgent need of the Abacha administration at present is to
strive to convince Nigerians, and the international community as
well, of its sincere readiness to hand over to civil rule.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Capital Flows to Pudong (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Major international companies
are pouring investments into the New Pudong Area which only a few
years ago was nothing more than forgotten land in the vast
metropolis of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government opened Pudong to overseas capital in
1990, and investors from over 60 foreign countries and regions
have since invested a total of 23.07 billion US dollars in the
area.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-two of the top 500 international companies have
invested in Pudong, an area covering 350 sq.km., with a number of
international giants which have moved their headquarters or
regional headquarters into Pudong.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign businessmen feel that Pudong has the greatest
potential of all of the nation's open areas and will play a role
as a bridge between the Chinese and world economies.
</P>
<P>
According to local government sources, the municipal government
of Shanghai has invested over 30 billion yuan for infrastructure
construction in Pudong in order to offer China's best investment
environment. Simple procedures make it possible for companies to
complete registration formalities in no more than 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The central government has granted Pudong a series of
preferential policies, especially in terms of foreign capital and
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Local officials from the Pudong New Area Administrative
Committee say that Pudong has entered a new stage which involves
establishing industrial zones in different sections, rather than
simply building infrastructure.

Four functional zones have taken shape in Pudong -- the
Lujiazui Financial Trade Zone, the Jinqiao Export Processing Zone,
the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone, and the Zhangjiang Science Park.
</P>
<P>
The fact that a dozen foreign banks have received approval to
be engaged in RMB yuan business on a trial basis is seen as a
major breakthrough in the opening-up process of the country's
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
A number of hi-tech projects have been established in the
Jinqiao and Zhangjiang zones, with Waigaoqiao emerging as a modern
foreign trade port which integrates trade with shipping.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, Pudong will enter a new round of
investment and construction over the next few years, with some 100
billion yuan to be spent on the construction of a new
international airport, subways, new deep-water ports and
information networks.
</P>
<P>
Local experts note that Pudong will continue to improve its
infrastructure. They predict that the area will attract even more
overseas funds over the next few years.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Reserve 17 Percent of Land for Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government is to
reserve 17 percent of the land in the country as forest estates,
reported local daily "The Monitor" today.
</P>
<P>
Haguma Isoke, Minister of State for Natural Resources, was
quoted as announcing that " 50 percent of the percent has been
designated for production forestry and 20 percent as strict
nature reserves while the rest will remain as buffer zone where
limited production forestry will be achieved."
</P>
<P>
He added that although the government has continuously been
concerned about the state of the natural forests, destruction has
only escalated.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that 33 percent of tropical forests in
Uganda have been destroyed through agriculture, uncontrolled
human settlement and bad tree harvests.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is losing forest cover at an alarming rate. Statistics
shows that the country's forest cover has dwindled from 14
percent of its total land in 1967 to seven percent at present.
</P>
<P>
To reserve 17 percent of land for forests is part of draft
national nature conservation master plan whose work started in
1987, the report revealed.

<HEADLINE> Memorial Pavilion Built to Mark HK's Return to Motherland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- A memorial pavilion to mark
the return of Hong Kong to the motherland on July 1, 1997 was
unveiled here today.
</P>
<P>
Situated on Lion Rock Hill in Kowloon, the hexagonal pavilion
commands a good view of the Hong Kong Island, the Kowloon
Peninsula and the Victoria Harbor, the world busiest seaport.
</P>
<P>
A non-government organization in Kowloon raised nearly 700,000
HK dollars (about 90,000 US dollars) to build the pavilion, hoping
that later generations will always bear in mind the historic
moment, when China resumed its exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
A horizontal board hung inside the pavilion features
inscription of Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR), reading "Hong Kong
Reunification Memorial Pavilion".
</P>
<P>
It took a couple of months to complete the construction,
according to the organization, which was formed by various sectors
in Kowloon to celebrate the return of Hong Kong to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
For hikers, this traditional Chinese architecture provides a
shelter from the tropical rain and sunshine.

<HEADLINE> S. African Schools Face Textbook Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cutbacks, delays and other problems are also causing chaos in
the country's publishing industry, which depends on textbooks for
half its volume of work and many are floundering financially, the
report quoted informed sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last year's spending on textbooks in South Africa was slashed
by 42 percent to around 520 million Rand (111 million U.S.
Dollars) from 895 million Rand (190 million U.S.Dollars) in
1995/96, despite the fact that only 49 percent of schools are
currently adequately provided with textbooks.
</P>
<P>
Publishers still have no idea how much provinces will spend on
books in the current financial year. But it is likely that cuts
to provincial budget allocations will substantially reduce
textbook spending once again, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the problem, newly-elected Chairman of the South
African Publishers' Assoiciation Kate Mccallum said: "We are
seriously concerned about the supply of textbooks to schools in
1998."

<HEADLINE> Germany Lags Behind in Internet Race: German HP Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Germans have tend to be too
suspicious of the commercial development of the Internet computer
network, thus falling far behind in its commercial use, the German
subsidiary of the U.S. computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) said
today.
</P>
<P>
While German companies were generally interested in the
potential of the Internet as a business tool, they've been
relatively slow to adopt it, said Joerg Menno Harms, head of the
HP's German subsidiary, in an interview with the German news
agency DPA.
</P>
<P>
Currently in Europe, Britain and the Scandinavian countries
have the highest rate of Internet use per capita, said Harms,
adding that this will probably not change within the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
But European countries in general are still lagging far behind
in the use of Internet in comparison with the United States, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
According to his estimates, European commerical transactions
over the Internet will reach about 7 billion U.S. dollars annually
by the year of 2000. While two thirds of that volume would come
from Britain and Scandinavia, Germany will have a relatively
modest share of about 10 percent, he predicted.

BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- All the 2,048 deputies to the
15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have
been elected through elections held in 36 election units across
the country.
</P>

The election unites included departments of the CPC Central
Committee, departments of the central government, the All-China
Federation of Taiwan Compatriots, the People's Liberation Army and

</P>
<P>
The deputies were elected at Party deputy meetings or Party

</P>
<P>
The 6th Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee held in
October 1996 adopted the decision to convene the 15th National
Congress of the CPC in Beijing in the second half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
In November 1996, the CPC Central Committee issued a circular
on the election of the deputies to the 15th National Congress of
the CPC.
</P>
<P>
The circular spelled out specific requirements for the division
of election units, the conditions for the deputies, the
composition of the deputies, the procedures for the election of
the deputies and the allocation of the number of the deputies.
</P>
<P>
Party organizations at all levels paid close attention to the
election. In the course of discussing, nominating and electing the
deputies, the principle of democratic centralism was implemented

that more than 95 percent of grass-roots Party organizations
participated in recommending the candidates, involving 85
percent of Party members.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the deputies' quality, organization departments of
Party committees at all levels made careful examinations of
candidates' political performance, moral standards, work
performance, and self-discipline and honesty. All election units
were required to have the number of candidates at least ten
percent more than that of the actual deputies elected.
</P>
<P>
The deputies to the 15th National Congress of the CPC represent
more than 58 million members of the whole Party. Of the deputies,
leading officials account for 75.9 percent; model workers,
advanced workers, outstanding experts, and heros from all walks of
life, 24.1 percent; women, 16.8 percent; people of minority ethnic
groups, 10.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 63.5 percent of the deputies are under the age of 55,
and 83.5 percent have a college education.
</P>
<P>
The deputies who joined the Party after the founding of New
China in 1949 constitute the overwhelming majority.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Expand Offset Program to Civil Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is to expand its
Offset program to oblige foreign civil contractors, like their
military counterparts, to reinvest in the country or its overseas
projects.
</P>
<P>
According to Kuwaiti Finance Minister Nasser Al-Roudhan today,
a plan to bring civil supplies contract under the Offset program
is now under consideration.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait started its Offset program in 1992 under a Cabinet
decision stipulating that foreign companies which sign contracts
with the Kuwaiti government in the military field worth 3.3
million U.S. dollars or above are obliged to reinvest an
equivalent up to 30 percent of the contractual value.
</P>
<P>
The amounts should be invested either in the country or in its
abroad projects to contribute to the country's economy, according
to the program.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of the base for implementing the Offset program
will obviously bring more benefit to the country, but it's too
early to predict if this would affect the enthusiasm of foreign
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti minister told local daily Arab Times in an
interview published today that a foreign company which he did not
name and recently had a supplies contract with the Kuwaiti
Ministry of Electricity and Water was obliged to join the program.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Al-Roudhan said that Kuwait has attained potential
projects valued at 1.5 billion dollars which have to be
implemented by companies under the program.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that not all the obligations have been met so
far, and urged foreign companies falling to abide by the
conditions set by the program even if they do not have any
immediate projects for implementation.
</P>
<P>
He said "some penalties are imposed in respect of companies
which failed to comply with the specified time schedule stipulated
to come up with various projects to enable them to fulfill their
obligations."

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Phones Albright to Complain About PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu telephoned U.S. States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright overnight to complain about the Palestinian
National Authority's (PNA) reluctance on fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports today, Netanyahu said during the
phone conversation that PNA President Yasser Arafat was not
honoring the agreements reached with U.S. special peace envoy
Dennis Ross earlier this month by failing to carry out the
commitment to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's recent meetings with leaders of Palestinian
opposition groups, including the Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas) and Islamic Jihad, would not contribute to the peace
process, Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
Peace negotiation between Israel and the Palestinians have been
frozen since March when Israel began building the controversial
Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem in spite of strong warnings
from the PNA and outcry in the world.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, on the other hand, also called up Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein to warn that the peace
process was in danger unless there was a real change in Arafat's
stance toward Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu demanded that Arafat crack down on the militant
Islamic groups and their support infrastructure, by rounding up
extremist activists, disarming them and cutting off their funding.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements reached during Ross' visit, the PNA
promised to resume security cooperation with Israel and fight
terrorism to pave the way for the maiden visit to the region by
Albright late August or early September.
</P>
<P>
But the PNA has repeatedly urged in vain Israel to lift its
sanctions imposed after the July 30 Jerusalem market bombings,
which include total closure of Palestinian-controlled areas, ban on
Palestinian workers from entering Israel and freeze of the tax
revenues due to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
In a gesture to reward the partial security cooperation from
Palestinian police in the bombing investigation and the arrest of
three Palestinian murderers of an Israeli taxi driver, Israeli
government released last week only one-third of a total 14 million
dollars in tax revenues collected by the Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his anger and despair about "Israeli arrogance,"
Arafat started a two-day dialogue last Wednesday in Gaza and
Ramallah with Palestinian opposition groups within the framework
of "national unity forum."
</P>
<P>
Israel strongly denounced Arafat for trying to appease and
placate the militant groups in an attempt to exert pressure on
Israel, thus breaching the agreements reached during Ross'
visit.

<HEADLINE> Ceasefire Monitoring Committee Condemns Shelling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The ceasefire monitoring
committee has reached a conclusion that condemns Israel of
violating the ceasefire understanding and hurting civilians,
Lebanese radio reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
After four consecutive days of heated discussion, the
committee, which convened on Wednesday, ended its marathon
session in Naqoura on the Lebanese-Israeli border at 8:30 p.m.
(17:30 GMT) Saturday night, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
In its findings, the committee asked Israel to take
responsibility for Monday's shelling of Lebanese southern city of
Saida, which killed 9 civilians and wounded nearly 40 others.
</P>
<P>
Israel defended during the meeting that the attack was
carried out by its militia ally, the South Lebanese Army(SLA),
without knowledge of Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
However, Lebanon insisted that the SLA's operation was under
the Israeli permission and instruction.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the committee accused Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, of firing Katyusha rockets at northern
Israel and the asked Lebanese government to curb this kind of
action in the future.
</P>
<P>
The committee, made up of delegates from the U.S., France,
Israel, Syria and Lebanon and established after the Israeli
16-day blitz of Lebanon in April last year, discussed 10
complaints of ceasefire violations presented by Lebanon and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
In the past five days of violence in south Lebanon, some 12
people were killed, of them, at least 10 are Lebanese
civilians.

<HEADLINE> India May See Record Foodgrain Production: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The foodgrain production in
India this year is likely to cross a record mark of 200 million
tons, Agriculture Minister Chaturanan Mishra said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to Press Trust of India, Mishra said that the
production could even further go up if more state funds were
allocated for the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
This year, barring certain areas in Himachal Pradesh and Bihar,
which were hit by cloudburst, the country on the whole had a good
rainfall, he said.
</P>
<P>
Taking this into account, the minister expressed hope that the
production would cross the 200 million ton mark.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that India had achieved a record foodgrain
production of 198.17 million tons last year despite all constrains
such as lack of sufficient funds.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Planning Commission to allocate more funds to the
agricultural sector for irrigation, fertilizer and seeds.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Boom Expected in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will earn about 19
billion Shillings (about 300 million Dollars) through coffee sale
this year due to high quality and favorable prices in the world
markets, the Kenya Times newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Roughly 80,000 tons of coffee is expected to be sold at the
end of 1996/97 financial year which ends on September 31, the
report quoted Peter Michoru, Director of the Coffee Research
Foundation of Kenya, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kenya sold 90,000 tons of coffee but only collected 16 billion
Shillings (about 260 million Dollars) from the sale in the
previous financial year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The fall in coffee yield this year is caused by severe drought
which hit most parts of the country early this year, said
Michoru.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenyan coffee has been regarded as one of the best
quality in the world market, enabling the eastern African country
to earn a lot of money, he added.

A Mercedes spokesman said the race stewards had agreed that

position.

DAR ES SALAAM, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Burundi peace talks
will open on Monday though it was said to be cancelled after the
Burundian government demanded for a postponement, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The talks will start as originally scheduled in the northern
Tanzanian Town of Arusha but without the participation of the
Burundi government team, said the report, quoting an aide of
former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere who is the
international facilitator on Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the organizers said that they had reversed a
decision on Friday to cancel the talks after they realized it was
too late to recall some delegations already heading for the
venue.
</P>
<P>
The aide of Nyerere said, "He (Nyerere) just regrets the
government delegation of Burundi will not be attending (the
talks)."
</P>
<P>
The talks were planned to bring together the government and
the main Hutu rebel group the National Council for the Defense of
Democracy for the first time in a public forum.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi government said earlier on Saturday it only wanted
the peace talks postponed for two weeks or less and was trying to
contact Nyerere to set a new date for the talks. The Burundi
government's request was said on the grounds that successful
talks were unlikely.
</P>
<P>
Observers, however, are of the view that the absence of a
Burundi government delegation means little progress could be made
to end the civil war and the political crisis in Burundi.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why IMF Aid Fails to Prop Up Baht? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Thai currency of baht
continued to weaken against the U.S. dollar despite the
International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s approval of a standby credit
of 3.9 billion U.S. dollars for Thailand last Wednesday. The baht
was once sold at more than 34 baht to the dollar on Thursday,
hitting a record low.
</P>
<P>
The IMF aid is part of international rescue package totaling
more than 16 billion dollars to help Thailand to revive its ailing
economy and reinforce its foreign exchange reserves to stabilize
the country shaky financial sector.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF assistance seemed too small to immediately
bring about a good news to the baht as the country has a worse
news heard.
</P>
<P>
The Thai central bank Wednesday disclosed for the first time
that Thailand had commitments totaling 23.4 billion dollars in
outstanding currency forward obligations over the next 12 months,
which may suggest that the country's foreign reserves had been
significantly drained during its mid-May battle in defending the
baht.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures published earlier by the central bank,
Thailand's foreign reserves stood at above 37 billion dollars
before May, but the figure dropped to 32.4 billion dollars at the
end of June.
</P>
<P>
Analysts previously believed that Thailand only spent a maximum
of 5 billion dollars in its counter-attacks against speculations
on the baht in mid-May this year.
</P>
<P>
Yet the latest disclosure of Thailand's outstanding currency
debts sent a surprise to the financial markets, fueling the bath
down to the record low recently.
</P>
<P>
The Thai central bank Wednesday said in a letter of intent that
as of August 19, Thailand had currency forward obligations
totaling 23.4 billion dollars over the next 12 months. Of this
amount, 8.6 billion dollars was for onshore activities related to
domestic monetary operations and 14.8 billion dollars was for
offshore activities.
</P>
<P>
Onshore activities are instruments of domestic liquidity
management, which have since last year become part of the normal
conduct of monetary operations. The central bank undertakes daily
auctions of swap transactions with domestic financial institutions
as a way of providing baht liquidity.
</P>
<P>
This part of the operation is normally rolled over and will not
adversely affect Thailand's foreign reserves position, the central
bank said.
</P>
<P>
The offshore activities are interventions in defending the baht
against intensive speculative attacks, it explained.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding forward debts have been taken into account when
Thailand held consultations with the IMF on international rescue
aid, so Thailand set targets to maintain its foreign reserves at
the level of 23 billion dollars for 1997 and 25 billion dollars
for 1998, the central bank noted.
</P>
<P>
The huge outstanding forward obligations disclosed by the
central bank are triggering speculations on Thailand's real
foreign reserves position.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said that people could not believe that
Thailand's foreign reserves has dropped to 9 billion dollars
simply by deducting the forward debts from the June reserves
figure of 32.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding forward obligations will be delivered at a set
date in the future and some of them will be rolled over, they
added.
</P>
<P>
In an overall view, the huge outstanding forward debts are
hurting the market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the limited IMF aid currently help little in
restoring investors' confidence in Thailand's foreign reserves
position and the baht is expected to further weaken over the next
days or weeks.

<HEADLINE> Gujral Unlikely to Meet Clinton in New York: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral is unlikely to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton
during his New York visit next month, the Financial Express
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Gujral is scheduled to address the 52nd session of the United
Nations General assembly on September 30 and it may not be
possible to advance his visit to New York by a week to be there on
September 23, official sources was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports from Washington, Clinton has offered
to have bilateral discussion with Gujral during a day-long visit
to the UN on September 23.
</P>
<P>
The official line of thinking here was reported to be that the
Indian government has already established high-level contact with
the Clinton administration during the last few months.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for External Affairs Saleem Shervani recently
met U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at the ASEAN
regional forum meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, last month.
Albright has also promised to visit India later this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, new U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South
Asia, Karl Inderfurth, is scheduled to visit India next month,
which may be followed by a visit by Thomas Picketing, under
secretary of state for political affairs.
</P>
<P>
These visits will enable the two countries to exchange views on
a wide-range of issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
In view of these developments, it was felt there is no need for
Gujral to reschedule his New York visit for a half-an-hour meeting
with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
But one report carried by the Times of India today said that
efforts are still on to strike out an arrangement for a
Gujral-Clinton meet in New York.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Opposition Calls Strike Against Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's opposition political
parties called a dawn-to-dusk countrywide general strike today in
protest against the price hike of petrol and petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
The largest opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP),
Jamaat-e-Islami and the dissident faction of Jatiya (national)
Party enforced the strike separately, as the government rejected
their call to rescind its decision on the fuel price hike.
</P>
<P>
Due to enhanced prices on the international market and pressure
by donor agencies, the government on August 18 raised the prices
of all petroleum products, among which price of petrol has been
raised by over 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
The sudden price hike sparked off street protests by opposition
groups and transport unions. A partial transport strike is still
going on in capital Dhaka and other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The government, however, argued that the price-hike will not
affect the common people including farmers and transport sectors
as the increase in the prices of diesel and kerosene is nominal.
</P>
<P>
"The government has proved to be a complete failure in running
the state affairs and resolving people's problems in last 14
months," the BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia said in a statement
calling for the general strike.
</P>
<P>
In support of the today's strike, the BNP and its front
organizations Saturday held rallies and brought out various
processions in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The opposition activists allegedly set fire to some vehicles
and damaged some others during the procession.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a BNP statement issued Saturday night claimed at
least eight BNP workers were injured when the ruling party
activists swooped down their rally.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Government to Sever Relationship with Plavsic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb government
declared today that it will sever all relationship with President
Biljana Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
A government statement said the government decided not to
cooperate with the president from now on because she has refused
to abide by the ruling of the constitutional court and continued
to take actions that runs counter to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the government will consider all her orders and
actions illegal before she takes a fair attitude toward the
constitution and returns to the administrative seat of the Serb
Republic, the Tanjug news agency of Yugoslavia said.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic dissolved parliament on July 3. In response, the Serb
government sued her on July 7 at the constitutional court, which
ruled on August 15 that the President's decision was
anti-constitutional and therefore invalid.
</P>
<P>
With the conflicts inside the Serb leading body turning
white-hot, the U.S.-led Western countries expressed overt support
for Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
On August 20, Multinational Stablization Force (SFOR) and the
International Police Task Force (IPTF) forcibly occupied the
building of the police headquarters in Banja Luka following
Plavsic's meeting with the international High Representative to
Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, and U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard the night
before.
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Plavsic appointed Marko Pavic to replace Dragan
Kijac as the acting interior minister, prompting condemnation from
Prime Minister Gojko Klickovic, who said Plavsic's action was
anti-constitutional as the Serb constitution gives the president
no power to appoint ministers.
</P>
<P>
The General Staff of the Bosnian Serb army held an enlarged
meeting late Friday evening and raised a serious warning against
Plavsic's acts and foreign interference into Bosnia's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also noted that the nation was facing a very grave
political situation.
</P>
<P>
If the situation continues to worsen, it declared, the army
will act to defend the territorial integrity and sovereignty of
the republic in line with the constitution.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Reports Successful Reform in Commercial Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai is trying out a
modern enterprise system in the commercial businesses, in an
effort to improve their efficiency and economic returns.
</P>
<P>
The net assets of the 30 pilot businesses climbed 17.5 percent
in the first half of this year over the same period last year,
with the asset-to-liability ratio decreasing to 70.02 percent.
</P>
<P>
The reform also lifted Shanghai's gross retail sales to
75.66 billion yuan during the January-July period, a real growth
of 16.5 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Sales of the 30 pilot businesses alone topped 28 billion yuan
for the period.
</P>
<P>
Municipal officials say that 80 percent of the commercial
ventures will be transformed into shareholding firms this year,
with two thirds of the small-sized commercial businesses
introducing a cooperative shareholding system.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai had 620 joint-stock commercial ventures and 542
cooperative shareholding commercial businesses in June.

<HEADLINE> Launch Business Could Skyrocket </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- China consolidated its position
in the global commercial satellite launching market after a
successful flight last week, the "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The China Great Wall Industry Corp. sent a Philippino
telecommunications satellite into orbit on Wednesday using a Long
March 3B rocket.
</P>
<P>
It was the first successful Long March 3B flight after an
abortive attempt 18 months ago. That was the first time the
company tried to launch a Long March 3B satellite.
</P>
<P>
Russia, Ukraine and Japan are major rivals trying to challenge
France's dominant position.
</P>
<P>
Industry insiders said Wednesday's flight, as well as three
successful launches since last October, have restored public
confidence in LM launch vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Long March 3B rockets can carry satellites as heavy as 5,000
kilograms. Most of the world's satellites weigh no more than 4,500
kgs.
</P>
<P>
The Philippino satellite, made by US-based Space System Loral,
is one of high-power communications satellites which are expected
to become popular in the next few years. The satellites are
launched into geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO).
</P>
<P>
About 25 GTO satellites are launched annually worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said his company could clinch two or four GTO contracts
with foreign companies each year after 1997, now that the Long
March 3B has proven successful.
</P>
<P>
China covered less than nine percent of the global GTO market
from 1990 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's company lost several contracts after it failed to send
a satellite into orbit in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's launch was the first successful co-operation
between CGWIC and Loral.
</P>
<P>
While securing a stable share of the GTO satellite market,
China plans to take on low- and medium-orbit business.
</P>
<P>
Satellites orbiting the earth from about 1,000 to 10,000
kilometres away are used for mobile communications and interactive
communication networks.
</P>
<P>
About 600 or 700 lower-orbit satellites will be launched
worldwide by 2006, creating great opportunities for China's Long
March rockets, which can carry satellites as heavy as nine tons.
</P>
<P>
The LM-2C/SD launch vehicle has been developed for low earth
orbit. It will be used to launch IRIDIUM satellites according to a
contract between CGWIC and Motorola Inc.
</P>
<P>
This new device evolves from the LM-2C with new smart
dispensers.
</P>
<P>
CGWIC also plans to co-operate with foreign partners in
satellite applications and components.
</P>
<P>
Companies from the United States and Europe might be major
potential partners, but the United Sates has restricted its
companies by controlling high-tech exports.

PULAU PINANG, Malaysia, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier

Southeast Asian tour, after his four-day official visit to
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Li Peng held talks with Malaysian Prime

Saturday, said, "There are no differences between Malaysia and
China."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Slack Sales Drive Record Low Car Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Car imports are the lowest in
ten years because of fierce competition and government crack-downs
on illegal assembly of foreign-produced parts, the "China Daily"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, the auto import volume was 770
million US dollars, down 23.3 percent from the same period last
year. Exports rose 16.7 percent from the same period last year,
hitting 376 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
China imported 13,700 cars during that period, down 60 percent
in number and value.
</P>
<P>
"The market potential is huge, but demand is relatively weak,"
said Chen Ping, vice-president of the China Trading Centre for
Automobile Import (CTCAI).
</P>
<P>
She said most imported cars had engines ranging from 1.6 litres
to 2.0 litres, triggering a clash with domestically made
small-engine car makers.
</P>
<P>
Firm State measures to curtail car body and parts imports have
curbed illegal car assembly.
</P>
<P>
This year, CTCAI imported no cars, and its sole business was
selling hundreds of unsold sedans imported last year.
</P>
<P>
"We act as only a regulator in the market, rather than seeking
exorbitant profits," Chen said.

<HEADLINE> State Mulls Direct Bond Issue Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- China is considering allowing
large State enterprises to conduct direct overseas financing --
including bond issues in the international capital market and
foreign commercial loans, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The measure is aimed at creating new fund raising methods for
Chinese firms that are striving to reform their operations as the
country's market economy takes off.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange
(SAFE) said many firms applied for direct overseas financing
permission. Some have good credit ratings from international
rating companies.
</P>
<P>
The official said SAFE and the State Planning Commission were
studying the conditions and qualifications for overseas bond issues
by State firms.
</P>
<P>
"Allowing firms to issue bonds overseas is something to come
sooner or later," he said. "But the timetable will be fixed by
the State Council."
</P>
<P>
The official said firms build up their worldwide reputations
through bond issues and learn more about international financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
"The bond issue will make firms adapt to the international
market more quickly and increase their competitiveness," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Argentina, Brazil Deny Discord over U.N. Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ASUNCION, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Amid reports of a row between
Argentina and Brazil over Brazil's bid for the United Nations
Security Council permanent member status, the two countries'
presidents today denied that any problem has cropped up in their
relations.
</P>
<P>
Argentine President Carlos Menem and his Brazilian counterpart
Fernando Henrique Cardoso said during the Rio Group summit, which
opened here today, that there are no problems between the two
neighbors and they would solve any differences through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Argentina reportedly opposed Brazil's application for a
permanent seat in the U.N. Security Council, fearing it would
shatter "regional balance."
</P>
<P>
Menem said that the two nations are having dialogue on the
reform of the U.N. Security Council, including the voice and veto
of the council's members.
</P>
<P>
He said there is no problems in bilateral ties as all topics
concerning the consolidation of the Mercosur and the Latin
American integration are under discussion.
</P>
<P>
"And for any problems that could emerge, we try to find their
solution beforehand," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents, participating the two-day summit, said that
there is nothing more important than maintaining a good
understanding and unity between the two countries, major partners
in the booming regional bloc of the South American Common Market
(Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
Cardoso said the two countries consider as priorities the
strengthening of the Mercosur, which also groups Uruguay and
Paraguay, and the economic growth of the continent.
</P>
<P>
The Rio Group, founded in 1986 to coordinate member nations'
political and economic policies, embraces Argentina, Bolivia,
Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru,
Uruguay and Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> Science Stress Significant to Grain Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- China intends to make
agri-science support its growing population early in the next
century, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The country will have nearly 1.6 billion people by 2030 and
will need 640 million tons of grain a year.
</P>
<P>
The grain output last year was a record high of 490 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
"Although we can increase 500 million tons of grain by 2000
with available technology, we cannot secure another 150 million
tons from 2000 to 2030 without new breakthroughs," said an
official from the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
In the first 30 years of the next century, China will have to
increase its grain production capacity by 50 million tons every 10
years to feed a growing population, the official said.
</P>
<P>
As the world's most populous nation, China has endless
difficulties expanding arable land. "Science is the key," she
said. "The only way out for China's agriculture is a scientific
revolution."
</P>
<P>
Science constitutes 39 percent of China's grain output. She
said the proportion would be 50 percent y by 2000.
</P>
<P>
In developed countries, 70 or 80 percent of grain production
results from scientific progress.
</P>
<P>
The main task until 2000 will be to spread current agriculture
technology. From 2000 to 2020, China should strive to make
breakthroughs in the cultivation of super breeds of rice, corn and
wheat, as well as use water, fertilizer and soil resources more
efficiently. By 2030, China will have to make breakthroughs in
biological technology to sustain agricultural growth.
</P>
<P>
The official said China was accelerating research of high-yield
rice breeds, planting corn in the south, improving wheat quality
and spreading winter wheat to the north.
</P>
<P>
A super rice breed is being developed, but will not be applied
nationwide until for several years, she said.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Cotton Field Insured Against Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Cotton on a wide expanse of
farmland in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has
been insured against natural disasters, according to a regional
source.
</P>
<P>
Growers of the cotton, planted across an area of more than 13
million mu (about 860,000 ha), can get up to 10 million yuan
(about 1.2 million US dollars) in indemnity if their crop is hit
by natural adversities.
</P>
<P>
When plant disease and insects ravaged the crop during last
year's warm winter and the dry spell early this year, the Xinjiang
branch of the People's Insurance Company of China (Property), the
property insurance arm of China's leading insurer, paid more than
three million yuan in special funds to 44 cotton-growing counties,
effectively helping to curb the spread of harmful insects.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the regional insurance company has paid a
total of 80 million yuan in indemnity to overcome the effects of
snowstorms, floods and hail.

<HEADLINE> More inquiry Urged Into Misconducts of Italian Peacekeepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Italian Defense Minister Beniamino
Andreatta today called for reopening the investigation into the
alleged misconducts of Italian peacekeepers in Somalia as new
evidence came into light.
</P>
<P>
The commission led by the former Constitutional Court chief
Ettore Gallo should be reopened to do fresh investigation into the
allegations, Andreatta said.
</P>
<P>
On August 9, the commission ended six weeks of inquiry on the
alleged torture of Somali citizens by Italian troops on a UN
peacekeeping mission in Somalia from 1992 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
While concluding that isolated instances of torture did occur,
it cleared top ranking officers of all blame.
</P>
<P>
A 170-page diary kept by Italian officer Francesco Aloi between
May and July 1993 was brought into light recently and it lists
atrocities committed against the Somali civilian population by
Italian peacekeepers, including murder and rape.
</P>
<P>
With the new evidence, the reopening of the investigation will
be "extremely useful" and the commission should take up its
investigation again into the case as further serious indications
of misconduct had emerged, Andreatta said.

ROME, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Italian police detained more
illegal immigrants during regular police operations in various
parts of the country today, the ANSA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In Leece, Puglia, police operations led to the detention of 42
Albanians, including a pregnant woman.
</P>
<P>
In the northern city of Udine, 40 illegal Asian immigrants were
found. These immigrants, some from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, were
reported in dire straits: they were exhausted, famished and
without money or identification papers.
</P>
<P>
Police suspect that they had originally arrived in Italy by
hiding in freight containers aboard ships docking in Trieste,
about 60 kilometers southeast of Udine.
</P>
<P>
Nine of the immigrants were in such bad physical shape that
they had to be taken to hospital. The Red Cross is temporarily
sheltering the others. They will all be expelled, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The detention of an increasing number of illegal immigrants has
prompted a debate in the country.
</P>
<P>
Illegal immigration was linked to mounting allegations of
violence and criminal activities in the country.

<HEADLINE> Metallurgical Industry Stresses Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 24 (Xinhua) -- China's metallurgical industry
will concentrate on improving its product structure, rather than
striving for increased output, according to Liu Qi, minister of
the Metallurgical Industry.
</P>
<P>
China set a world record with steel production reaching 101.23
million tons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In a recent exclusive interview with Xinhua, Liu said China
plans to raise its per worker output of iron and steel from the
current 58 tons to 100 tons by the year 2000. China will
concentrate on producing steel with a high added value which will
be in great demand in the remaining years of the century.
</P>
<P>
Liu said China will try to raise the current ratio of 38 percent
of plates, sheets, strip products and rolled steel to 41 percent to
meet the market demand.
</P>
<P>
He added that the industry's continuous casting ratio, one of
the major indicators of the metallurgical industry's technical
development level, stands at 60 percent and will be raised to the
world average of 80 percent by 2000, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
China has won a victory in reducing the number of iron and
steel plants and concentrating the industry's production in fewer
companies, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five iron and steel plants currently each produce more
than one million tons annually. He said the plants account for 70
percent of the national output and 69 percent of the metallurgical
industry's assests.
</P>
<P>
Liu noted that "a number of small plants with outdated blast
furnaces and backward technology have been closed down over the
past five years."
</P>
<P>
China will continue to support the realignment of iron and
steel plants, Liu said, adding that roughly half of the nation's
nearly four million metallurgical workers can be declared
redundant.
</P>
<P>
Last year alone, 49 major companies reduced their workforces by
60 percent, with redundant workers finding new jobs in the service
sector. Liu pointed out that the rest of the redundant workers
will find new jobs within the year.
</P>
<P>
Liu admitted that China's metallurgical industry faces an
uphill battle in efforts to achieve its ambitious goal of
producing more products with a high added value over the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the industry has encountered difficulties in
soaring energy costs, falling prices for steel products and
intense market competition, particularly at a time when foreign
companies are trying to grab a bigger share of the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that Chinese companies currently occupy 91
percent of the market in terms of tonnage, but hold a mere 82
percent market share in terms of turnover.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who became the minister in 1993 after working many years
as an engineer and later as general manager of the Wuhan Iron and
Steel Company, expressed optimism over the industry's future.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that "the next few years will be a vital period
in which China's metallurgical industry will achieve technological
upgrading."
</P>
<P>
He concluded by saying that "China will become a powerful iron
and steel producer both in terms of tonnage and quality,"

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian swimmer Alexander Popov,
invincible for the past six years, collected his third gold medal
at the European swimming championships with a typically smooth
victory in the men's 50 meters freestyle in Seville, Spain on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
One year on from the night he was stabbed by a water-melon
seller on a Moscow street, Popov serenely maintained his record of
winning all his major championship freestyle races since his debut
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Popov, who has also won his fourth European 100 freestyle title
and led Russia to victory in the 4x100 freestyle relay, swung
clear in the second half of the one-length sprint to win in 22.30
seconds, the best time in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Mark Foster, world short-course 50 freestyle champion
in 1993, took the silver in 22.53 and Frenchman Julien Sicot the
bronze in 22.78.
</P>
<P>
It was a great day for the older generation, with three
swimmers more venerable than the seasoned Popov claiming gold in
the San Pablo pool.
</P>
<P>
The most loudly acclaimed winner was Spain's Martin Lopez
Zubero, born and based in the United States, but a Spanish
national hero since his Olympic 200 backstroke victory at the 1992
Barcelona Games.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old, clinched his fourth European 100 meters
backstroke title. Trailing seventh at the turn, he accelerated on
the second length to win in a modest 55.71 from Eithan Urbach, who
clinched Israel's first-ever European championship medal with a
silver in 55.88, and Russia's 200 backstroke gold medallist
Vladimir Selkov (55.97).
</P>
<P>
Franck Esposito recaptured the 200 meters butterfly crown he
won in 1991, surging through on the last half-length to overtake
Ukraine's Denis Silantiev for the gold.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Frenchman, bronze medallist to Silantiev's
silver in Wednesday's 100 butterfly, won by the handsome margin of
1.24 seconds in 1:57.24 to consign the Ukrainian to his second
silver.
</P>
<P>
Olympic and world champion Denis Pankratov, who had won the
European crown in 1993 and 1995, failed to make the final,
finishing 11th overall in the heats, nearly two seconds behind
Esposito.
</P>
<P>
The fourth vintage winner was 27-year-old Kerstin Kielgass, who
gained compensation for the loss of her 200 freestyle crown to
Ireland's Michelle de Bruin by winning the women's 800 freestyle.
</P>
<P>
Kielgass overtook Dutch pace-setter Carla Geurts in the second
half of the race to win in 8:34.41 from Geurts (8:36.14) and
fellow former East German Jana Henke (8:39.93).
</P>
<P>
Oxana Verevka, at 20 the youngest of the day's individual
champions, won the women's 200 individual medley in the absence of
Olympic champion De Bruin, who decided not to defend her European
crown because she was tired out after winning two golds and a
silver in three days.
</P>
<P>
Verevka, born in Ukraine but now competing for Russia, took the
lead from Martina Moravcova on the second length -- the backstroke
leg -- and built a big enough lead to resist a storming freestyle
finish from the Slovak swimmer, who had to settle for her third
silver medal of the championships.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Greece and the Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) today agreed to strengthen the
cultural cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued on the fringes of the seventh
Prespian'97 cultural festival today, Greece's Culture Minister
Evangelos Venizelos and his FYROM counterpart, Slobodan Unkofski,
said that they intended to launch "a lasting and systematic, yet
unofficial cooperation" in the sector of cultural creativity
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Both ministers stressed the need of strengthening cultural
cooperation between Greece and FYROM.
</P>
<P>
Venizelos said that culture was the most useful means to create
common understanding in the world.
</P>
<P>
In response, Unkofski said that it would take a long time for
the two countries to solve the name problem, but this did not mean
that cultural cooperation should not begin between the two
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Greece and FYROM are locked in an argument over the
name of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Greece opposes the use of the name Macedonia or its derivative
by Skopje on the grounds that it harbors territorial designs
against its northern region of the same name.

WASHINGTON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton

<P>
"To keep our economy growing and to create these good jobs, we
must keep tearing down foreign barriers to American goods and
services," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't seize these new opportunities, our competitors
surely will," Clinton said. He said he wants to use trade talks to
broaden U.S. access to markets in Latin America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
Fast track authority to enter into trade agreements has been
held by presidents since 1974, but that authority will expire
unless it is renewed next month.

<P>
Clinton said that other nations have already negotiated 20
trade agreements in Latin America and Asia and the United

reach trade agreements without burdensome delays.

"We have to continue to create high-wage jobs, and to do that
we must continue to expand American exports," Clinton said.

<P>
Clinton has promised to expand the current North American Free
Trade Agreement covering Mexico and Canada by creating a
hemisphere-wide free trade area by 2005. He also has committed to
reaching a free trade deal with Pacific Rim nations by 2010.
