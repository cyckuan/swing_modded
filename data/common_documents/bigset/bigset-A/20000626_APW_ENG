<HEADLINE> Tuition incentive tweaked to make National Guard more enticing  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The New York National Guard had a can't-miss
recruiting pitch with a bothersome catch.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers were eligible for free tuition at state colleges, but
the scholarship didn't kick in until after training was completed.
Since training can sometimes take over a year to finish, some
soldiers faced a dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were asking young men and women to go to school now without
a scholarship, or later with a scholarship,'' said New York's
deputy adjutant general, Brig. Gen. William Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. A change in law approved by Gov. George Pataki and
the Legislature makes the tuition benefits available as soon as a
soldier takes the oath to enlist. The National Guard believes the
change will improve an incentive program that is already credited
with dramatically boosting the guard's ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The original tuition assistance program was approved by Pataki
and the Legislature in 1996, a time of concern over the guards'
dwindling ranks. The program gave guard members free tuition at New
York's public colleges, or equal awards to soldiers studying at
private colleges. Annual tuition at the state university's
four-year schools is currently $3,400 for New York residents.
</P>
<P>
   The incentive has been credited with bringing the New York guard
from dead last among the 50 states in its ability to recruit and
retain soldiers to No. 1 in 1997. About 4,400 student soldiers have
taken advantage of the program since 1997. The state's Army
National Guard force has grown to 11,727, an increase of 371
soldiers in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The recruits have helped the guard during a busy stretch of
years in which they have been called up for everything from ice
storms to brush fires to the airlifting of junked cars from remote
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Other states noticed New York's powerful recruiting tool and
copied it. But guard brass noticed a troublesome quirk in their
program after talking with students and recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was timing. Basic training takes about nine weeks.
After that, required advanced training can take anywhere from under
five weeks to a couple of months, depending on whether the soldier
is training for computer repair or welding or something else.
Student soldiers often need two summers to complete training.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki included the accelerated tuition credit in his budget
proposal. The Legislature in May appropriated $3 million for the
tuition program this fiscal year, up from $2.75 million last year.
High school seniors graduating this month can receive benefits in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have taken a great program and made it even better,''
Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran recruiter Sgt. Ron Richmond of Rochester agrees, saying
the incentive program is unique in the military. He said it will
make the guard more enticing not only to recruits, but to parents
fearful their child might lose interest in higher education if it
is delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The change makes the guard more attractive,'' said Richmond,
the guard's education liaison. ''It makes an all-around better
picture for the student.''
</P>
<P>
   The guard has reached out to work with high schools, and some
counselors like the new program. Abby Hirsh, coordinator of
guidance and counseling for the Port Washington school district in
Long Island, said the tuition deal would particularly help children
with little money or who were educationally deprived.
</P>
<P>
   Martin predicted the ability to entice recruits who might not be
able to qualify for full scholarships otherwise will give the guard
a needed edge in a tight recruiting market.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economy is so strong that these kids are given a lot of
options,'' Martin said. ''And unless we've got a product that works
for them, they're going to take their business elsewhere.''

<HEADLINE> Lazio skips gay parade to visit dairy farmers  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST CHARLTON, N.Y. (AP) - Skipping a gay pride parade in New
York City that attracted his Senate rival Hillary Rodham Clinton,
Rick Lazio chose instead to visit with dairy farmers Sunday in
upstate Saratoga County.
</P>
<P>
   But at the farm, the congressman from Long Island faced new
questions about his dealings with major campaign contributors,
denying he had done anything special to help them in their fight
for federal assistance for a nursing home project.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish I could do 20 things at once. You can't,'' Lazio said
when asked about missing the annual gay pride parade. ''You just
have to make choices between a lot of different invitations that
you get.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had anything against marching in the parade, Lazio
said: ''If you had unlimited time, I'd say, 'Yeah.' There's nothing
wrong with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressman also said he had ''a very good relationship with
a number of folks in the gay community and advocates,'' and that he
had worked hard on help for AIDS victims and other issues of
importance to the gay community.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear, however, that courting traditionally more
conservative upstate was on Lazio's mind Sunday. He needs a strong
upstate vote to counter Clinton's expected big numbers coming out
of heavily Democratic New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get into a race five months before Election Day,
you've got to make choices among a lot of stops that you would like
to make, and upstate communities are very important both to the
campaign and to me personally,'' he said. ''People need to know me
well and I need to know what their issues are.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio spent more than 1-1/2 hours visiting the 700-acre Eildon
Tweed Farm of Dave and Connie Wood. Her family has been farming in
the area since 1794. While Lazio didn't milk any of the 375 cows,
he did pet one tolerant calf and helped served up sausage at an
annual dairy farmers' breakfast at the farm that drew more than
3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got my vote for sure,'' Kay Holbrook, working the food
line with Lazio, told the congressman.
</P>
<P>
   While Lazio sought to keep the mood upbeat, he faced questions
about a report in Sunday's New York Daily News that he had lobbied
the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development hard for
financial assistance for a $32.9 million nursing home project on
Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News said executives involved in the project had given
Lazio's campaign committee more than $35,000 and that contact with
HUD officials by Lazio in at least one instance came just two days
after the congressman got $13,000 from executives of Goldman Sachs,
the Wall Street firm financing the project.
</P>
<P>
   The tabloid said that lobbying by Lazio and his aides became so
intense that one top HUD official asked for an investigation of it
by the HUD inspector general's office.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News noted that HUD is headed by Andrew Cuomo, a major
booster of the first lady's Senate campaign, and that Clinton's
campaign manager is Bill de Blasio, who until November was HUD's
New York regional director.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be inappropriate to comment on this matter because it
has been referred to our inspector general's office for
investigation,'' Cuomo spokesman David Egner said Sunday when asked
about the Daily News report.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can neither confirm nor deny that there's any
investigation,'' said Michael Zerega, a spokesman for HUD Inspector
General Susan Gaffney who operates independently of Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said Sunday that he went to bat for the Oakwood Care
Center in Islip not because of campaign contributions, but because
of a shortage of nursing home beds and what he thought were lengthy
delays on the part of HUD in dealing with the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''The next thing you know, I'm going to be accused of coming
down to hard on the VA (Veterans Administration) for medals for
veterans,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman wields significant power over HUD as chairman of
House's subcommittee on housing. It oversees the department.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if politics might be playing a role in the possible probe
of his nursing home lobbying, Lazio laughed. ''I can't imagine
there's politics at HUD,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio is already facing a preliminary investigation by the
federal Securities and Exchange Commission over his stock option
trading in another company headed by other major campaign
contributors. He has denied any insider trading knowledge in that
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman said Sunday that he feels the Clinton campaign
is ''obviously behind all this negative attack ... Their entire
M.O. is to harass, to try and bring people down to their level and
to have a negative campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Clinton has already aired five television ads
attacking him, Lazio said, ''They are making a big mistake in
deciding to go down this path of just negative, negative, negative,
negative. It turns people off and creates more cynicism about
public service.'' Lazio predicted that New Yorkers would ''hold her
accountable for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If Rick Lazio really felt that way he shouldn't have started
the campaign by attacking Hillary,'' said Clinton spokeswoman Karen
Dunn. ''Hillary will continue to talk about the issues whether Rick
Lazio likes it or not.''

<HEADLINE> County gets court order in fight against troubled concert  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORTLAND, N.Y. (AP) - A benefit music festival is now being
driven out of a second county.
</P>
<P>
   Cortland County, the City of Cortland and the city school
district have won a preliminary injunction that could in effect
cancel Musicstock 2000 Central New York Rock for Hunger, the
Cortland Standard reported. The concert was advertised on the
Internet for Friday through Sunday at the county fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Phillip Rumsey said Friday there is
clear evidence the concert would constitute a nuisance, the
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am delighted and feel much better,'' said Raymond Thorpe,
Cortlandville town supervisor. ''Our main objective is the safety
of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials have criticized the Musicstock organizers for poor
preparation including plans for traffic, public health of campers
and other concerns. For example, bands were expected to provide
security when not performing.
</P>
<P>
   Musicstock's Internet site calls for a ''peaceful protest and
rally against politicians who are trying to control your freedom of
assembly and expression'' if the concert is canceled. The protest
is planned for Saturday from noon to 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''What amazes us is it's OK for Country music acts to play in
Cortland but here we have them discriminating against rock acts,''
the organization states.
</P>
<P>
   With just a week before the scheduled opening, promoter Nick
Papatonis could try to appeal to the state Supreme Court Appellate
Division to delay Rumsey's decision. Papatonis wasn't available for
comment Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The concert, which was to feature more than 50 bands and attract
500 people or more each day, has been promoted as a non-profit
event to benefit local food pantries.
</P>
<P>
   Papatonis originally planned to stage the festival in Cayuga
County but local officials there also had concerns about planning
and canceled the event because it did not have the required
permits.

<HEADLINE> Vatican Discloses Details of Fatima  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Aiming to discourage further speculation
about the so-called third secret of Fatima, the Vatican was laying
out in detail the messages three Portuguese shepherd children said
they received from the Virgin Mary in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II entrusted the task to his guardian of
orthodoxy, German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who was to release a
text on the so-called last secret of Fatima and a commentary at a
news conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   During the pope's visit last month to the Fatima shrine, another
top prelate, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, revealed that the secret
foretold the 1981 shooting of John Paul in St. Peter's Square. Many
for decades feared it was a doomsday prophecy too terrifying to
unveil.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican was expected Monday to also release a photograph of
the message written by the only living member of the shepherd trio,
Lucia de Jesus dos Santos, now a 93-year-old cloistered nun.
</P>
<P>
   Italian author Vittorio Messori, who collaborated on John Paul's
best-selling book ''Crossing the Threshold of Hope,'' wrote in
Sunday's Corriere della Sera that the Vatican wanted ''to
immediately block other legends being added to the too many ones
already in circulation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What's really in that mythical secret?'' Messori wrote. ''What
we can say for now, respecting the obligatory discretion, is that
after so much waiting, so many inferences, so much
theology-fiction, someone, in search of apocalyptical emotions,
will risk being disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two secrets are said to have foretold the end of World
War I and the start of World War II, and the rise and fall of
Soviet communism.
</P>
<P>
   Sodano, speaking last month at Fatima, said the
''interpretations'' of the children were of ''a bishop clothed in
white'' who, while making his way amid the corpses of martyrs,
''falls to the ground, apparently dead, under a burst of gunfire.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1981 assassination attempt against John Paul occurred on May
13, the same day that the young shepherds in 1917 first reported
visions of Mary.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after Sodano unveiled the secret, Ratzinger said that
Catholics are free to believe or not believe the secret, since such
apparitions do not constitute Catholic doctrine.

<HEADLINE> Mexicans Worry About Election  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI CARL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The economy is solid, and Mexico is about to
hold a presidential election expected to be the fairest in its
history.
</P>
<P>
   That has many Mexicans worried.
</P>
<P>
   The past four presidential elections have been preceded by
assurances of economic strength, immediately followed by crises
that sent inflation, interest rates and unemployment soaring.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of Mexicans don't believe the government's
predictions that this time will be different, recent surveys show.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are already prepared'' for another crash, said Manuel
Moreno, an engineer who was forced to give up buying a house in
1994 when the last plunge dried up bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding his newborn son on a park bench here, Moreno said he is
taking precautions this time by saving extra money and buying real
estate -- before problems start.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's boom-bust phenomenon is so reliable it is known here as
''the sexenio curse'' -- a crash that occurs every six years, with
the change of president.
</P>
<P>
   Recent history isn't all that's causing skepticism. Most polls
show opposition candidate Vicente Fox in a tight race with
Francisco Labastida, whose Institutional Revolutionary Party has a
71-year hold on the presidency. Some worry a narrow victory on July
2 could spur political instability.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials argue that the peso is strong, inflation is
down and the economy is expected to grow by nearly 5 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
   They note the deficit in Mexico's current account -- which
measures trade in goods and services as well as investment flows --
is down significantly from 1994, when President Ernesto Zedillo
took office.
</P>
<P>
   The improvement owes largely to the North American Free Trade
Agreement six years ago, which triggered a boom in U.S.-Mexico
trade that has created thousands of jobs for Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   Spreading out Mexico's reliance, a new open trade agreement with
the European Union comes into force on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Should another crisis occur, the government has put together $24
billion in guarantees and lines of credit to help it cope.
</P>
<P>
   Some are convinced. Moody's Investors Services increased
Mexico's credit rating in March to investment grade from ''junk''
status, saying it was confident Mexico could pay back its foreign
debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every indication that we have is that the economy is going
along at a very good cycle of growth with decreasing inflation,''
said Manuel Suarez-Mier, a senior economist at the Center for
Investigation of Development, a Mexican political and economic
think-tank.
</P>
<P>
   Suarez-Mier points out that Mexico has switched to a floating
exchange rate for the peso -- allowing the market to determine its
value against other currencies -- from a system of government
controls that artificially inflated the peso and led to the 1994
economic meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   The government's biggest challenge has been calming expectations
of a crisis, Suarez-Mier said. If the ruling party wins by a slim
margin, calming investor fears may be hard.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people believe there is a serious threat of violence, then
anything can happen and the armoring of the economy will not be
much help,'' Suarez-Mier said.
</P>
<P>
   A guerrilla uprising in Chiapas state and two major political
assassinations also helped scare away investors in 1994. The flight
contributed to the government's near-default on billions of dollars
in short-term debt, which prompted a $50 billion U.S.-led bailout
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Many Mexicans still haven't recovered from the crisis, which
caused wages to plummet, ruined businesses and dried up bank loans.
It also hurt U.S. pension plans and mutual funds investing in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months, Mexico's stock market and the peso have
slipped on election jitters.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Jonathan Heath, author of the book ''Mexico and the
Sexenio Curse,'' said it would take a major political crisis -- such
as a wide perception that the election was unfair -- to harm the
economy. But there's reason to be cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that anybody who follows Mexico and knows Mexico's
history has to be relatively nervous,'' he said. ''We always end up
screwing things up no matter what the government has promised.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is worried.
</P>
<P>
   Uri Boltvinik, a manager of four restaurants in Mexico, is
hoping to open a fifth eatery with help from an American investor.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't bracing for a crisis, but says an opposition victory
could trigger one if the ruling party sabotages the economy before
handing over power Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope there's not going to be any crisis, and I think that's
everyone's hope: that we can finally have a democracy without any
economic problems,'' Boltvinik said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher today as investors looked
ahead to the Federal Reserve's meeting this week and guessed that
central bankers will leave interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 138.77 at 10,543.52.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 11.45 at 1,452.93, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 28.93 at 3,874.27.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was fairly light as investors looked ahead to the Fed's
impending decision on interest rates, to be announced on Wednesday.
Most economists believe the Fed will leave rates unchanged, sensing
that six rate increases in the past year are successfully slowing
the economy to a more sustainable pace.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which benefit from stable interest rates, led
the blue-chip Dow higher Monday. J.P. Morgan rose $2 to $119.25 and
Citigroup rose $1.50 to $63.188.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Dow component Philip Morris rose $2.563 to $26.188 in the
first trading session since the company announced its purchase of
Nabisco Holdings Corp. for $14.9 billion plus the assumption of $4
billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Once the deal is completed, Philip Morris plans to begin work on
an initial public offering of 20 percent of the stock in the newly
combined food company.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 117.88 million
shares, ahead of Friday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.36 to 512.77.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.2 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.3 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
0.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Court Says Oil Companies Due Payment  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two huge oil companies are entitled to recover
about $158 million from the federal government for an offshore
oil-and-gas deal that never materialized, the Supreme Court ruled
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The justices voted 8-1 in a breach-of-contract lawsuit against
the government by Mobil and Marathon stemming from their ill-fated
attempt to explore for oil and gas off North Carolina's Outer
Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision did not just stop at reinstating the lawsuit.
The justices also said the government must give Mobil and Marathon
their money back.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also could carry significant impact for the
multitude of other businesses that enter into contracts with the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Each company paid more than $78 million to the government in
1981 for Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas leases for submerged
lands about 40 miles off Cape Hatteras, N.C. Their lawsuit said
efforts to drill exploratory wells were stymied when Congress
enacted the Outer Banks Protection Act in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The law ''expressly prohibited the United States from fulfilling
its contractual obligations,'' lawyers for Marathon Oil had told
the justices, by imposing a moratorium on exploration or
development in that area of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   A federal claims court ruled that the two oil companies must get
their money back. But a federal appeals court threw out that
judgment after ruling last year that the lease agreements had not
been breached.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said the oil companies had ''been unable to
obtain the necessary government approvals that would allow (them)
to go forward with the exploration of the lease site, a problem
that arose in 1989, before the OBPA was enacted and continued after
the OBPA was repealed'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the appeals court said the law aimed at
protecting the Outer Banks was not the exclusive cause of the oil
company's inability to tap into the oil and gas resources there.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the nation's highest court said the appeals court was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''The oil companies gave the United States $158 million in
return for a contractual promise to follow the terms of
pre-existing statutes and regulations,'' Justice Stephen G. Breyer
wrote for the court. ''The new statute prevented the government
from keeping that promise ... And therefore the government must
give the companies their money back.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Justice John Paul Stevens dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron Oil currently is seeking the right to drill an
exploratory oil well in the same Outer Banks area.
</P>
<P>
   The cases are Mobil Oil Exploratory &AMP; Producing Southeast Inc.
v. U.S., 99-244, and Marathon Oil Co. v. U.S., 99-253.

<HEADLINE> Court To Hear Voting District Fight  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed to use a
voting-rights dispute over a North Carolina congressional district,
possibly to try clarifying how to determine when race played too
large a role in drawing election districts.
</P>
<P>
   The court said Monday it will study an appeal in which state
officials argue that politics -- not race -- was the main factor in
drawing the 12th congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge court invalidated that district and ordered it
redrawn, but Monday's action puts that order on hold until the
justices hear arguments and issue a ruling.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's 12th district is represented by Democrat Mel
Watt, one of two blacks elected to Congress in 1992 from a state
that had not sent a black to Washington since 1901.
</P>
<P>
   Disputes over the district have led to three previous Supreme
Court rulings, starting with a 1993 decision that said voting
districts designed to help minorities can be invalidated if they
violate white voters' rights.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Supreme Court declared that an earlier version of
the district, which had a 57 percent majority of blacks among
registered voters, was unlawfully based on race.
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers redrew the district in 1997, creating one 71
miles long in which blacks comprised 46 percent of registered
voters. A federal court ruled it unconstitutional in 1998, and the
primaries were delayed so the Legislature could go back to the
drawing table.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Supreme Court reversed the 1998 ruling, saying
the lower court wrongly decided the case without first holding a
trial.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the three-judge panel again ruled the 12th district
unlawful, saying legislators ''utilized race as the predominant
factor in drawing the district.'' The state did not offer
compelling reasons to justify such use of race, the three-judge
court said. It concluded that the district was ''an impermissible
and unconstitutional racial gerrymander.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials and voters who supported the district as drawn
appealed to the Supreme Court. The state's appeal said the lower
court ''wrongly equated mere consideration of race with racial
gerrymandering,'' and argued that lawmakers were mainly concerned
with creating a safe Democratic district.
</P>
<P>
   The state's lawyers also said it would be too disruptive to
require the district redrawn with this fall's election only months
away.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for those who challenged the district said trial
evidence showed that ''race was the only explanation'' for the way
the 12th district was drawn.
</P>
<P>
   The cases are Hunt vs. Cromartie, 99-1864, and Smallwood vs.
Cromartie, 99-1865.

<HEADLINE> Court To Hear Appeal of Murder Case  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide
whether a Texas man who confessed to two 1993 killings and led
police to the victims' grave is entitled to a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said they will review a Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals ruling that overturned Raymond Cobb's murder conviction and
death sentence. The state court said police violated Cobb's right
to his lawyer's help while being questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Texas argued that the state court adopted too
expansive a view of criminal suspects' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie Owings and her 16-month-old daughter, Kori Rae,
disappeared from their home in rural Walker County, Texas, two days
after Christmas 1993. Their house had been burglarized.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb, 17 at the time, was a neighbor. An anonymous tip led
police in February 1994 to suspect him in the burglary. He
eventually admitted burglarizing the house but denied any
involvement in the disappearances.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb was indicted on burglary charges and had a lawyer, Hal
Ridley, appointed to represent him. Ridley twice gave police
permission to talk to Cobb about the disappearances.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1995, Cobb was out on bond and living in Odessa, Texas,
when his father called Walker County police and said Raymond Cobb
had confessed to killing Maggie and Kori Rae Owings.
</P>
<P>
   Based on his father's statement, Odessa police arrested Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning, Cobb confessed to the murders. When returned
to Walker County, he led police to a place in the woods where he
said he had buried the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb's confession to Odessa police and his cooperation in
locating the grave was used as evidence at his murder trial. He was
convicted and sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   But the Court of Criminal Appeals reversed his conviction by a
6-3 vote last March, ruling that police should have notified Ridley
before questioning Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once (Cobb) was indicted for the Owings burglary, his Sixth
Amendment right to counsel attached to that offense and to the
capital murder offense, which was factually interwoven with the
burglary,'' the state court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on Monday, Texas Attorney General John
Cornyn and his staff argued that the state court wrongly expanded a
1986 ruling in which the nation's highest court barred police from
questioning suspects who have requested a lawyer at an arraignment
or similar court hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal noted that Cobb merely had accepted Ridley's
representation of him when he was arraigned on the burglary charge.
The state's lawyers also argued that Ridley was Cobb's lawyer only
for the burglary, not for the murder case.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Texas v. Cobb, 99-1702.

<HEADLINE> Court Again Limits Prayer in Schools  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court set aside a ruling Monday
that let public school students in an Alabama county lead group
prayers at graduations, assemblies and sports events.
</P>
<P>
   The justices told a federal appeals court to restudy the case in
light of a major school-prayer decision they announced last week in
a Texas case. In that ruling, the court said prayer in public
schools must be private and that such prayers at high school
football games violate the constitutionally required separation of
church and state.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's brief order, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
was told to rethink the Alabama case in light .
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's landmark 1962 decision outlawed organized,
officially sponsored prayers in public schools. In 1992, the
justices barred clergy-led prayers at public school graduation
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, Alabama legislators enacted a law requiring
public schools to allow student-initiated prayer at ''compulsory or
non-compulsory'' school activities including sporting events,
student assemblies and graduations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Michael Chandler and his son, Jesse, challenged the law
and its enforcement in DeKalb County public schools.
</P>
<P>
   They said Jesse's school let students lead Christian prayers in
classrooms and over the intercom, and allowed students or clergy to
lead prayers at graduations, football games and student assemblies.
Gideon Bibles were handed out in classrooms by non-school
personnel, they said.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge declared the law unconstitutional and barred all
non-private prayer, including student-initiated prayer at
graduations, assemblies and football games.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed last July,
saying courts could not prohibit ''genuinely student-initiated
religious speech'' at school events, including graduations, or
impose restrictions greater than those on non-religious student
speech.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ordered the judge to rewrite the order, saying
the court could bar school officials from encouraging student
religious activity and appoint a monitor to ensure such actions do
not recur. The court let stand the judge's ruling that declared the
state law unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on Monday, the Chandlers' lawyers said
schools cannot ''engage unwilling students in religious activity as
part of school-controlled events.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Truly private prayer neither seeks nor requires a microphone
and an audience,'' the appeal said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the state and county said the 11th Circuit court's
ruling ''gives genuinely private religious speech no greater
privilege than genuinely private nonreligious speech.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Chandler vs. Siegelman, 99-935.

<HEADLINE> Court Leaves Open Miranda Lawsuits  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court left intact rulings that say
police officers may be sued for continuing to question criminal
suspects after they invoke their ''right to remain silent.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices, who upheld the constitutionality of the so-called
Miranda warnings Monday, rejected an appeal in a California case
that asked the same basic question: Are the police warnings
required by the Supreme Court's landmark 1966 ruling
constitutionally mandated?
</P>
<P>
   At stake in the California case was whether police can be sued
for violating the Miranda decision after giving the required
warnings by ignoring suspects' requests for a lawyer or their
desire to remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   Lower courts allowed such lawsuits. Those rulings were left
undisturbed in a brief order Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, far more liberal 34 years ago than it is
today, sought to remedy ''inherently coercive'' interrogations by
creating bright-line guidelines in its Miranda vs. Arizona
decision. Courts previously had used a
''totality-of-the-circumstances'' test to determine whether a
confession or incriminating statement had been given to police
voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution's Fifth Amendment says ''No person ... shall be
compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.''
</P>
<P>
   In the California case, two convicted killers sued police in Los
Angeles and Santa Monica from their prison cells. Invoking a
much-used civil rights law, the two sought monetary damages for
violations of their Fifth Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, police officers continued questioning the suspect
after he said he no longer wanted to talk without a lawyer present.
The officers' persistence paid off because both made incriminating
remarks later in the interrogations.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the suspect's statement to police was used to
attack his credibility after he testified at trial. In the other,
the statement was totally excluded from the trial.
</P>
<P>
   A federal trial judge refused to shield the police officers from
the convicted killers' lawsuits, ruling that they were not entitled
to qualified immunity.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling last
November, sparking the police officers' appeal acted on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Some California police departments routinely advise officers to
circumvent the Miranda warnings. A training videotape shown to
departments statewide is entitled ''Questioning Outside Miranda,''
and in it, a prosecutor tells officers they can keep questioning
even after suspects ask for an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Any statements made thereafter are inadmissible as primary
evidence against a defendant, but the controversial video tells
police that the statements may help them recover property, locate
other witnesses or find additional evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to fend off the lawsuits, lawyers for the Los Angeles
and Santa Monica officers said violating the Miranda warnings does
not amount to a constitutional violation. They also said the
officers reasonably believed they could rely on the training video.
</P>
<P>
   In upholding the lawsuits, the 9th Circuit court said the
Miranda ruling ''cannot be viewed entirely apart from the
constitutional rights that it protects.''
</P>
<P>
   The November decision added: ''Miranda could scarcely be more
clear in stating that once a suspect indicates in any manner, at
any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain
silent, the interrogation must cease, and that if he states that he
wants an attorney the interrogation must cease until an attorney is
present.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Butts vs. McNally, 99-1594.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Denies Racist Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court rejected the appeal of an
Illinois white supremacist who says the state committee that denied
him a law license violated his free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   The court, acting without comment Monday, turned away Matthew
Hale's arguments that Illinois has established ''orthodox religious
and political beliefs to which (an aspiring lawyer) must subscribe
as a condition of admission.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale, an East Peoria resident and leader of the segregationist
World Church of the Creator, was denied a law license last summer
even though he graduated from Southern Illinois University's law
school and passed the state bar exam.
</P>
<P>
   State bar officials noted that Hale had ''dedicated his life to
inciting racial hatred,'' and said ''he cannot do this as an
officer of the court.'' The Illinois Supreme Court refused to hear
Hale's appeal last November.
</P>
<P>
   Hale's appeal said he cannot lawfully be excluded from the legal
profession ''on the basis of his beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In a time when political correctness runs rampant through our
government and academia, and political, social and religious litmus
tests are becoming the norm for appointment to the bench, the need
for guidance from this court is acute,'' the appeal said.
</P>
<P>
   Hale's lawyer, Robert Herman, likened Hale's treatment to that
of Jehovah's Witnesses schoolchildren who were disciplined in the
early 1940s for refusing to recite a mandatory Pledge of
Allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   When the Supreme Court overturned the mandatory policy in 1943,
it said: ''If there is any fixed star in our constitutional
constellation, it is that no official high or petty can prescribe
what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion or other
matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act
their faith therein.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman argued, ''Lawyers do not relinquish their constitutional
rights as a condition for practicing law.''
</P>
<P>
   Illinois Bar officials urged the justices to turn down Hale's
appeal, saying he had failed to prove he has ''good moral
character.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As opposed to being excluded from Illinois' bar on the basis
of beliefs or speech, Hale's past conduct, lack of credibility and
inability to meet his burden of (good character) proof doomed his
bar application,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the state committee's rejection of Hale, a former
member of his group went on a shooting spree. Benjamin Smith
targeted minorities, killing two people and injuring several others
before killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   Hale later said it was possible the shootings were the result of
the committee's action, a remark state bar officials said further
proved he lacks the ''moral character necessary to satisfy even
minimal bar admission standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Hale v. Committee on Character and Fitness, 99-1349.

<HEADLINE> Genetic Discrimination Feared  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- What happens if there is a genetic revolution
in medicine and nobody shows up? Experts worry that patients will
not want to use the new technology if jobs or insurance are
threatened by genetic discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Once all the disease-causing genes are identified, researchers
say it will be possible for people at high risk of cancer or heart
disease to be identified by their genetic code. The genes, in
effect, could forecast years in advance who will get sick and who
will not.
</P>
<P>
   Employers and health insurance companies could save millions of
dollars by not hiring or enrolling people whose genes show them to
be highly susceptible to diseases, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Gene discrimination could, thus, join the list of other forms of
discrimination -- racial, ethnic and sexual.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we might have the scientific basis for a whole new
revolution in medicine, we might find that nobody wants to
participate because of their fears of misuse,'' said Dr. Francis
Collins, head of the National Human Genome Research Institute.
''That would be a terrible tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Already people are expressing their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   A Time/CNN poll appearing this week in Time found that 75
percent of 1,218 surveyed Americans did not want insurance
companies to know their genetic code. Eighty-four percent didn't
want the government to know.
</P>
<P>
   For their own personal use, though, 61 percent of those polled
wanted to know if they were genetically predisposed to disease and
67 percent wanted to share their genetic code with their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Collins and others believe that a federal law forbidding genetic
discrimination is ''absolutely essential'' for people to take full
advantage of the genetic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without a law, the public is going to be fearful of having
this information derived from them,'' said Collins.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton already has issued an executive order
forbidding genetic discrimination against federal employees. But
for the rest of the public, there is no such federal protection.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in the House and the Senate have proposed anti-genetic
discrimination statutes, but neither bill has progressed very far
in the legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic discrimination ''is happening today in job sites all
around the country,'' Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. said last week.
''Individuals are being turned down. They are denied promotions. It
is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is a co-sponsor of Senate bill 1322.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt warned that ''millions of
Americans may be afraid to have genetic testing done because the
results of those tests could put their health insurance in
jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Social policy must keep pace with science,'' said Rep. Louise
Slaughter of New York, the sponsor of House bill H.R. 2457.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents hope to force a vote in the House by getting 218
members to sign on in support of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   John Feehery, a spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., said the Republican majority would push some version of the
bill, but questioned the motivation of Democrats supporting the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Trying to make politics out of this seems to be rather
curious,'' Feehery said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 146; Nasdaq Up 49  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher Monday as investors
looked ahead to the Federal Reserve's meeting this week and guessed
that central bankers will leave interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 146.37 at 10,551.12.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 15.93 at 1,457.41, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 49.48 at 3,894.82.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was fairly light as investors looked ahead to the Fed's
impending decision on interest rates, to be announced on Wednesday.
Most economists believe the Fed will leave rates unchanged, sensing
that six rate increases in the past year are successfully slowing
the economy to a more sustainable pace.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have less than one week left before the end of the quarter,
and it appears that some people are willing to put funds to work
now based on the fact that the Fed may leave rates unchanged,''
said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which benefit from stable interest rates, led
the blue-chip Dow higher Monday. J.P. Morgan rose $1.50 to $118.75
and Citigroup rose $1.313 to $63.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Dow component Philip Morris rose $3.188 to $26.813 in the
first trading session since the company announced its purchase of
Nabisco Holdings Corp. for $14.9 billion plus the assumption of $4
billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Once the deal is completed, Philip Morris plans to begin work on
an initial public offering of up to 15 percent of the stock in the
newly combined food company.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, which comes amid a flurry of consolidation in the
food industry, also boosted the broader market, Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It energizes the market,'' he said. ''And it gets massive
amounts of cash flowing through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 278.36 million shares
at late morning, on par with Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.69 to 512.10.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Chamber of Commerce sued the Labor
Department Monday, seeking the repeal of new regulations allowing
states to offer paid leave to new parents using unemployment
benefit dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're putting a fund at risk that was set up for unemployed
workers,'' said chamber vice president Randy Johnson. ''At some
point a recession is going to hit and there's not going to be
enough money to provide benefits for unemployed workers and people
taking family leave.''
</P>
<P>
   New federal regulations, ordered by President Clinton and
written by the Labor Department earlier this month, would allow
states to offer unemployment benefits to parents of newborn or
newly adopted children who choose to take up to 12 weeks of leave
guaranteed under the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials were reviewing the lawsuit and did not
immediately comment.
</P>
<P>
   States that want to provide the paid leave would have to pass
their own laws in order to do so. None has yet, but legislators in
a number of states are considering the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber of Commerce is asking the U.S. District Court for
the District of Columbia to grant an injunction blocking any state
program enacted during judicial proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment fund is financed by taxes on businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Some state unemployment insurance programs are flush with cash
because the booming economy has more people working than at any
time in 30 years. In the past, however, the federal government
often has had to bail out states as they ran short of money to pay
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber of Commerce is challenging the new regulations on
grounds that they violate federal laws, including one reserving
unemployment benefits for those who are actively looking for, but
cannot find work.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers also have questioned the legality of
Clinton's unilateral move.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, administration officials note that other
exceptions have been made to the law in cases when time away from
work may improve a person's long-term employment situation -- for
example, providing unemployment benefits to people in certain job
training programs.
</P>
<P>
   Two other business groups, LPA Inc. and the Society for Human
Resource Management, plus two companies -- Counterpulsation Inc., of
Framingham, Mass., and Danneman's Auto Service Inc. of Laurel, Md.
-- have joined the Chamber of Commerce lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Cybersquatting Case  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania forced
to give up its Internet name in a ''cybersquatting'' dispute lost a
Supreme Court appeal Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, turned down arguments by Sporty's
Farm that it wrongly was forced to give up the Web site name
''sportys.com'' to another company.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is between Sporty's and Sportsman's Market of
Batavia, Ohio, which sells aviation-related products through
mail-order catalogs. Sportsman's registered ''sporty's'' as a
trademark in 1985 and uses the name on its catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Omega Engineering of Stamford, Conn., registered the
Internet site name sportys.com. Omega makes scientific measurement
and control instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Omega formed Sporty's Farm in Sterling, Pa., the following year
to grow and sell Christmas trees, and it sold the Internet name to
the farm.
</P>
<P>
   Sporty's and Sportsman's sued each other in federal court in
Connecticut in 1996. A judge, ruling under the Federal Trademark
Dilution Act, decided the farm was harming Sportsman's trademark
and ordered the farm to surrender the Internet name.
</P>
<P>
   While the case was being appealed, Congress enacted the
Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act last November. The law
lets trademark holders force other people to give up an Internet
name that is identical or very similar to the trademark. It applies
to Internet names registered before and after the law took effect.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals relied on
the new law as it upheld the judge's ruling. The appeals court said
it need not send the case back to the judge because his findings
were sufficient to allow the appeals court to apply the new law.
</P>
<P>
   The 2nd Circuit court said there was ''overwhelming evidence''
that Sporty's Farm acted with bad faith. Omega was trying to keep
Sportsman's from using the ''sporty's'' name on the Internet
because Omega planned to begin competing with Sportsman's in the
aviation consumer market, the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   The farm's lawyers told the justices the case should have been
returned to the lower court. The appeal also said that forcing
Sporty's to give up its Internet name was an unlawful taking of its
property without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Sporty's Farm v. Sportsman's Market, 99-1752.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Advises Vs. Gas Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton sought to temper calls for
rolling back the federal gas tax in this summer of high fuel costs,
saying Monday that such a move would disrupt federal highway
projects and provide little relief to American motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in the Rose Garden, the president noted
that gas prices seem to be falling on their own, ''for whatever
reason,'' in places where they were notoriously high, such as the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   He urged continued pressure on the oil industry to keep prices
falling and suggested that Congress think hard about the
far-reaching ramifications before cutting the gas tax.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Congress wants to consider some sort of relief on the
federal gas tax, it would be modest compared to the price increase,
and they would have to be willing to defer substantial federal
highway projects,'' Clinton said. ''So, that's something they have
to come to terms with.''
</P>
<P>
   Some congressional Republicans want to lower the federal
gasoline tax in response to increasing pump prices. The matter
found its way onto the presidential campaign trail, with Texas Gov.
George Bush, the GOP candidate, attributing the spike in gas prices
to the Clinton administration's anti-pollution regulations. His
Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, put the blame on big
oil companies that he says are out to maximize their profits at
consumers' expense.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation introduced earlier this year would have rolled back
4.3 cents of the 18.4-cent tax for the rest of the year and
suspended it entirely if average prices exceeded $2 a gallon. The
measure lost momentum after some oil-producing nations agreed to
increase their output.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the current crisis underscores the need to speed
U.S. efforts to develop alternative fuels and put high-mileage
vehicles ''that can get 60, 80, maybe more miles per gallon,'' on
the road. He decried what he called a lack of support from the oil
industry and the GOP leadership for those efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should do more here,'' Clinton said. ''What the American
people want to know is that we've got a plan that will move them
away from being subject to these kind of radical (price) swings.
And we do have a plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, however, offered little short-term relief for
consumers beyond a Federal Trade Commission inquiry into possible
price gouging by the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the prices are being set for non-economic reasons, we ought
to do what we can to pressure them down,'' Clinton said. ''I think
it's clear over the next two years you're going to have all these
cars coming out that will basically make this problem go away as we
know it. We need to do everything we can to accelerate it.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 123; Nasdaq Up 21  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip Morris led the Dow Jones industrial
average higher Monday as investors applauded its plan to buy the
snack food business Nabisco Holdings Corp. The merger helped
investors take their focus off the Federal Reserve's meeting this
week.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 123.39 at 10,528.14.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 9.07 at 1,450.55, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 20.90 at 3,866.24.
</P>
<P>
   Dow component Philip Morris rose $3.25 to $26.875 in the first
trading session since the Sunday announcement of its proposed
purchase of Nabisco for $14.9 billion plus the assumption of $4
billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Once the deal is completed, Philip Morris plans to begin work on
an initial public offering of up to 15 percent of the stock in the
newly combined food company. Philip Morris owns Kraft Foods and
Nabisco Holdings makes Ritz crackers, Snackwell's snacks, Oreo
cookies and Life Savers candy.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, which comes amid a flurry of consolidation in the
food industry, also boosted the broader market, said Alan Ackerman,
senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ''It energizes the market,'' he said. ''And it gets massive
amounts of cash flowing through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading was fairly light as investors looked ahead to the Fed's
impending decision on interest rates, to be announced on Wednesday.
Most economists believe the Fed will leave rates unchanged, sensing
that six rate increases in the past year are successfully slowing
the economy to a more sustainable pace.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have less than one week left before the end of the quarter,
and it appears that some people are willing to put funds to work
now based on the fact that the Fed may leave rates unchanged,''
Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which benefit from stable interest rates, led
the blue-chip Dow higher Monday. J.P. Morgan rose 75 cents to $118
and Citigroup rose $1.688 to $63.375.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson added to the Dow's strength, rising $5.125 to
$94.875. PaineWebber analyst David Lothson raised his rating on the
stock to ''buy'' from ''neutral,'' saying the company's solid
earnings growth makes it a good investment should interest rates
continue rising.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mounting a modest recovery from last
week's selloff, but investors were focusing on the strongest,
best-capitalized companies. Oracle rose $1.25 to $80.75 and Sun
Microsystems rose $3.313 to $89.875.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 583.06 million
shares by midafternoon, on par with Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.47 to 509.94.

<HEADLINE> Court Nixes 'Blanket' Primaries  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, in a ruling two dissenting
justices said threatens the primary election systems in half the
states, threw out California's wide-open primary election process
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a 7-2 ruling, the justices said states violate political
parties' rights when they let primary voters choose nominees by
voting for any candidate, regardless of party affiliation. Two
other states have systems similar to California's ''blanket
primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court, Justice Antonin Scalia said California
was ''forcing political parties to associate with those who do not
share their beliefs.'' He said that created a ''severe and
unnecessary'' burden on parties' political-association rights under
the Constitution's First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ''A single election in which the party nominee is selected by
nonparty members could be enough to destroy the party,'' Scalia
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska and Washington state have similar ''blanket'' primaries
in which voters can choose nominees from the candidates of all
parties. For example, a voter could choose a Republican candidate
for governor, a Democrat for senator and a Libertarian for state
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said they were not deciding the validity of the
more common open primary system used in another 20 states. In such
systems, voters choose on election day which party's primary they
will vote in, and they can select among that party's candidates
only.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in dissent that he believed
Monday's ruling endangered those primary systems too.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is surely a danger that open primaries will fare no
better against a First Amendment challenge than blanket primaries
have,'' Stevens wrote in an opinion joined by Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   California GOP executive director Jon Fleischman said, ''We are
very pleased that the United States Supreme Court feels that our
members' right of association is paramount.''
</P>
<P>
   California Secretary of State Bill Jones countered, ''I don't
know who the parties are afraid of. The vast majority of their
members supported this'' blanket primary system.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Tobey, chairman of a California group supporting blanket
primaries, said supporters will try again to find a system that
will meet court approval.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia said states could hold a nonpartisan blanket primary, in
which voters can choose any candidate and the top two vote-getters
move on to the general election. Such a system would be similar to
Louisiana's voting system.
</P>
<P>
   Under such a voting plan, Scalia said, ''primary voters are not
choosing a party's nominee'' and therefore political parties'
rights are not harmed.
</P>
<P>
   His opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter,
Clarence Thomas and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Four California political parties -- including the Democrats,
Republicans, Libertarians and Peace and Freedom Party -- challenged
the blanket primary system overwhelmingly approved by the state's
voters in 1996. Until then, Californians could vote only in their
own party's primary.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ruled against the parties, and the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, saying the state had a substantial
interest in boosting voter turnout and giving voters a greater
choice. The Supreme Court reversed the 9th Circuit court.
</P>
<P>
   ''As for affording voters greater choice, it is obvious that the
net effect of this scheme ... is to reduce the scope of choice, by
assuring a range of candidates who are all more centrist,'' Scalia
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 24 states with open or blanket primaries, 13
states have closed primaries that allow only party members to vote
in each party's primary. Another 13 states have closed primaries
but also let independent voters cast ballots in at least one
party's primary.
</P>
<P>
   Among the friend-of-the-court advice the justices received was a
pro-blanket-primary brief from Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who
relied heavily on Democrats and independents in his losing campaign
for the Republican presidential nomination this year.

<HEADLINE> Prank Dismays Britney Spears Fans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- The disc jockey thought it was pretty
funny, but Britney Spears' fans weren't laughing.
</P>
<P>
   An announced appearance by the teen pop star prompted about 400
children and parents to line up outside WBHT-FM's studio. Their
hopes were shattered when a limousine pulled up and a tuxedo-clad
man emerged carrying a Britney Spears doll in a box.
</P>
<P>
   ''See, I told you she was a real doll to work with,'' disc
jockey Bill Fox told the crowd, according to parent Michelle Brady.
</P>
<P>
   Tears streamed down little girls' faces, parents cursed and
debris flew through the air. Brady said her 5-year-old daughter was
hit in the head with a bottle intended for Fox. She was not
seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ''My daughter's heart was broken,'' Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said listeners should have been able to ''read between the
lines'' and figure out that this joke was no different than any
other pranks the station has played.

<HEADLINE> FDA Opening OTC Drug Debate  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Envision powerful cholesterol-lowering drugs
sitting between the cough syrup and dental floss on store shelves --
no doctor's prescription required. Just toss a box of Mevacor or
Pravachol into the shopping cart and you're off.
</P>
<P>
   Is that a safe way to ward off a heart attack? And if the
government lets those cholesterol medicines start selling without a
prescription, what's next -- over-the-counter antibiotics or blood
pressure therapy or diabetes drugs?
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration this week begins debating major
changes in how it regulates over-the-counter drugs, and the fate of
Mevacor and Pravachol could signal whether a new wave of
nonprescription drugs is headed for a store near you.
</P>
<P>
   Cholesterol patients don't have the only stake. Consider the
allergy reliever Claritin. A prominent insurance company wants
Claritin to sell without a prescription like it does in Canada,
where a month's supply is about $17 instead of the $60, plus
doctor's fees, Americans pay.
</P>
<P>
   Money aside, Blue Cross of California argues nondrowsy Claritin
is safer than today's over-the-counter antihistamines that make
people sleepy, very dangerous if they're driving.
</P>
<P>
   But manufacturer Schering-Plough Corp. -- which is aggressively
lobbying Congress for patent extensions to preserve Claritin's
profits -- opposes selling nonprescription Claritin here. Can the
FDA, citing public safety, force the switch?
</P>
<P>
   They're serious dilemmas. On one side is better consumer access.
Prices usually drop when drugs move over the counter, and experts
say only a fraction of people who could benefit from nondrowsy
allergy relievers and powerful cholesterol drugs called ''statins''
use them.
</P>
<P>
   But critics question how you'd ever know without a doctor's exam
if simmering cholesterol was improving. Insurers seldom pay for
nonprescription drugs. Plus, if FDA forces Claritin over the
counter, it likely will wind up in court.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers are more interested in taking care of their own
health problems as much as they can,'' says Dr. Robert Delap, FDA's
chief of nonprescription drugs. ''We recognize that, and we're
reexamining ... what our policies should be.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate goes public Wednesday and Thursday, when the FDA
holds hearings in suburban Washington for consumers and advocacy
groups to voice opinions. (FDA also will accept written comments;
check http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/NEW00725.html).
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, far more drugs could be affected. What about blood
pressure medicines, or the ''morning after'' pill that women need
in a hurry to prevent pregnancy? Look ahead to vaginal
''microbicides'' that companies are rapidly developing to protect
against the AIDS virus, products many advocates argue will have to
be nonprescription to help poor women.
</P>
<P>
   But the statins and Claritin are the first FDA must decide. Next
month, FDA's independent scientific advisers will formally vote on
Mevacor and Pravachol's fate. No Claritin deadline has been set.
</P>
<P>
   The cholesterol decision is overdue, says industry consultant
Steve Francesco, noting Americans already can buy an unregulated
dietary supplement called Cholestin that contains Mevacor's active
ingredient. Plus, there are FDA-approved cholesterol-lowering
margarines.
</P>
<P>
   ''These drugs are vastly superior than some of the nutritionals
out there, and yet the nutritionals are being marketed to the
public and these drugs are not,'' contends Francesco.
</P>
<P>
   But Mevacor and Pravachol patients today must get blood tests
against a rare side effect, liver damage, that would be impossible
if they don't see a doctor, argues consumer advocate Dr. Sidney
Wolfe of Public Citizen.
</P>
<P>
   As for Claritin, the FDA worries that people use today's
nonprescription but sleep-inducing allergy relievers, such as
Benadryl, before getting behind the wheel. Worried enough to say
the nondrowsy competitors Claritin, Allegra or Zyrtec should be
nonprescription, too?
</P>
<P>
   Delap demurs, saying, ''We need to find a way to accomplish what
needs to happen for the public health. But there are some legal
issues here that I would not say I have the final word on.''
</P>
<P>
   Schering contends Claritin should remain prescription-only
because ''allergies are a complex and potentially serious disease
that requires a high level of medical care.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're talking about ... a runny nose,'' responds Blue Cross'
Robert Seidman, who petitioned FDA to force the change.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Miranda Warnings  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court gave new power to its
landmark Miranda decision of 1966, ruling police still must warn
the people they arrest of their ''right to remain silent'' when
questioned.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-2 ruling Monday resolved a bitter, 34-year debate over
criminal suspects' rights and the Supreme Court ruling many
Americans know best.
</P>
<P>
   ''Miranda has become embedded in routine police practice to the
point where the warnings have become part of our national
culture,'' Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   ''Miranda announced a constitutional rule that Congress may not
supersede legislatively,'' he said. ''We decline to overrule
Miranda ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, police still are required to give the warnings made
familiar to generations of Americans by movies and television or
else risk getting suspects' confessions excluded as evidence
against them.
</P>
<P>
   Suspects must be told that anything they say may be used against
them, they can remain silent or have a lawyer's help while
answering, and that a lawyer will be appointed to help them if they
cannot afford to hire one.
</P>
<P>
   The new decision delighted civil liberties groups and
disappointed some law enforcement organizations.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he was pleased the police warnings were
so ''resoundingly'' upheld. ''They have worked for law enforcement
by providing clear standards for our officers and they have worked
to protect the rights of our citizens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The court, far more liberal 34 years ago than it is now, sought
to remedy ''inherently coercive'' interrogations by creating
bright-line guidelines in its Miranda vs. Arizona decision. Courts
previously had used a ''totality-of-the-circumstances'' test to
determine whether a confession or incriminating statement had been
given to police voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution's Fifth Amendment says, ''No person ... shall
be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court last year threw the future of those
warnings into doubt, ruling that Congress in effect overturned the
Miranda decision by enacting a long-ignored 1968 law known as
Section 3501.
</P>
<P>
   That law purports to return the law, at least in federal cases,
to pre-Miranda days. It says ''the presence or absence'' of any
factor such as a Miranda warning ''need not be conclusive on the
issue of voluntariness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that
the warnings imposed on police by the Miranda decision were never
constitutionally mandated.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision said the appeals court wrongly ignored the
length of time Miranda has been around and the dozens of follow-up
Supreme Court decisions it spawned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether or not we would agree with Miranda's reasoning and its
resulting rule were we addressing the issue in the first
instance,'' its age and those other precedents ''weigh heavily
against overruling it now,'' Rehnquist said.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Shapiro of the American Civil Liberties Union praised the
court for upholding the Miranda ruling, which he called ''an emblem
of fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Doing away with the police warnings would have sent a terrible
message about our criminal justice system, that effective law
enforcement depends on keeping people ignorant of their rights,''
Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   But a disappointed Robert Scully of the National Association of
Police Organizations called the Miranda ruling ''a vehicle inviting
routine efforts to exclude voluntary confessions,'' and predicted
that Monday's decision ''will only increase the amount of
litigation on this point in state and federal courts.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This case was not about whether giving the warnings made good
public policy, which many law enforcement officers support,''
Scully said. ''Rather, it was about the automatic exclusion of
incriminating statements if there was a technical violation of the
Miranda guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices Antonin Scalia wrote a scathing dissent, in which
Justice Clarence Thomas joined.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia accused Rehnquist, a frequent past critic of the Miranda
ruling, and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy of
turning their backs on previous rulings in which they had
questioned the constitutional underpinnings of the 1966 decision.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia said Monday's ruling stopped short of saying police
questioning without Miranda warnings violates the Constitution
''because a majority of the court does not believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit court invoked the 1968 law in the case of a
Maryland man accused of robbing banks in Maryland and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dickerson of Takoma Park, Md., reportedly made several
incriminating statements to FBI agents after being arrested and
charged with seven bank robberies. He says the agents did not give
him a proper Miranda warning, a claim that was not challenged in
lower courts.

<HEADLINE> $1.9 Trillion Surplus Predicted  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Monday he wants to use
the staggering surpluses now forecast in the federal budget to pay
off the national debt by 2012, and offered a bargain to
congressional Republicans to end the so-called ''marriage
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House estimates the total surpluses at $1.87 trillion
over the next 10 years. Announcement of the new estimate -- which is
more than double the $746 billion forecast just four months ago --
pours massive new sums of money into this year's budget fight and
roils this year's presidential and congressional election
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to spend part of the surplus to pay for
prescription drugs for the elderly -- a benefit currently lacking
under the federal Medicare program. The White House and
congressional Republicans have competing plans to pay for a drug
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans also differ over how to end the tax
disparity for married couples, who often pay more than if they
filed individually.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he called congressional GOP leaders Monday to offer
this deal:
</P>
<P>
   ''If Congress will pass a plan to that gives real voluntary
Medicare prescription drug coverage, available and affordable to
all seniors consistent with the principles of my plan, ... then I
will sign a marriage penalty relief law,'' Clinton said. Each
initiative would cost about $250 billion over 10 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a proposal for true compromise that asks each party to
accept some of the positions of the other party in the name of
progress,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to save the entire Social Security surplus of $2.3
trillion over 10 years and devote it to paying down the public
debt.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he proposes to save the entire Medicare surplus of
$403 billion over 10 years and devote that to debt reduction as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ''A 6-year-old today ... is living in an America that is 3.5
trillion dollars in debt,'' Clinton said during a Rose Garden
appearance. ''We can eliminate that debt by the time that child
enters college.
</P>
<P>
   ''Twelve years from now people from my generation will be
entering retirement knowing that Social Security and Medicare will
be there for them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Quite simply, an economic plan that invests in our people, and
pays down the debt, is the wisest choice we can make to honor our
values and ensure a better future for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also proposed setting aside some of the money for a
10-year, $500 billion ''reserve for America's future'' that could
be used for debt reduction, tax cuts, buttressing peoples'
retirement plans or whatever else lawmakers decided.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's dramatically bigger surplus forecast has been expected
for weeks, thanks to the huge piles of revenue the robust economy
has generated for the federal government. Nonetheless, the
mountains of projected cash were infusing a new uncertainty into
election-year politics.
</P>
<P>
   The extra money could make it easier for the two sides to strike
a wide-ranging budget deal on taxes and spending, though the
temptation remains for many members of both parties to leave major
conflicts unresolved so they can trumpet their differences during
this fall's campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   John Feehery, spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., said: ''These numbers are the result of the fiscal
responsibility of the Republican Congress, and it would be a
mistake to throw that responsibility overboard by an aggressive new
spending plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The new $1.87 trillion 10-year surplus projection excluded
Social Security. It represents the part of the surplus politicians
feel free to use for spending or for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   With Social Security's own surpluses included, the overall
10-year black ink was being projected at $4.19 trillion, a
Democratic official said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's enriched proposal for a new prescription drug benefit
under Medicare will have a 10-year, $255 billion price tag, $60
billion bigger than his last plan and far bigger than a competing
House GOP package.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the publicly held portion of the national debt by
2012 would be a year earlier than Clinton proposed in February.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $5.7 trillion national debt, Clinton would eliminate the
$3.5 trillion part of it held by the public. The remaining $2.2
trillion is money the government owes its own trust funds for
Social Security and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore wants a $500 billion tax cut and more
spending for Social Security, health, schools and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the presumed Republican nominee for president,
wants to use $1.3 trillion of the surplus for a tax cut and more of
it for debt reduction and shoring up Social Security.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors: no charges warranted in woman's death during hoax  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) - Prosecutors said Monday that they will
not file criminal charges in connection with a radio station's
faked appearance by Britney Spears that resulted in a woman's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the death June 14 of Susan E. Santodonato, 37,
was an accident. Investigators had expressed concern that someone
might have pushed Santodonato.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 people gathered for the Britney Spears promotion
at Endwell radio station WMRV-FM STAR 105.7. The advertised on-air
interview and appearance turned out to be a hoax. The interview was
prerecorded, and the pop music star proved to be a Spears
look-alike, with bodyguards and a limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Santodonato went to the station with her 11-year-old daughter,
Andrea, and an adult friend and her daughter, to catch a glimpse of
the rock star.
</P>
<P>
   Santodonato fell in the parking lot and struck her head. She
died the next day at Wilson Memorial Regional Medical Center in
Johnson City. The blow to the head caused a cardiac arrhythmia, an
abnormal heartbeat, that led to her death, an autopsy showed.
</P>
<P>
   In Wilkes-Barre, Pa., radio station WBHT-FM also staged a fake
Britney Spears appearance. About 400 fans watched a limousine pull
up Friday and a tuxedo-clad man got out carrying a Spears doll in a
box.
</P>
<P>
   ''See, I told you she was a real doll to work with,'' disc
jockey Bill Fox told the crowd, according to parent Michelle Brady.
</P>
<P>
   When Britney turned out to be a toy, tears streamed down little
girls' faces, parents cursed and debris flew through the air.
Brady's 5-year-old daughter was struck in the head with a glass
bottle that Brady believed was intended for Fox. She was not
seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The radio station did not immediately return a call seeking
comment.

<HEADLINE> Court: Only Juries Can Decide Motive  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Juries, not judges, must decide whether
someone charged with a hate crime was motivated by bias and
therefore can be given a higher maximum sentence, the Supreme Court
ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 decision overturns a 12-year prison sentence imposed on
a white New Jersey man who fired shots into a black family's home.
The man is entitled to a jury trial on whether he acted out of
racial bias, the justices said.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens said the case
was a question of procedure. The justices previously ruled that any
factor, except for a prior conviction, ''that increases the maximum
penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to
a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The New Jersey procedure challenged in this case is an
unacceptable departure from the jury tradition that is an
indispensable part of our criminal justice system,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all states have some type of hate-crime law, although
many already specify that a jury, not a judge, must decide whether
a defendant was motivated by bias.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the justices ruled unanimously in a case
involving five members of the Branch Davidian cult that a jury, not
a judge, must decide whether people deserve extra punishment for
using a machine gun during their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Levin, a California State University law professor who
filed a friend-of-the-court brief for a group of human-rights
organizations, said the decision's ''real effect will be on
legislatures to restructure individual offenses with higher maximum
penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey was one of the first states to adopt a hate-crime
law, in 1981. It bans acts of racial or ethnic intimidation, such
as burning crosses or painting swastikas.
</P>
<P>
   The law was expanded in 1990 to provide stiffer sentences for
such common crimes as assault and harassment if the defendant acted
with a ''purpose to intimidate'' because of factors such as race,
sex or religion.
</P>
<P>
   Charles C. Apprendi Jr. was arrested in December 1994 after
eight shots were fired into the home of a black family living in
his otherwise all-white neighborhood in Vineland, N.J. No one was
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi admitted the shooting, and at first he told police he
wanted to send a message to the black family that they did not
belong in the neighborhood. Later, he said he was pressured into
making a false statement, and that he had no racial intent but
fired into the house when its purple front door caught his eye.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi pleaded guilty to a firearm violation and possessing a
bomb in his house, which carried a maximum 10-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors sought a longer term under the hate-crime law. The
judge imposed a 12-year sentence, saying prosecutors showed by a
''preponderance of the evidence'' that Apprendi's act was racially
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi contended such decisions must be made by a jury using
the highest legal standard -- whether prosecutors offered proof
beyond a reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
   But the state's lawyers said the hate-crime law punished motive,
which traditionally is a sentencing issue to be decided by the
judge.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled against Apprendi and upheld
his sentence. On Monday, the nation's highest court reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens noted that the jury convicted Apprendi of an offense
with a maximum 10-year penalty, adding that the effect of the
''sentencing enhancement here is unquestionably to turn a
second-degree offense into a first-degree offense, under the
state's own criminal code.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' opinion was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, David H.
Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Sandra Day O'Connor, Stephen G. Breyer and Anthony M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the four, O'Connor said, ''Our court has long
recognized that not every fact that bears on a defendant's
punishment need be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury
and proved by the government beyond a reasonable doubt.'' Instead,
she said, legislatures can define the elements of an offense.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Apprendi vs. New Jersey, 99-478.

<HEADLINE> Surgery May Avoid Hysterectomies  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) -- A Dutch doctor has developed a new method
of uterine surgery that early tests indicate is safer and simpler
than the current one and could avoid thousands of hysterectomies.
</P>
<P>
   The method commonly used to cut out non-cancerous growths,
resectoscopy, carries the risk of dangerous side effects, including
swelling of the brain and death. Concern over the complications
prompts many doctors to remove the whole uterus.
</P>
<P>
   The new technique, which cuts tissue with a rotating blade
encased in a wand, then sucks it up a tube, has been tested on 30
women and safely and easily solved their problems while leaving
their fertility intact.
</P>
<P>
   The method was presented Monday at the European Society of Human
Reproduction and Embryology.
</P>
<P>
   Its developer, Dr. Mark Emanuel from Spaarne Hospital in
Haarlem, the Netherlands, said the technique would help women whose
growths -- fibroids or polyps -- are on the inside surface of the
womb in a place that is accessible to an instrument inserted
through the cervix.
</P>
<P>
   That would amount to about 25 percent of women with fibroids,
the more common type of growth. Polyps are classed together with
other menstrual problems, so the population of women that could be
helped was not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Fibroids are formed from cells in the uterine muscle, while
polyps are made of cells from the lining. They can cause
debilitating symptoms, including heavy bleeding and painful cramps,
miscarriage and other fertility problems.
</P>
<P>
   About 670,000 hysterectomies are performed each year in the
United States, about a third for fibroids.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of my colleagues fear the resectoscopy. They think it's
too difficult,'' Emanuel said of the technique, which uses a wire
loop electrode to cut out the growths.
</P>
<P>
   At least two other alternatives have been developed but they are
either too slow or vaporize the growths, leaving no tissue to
examine. And they both use electric currents, which could go
through the wall of the uterus and damage organs such as the
bladder, said Dr. Elizabeth Stewart, clinical director of the
Center for Uterine Fibroids at Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The method used varies greatly across different areas, she said.
In most large hospitals, women are offered some kind of alternative
to hysterectomy. But while the electric wire approach requires
special training, all gynecologists know how to perform a
hysterectomy, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This sounds like a new option. We'd like to get faster and
easier treatment with these (growths),'' said Stewart, who was not
connected with the Dutch work. ''It sounds as though it may be
easier. The innovation with this is it doesn't use electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   A major problem with resectoscopy is that because it uses an
electric wire to cut the tissue, the uterus must be inflated with a
liquid that does not conduct electricity so that the electrical
current stays focused on the tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Such fluids contain no salt, which is essential to the body but
conducts electricity. The liquid used in resectoscopy dilutes the
blood's salt concentration, which can lead to swelling of the lungs
and brain cells, seizures and sometimes death.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors can give the women salt to restore the balance, but the
right amount is difficult to measure during the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel's method uses saline solution to inflate the womb.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the average gynecologist, it's a technique that makes it
easier to remove uterine tissue,'' Emanuel said.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Clinton hits campaign trail with Mom  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton had a surprise guest
Monday when she held a news conference about the plight of 13
Iranian Jews accused of spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea Clinton joined her mother and a bevy of elected
officials and Jewish leaders at the City Hall news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The first daughter gave no speech but said she would participate
''on and off'' in her mother's campaign for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's going to be coming and going as she chooses,'' Hillary
Clinton said. ''I believe in permitting her to make those
decisions. You'll be seeing her sometimes, which will be a delight
for me, and that's all I can tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea Clinton rode along briefly with her mother's listening
tour last year but hadn't been seen on the campaign trail since.
</P>
<P>
   She smiled shyly, shook hands with reporters and playfully
fanned one of her mother's aides. She greeted a little girl before
kissing her mother goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton went on to attend a meeting with State Assembly
Speaker Sheldon Silver.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference was to announce Clinton's support for a
worldwide petition drive to free the Iranian Jews, who may face the
death penalty if they are convicted of spying.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Republican Senate opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, is
helping to collect signatures in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an issue above politics,'' said Malcolm Hoenlein, a
leader of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish
Organizations. ''Just as Vice President Gore and George Bush have
spoken out for the 13, as Rick Lazio and the first lady are
speaking out for the 13, this is not an issue that should be
rendered into the political debate.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Clinton's second news conference on the steps of City
Hall in five days.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani did not attend, but he has previously
spoken out on behalf of the Iranian Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton still had her daughter on her mind when she spoke later
Monday at the commencement for Forest Hills High School in Queens,
which was held in the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   She told the 600 graduates and their families, ''When Chelsea
graduated from high school, I certainly remember sitting there in
the audience as so many parents and proud relatives are today. It
was just as much a rite of passage for Bill and me as it is for all
of you, because you as parents are entering a new stage of life as
well with this important step by these young men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reiterated campaign proposals for making college tuition
tax deductible and providing college scholarships to students who
agree to teach in underserved public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson
confirmed a report in the New York Post that the first lady would
attend a fund-raising luncheon for her campaign Friday at the Park
Avenue home of retired insurance executive Walter Kaye.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye, a friend of Monica Lewinsky's mother, recommended Lewinsky
for the White House internship that led to her sexual relationship
with the president.

<HEADLINE> FAA Giving Airports Safety System  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new ground safety system to help prevent
runway collisions will be provided to 25 airports across the
country, the Federal Aviation Administration said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The system, called ASDE-X is designed to give air traffic
controllers information about the location of planes and vehicles
at night and in bad weather when visibility is limited.
</P>
<P>
   ASDE-X is similar to the ASDE-3 ground surveillance radar now
providing similar data to controllers at the nation's 34 busiest
airports. The new units will provide added protection to 25
smaller, less busy fields, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   FAA Administrator Jane Garvey announced the decision to purchase
the equipment at the opening of a three-day airport safety
conference in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The 34 busiest airports are scheduled to be upgraded by 2002 to
a more complex system that will provide warnings of potential
collisions in addition to informing controllers of the locations of
aircraft and vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey said the FAA plans to award a contract for production of
ASDE-X in September. She said the 25 airports that will get ASDE-X
were selected through a safety risk assessment conducted by the FAA
and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which focused on
potential accidents and fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   The number and rate of close calls on runways increased during
most of the last decade before dropping slightly last year.
However, the number of incidents jumped 27 percent in the first
five months of this year compared with the corresponding period in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The runway safety summit is serving as a forum to discuss
results of a series of regional runway safety meetings held earlier
this year by the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 airports slated to get the new equipment are --
</P>
<P>
   Arizona -- Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   California -- Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena, Oakland Metropolitan,
Ontario, Orange County (John Wayne), Sacramento, San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado -- Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut -- Windsor Locks (Bradley International Airport).
</P>
<P>
   Florida -- Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii -- Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois -- Chicago Midway.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana -- Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada -- Reno.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Committees approve new budget without dissent, laying ground for easy final votes </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Senate and Assembly committees approved the
proposed $21.5 billion state budget Monday with little dissent and
no controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democrat on the Assembly budget committee, Barbara
Buono, D-Middlesex, complained that too little is being done in
times of such rich revenues to ease the burdens on middle-class
families who face high property taxes and increasing college
tuitions.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Buono referred to the spending total -
up 10 percent from the budget signed 12 months ago - as
''unimaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Buono and her Democratic colleagues on the committee
promptly voted ''yes,'' joining the sponsoring Republicans to
approve the budget 11-0. The Senate budget committee did the same,
8-0.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's vote outcomes forecast that overall approval was
virtually certain on Thursday with votes to spare. If a large bloc
of Democrats or, for that member, a fringe group of Republicans had
intended to raise a major objection to a core budget item, it would
likely have surfaced during Monday's committee action.
</P>
<P>
   The budget bill appropriates $21.48 billion and also takes in
and dispenses $8 billion in federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Amendments to the budget Thursday would be tricky but are
possible. After that, the budget goes to Gov. Christie Whitman's
desk.
</P>
<P>
   The governor will have until midnight Friday to announce any
line-item vetoes of individual budget appropriations - she is one
of the few chief executives in the United States with this
authority - and then sign it into law in time for the new 2000-2001
fiscal year that begins at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 138; Nasadaq Adds 67  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip Morris drove the Dow Jones industrial
average to its biggest gain in more than three weeks Monday as
investors applauded the company's plan to acquire the snack food
business Nabisco Holdings Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, one of several mergers the market reacted to Monday,
boosted investors' enthusiasm and helped many take their focus off
the Federal Reserve's meeting this week.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary calculations, the Dow average rose
138.24 to close at 10,542.99, its largest point gain since June 2.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 13.83 at 1,455.31, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 66.71 at 3,912.05.
</P>
<P>
   Dow component Philip Morris rose $3.375 to $27 in the first
trading session since the Sunday announcement of its proposed
purchase of Nabisco for $14.9 billion plus the assumption of $4
billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Once the deal is completed, Philip Morris plans to begin work on
an initial public offering of up to 15 percent of the stock in the
newly combined food company. Philip Morris owns Kraft Foods and
Nabisco Holdings makes Ritz crackers, Snackwell's snacks, Oreo
cookies and Life Savers candy.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, which comes amid a flurry of consolidation in the
food industry, also boosted the broader market, said Alan Ackerman,
senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ''It energizes the market,'' he said. ''And it gets massive
amounts of cash flowing through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading was fairly light as investors looked ahead to the Fed's
impending decision on interest rates, to be announced on Wednesday.
Most economists believe the Fed will leave rates unchanged, sensing
that six rate increases in the past year are successfully slowing
the economy to a more sustainable pace.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have less than one week left before the end of the quarter,
and it appears that some people are willing to put funds to work
now based on the fact that the Fed may leave rates unchanged,''
Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which benefit from stable interest rates, led
the blue-chip Dow higher Monday. J.P. Morgan rose $1.375 to
$118.625 and Citigroup rose $2.125 to $63.813.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson added to the Dow's strength, rising $5 to
$94.75. PaineWebber analyst David Lothson raised his rating on the
stock to ''buy'' from ''neutral,'' saying the company's solid
earnings growth makes it a good investment should interest rates
continue rising.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts remain unsure that the Fed will leave rates
untouched this week. John H. Shaughnessy, chief investment
strategist at Advest Inc., said the Fed may opt for one more
quarter-percentage point increase before ending its long cycle of
rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their motivation to raise rates now in the face of obvious
economic slowing may be to keep the stock market from rising
sharply,'' he said. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has been critical
of the ''wealth effect,'' in which the escalating stock market has
fueled rampant consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks mounted a modest recovery from last week's
selloff, but investors were focusing on the strongest,
best-capitalized companies. Oracle rose $2.438 to $81.938 and Sun
Microsystems rose $4.188 to $90.75.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, a merger in the online retailing sector did nothing
to stimulate investors' enthusiasm. Webvan Group, which is buying
HomeGrocer.com, tumbled $1.25 to $7.469, while HomeGrocer dropped
$1.063 to $7.031, both on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume of 883.5 million shares, up
from 844.7 million Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.54 to 510.95.

<HEADLINE> Colorblindness Gene Identified  </HEADLINE>
By MALCOLM RITTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have identified the defective gene that causes a
debilitating total colorblindness among many inhabitants of a tiny
Pacific island.
</P>
<P>
   The neurologist Oliver Sacks described the condition in the 1997
book ''The Island of the Colorblind.'' The afflicted islanders see
the world as if watching it on a black-and-white television.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the defective gene ends a 30-year search.
Researchers said it will not lead to a treatment immediately but
might help find one eventually.
</P>
<P>
   It could also lead to a test to tell islanders with normal
vision whether they carry a flawed copy of the gene that would
raise their children's risk of colorblindness. The disorder appears
only in people who inherit a flawed copy from each parent.
</P>
<P>
   The island, Pingelap, is part of the Federated States of
Micronesia. Of the 3,000 Pingelapese, some of whom live on nearby
islands, about one in 20 is totally colorblind. That compares with
a worldwide rate of one in 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The flawed gene has been traced back to one man, who was among
20 survivors of a typhoon on Pingelap around 1775 who went on to
re-establish the population.
</P>
<P>
   The condition differs from the relatively common colorblindness
in which people cannot distinguish certain colors. Affected people
on the island cannot see colors at all. They lack the sharp vision
most people use to read, and their eyes are overwhelmed by sunlight
-- a particularly severe problem in the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Sacks noted that some affected islanders found work
fishing by night.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're about as handicapped as you can be,'' said Dr. Irene
Hussels Maumenee, a member of the research team that first formally
described the condition on Pingelap in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ''They stay in the cabin all day. They just don't see when they
go out in the sunlight,'' said Maumenee, a professor of
ophthalmology and pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins University School
of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Their difficulty in reading hampers their schoolwork, and
''people consider them very much as an outcast,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She is senior author of the paper announcing the finding of the
gene, which appears in the July issue of the journal Nature
Genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Total colorblindness is called complete achromatopsia. One other
flawed gene for the condition had been identified before, but it
clearly was not responsible for the problem on Pingelap.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery is ''a really exciting result,'' said Maureen
Neitz, who studies the genetics of colorblindness at the Medical
College of Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> School burns hours after classes let out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAKE LUZERNE, N.Y. (AP) - Two 15-year-olds students were charged
with arson after setting fire to their middle school hours after
school let out Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was started with a cigarette lighter taken to a
cardboard box near the greenhouse at Stuart M. Townsend Middle
School. It caused an estimated $600,000 to $1 million dollars worth
of damage.
</P>
<P>
   Both boys were charged with being juvenile delinquents. Were
they adults, police said, they would have faced felony arson
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Several fire companies responded to the blaze, which damaged the
rear of the school. The rest of the school was damaged by water and
smoke. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said they don't know if the school will be open
in time for summer classes that start next week.

<HEADLINE> Cops Near Identifying Truck Victims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Police investigators said Monday they were close
to identifying 29 of the 58 Chinese illegal immigrants found
suffocated in the airtight compartment of a truck in the British
port of Dover.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they would not name the victims, found by
customs officials on June 18, until all had been identified and
their families had been contacted.
</P>
<P>
   Police Supt. Dennis McGookin said detectives had made
''significant advances'' in identifying some of the victims, after
consulting with Britain's Immigration Service and with authorities
in Belgium and the Netherlands, where the truck originated.
</P>
<P>
   Several police officers from China's Fujian province were to
visit London later this week, which ''should also be of great
assistance,'' McGookin said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the victims -- 54 men and four women -- apparently came
from the southern Chinese province, which is notorious for
human-trafficking gangs, dubbed ''snakeheads.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese died after the sealed vehicle began a five-hour boat
crossing from the Netherlands to Dover. Of the 60 people inside the
truck's compartment, only two survived.
</P>
<P>
   An inquest heard how an air vent on the side of the metal
container had been closed during the ferry crossing, cutting off
the only source of oxygen. The victims banged on the compartment's
walls with their shoes, but were never answered.
</P>
<P>
   The truck's Dutch driver, Perry Walker, 32, from Rotterdam, has
been charged with 58 counts of manslaughter. He remains in police
custody and is due in court Friday, along with two Chinese suspects
based in London.
</P>
<P>
   You Yi, 38, and Ying Guo, 29, were in police custody under
charges of conspiracy to smuggle illegal immigrants into Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch police brought the 24-year-old truck company owner,
identified earlier as Arie van der Spek, to a court in the
Netherlands on Friday on charges of illegal trafficking of aliens.
</P>
<P>
   The two men who survived the ordeal were under police guard at a
safe house. They have been working with police to identify the
others, but have not yet applied for asylum, a police spokeswoman
said.

<HEADLINE> Syria Lawmaker Balks on Age Issue  </HEADLINE>
By HAMZA HENDAWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- A parliament meeting to affirm Bashar
Assad's nomination for president departed from its carefully
scripted course Monday when a lawmaker said a procedural error had
been made in lowering the minimum age of a president to match that
of the 34-year-old son of Syria's late leader.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmaker, Monzir Moussali, said the constitutional amendment
to lower the minimum age from 40 to 34 did not cite the reasons for
the change, which was adopted hours after President Hafez Assad
died June 10.
</P>
<P>
   The objection apparently was unexpected, and other deputies
tried to shout Moussali down. Parliament Speaker Abdul-Qader
Qadoura said the error was not intentional and abruptly closed the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Moussali, who apologized when he was given the floor nearly
three hours after he first spoke, pleaded that his emotional
outburst be forgiven and declared his unwavering support for Bashar
Assad's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stand by my point, but several parties ... have described me
as an opposition member in the assembly,'' he said. ''In this
country and in this assembly, our only opposition is to imperialism
and its conspiracies against our country. We are all in one trench
and follow the same path.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Qadoura responded: ''Your apology is a sign of respect
for this institution and a confession that you have erred.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's debate was in response to the nomination of Bashar
Assad for president by the ruling Baath party, which dominates the
250-seat rubber-stamp parliament. A report by a 70-deputy committee
set up Sunday to study the nomination said it had unanimously
approved it.
</P>
<P>
   The entire house had been expected to vote Monday evening on the
nomination and set a date for the referendum, but more than four
hours after the session began, only 64 deputies of 200 requesting
time had spoken.
</P>
<P>
   Qadoura adjourned the session until Tuesday morning. He urged
legislators to be brief in their speeches Tuesday, saying there
would be no evening session.
</P>
<P>
   In flowery language, many of the Syrian legislators who spoke
Monday evening lavishly praised the late Syrian leader and his son.
One deputy was close to tears as he catalogued some of the elder
Assad's achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Khalaf al-Ali called Bashar Assad ''one of God's
beloved,'' and appealed to him, ''Lead us as you learned at the
school of the great Assad.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow legislator Abdullah Zoabi played on the Assad family
name, which means ''lion'' in Arabic: ''Our hope is in this cub,
the Bashar of goodness, victory and prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand Syrians, mostly young people, gathered outside
the parliament building, carrying posters of Bashar Assad and
chanting ''Bashar forever'' and ''Only God, Syria and Bashar.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country where security agencies are known to have eyes and
ears everywhere, everyone is expected to toe the official line. In
this case, the line is that Bashar Assad, a political novice and a
former eye doctor, is the person best suited to carry on the
policies his father pursued during 30 years in power.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum is expected during the first week of July, and
Bashar Assad most likely will be the only candidate. Voters will be
given only the option of marking ''yes'' or ''no'' on their
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Long used to being told what to do by a state that brooks little
dissent, voters were expected to back Bashar Assad overwhelmingly.
The elder Assad consistently won presidential referenda with more
than 90 percent -- sometimes as high as 99.99 percent -- ''yes''
votes.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that Bashar Assad does not enjoy some real
popularity. He probably does, especially among young Syrians who
hope he will open up society and embark on economic reform.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Hosts NBA Draft  </HEADLINE>
By JASON WOLF
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- For a few hours on Wednesday night, Minnesota
will be the center of the basketball universe, mostly because
executives of the NBA's 29 teams will be at Target Center for the
draft.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also two likely first-round draft picks, both
underclassmen, who honed their skills on basketball courts in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Center Joel Przybilla, a Monticello native, is expected to be a
lottery pick. Connecticut guard Khalid El-Amin, who led Minneapolis
North to three straight prep championships, is another first-round
prospect, although he could slip to the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Przybilla was suspended by Minnesota coach Dan Monson a day
after being chosen the Big Ten's Player of the Week for his
career-best 33-point, 14-rebound effort in a 77-75 upset of Indiana
in February. Przybilla, who averaged 14.2 points and 8.4 rebounds
during his abbreviated sophomore season, never returned to the
team. He cited a poor relationship with Monson as the reason he
quit in midseason.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-foot-1 Przybilla is one of the few legitimate
shot-blocking centers to come out of college in years. Although his
offensive skills are suspect, Przybilla said his shooting improved
after he spent several months in northern California working on his
game during the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I decided to leave (Minnesota), a lot of people doubted
me,'' he said. ''But I've worked really hard. I've worked a lot on
my offensive game. I've gotten tons of shots in.''
</P>
<P>
   Przybilla took a beating from fans who chided him for abandoning
his teammates in midseason, but he said he's learned from the
experience and is ready to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think about it a lot, but I've moved on from it,'' Przybilla
said. ''I learned from it that I've got to look into things more
deeply and see what the consequences are. I'm satisfied with my
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Przybilla said representatives from each of the eight teams he
worked out for asked him about the circumstances surrounding his
decision to leave the Gophers.
</P>
<P>
   ''They know I've learned from it. They see how much I've
improved and how dedicated I am,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Przybilla said he plans to continue working out after
the draft, he said Wednesday is a day to relax and reflect on his
basketball career -- and the role he's playing in elevating
Minnesota prep basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hardly anyone used to go Division I. Now you get 10, 15 kids a
year. It's become a big part of people's lives,'' he said. ''I'm
really excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin, who won a national championship with the Huskies in
1999, said he left Connecticut after his junior year to meet family
obligations, such as taking care of his two young sons.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin is confident he'll be able to adjust to the bruising,
physical play in the NBA, despite his stout 5-10 frame.
</P>
<P>
   ''That has been the knock on me my whole career and I've proved
the critics wrong so far and I just look forward to the challenge
of keeping on proving them wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun said El-Amin's intangible
qualities, such as his winning approach and leadership skills, will
help him succeed at the pro level.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has an incredibly competitive heart,'' Calhoun said. ''I am
supremely confident in his ability to play in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin said he's not only excited that he'll be drafted in
front of scores of friends, family members and fans, but he's also
excited about being part of a showcase of Minnesota basketball
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was coming up, (Minnesota) wasn't really considered a
hotbed of basketball,'' he said. ''Now there are a lot of
up-and-coming players. Hopefully that shows that basketball in the
state is continuing to get better.''

senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ''It energizes the market,'' he said. ''And it gets massive
amounts of cash flowing through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading was fairly light as investors looked ahead to the Fed's
impending decision on interest rates, to be announced on Wednesday.
Most economists believe the Fed will leave rates unchanged, sensing
that six rate increases in the past year are successfully slowing
the economy to a more sustainable pace.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have less than one week left before the end of the quarter,
and it appears that some people are willing to put funds to work
now based on the fact that the Fed may leave rates unchanged,''
Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which benefit from stable interest rates, led
the blue-chip Dow higher Monday. J.P. Morgan rose $1.188 to
$118.438 and Citigroup rose $2.438 to $64.125.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson added to the Dow's strength, rising $5.75 to
$95.50. PaineWebber analyst David Lothson raised his rating on the
stock to ''buy'' from ''neutral,'' saying the company's solid
earnings growth makes it a good investment should interest rates
continue rising.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts remain unsure that the Fed will leave rates
untouched this week. John H. Shaughnessy, chief investment
strategist at Advest Inc., said the Fed may opt for one more
quarter-percentage point increase before ending its long cycle of
rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their motivation to raise rates now in the face of obvious
economic slowing may be to keep the stock market from rising
sharply,'' he said. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has been critical
of the ''wealth effect,'' in which the escalating stock market has
fueled rampant consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks mounted a modest recovery from last week's
selloff, but investors were focusing on the strongest,
best-capitalized companies. Oracle rose $3.188 to $82.688 and Sun
Microsystems rose $3.875 to $90.438.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, a merger in the online retailing sector did nothing
to stimulate investors' enthusiasm. Webvan Group, which is buying
HomeGrocer.com, tumbled $1.406 to $7.313, while HomeGrocer dropped
$1.219 to $6.875, both on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 883.5 million shares,
up from 844.7 million Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.94 to 516.35.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.2 percent.
Germany's DAX index rose 0.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 gained
0.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 0.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tamil Suicide Cadres Attack Ship  </HEADLINE>
By DILIP GANGULY
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Tamil rebels on Monday carried out a
suicide attack, ramming a power boat into a ship carrying food and
other items to soldiers and civilians in Jaffna. The rebels said 16
people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Casualty reports after the attack were conflicting. Authorities
said Sri Lankan navy boats rescued 21 of the 28 crew members, who
abandoned ship when the rebels attacked. They said seven crew
members were missing.
</P>
<P>
   But the guerrillas said in a statement that at least 16 people
were killed in the assault, including six rebel fighters and at
least 10 people aboard the ship. Neither side's reports could not
be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, called the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, said
they attacked the ship because it was carrying arms and ammunition
to the Sri Lankan army.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have been fighting government troops on the northern
Jaffna peninsula to carve out a homeland for minority Tamils, who
they say are discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese. The
17-year-old conflict has left more than 62,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   The suicide cadres attacked the Colombo-registered M.V. Mercs
Uhana early Monday as the ship tried to anchor off Point Pedro,
state spokesman Ariya Rubasinghe said.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,850-ton ship was carrying food, cement and other supplies
from the capital, Colombo, for the 40,000 troops stationed on
Jaffna. Some of the food was also meant for 500,000 civilians
trapped in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   A navy officer, who could not be identified under standing
regulations, said a rebel boat fitted with a powerful outboard
motor first fired mortars at the ship and then rammed it, exploding
itself. The ship caught fire and started sinking, forcing the crew
to abandon the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel boat was completely destroyed, the naval officer said.
He could not say how many rebels were on board.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have a naval unit made up of small, fast boats that
patrol the island's northern coast to secure supply routes and
attack government vessels in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The port at Point Pedro can be targeted by rebel boats, which
have an almost uninterrupted stretch of water to travel along the
Mullaittivu seaboard. Most areas along this shore are held by the
militants, and Mullaittivu serves as the main rebel base.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have targeted ships in the past, saying they do not
recognize Sri Lanka's sovereignty in northern and eastern waters.
They also have promised to attack any ship exporting items from the
north or the east.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the rebels sunk the 60,000-ton M.V. Cordiality, owned
by the China Ocean Shipping Co. of Hong Kong. Last year, the rebels
hijacked Princess Cash, a ship owned by a Dubai-based company
carrying 6,000 tons of cargo -- mostly cement, steel and other
building material to Jaffna city.

<HEADLINE> Israel Assures US on China Sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel takes ''seriously'' U.S. concerns about
the pending sale of an advanced airborne radar system to China,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's sale of the PHALCON caused a rare falling out last
week, when conservative U.S. congressmen proposed slashing $250
million from the nearly $2.8 billion Israel receives in U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
   A Barak aide, Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh, suggested
that Israel make up the difference by spending $250 million at home
instead of on U.S. defense suppliers. Israel plows much of the
defense aid money back into the U.S. economy by purchasing U.S.
products.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted charges from leading congressmen -- notably Jesse
Helms, a North Carolina Republican who chairs the Senate's powerful
Foreign Relations Committee -- that Israel was taking its alliance
with the United States lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prime minister's office wishes to clarify that Israel
takes the concerns of the United States regarding the sale of the
PHALCON plane to China very seriously,'' a statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is concerned that China could use the
technology in its efforts to intimidate Taiwan, and that the radar
could conceivably track U.S. planes in a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel places great importance on its strategic ties with the
United States,'' Barak's office said. ''Israel does not have, nor
has it ever had, any intention to hurt the essential interests of
the United States.''

<HEADLINE> Drug Adviser: Andro To Be a Steroid  </HEADLINE>
By OWEN S. GOOD
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- President Clinton's top drug policy
adviser said Monday the muscle-building supplement that Mark
McGwire made famous should be classified as a steroid ''within a
few months.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got to do something about andro,'' Barry McCaffrey said
in a speech to the Citizenship Through Sports Alliance. ''I've got
to get valid testing completed, and I bet that's the way it comes
out: that andro is a steroid.''
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione, commonly called andro, is an unregulated food
additive. Sales soared in 1998, the year McGwire hit a record 70
home runs for the St. Louis Cardinals, after it was reported that
the first baseman used it. McGwire stopped using it last year.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said andro already meets two of three tests used by
government laboratories to determine whether a substance is a
steroid.
</P>
<P>
   ''I suspect we'll find that it meets the third, although I have
been saying that for over a year now,'' McCaffrey said, admitting
that tests should have been finished already.
</P>
<P>
   If androstenedione does meet the third requirement, it would be
declared a steroid, illegal to use without a legitimate medical
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball did not ban andro despite a study it
financed that found its use could be hazardous. The NBA is
considering a ban now. It already is banned by the International
Olympic Committee, the NCAA, the NFL and the men's and women's
tennis tours.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've regularly met with (baseball officials) on a range of
subjects, including this,'' McCaffrey spokesman Robert Weiner said.
''They're just waiting for the feds. They don't want to take the
initiative on their own. Certainly, other sports have taken an
initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione supplements are made of a naturally occurring
steroid hormone. The body metabolizes andro into testosterone,
which is considered a steroid. When supplements of testosterone are
taken in high doses, they are known to have an anabolic effect --
increasing muscle size and strength.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey's comments came after he gave the keynote address at a
conference on performance-enhancing drug use among athletes,
sponsored by the Citizenship Through Sports Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance comprises major amateur and professional sports
leagues, including the U.S. Olympic Committee and the National
Football League.

<HEADLINE> Religious Israeli Lawmaker Dies  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Avraham Shapira, the ultra-Orthodox lawmaker
known for his masterly political skills, died Monday at the age of
79 after battling diabetes and kidney disease, Israel radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Shapira was elected to Israel's parliament in 1981 and chaired
the powerful finance committee for four years. He was considered
the first ultra-Orthodox politician to successfully penetrate the
secular corridors of Israeli politics.
</P>
<P>
   He was an architect of the 1984-1990 national unity governments
that united Israel's two main opposing parties in a successful
effort to pull the country out of its worst-ever economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi turned politician headed the parliamentary faction of
the Agudat Yisrael party, a precursor to today's United Torah
Judaism party. His personal influence was greater than his party's
representation, which was never more than five legislators out of
120.
</P>
<P>
   Jovial and rotund, he adapted to Israel's backslapping,
meal-intensive political culture quickly and easily. He regarded
the world of politics as a necessary evil in his party's battle to
bring Jews a little closer to holiness. One of his crowning
achievements was the ultimately successful battle to ban importing
pork into the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we can say to God we are purifying the Jewish people,'' he
said in 1985, when he launched the first of a legion of bills to
keep pork out of Israel. The fight was never 100 percent successful
-- raising pigs inside Israel remains legal.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Romania, Shapira immigrated to Israel in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The end of his political career, in the late 1980s, was marred
by allegations that he used his influence as finance committee
chairman to attempt to salvage his family's failing carpet
monolith, Carmel. He tried to stop a journalist from publishing an
unflattering biography, ''The Honcho.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapira died at Tel Hashomer hospital in Tel Aviv and was buried
Monday evening in Jerusalem. There was no immediate word on
survivors.

<HEADLINE> Inmates End Sao Paulo Rebellion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Inmates in southeastern Brazil on
Monday released more than 500 hostages unharmed, ending an 18-hour
rebellion, an official at the Sao Paulo State Prison Administration
said.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages -- 500 relatives of prisoners and three guards -- had
been seized by inmates Sunday during an uprising at the Adriano
Marrey Prison in Guarulhos, an industrial suburb of Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   The uprising began minutes earlier, when a group of heavily
armed men tried to raid the prison to free 20 inmates during
visiting hours, said Rosana Tenreiro, a spokeswoman for the prison
administration. She said the attackers fled after guards opened
fire. One inmate was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ''This apparently enraged the prisoners, who after abandoning
their escape attempt, grabbed three guards hostage and refused to
let 500 visitors -- men, women and children -- leave the prison,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the inmates agreed to release their hostages when
authorities promised to transfer the 20 inmates who had been the
object of the escape attempt to other prison facilities.
Authorities did not immediately say why the armed men targeted
those inmates specifically.

<HEADLINE> Air Traffic Strike Hits France  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French air traffic controllers went on strike
Monday to protest privatization, paralyzing flights in and out of
France and affecting all the country's airlines and airports.
</P>
<P>
   Of 4,500 scheduled flights, only 502 were expected to take off.
The strike was also expected to cut in half the scheduled 3,000
flights over French airspace, according to the General Direction
for Civil Aviation.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-hour strike was to end Tuesday morning. A few controllers
were working despite the strike.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first general work stoppage in nearly a decade by air
traffic controllers. The National Union of Air Traffic Controllers
and all other controllers' unions were protesting what they say are
plans by the EU to privatize the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Many European carriers were forced to cancel flights to France
and reroute planes that would normally fly over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Finnair and Scandinavian Airlines, the multinational airline for
Denmark, Norway and Sweden, canceled all flights to France. Spain's
state airline, Iberia, canceled 26 flights and Swissair and
Crossair, a regional Swiss airline, canceled 120 flights on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Other flights averaged 90-minute delays, with flights to
southern Europe rerouted via Italy, and trans-Atlantic flights
diverted to German airspace.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run train authority said it provided 5,000 extra seats
over the weekend to help compensate for canceled flights between
Paris and major French and other European cities.
</P>
<P>
   European Transport Commissioner Loyola de Palacio is seeking to
replace national management systems of the crowded skies with a
joint management program.
</P>
<P>
   Loyola was to present European transport ministers with a draft
report of her ''single skies'' plan on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   She has estimated that increased flight delays cost some $5
billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   France's Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot said in
statement: ''Each state should remain free to organize its own
system.''

<HEADLINE> Archbishop gives vouches a strong endorsement  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - Newly installed Archbishop Edward Egan strongly
endorsed taxpayer-supported vouchers for private schools on Monday,
saying all parents have the right to decide what kind of moral and
ethical standards their children will be taught.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging news conference, Egan also said the shortage
of young priests was a ''serious problem'' nationally, and candidly
acknowledged hoping that Pope John Paul II would name him a
Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no idea what his plans are,'' Egan said. ''I would take
the appointment. After this appointment, I guess you couldn't ask
for much more. That would be the strawberry on top of the whipped
cream.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan met with reporters a day before leaving for Rome, where on
Thursday he will join other new archbishops in receiving the
pallium, a lambswool garment symbolic of the office.
</P>
<P>
   While what Egan called ''the other issue of choice'' - abortion
- did not come up, choice in education dominated the half-hour
meeting, in which the 6-foot 3-inch cleric stood the whole time,
wielding a hand microphone like a stand-up comic.
</P>
<P>
   Egan said public schools teach moral and ethical standards that
are unacceptable to him and to many Catholics, and said parents who
feel that way should be able to send their children to non-public
schools at taxpayer expense.
</P>
<P>
   ''To suggest for a moment that morality and ethics are not being
taught in the government-controlled schools is ridiculous,'' Egan
said, but adding there were ''many Catholic parents, and many
non-Catholic Christian and Jewish parents,'' who do not share the
values taught in the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parent is the one that has the right to decide how their
child is going to be formed, intellectually, spiritually, humanly.
I would want that available to those parents, who as much as I are
taxpaying citizens, as much as I are committed to a specific view
of life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to explain his specific objections to public school
teachings. ''There's no sense in getting into the contoversy of it
because everybody knows, it's useless to say what's all clear - so
all I am asking for is choice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, who was the bishop in Bridgeport, Conn., before being
called to replace the late Cardinal John O'Connor, said he hoped to
meet soon with New York Public Schools Chancellor Harold Levy to
discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have great respect for Mr. Levy. He wrote me a lovely note,
and I look forward to meeting with him with great pleasure,'' Egan
said, adding, ''and I hope one day we'll be able to announce over
television that all parents have an equal right to decide about the
manner in which their children will be educated.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan also touched on a handful of other issues, including the
church's struggle to recruit new priests, calling it a ''very
serious ... nationwide problem,'' but not unsolvable, he said.
''There are places it is being addressed effectively. I trust we'll
get at it, and solve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan also said sex scandals involving priests have ''done
damage'' but suggested that inordinate attention is given to such
incidents as opposed to those involving other members of clergy,
public schools, court systems or other fields.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything like that does damage. Some cases have no substance
to them, but other cases do have substance, I've never denied
that,'' Egan said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the problem has not damaged recruiting for the
priesthood in Bridgeport, partly because of a ''sense of mutual
support'' and an effective screening system, such as required
psychological testing, to detect problems.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, who is known for his fiscal administrative skills and
closed some schools in Connecticut to save money, said he was
personally committed to saving hard-pressed parochial schools in
minority areas of New York City. ''However,I do believe we have to
stay within our financial possibilities.''

<HEADLINE> Packers Will Stick With Name  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- An animal rights group wants a new name
for the Green Bay Packers. Team president Bob Harlan says no way.
</P>
<P>
   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said Monday in a
letter to Harlan that the name promotes violence and bloodshed
because it refers to meat packers, or those who work in
slaughterhouses.
</P>
<P>
   The letter from PETA vegetarian campaign coordinator Bruce
Friedrich suggests making the team the Green Bay ''Pickers,''
referring to picking fruits, vegetables and other crops, or
possibly the Green Bay ''Six-Packers,'' referring to the state's
brewing history.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been the Packers since 1919, and this is the first time
anyone has suggested that we change our name,'' Harlan said in
reply. ''We like our name, our tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to save the name like we want to save the name of
Lambeau Field.''
</P>
<P>
   The possible sale of naming rights -- or the right of a company
to pay to have its name used on the stadium -- has been among issues
discussed as part of the team's planned $295 million renovation and
expansion of Lambeau Field.
</P>
<P>
   A referendum is scheduled in September for Brown County voters
to decide if they want to raise the county sales tax to help pay
for the stadium project.
</P>
<P>
   Friedrich, contacted Monday, said the Packers should consider
dumping the name despite the long tradition, because of its
reference to the plants where animals are killed.

<HEADLINE> Bush to attend state Conservative Party fund-raising event  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Texas Gov. George W. Bush will attend a
$500-a-person fund-raising luncheon in New York City on July 14 to
benefit the state Conservative Party, its chairman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's coming to my function,'' Michael Long said. The Bush
campaign confirmed that.
</P>
<P>
   Long had originally wanted Bush to be the star attraction at the
party's annual dinner on May 17. Scheduling conflicts were cited at
the time for Bush's decision not to attend the dinner.
</P>
<P>
   But that earlier event came when Long was battling to keep New
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani from getting the party nomination
for his Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton. Bush was a
Giuliani supporter and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Attending the dinner could have left Bush in the position of
raising money that Long could then have used to run a Giuliani
alternative in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the Conservative Party dinner, Giuliani withdrew
from the Senate race because of prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Republican leaders quickly united behind Rep. Rick
Lazio's substitute Senate campaign, as did Long. While Long had
objected to Giuliani's abortion rights positions, he found Lazio's
more to his liking. While Lazio is an abortion rights supporter on
some fronts, he is opposed to what critics call partial-birth
abortions and Medicaid funding to pay for poor women's abortions.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican has won statewide office in New York without
Conservative Party backing since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Attending the Conservative Party event should also put Bush in
line for the party's presidential endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates to
also count votes they receive on third-party ballot lines. That
makes the Conservative Party and other third parties in New York
important political players.
</P>
<P>
   Bush could use such help in New York where Democrats enjoy a 5-3
edge in enrollment. No GOP presidential contender has carried the
state since Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 138; Nasdaq Is Up 67  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Snacks sent the Dow industrials to its highest
level in more than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris, a Dow component and owner of Kraft Foods, led the
average higher Monday as investors applauded the company's plan to
acquire Nabisco Holdings Corp., which makes Ritz crackers,
Snackwell's snacks, Oreo cookies and Life Savers candy.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, one of several mergers the market reacted to Monday,
boosted investors' enthusiasm and helped many take their focus off
the Federal Reserve's meeting this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 138.24 to close at
10,542.99, its largest point gain since June 2.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 13.83 at 1,455.31, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 66.78 at 3,912.12.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris rose $3.50 to $27.125 in the first trading session
since the Sunday announcement of its proposed purchase of Nabisco
for $14.9 billion plus the assumption of $4 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Once the deal is completed, Philip Morris plans to begin work on
an initial public offering of up to 15 percent of the stock in the
newly combined food company.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, which comes amid a flurry of consolidation in the
food industry, also boosted the broader market, said Alan Ackerman,
senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ''It energizes the market,'' he said. ''And it gets massive
amounts of cash flowing through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading was fairly light as investors looked ahead to the Fed's
impending decision on interest rates, to be announced on Wednesday.
Most economists believe the Fed will leave rates unchanged, sensing
that six rate increases in the past year are successfully slowing
the economy to a more sustainable pace.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have less than one week left before the end of the quarter,
and it appears that some people are willing to put funds to work
now based on the fact that the Fed may leave rates unchanged,''
Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which benefit from stable interest rates, led
the blue-chip Dow higher Monday. J.P. Morgan rose $1.188 to
$118.438 and Citigroup rose $2.438 to $64.125.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson added to the Dow's strength, rising $5.75 to
$95.50. PaineWebber analyst David Lothson raised his rating on the
stock to ''buy'' from ''neutral,'' saying the company's solid
earnings growth makes it a good investment should interest rates
continue rising.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts remain unsure that the Fed will leave rates
untouched this week. John H. Shaughnessy, chief investment
strategist at Advest Inc., said the Fed may opt for one more
quarter-percentage point increase before ending its long cycle of
rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their motivation to raise rates now in the face of obvious
economic slowing may be to keep the stock market from rising
sharply,'' he said. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has been critical
of the ''wealth effect,'' in which the escalating stock market has
fueled rampant consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks mounted a modest recovery from last week's
selloff, but investors were focusing on the strongest,
best-capitalized companies. Oracle rose $3.188 to $82.688 and Sun
Microsystems rose $3.875 to $90.438.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, a merger in the online retailing sector did nothing
to stimulate investors' enthusiasm. Webvan Group, which is buying
HomeGrocer.com, tumbled $1.375 to $7.344, while HomeGrocer dropped
$1.063 to $7.031, both on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 1.08
billion shares, down from 1.21 billion Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.95 to 516.36.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.2 percent.
Germany's DAX index rose 0.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 gained
0.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 0.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bowls Cut From New Orleans' Budget  </HEADLINE>
By MARY FOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Legislative efforts to trim the state budget
chopped $1 million from the Sugar Bowl and $250,000 from
Shreveport's Independence Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the cuts won't hurt much this year. If it's not
reinstated in upcoming budgets, however, the pinch will become more
painful.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're disappointed, but we recognize the problem the state is
facing,'' said Sugar Bowl executive director Paul Hoolahan.
''Fortunately we knew there was no guarantee that the money would
be there, so we established our budget on the possibility that
would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The money was to be used to pay competing teams in the Sugar
Bowl. It would have been used to meet a variety of operating costs
as well as payout to the teams in the Independence Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously we would have loved to have had it,'' said
Independence Bowl assistant executive director Tom Starr. ''But
we'll take a two-pronged road to making up for the loss. We'll
tighten where we can, and we'll look again to private sources to
try to raise additional revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Each team that plays in the Sugar Bowl receives about $13
million. Much of the money comes from television.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a lot of money to lose,'' Hoolahan said. ''If it had
happened three of four years ago when we were fairly desperate, we
would have really been in bad shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The new contract with the Bowl Championship Series that gives
the Sugar Bowl the NCAA championship game every four years has
helped the Sugar Bowl rebound financially. The BCS, which includes
the Sugar Bowl, the Rose Bowl, the Orange Bowl and the Fiesta Bowl,
rotates the national title game among the four.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have planned financially to at least be able to go through
the next two years, which is the end of our first BCS contractual
agreement,'' Hoolahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Both bowls are hopeful the money will be restored next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first blush people might question why the state should
support the bowls,'' Starr said. ''But it pays off. Both bowls have
substantial economic impact and bring the state national
publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Independence Bowl had a $31 million impact in the Shreveport
area last year, Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   A study done for the Sugar Bowl showed that it had a $240
million impact on the New Orleans area last year. But even without
the national title game, the bowl has an average impact of between
$175 million and $200 million, Hoolahan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully our lawmakers are fully aware of the importance of
the bowls to the state economy,'' Hoolahan said.

<HEADLINE> Construction of Korean War memorial delayed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - A rainy spring and construction
problems have delayed the planned July unveiling of a memorial to
the nearly 800 New Jerseyans killed in the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   The target date had been July 27, the 47th anniversary of the
end of the war.
</P>
<P>
   When the memorial was conceived several years ago, it was
originally hoped that it could be dedicated on June 25, the 50th
anniversary of the start of the war. But that target date couldn't
be met.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the most recent delays, organizers don't have a date
scheduled, although they hope the memorial can be unveiled in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The rainy spring and construction troubles, including the
discovery of more underground pipes than anticipated, have delayed
the project in Brighton Park along the Boardwalk at Park Place.
</P>
<P>
   ''The weather's been bad, you've got to admit,'' Larry St.
Laurent, chairman of the state's Korean War Veterans Memorial
Committee, told The Star-Ledger of Newark for Monday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   He and Col. Stephen Abel, the state's administrator for
veteran's cemeteries, memorials and museums, said they regretted
missing the target dates, but want the project done right.
</P>
<P>
   ''For us, sooner is better, but not at the risk of quality,''
Abel said. ''We don't want to have to be making repairs in a year
because we rushed into it.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorial will feature a 12-foot statue of a mourning soldier
clutching dog tags. To his left, two soldiers and a nurse will be
seen emerging through a sheet of water that cascades into a
reflecting pool.
</P>
<P>
   Also planned is an eternal flame above a wall featuring the
names of the New Jersey people who died or were missing in action
during the conflict, which lasted from 1950 to 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Some veterans from northern New Jersey lobbied to have the
memorial built somewhere closer to them. But supporters said the
location, just off the world-famous Boardwalk, was better because
it guarantees pedestrian traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The city donated the land, and the casinos, through the state
Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, gave $1 million for the
project.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly on Monday voted, 79-0, to contribute $500,000
toward the memorial. A Senate committee is considering the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Private donors also have contributed.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Opposition Celebrates  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Honking horns and shouting ''change!''
supporters of Zimbabwe's main opposition party took to the streets
Monday night to celebrate significant victories in the most hotly
contested elections in this southern African nation's 20-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   In early results, the Movement for Democratic Change won 18 of
the first 33 districts announced in Zimbabwe's 150-seat parliament.
The ruling ZANU-PF party won the other 15 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition party, which held only three seats previously,
has posed the strongest challenge to President Robert Mugabe's
party since 1980, when Mugabe's party led the country to
independence from white-minority rule.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary election came after months of campaign-related
violence and unrest over the takeovers of hundreds of white-owned
farms by armed black squatters. Opposition members said the
takeovers were sanctioned by Mugabe's government. Some accused the
government of encouraging the takeovers to build its support among
landless blacks before the election.
</P>
<P>
   With Zimbabwe's economy in shambles, a huge number of voters
turned out for the two-day weekend election -- estimated in excess
of 3 million of the nation's 5.1 million registered voters. That
overwhelmed counting stations, leading to repeated delays Monday in
confirming results.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout ''was just too large ... more than twice as much as
ever before,'' said Tobaiwa Mudede, the state Registrar General.
</P>
<P>
   As both sides waited for more results to come in, international
observers from the European Union said the campaign was badly
tainted by violence and could not be considered free and fair. At
least 30 people were killed ahead of the vote, and thousands were
beaten and threatened, mainly by ruling party militants.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in Mugabe's party ''seemed to sanction the use of
violence and intimidation against political opponents and
contributed significantly to the climate of fear so evident during
the election campaign,'' the EU said.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition supporters also waged attacks, but they were far
fewer and their leaders were clear in their condemnation of the
violence, observers said.
</P>
<P>
   After the first results were announced on national television,
some Movement for Democratic Change supporters drove through the
streets of Harare giving the party's open hand salute. Among the
ruling party's losses were the seats held by the ministers of
transport and national affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Police were being deployed throughout the country to prevent
outbreaks of trouble -- especially in the southwestern Harare suburb
of Budiriro, the scene of repeated clashes in previous weeks
between ruling party militants and opposition supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who win must be graceful and not target losers. Those
who lose must accept losing with honor,'' Police Commissioner
Augustine Chihuri said in a nationwide broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Masipula Sithole, head of the independent
Public Opinion Institute of Harare, said leaks from voting
officials indicated that the opposition captured a large majority
in the first constituencies counted.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this margin is maintained, it will be a humiliating defeat
for Mugabe,'' Sithole said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Mugabe is not on the ballot -- his presidential term
doesn't expire until 2002 -- a strong opposition showing would be a
major blow to the autocratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 120 of parliament's 150 seats were on the ballot.
Mugabe and his allies appoint the remaining 30 seats, giving them a
substantial advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition would need 76 seats to gain a simple majority and
stop legislation proposed by Mugabe. In the last parliament,
Mugabe's party commanded all but three seats.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Mugabe loyalists faced tough races in rural areas,
Mugabe's traditional stronghold, where he allowed ruling party
militants to illegally occupy 1,400 white-owned farms.

<HEADLINE> Two Plainfield officials admit wrongdoing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Two Plainfield officials pleaded guilty to
federal charges Monday, one admitting he extorted more than $10,000
from a contractor and the other admitting he cheated on his
corporate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately disclosed whether there is a connection
between the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have agreed to cooperate with investigators as part of
their plea bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Talley, 52, a commissioner of the Plainfield Housing
Authority, pleaded guilty to one extortion count.
</P>
<P>
   Talley said he extorted more than $10,000 in 1995 and 1996 from
a contractor interested in doing work on the construction of the $6
million Plainfield Health Center in Union County.
</P>
<P>
   Talley admitted that although he had no vote on awarding those
contracts, he told the contractor that he controlled those who did.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Talley was parks and recreation director in
Irvington, Essex County, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   A former housing authority commissioner, Bruce J. Watson,
admitted he evaded more than $23,500 in taxes in 1995 and 1996 in
pleading guilty to a single count.
</P>
<P>
   Watson owned a consulting company, the Baldwin Group Inc. During
that period, Watson said he wrote corporate checks to cash and
opened a business bank account with a false Social Security number
to conceal income.
</P>
<P>
   Talley faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine when
sentenced Sept. 25 by U.S. District Judge John C. Lifland. Watson,
48, faces up to five years in prison and a $100,000 fine. The
actual penalties would be far less, under federal guidelines, which
do not permit parole.
</P>
<P>
   Watson must also pay back taxes and penalties.

<HEADLINE> Heart Group OKs Stem-Cell Research  </HEADLINE>
By KELLIE B. GORMLY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The American Heart Association has agreed to
support stem-cell research, putting it on a collision course with
abortion opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the heart association said stem cells, the building
blocks of human tissue, hold out hope for helping people suffering
from heart disease, strokes and other ailments.
</P>
<P>
   But the stem cells' sources -- often aborted fetuses or discarded
human embryos -- have triggered opposition from some medical
ethicists and anti-abortion groups.
</P>
<P>
   The heart association's 43 board members agreed Sunday to
support the use of donors' money and federal funds to support
stem-cell research.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately, the board felt that this research has the
opportunity to save millions of lives,'' said Dr. Rose Marie
Robertson, the association's president-elect and a professor of
medicine at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The move had been recommended by an eight-member task force that
the board appointed to study the issue. The task force included
scientists and a bioethicist, and it conducted extensive interviews
with councils and organizations from all sides of the issue, heart
association officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision approves stem-cell research as a candidate for
future funding but does not necessarily dispense money to any
particular research project, an association spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The association also will not fund any stem-cell research until
strict guidelines to prevent abuses are in place, Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Although specific guidelines are being explored and should be
adopted within six months, they would include prohibiting the
creation of embryos to harvest stem cells or to create a human
being. The guidelines also would prohibit payment to people such as
donors or doctors for stem cell research.
</P>
<P>
   Such guidelines are not reassuring to anti-abortion opponents,
said Kyleen Wright, president of the Texans for Life Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ''You still have the same problem,'' Wright said. ''On the one
hand, you want to reduce abortions in this country ... but on the
other hand, you're creating a whole new market that depends on
abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Heart Association called stem-cell research the
''most promising medical and scientific research'' to help fight
cardiovascular disease and stroke, the No. 1 and No. 3 killers in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Association officials estimate that 128 million Americans -- 58
million of them with cardiovascular disease -- have ailments
including cancer, Parkinson's disease and osteoporosis that could
be treated or cured with discoveries from stem-cell research.
</P>
<P>
   The cells could eventually be cultivated to become cardiac
tissue, then transplanted into failing or weakened hearts, medical
experts said.

<HEADLINE> Freed Fiji Hostages Speak Out  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Hostages released from 37 days in captivity in
Fiji said Monday they were treated relatively well but that life
inside the parliamentary building where they were held was an
emotional seesaw of fear and hope.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rules of the house are that when the lights are out it's
quiet time, but when you hear a gunshot you hit the deck and stay
there until the all-clear signs are given,'' said Marieta Rigamoto,
the deposed assistant agriculture minister.
</P>
<P>
   Rigamoto was released Sunday along with the three other female
hostages held at gunpoint inside Fiji's parliament. At a church
Monday in the capital of Suva, Rigamoto and another freed hostage,
Lavenia Wainiqolo Padarath, the former minister of women, culture
and social welfare, offered tearful testimony of their ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   When gunmen led by former insurance executive George Speight
stormed parliament on May 19 and took the government hostage in the
name of indigenous Fijian rights, Rigamoto said she ''wasn't sure
what was happening until one of them fired a gun and I said to
myself 'this is real.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''My first reaction was to say a short prayer and ask God to
keep me calm,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That Friday, she said Speight's men handcuffed the male
hostages, mostly members of the government of deposed Prime
Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, and proceeded to do the same to the
women until Speight intervened and told them not to.
</P>
<P>
   ''So I said, well, that's a positive sign. At least they have
the heart to spare us,'' Rigamoto said.
</P>
<P>
   The women were not the first from the group to be freed. At
least five people were released for various reasons, including
three men who were let go days after parliament was stormed.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations to free the remaining 27 hostages were deadlocked
on Monday, just three days after all the parties said a deal had
been reached. Army spokesman Lt. Col. Filipo Tarakinikini said the
rebels had come up with an 11th hour demand -- that they be allowed
to name a new president -- that torpedoed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Padarath, an indigenous Fijian who is married to an ethnic
Indian, hosted a quiet get-together of relatives and friends Monday
night, but said she found it hard to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't stop our relatives, but at the same time we are still
very mindful of our brothers who are still in captivity,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the celebration, indigenous Fijians and ethnic Indians mixed
happily.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fijian TV showed footage of an Indo-Fijian hostage
drinking kava -- a mildly intoxicating drink made from a plant root
-- with some of his captors. ''We're treated well,'' former lawmaker
Vinod Mahara said, speaking in Fijian. ''Our races have been
separate too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten days after the May 19 raid on parliament, the army assumed
control of the South Pacific nation in what they said was an
attempt to keep Fiji from descending into anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Speight's demands to disenfranchise Fiji's Indian
minority have already been met, including the firing of Chaudhry,
who was the country's first Indian prime minister, and the
elimination of the country's 1997 multiracial constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff, now entering its sixth week, has pitted Fiji's
poor Fijian majority against its relatively affluent Indian
minority, whose ancestors were brought to Fiji by English
colonialists over a century ago to work in the country's rich sugar
cane fields.
</P>
<P>
   Half the hostages are indigenous and half are Indian. The freed
hostages, all of whom are indigenous, said the two groups have been
separated in captivity and prohibited from speaking to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Rigamoto made a plea Monday for greater tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because they are Christians,'' she said of her fellow Fijians,
''they must have room for minority groups ... and other races.''
</P>
<P>
   The freed women said they spent their days in captivity reading,
playing cards and praying.
</P>
<P>
   They were not given access to newspapers, but Rigamoto said they
could tell how well the negotiations were going by how late in the
evening Speight and other rebel leaders visited them.
</P>
<P>
   ''If by six o'clock they didn't come back to us, we knew the
talks had failed,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Accused GI Declines To Enter Plea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- A U.S. soldier accusing of raping and
killing an 11-year-old Kosovo girl and leaving her body in the snow
declined to enter a plea at his arraignment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Frank J. Ronghi faces charges of premeditated murder,
felony murder, rape, forcible sodomy and indecent acts with a child
in the Jan. 13 killing. He was arrested shortly after the girl's
body was found in the southern Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   During the arraignment Monday, authorities scheduled Ronghi's
court-martial to begin July 31, said Jim Boyle, spokesman for U.S.
Army Europe headquarters in Heidelberg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Another hearing will be held before then, and Ronghi will have a
chance to enter a plea. No date for the next hearing was
immediately set, Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Ronghi could have faced a death sentence if convicted of the
murder charges. But the Army had declined to seek the death penalty
out of deference to Germany's strong opposition to capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's death raised tensions between peacekeeping troops in
Kosovo and ethnic Albanians. Ethnic Albanians in the province had
already been critical of other alleged mistreatment, including
inappropriate body searches of women since the 50,000-person
NATO-led force entered Kosovo last June.
</P>
<P>
   Ronghi is a weapons squad leader assigned to the 3rd Battalion,
504th Parachute Infantry Regiment of Fort Bragg, N.C. He was sent
to work with U.S. forces from Germany serving in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He is being tried at the 1st Infantry Division courtroom at
Leighton Barracks in Wuerzburg, about 60 miles east of Frankfurt.

<HEADLINE> Two barefoot divas, Cesaria Evora and Cassandra Wilson, perform at Carnegie Hall </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Time seemed to slow and the longing seemed
palpable on Friday as two barefoot divas with richly emotional
voices, Cesaria Evora and Cassandra Wilson, shared the stage at
Carnegie Hall as part of the JVC Jazz Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The two have starkly different styles, but were united in their
deeply earthy voices and an African influence that echoed
throughout in music that seemed intertwined with movement.
</P>
<P>
   Evora is from the Cape Verde islands off the coast of Senegal
and sings ''morna,'' a local song style she has made
internationally famous. Like Portuguese fado music, it combines
yearning and nostalgia and regret. Many in the audience barely
could remain in their seats as the rhythms soared, and some got
teary eyed as she sung the heart-wrenching songs that are her
trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, a longtime New Yorker, sings in a distinctive jazz style
that hovers in a neighborhood somewhere between scat and blues. Her
entire body moves along with her voice as she squeezes every drop
of meaning from her sultry and often-poetic lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Both, at their best, are magical, and the evening was
unforgettable. It was made even more so by an unexpected third
barefoot star - Cindi Lauper - joining in toward the end.
</P>
<P>
   Evora started the evening with ''Sodad,'' a slow and emotional
classic of hers, followed by another equally languorous and tearful
song of longing. The pace then quickened and she and her 10-member
band rolled right into a faster song that had dozens of audience
members on their feet and sensuously moving their hips.
</P>
<P>
   Her dozen songs switched back and forth between fast and slow
and the bossa nova song she finished with brought down the house.
The standing ovation brought her back for one more - a jazzier song
with a wailing saxophone intertwined with the lyrics ''Kiss Me a
Lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassandra Wilson devoted most of her set to songs from her
recent album ''Traveling Miles.'' They featured lyrics she wrote
and music associated with Miles Davis, and Wilson's unusual pacing
made the time seem to stretch. At some points she seemed to stretch
from there to sheer blues and at others into more
traditional-sounding jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Lauper walked on unannounced - and also barefoot - late in the
set, and the two did ''Time After Time'' (with Lauper on dulcimer)
and an eerie combination of Wilson's ''Sea and Sky'' and Irving
Berlin's ''Blue Skies.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson stood her own and her voice seemed by far the
stronger and more sultry of the two.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the evening, the entire audience seemed to be
stomping and whistling and calling out for more. But the barefoot
divas had already departed.

<HEADLINE> Six Slain in Mexico City Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Authorities discovered six bodies burning in
an eastern Mexico City home after receiving an anonymous phone call
reporting a homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Among the victims found Sunday morning were five family members,
including a 90-year-old man and an 8-year-old boy, said Salvador
Rodriguez, a spokesman for the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   One woman was still unidentified, Rodriguez said. The Reforma
newspaper said she was the family's nurse.
</P>
<P>
   When officials arrived at the house Sunday, they saw smoke
coming from some of the windows. After firefighters extinguished
the blaze, they found the six bodies, four of which had been
completely burned, Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the victims had been beaten or asphyxiated, Reforma
said, and the assailants set the house on fire. Authorities were
investigating the possibility of a vengeance killing, it said.

<HEADLINE> Concern Mounts Over Mexico Media  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI CARL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Negative media coverage of the top opposition
presidential candidate increased significantly in the last month,
election officials said Monday, adding to concern that news
organizations are failing to provide balanced coverage in advance
of Sunday's elections.
</P>
<P>
   In April, when polls began showing Vicente Fox with enough
support to possibly end 71 years of single-party rule in Mexico,
the news media drifted away from relatively balanced coverage --
remarkable for Mexico -- and began concentrating on the ruling-party
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference Monday at the independent Federal
Electoral Institute, which is running the elections, officials said
Fox and his Alliance for Change coalition have been receiving the
brunt of all negative coverage -- jumping to 70 percent in mid-June
from less than 30 percent in early May.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or
PRI, received about 25 percent of negative media coverage in the
days before Sunday's vote, dropping from 60 percent in early May.
Most recent polls have shown the PRI's candidate, Francisco
Labastida, in a statistical tie with Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's media have historically supported the government, which
controls lucrative state advertising, a key source of income for
many news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere Monday, Fox met with leftist supporters and pleaded
with anyone who wants a change of government to see him as their
only chance.
</P>
<P>
   At an event in a Mexico City hotel, Fox sat on stage with some
of Mexico's most fervent leftists. Many have resigned as activists
of their own parties to throw their support behind Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have an idea in common -- a desire, an urgency -- for a
change in our country,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged that if elected, his government would be ''plural and
inclusive. A government that is made up of members of all the
different political forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Fox supporters in the leftist Democratic Revolution Party
criticized their party's presidential candidate, Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, who has attacked Fox viciously in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas is running a distant third in the race and has rejected
Fox's repeated requests to join his Alliance for Change, made up of
the candidate's own center-right National Action Party and the
small Green party.
</P>
<P>
   ''We regret his lack of will to finish off the PRI,'' Baltazar
Avila, one of the founders of Democratic Revolution, said of
Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   Before the event, a businessman defended himself against
accusations that he had funneled illegal foreign donations to the
Fox campaign. Miguel Hakim, a businessman from Puebla state, handed
out paperwork showing that the funds in question were part of a
legitimate business transaction and never wound up in the Fox
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would file a lawsuit against the ruling-party
officials who showed copies of checks his company allegedly had
written. The party officials violated Mexico's banking-secrecy
laws, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A 9-year-old girl who appeared in anti-Fox television
advertisements also showed up, crying as she criticized the ruling
party for using her image.
</P>
<P>
   In the advertisement, the girl is shown on stage at a Fox rally
reciting a verse about ruling-party corruption, which includes a
mild obscenity. A voice-over asks parents whether this is the kind
of man they want as president for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a lie because they didn't show the whole thing,'' said
Daniela Vargas Sanchez. ''I wish they weren't such liars and so
corrupt anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   She explained that she did use the obscenity, but in a reference
to former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, possibly the most
hated man in Mexico. In the eyes of many Mexicans, that would make
it more than understandable.

<HEADLINE> Senate approves school pledge measure  </HEADLINE>
By HANAH CHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey schoolchildren could soon be
reciting part of the Declaration of Independence every morning
under a bill passed by the state Senate Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill now heads to the state Assembly, but sponsors there
said it's uncertain whether action will be taken on the measure
before summer recess Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe it is the single most important piece of legislation
I've been involved in ... because it gives us an opportunity to
transmit the values of America to our young people,'' said Sen.
Gerald Cardinale, R-Bergen, the bill sponsor. ''These values,
however one might wish to minimize them, have given birth to the
kinds of standards of living we enjoy and to the freedom that
Americans enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill barely passed by a vote of 21-16 with three
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, children in grades three through 12 would recite
a portion of the Declaration of Independence after the pledge of
allegiance each morning.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which has been kicking around the Statehouse
for 13 years, would require students to recite the following
portion of the historic document:
</P>
<P>
   ''We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are
created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are
instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent
of the governed.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also require school districts to teach students
about the document, explaining the historical context, such as why
it refers only to men, that it was written while slavery was
accepted in the United States and the subsequent relevance to the
civil rights and the women's movements.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman said she is comfortable with the bill
because it goes beyond mere recitation and incorporates the
declaration into the curriculum, said spokeswoman Jayne O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   The state's education standards already require young students
to learn about the declaration and its historical significance.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Wayne Bryant, D-Camden, a black legislator who opposed the
measure, said the language of the declaration did not apply to
black people or women.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't need to recite what has no legitimacy in time or
space,'' Bryant said. ''This gives no meaning and no educational
value to our young people.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure was originally posted for a vote in March, but was
tabled after Cardinale lost votes because of opposition from black
senators. They objected to the clause that says, ''All men are
created equal'' because when the declaration was written, that
basic democratic principle did not apply to black people.
</P>
<P>
   Co-sponsor Assemblyman Guy Talarico, R-Bergen, said he expects
the Assembly to act as quickly as possible on the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is support for this bill in this house,'' Talarico said.
</P>
<P>
   The lower house passed a similar measure last June.

<HEADLINE> State sheriffs file a lawsuit against the state  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Connecticut's eight high sheriffs and
eight chief deputy sheriffs on Monday sued the state, claiming that
a new law has violated their constitutional right to freedom of
expression and interfered with their authority.
</P>
<P>
   The law - which was passed in May by the General Assembly - puts
the fate of the sheriff system in the hands of voters during a
November referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriffs are fighting two provisions of the law. One bans
them from associating and communicating with deputy sheriffs and
their families to prevent the sheriffs from soliciting
contributions to fight the referendum. The other has transferred
the power to appoint deputies from the sheriffs to a board of
political appointees in the judicial department.
</P>
<P>
   ''This lawsuit does not directly attack the referendum
initiative,'' said George C. Springer Jr., the New Britain lawyer
representing the sheriffs. ''The law clearly and plainly suppresses
freedom of expression.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheriffs did not speak at a news conference at the state
Capitol Monday, Springer said, because ''if they do so, they run
the risk of being arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed Monday in U.S. District Court in New
Haven. A hearing was scheduled for Tuesday in federal court in
Bridgeport. The sheriffs are seeking a temporary injunction against
the law.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers pushing for the reform insist the provisions were
necessary. Critics say the sheriffs have a history of strong-arming
the special deputies they hire and the deputies they appoint for
political contributions - allegations the sheriffs have denied.
</P>
<P>
   State Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin Sullivan, D-West
Hartford, said Monday that the provision was added to prevent
people who work in the sheriffs' department from having to give
money to their bosses.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is possible for the sheriffs, or the friends of the
sheriffs to raise money to fight the referendum,'' Sullivan said.
''All this says is that you can't lean on people who work for you.
I think the courts will find that is not an infringement of
(sheriffs') rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit names Gov. John G. Rowland, Chief Administrative
Judge Robert Leuba and Chief State's Attorney John Bailey as the
plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not unexpected,'' Rowland spokesman Dean Pagani said.
''They'll have their day in court.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the state Judicial Department said that Leuba
had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment. Bailey could not be
reached for comment Monday. Messages were left at his office by The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is just the latest incident to shake the sheriff
system in the past year. A female prisoner has alleged she was
raped while being transported in a New Haven County sheriffs van.
In addition, two county sheriffs, including Windham County Sheriff
Tom White, have pleaded innocent to criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff system is also under investigation by state and
federal agencies.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Wild Pleased With Draft  </HEADLINE>
By JASON WOLF
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota Wild officials might need a minute
to catch their breath.
</P>
<P>
   After a week in which the Wild hired a coach, stocked their
roster through the expansion draft, began building for the future
with the entry draft and made a few trades, team officials were
tired but exuberant Monday as they looked back on the biggest week
-- so far -- in their short history.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is probably one of those milestone events,'' said owner
Robert Naegele Jr., who led a group that paid $80 million for the
franchise rights. ''Now we have names and faces and stats and
records.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wild's roster swelled to 49 players by Sunday, after the
team took 26 players in the expansion draft, nine in the entry
draft and traded for two forwards. The others were picked up
earlier, through free agency and trades.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota even had its first competition: a head-to-head matchup
with the Columbus Blue Jackets in the expansion draft. Naegele said
he was impressed with general manager Doug Risebrough's drafting.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a soft game in the sense that it was like a preseason
scrimmage,'' Naegele said. ''Nobody keeps an official score but
everybody was keeping score. There were probably a couple of
disappointments, but more than couple of high-fives.''
</P>
<P>
   Risebrough and his staff may have been high-fiving each other
over the weekend, but there may not be many of those on the ice
this season. The Wild didn't get a lot of offensive punch.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not to say the roster is full of duds. Tough guy Jeff
Odgers, taken from Colorado, is a likely fan favorite who will
never hesitate to drop his gloves and Scott Pellerin plays with a
fire that hockey-crazy Minnesotans are sure to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Young goalies Jamie McLennan, a backup in St. Louis last year,
and Manny Fernandez, acquired earlier from Dallas, could develop
into a solid tandem.
</P>
<P>
   The Wild's first-round draft pick, Slovakian forward Marian
Gaborik, is a strong, quick skater who is known as a natural
scorer. Scouts say Gaborik, 18, is an effective playmaker who has
strong puckhandling skills and does well in one-on-one situations.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the older European prospects could become scoring
threats as soon as this season. Fifth-round selection Maxim
Sushinsky, who turns 26 this week, was the second-leading scorer in
the Russian Elite League last season with 43 points in 37 games.
And seventh-rounder Peter Bartos, 26, had 48 points in 41 games in
the Czech Republic Elite League last year.
</P>
<P>
   The man who will guide the Wild on the ice is Jacques Lemaire, a
Hall of Fame player who won eight Stanley Cups in 12 seasons with
Montreal, won two championships as assistant general manager with
the Canadiens and coached the New Jersey Devils to the 1995 Stanley
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Lemaire, 54, was hired by Risebrough on June 13. Naegele said
his general manager's choice of a former teammate -- Lemaire and
Risebrough played in Montreal from 1974-1979 when the Canadiens won
four straight Stanley Cups -- was just the first in a series of
moves last week that proved that Risebrough's work over the last 10
months is paying off.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say that he had a huge week,'' Naegele said. ''The
three days for the draft, it's like somebody starting in September
the school year and then you have your exams. So this is the
examination. The performance on the exam is a direct result of how
well you did your homework during the year. Obviously it's quite
remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   With 99 days until the 2000-01 season starts, the Wild don't
plan on relaxing, even though much of the hockey side of building a
team is complete and there are already more than 12,000 season
tickets sold.
</P>
<P>
   The Wild still need to hire assistant coaches -- Montreal's Mario
Tremblay and Buffalo's Mike Ramsey are reported to be candidates --
find a practice facility, bring in support staff such as trainers
and equipment managers and, oh yeah, finish building the $130
million Xcel Energy Center in downtown St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can see a number of critical dates that we have to meet,''
Naegele said. ''We're doing two things. We're building a team and
we're completing an arena. We have a duel track which required
maximum attention; we hesitate to peak too soon.''

<HEADLINE> NBC, Fox Reject BB's Payment Demand  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC and Fox have rejected baseball's demands
they triple their payments for broadcast rights starting next year,
preferring to let the bidding go on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball had asked Fox to increase its yearly payments from $115
million to $345 million per season and for NBC to raise its outlay
from $80 million to $240 million, only to meet refusals from both
networks, television industry sources said Monday, speaking on the
condition they not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions will allow baseball to sell its rights on the open
market for the All-Star game, playoffs, World Series and Saturday
game of the week. Both NBC and Fox had exclusive negotiating
periods before baseball could open talks with ABC, which is owned
by The Walt Disney Co., and CBS.
</P>
<P>
   NBC will televise the All-Star game next month, and Fox will
broadcast the World Series, with the networks splitting the league
championships. The contracts expire after this season,
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's $800 million, six-year contract, which began this season,
is not affected by the network deals.
</P>
<P>
   When baseball negotiated a series in November 1995 that totaled
$1.7 billion for five years, the sport was just starting to recover
from a 232-day strike that wiped out the 1994 World Series, the
first cancellation of baseball's championship in 90 years.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig and top aide, chief operating officer
Paul Beeston, have sought a large increases, reflecting a change in
the marketplace caused by deals signed by other sports in the past
three years as the economy boomed.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Selig nor Beeston returned telephone calls Monday
seeking comment, and no one at Fox or NBC would comment for
attribution.
</P>
<P>
   The current escalation began in 1997, when the NBA agreed to
$2.64 billion, four-year deals with NBC ($1.75 billion) and Turner
Broadcasting ($890 million).
</P>
<P>
   The NFL, CBS, Fox and Disney agreed the following year to
contracts totaling $17.6 billion over eight years, with FOX paying
$4.4 billion for the NFC Sunday package, CBS paying $4 billion for
the AFC Sunday series, and Disney paying $9.2 billion for ABC's
''Monday Night Football'' and ESPN's Sunday night games.
</P>
<P>
   Disney then signed a $600 million, five-year contract with the
NHL for ABC and ESPN to televise NHL games beginning with the
1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, CBS agreed to keep the NCAA basketball
tournament for an $11 billion, six-year contract that starts in
2003.
</P>
<P>
   CBS broadcast baseball from 1990-93, losing hundreds of millions
of dollars in a $1.057 billion deal, partly because of a steep
decline in ratings and partly because of a national recession.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball formed a joint venture with NBA and ABC called The
Baseball Network for the 1994 and '95 seasons, a deal that was
terminated after two years.

<HEADLINE> Chirac KOs European Gov't Concept  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Rejecting an idea suggested by Germany's foreign
minister, French President Jacques Chirac said Monday that a
Europe-wide government would be the wrong way to unite the
continent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it would be accepted by the individual
countries,'' Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
   But the French president reassured observers who worry that
relations between Germany and France have been strained of late. He
insisted the German-French ''motor'' that has traditionally driven
European integration is running smoothly as the 15-nation European
Union debates plans to accept new members, mostly former communist
countries of Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac's remarks came during an official visit to Berlin. The
trip was designed to coordinate strategy with Germany on EU
enlargement and smooth over discord between the two key partners
before France takes over the rotating EU presidency this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions surfaced last month after a speech by German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer outlining his ''personal vision'' of a
united Europe, including a European federation with some form of
central government.
</P>
<P>
   The speech at Berlin's Humboldt University set off violent
debate in France. French Interior Minister Jean-Paul Chevenement
was forced to apologize for saying Germany wants to impose its
views on Europe and has not been ''cured'' of its Nazi past.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint interview on German television Sunday, Chirac and
German Chancellor Schroeder insisted that the two countries are in
harmony in the drive for a larger united Europe. Both agreed that
the EU must make more decisions by majority and that a European
constitution is a good idea.

<HEADLINE> Piazza Leads NL All-Star Voting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In a week with no changes among the leaders, New
York Mets catcher Mike Piazza topped the voting for NL starters in
next month's All-Star game, with Mark McGwire second and Ken
Griffey Jr. third.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, a seven-time All-Star who has started the past six
All-Star games, had 1,239,531 votes in totals announced Monday.
Pittsburgh's Jason Kendall was second among catchers with 338,048.
</P>
<P>
   Voting at ballparks ends Tuesday, while voting on the Internet
continues through Saturday. Starters will be announced July 4 and
reserves the next day.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, whose 28 homers for St. Louis led the major leagues
going into Monday night's games, led at first base with 1,019,332
votes, followed by Atlanta's Andres Galarraga (488,776).
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, a 10-time All-Star for Seattle before February's trade
to Cincinnati, topped NL outfielders with 1,000,924, followed by
San Francisco's Barry Bonds (873,847) and Sammy Sosa (801,404), who
could be dealt by the Chicago Cubs before the July 11 game at
Atlanta's Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's Vladimir Guerrero (724,352) was fourth among
outfielders, followed by St. Louis' Jim Edmonds (668,147). San
Diego's Tony Gwynn (292,695), who is injured, moved past Arizona's
Steve Finley (269,983) into sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Craig Biggio (452,863) maintained his lead at second
base, followed by New York's Edgardo Alfonzo (387,893).
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's Barry Larkin (708,047) kept his comfortable lead at
shortstop, with Rey Ordonez of the New York Mets, who is out for
the season with a broken arm, second at 434,596.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Chipper Jones led third basemen with 703,864, more
than double the No. 2 vote-getter, Robin Ventura of the Mets
(330,212).
</P>
<P>
   Updated AL vote totals are to be released Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Thatcher's Handbag Goes Up for Sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- It has been spotted in capitals around the world,
carried British government secrets and decorated the arm of one of
Britain's most formidable leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Now one of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's handbags is
going on the auction block to aid charity.
</P>
<P>
   Lady Thatcher has donated her trademark handbag -- a
medium-sized, black Ferragamo -- to be auctioned, with proceeds
going to the Breast Cancer Care charity, she said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This handbag was used for many special occasions,'' said
Thatcher, one of the world's most instantly recognizable
politicians during her tenure as Conservative Party prime minister
from 1979-90. ''I would only let it go for a good cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher's handbag, always carried Queen Elizabeth II-style on
the forearm, became a familiar sight as she met with other world
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   From it, she produced one-sheet policy documents in the middle
of talks on subjects ranging from nuclear missiles to European
Union farm subsidies. Armed with it, she also ended -- or blighted --
the careers of fellow government ministers.
</P>
<P>
   It all prompted the Oxford English Dictionary to record an
entry: ''To handbag, transitive verb (of a woman politician), treat
(a person, idea etc.) ruthlessly or insensitively.''

<HEADLINE> Protesters Seek Bomb Exercise Halt  </HEADLINE>
By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- With inert U.S. Navy bombs falling
on the Vieques bombing range, 100 activists headed for the island
Monday to obstruct the exercise, the latest in a series of military
operations that have come to dominate Puerto Rican politics.
</P>
<P>
   Guards arrested six demonstrators inside the Vieques training
ground Monday during the largest military exercises here since a
fatal bombing accident in 1999 sparked widespread protests.
</P>
<P>
   One man was arrested inside the 900-acre target zone on the
eastern tip of Vieques, said Navy spokesman Bob Nelson. The
protester wasn't hurt, and it wasn't immediately known if
non-explosive shelling and bombing were occurring at the time of
the arrest, Nelson said. The other five were arrested on horseback
outside the target zone.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 activists from the Puerto Rican Independence Party
left the main island of Puerto Rico for Vieques, vowing to trespass
onto the range. But on Vieques itself, reaction to the exercise was
surprisingly muted -- perhaps reflecting the wear and tear of a
yearlong battle to oust the Navy from its Atlantic Fleet training
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Few protesters gathered outside the gates to the Navy's Camp
Garcia as ships attached to the USS George Washington Battle Group
fired inert shells into the zone about 9 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The exercises began Sunday and could run through July 2. Navy
warnings to fishermen were posted and broadcast by radio Saturday
night, surprising many islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be heard at Camp Garcia's gates Monday, although
one resident had claimed Sunday that the shelling shook her house.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a civilian Puerto Rican guard was killed on the range
by two bombs -- the first fatality in six decades of bombing. The
accident united Puerto Ricans in demanding that the Navy abandon
Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders say years of live bombing -- including the use of
napalm -- have destroyed wildlife and fishing grounds, contaminated
water supplies, impeded tourism and created what they say is a high
cancer rate.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy disagrees and says Vieques is the only place its
Atlantic fleet can hold simultaneous land, air and sea exercises
with live fire before deploying abroad. This week's exercises will
certify the George Washington Battle Group's combat readiness
before a six-month tour of the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Navy briefly bombed and shelled the zone days after
federal agents peacefully removed 224 protesters. Protest leaders
heard no bombing and claimed the Navy was lying; the Navy said it
had proved its argument that the exercises don't harm 9,400
civilians who live in the middle third of the 21-mile-long island.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 people have since been arrested inside the
training ground, including 38 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After negotiations with Puerto Rico's government and the Navy,
President Clinton has ordered the Navy to resume limited training
using non-explosive bombs and shells. The Navy must abandon Vieques
by May 2003 if Vieques residents vote to expel it in a referendum
expected next year. If the Navy wins, it gets to use live munitions
again.
</P>
<P>
   A Puerto Rican lawmaker warned Monday that the protests could
jeopardize the referendum because Puerto Rico, under Clinton's
directive, pledged to keep protesters off Navy property.
</P>
<P>
   ''These demonstrations could give the Navy the perfect excuse to
say we are not complying and abandon the agreement,'' said
Representative Lourdes Ramos of the incumbent pro-statehood New
Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican leaders said they plan to bring up Vieques on
Wednesday, when Clinton meets with leaders from Puerto Rico's three
main political parties to talk about a possible referendum offering
statehood, independence or other options to the U.S. Caribbean
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vieques is too fundamental and serious to have a meeting with
the president ... and not talk about it,'' Sila Calderon, president
of the Popular Democratic Party, was quoted as saying by El Nuevo
Dia newspaper. ''This issue goes to the very fiber of our being.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she will present Clinton with a letter of complaint
from Vieques residents.

   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- A large natural gas field recently

supply Palestinian areas as well as neighboring countries,
Palestinian officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Rashid, an economic aide to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, wouldn't say exactly how large the natural gas field is.
But he said it is big enough to also supply Israel, Jordan, and
Lebanon.

   The Gaza Strip -- along southern Israel's coast and adjacent to
the Egyptian border -- is jointly administered by Israel and the
Palestinian Authority. Another large natural gas field was found in
the area in September, during a search for an ancient shipwreck off
the coast of Israel, Gaza and Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Standard &AMP; Poor's downgrades Beth Israel debt to junk bond status  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Beth Israel Medical Center needs emergency
treatment for poor financial health, according to Standard &AMP;
Poor's, which lowered debt ratings on the hospital Monday to double
'B'-minus from triple 'B'-plus.
</P>
<P>
   The lower grade reduces the hospital's debt rating to junk bond
status, making it harder for the non-profit institution to raise
money to operate its 1,250 beds on two campuses in Manhattan and
one in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's also placed the hospital on CreditWatch, an
S&AMP;P designation bestowed on fewer than 1 percent of the companies
and institutions followed by the largest provider of debt ratings
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   To escape from CreditWatch, Beth Israel must prove within a
month that it can obtain the release of some of its substantial
mortgage and bond-related funds and has a healthy budget plan, said
Liz Sweeney, S&AMP;P's director in public finance ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mandler, a Beth Israel spokesman, said the hospital
understood the financial industry's concerns about changes in
health care that put additional strain on the finances of
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, we at Beth Israel Medical Center feel very
confidently that changes we have made to our budget and our
financial picture and other initiatives under consideration will
ease the financial industry's concern,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he believed the downgrade of Beth Israel's bonds
was a ''temporary measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Israel has announced it will lay off 500 people beginning
Saturday, saving $54 million annually. Besides its beds, the
hospital also operates an extensive network of ambulatory
facilities and physician practices in Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten
Island, Brooklyn and Westchester and Rockland counties.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P said in a release that Beth Israel's weak 1999 operating
performance seemed to be worse in the first few months of 2000,
leaving the hospital with just $16 million of unrestricted cash by
March 31. That, according to the release, was equal to six days of
operating expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said the hospital's finances were in serious enough
condition that there probably was no quick fix.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will take them a long time to turn this around,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the hospital has not cut costs quickly enough after the
state deregulated hospital rates several years ago and after Beth
Israel faced greater competition from managed health care programs.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals in New York City tend to be among the weakest
financially in the country, in part because patient length of stays
are longer than they should be and because the overall practice of
medicine is inefficient, Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   She said one cause of this is the linkage between many New York
hospitals and teaching institutions. Beth Israel, for instance, is
affiliated with the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Students, she said, tend to be extra cautious in ordering tests
and other costly aspects of the job.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very expensive system,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Con Ed Has High-Load Day -- Asks for Help  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Consolidated Edison said that Monday was the
heaviest electricity usage day so far this year - an indicator that
the blistering heat of summer has arrived in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Usage was so high it reached the third-highest level ever, and
led the utility to ask several large customers on the Upper East
Side of Manhattan - including Mount Sinai Hospital - to switch to
their own generators to ease the power load in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The day's citywide high for the utility was 11,231 megawatts -
reached at 5 p.m., said Con Ed spokesman Joe Petta. The high
temperature for the day was 88 and the low was 74 degrees,
according to the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed's all-time power usage high, 11,850 megawatts, was hit
last July 6, the day of the Washington Heights blackout. The
second-highest usage was also in July of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''As summer continues, we will be issuing more messages about
conserving energy,'' Petta said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a couple feeders went out in the East Side's
Yorkville section, forcing Con Ed to reduce the voltage in the
entire Yorkville area by 8 percent to ease the load. The areas
affected are from Fifth Avenue to Lexington Avenue and from East
78th Street to East 110th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The utility is asking customers to use only essential electrical
appliances. Crews were working to correct the problem, Petta said.

<HEADLINE> Six years later, decayed Southern Tier bridges still unrepaired  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) - Six years after a state report said 13
Broome County rail bridges showed signs of decay or serious
deterioration, state and county officials say little has been done
to repair them.
</P>
<P>
   Responsibility for railroad bridge safety rests with the rail
companies that own the tracks, though federal officials do have
authority to remove a bridge from service or shut down a railroad
for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the 1994 state Department of Transportation study
of 35 railroad crossings in Broome County, most of the rail
crossings were owned by the former Conrail Inc., which broke up and
sold its local tracks to Norfolk Southern Railway last year.
</P>
<P>
   The crossings were rated on a scale of 1 through 7, with 1 being
a ''potentially hazardous'' structure and 7 being a bridge in new
condition. Of the 35 studied, eight received a 3 rating, indicating
''serious deterioration or not functioning as originally
designed.'' Another five received a 2 rating, meaning the structure
falls somewhere between serious and potentially hazardous.
</P>
<P>
   County officials are planning to overhaul one of the crossings
given a ''2'' rating, but there are no known plans for the other
three.
</P>
<P>
   Of those three, one is located in Johnson City, another in
Binghamton, and a third in the town of Chenango.
</P>
<P>
   The Binghamton and Johnson City structures are part of the
Norfolk Southern operation, while the smaller Chenango crossing
carries lines owned by New York Susquehanna and Western Railroad
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Railroad company officials did not return calls for comment.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It looks like the NFL will have a television
camera on the field -- affixed to the cap of one of the officials.
</P>
<P>
   The camera, called ''UmpireCam,'' was used by FOX in its
coverage of NFL Europe's World Bowl on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's going to work well,'' NFL commissioner Paul
Tagliabue said during the telecast. ''We're going to experiment
with it during the preseason and if works well, probably use it
during the regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL also is considering a plan to let its broadcasters put
miniature cameras inside helmets and wire its players with
microphones during exhibition games. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said
earlier this month no decision has been made.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the World Wrestling Federation announced that its new
football league, the XFL, planned to use miniature cameras in
helmets of some players and microphones in huddles and on the
sidelines. NBC plans to televise the XFL games, scheduled to start
in February.

<HEADLINE> Package of gun safety bills closer to becoming law  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state Assembly Monday increased the
legal age to buy handguns, toughened the mandatory penalty for
committing a crime with one and created a special prosecutor to
track gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates said it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from the Assembly agenda were components of a Senate
package that advocates touted as key gun safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   Laws that would require every new handgun to be outfitted with
''smart-gun'' technology and have its ballistic fingerprint
registered with police have stalled with only one session left
before the summer recess.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are all good measures but they're insufficient. None of
them deal with the access kids have to guns,'' said Bryan Miller,
director of Cease Fire New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly on Monday passed only one of four bills
overwhelmingly approved by the Senate on May 18. Before that vote
organizers of the Million Mom March vowed to pressure Assembly
leaders to act, especially on the bill requiring the ''smart-gun''
safety locks.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate agreed to mandate that ''smart-gun'' safety locks be
equipped on every new gun sold in New Jersey. The measure would
require that technology, which would only allow a gun's owner to
fire the weapon, once it is available.
</P>
<P>
   Another measure would spend $5 million to help prosecutors
supplement enforcement of current gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   And the Senate passed a bill requiring every new handgun to
undergo a ballistics test so police could later track bullets fired
from the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   New York last week became the first state in the nation to
demand ballistics tests when its Legislature passed a similar
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Of the bills sponsored by Senate President Donald T.
DiFrancesco, R-Union, only the measure making 21 the legal age to
buy a handgun passed the Assembly and now heads to the governor's
desk.
</P>
<P>
   Last year a similar Senate bill from DiFrancesco mandating the
''smart-guns'' died when the Assembly did not take it up.
</P>
<P>
   This time DiFrancesco said the Assembly had the chance to
consider a package of bills, not just the gun lock proposal. The
senate president said Monday he hoped Assembly members would
eventually get to vote on his bills.
</P>
<P>
   If not now, then possibly in the fall, DiFrancesco said.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Assembly does not vote, members could face
repercussions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think these bills are supported by a large coalition of
people across the state. They'll have to deal with it,''
DiFrancesco said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman supports ''smart gun'' development and she
backs the proposals offered by DiFrancesco, spokeswoman Jayne
O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, R-Salem, said his house has not
voted on the Senate bills because they have not cleared committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill A-11, which raises the mandatory minimum sentence for
crimes committed with handgun to five years from three, passed the
Assembly by a vote of 67-6.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to create a special state prosecutor for gun crimes,
A-12, passed the Assembly 78-0.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly members also voted for a measure, A-10, that requires
police departments to destroy old firearms instead of trading them
in for new ones.
</P>
<P>
   These measures now head to the Senate for consideration.

<HEADLINE> Army Reveals Olympic Security Role  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL FOY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The U.S. Army will provide expertise and
equipment to help safeguard the 2002 Winter Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to have a concern for possible acts of terrorism,''
Army Secretary Louis Caldera said Monday after taking a helicopter
tour of Olympic venues.
</P>
<P>
   The Army, a partner in the Utah Public Safety Command for the
Olympics, can help fight terrorism by providing aircraft for SWAT
teams, advanced communications, bomb squads and bomb-sniffing dogs,
fences and barriers, security sensors and metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may be asked to do more,'' Caldera said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army secretary, a civilian, used his Gulfstream jet to fly
to Salt Lake City with two of President Clinton's assistants and a
transportation undersecretary.
</P>
<P>
   They hopped on three Blackhawk helicopters with Salt Lake
Organizing Committee president Mitt Romney and other Olympic
organizers for a tour of competition venues from Ogden to Park
City.
</P>
<P>
   Federal laws prohibit Army deployment in civil affairs inside
the United States. But it's not unusual for the Army -- working
under civil authorities -- to get involved in security behind the
scenes or in the event of a disaster, Caldera said.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackhawk tour included Utah native Mickey Ibarra, who is
President Clinton's director of intergovernmental affairs; Thurgood
Marshall Jr., son of the late Supreme Court justice and Clinton's
cabinet secretary; and Peter ''Jack'' Basso, assistant secretary
and chief financial officer for the U.S. Department of
Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The federal officials praised each others' work on a 20-agency
White House Olympic task force headed by Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But those same appointees won't be around if Gore doesn't win
the November election for president.
</P>
<P>
   So could the federal effort come unraveled if Gore doesn't win?
</P>
<P>
   ''Not at all,'' Caldera said. ''You have the commitment of the
federal government regardless of what happens in November, and you
have wonderful career people doing all this coordination and ground
work, and I'm sure they will follow through on the commitments
President Clinton has made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera received a series of briefings on the games and learned
that security planning was 80 percent complete.
</P>
<P>
   That puts Utah Public Safety Commissioner Craig Dearden's effort
farther ahead in Olympic planning than any previous host city,
Ibarra said.

<HEADLINE> Warning May Have Saved Some Jews  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- British and American intelligence agents had
information in 1943 that could have been used to save some Italian
Jews from the Nazis' Auschwitz death camp, historians said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference releasing some 400,000 pages of newly
declassified documents at the National Archives, historians said
Western officials might have been able to warn Jews in Rome that
they were about to be rounded up and deported.
</P>
<P>
   The declassified documents from the Office of Strategic Services
(OSS), the World War II forerunner to the CIA, included messages of
the Nazi SS security service between Berlin and Rome in late 1943
that were intercepted and decoded by British intelligence and
shared with U.S. intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   They also included conversations among German POWs secretly
recorded by the British and information gathered by the OSS using
an anti-Nazi German informant.
</P>
<P>
   The intercepted messages showed Nazi security forces were
planning to seize Jews in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ''The release...raises the historical question once again of
what Allied governments knew about the Holocaust during World War
II and what might have been done with information they possessed,''
said historian Richard Breitman in a report he co-authored for the
U.S. government's Nazi War Criminals Records Interagency Working
Group.
</P>
<P>
   The co-author of the report, historian Timothy Naftali, said
perhaps British Prime Minister Winston Churchill or American
President Franklin Roosevelt should have made a statement warning
the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear that had a statement been made on the radio to the
effect that Allied forces feared for the safety of Romans, and
particularly the Jews of Rome, this might well have had an effect
on decisions made by people to get out,'' Naftali said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find it disheartening that there was no more use of some of
this information at the time,'' said Breitman.
</P>
<P>
   But Naftali also warned against a ''rush to conclusions.'' He
and others said it is unclear in hindsight whether taking action on
the information would have compromised British intelligence
gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Others said it was unclear whether Jews could have acted on the
information had they received it.
</P>
<P>
   The interagency working group was established in January 1999 to
coordinate a large-scale effort by U.S. federal agencies to find,
declassify and release U.S. records relating to Germany's Nazi
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agencies have resisted opening their files for half a
century, saying national security was at stake. Supporters says the
panel's work provides an insight into how U.S. intelligence
agencies and others used Nazi war criminals in the Cold War years.
</P>
<P>
   Historians said this was the most significant finding by the
panel, which has released more than one million pages of documents
gathered from the Department of Defense, the OSS, Justice, State,
FBI and other agencies.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Russia Premier Denies Bribe Link  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Former Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin on
Monday denied media reports linking him to Swiss firms suspected of
paying bribes for lucrative Kremlin construction work.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, speaking on the Russian television program Hero of
the Day, dismissed the allegations as ''nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   A Swiss judge said in Geneva on Monday that he had charged three
people in the case, and planned to confront two contractors,
Mabetex and Mercata Trading, suspected of paying the bribes.
Investigating Judge Daniel Devaud refused to identify the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian weekly Novaya Gazeta reported Monday that Geneva
prosecutors were preparing to name Chernomyrdin and former
President Boris Yeltsin's daughter Tatyana Dyachenko in the case.
There have been allegations that Yeltsin and his two daughters were
issued credit cards guaranteed by Mabetex, which the family denies.
</P>
<P>
   Novaya Gazeta also ran interviews Monday with an unnamed
high-ranking Swiss police official and Swiss prosecutor saying they
had evidence that Chernomyrdin had tens of millions of dollars
transferred to his Swiss bank account by Mercata.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin said that, as prime minister from 1992-98, he never
dealt with the construction companies and had no Swiss accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no bank accounts in Switzerland, but I wish I did,''
Chernomyrdin said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Devaud has issued an arrest warrant for former Kremlin
property manager Pavel Borodin, charging him with money-laundering
through Swiss banks. Russian prosecutors allege that Mabetex
overcharged for Kremlin renovation work to pay $11 million in
kickbacks to a Swiss bank account controlled by Borodin.
</P>
<P>
   Borodin has denied any wrongdoing, as have Mabetex and Mercata.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox, Pedro Martinez Hurting  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Even when he's hurt, Pedro Martinez is one of the
best pitchers in baseball. Boston Red Sox fans want to find out
just how badly he's injured.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez says he's OK. Teammates disagree. One thing is certain:
for now they can't count on him as the savior of a battered
pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he made his fourth start since missing a turn with a
strained oblique muscle in his left side. Boston lost 6-5 in 13
innings as Toronto completed a three-game sweep that put the Blue
Jays in first place in the AL East by 2 games over the New York
Yankees and 2&AMP;frac12; over the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Boston was off Monday before starting a three-game series at
home Tuesday against Baltimore. Martinez's next scheduled start is
Friday night at the Chicago White Sox, but there was no word on his
chances of pitching then.
</P>
<P>
   There was no update Monday on Martinez's condition, Red Sox
spokesman Kevin Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   ''How did Pedro say he felt?'' Shea asked.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said ''it was just a bad day,'' but relief pitcher Rod
Beck and catcher Scott Hatteberg said it was clear Martinez was
ailing.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the staff struggled as Boston dropped seven of its
last nine games. Two pitchers in the original starting rotation are
gone -- an injured Jeff Fassero to the disabled list and an
ineffective Brian Rose to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   So it's up to Pete Schourek, who is 2-6 with a 4.32 ERA, to stop
the three-game slide Tuesday. If he fails, Ramon Martinez (6-4,
5.75) gets a chance Wednesday. On Thursday, it's Tim Wakefield
(2-5, 5.46), who complained about not being used as the emergency
starter in last Friday's loss at Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez, who didn't get the decision Sunday, is 9-3
overall and leads the majors with a 1.44 ERA. But he's 1-1 in the
four starts since missing his turn.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Trot Nixon is sidelined with a hamstring problem, Nomar
Garciaparra went 1-for-7 Sunday and made his fourth error in a week
and Carl Everett misplayed a fly ball in the 13th inning for a
three-base error that led to the winning run. Boston left two
runners on base in four of the last five innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox dropped into third for the first time since May 2,
but the Orioles are in a worse slump. They've lost nine straight
games and are tied with Tampa Bay for the AL East cellar.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston is aiming for the top of the division and without a
healthy Martinez, its chances plummet.
</P>
<P>
   He was 8-2 with a 1.05 ERA with three complete games and three
homers allowed in his first 10 starts. After skipping his turn June
3, the tally in his last four starts is less impressive: a 1-1
record, 2.51 ERA and six homers given up, three in each of the last
two starts.
</P>
<P>
   But is he hurt?
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, a fierce competitor, won't admit it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good hitters,'' he said, explaining Toronto's homers.
''I'm human.''

<HEADLINE> Senate bill seeks to ban bear hunts in New Jersey  </HEADLINE>
By HANAH CHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - If it were up to the state Senate, bear
hunts would have been banned in New Jersey under a bill that passed
with bipartisan support Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Assembly is not likely to act on the measure before the
summer recess begins this week and the Whitman administration is
ready to allow the first bear hunt in New Jersey in 29 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would overturn the New Jersey Fish and Game
Council's unanimous vote last week to allow a limited bear hunt.
The bill passed 31-7 and now heads to the Assembly for action. A
similar bill has languished in the Assembly Natural Resources
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly is expected to go into recess after Thursday's
session, but could return for special sessions before the proposed
bear season in September.
</P>
<P>
   The bill sponsor, Sen. Louis Bassano, R-Union, said even without
Assembly action on his bear-hunting ban, a message has been sent to
the Fish and Game Council that at least one house of the
Legislature objects.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope they get the message, and we won't need further
action,'' Bassano said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also requires the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection and the Humane Society to develop a bear
population management program.
</P>
<P>
   The Fish and Game Council cleared the way for the first hunt
since 1971 in an effort to reduce the state's burgeoning bear
population. Reported incidents of contact between bears and humans
have increased dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of many northern New Jersey communities complain that
the bears invade back yards, kill pets and scare children.
Complaints of damage by black bears have soared from 285 in 1995 to
1,659 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have tried ''aversion conditioning'' to scare
off bears with pepper spray or rubber buckshot and urged residents
not to feed the bears and to bring their garbage indoors at night.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, there were less than 100 black bears in New
Jersey. It is estimated that more than 1,100 bears now live in 11
of the state's 21 counties.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman's original proposal called for a total of
350 bears to be killed in the first year's hunt, but that was
reduced to 175.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the bear population in residential areas has
grown in part because of residential development in former rural
areas. Hunting seasons in neighboring New York and Pennsylvania may
have also pushed bears to New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> SLA Verdicts Expected Tuesday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- A military court wrapped up the cases
Monday of 59 people accused of collaborating with Israel during its
22 years operating in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Verdicts were expected by early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants were among 131 people who were brought before the
court earlier this week. Decisions on the remaining defendants in
the group, the eighth batch brought before the court in the past
few weeks, were deferred to July.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 2,200 fighters or ex-members of the 2,500-strong
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army were captured or surrendered to
the Lebanese authorities after Israel's May withdrawal from
southern Lebanon. The rest -- many of them high-ranking militia
officials -- fled to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon regards itself as technically at war with Israel, and
former SLA members are considered collaborators. Most of those
sentenced so far have received one-year prison terms; some were
handed 15-year sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Some Lebanese had joined the SLA voluntarily; others served to
earn a living in the economically depressed border zone or were
recruited under the threat of imprisonment or expulsion of their
families.

<HEADLINE> Twins 10, Angels 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Matt Lawton, Ron Coomer and Jay Canizaro
each homered and had two RBIs in the Minnesota Twins' 10-6 victory
over the Anaheim Angels on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Radke (5-9), who won for only the second time in seven
starts, allowed two runs and six hits in six innings. He struck out
two and walked two as the Twins salvaged a split of the four-game
series.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrod Washburn (3-2), who gave up only three earned runs in 22
1-3 innings in his previous three outings, allowed eight runs and
eight hits in 3 1-3 innings -- his shortest outing in 30 major
league starts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the runs off the left-hander was unearned because of a
throwing error by Scott Spiezio, who started his third straight
game at third base because of Troy Glaus' back spasms.
</P>
<P>
   Radke, who entered tied with teammate Joe Mays for the most
losses in the AL, was bailed out of a bases-loaded jam in the first
by Cristian Guzman. The shortstop made a diving stop of Bengie
Molina's grounder in the hole to rob him of a single and end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota scored its first five runs in the second inning on a
two-run single by Denny Hocking, RBI singles by Chad Moeller and
Canizaro and Guzman's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins increased their lead to 7-0 in the third when Lawton
led off with his fourth homer and Coomer followed with his 10th,
one of his three hits Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn left after Moeller led off the fourth with a single and
stole second as Jason Maxwell struck out. Canizaro reached on
Spiezio's error, and reliever Lou Pote surrendered two-out RBI
singles by Lawton and Coomer for a 9-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Canizaro greeted Angels reliever Derrick Turnbow with a leadoff
homer in the sixth to make it 10-2. It was the 61st homer this
season by the Twins, the fewest in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Palmeiro tripled in the third inning and scored
Anaheim's first run on Mo Vaughn's groundout to Radke up the
third-base line. In the fifth, Darin Erstad singled and came all
the way around on Palmeiro's double.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored four runs in the eighth against Hector
Carrasco, who has surrendered 15 earned runs in his last 12
innings. Garret Anderson led off with his 21st homer, matching his
career high. Spiezio hit an RBI triple and Adam Kennedy and Edgar
Clemente added RBI singles.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Coomer's three-hit game was his team-high eighth this
season. ... It was the fourth time Minnesota hit back-to-back
homers. ... Moeller, 3-for-4 with a walk, had his first career
multihit game. ... Right fielder Midre Cummings could have held
Palmeiro's triple to a single, but instead chose to dive for a ball
he had no chance of catching with his team ahead 7-0. ... Kennedy
leads AL rookies with 83 hits, 36 RBIs, 11 stolen bases and 72
games played. ... The Twins, who entered the AL with the Angels in
the 1961 expansion, are 279-293. ... Washburn threw 37 pitches
during Minnesota's five-run second inning. When the Twins scored
five runs in the sixth on Sunday night, Brian Cooper and Al Levine
combined to make 39 pitches. ... Coomer has made only two errors at
first base in 514 total chances.

<HEADLINE> Committees OK new budget without dissent, laying ground for easy final votes </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Senate and Assembly committees approved the
proposed $21.5 billion state budget Monday with little dissent and
no controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democrat on the Assembly budget committee, Barbara
Buono, D-Middlesex, complained that too little is being done in
times of such rich revenues to ease the burdens on middle-class
families who face high property taxes and increasing college
tuitions.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Buono referred to the spending total -
up 10 percent from the budget signed 12 months ago - as
''unimaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Buono and her Democratic colleagues on the committee
promptly voted ''yes,'' joining the sponsoring Republicans to
approve the budget 11-0. The Senate budget committee did the same,
8-0.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's vote outcomes forecast that overall approval was
virtually certain Thursday with votes to spare. If a large bloc of
Democrats or, for that matter, a fringe group of Republicans had
intended to raise a major objection to a core budget item, it would
likely have surfaced during Monday's committee action.
</P>
<P>
   The budget bill appropriates $21.48 billion and also takes in
and dispenses $8 billion in federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Amendments to the budget Thursday would be tricky but are
possible. After that, the budget goes to Gov. Christie Whitman's
desk.
</P>
<P>
   The governor will have until midnight Friday to announce any
line-item vetoes of individual budget appropriations - she is one
of the few chief executives in the United States with this
authority - and then sign it into law in time for the new 2000-2001
fiscal year that begins at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The budget increases funding by $157 million for the 30
so-called ''special needs'' districts defined in the Abbott v.
Burke court rulings. The governor's budget in January had proposed
only $104 million in added funding.
</P>
<P>
   Overall school aid will hit $6.65 billion, with $2.75 billion of
it earmarked specifically for the Abbott districts where the
Supreme Court has ordered ''parity'' with the amount spent on
pupils in the state's 100 wealthiest school systems.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also spends $701 million for the Transportation Trust
Fund, lowering the amount that will need to be financed with
long-term bonds.
</P>
<P>
   There are some indirect budget tricks involving more than $700
million that is being spent on state programs but does not show up
in the $21.5 billion budget, according to the bill approved by the
two committees Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the budget shows the state is cutting money to
county-owned retirement and nursing homes by $251 million.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is no cut at all. The state is sending less of
its revenue for that purpose and replacing it with a special grant
of federal funds through the Medicaid program. Even though the
fiscal maneuver permitting this application for extra federal
dollars has yet to be approved by federal agencies, the $21.5
billion budget treats these funds as if they are already in the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   The state is also spending $245 million on hospital aid, a new
subsidized health insurance program for working families and a new
prescription drug program for seniors who do not qualify for
current state programs. None of these items appears in the $21.5
billion budget. They are being paid for out of the tobacco
settlement revenue that is being kept ''off budget.''
</P>
<P>
   These two items alone would inflate the state budget to $22
billion. Further, some $208 million in additional state spending
received initial Senate and Assembly committee approval Monday, but
these expenditures will be counted against the current fiscal-year
budget ending Friday night even though the cash is not moving out
until later.

<HEADLINE> Aides resign in wake of misconduct charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Two aides resigned from a state-run
residential facility for mental patients rather than face
departmental charges they had drinking parties and sex with two
patients. The parents of one victim say they are suing the state.
</P>
<P>
   Mental Hygiene Aides William Gabel and Ronald Lawton were
charged with misdemeanor counts of unlawful dealing with a child.
The two men, both in their early 50s, have pleaded innocent to the
criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   The two worked at the Pathways residence in Collins, 27 miles
south of Buffalo, one of four such facilities operated in Western
New York by Buffalo Psychiatric Center.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Coffey, director of administrative services at the
Center, said the two patients involved were a 19-year-old from
Hamburg and a 33-year-old Buffalo-area man.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lawton and Gabel are accused of taking patients to their
homes, giving them wine and liquor and having sex with them.
</P>
<P>
   Both are also accused of having sex with the younger patient in
his room at the facility on numerous occasions.
</P>
<P>
   According to Coffey, Gabel and Lawton resigned about three weeks
ago after being confronted with the allegations and told that they
would face disciplinary charges. He emphasized that there was ''no
coverup'' of the allegations by state officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''We aggressively conducted our own investigation, and we very
quickly brought in the State Police after learning of these
allegations on May 9,'' Coffey said.

<HEADLINE> Greek president, Putin Meet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin said in talks with his
Greek counterpart Monday that Yugoslavia's Kosovo province must be
demilitarized and called for greater cooperation in Europe to bring
stability to the region.
</P>
<P>
   Putin toned down recent Russian support of Slobodan Milosevic,
saying that even though the Yugoslav president should be involved
in Kosovo affairs, ''that doesn't mean that the world community
should accept all that happens in that region,'' the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow vehemently opposed NATO's air campaign in 1999 to end
Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, and cut ties
with the alliance in protest. Some Russian hard-liners had
advocated direct military aid to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia immediately sent peacekeepers into the province after
the campaign ended, and Putin, elected president March 26, oversaw
Russia's restoring ties with NATO earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   A delegation of Yugoslav military officials, led by air force
chief Col. Gen. Spasoje Smiljainc, was to arrive in Moscow on
Monday to discuss defense issues and the possibility of training
Serbian officers in Russia, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's comments Monday came during talks with Greek President
Constantinos Stephanopoulos, in which he said Greece and other
countries in southeastern Europe should work more closely together
to solve problems in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Although a member of NATO, Greece has found common ground with
Russia on the former Yugoslavia, in part because Russia, Serbia and
Greece share a common Orthodox Christian religious heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Putin and Stephanopoulos also discussed Russia's proposed
anti-missile defense system, which is a response to American
proposals to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty so it can
build a limited national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Russia opposes amending the treaty and Putin has offered a
system he says could be built without changing the accord, though
details haven't been made known.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos said Greece ''takes most seriously Russia's
proposal for creating a pan-European anti-missile system,''
Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> UN Reports Israel Border Violations  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon
reported half a dozen Israeli border violations Monday, backing
Lebanese government claims that Israel's troops have been violating
the withdrawal line drawn by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council called for an immediate end to the
violations, but council president Jean-David Levitte of France
stressed that they were minor and expressed hope they would be
cleared up in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Israeli army's withdrawal from southern Lebanon last
month, the Lebanese government has repeatedly accused Israeli
troops of violating the U.N. line, which was drawn as a temporary
border between the two nations. There have also been frequent
border incidents, with Lebanese demonstrators taunting Israeli
soldiers and pelting them with stones.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago, the United Nations said it had verified that
Israel had completely withdrawn from Lebanese territory. That
verification won endorsement from the U.N. Security Council on June
18.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, in its first report since the verification, the
peacekeeping force cited only Israeli violations.
</P>
<P>
   In four instances, the Israeli army is still using patrol roads
cutting into Lebanese territory. Israeli soldiers were seen in
trenches on the Lebanese side of the border and three Israeli
machine gun posts and some observation equipment were still in
Lebanon, the report said. One Lebanese claim of Israeli
encroachment was found not to be a violation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all agreed in the Security Council that these violations
should be corrected as soon as possible,'' said France's U.N.
Ambassador Jean-David Levitte, the current council president.
''Most of them are very limited violations, and I guess they will
be corrected in the coming hours and days.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and occupied part of southern
Lebanon as a buffer against guerrilla attacks on northern Israel
from 1985 until its withdrawal on May 24. Under 1978 Security
Council resolutions, U.N. peacekeeping troops were charged with
verifying any Israeli pullout, and after they did so, the
4,500-strong U.N. peacekeeping force in the region was supposed to
deploy to the border area.
</P>
<P>
   Levitte said the Lebanese government wants to be sure there are
no more violations of the withdrawal line before giving ''a green
light'' for deployment of the force.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council hopes ''it's a matter of hour or days at
most'' before the force, which is expected to increase to 5,600
next month, can be deployed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government is already sending teams of armed forces
and police to southern Lebanon, and the council doesn't anticipate
any difficulties in coordinating the U.N. deployment with them, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the Security Council held its first-ever
video-conferencing meeting: It talked to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, who reported from Geneva on his recent seven-nation
Mideast trip, including stops in Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said the secretary-general reported that
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is determined to see an end to
border violations, but Annan was not certain the lower ranks of the
army had the same degree of conviction. Annan suggested to Barak
that a high-ranking officer be placed in charge of the Lebanese
border area to ensure that Israeli soldiers don't cross the
withdrawal line, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the minor Israeli violations, council members were
upbeat and commended the secretary-general for putting the
situation in Lebanon back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ''The secretary-general made progress in having ... recognition
throughout the region that Israel has withdrawn from Lebanon,''
deputy U.S. ambassador Nancy Soderberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan also succeeded in convincing the Lebanese that the
Israelis have withdrawn and the incidents should be treated as
violations, she said.
</P>
<P>
   British U.N. Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said the
secretary-general brought the Israeli and Lebanese governments back
to realizing that the U.N. line drawn to verify the withdrawal is
not the international border. The final border remains to be
determined, probably after the two countries sign a peace
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni Leader OKs Saudi Border Pact  </HEADLINE>
By AHMED AL-HAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) -- Yemen's president approved a border
agreement with Saudi Arabia on Monday, but a tribal leader rejected
it and warned that his followers will fight to defend the status
quo.
</P>
<P>
   President Ali Abdullah Saleh's approval comes two days after the
accord, which is aimed at ending decades of border disputes, was
approved by parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheik Mohammed bin Shajeh -- the Yemeni tribal leader of
Waella, an area the new border will split -- told The Associated
Press that he rejects the accord and will sacrifice money and men
to defeat it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who have demarcated the borders, whether experts or
committees, do not know the borders between one tribe and another,
especially the tribes that are divided between the two countries,''
Sheik Mohammed said. ''We have border documents that specify
borders between tribes. These documents are hundreds of years old
and therefore neither Saudi nor Yemeni authorities can ignore
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Large parts of Yemen are lawless, inhabited by tribes that often
kidnap foreigners and use guns to settle scores or express
discontent with the government.
</P>
<P>
   In Saudi Arabia, the Royal Court issued a statement Monday
approving the accord and saying that ''a specialized international
company will prepare the maps for the border line between the two
countries.'' The Saudi Cabinet and consultative council approved
the agreement last week.
</P>
<P>
   The accord, signed June 12 in Saudi Arabia by the two countries'
foreign ministers, demarcates a new frontier across the desert of
the southeastern Arabian peninsula. Under the accord, three
disputed islands will be Yemeni.
</P>
<P>
   The border area has potentially lucrative oil deposits, and the
accord says any natural wealth discovered along the border will be
extracted by both countries.

<HEADLINE> Senate approves new penalties for designer drug  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state Senate voted unanimously Monday
to increase the criminal penalties associated with the designer
drug known as Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month Gov. Christie Whitman urged both houses of
the Legislature to agree with her and ratchet up prison terms for
dealers and users.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officers claim the drug now popular among teens
and young adults at so-called rave parties can cause sudden
illness, including artificially high temperatures that can kill.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman wants to put Ecstasy in the same legal class as heroin
and cocaine. People holding 5 ounces or more - about 500 of pills
that carry a street price tag of $20 - would face a prison term of
up to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   What drug users call Ecstasy is the synthetic compound 3-4
methylene-dioxy-methamphetamine, or MDMA. Other similar compounds
found to be dangerous have sometimes been sold under the same name,
and other nicknames include ''X,'' ''XTC,'' and ''Adam.''
</P>
<P>
   Possessing Ecstasy now rates as a third-degree criminal drug
offense with a maximum prison sentence of five years. State law
sets no degrees of punishment for offenders with increasing amounts
of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law keeps the third-degree offense only for those
caught with less than half an ounce. Offenders with between half an
ounce and 5 ounces would face up to 10 years in prison, a
second-degree crime. Each ounce is about 100 pills.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also provide for warnings to parents and
teen-agers through the state health and education departments about
the risks of Ecstasy. The warning will include letters home and
posters for schools and health facilities.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday bills cleared committees in both the Assembly and
Senate. No vote has been scheduled in the full Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Hewitt OKs '60 Minutes' Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS saves money on retirement plans over at ''60
Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Hewitt, founder of the newsmagazine and still its executive
producer, said Monday he had signed on for four more years after
his current contract expires in six months.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt is 77, or five years younger than correspondent Mike
Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'll think about retiring when his contract is up at 82
-- and then probably sign on for four more years. Bowing out has
never really crossed his mind, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who's got it made more than I have?'' he said. ''It is too
satisfying to me. I can't imagine doing anything that would give me
more satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt's still feisty. He recently lashed out at former ''60
Minutes'' producer Lowell Bergman for participating in the movie,
''The Insider,'' which portrayed Hewitt as pulling punches on a
tobacco story to satisfy corporate interests.

<HEADLINE> 4 Qualify For Olympic Shooting Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Army Capt. Glenn Dubis qualified for his fourth
Olympics as a member of the U.S. shooting team.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Johnson is heading to Sydney, too -- along with her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   Dubis, a 41-year-old member of the marksmanship unit at Fort
Benning, Ga., finished third Monday in the men's prone small bore
rifle competition at the USA Shooting National Championships.
</P>
<P>
   But the two Olympians were selected on the basis of scores at
this event and a spring trial at Fort Benning. Dubis' total of
1,891.3 points was enough to finish second overall to Thomas Tamas,
another member of the Army's Marksmanship Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Dubis went to his first Olympics in 1984 at Los Angeles and also
earned spots on the 1988 and 1996 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Tamas, 35, became a two-time Olympian with a total of 1,894.3
points. A member of the 1992 team, he finished second in Monday's
event to Eric Uptagrafft.
</P>
<P>
   Uptagrafft, of Phenix City, Ala., failed to make the Olympic
team after a mediocre showing at the spring trial.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 26, of Phenix City, will be appearing in her second
straight Olympics after gaining the second spot in women's air
rifle. Her total of 1,282.4 points placed her just behind by Jayme
Dickman, who combined for 1,283.2 points at the two events.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is the wife of Ken Johnson, who qualified for the
Olympic team Friday in men's air rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Dickman, 22, of Sharpsburg, Ga., has made a quick rise after
taking up the sport in 1992. She was an alternate on the 1996 team
in Atlanta and will be competing in her first Olympics at Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Dickman was 11th in Monday's event, while Johnson placed sixth.
Melissa Mulloy, of Fairbanks, Alaska, won the national championship
but finished fifth in the race for the Olympic team with a total of
1,278.1 points.
</P>
<P>
   The championship is being held at Wolf Creek shooting range near
Atlanta, site of the 1996 Olympic shooting events.

<HEADLINE> Lindros Report Out, Findings Not  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A concussion specialist who examined Eric
Lindros completed a medical report on the Philadelphia Flyers star,
but so far there's no word on its conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Kelly released his report Friday, his office said
Monday. A secretary in the office said the Chicago neurologist was
out of the country until July 5, and she would not disclose what
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Sunday, neither the team nor the player had seen the
report. The report was to have been sent to Carl Lindros, the
player's father and agent.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials and Carl Lindros did not return calls from The
Associated Press on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers said Sunday they have given other teams permission to
talk to Lindros, and general manager Bobby Clarke said it was
likely the star center would be elsewhere next season.
</P>
<P>
   But any trade would depend on a clean bill of health for
Lindros, who has been sidelined by six concussions over the past
two years, including four in the final four months of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Lindros said last week his son still had ''symptoms'' from
the latest concussion, though he would not specify what they were.
The latest medical report could recommend that Lindros take a full
season off.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what I'm going to do,'' Eric Lindros told the
Philadelphia Daily News. ''I don't know if I'm going to be cleared
to play. I'm not going to rush into anything. If I'm allowed to
play, that's the first and foremost thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Rangers and the Los Angeles Kings on Sunday
confirmed their interest in Lindros, who has feuded with Flyers
management and received his latest concussion without even playing
a full game after missing 16 games because of a different
concussion.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Maple Leafs were rumored to be a third team to
approach Philadelphia about Lindros. But Leafs general manager Pat
Quinn denied he had approached Clarke about a deal for Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Glen Sather told The Philadelphia
Inquirer on Sunday night he had talked to Lindros about whether he
would consider playing in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have talked to Eric,'' Sather said. ''I asked him how he
felt, and he said he was feeling better every day and that he
wanted to play again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sather said his biggest concern was Lindros' health.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one wants to make a deal if he can't play,'' Sather said.
</P>
<P>
   Sather did not immediately return calls for comment from the AP.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros told The Inquirer he did not give Sather a firm answer
about whether he would move to New York or anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told Glen I don't know if I can play yet,'' Lindros said
from outside Toronto. ''Right now, so much is up in the air. I
myself have to make a decision on whether I will play again and
whether it is worth playing again.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Los Angeles general manager Dave Taylor said he also
talked to Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   ''After receiving authorization from the Philadelphia Flyers, I
telephoned Eric Lindros today and we had a very good discussion,''
Taylor said Monday. ''While I understand that there is a high
degree of media interest in Eric's future, it would be
inappropriate for me to make any additional comment, or to provide
any further update regarding possible future discussions with Eric,
the Lindros family, or the Flyers.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Murder Trial Wrapping Up  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA R. MOSES
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- An attorney charged with killing his
pregnant wife didn't love her, professing his love instead to a
judge with whom he was having an affair, a prosecutor said in his
closing arguments Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right from the beginning, we know Michael Fletcher did not
love Leann,'' Oakland County Assistant Prosecutor Greg Townsend
said, showing the jury e-mail letters that Fletcher sent to Warren
District Judge Susan Chrzanowski.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher, 30, is charged with first-degree murder in Leann
Fletcher's Aug. 16 shooting death. He faces life in prison without
parole if convicted. The jury deliberated for about 3 hours Monday
afternoon and will resume Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Brian Legghio said in his closing argument that
the idea that Fletcher killed his wife to further his affair with
Chrzanowski is far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say he wanted to be with the judge. He was with the
judge. ... If he really wanted to go back with her (Chrzanowski),
she was ready and willing to take him,'' Legghio said.
</P>
<P>
   Chrzanowski testified that she and Fletcher had broken off their
affair in the spring of 1999, but had resumed seeing each other
early in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence allowed over Legghio's objections -- including letters,
e-mails and greeting cards -- revealed affection between Chrzanowski
and Fletcher, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Keep that lovely little chin up, pretty lady,'' Fletcher wrote
to Chrzanowski in one e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors don't think Chrzanowski is connected to the slaying,
but she is under state scrutiny over her assigning thousands of
dollars in indigent cases to Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend Fletcher killed his wife and staged it to
look like an accident or suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know Leann was a young mother ... that she had a zest for
life,'' Townsend said in his closing argument. ''She would never
leave Hannah on her own accord. ... She would never kill herself.''
Hannah is the Fletchers' 3-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher is accused of shooting Ms. Fletcher, 29, in the right
ear with a single shot from a .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol,
shortly after the couple returned from target practice at a nearby
firing range.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher told police he was in the bathroom and his wife was in
the bedroom when he heard a bang. He said he came into the room and
found his wife lying in a pool of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say evidence shows Mrs. Fletcher was shot at close
range. Legghio contends authorities misinterpreted physical
evidence and were too quick to target Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   The defense presented its final piece of evidence Friday: the
911 tape of a hysterical-sounding Fletcher calling police after his
wife's shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Legghio said the tape shows Fletcher did not play a role in Mrs.
Fletcher's death. Prosecutors contended the tape is the final
element of Fletcher's elaborate plan to stage the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland County Circuit Judge Jessica Cooper last week dismissed
one count of assault on a pregnant woman causing miscarriage
against Fletcher, aggreeing with the defense that the charge hadn't
been proved.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Decisions at a Glance  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The Supreme Court took these actions Monday:
<TEXT>
<P>
   --Reinvigorated the landmark 1966 Miranda decision, ruling police
still must warn people they arrest of their ''right to remain
silent'' when questioned. The 7-2 ruling resolved a bitter debate
over criminal suspects' rights and the Supreme Court ruling many
Americans know best. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said the
warning is ''part of our national culture.''
</P>
<P>
   --Threw out California's wide-open primary election process in a
7-2 ruling the dissenters said threatens the primary election
systems in half the states. The court said states violate political
parties' rights when they let primary voters choose nominees by
voting for any candidate, regardless of party affiliation, known as
a ''blanket primary.''
</P>
<P>
   --Ruled 5-4 that juries, not judges, must decide whether someone
charged with a hate crime was motivated by bias and therefore can
be given a higher maximum sentence. The 5-4 decision overturns a
12-year prison sentence imposed on a white New Jersey man who fired
shots into a black family's home.
</P>
<P>
   --Ruled 8-1 that two huge oil companies are entitled to recover
about $158 million from the federal government for an offshore
oil-and-gas deal that never materialized. Mobil and Marathon had
filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit stemming from their ill-fated
attempt to explore for oil and gas off North Carolina's Outer
Banks.
</P>
<P>
   --Agreed to decide whether people can be sued for disclosing the
contents of telephone calls illegally intercepted and recorded by
someone else. Setting the stage for a free-speech ruling with
particular significance for news organizations, the court said it
will use a Pennsylvania case to judge the validity of wiretapping
laws that impose such liability.
</P>
<P>
   --Said it will decide whether people can be arrested for traffic
violations punishable only by a fine. The justices agreed to study
the appeal of a Texas woman who was arrested, handcuffed and jailed
because she and her two children did not use seat belts while
riding in the family pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   --Agreed to referee a voting-rights dispute over a North Carolina
congressional district, possibly to try clarifying how to determine
when race played too large a role in drawing election districts.
The court said will study an appeal in which state officials argue
that politics -- not race -- was the main factor in drawing the 12th
congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   --Set aside a ruling that let public school students in an
Alabama county lead group prayers at graduations, assemblies and
sports events. The justices told a federal appeals court to restudy
the case in light of last week's school-prayer decision in a Texas
case, which said prayer in public schools must be private.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Monday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Twins-Angels:
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Excluding the four expansion teams that entered the
majors after 1992, the only team the Twins have never made a trade
with is the Toronto Blue Jays, who entered the AL in 1977. But
their longest drought without a trade is with the Kansas City
Royals, who dealt Tom Burgmeier to Minnesota for Ken Gill on Oct.
27, 1973. ... The Twins hit back-to-back homers for the fourth time
this season when Matt Lawton and Ron Coomer went deep against
Anaheim's Jarrod Washburn in the third inning Monday. ... RF Midre
Cummings could have held Orlando Palmeiro's triple to a single in
Monday's victory, but instead chose to dive for a ball he had no
chance of catching with his team ahead 7-0. ... Ron Coomer has
committed only two errors at first base in 514 total chances.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: The Angels have not lost more than three consecutive
games this season. But they haven't won more than three in a row,
either -- which is a concern heading into a 10-game stretch against
AL West rivals Seattle (seven games) and Oakland (three) beginning
Tuesday night. ... Mo Vaughn, who has played all 75 games and is
tied with Darin Erstad for the team RBI lead with 57, isn't going
to get a day off from manager Mike Scioscia anytime soon. ''Mo's
had some time DH-ing (five games),'' Scioscia said. ''He feels
that, for him, DH-ing is a day off because he feels like it gives
him that rest he needs. And he responds to that. Mo knows that
he'll get a day off sometime if things are going poorly, or if his
arms are tired or he's not swinging the bat to his capabilities.
So, until there's a situation where he can't function and can't
swing, I expect him to be in the lineup every day.''
Tigers-Indians:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Tigers manager Phil Garner was still singing the
praises of the ''Three Tenors'' following their performance Sunday
night at Cleveland Browns Stadium. ''It was great,'' said Garner,
who attended the concert along with his wife, Carol, and coaches
Bob Melvin and Doug Mansolino. ''We got there at intermission and
got to see the encores. That was the best part.'' ... 3B Dean
Palmer was out of the lineup Monday night because of a strained
groin muscle he sustained in Sunday's game. ''Running is when it
bugs me a little bit,'' said Palmer, who only expects to miss a
couple days. ... RHP Dave Mlicki said he still has headaches caused
by a severe sinus infection. Mlicki, scheduled to start Thursday
against the Yankees, made the three-hour drive back to Detroit
rather than risk flying and worsening his condition.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: RHP Charles Nagy, who had elbow surgery May 19, will
need to make at least two more minor league rehab starts before he
returns to the Indians. ''We want to error on the side of caution
with Charlie,'' GM John Hart said. ''There have been no setbacks.
The pain is diminished. He just doesn't have full strength back
yet.'' ... RHP Paul Shuey, who had hip surgery on May 30, is still
having pain in his hip and will continue to rehab at Double-A
Akron. Shuey has made two one-inning appearances for the Aeros. ...
Despite all the injuries to the pitching staff, Hart said he will
not bring up 19-year-old LHP C.C. Sabathia, the Indians' top
pitching prospect from Akron. ''We want to bring him up when he's
ready,'' Hart said. ''He's flown through our system, but is still
developing. Right now just isn't the time.''
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Marlins-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: SS Alex Gonzalez, who made two errors as a defensive
replacement Sunday, has a bruised middle finger on his right hand
and is day-to-day. ... The Marlins have won 12 series already this
season after taking only 15 last season. ... 2B Luis Castillo
entered the game third in the NL in batting at .367, yet had only
three RBIs in 215 at-bats. One reason is his .162 average with
runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: The Mets aren't looking ahead yet to their four-game
showdown with Atlanta despite all of the attention focused on the
NLCS rematch and John Rocker's return to New York. Reporters from
the three major cable sports news channels were on hand asking
players about the series that begins Thursday. ''We have a big
series with the Marlins. We'll worry about the Braves when they get
here,'' Mike Piazza said. ... SS Rey Ordonez underwent successful
surgery to put a plate into his broken left forearm and conduct a
bone graft. Melvin Mora has as many RBIs (9) in the four weeks
since Ordonez's injury as Ordonez had in the first two months of
the season. ... OF Darryl Hamilton, out since the first week of the
season with a sprained left foot, took BP in Florida and is
expected to begin a rehab assignment Wednesday.
Cardinals-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Disabled 3B Fernando Tatis (groin) and RHP Dave
Wainhouse (shoulder) were sent to Triple-A Memphis on injury rehab
assignments. ... RHP John Ambrose was optioned to Double-A
Arkansas, and RHP Mark Thompson was recalled from Memphis. ... The
Cardinals shuffled their pitching plans for the four-game series
against Cincinnati. Darryl Kile, who pitched only two innings in a
rain-delayed game Saturday, will start Tuesday. ... The Cardinals'
8&AMP;frac12;-game lead over second-place Cincinnati was their biggest since
they were 9&AMP;frac12; up in the NL East on July 23, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: The Reds called up reliever Scott Winchester from
Triple-A Louisville to fill the roster spot of starter Rob Bell,
who was optioned down Sunday. ... To try to snap out of their
losing streak, some of the Reds decided to wear their pants legs
high -- pulled up just below the knee. ... With Pokey Reese slowed
by a sprained ankle and Chris Stynes limited by a pulled hamstring,
manager Jack McKeon let Barry Larkin bat leadoff Monday for the
first time since July 3, 1996 at St. Louis.
Giants-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Left-hander Shawn Estes, scheduled to start
Tuesday night's game, leads the majors in run support at 7.0 per
game (84 runs in 12 starts). Estes is the first major leaguer since
1987 to receive 18 runs of support in two starts in the same
season. ... The Giants and Rockies began a span of eight meetings
in 11 days, but they won't meet again this season. After a
four-game series in Colorado, the teams meet again for a four-game
series July 4-6 in San Francisco, including a day-night
doubleheader July 4. ''I don't understand why we don't play them
again after July 6,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said. ''I'm amazed
that none of us has played an equal number of games within our
division. We haven't played San Diego yet. Colorado hasn't played
San Diego or the Dodgers yet. It's a weird schedule. You would like
to play a division team every day in September. It makes for a
better race.'' ... Barry Bonds' 27 home runs are the most by a
Giants player before the All-Star break since Matt Williams'
club-record 33 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: The Rockies' experiment of having OF Jeffrey Hammonds
bat in the cleanup spot lasted just one game. Hammonds and Jeff
Cirillo switched spots Sunday night in Arizona, but Cirillo was
back at No. 4 and Hammonds at No. 6 for Monday night's game against
San Francisco. ... Colorado already matched its 70 steals for the
entire 1999 season. ... Closer Jerry Dipoto, who had surgery for a
bulging disk in his neck May 3, began throwing Monday.

<HEADLINE> Tigers Sign 13 More Draft Picks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Tigers have agreed to terms with 13
more of their selections from the 2000 draft, the team said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the signees was right-hander Mark Woodyard, the
fourth-round pick. Woodyard was 6-5 with a 4.44 ERA for
Bethune-Cookman. Detroit also signed fifth-round selection Miles
Durham, an outfielder from Texas Tech who hit .343 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Also agreeing to terms were right-handers Andrew Warren (8th
round) from Sam Houston State; Jeremy Johnson (11th round) from
Mooresville, N.C.; and Nathan Tekavec (12th round) from Miami,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the agreements were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers signed their first pick, pitcher Matt Wheatland, on
June 8. Wheatland, the eighth pick overall, is an 18-year-old
senior at San Diego's Rancho Bernardo High School, where he was
11-1 with a 1.94 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Budget bills approved by committees dig too deep into Whitman surplus </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The $21.5 billion state budget approved by
legislative committees Monday digs into Gov. Christie Whitman's
surplus deeper than she told lawmakers she was willing to go.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Whitman is certain to use her line-item veto to cut
upward of $25 million in programs Friday unless the Senate and
Assembly simultaneously agree to chop the bill themselves, or
unless Treasurer Roland Machold decides to increase some of his
revenue forecasts. The Senate and Assembly, facing a Friday
deadline, must vote on the budget Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman can certainly be counted on to use her unique veto power
to cut something. She always has, slicing $5.5 million last year
and $43 million from the Legislature's additions two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But never has the need for the governor's red pen been quite
this obvious ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   While $25 million in cuts may seem like a small matter in a
$21.5 billion budget plan, much of it could come from the pet
projects lawmakers inserted for their home districts for everything
from new fire trucks to summer arts programs.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman spokesman Peter McDonough said cuts could come from
other places, including the funding requests from Whitman's own
agencies, and it could be made up by jiggering revenue projections
upward, since revenues have come in ahead of projections the last
six years.
</P>
<P>
   But McDonough said there is no wiggle room on the surplus. It
must be $850 million, he said, and the budget bill approved by the
Senate and Assembly budget committees Monday provides for only $825
million.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor has maintained her commitment to the $850 million
surplus,'' McDonough said, adding it is essential to satisfy
financing firms on Wall Street that evaluate state finances and use
it as a basis for rating the creditworthiness of state bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of our meetings with rating houses have made it clear an
$850 million surplus is critical to maintaining our bond rating,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attached to the Senate and Assembly budget bills unanimously
approved by both budget committees Monday was a supporting document
from the Office of Legislative Services showing there would be
$1.225 billion left over from this year. This leftover money can
flow into the new fiscal year to be used from the $21.5 billion
budget, leaving a new surplus of $870 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, the $1.225 billion figure was wrong, according to
Treasury Department spokeswoman Mary Lou Murphy. She said the
leftover amount was actually $1.181 million.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy would not comment on the discrepancy. OLS budget director
Alan Kooney said his office had received the figure it used from
the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   One source of confusion over how much will be left over could be
in a separate, $208 million appropriations bill that also passed
both the Senate and Assembly budget committees Monday. This extra
$208 million ties up loose ends in the current budget that expires
at midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Within this $208 million supplement is $44 million extra for
schools, an amount that perhaps should have been deducted from the
leftover totals this year but was not.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers on the Senate and Assembly budget committees did not
speak of the discrepancy during their Monday morning meetings when
most of them were seeing the 282-page budget document for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   The committee votes occurred with little dissent and no
controversy from either party, setting the stage for easy passage
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democrat on the Assembly budget committee, Barbara
Buono, D-Middlesex, complained that too little is being done in
times of such rich revenues to ease the burdens on middle-class
families who face high property taxes and increasing college
tuitions.
</P>
<P>
   But Buono and her Democratic colleagues on the committee
promptly voted ''yes,'' joining the sponsoring Republicans to
approve the budget 11-0. The Senate budget committee did the same,
8-0.
</P>
<P>
   The governor will have until midnight Friday to announce any
line-item vetoes of individual budget appropriations - she is one
of the few chief executives in the United States with this
authority - and then sign it into law in time for the new 2000-2001
fiscal year that begins at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The budget increases funding by $157 million for the 30
so-called ''special needs'' districts defined in the Abbott v.
Burke court rulings. The governor's budget in January had proposed
only $104 million in added funding.
</P>
<P>
   Overall school aid will hit $6.65 billion, with $2.75 billion of
it earmarked specifically for the Abbott districts where the
Supreme Court has ordered ''parity'' with the amount spent on
pupils in the state's 100 wealthiest school systems.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also spends $701 million for the Transportation Trust
Fund, lowering the amount that will need to be financed with
long-term bonds.

<HEADLINE> N.H. Justice Apologizes in Court  </HEADLINE>
By GENE JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- In a final bid to avoid impeachment, New
Hampshire Supreme Court Chief Justice David Brock apologized Monday
for his poor judgment but pleaded with a legislative committee to
spare his job.
</P>
<P>
   ''To the extent my actions as chief justice of the New Hampshire
Supreme Court contributed to the need for this unique historical
process ... I am sorry,'' Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   The state House Judiciary Committee is investigating whether
Brock, Justice John Broderick and Justice Sherman Horton should be
impeached over alleged widespread ethics violations.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses have depicted a pattern of Brock putting the court's
right to confidentiality over the need to report misconduct. The
state's Code of Judicial Conduct requires judges to report
wrongdoing by other judges and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The committee begins deliberating Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Brock is accused of intervening with a lower court judge in a
case involving a state senator -- a charge he denies. He is also
implicated in former Justice Stephen Thayer's attempt to influence
his own divorce case and accused of failing to promptly report
other alleged misconduct by Thayer.
</P>
<P>
   Brock said he had seriously considered resigning, but wanted to
stay to clear the cloud raised by the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''As chief justice, I am responsible for what occurs on my
watch,'' Brock said, adding, ''I never intended to do anything
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock's brief statement followed an hour-long one by his lawyer,
Ralph Lancaster. Lancaster said that while Brock had made mistakes,
they were not impeachable because he did not make them with ''a
black heart or evil intent.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't indict mistakes. You don't indict errors in
judgment,'' Lancaster said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is expected to vote July 5 on whether the justices
should be impeached, reprimanded or cleared. The House will vote on
the committee's recommendation on July 12.

Human Genetic Code Deciphered
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Proclaiming a ''historic point in the 100,000-year record
of humanity,'' scientists announced today that the human genetic code
essentially has been deciphered. Leaders of competing public and private efforts
said at a White House ceremony that they have virtually completed assembly of
what they called ''the book of life'' -- nature's genetic instruction manual for
making and maintaining human beings.

Supreme Court Reaffirms Miranda
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police must keep warning the people they arrest of their
''right to remain silent'' when questioned, according to today's 7-2 Supreme
Court ruling that gave new power to its landmark Miranda decision of 1966. In
another decision, the high court threw out California's open primary system,
saying that allowing voters to cast their ballots for any candidate, regardless
of party, violates the rights of state political parties. Also, the court said
juries, not judges, must decide whether someone charged with a hate crime is
motivated by bias and subject to a maximum sentence.

$1.9 Trillion Surplus Predicted

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton projected a $1.87 trillion budget
surplus for the next decade and asked Republicans to back prescription drugs
benefits in exchange for a tax cut. Sensing a possible election-year trap, GOP
leaders all but scoffed at the proposal. Barely five months after estimating a
10-year surplus of $746 billion, the economy's relentless growth and the
resulting federal revenue let Clinton more than double that figure -- all
without counting Social Security's surpluses.

filed a formal appeal with the full Supreme Court, and asked Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy to keep Elian in the United States until that appeal is acted on.

Cuba Protests US Rules on Diplomats
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Cuban government has complained to U.S. officials,
saying a U.S. refusal to let Cuba's U.N. ambassador travel to Los Angeles to
attend a meeting was politically motivated. In a letter circulated today, Cuba
said the United States imposed travel restrictions on Ambassador Bruno Rodriguez
Parrilla ''arbitrarily and for political motives.'' Rodriguez had wanted to go
to Los Angeles to attend a meeting of the Town Hall Los Angeles Forum, a
respected public policy group. Since Cuba and the United States do not have
diplomatic relations, diplomats of Cuba's U.N. mission have to ask for
authorization to travel outside a 25-mile radius from the center of New York
City.

gave prosecutors until July 5 to provide the information to Lee's lawyers.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Soriano Changes Position  </HEADLINE>
By TIM PUET
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- No one is saying whether Alfonso Soriano's
move to second base with the Class Triple-A Columbus Clippers is
related to Chuck Knoblauch's problems at the position with the
parent New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Soriano and Clippers manager Trey Hillman both said Monday that
Knoblauch's situation never was discussed when the Yankees' front
office asked Soriano to make the move from shortstop last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody mentioned Knoblauch to me,'' Soriano said in Spanish,
with teammate Randall Simon acting as interpreter. ''They just told
me that since it looks like Derek Jeter's going to be over there
(at shortstop) for a while, the best way for me to make it in the
major leagues might be to learn to play another position.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just doing what I was told,'' Hillman said. ''I've been
asked to give Alfonso plenty of extra game time at second base and
I think he's adjusted very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The move was made days after Knoblauch, whose throwing has been
a problem all year, committed three errors in one game. Knoblauch,
a former Gold Glove winner who once had a 47-game errorless streak,
has 14 errors in 50 games at second this season and recently has
been a designated hitter for the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees defensive coordinator Mick Kelleher has been in Columbus
since the decision to switch Soriano was made. He said he was there
specifically because of the conversion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clyde King, special assistant to Yankees owner
George Steinbrenner, was on hand for Monday's International League
game between the Clippers and Ottawa Lynx. He said the visit was
part of his routine of traveling through the farm system and wasn't
related to Soriano's situation.
</P>
<P>
   Soriano and pitcher Ted Lilly both were expected to start
Monday's game, but neither was in the starting lineup. Clippers
spokesman Ben Lewis said he didn't know why either player didn't
start or whether they had been called up to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Soriano, 22, a native of the Dominican Republic, is in his
second year with the Yankees organization and was hitting .285 in
46 games before Monday night, with five homers and 21 runs batted
in.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had played second base just two or three times
previously, but didn't hesitate to make the change.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good to be able to know how to play two positions,
because I knew that as long as Jeter is around, it would be tough
to stick with the Yankees,'' he said. ''I was in New York for a few
games last year and this year, and I'll do whatever they tell me so
I can stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher said Soriano appears to be making the switch smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's caught everything they've thrown at him so far, though he
did throw one ball away,'' he said. ''You don't want someone in
there thinking 'What do I have to do?' and Alfonso doesn't seem to
have that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillman seems to think the change is going fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm always concerned about the fear factor when an infielder
shifts positions and has to adjust to taking throws differently,
but Alfonso doesn't seem to have a fear factor,'' Hillman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most Dominican middle infielders want to play shortstop
because there have been so many good Dominicans at that position,
but Alfonso just wants to play, and I don't think the position
matters. There's a pride factor there, and a willingness to do
anything that's in the best service of the major league club.''

<HEADLINE> US Doctor Stabbed By Korean, Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A U.S. Army doctor who was stabbed by
a South Korean man on a busy Seoul street last weekend has died,
the U.S. military command said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Command spokeswoman Lee Ferguson confirmed that the doctor had
died, but said she had no other details and did not know exactly
when and where the death occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor, identified by South Korean police as Maj. Barry
David. He was admitted to a U.S. military hospital with stab wounds
suffered during a brawl with a South Korean man Saturday in
Itaewon, near the main U.S. military compound.
</P>
<P>
   The attacker, identified by South Korean police as Lee Yong-kyu,
36, was picking up two knives from a roadside garbage can when the
American officer passed by, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The jobless South Korean man told police that he was angry
because the American insulted him. Police said the attacker
confessed to stabbing the doctor in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   After questioning the attacker, police said he appeared to be
''mentally unstable.''
</P>
<P>
   Violent crimes are uncommon in South Korea, especially against
Americans. About 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in the country.

<HEADLINE> Indian Assembly Votes For Autonomy  </HEADLINE>
By QAISER MIRZA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- The Jammu-Kashmir state assembly voted
Monday to approve a plan to implement autonomy in India's only
Muslim majority state, setting up a showdown with the national
government.
</P>
<P>
   After five days of debate, the motion was passed by voice vote
to return the state to its pre-1953 status, when Jammu-Kashmir had
its own president and prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The motion, urging the national government to take ''positive
and effective steps for implementation,'' sets up a conflict
between the state government and its allies in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   The Bharatiya Janata Party of India's Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee opposed the autonomy measure in the state assembly, and
members of the party walked out before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Shiv Charan Gupta, a member of Vajpayee's party, said: ''We
don't want autonomy and nobody in the state wants autonomy. This
was a futile exercise. It is not going to pass in the center (New
Delhi).''
</P>
<P>
   However, Lal Krishna Advani, a top ruling party leader and
India's home minister, said the government will consider the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The autonomy plan was immediately rejected by Kashmiri militant
and political groups fighting for secession from India since 1989.
They are demanding more than just autonomy; they want complete
freedom from India.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, militant groups have been fighting to separate the
state from India, with some groups favoring its annexation to
Pakistan. The state has been the cause of two of the three wars
between Pakistan and India.

<HEADLINE> Blackthorne testifies he didn't kill ex-wife  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE KOIDIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) - South Texas millionaire Allen Blackthorne
testified Monday that he had nothing to do with the shooting and
stabbing of his ex-wife, although he admitted he once threatened to
kill her.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-year-old businessman, on trial in San Antonio, is accused
of arranging the 1997 murder of Sheila Bellush in her Sarasota,
Fla., home.
</P>
<P>
   When Blackthorne's attorney asked him about the killing, he
answered, ''Nothing. I had nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Blackthorne denied accusations that he asked a golfing
buddy, Daniel Rocha, during a golf trip to Oregon to find a hit man
to kill his ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''While in Oregon did you ask Rocha to kill Sheila?'' defense
attorney Richard Lubin asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''No,'' replied Blackthorne.
</P>
<P>
   ''Or to threaten or hurt her?''
</P>
<P>
   ''No.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellush was killed Nov. 7, 1997, shortly after moving with her
second husband, Jamie Bellush, and six children to Sarasota. Her
2-year-old quadruplets from her second marriage were discovered
unharmed in the house, two of them crawling in their mother's
blood. Jamie Bellush and the children now live in Sussex County,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Her ex-husband is charged with interstate conspiracy to commit
murder for hire and interstate domestic violence. Blackthorne faces
a mandatory life sentence if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bellush's sister testified that Blackthorne twice
threatened Bellush with death.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Bladorn of Turner, Oregon, testified about a 1985 ski trip
in which she said Blackthorne told his then-wife that if she left
him, he would take the children and kill her. Bladorn said another
threat came in Easter 1990, when she visited her sister in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   During daylong testimony Monday, Blackthorne denied making those
threats but told his lawyer that he once became upset after his
younger daughter fell out of a second-story window during a party.
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne said he felt like his wife was negligent. He said he
didn't remember his exact words but the message was, ''If anything
happens to my kids, I will kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident was shortly after the couple separated. They
divorced in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like I meant it when I said it,'' Blackthorne said. ''I
was angry. I was mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne also testified about the bitter nature of his
custody battles with Bellush.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't like her,'' he said. ''I hated what she did. She did
a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne said he decided to give up the custody fight in July
1997 because his older daughter and pregnant second wife weren't
getting along. He surrendered his parental rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was hard,'' he said, fighting back tears.
</P>
<P>
   But on cross-examination, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Murphy
got Blackthorne to admit that he repeatedly has lied. Blackthorne
did not dispute that he changed his name to hide from a debtor,
that he hid assets during his divorce proceedings and that while he
fought to get his child support payments reduced from $1,250 a
month, he regularly lost that amount gambling on a round of golf.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that while his gambling losses to Rocha in 1997
totaled between $75,000 and $200,000, he has not sent his daughters
any money since their mother was killed. He said his lawyer advised
him not to until after the trial is over.
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne explained phone calls to Rocha made from out of town
in the weeks leading up to the slaying by saying he was placing
bets on football games with Rocha, who also was his bookie.
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne said after the Bellushes moved to Florida, he
contacted a private investigator and a bail bondsman to try to get
his ex-wife arrested on abuse charges and sent back to Texas. But
the charges against her were dropped after a police investigation,
and Blackthorne admitted Monday he exaggerated the condition of one
of his daughters. He also admitted seeking his ex-wife's new
address from the investigator and bondsman.
</P>
<P>
   Rocha testified earlier in the trial that he contacted a friend,
Sammy Gonzales, who hired his cousin, Jose Luis Del Toro, the
alleged gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gonzales and Rocha are serving prison terms in Florida for
solicitation of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Del Toro, 23, a former high school football star in Uvalde, is
scheduled for trial next month in Florida.

<HEADLINE> Former Oilers Coach Hughes Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIBERTYVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- Ed Hughes, former coach of the Houston
Oilers and offensive coordinator of the 1986 Super Bowl champion
Chicago Bears, died last week. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes died Friday at Condell Medical Center in Libertyville,
Ill., of heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes was Houston's coach in 1971, and went 4-9-1 with the
Oilers. He then worked as the offensive coordinator for the Dallas
Cowboys from 1973-76.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, along with Mike Ditka, the Cowboys' special teams coach,
helped lead the team to three postseason appearances -- including
the 1976 Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka left the Cowboys for the Bears after that season, and
became head coach in 1982. During the NFL players strike that
season, Ditka decided he was spending too much time calling
offensive plays and not enough time coaching the defense and the
kicking game.
</P>
<P>
   So he turned to Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was thrilled to pieces to come to Chicago, and since my
family was from Chicago, it was even better,'' said his wife,
Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes coached an offensive squad that included Walter Payton
and Jim McMahon. In 1985, the team rolled through the regular
season, losing only one game. The Bears then swept through the
playoffs, finishing with a 46-10 victory over the New England
Patriots in the 1986 Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after that victory, Hughes retired.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes spent decades in professional football. After he
graduated from Tulsa in 1952, Hughes was drafted by and played with
the Los Angeles Rams as a cornerback and also played with the New
York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing his playing career in 1958, Hughes returned to
his alma mater to coach. From there, Hughes returned to
professional football as a coach, starting when he took a job as an
assistant with the Dallas Texans, who later became the Kansas City
Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   His career as an assistant included stints with the Washington
Redskins, Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers before he
became coach of the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Hughes is survived by his son, James;
daughters Madeline, Maureen, Colleen Kelliher and Eileen Horgan;
two brothers, Jim and Dick; and seven grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services were to be held Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Commssioner Hearing Opens  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HOWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A state lawyer said Monday she went
public in the scandal surrounding Insurance Commissioner Chuck
Quackenbush because she was outraged by the agency's lenient
treatment of insurers after the 1994 Los Angeles earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   In opening testimony at a legislative hearing, Insurance
Department attorney Cindy Ossias said the settlements the
department reached with insurers accused of mishandling claims
after quake were far lower than her investigation found were
warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was appalled,'' Ossias told the Assembly Insurance
Committee. ''I had been involved in three of the examinations. ...
I felt these exams showed violations that were egregious and
warranted hefty fines.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the panel ordered the arrest of a witness who
failed to appear. And two key witnesses who did appear -- Deputy
Commissioner Mark Lowder and former Deputy Commissioner George
Grays -- invoked their Fifth Amendment protection against
self-incrimination and declined to answer questions about
California's biggest political scandal in years.
</P>
<P>
   Ossias, who released confidential audits to legislators
investigating Quackenbush, said the settlements were for far less
than the department could have obtained.
</P>
<P>
   She detailed $119 million in alleged claims violations against
State Farm and said she was ordered to shred her report on the
insurer, which later settled by giving $2 million to a fund created
by Quackenbush.
</P>
<P>
   Ossias said her $119 million figure was an ''opening gambit''
for negotiations, reflecting ''the absolute maximum exposure of the
company to the Department of Insurance,'' and that a final
settlement might be lower.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't seem out of line for State Farm to have paid $20
million or $40 million,'' she said. But the $2 million payment, she
testified, was inadequate to resolve hundreds of alleged violations
outlined in department audits.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican former state assemblyman, Quackenbush was elected
to the insurance commissioner post in 1994, pledging to crack down
on insurance fraud and other crimes and make insurance more
affordable. He won re-election in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But in just weeks, the 46-year-old former Army helicopter pilot
has become enmeshed in controversy. He is accused of leveraging
millions of dollars in settlement funds from the insurers he
regulates -- and who donated to his campaign -- to further his own
political prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner himself is scheduled to testify Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush has denied knowledge of any improper activities and
contends he is target of a Democratic vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   But Assembly Minority Leader Scott Baugh, a Republican, said
earlier hearings ''unearthed a truckload of disturbing evidence,
and it is quite apparent that Insurance Department personnel were
engaged in inappropriate activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The insurance committee is expected to decide after
Quackenbush's testimony whether he committed wrongdoing, and if so,
what action it should recommend. The possibilities include censure,
criminal charges or impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Ossias testified Monday that her anger led her to release
confidential department audits to the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''With each settlement amount I saw I was more outraged,''
Ossias said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600,000 claims were filed following the quake, which
killed 72 people and caused more than $15 billion in insured
losses. It rivals Hurricane Andrew as the nation's costliest
national disaster.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the scandal is Quackenbush's creation of a
series of nonprofit foundations with money from insurance company
settlements. By one estimate, he authorized more than two dozen
settlements totaling $19 million, enabling companies to pay a
fraction of the amount they could have been fined.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush created the largest foundation, the California
Research and Assistance Fund, in April 1999 with donations from a
half-dozen insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Audits by Quackenbush's staff detailed hundreds of allegations
of mishandled earthquake claims and suggested potential fines of up
to $3.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush allowed the insurers to resolve the complaints by
contributing just $12 million to the fund, designed to provide
money for consumer assistance and quake research.
</P>
<P>
   But even Quackenbush acknowledges none of the money had been
spent for either purpose. More than $4.1 million financed
public-service television advertising featuring the commissioner,
and hundreds of thousands of dollars went to groups with no
connection to quake issues.
</P>
<P>
   The committee issued an arrest warrant for B.T. Thompson of the
Skillz Athletic Foundation, which received $217,000 in foundation
funds and ran a sports camp attended by Quackenbush's children.
Thompson failed to appear under subpoena, and the committee ordered
the sergeant-at-arms to arrest him and compel him to testify,
possibly at the Thursday hearing.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Man Sentenced For Beating Dog  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCALA, Fla. (AP) -- A man convicted of beating a dog because he
thought it was homosexual was sentenced to six months in jail and
ordered to take an anger management course.
</P>
<P>
   George Stephens Finley, 58, hit the animal with a hard plastic
vacuum cleaner wand in the head and threw it against a tree last
July. The dog lapsed into a coma and two hours later was euthanized
by a veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses testified that Finley was upset the neutered male dog,
a poodle-Yorkshire terrier mix, repeatedly tried to engage in
sexual activity with another family dog, a male Jack Russell
terrier.
</P>
<P>
   Finley was convicted of felony animal cruelty two weeks ago. His
sentence Thursday included a $500 fine and 1,000 hours of community
service.
</P>
<P>
   Finley apologized before he was sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm truly sorry for all of this,'' Finley said. ''It's a
stupid thing I did.'' His attorney didn't deny that Finley struck
the dog but said he did so accidentally.
</P>
<P>
   Finley and his wife Sybil had been given the dog as a Mother's
Day present from their children 10 years ago. They divorced after
the incident.

<HEADLINE> Gore Meeting With Saddam Foes  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore told Iraqi opposition
leaders Monday that Saddam Hussein stands in the way of Middle East
peace and ''must be removed from power.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that there can be no peace for the Iraqi people and
a genuine peace for the people of the Middle East so long as Saddam
is in a position to brutalize his people and threaten his
neighbors,'' Gore told representatives of forces trying to topple
the Iraqi president.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential candidate was showcasing his foreign
policy responsibilities as vice president Monday -- experience his
campaign says makes him better prepared to be president than his
Republican opponent, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after meeting with the Iraqis, Gore shifted gears
for talks and an official dinner with Armenian President Robert
Kocharyan, whom Gore saluted for showing ''true statesmanship in
reaching out to the people of Azerbaijan.'' The two nations have a
lingering dispute over independence claims by Nagorno-Karabakh,
which is controlled by Armenia but is located within Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad Chalabi, leader of the Iraqi National Congress, was among
the nine Iraqi opposition figures seated with Gore around a
circular conference table at the State Department. Other groups
represented at the session, which was open to reporters only for a
quick photo and Gore's introductory remarks, included the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan, the Kurdish Democratic Party and the
Constitutional Monarchist Movement.
</P>
<P>
   The United States ''will not flag in supporting your efforts,''
Gore said, and will continue to enforce the ''no-fly zones'' over
southern and northern Iraq that Americans and their allies have
patrolled to prevent Saddam from threatening citizens --
particularly the Kurds -- in these regions.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the interests of regional peace and for the sake of human
decency, (Saddam) must be removed from power. That is the policy of
this administration. It is the policy I support. It is the policy I
am personally committed to,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior State Department official said after the half-hour
meeting that, because it was not a campaign event, Gore did not
speak ''in terms of a Gore presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting made good on Gore's promise to American Jewish
activists on May 23 that he would encourage Iraqi opposition
leaders to unite in their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Chalabi's group received $265,000 in economic support
funds, marking the United States' first direct grant to aid
Saddam's overthrow. Congress appropriated $8 million late last year
for this purpose, plus $97 million in surplus Pentagon equipment
provided under the Iraqi Liberation Act signed by President
Clinton. The United States also has accepted 145 Iraqis for
non-military training, including field medicine, transport and
communications, under the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam and U.S. concerns that he will build weapons of mass
destruction are a leftover problem from George Bush's presidency
and the Persian Gulf War. Gore is constrained from making Iraq much
of an issue in the presidential campaign against Bush's son because
the Clinton-Gore administration has little to show for its own
efforts against Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   The administration launched punishing air raids on Baghdad in
December 1998 but failed to force Saddam to cooperate with United
Nations weapons inspectors, who have yet to return to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the inspectors back in was not discussed Monday because
it fell ''outside the scope of this discussion,'' the State
Department official said on condition that he not be identified. As
to whether Saddam's ouster was any closer to realization now than
last year, this official said: ''We're certainly a year closer. No
one has a deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. sanctions imposed for Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait aren't
to be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify Iraq no longer has or
can produce weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the Gore campaign said it hired Nashville, Tenn.,
businesswoman Cindy Wall to direct outreach to women voters. Polls
have shown Gore having trouble among women, who came out for the
1996 Clinton-Gore ticket in decisive numbers. Last week, Gore's
vice presidential office brought on Alvin Brown to help with
outreach to black voters.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Opposition Makes Gains  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Zimbabwe's main opposition party was
making historic gains in the country's most hotly contested
parliamentary election since independence 20 years ago, according
to results released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With results in 100 of 120 parliamentary districts announced,
the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change had won 48 seats
and the ruling party 51, officials said Monday. A small independent
party won one seat.
</P>
<P>
   Such a closely contested race is unprecedented in a country
where President Robert Mugabe's party has ruled virtually
unchallenged since 1980. The opposition held only three seats in
the previous parliament.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Movement for Democratic Change, or MDC, appeared to
have fallen short in its bid to win a majority in the parliament.
It needed 76 of the 120 elected seats to seize power in the
150-member body. Mugabe, who has two years left on his term,
appoints the remaining 30 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary election came after months of campaign-related
violence and unrest over the takeovers of hundreds of white-owned
farms by armed black squatters. Opposition members said the
takeovers were sanctioned by Mugabe's government. Some accused the
government of encouraging the takeovers to build its support among
landless blacks before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   After early results were announced on national television, some
MDC supporters drove through the streets of Harare honking their
horns. They gave the open hand salute of the party and shouted the
MDC slogan: ''Change!''
</P>
<P>
   But MDC officials also said the results showed that government
intimidation worked in some rural areas. David Coltart, the MDC
legal adviser and a successful candidate, said the opposition plans
to challenge some of the results in court.
</P>
<P>
   ''In many of these constituencies, they have only won through
intimidation,'' Coltart said.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition performed well in urban areas, as expected, but
also won seats in Mugabe's rural strongholds in the weekend
election.
</P>
<P>
   Several high-level ruling party officials and Cabinet ministers
lost their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa was crushed nearly 2-to-1 in
his rural district by an opponent who had fled the district and
gone into hiding after being attacked by ruling party militants.
Mnangagwa has been considered a possible successor to Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa received less than 4,000
of the more than 24,000 votes cast in his district in the
southwestern city of Bulawayo.
</P>
<P>
   MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai also lost in his bid for a seat.
</P>
<P>
   With Zimbabwe's economy in shambles, the opposition party was
posing the strongest challenge to Mugabe's party since it led the
country to independence from white-minority rule 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The large turnout, estimated in excess of 3 million of the
nation's 5.1 million registered voters, overwhelmed counting
stations, leading to delays in confirming results.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout ''was just too large ... more than twice as much as
ever before,'' said Tobaiwa Mudede, the state Registrar General.
</P>
<P>
   As both sides waited for more results to come in, international
observers from the European Union said the campaign was badly
tainted by violence and could not be considered free and fair. At
least 30 people were killed ahead of the vote, and thousands were
beaten and threatened, mainly by ruling party militants.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in Mugabe's party ''seemed to sanction the use of
violence and intimidation against political opponents and
contributed significantly to the climate of fear so evident during
the election campaign,'' the EU said.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition supporters also waged attacks, but they were far
fewer and their leaders were clear in their condemnation of the
violence, observers said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police were being deployed throughout the country to
prevent any possible outbreaks of trouble between the rival
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Riot police were sent to the southwestern Harare suburb of
Budiriro, scene of repeated clashes in previous weeks between
ruling party militants and opposition supporters. There were no
reports of any clashes, and police appealed for calm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who win must be graceful and not target losers. Those
who lose must accept losing with honor,'' Police Commissioner
Augustine Chihuri said in a nationwide broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   In the months leading up to the election, armed ruling party
militants occupied hundreds of white-owned farms, demanding they be
divided up and given to landless blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition candidate Roy Bennett, a white farmer who temporarily
had to flee his property after it was overrun by ruling party
militants, won a strong victory in his Chimanimani district near
the Mozambican border.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Infected Man Didn't Use Gloves  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREDERICK, Md. (AP) -- An Army scientist who contracted a rare
equine disease considered a potential biological weapon
occasionally handled lab equipment containing live bacteria without
using gloves, a report says.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
does not explain how the microbiologist contracted glanders, a
potentially fatal disease. But it says the nature of his symptoms
suggests he was exposed through his skin rather than by ingesting
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC recommends gloves for workers in biosafety level 3
laboratories, the type of lab in which the unidentified scientist
worked at Fort Detrick. Researchers there develop defenses against
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Army is conducting a separate review of safety procedures at
the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The microbiologist recovered from glanders, the first reported
human case of the disease since 1945. No one who worked or lived
with him was afflicted, according to the CDC report, which was
released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist fell ill in mid-March and continued working,
despite worsening symptoms, for about six weeks while private
doctors tried in vain to cure him with standard antibiotics. He
eventually was hospitalized and properly diagnosed with help from
Army experts.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Deports 60 Haitian Convicts  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- The United States returned 60
Haitian convicts to their homeland Monday despite fears that such
deportations are contributing to crime in the Caribbean country.
</P>
<P>
   The deportees were handcuffed and taken to Port-au-Prince's main
penitentiary after disembarking from a charter aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Camille Leblanc said about eight minor
offenders, including three illegal immigrants, would be released.
The others were to be detained until police could identify them and
locate family members.
</P>
<P>
   Many Haitians blame the deportations for increasing crime.
Earlier this year, the Haitian government refused to accept more
deportees until it could better prepare for them.
</P>
<P>
   From January 1998 to October 1999, more than 400 convicts were
deported to Haiti, most from the United States. Some had been
convicted of minor offenses, such as traffic violations, but others
had served terms for crimes ranging from drug dealing to murder.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, nearly 3,000 have been deported from Canada and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The cash-strapped Haitian government has been unable to follow
up individual cases. Many deportees, arriving in handcuffs at the
airport outside the capital, have been released and left to fend
for themselves. Authorities complain that many of the deportees
left Haiti when they were children and have no close relatives in
the country to help them.
</P>
<P>
   Leblanc said about 420 more will be deported in coming months.
They will return in groups of 60.
</P>
<P>
   Other Caribbean countries have also complained about the
deportations of convicts. Earlier this month, Attorney General
Janet Reno signed an agreement with Trinidad and Tobago pledging to
give that country more warning and better documentation on
deportees. In return, Trinidad promised to issue travel papers more
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she was seeking similar agreements with other
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Tina Thompson scored 19 points and the
Houston Comets used a 17-4 run in the second half to pull away to a
70-58 victory over the Orlando Miracle on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   A basket by Orlando's Shannon Johnson cut Houston's lead to
50-46, but the Comets then began their decisive run and led 67-50
with 2:37 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Swoopes had 14 points and nine rebounds and Cynthia
Cooper added 13 points and six assists for Houston (12-2), which
shot 46.7 percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Nykesha Sales and Taj McWilliams each had 14 points and were a
combined 12-for-29 from the field for the Miracle (7-6), who shot
39.4 percent, including going 0-for-9 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson finished with 10 points and a game-high 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Houston led 31-22 at halftime, but Orlando started the second
half with a 14-6 run to make it a one-point game with 15:47 to
play. Houston built its lead to as many as 10 points before Orlando
cut it to four on Johnson's running jumper at the 9:09 mark. It was
the last time the Miracle would make a serious challenge as they
trailed by at least 10 points over the final 5:30.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 13, Indians 2  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Juan Gonzalez decided that New York was just a
nice place to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez rejected a one-year contract extension, collapsing a
proposed 3-for-1 trade to the Yankees on Monday and then helped
lead the Detroit Tigers to a 13-2 victory over the Cleveland
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time MVP went 3-for-4 with an RBI triple, scored twice
and walked as the Tigers went 7-6 against the Indians this year,
winning the season series for the first time since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of playing for the Yankees, Gonzalez will now face them
Tuesday night at home.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Moehler (5-4) pitched 6 2-3 innings for his fourth win in
six decisions. The right-hander gave up seven hits, walked three
and struck out three.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Clark went 3-for-5 with a homer and three RBIs and Juan
Encarnacion had four hits, including a two-run double in Detroit's
four-run sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Higginson threw out two runners for the Tigers. He leads
the AL with eight outfield assists.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Burba (8-3) might have pitched himself off the All-Star
team with another shaky outing. He gave up six runs and eight hits
in 5 1-3 innings, raising his ERA to 8.49 in his last four starts.
</P>
<P>
   In dropping three of five to the last-place Tigers, the Indians
fell 8&AMP;frac12; games behind first-place Chicago in the AL Central.
Cleveland is 13-17 in a division it has dominated since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a week of rumors, guessing games and dead ends, the
Gonzalez-to-the-Yankees soap opera is finally finished.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it wore on him personally,'' Tigers manager Phil
Garner said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez wouldn't comment when the deadline passed before the
game, choosing perhaps to make his statement on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Ausmus gave the Tigers a 1-0 lead in the first with his
fifth homer of the season, a wind-blown shot over the wall in right
off Burba.
</P>
<P>
   After Bobby Higginson walked, Gonzalez, who sat out Sunday's
game with a sore left ankle, looked fine as he legged out a
run-scoring triple. Clark followed with a grounder to short that
scored Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit went up 4-0 in the second when Encarnacion doubled,
Deivi Cruz sacrificed and Shane Halter hit an RBI groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Sexson and Travis Fryman drove in Cleveland's runs.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The teams combined to use 92 pitchers in 13 games this
year, an average of seven per game. ... When Al Newman relieved in
the eighth, the Indians tied a club record by using 26 pitchers in
one season. Cleveland also used 26 pitchers in 1993 when it went
76-86. ... The Tigers are still only 10-34 at Jacobs Field and
24-59 against Cleveland in the last seven years. ... Indians SS
Omar Vizquel sat out with a bruised right knee he suffered fouling
a ball off it Sunday. Vizquel has not committed an error in 74
games. ... Indians 3B Travis Fryman has a 58-game errorless streak,
the longest by a third baseman since John Valentin went 65 games
without an error in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Bush: Split INS Into Two Agencies  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush told Hispanic leaders on Monday
he wants to split the Immigration and Naturalization Service into
two parts: a welcoming one for legitimate immigrants and a tough
one for border enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also called for allowing relatives of permanent residents
to visit the United States while their own immigration papers are
being processed.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential contender addressed the League of
United Latin American Citizens, spicing his speech with Spanish
phrases.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to change few minds. Those who said they already liked
Bush said they liked his message. Those opposed to him heard
nothing inviting in his 20-minute talk.
</P>
<P>
   Rene Garcia, a government worker from Philadelphia and a
Republican, liked everything he heard from the Texas governor on
education, immigration reform and family.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like the way he thinks,'' Garcia said. ''I like his message
because he thinks education is important and he respects Hispanic
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Teri Martinez, a teacher from Tucson, Ariz., and a Democrat,
said, ''It's like he's talking off the top of his head. All I hear
is rhetoric. Everything he says is extremely ambiguous. I think he
should have been briefed better because everything was too
general.''
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Avila, a bookkeeper from Florida and Republican, said he
made up his mind long ago that Bush was getting his vote. But
hearing him speak gave Avila a chance to shake hands and get a
photo taken with his candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I liked his father and I like him too,'' Avila said.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking off a week aimed at showing he's ''a different kind of
Republican,'' Bush called the INS ''an agency that sends mixed
signals to the people we're trying to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides splitting the INS in two, he said that as president he
would drop the policy that bars the spouses and minor children of
legal permanent residents from coming into the country while their
own entry applications are being processed.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I've said, family values should not stop at the Rio Grande
River,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bush's likely rival, Vice President Al Gore,
said that while INS might be in need of some reform, the agency
shouldn't be split.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't need to create another bureaucracy. We can strike the
right balance between law enforcement and customer service under a
streamlined INS,'' said Doug Hattaway.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that Gore supports allowing the visits by relatives
of permanent residents ''because uniting families is central to his
immigration policy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He would also work with Congress to ensure that the INS has
adequate resources to reduce the backlog'' of applications for
legal permanent residence,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush voiced strong support for trade with Mexico and added ''A
strong Mexico is good for America. I want prosperity to extend its
reaches.''
</P>
<P>
   On education, Bush said he would hold local school districts
responsible if children didn't learn.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no second-rate children in America and no
second-rate dreams,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrat David Villa Hernandez, a postal worker from
Phoenix, the message was acceptable. But he went into the speech a
Gore man and said he remained one after Bush's talk.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Bush's political allies in the Republican Party,
Hernandez said, ''I really don't mind George Bush that much but I
don't like the company he keeps. They never have paid much
attention to Latino issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday, Bush reiterated his stance on education in a
speech at a benefit diner for the Congress of Racial Equality,
which is led by conservative black activist Roy Innis. He also
discussed tax cuts, saying the tax code penalizes people at the
lower end of the income scale.
</P>

   ''It's as if we put a toll booth right in the middle of the road
to the middle class. On the one side, people are kind of moving
along and looking at the stock market, and on the other side, we've
raised the toll. That's not right,'' Bush said.

<HEADLINE> Casino executives receive pay raises  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) - Casino executives' salaries continue to rise,
but so does the value of their companies' stock.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's best chief executive salary and bonus
compensation package jumped 31.6 percent in 1999 when Park Place
Entertainment's Arthur Goldberg earned $5 million. The previous
record holder was Mirage Resorts' Steve Wynn with $3.8 million in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of gaming stock did even better. The Chicago Board
Options Exchange index of key gaming stocks was up 49.8 percent, to
252.45 from 168.47.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executives' pay is partly determined by the size of the
executive's company, measured by revenue and the company's
profitability, said Mae Lon Ding, president of Anaheim Hills,
Calif.-based Personnel Systems Associates and an executive
compensation expert.
</P>
<P>
   By those measures, MGM Grand Chairman Terry Lanni, whose company
was the most profitable and the fourth-largest in 1999, was
underpaid. His salary and bonus totaled $1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lanni's new subordinate, Bobby Baldwin, earned $2.4 million as
Steve Wynn's right-hand man. Baldwin, who was chief financial
officer and treasurer of Mirage Resorts, will serve as chief
executive of MGM Grand's Mirage subsidiary and will report directly
to Lanni.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin also earned more than the chief executives of three
other major casino companies: Phil Satre of Harrah's Entertainment,
$2 million; William Boyd of Boyd Gaming Corp., $1.8 million; and
Mike Ensign of Mandalay Resort Group, $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gaming executives have produced profit and shareholder value and
have earned their salaries and bonuses, said Bill Thompson of the
University of Nevada, Las Vegas' Department of Public
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their rewards are not out of line,'' he said. ''Sports stars
earn far more than gaming executives make, yet they work a lot
harder than the athletes do.''
</P>
<P>
   Those salaries also are boosted by lucrative stock options that
might persuade top executives to accept lower salaries in return
for the potential of long-term wealth through stock.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons with star athletes aren't superficial, said Ding,
who thinks the star culture is part of the American social fabric.
</P>
<P>
   ''The top executives tend to be the stars - and the CEO is the
key player in the company's game. If the business plan doesn't
work, other individuals' contributions won't matter,'' she
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone buys into the idea that corporate executives should
be paid like athletes or movie stars.
</P>
<P>
   ''I personally feel like $2 million is adequate for any
executive,'' said Evelyn Davis, editor of Highlights and Low
Lights, a newsletter for corporate leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Executive salaries are driven by ego. If one of them gets a
big salary increase, everyone else wants one too,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Only four executives earned 1999 salaries and bonuses of more
than $2 million, but eight earned at least $1.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Arizona's Stottlemyre Back on DL  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks placed right-hander Todd
Stottlemyre on the 15-day disabled list for the second time this
season Monday and brought up minor league sensation Alex Cabrera to
fill the roster spot.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre has tendinitis in his right elbow, the same ailment
that sidelined him from May 30 to June 14. An MRI exam Monday
showed no tear in the ligament. Had a tear been detected,
Stottlemyre's season, and perhaps his career, would have been over.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is for Stottlemyre, the No. 2 starter in the rotation,
to return July 17.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the fifth day after the All-Star break,'' manager Buck
Showalter said, ''so he gets the benefit of three weeks. That's
what we're shooting for at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a little more time than Stottlemyre took off to rest the
injured elbow the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think last time I pitched on the 16th day after I was
sidelined,'' Stottlemyre said. ''Maybe an extra four, five or six
days will be a big difference. Maybe more rest mean's I'll last
longer next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sottlemyre, 8-5 with a 4.24 ERA, said he had perhaps his best
stuff ever in his previous start, when he struck out 10 in a 3-1
loss to San Diego. But on Sunday against Colorado, he lasted one
inning before telling Showalter that the pain was too great.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera was having one of the best minor-league seasons anyone
has had. At Double-A El Paso, the right-handed hitting first
baseman was batting .382 with 35 home runs and 82 RBIs in just 53
games. His 21 home runs in May were the second-most ever in one
month by a minor leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those numbers dwarf about anything I've seen,'' Showalter
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Venezuela-born Cabrera, 28, has played professional baseball
for seven seasons, and was in Taiwan in 1999. He said he didn't
believe it at first when he was told Sunday night that he was going
to the big time.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has just been an incredible year for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He missed all of spring training with a bulging disk but had
targeted the majors all along this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had told myself, if I don't make it to the big-leagues this
year, I'll quit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera is Arizona's fourth first baseman. The others are
Erubiel Durazo, Greg Colbrunn and Travis Lee. Lee usually plays in
right field, Colbrunn has been platooned with the left-handed
Durazo, who tore cartilage in his right wrist and came off the DL
last Friday. Durazo aggravated the injury Sunday but said he felt
fine on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, 35, admits that he gave retirement some thought.
He's already pitching with two partial tears in his rotator cuff.
When he was injured last season, he decided against surgery because
it would cause him to miss all of this season.
</P>
<P>
   He knows his days as a pitcher are numbered, and he felt
obligated to pitch for the Diamondbacks as they shoot for the World
Series this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd be lying if I said I hadn't thought 'Is it time to walk
away? Am I being fair?' all those things that can cloud your mind
at times of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess it's this owner, this coaching staff, this manager,
the 25 guys who put the uniform on every day. I want to be here. I
want to be on this club when they put the world championship ring
on Jerry Colangelo.''

<HEADLINE> Man unintentional victim of Allegany County dispute  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRDSALL, N.Y. (AP) - A man shot dead in a car Saturday was the
unintentional victim of feuding campers trading gunfire across a
country road, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Agnes Burk and Joseph Dengel, both 37 and from West Henrietta,
and Andrew Ford, 34, of Buffalo, were in Allegany County Jail
Monday without bail. Burk and Dengel were charged with
second-degree murder; Ford with second-degree attempt of murder.
All three were described as seasonal residents of Birdsall, a town
56 miles southwest of Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   State police said 39-year-old John R. Gniewkowski of the town of
Ontario was spotlighting deer with his fiance and her 8-year-old
daughter when Gniewkowski was killed instantly by a bullet wound to
the head.
</P>
<P>
   According to troopers, Gniewkowski was not the target of the
shooting. Instead, they said, Gniewkowski was caught in the cross
fire of an apparent neighborhood dispute. Police said all three
defendants had been drinking alcohol. The weapons used were a
.22-caliber rifle, a .410-caliber shotgun, and a .35-caliber rifle.

<HEADLINE> Rolling Stones Label Loses Fight  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT ANDREWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Rolling Stones' former record label
lost a battle Monday in the war over who owns the rights to a pair
of songs first recorded by the late blues legend Robert Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling on a narrow issue, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
eliminated one justification that ABKCO Music Inc. cited when it
claimed the rock band did not violate copyright law by recording
''Love In Vain'' and ''Stop Breakin' Down'' in the late 1960s and
early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the band believed that any common-law copyrights on
the song had expired, said ABKCO attorney Donald S. Zakarin. The
Johnson recordings had been issued decades earlier and had never
been formally copyrighted.
</P>
<P>
   But the court ruled that a law passed by Congress in 1997
eliminated those facts as reasons ABKCO can cite as it fights
claims by the current copyright holder. The 9th Circuit Court sent
the case back to the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles for further
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Kornarens, the attorney for the current copyright
holder, Stephen LaVere of Glendale, Calif., said from Los Angeles
that the ruling makes it a foregone conclusion that the lower court
will rule that the Rolling Stones had no right to use the
compositions without paying the copyright holder.
</P>
<P>
   But Zakarin said Kornarens was getting ahead of himself and
would face new arguments to dispute LaVere's claim to the music.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was the mythic bluesman who, according to legend, traded
his soul to the devil in return for a haunting talent on the
guitar. He died in 1938, allegedly from drinking poisoned whiskey.
His music was reissued in 1961 and 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The Stones put ''Love In Vain'' on their 1969 album ''Let It
Bleed'' and redid ''Stop Breakin' Down'' in 1972.

<HEADLINE> Columbus Unveils Discrimination Plan  </HEADLINE>
By LIZ SIDOTI
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Mayor Michael Coleman unveiled a plan to
prevent discrimination by police officers just two days before a
possible U.S. Department of Justice decision to add racial
profiling to its lawsuit against the city police force.
</P>
<P>
   ''Racial profiling is not taught and is not trained here. We
must send a clear message that Columbus will not tolerate it,''
Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman denied that the plan was timed to persuade the Justice
Department not to add the complaint to its federal lawsuit two days
before a court-imposed deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus is the first city in the nation to challenge a Justice
Department lawsuit that alleges a pattern of civil rights
violations by a police department.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed Oct. 21 against the city and the police
department, accuses police officers of abusing civil rights by
filing false charges, using excessive force and conducting illegal
searches and seizures.
</P>
<P>
   Kara Peterman, a Justice Department spokeswoman, would not
comment on whether the Justice Department knew about the
improvement plan or whether it will add the complaint to its
lawsuit before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman and police Chief James Jackson have discussed the plan,
police spokesman Sgt. Earl Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus police do not instruct or conduct racial profiling,
Jackson said in a written statement. The police department will
work to make sure that police and citizens know that the department
encourages and requires ''fair treatment of all
citizens...period,'' Jackson said.

<HEADLINE> Air Canada pilots Authorize Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Pilots for Air Canada have authorized their
union to call a strike as soon as this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The union announced Monday that 95 percent of the pilots who
voted over the previous 10 days favored a strike. Union chairman
Raymond Hall said 92 percent of the 2,200 Air Canada pilots took
part in the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations were scheduled to resume Wednesday with Air Canada,
the nation's dominant carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said a decision on a strike would be made after Wednesday's
meeting. The union must give the airline 72 hours' notice of a
strike, making Saturday the earliest start of a work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots also could take alternative protest measures, Hall said,
including a strict following of rules and regulations that would
disrupt service.
</P>
<P>
   A strike would be the second by Air Canada pilots in 18 months.
The 1998 strike shut down the airline for almost two weeks at a
cost of more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Air Canada has offered a 14.5 percent pay increase over five
years and other benefits that would cost the airline more than $150
million, said Air Canada executive Calin Rovinescu. The average Air
Canada pilot earns about $60,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots say they want to be paid like pilots at U.S.
airlines, many of whom make more. They also seek assurances they
won't lose their jobs to lesser-paid pilots at Air Canada's
regional subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials said the federal government should intervene
to alleviate the problems a strike at the nation's biggest carrier
would cause.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an essential service, especially in the summertime
when people are vacationing, and we feel the government needs to
step in immediately if there is a strike,'' said Randy Williams of
the Association of Canadian Travel Agents.
</P>
<P>
   There was no comment Monday from the federal labor ministry.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- Zhang Ouying scored two goals as China beat
Canada 3-2 Monday night in the second game of a Women's Gold Cup
2000 doubleheader at Hersheypark Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico beat Guatemala 7-0 in the opening game.
</P>
<P>
   China (2-0) scored twice in the first nine minutes. Pan Lina
converted a nice through ball from Pu Wei in the sixth minute.
Zhang made it 2-0 three minutes later, finishing a breakaway by
sliding a shot past Canada goalkeeper Karina LeBlanc. Pu started
that play with a header.
</P>
<P>
   Canada (1-1) scored in the 31st minute when Charmaine Hooper
slipped the first of her two goals past China's Han Wenxia.
</P>
<P>
   China's lead was restored to two goals moments later, however,
when Zhang, off a nice one-touch pass from Pan, beat LeBlanc from
about eight yards out.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper capped the scoring on a penalty kick in the 50th minute.
</P>
<P>
   China, which claimed a berth in Saturday's semifinals with its
victory over Canada, will wrap up preliminary round play Wednesday
night in Louisville, Ky., against Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Canada will play Guatemala in the other game of that
doubleheader and a win would advance it into the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Brazil are both unbeaten in two games and
have clinched semifinal berths from the other group.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil and the United States play Tuesday in Foxboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The semifinals are Saturday in Louisville and the championship
game is July 3 in Foxboro.
</P>
<P>
   In the first game of Monday's doubleheader, Iris Mora scored
four goals and Maribel Dominguez added three for Mexico (1-1).
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez scored the only first-half goal for Mexico, connecting
off the dribble in the 10th minute after Gina Oceguera's cross from
the left flank.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, which kept alive its hopes for a berth in the
semifinals, struck quickly following halftime as Mora's first goal
came in the 47th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Mora and Dominguez alternated goals from the 67th minute on as
Mexico continually shredded the defense of Guatemala (0-2).

<HEADLINE> Australia Police Search For Drifter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHILDERS, Australia (AP) -- Police intensified their search
Tuesday for a drifter wanted for questioning in a fire that killed
15 young travelers after he was spotted close to the scene of the
blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Superintendent Ken Benjamin said someone had seen
37-year-old Robert Paul Long, an itinerant fruit picker, early
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have search teams in the area, and I'm saying we have had a
positive sighting from one person and I'm still hoping that more
information from the whole community will come forward,'' Benjamin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police have not formally described Long as a suspect in Friday's
blaze at the Palace Hostel, a backpackers' way station in this town
195 miles north of the state capital, Brisbane. But they have
launched an arson investigation and said they want to question
Long.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they expected to remove the final two bodies from
the burned-out shell of the hostel later Tuesday. The removal of
the bodies has been hampered by fears that the remains of the
building may collapse and by a painstaking search for forensic
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The fire killed six backpackers from Britain, four from
Australia, two from the Netherlands and one each from Ireland,
South Korea and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Won't Embark on Arms Race  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan's leader said Monday that
his nation will not give up its policy of nuclear deterrence but
also will not embark on a costly nuclear arms race with its hostile
neighbor, India.
</P>
<P>
   ''We only want to maintain a minimum credible deterrence to
deter any aggression against our homeland,'' the state-run news
agency quoted Gen. Pervez Musharraf as saying. ''We will not enter
into a nuclear arms race with India and never will we subject our
people to economic deprivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan and India exploded underground nuclear devices in 1998
and declared themselves nuclear powers. Since then, the
international community has tried to get the two countries to
renounce nuclear weapons. Both have refused.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known how many weapons either country possesses or
whether either country has taken a step to deploy nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between the two countries have broken down, and India has
refused Pakistan's offer to restart negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Since independence of the subcontinent in 1947, the two
neighbors have haggled over Kashmir, a disputed territory divided
between the two countries and claimed in its entirety by both.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947, two of
them over Kashmir. The introduction of nuclear weapons into their
respective arsenals has the international community worried that
another confrontation could result in the use of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf previously said Pakistan won't be the one to launch a
first strike.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has pressed both countries to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Neither country has rejected or
signed it, but both have declared a moratorium on further testing.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Protesters Picket Pfizer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- About 100 picketers
demonstrated Monday outside the offices of the Pfizer drug company,
saying its offer of free treatment for an AIDS-related brain
infection was insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ''The offer they are making will not do anything to dent the
epidemic,'' said Mazibuko Jara, spokesman for the HIV-AIDS
Treatment Action Campaign, a group that lobbies for cheaper
medication to fight the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators left after about 90 minutes of peaceful picketing,
Jara said. More protests were planned.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, a U.S. drug company, offered in April to supply poor
South Africans with free medication for cryptococcal meningitis, a
lethal brain infection that occurs in roughly one of 10
HIV-patients. Pfizer spokeswoman Thabi Nyide said the firm was
currently discussing its offer of free Diflucan with the South
African government.
</P>
<P>
   Jara said the group had received confidential information from
sources taking part in the negotiations that the patients would
receive the drug for only 2&AMP;frac12; years. That made the offer
meaningless, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nyide would not comment on whether there was a time limit to the
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, five other major drug companies said they would work
with African governments to slash overall costs of HIV/AIDS drugs
by 75 to 80 percent. South African Health Minister Manto
Tshabalala-Msimang called that offer a ''nonstarter,'' saying the
drugs would still be too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa has one of the world's highest rates of HIV
infection. The government estimates 10 percent of the country's 42
million people are infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

Polite Tone Of Canadian Alliance Race Evaporates
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- The polite tone of the Canadian Alliance
leadership race evaporated Monday at the start of Round 2, with
Preston Manning zooming in on Stockwell Day's sore spots.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, who trailed Day by eight percentage points in the first
ballot vote last weekend, took a pointed shot at his opponent's
conservative views on abortion and gay rights during a speech to
supporters in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   He also picked up the endorsement of Keith Martin, who finished
a distant fourth in the first round but is a leading voice of the
party's moderate wing.
</P>
<P>
   Manning must close the vote gap between himself and Day before
the runoff vote July 8. He needs to gather about 15,000 more votes,
either from some 85,000 party members who didn't vote last time or
supporters of failed candidate Tom Long.
75 Percent of McClelland and Stewart Donated
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- The Canadian publishing industry received a jolt
Monday when Avie Bennett, the owner of McClelland and Stewart, said
he was donating 75 percent of the company to the University of
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 25 percent of the country's best-known publisher
is being sold to Random House of Canada Ltd., which is ultimately
controlled by the German publishing giant Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
   ''After 15 years in the publishing business, I decided that it
was time for me to find a way of ensuring McClelland and Stewart's
future and preserving its past,'' the 73-year-old Bennett said in a
statement.
</P>

Depression-Era Paintings Demanded To Be Removed
</P>
<P>
   VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) -- Depression-era paintings of
bare-breasted aboriginal women on display at British Columbia's
legislature are demeaning and must be removed, say aboriginal
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''These paintings of bare-breasted aboriginal women and of
aboriginal persons in subservient positions are, we are sure you
will understand, highly offensive, demeaning and degrading to First
Nations people in the province,'' says a June 23 letter to Andrew
Petter, B.C.'s Attorney General and minister responsible for human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The mural depicts interaction between early European
colonialists and B.C. aboriginals during the mid 1800s, including
treaty signings, traditional greetings and trading meetings.
</P>
<P>
   One shows several bare-breasted aboriginal women carrying
cedar-woven baskets of salmon as aboriginal men and European
settlers unload a nearby ship.

<HEADLINE> Nader Urges More Federal Funding  </HEADLINE>
By LEON DROUIN KEITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ralph Nader faulted the federal government
Monday for its record on children's issues and said spending
proposals by the two major-party presidential contenders would
leave less money for programs benefiting the poorest youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ''This country needs a Marshall Plan for our nation's poor
children,'' the Green Party presidential candidate said during a
news conference at a downtown Los Angeles housing project.
</P>
<P>
   Children at William Mead Homes, a 55-year-old development with
lead paint on the walls and carcinogens in the soil, held ''Nader
2000'' signs and crowded around him.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, a longtime consumer advocate, called for an end to
''corporate welfare'' and criticized proposals by Republican George
W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore for billions of dollars in new
spending on Medicare, Social Security, tax cuts and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested increased funding on children's programs, including
child care and the cleanup of toxic sites. He also proposed a
guaranteed ''national minimum income'' for poor families.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, who won the Green Party's presidential nomination on
Sunday, said a strong showing in November would send a message for
Republicans and Democrats to ''shape up or shrink down.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have shown Nader registering in the single digits,
well behind Bush and Gore but ahead of Reform Party presidential
contender Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Nader called the heavily Hispanic housing project on the grounds
of a former oil refinery an example of environmental racism and
asserted that policies that essentially concentrate poor people in
polluted areas are a ''form of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Davis, an assistant director of the city housing authority,
who arrived as Nader was ending, chafed at the charges and said
that where people live is ''more of an issue of economics.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If the executive director could build housing in Beverly Hills
and charge 200 bucks a month, he'd do it in the blink of an eye,''
Davis said. ''But you and I know that's not going to happen.''

Human Genetic Code Deciphered
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a monumental achievement that opens a new frontier in
medicine, scientists announced today that the human genetic code essentially has
been deciphered. Leaders of competing public and private efforts said at a White
House ceremony that they have virtually completed assembly of what they called
''the book of life'' -- nature's genetic instruction manual for making and
maintaining human beings. Knowing the human genetic code, said President
Clinton, will give science ''an immense new power to heal'' by attacking disease
''at its genetic roots.''

Zimbabwe's Opposition Makes Gains
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Zimbabwe's main opposition party was making historic
gains in the country's most hotly contested parliamentary election since
independence 20 years ago, according to results released Monday. With results in
100 of 120 parliamentary districts announced, the main opposition Movement for
Democratic Change had won 48 seats and the ruling party 51, officials said
Monday. A small independent party won one seat. Such a closely contested race is
unprecedented in a country where President Robert Mugabe's party has ruled
virtually unchallenged since 1980.

Court Upholds Miranda Warnings

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court gave new power to its landmark Miranda
decision of 1966, ruling police still must warn the people they arrest of their
''right to remain silent'' when questioned. The 7-2 ruling today resolved a
bitter, 34-year debate over criminal suspects' rights and the Supreme Court
ruling many Americans know best. As a result, police still are required to give
the warnings made familiar to generations of Americans by movies and television

$1.9 Trillion Surplus Predicted

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton projected a $1.87 trillion budget
surplus for the next decade and asked Republicans to back prescription drugs

leaders all but scoffed at the proposal. Barely five months after estimating a
10-year surplus of $746 billion, the economy's relentless growth and the
resulting federal revenue let Clinton more than double that figure -- all
without counting Social Security's surpluses.

<HEADLINE> Serb Court Sentences 6 Albanians  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A Serbian court on Monday convicted
six Kosovo Albanians of conspiring against the state and sentenced
them each to 14 months in prison, the independent Beta news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The six were sentenced by a district court in the southern city
of Nis. Authorities said they had joined the now-disbanded Kosovo
Liberation Army in 1998 and participated in fighting against
Serbian security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, a southern Serbian province, was the scene of fierce
fighting between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's troops and
Kosovo's heavily ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   With the withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo in June 1999
and the deployment of NATO peacekeepers there, about 2,000 ethnic
Albanian prisoners were transferred to prisons in central Serbia.
At present, more than 900 Kosovo Albanians are jailed in Serbia.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Seeks Aid for Afghan Drought  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- A relentless drought in Afghanistan
threatens to send as many as 2 million thirsty people in search of
water -- possibly to Pakistan, itself a victim of a protracted dry
spell, the United Nations warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad, the
U. N. High Commissioner for Refugees appealed for emergency
international help. The appeal follows an earlier plea that has
been virtually ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations previously asked for $67 million to finance
emergency projects and supplies. So far, only $8.7 million has been
pledged -- and of that, only $200,000 has actually been received on
the ground in Afghanistan, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the U.N. agency is ''extremely concerned about the
worsening drought in Afghanistan and the threat of mass
displacement possibly to Pakistan and Iran.'' The drought in
Afghanistan is the worst there in 30 years, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, which currently provides refuge to at least 1.3
million Afghan refugees, is staggering under one of it worst dry
spells in decades in several southern provinces.

<HEADLINE> Mets 10, Marlins 5  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Benny Agbayani hit two of New York's season-high
five home runs, and Mike Piazza tied his team record by driving in
a run in his 10th straight game, leading the Mets to a 10-5 win
over the Florida Marlins on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Payton went 3-for-4 with a homer and three runs scored as
the Mets won their fifth straight to move within three games of
idle Atlanta in the NL East. Mark Johnson and Melvin Mora added
two-run shots, Mora's second homer in as many days.
</P>
<P>
   New York hit five home runs -- including three in the seventh
inning off Ron Mahay -- for the first time since Sept. 15, 1997,
against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins (38-39), who had won nine of 11 games, failed to
move over .500 this late in the season for the first time since
winning the World Series in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Al Leiter (9-1), a member of that Series-winning team before
being sent to New York in the ensuing salary purge, wasn't at his
best against his former team. He allowed solo homers to Mike Lowell
and Derrek Lee and at least one baserunner in each inning.
</P>
<P>
   But he was good enough to get the win thanks to New York's
offensive barrage. The left-hander allowed three runs, seven hits
and three walks in six innings to improve to 4-0 with a 2.38 ERA
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who went 2-for-3 to extend his hitting streak to 15
games, hit an RBI single in the Mets' three-run third inning. He
tied the team record for consecutive games with an RBI set Aug.
11-23 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani, batting in the eighth slot with Rey Ordonez out for
the season, hit a two-run homer in the third off Reid Cornelius
(2-2) and followed Payton's solo shot in the seventh with his sixth
homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Mora, replacing the three-time Gold Glove-winner Ordonez at
shortstop, hit his fifth homer in the season later in the seventh.
Mora has one more home run in 122 at-bats this season than Ordonez
has in 2,016 career at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   After Cliff Floyd tied the game at 3 with an RBI single in the
fifth, the Mets went ahead for good in the bottom half. Derek Bell
singled with one out, and Edgardo Alfonzo and Piazza followed with
walks to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura, the active leader in grand slams with 14, then
hit an RBI groundout to second to put New York up 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, pinch-hitting for Leiter in the sixth, hit his first
homer run since 1997. The three homers in the seventh made it 10-3.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Cook came on after Rich Rodriguez allowed two runs in the
eighth, and struck out Floyd with the bases loaded to end the
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter got out of a first and second, no-out jam in the first
with help from his defense. Bell made a diving catch of Floyd's
sinking liner to right and Ventura started a 5-4-3 double play to
end the threat.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The game was delayed 33 minutes by rain in the top of the
second inning. ... Bell left the game in the seventh inning with
slight dehydration. ... Piazza has 19 RBIs during the 10-game
streak. ... Lee has four homers in his last three games. ...
Florida 2B Luis Castillo, second in the majors with 32 steals, was
caught stealing in the fifth inning by Piazza. ... Cornelius
pitched for the Mets in 1995, going 3-7 with a 5.15 ERA. ... The
Mets have five pinch-hit homers this season.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Gonzalez Deadline Passes  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- The deal is dead. Juan's not gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' tentative trade for Juan Gonzalez collapsed Monday
when the Detroit Tigers right fielder rejected a one-year, $12.5
million contract extension offered by New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good, I like it,'' Tigers manager Phil Garner said when told
the proposed deal had fallen apart. ''I thought it was going to
work out that way anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees agreed last Thursday to the 3-for-1 trade with
Detroit for the two-time AL MVP, but he had a no-trade clause that
allowed him to block the deal. The commissioner's office then gave
the sides until Sunday to complete the trade, a deadline that was
pushed back a day.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez and the Tigers finished pregame batting practice
moments after Monday's 6 p.m. deadline passed. Gonzalez, who had
little to say during the weekend as rumors swirled, raised his arms
over his head and said, ''No, no'' as he headed toward the Tigers'
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Juan just wants to be left alone to play,'' Garner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, back in the Tigers' lineup at DH for Monday's game,
went 3-for-4 with an RBI triple as Detroit pounded the Indians
13-2.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy. We win. That's it,'' was all Gonzalez had to say
after the game.
</P>
<P>
   While Gonzalez was willing to go to New York without an
extension, which would allow him to become a free agent after the
season, the Yankees wouldn't agree to complete the deal on those
terms.
</P>
<P>
   New York originally agreed to send outfielder Ricky Ledee to
Detroit along with two minor leaguers: third baseman Drew Henson
and pitcher Randy Keisler.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees decided Monday that if Gonzalez wouldn't agree to an
extension, they would decrease their offer to the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently they went back to Detroit and tried to rework it as
a three-month rental,'' said Gonzalez's agent, Jim Bronner, who did
not make a counter offer when his client rejected the Yankees'
one-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   New York for the first time confirmed the tentative trade when
the Yankees announced its collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Yankees appreciate the professionalism show by Juan
Gonzalez, his agent, Jim Bronner, and the Detroit Tigers,'' New
York spokesman Rick Cerrone said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, eligible for free agency after the season, is making
$7.5 million this year, and has been said to have turned down a
$140 million, eight-year extension from the Tigers that would have
made him the sport's highest-paid player.
</P>
<P>
   Bronner said he informed the Yankees at 10 a.m. EDT Sunday that
his client was willing to waive the no-trade clause, but said New
York didn't get back with a proposal offer until after 4 p.m. EDT
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They made an offer of a one-year contract, and it was not
accepted,'' he said, saying both the money and the length were
issues of disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are considering possible deals for several others
players, including Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs, B.J. Surhoff of
the Baltimore Orioles and Ellis Burks of the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Bronner said that after he told the Yankees of his client's
position on Sunday, he spoke with New York owner George
Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   ''George indicated he was excited about it, that Juan was his
first choice,'' Bronner said.
</P>
<P>
   Bronner said that on Monday morning, Yankees president Randy
Levine said he would call back within five minutes to make a
proposal but then never called back.
</P>
<P>
   ''My guess is they're just going in some other direction,''
Bronner said Monday afternoon, even before receiving the Yankees'
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez arrived at Jacobs Field at 4 p.m. for Monday night's
game dressed smartly in a dark blue suit. After entering the
Tigers' clubhouse, he paused to fill out a request form for
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ''No comment,'' he said. ''There's nothing going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez spent nearly an hour in the trainer's room getting
treatment for a left ankle injury he sustained Saturday night when
he fouled a ball off his lower leg. The injury kept him out of
Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   While on the training table, Gonzalez was seen talking on his
cell phone as many of the Tigers outside wondered what was going
on.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez took some batting practice in the indoor cages to test
his ankle and at 5:10 p.m. was approached by Garner to see if he
could play the finale of Detroit's five-game series with the
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez emerged from the clubhouse a few moments later to join
his teammates who had already begun their pregame stretching.
</P>
<P>
   Garner said Gonzalez told him from the beginning that he wanted
to stay in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told me he didn't want to go,'' Garner said. ''He said he
wished he was doing better but that he was happy in Detroit and
wanted to stay. I can only go by what Juan told me.''
</P>
<P>
   Garner doesn't think the Tigers will try to make another deal
for Gonzalez before the July 31 trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm planning on having him here for the rest of the year no
matter what deadlines we get to,'' Garner said.
</P>
<P>
   News that the deal had collapsed swept quickly through the
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm kind of like the fact that he's not going to New York,''
Indians general manager John Hart said. ''I'm a selfish guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, in Detroit for a three-game series against the
Tigers beginning Tuesday, still appear to be intrigued by the
possibility of obtaining Sosa, who would be a big hit in New York's
Dominican community.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, we're in a position where we have to wait to see if
there's a condition deal made by Chicago with somebody,'' said
Sosa's agent, Tom Reich. ''If and when that happens, we will move
very swiftly into the window.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs, according to a Yankees official speaking on the
condition of anonymity, gave New York several combinations of
players they would accept for Sosa, and there have been
back-and-forth talks.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago appears to have become impressed with Alex Graman, a
left-hander from Indiana State drafted by the Yankees in the third
round in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Residents and politicians attack nuclear plant's operations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CORTLANDT MANOR, N.Y. (AP) - The 144-seat town hall here was
jammed Sunday with residents and politicians angry at what they
said was a nuclear power plant ripe for more accidents like the
Feb. 15 radiation leak.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, and Reps. Benjamin A. Gilman, Nita
Lowey and Sue Kelly were among those who told Nuclear Regulatory
Commission representatives at a public meeting the Indian Point
plant should remain closed until aging steam generators were
upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole darn system is faulty,'' Gilman said. According to
Gilman's staff, Indian Point is the only nuclear power reactor in
the country still using the Westinghouse Model 44 steam generators.
</P>
<P>
   The NRC is currently reviewing a report from plant owner
Consolidated Edison, who is pushing to reopen the plant with
existing steam generators.
</P>
<P>
   There's no timetable detailing when the NRC may make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won't allow the plant to restart until we're assured it can
operate safely,'' NRC spokeswoman Diane Screnci told the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Though the NRC concluded that the leak produced trace amounts of
radiation outside the plant, the incident prompted something more
than fear.
</P>
<P>
   It triggered the kind of scrutiny that has critics calling into
question everything from emergency evacuation procedures and plant
safety to ConEd's culpability in the February accident.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have argued that Indian Point operators have had
replacement generators on site for years before moving to replace
them. Replacement costs are estimated at $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents said the plant should be brought off-line for
good.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only safe thing to do is close,'' said Rose Marie
Williams, of the New Paltz-based Cancer Awareness Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a problem for anyone in the mid-Hudson area.''

   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Byron Scott, one of three candidates to
coach the Indiana Pacers, has accepted an offer to coach the New
Jersey Nets instead, according to a published report.
</P>
<P>
   The Indianapolis Star, in a story for Tuesday's editions, quoted
unidentified sources as saying Scott would be introduced Tuesday as
the Nets' new coach, replacing interim coach Don Casey.
</P>
<P>
   Scott told friends Monday that he believes Isiah Thomas will be
chosen to replace Larry Bird in Indiana, The Star reported.
</P>
<P>
   Bird, a Hall of Famer who had never coached a game at any level
when he was hired by the Pacers, proved a coaching track record
isn't a prerequisite for success in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Pacers president Donnie Walsh says there still is no
front-runner for the job. He told The Star that no announcement
would be made before the NBA draft Wednesday night. Besides Scott
and Thomas, Walsh also has interviewed Pacers assistant Rick
Carlisle, a former teammate of Bird in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I see all the time is people telling Isiah he's going to
get the job and he seemingly not denying it, acting like, 'Well, if
it happens ...,''' Walsh said of media reports that Thomas will be
hired. ''He understands the situation, understands a decision
hasn't been made.
</P>
<P>
   ''What can I say? The decision will be made when the decision's
made,'' Walsh said. ''Then we'll make an announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was a 12-time All-Star during his 13-year career with the
Detroit Pistons. After he retired as a player, he became general
manager and part owner of the Toronto Raptors and last year bought
the Continental Basketball Association for $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   If he were to become a coach in the NBA, he would have to sell
the CBA, which, he said recently, would not be a deal-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh already has said the next coach likely will not have a
role in management, as Bird did with part-ownership of the Pacers.
He also said Bird's decision last week to turn down a front-office
job would not hurt Carlisle's chances to become coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''It never put him in the mix and it wouldn't take him out of
the mix,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he spoke to Bird about the coaching possibilities but
would not say whether Bird had voiced a preference.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever his influence has been to me, he understands kind of
where I'm coming from. Whether we would do the same thing (in
making a selection), I'm not sure,'' Walsh said. ''The players are
pretty neutral on it. They know who the candidates are.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that means the next coach is someone who already has
star name recognition, as Thomas does, or already knows the players
and the organization, as Scott and Carlisle do, is secondary, Jalen
Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love to win and I want to continue to have the Pacers in a
situation to win,'' he said. ''I want us to have the fact we made
it to the NBA championship to be a constant. I want us to continue
to be on top of the league, an elite team in our conference like we
have been the last couple of seasons and find a way to win the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know the three candidates are all people who could do a good
job, given the opportunity,'' Rose said. ''So it just basically
boils down to who Donnie thinks can do the best job for the future
of the franchise.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Taiwanese President To Britain  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Making his first visit abroad since
retirement, former Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui flew to Britain
on Tuesday, a surprise trip that could raise tensions with rival
China.
</P>
<P>
   Before Lee retired last month, Beijing tried to block the
outspoken Taiwanese leader's efforts to travel to nations that
don't have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, fearing that such
visits would give his government legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Since China and Taiwan split amid civil war in 1949, Beijing has
considered the island to be a renegade province unworthy of formal
ties with other countries.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, Lee flew to Britain for a private visit,
said Christina Chen, spokeswoman at the British Trade and Cultural
Office. The office serves as Britain's de facto embassy in Taipei
because London does not have formal diplomatic relations with
Taiwan. Chen said she had no further details about Lee's travel
plans.
</P>
<P>
   China did not immediately comment on Lee's trip.
</P>
<P>
   Lee planned to attend his granddaughter's high school graduation
ceremony in Britain, said the state-run Broadcasting Corporation of
China and Central News Agency. He planned to return on July 2, the
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has long reviled Lee and has repeatedly accused him of
trying to push Taiwan toward independence -- a move China has warned
it would use force to stop. Lee has repeatedly said he supports
reunification once China is more democratic and economically
advanced.
</P>
<P>
   When Lee visited the United States in 1995 to attend a class
reunion at Cornell University, China conducted war games and fired
missiles into the seas near Taiwan. It recalled its ambassador to
Washington and suspended negotiations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   This is Lee's first trip abroad since he retired after 12 years
in office. He has long expressed an interest in visiting Japan, but
Tokyo was reluctant to approve a visa while he was president.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has also said he would like to visit several Latin American
nations, who are among about 30 nations -- most of them small,
impoverished countries -- that recognize the Taipei government. Lee,
an agricultural economist, has said he would like to help advise
farmers in the nations.

<HEADLINE> Co. Lab To Study Parks' Health  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WELLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The country's 378 national parks, monuments and
historical sites will undergo a massive diagnostic study to assess
where repairs are needed and establish a checklist to measure
future wear and tear.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado State University ecologists and scientists from the
U.S. Geological Survey will conduct the survey independently of the
National Park Service, which already estimates up to $6 billion in
backlogged repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The program will be patterned after an ecological assessment
conducted by Parks Canada in that country's 39 national parks.
</P>
<P>
   It revealed ''significant to severe'' ecological stresses in 31
of Canada's parks and an increase in the intensity of the stresses
in 13 of those parks since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Park expert Mark Peterson said ''I suspect our American parks
could be just as degraded, if not more so, than Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   The crush of visitors -- 65 million people to 54 national parks
alone -- has left many suffering from traffic congestion, air
pollution, vandalism, and an invasion of alien plant species.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, manager of research for the National Parks
Conservation Association, said the CSU project will be done in
three phases over four years.
</P>
<P>
   It includes a plan to develop a ''vital signs chart'' for parks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Park Service is very interested in finding where their
weak spots are but their funding is very limited for comprehensive
assessments like this,'' Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Parks Conservation Association and the National
Trust for Historic Preservation organized the study and are
arranging its financing.

Human Genetic Code Deciphered
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists announced Monday that the human genetic code
essentially has been deciphered, in a monumental achievement that opens a new
frontier in medicine. Leaders of competing public and private efforts said at a
White House ceremony that they have virtually completed assembly of what they
called ''the book of life'' -- nature's genetic instruction manual for making
and maintaining human beings. President Clinton said knowing the human genetic
codewill give science ''an immense new power to heal'' by attacking disease ''at
its genetic roots.''

Court Upholds Miranda Warnings
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court gave new power to its landmark Miranda
decision of 1966, ruling police still must warn the people they arrest of their
''right to remain silent'' when questioned. The 7-2 ruling Monday resolved a
bitter, 34-year debate over criminal suspects' rights and the Supreme Court
ruling many Americans know best. As a result, police still are required to give
the warnings made familiar to generations of Americans by movies and television
or else risk getting suspects' confessions excluded as evidence against them.

$1.9 Trillion Surplus Predicted

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton projected a $1.87 trillion budget
surplus for the next decade and asked Republicans to back prescription drugs
benefits in exchange for a tax cut. Sensing a possible election-year trap, GOP
leaders all but scoffed at the proposal. Barely five months after estimating a
10-year surplus of $746 billion, the economy's relentless growth and the
resulting federal revenue let Clinton more than double that figure -- all
without counting Social Security's surpluses.

Padres Put Tony Gwynn on DL
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Tired of being reduced to a part-time player, Tony Gwynn
will undergo arthroscopic surgery on his troublesome left knee Tuesday. The San
Diego Padres batting star hopes that doctors will only have to clean out the
joint, which has little cartilage left in it due to five previous surgeries. In
a best-case scenario, the 40-year-old Gwynn figures he would miss at least 4 to
6 weeks. If doctors find more serious damage or decide to perform a procedure to
get new cartilage to grow, there's a chance Gwynn could miss the rest of the
season.

<HEADLINE> Horse Trainer Lucien Laurin Dies  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME HERNANDEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Hall of Fame trainer Lucien Laurin, who saddled
Secretariat to the Triple Crown in 1973, died Monday at 88.
</P>
<P>
   Laurin died at Baptist Hospital. He broke his hip in a fall last
week and died after complications from surgery, according to a
friend of the family who spoke from Laurin's home in Key Largo.
</P>
<P>
   After winning 161 races as a jockey, Laurin began a 45-year
training career in 1942, working in New England. He trained for
Reginald Webster and A.B. Hancock Jr. and then moved to Meadow
Stable, where he won five of six Triple Crown races with Riva Ridge
and Secretariat in 1972 and 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had retired before I hired him,'' said Penny Chenery, owner
of the stable. ''His son, Roger, was training for me but he moved
to the Phipps family. He said, 'My dad will help you out.' I called
him 'my temporary trainer.'''
</P>
<P>
   Laurin came to Meadow Stable in 1971. There he found Riva Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was tall and gangly with a lot of speed,'' Chenery said.
''His first stakes start was at Saratoga. Something told me I had
to be there. It was our first stakes win with Lucien.''
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Laurin had the 2-year-old Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't want me to know how much he thought of him,''
Chenery said of the trainer and the thoroughbred. ''He took
Secretariat to Florida in January of 1972. He would say to me, 'He
doesn't show me anything. He doesn't work good. He's just a big,
fat lazy thing.'
</P>
<P>
   ''Lucien had a fiery temper. When Secretariat lost his first
race, Lucien kicked a chair across the box and said, 'That horse
should never be beaten.' That's when I realized what Lucien thought
of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretariat won the Kentucky Derby in a record 1:59 2/5 and then
went on to take the Preakness and complete the Triple Crown,
winning the Belmont by 31 lengths. His jockey was Ron Turcotte.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a sad day for me,'' Turcotte said after learning of
Laurin's death. ''He was like a father to me. I can't say enough
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurin put Turcotte on Riva Ridge and won the 1972 Kentucky
Derby with him. In the months before the Derby, Riva Ridge was at
Hialeah.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was anxious to see him,'' the jockey said.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of stalls down, Laurin introduced the jockey to another
2-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said to me, 'Look at this beautiful horse,''' Turcotte
recalled. ''It was Secretariat.''
</P>
<P>
   The seeds for the 1973 Triple Crown were planted.
</P>
<P>
   Laurin had 36 stakes winners but none more memorable than the
two Meadow Farms stars.
</P>
<P>
   Laurin is survived by his wife, Juliette, and son Roger, who has
been a trainer since 1956. Funeral arrangements were pending.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- San Francisco Giants left-hander Kirk Rueter left
the game against the Colorado Rockies on Monday night after being
hit by a line drive in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rueter, who allowed four runs on four hits in the inning, was
struck above the right ankle by Neifi Perez's liner. Rueter
scrambled after the ball and threw home as the Giants caught
Jeffrey Hammonds, who was on third base, in a rundown.
</P>
<P>
   Rueter was unable to continue and was replaced by Mark Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to Denver's Rose Medical Center for precautionary
X-rays, which proved negative. A team spokesman said the injury was
a bruise, and Rueter's status is day-to-day.
