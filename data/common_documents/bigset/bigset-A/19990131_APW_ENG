<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- General Challenge beat Buck Trout by  
three lengths Sunday to win the $106,500 Santa Catalina Stakes at 
Santa Anita Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Buck Trout jumped out to an early lead, but 4-5 favorite General  
Challenge pulled even in the upper stretch before pulling away. It 
was his third victory under Gary Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge, who carried 117 pounds, covered the 1  
1-16-mile course in 1:42 4-5. He paid $3.60, $2.40 and $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Buck Trout, the 9-5 second choice, returned $2.80 and $2.10.  
Brilliantly finished one length behind and paid $2.10 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens had originally planned to attend the Super Bowl in Miami  
but changed his mind after a morning workout with General Challenge 
on Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``After I worked him, I didn't want to miss a horse of this  
caliber to watch a football game,'' Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge received $63,900 for the victory, increasing  
his career earnings to $173,700.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Robinson Burnt in Big Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Eugene Robinson is one of the NFL's most respected  
players. 
</P>
<P>
	His bubbly, infectious leadership was a major reason the Atlanta  
Falcons reached their first Super Bowl. His strong religious 
beliefs, usually espoused in sermonlike fashion, seemed to make him 
a role model in this era of misbehaving athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	But Saturday night, less than 24 hours before the Super Bowl,  
the Pro Bowl safety was arrested on a downtown Miami street, 
charged with soliciting an undercover police officer for oral sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe it ... anybody but Eugene,'' linebacker Henri  
Crockett said Sunday in the lobby of his team's hotel. ``I know 
what kind of person he is. There has to be something more to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the arrest, Falcons coach Dan Reeves allowed Robinson to  
start Sunday night against the Denver Broncos, the first NFL 
championship game in Atlanta's 33-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons lost 34-19, with Robinson burned on the game's  
biggest play -- an 80-yard TD pass to Rod Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love Eugene unconditionally,'' said Reeves, speaking  
poolside during a pregame TV show. ``As far as I'm concerned, and 
as far as the league is concerned, he can play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson warmed up as normal before the game, stopping to shake  
hands with head linesman Sanford Rivers. He also hugged teammates 
Ray Buchanan and Travis Hall in between drills. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons defense took the field for the first time just over  
five minutes into the game, and Robinson broke up Denver's first 
play: a pass from John Elway that was intended for Terrell Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson's father, Samuel, said the defensive back needed to  
play to help him work through his troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lesson here somewhere,'' he said in the hotel lobby  
before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson remained in seclusion at the hotel and didn't comment  
on his arrest before the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Robinson was arrested at 9 p.m. on Biscayne  
Boulevard, a major street frequented by prostitutes and drug 
dealers. He was driving alone in a rented car. 
</P>
<P>
	``While conducting an undercover prostitution sting, defendant  
drove up ... and offered the officer $40 for (oral sex),'' the 
police report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The misdemeanor charge carries a maximum sentence of 60 days in  
jail, but most first-time offenders are offered some combination of 
community service, attending a course on the dangers of 
solicitation and a fine, said police spokesman Angel Calzadilla. 
The car was impounded and will cost $1,000 to retrieve. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five people were arrested in the undercover operation,  
including a suspect in three killings in Pennsylvania, Calzadilla 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday morning, Robinson was honored with the Bart Starr  
Award by the religious group Athletes in Action. Balloting is 
conducted among NFL players to select the person who displays 
``high moral character.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, even as Christians, we do things wrong,''  
Reeves said. ``We're all sinners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later Saturday, Robinson lounged by the hotel pool with his  
wife, Gia, and their 9-year-old son, Brandon. The couple also has 
an 11-year-old daughter, Brittany. 
</P>
<P>
	Also attending the game were Robinson's mother and several  
aunts, uncles and cousins. 
</P>
<P>
	``The children asked questions. They have feelings,'' Samuel  
Robinson said. ``My son talked to both kids, and that's a good 
deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samuel Robinson said he was ``very concerned'' for his  
daughter-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's doing better today,'' he said. ``She had to compose  
herself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive tackle Shane Dronett said the Falcons remained intent  
on concentrating on the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to let it distract us,'' he said. ``We'll  
stand beside Eugene. Until he says something we're not worried 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dronett added, ``I'm sure he's innocent. He was probably in the  
wrong place at the wrong time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was released from Miami police headquarters around 11  
p.m. to Falcons general manager Harold Richardson. The player 
promised to return for a court appearance, which is usually 
scheduled within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	After being released, Robinson was consoled in his hotel room by  
several teammates, including Buchanan and linebacker Cornelius 
Bennett, according to Samuel Robinson, who also was in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't say anything about what happened, and I didn't ask  
him,'' the father said. ``But you could see he was crushed. I've 
never seen my son with that look of concern and disappointment in 
his entire life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett spent more than a month in jail during the last  
offseason after pleading guilty to sexual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bennett has been there before,'' Samuel Robinson said. ``I'm  
glad he was there to support Eugene. He let him know, `We're here 
for you as a team.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who played in the last two Super Bowls with Green Bay,  
is the NFL's career leader among active players with 53 
interceptions, including four this season. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed with the Falcons as a free agent and became the  
unquestioned leader of the secondary, earning Pro Bowl honors and 
bringing a winning attitude to a franchise that was used to losing. 
All week, he wore his 1997 Super Bowl ring to inspire his 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest is yet one more difficult side issue this season for  
the Falcons, following Reeves' heart bypass surgery in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't put Eugene Robinson aside, but we've got to do the  
best we can,'' Reeves said. ``We've done a good job dealing with 
distractions this year.''

<HEADLINE> U of Chicago Changes Its Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A reputation for high-minded academics and record  
number of Nobel Prize winners just isn't enough anymore for the 
University of Chicago. It's time to ease up a bit, kick back a 
little, maybe get a life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, there's a perception out there that this is a  
place without fun,'' said Al Chambers, the university's new vice 
president for university relations, recruited to make the 
107-year-old school more marketable. 
</P>
<P>
	The school wants to attract additional superior students who  
would normally favor schools seen as having a more diverse campus 
life, such as Harvard, Yale and Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
	It also faces competition from its northern neighbor,  
Northwestern University, whose academic reputation has grown at the 
same time it has emphasized athletics and campus social life. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may have become just a little too content in believing our  
academic power by itself would be enough,'' said university 
president Hugo Sonnenschein. 
</P>
<P>
	The university is planning to reduce required courses in favor  
of more electives, add foreign studies programs and improve student 
living quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	There's even a recruiting drive under way for athletes and a  
plan for a new athletic center, both big steps for a school that 
dropped out of the Big Ten in 1939, reasoning that sports 
distracted from academics. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the school's name is no longer good enough. University  
officials would like to ban the shorthand ``U of C '' in favor of 
simply calling the institution ``Chicago.''

<HEADLINE> Online Auction Customers Beware </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When Sotheby's sold a Harry S. Truman signature  
that turned out to be a reproduction, the prestigious auction house 
apologized and bought it back. 
</P>
<P>
	On the explosive frontier of Internet auctions, the policy is  
different: bidder beware. 
</P>
<P>
	Toy collector Christina Platthy says she found out too late --  
after paying $1,815 for a rare Beanie Baby she bought in an eBay 
Web site auction and getting a $5 stuffed duck instead. 
</P>
<P>
	The rapid, raucous popularity of Internet auction houses has  
left consumers prey to cyber-scams and emerging companies like eBay 
struggling to prevent a new kind of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, founded in 1995 by Pierre Omidyar in San Jose,  
Calif. to sell his girlfriend's Pez dispensers, is the most famous 
of the online auctioneers, but it has no less than 1,500 rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Auction houses say they can't be forced to protect consumers  
against bogus buys, any more than a newspaper can be held 
responsible for the claims of its classified advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think from a legal point of view we have no liability,''  
said eBay CEO Meg Whitman. However, she added, ``We actually have a 
significant responsibility to make eBay as safe a site as possible 
to trade on. We also need to communicate that users have a 
responsibility as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman says fraud is exceptionally rare among its 1 million  
users -- less than 1/100th of 1 percent of its 700,000 daily 
auctions. 
</P>
<P>
	But, many users report their problems elsewhere. The National  
Consumers League gets 600 complaints a month about Internet fraud. 
Two out of three are auction fraud cases. 
</P>
<P>
	As the largest auction house, eBay has had its share of mishaps.  
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvanian Jamison Piatt was turned in by angry buyers who  
never got the Furby toys he promised. He's agreed to repay them 
$3,600. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidders aren't always honest either. Some offered up to $200,000  
for a ``Today'' show jacket signed by host Katie Couric. After 
bogus bids were ferreted out, the jacket sold for $11,400. Starting 
next month, deadbeat bidders will be suspended from eBay. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems may stem in part from the industry's stratospheric  
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Market researcher Jupiter Communications estimates that the  
number of Internet auction customers will jump nearly sixfold from 
1.2 million to 6.5 million by 2000, when they will spend about $7.1 
billion. For eBay, sales grew 724 percent in 1998, to $47.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	As the industry grows, so does fraud. Cyber-scams are prevalent  
enough that Manhattan attorney Brian Brokate has a full-time staff 
tracking online knockoffs of luxury goods made by clients such as 
Rolex and Vuitton. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City is trying to hold online auction houses  
accountable. The city's Department of Consumer Affairs said last 
week it is looking into whether some eBay sellers are falsely 
labeling baseballs supposedly signed by such legends as Babe Ruth 
and Roberto Clemente, as ``one-of-a-kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Whitman says eBay's glad to cooperate, even though the city  
hasn't notified eBay of the probe. 
</P>
<P>
	In an acknowledgment that fraud is a problem, eBay said earlier  
this month it would guarantee items from $25 to $200. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't help high bidders like Ms. Platthy.  
</P>
<P>
	She says she paid for a rare ``Quackers'' Beanie manufactured  
without wings, but got a cheaper version with the wings obviously 
cut off. Seller Mark R. Mills of Las Vegas, who was ejected from 
eBay last year, responds: ``She got what she paid for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Platthy wants New York officials to force eBay to vouch for  
its sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad that they're trying to crack down on them,'' she  
said, adding that Mills didn't give her his real name. ``The person 
I was dealing with did not exist. That's what irritates me about 
eBay. They don't check anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best way for auction house customers to protect themselves  
is to use an escrow service that will hold onto their check until 
the auctioned item is received in good condition, said eBay's Ms. 
Whitman. The company makes that easy by offering online links to 
escrow companies. The catch: a 5 percent fee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eighteen-hundred dollars is a lot of money and using escrow is  
probably a pretty smart thing to do when you are dealing with that 
kind of money,'' Ms. Whitman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokate concedes that online auctioneers probably can't be held  
legally responsible unless they're informed of a specific fraud and 
refuse to act. He said eBay has been quick to help so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Two traditional auction houses could shake up the industry with  
their plans to go online later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotheby's says its items will be guaranteed and its rival  
Christie's is expected to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that a collector ... needs to have the assurance  
that experts have properly assessed what is being sold and that 
that item is being guaranteed,'' said David Redden, executive vice 
president of Sotheby's.

<HEADLINE> Gordon Interceptions Derail Falcons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Darrien Gordon's two interceptions for a  
record-setting 108 yards were impressive enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Two touchdowns would have been even better, but high humidity  
and a hard hit from Jamal Anderson gave Gordon rubbery legs, and he 
had to settle for the single-game and Super Bowl career return 
yardage records. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon had four second-half interceptions in the Denver Broncos'  
last two victories, a 23-10 win over the New York Jets in the AFC 
championship game and Sunday night's 34-19 victory over the Atlanta 
Falcons in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gordon was a little disappointed that he didn't take  
Sunday's interceptions for touchdowns, especially because he was 
tackled by Chris Chandler, the Falcons' quarterback, on the first 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took a shot to the head from Jamal Anderson in the first  
half, and I think that's why I lost my legs a little on the two 
returns,'' Gordon said. ``I think I was knocked out for a few 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family won't let me live it down that I was tackled by  
Chris Chandler, and my teammates will let me have it, too. I 
usually take those plays for touchdowns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You got to beat the quarterback in the open field,'' defensive  
backfield teammate Tyrone Braxton said. ``We won't let him get a 
big head about the interceptions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon credited defensive tackle Keith Traylor with deflecting  
the pass from Chandler that Gordon picked off in the third quarter. 
He returned it 58 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were looking at the quarterback trying to get a good break  
on the ball, Traylor tipped it and I was able to get to the ball,'' 
Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon said he anticipated the Falcons' pass route on the second  
interception that he returned 50 yards to stop the Falcons' sixth 
drive inside the 30. At that time, they had only six points. 
</P>
<P>
	``The route was the same one that (Kansas City's) Andre Rison  
beat us for a touchdown this season, and I was waiting for that 
one,'' Gordon said. ``I think the second one really took the life 
out of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The previous records for a game and a career were 77 yards by  
Dallas' Larry Brown against Pittsburgh in 1996. Brown won the Super 
Bowl MVP for that performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The most interceptions in a Super Bowl game is three by Rod  
Martin of Oakland against Philadelphia in 1981. The longest 
interception return is 75 yards by Willie Brown of Oakland against 
Minnesota in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon said he was tired of hearing that the Broncos' secondary  
is the weak link of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teams down 30 points have to throw the ball 50 times, and that  
leads to a lot of 300-yard passing games,'' he said. ``The way our 
defense is set up, we try to stop the run and make the other team 
one-dimensional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon said the Broncos' defensive line ``did a great job with  
pressure to force Chandler into bad decisions. I was fortunate to 
be in the right place at the right time.''

<HEADLINE> Griffith Scores Twice for Denver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The unsung member of the Denver Broncos' backfield  
outdid Terrell Davis when it came to scoring touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Griffith scored on a pair of 1-yard runs in Denver's  
34-19 victory Sunday over the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Griff doesn't get enough credit for the job he does,'' Davis  
said. ``He likes to run the ball, but he doesn't beg for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, the NFL most valuable player, carried 25 times for 102  
yards. But it was Griffith that the Broncos turned to when they 
were near the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
	His first touchdown gave Denver the lead for good, 7-3. He  
scored again for a 24-6 lead on the first play of the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith almost had a third touchdown, but John Elway barely  
overthrew him on a potential 37-yard scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos' fullback finished with four carries for 9 yards.  
</P>
<P>
	And 12 points.

<HEADLINE> French Insurer Bids for Brit Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- French insurer Axa SA has submitted a $5.7 billion  
bid for British insurer Guardian Royal Exchange PLC, according to a 
published report. 
</P>
<P>
	GRE, a general insurer focusing on auto, home and healthcare  
insurance, has attracted several bids since it put itself up for 
auction late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Sunday Telegraph and Sunday Business newspapers said  
Axa, Europe's second-largest insurer, has re-entered the bid battle 
by upping its initial offer to head off rival bidders Royal &AMP; Sun 
Alliance PLC, the British composite insurer, and Eureko, an 
Amsterdam-based alliance of seven European insurers. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision could come as soon as Monday, the newspapers said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Sunday Business reported Axa, which offers life and property  
insurance among other services, is mulling an offer that it would 
make through its majority-owned U.K. subsidiary Sun Life &AMP; 
Provincial PLC, though the Sunday Telegraph said Axa has already 
made a bid.

<HEADLINE> La. GOP Want 2000 Caucus Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Louisiana Republican Party leaders  
agreed to again bump Iowa for the spot as the nation's first GOP 
presidential battleground. 
</P>
<P>
	The approval vote Saturday came amid concerns that the move  
could flounder like the 1996 effort, which suffered from a 
candidate boycott and overcrowded polling places. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will start the presidential process off with some spice,''  
said Rep. Tony Perkins. ``They will have gumbo instead of corn 
soup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican State Central Committee's 125-32 vote authorized  
a special 15-member committee to iron out costs and determine how 
many polling places will be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an embarrassment and it will be again unless this  
committee puts together a plan that allows 600,000 Republicans in 
this state immediate and easy access to the polls,'' state Rep. 
Charles Lancaster said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, about 20,000 Louisiana Republicans voted at 42  
precincts, some waiting in line as long as two hours to vote, 
Lancaster said. Iowa's caucus drew about 100,000 voters at 2,000 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can promise you we will not have the ... problems we had  
last time,'' said Dianne Christopher, the party's vice chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa Republicans have said they will defend their state's place  
as the first caucus, and four years ago they successfully urged 
presidential contenders to shun Louisiana's caucus. Only two 
candidates participated in Louisiana's previous venture, 
conservative Pat Buchanan and U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm. Neither mounted 
a serious challenge to former Sen. Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana's voting date wasn't set. Iowa's voting is tentatively  
scheduled for Feb. 7, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Man With Gun Removed From Course  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- A fan heckling Tiger Woods at the  
Phoenix Open on Sunday was arrested after police discovered a 
handgun concealed in his fanny pack. 
</P>
<P>
	The man, Brian K. Murphy, 40, of Phoenix, followed the final  
threesome, which included Woods, tournament winner Rocco Mediate 
and Harrison Frazar, for four holes of the final round, Sgt. Doug 
Dirren said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Murphy was yelling at Woods and using abusive language  
near the sixth tee area when officer Rob Rucker, who was assigned 
to follow Woods and was wearing only a modified uniform designed to 
blend with the crowd, told him to be quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy, who had been drinking, became belligerent and persisted,  
even though Rucker identified himself as an officer, Dirren said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time, the guy turned toward him (Rucker) again and  
started using abusive language, and then lunged at the officer,'' 
Dirren said. ``The guy was yelling, `What are you going to do? 
Arrest me?' and the officer had to subdue him by putting him on the 
ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy had a permit to carry a concealed weapon, and Dirren did  
not know if the semiautomatic pistol was loaded. 
</P>
<P>
	He was booked on suspicion of aggravated assault, a felony, and  
misdemeanor disorderly conduct, then released on his own 
recognizance pending submission of the charges to the Maricopa 
County attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods and Mediate, who played in the final threesome with  
Harrison Frazar, were not aware Murphy was armed until after the 
event ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just kept walking,'' Woods said. ``Rocco and I were walking  
down the fairway and just kind of talking about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mediate heard a man using vulgar language.  
</P>
<P>
	``An officer told him to watch his mouth, and he pushed him,''  
Mediate said. ``Wrong thing to do. The officer put him on his back 
right away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Told the man had a gun, Mediate asked for confirmation. Then he  
said, ``Oh no. It's just a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods had seen something similar in Dallas when he was a  
teen-ager attending Stanford. He was playing a practice round when 
two women approached. 
</P>
<P>
	``A policeman asked them what they were doing there, and they  
kind of lost it,'' Woods said. When the officer checked, he found 
guns in the backpacks of both women.

<HEADLINE> Union Worries Over GM Spinoff Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Leaders of the International United Auto  
Workers are opposed to General Motors Corp.'s pending spinoff of 
Delta Automotive Systems, worrying about job and wage cuts as the 
auto parts company tries to become more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all workers are against it. At two Delphi brake plants  
in Dayton, UAW Local 696 leaders say they are keeping an open mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hesitate to say we (fully) support the spinoff because  
there are too many variables involved and there is always an empty 
pit in your stomach when you leave GM,'' said Gary Hill, president 
of Local 696. ``But we have a plan to make our plants profitable 
and that's our focus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM, which has been preparing to spin off Delphi for the past two  
years, is expected to offer up to 18 percent of Delphi in an 
initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. 
GM will distribute the rest to GM shareholders later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hopeful that it will work, but I guess it's wait and  
see,'' said Ahmad Abdul-Majid, a brake plant worker. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bad deal for people that's been working for GM all  
these years,'' said Harley Turner, another brake plant worker. He 
is concerned about whether he will be able to keep his job security 
and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi spokesman Jim Hagedon said on Sunday he could not comment  
because of the pending stock offering. 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi workers may benefit from the spinoff, said David Cole,  
director of the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of 
Automotive Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Delphi is being set free and I think you're going to see the  
company absolutely blossom in this role,'' Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi gets about 35 percent of its business from sources other  
than GM's North American operations, but hopes to increase the 
amount to half by the end of 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Delphi can no longer count on GM's business because after  
the spinoff, GM will buy parts from any supplier it chooses. 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi, based in Troy, Mich., earned $370 million on $28.5  
billion in sales last year, making brakes, shocks, struts, air 
conditioners, compressors, steering systems, air bags and other 
automotive parts for about 30 automakers worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi has 204,000 employees in 36 countries. The company  
employs 15,000 people at seven plants in the Dayton area.

<HEADLINE> Former Va. Gov. Godwin Dies at 84 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Mills E. Godwin Jr., an influential  
two-term Virginia governor who played a crucial early role in the 
state's fierce resistance to school desegregation, has died. He was 
84. 
</P>
<P>
	Godwin, elected as a Democrat in 1965 and as a Republican in  
1973, died Saturday in Newport News a few hours after his release 
from a 10-day hospital stay for treatment of pneumonia, said his 
nephew, Dr. Webb Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without question, history will assess him as one of the most  
important governors of the 20th century,'' said former Democratic 
Gov. Gerald L. Baliles, who served from 1986 to 1990. ``He was a 
political giant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Godwin was elected to the House of Delegates in 1948, moved to  
the Virginia Senate four years later, and remained there until his 
1961 election as lieutenant governor. He won his first term as 
governor in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, Godwin was a principal architect of Virginia's  
so-called ``massive resistance'' policy to school integration. At 
one point, he declared there would be ``no compromise on our 
principle of total segregation in Virginia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state abandoned massive resistance in 1959. Godwin later  
said that Virginia needed time to ``adjust to what inevitably had 
to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he admitted that ``we waited too long to do some of the  
things we should have done in earlier years to assure full equality 
of opportunity in education'' for black children. 
</P>
<P>
	Godwin's first term as governor was highlighted by the creation  
of Virginia's system of two-year community colleges and 
implementation of the state sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
	He could not seek re-election in 1969 because Virginia does not  
allow governors two consecutive terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Upset by the liberal drift of the national Democratic party, he  
was persuaded to join the GOP and ran for another term in 1973 as a 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	But Godwin's second term may be more remembered for fiscal  
problems spawned by the Arab oil embargo. He ordered spending cuts 
of more than $200 million to keep the state budget balanced. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Virginia government professor Larry Sabato said  
Godwin's accomplishments far outweigh his role in massive 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that was the low point of his career,'' Sabato said.  
``Is it a black mark? Absolutely. Does it define his career? 
Absolutely not.''

<HEADLINE> Aussie IOC Member Unfazed by Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australia's senior Olympic official  
remains unconcerned at being drawn into a U.S. investigation into 
the bribery scandal surrounding Salt Lake City's bid for the 2002 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI reportedly is examining links between 60 past and  
present IOC members and students at the University of Utah to 
discover whether any scholarships were given in return for votes. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC executive board member Kevan Gosper of Australia said Sunday  
he had no problem with any examination of his visits to Salt Lake 
City or to the university. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've asked the University of Utah if any of a number of  
people -- and there's a list of 60 and I guess it relates to those 
of us who visited Salt Lake City -- whether any of us have had any 
sort of relationship with the university,'' he said in a radio 
interview with Australian Broadcasting Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, the quick answer is of course not. These things are  
boring -- I've got no further comment and it certainly won't be a 
distraction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's other IOC member, Phil Coles, also was reported to  
be among the 60 involved in the FBI investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very distressing,'' Coles told Australian Broadcasting  
Corp. radio. ``The truth of the matter is there were 60 odd people 
that visited Salt Lake City and all 60 plus, I think it is nearly 
up to 100, these names have been presented to three universities in 
Salt Lake City to track the trail of scholarships for names of 
people who might be related to any one of us. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that's a fair line of investigation, I don't have a  
problem with that. But I do have the problem where somebody in the 
United States has seen fit to publish or release the names and that 
is extremely damaging to me and my family, it's disgusting. ``I 
feel as though I have been hit by a runaway truck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen IOC delegates already have been implicated in the Salt  
Lake City cash-for-votes scandal. Five are set to be expelled at an 
IOC meeting in March and four already have quit. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's chief investigator, Dick Pound, said Saturday more IOC  
members had been targeted in the Salt Lake scandal, which now also 
covered Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said an ``indefinite number'' of names from the 106  
committee members had been added to the inquiry since its initial 
report on Salt Lake City. He refused to identify the additions. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC investigators will travel in late February to Sydney, where  
officials will have to explain why Australian Olympic Committee 
president John Coates offered $35,000 each to the Kenyan and 
Ugandan IOC delegates the night before Sydney won the right to hold 
the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kenyan was Charles Mukora, who has resigned after being  
implicated in the Salt Lake case.

<HEADLINE> Mediate Wins Third Title in Phoenix  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Phoenix Open always provides Rocco  
Mediate with some memorable moments. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, he returned to the tour under a medical  
extension after back surgery and tied for sixth to regain full 
playing privileges. Last year, he began a streak of 13 straight 
tournaments in the money by making the cut at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rollicking and unsettling 1999 event surpassed anything  
in the 14-year veteran's experience. He not only won for the first 
time in six years with a par-71 on Sunday, but he ran afoul of two 
fans -- one who fired him up with an insult, and one who was 
carrying a handgun and heckling Tiger Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many weird things have gone on?'' Mediate said while  
pondering his 72-hole score of 11-under-par 273, good for a 
two-stroke margin over Justin Leonard. ``A poor lady had a seizure 
behind No. 10 yesterday. And this guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Playing the final two rounds with Woods didn't help, but it  
allowed Mediate to show he is recovered from 1994 surgery on the 
L,2-3 disk that kept him from getting full rotation out of his 
swing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not even near the person I was then,'' Mediate said about  
his wins at Doral in 1991 and Greensboro in 1993. ``There's not 
even any similarities as far as swing or game or mental -- I'm a 
little tougher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He went into the final round with a six-shot lead on Woods and  
seven on Leonard. Even par was just enough as Leonard carded a 66 
and Woods a 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Theirs were scorching scores on a decidedly tougher TPC of  
Scottsdale layout. Three years ago, Leonard shot 269 to tie for 
first and lost to Phil Mickelson in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure I could find a couple shots in there somewhere, but  
it just wasn't in the cards,'' Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods won seven of his first 37 tournaments, but now has gone 13  
in a row without a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I would have made a couple key putts on the front nine, it  
might have been a different story,'' said Woods, who parred the 
first 10 holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hal Sutton was fourth at 279, with Bill Glasson, who won this  
event in 1994, fifth at 280. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 13 golfers broke par, compared with 50 last year. The 1998  
scores prompted changes at the course to make it more similar to a 
U.S. Open setup. 
</P>
<P>
	Mediate won $540,000 and rose to third on the money list with  
$560,850 after two events, trailing David Duval and Jeff Sluman. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval earned $1,008,000 while winning his first two tournaments,  
but added just $40,500 after shooting his only two over-par rounds 
of the year and tying for 18th at 1-over. 
</P>
<P>
	Police identified the fan with the gun as Brian K. Murphy, 40,  
of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Doug Dirren, a spokesman for the tournament detail, said  
officer Rob Rucker found a semiautomatic pistol in Murphy's fanny 
pack. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy, who had a permit for the weapon, was booked on suspicion  
of aggravated assault and disorderly conduct after pushing Rucker, 
Dirren said. He was released on his own recognizance pending 
referral of the charges to the Maricopa County attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods and Mediate were not aware Murphy was armed until later.  
</P>
<P>
	``It might come to the point where it might be like a high  
school, where you have to have metal detectors in order to go in,'' 
Woods said. ``Especially when you have this many people doing the 
things they're doing out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mediate, who bogeyed No. 5, was finishing up the last of seven  
consecutive pars on No. 12 when he got the jolt that got him 
rolling. A fan yelled that Mediate would ``fold like a cheap suit'' 
if Woods made a birdie putt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a stupid thing to say, but it got me going a little  
bit, and I roasted it off the tee at 13. ... So that's my first 
birdie,'' Mediate said. 
</P>
<P>
	He bogeyed the next hole, but made difficult putts to save par  
on the next two holes and then two-putted for birdie from 90 feet 
away on No. 17, a 332-yard par-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods couldn't get a run going, scattering three bogeys on the  
back nine. 
</P>
<P>
	He got a huge break on 13, a 585-yard par-5, after his tee shot  
landed in front of a boulder in a natural area. 
</P>
<P>
	Rules official Orlando Pope quickly decided the obstacle fell in  
the category of a loose impediment which wasn't ``solidly 
embedded'' and therefore could be moved. 
</P>
<P>
	Spectators helped roll the half-ton boulder out of the way, and  
Woods birdied the hole.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Expect Fight Over Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With federal surpluses looming larger than  
ever, lawmakers are bracing for a yearlong tax-cut fight as 
President Clinton prepares to release a $1.77 trillion budget for 
2000 that ignores the Republican call for across-the-board 
reductions in tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's proposal, which he is sending to Congress on  
Monday, projects surpluses totaling $2.41 trillion over the decade 
ending 2009, people familiar with the package said. That is nearly 
$160 billion less than the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office 
envisions for the same period, but still a huge sum the two parties 
are already wrangling over. 
</P>
<P>
	``That makes for a pretty good fight, I think,'' Senate Budget  
Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said in a Sunday 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan also assumes the federal government will collect  
$18.9 billion from 2001 through 2004 from settlements the tobacco 
industry has reached with the states, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president wants to use the money to pay for tobacco-related  
health costs for millions of veterans, federal workers, American 
Indians and the poor. But the fate of the money is in question 
because state officials have promised to contest federal claims to 
any portion of the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget favors narrowly aimed tax breaks like $1,000  
credits for long-term health-care patients and disabled people 
trying to return to work. It would shower billions of dollars on 
the Pentagon, schools and mass transit, plus smaller amounts on 
everything from helping the mentally ill to restoring salmon 
populations in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	All his plans require congressional action, and it is unclear  
how cooperative the two sides will be considering acrimony built by 
Clinton's impeachment trial and in the run-up to the 2000 
presidential campaign. Already, Republicans are on the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question this document is the rebirth of big  
government,'' Domenici said. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Clinton's lead, both parties have agreed to set aside  
most of the surplus to shore up Social Security for the pending 
retirement of baby boomers, though they disagree how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	But while both sides also say extra money is needed for defense  
and education, Republicans want to devote hundreds of billions of 
surplus dollars to a 10 percent across-the-board reduction in 
income tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea, supported by many House and Senate Republicans alike,  
highlights how GOP lawmakers from the two chambers seem determined 
to move past internal divisions that stymied action last year on 
taxes. Domenici is looking at a plan that would gradually phase in 
the rate reductions, costing perhaps $650 billion over 10 years or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are already launching offensives against the  
Republican proposal, including their often-used argument that the 
GOP is mostly trying to help the rich. Because higher-income people 
earn more money and pay higher tax rates, a 10 percent reduction in 
all income tax rates would mean the average higher-income person 
would get a bigger dollar savings than low-income Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the last things we want is to present something that's  
more beneficial to the wealthy than it is to the working class,'' 
Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, top Democrat on the Senate 
Budget Committee, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, in documents it has distributed to Democratic  
congressional aides, the White House contrasts the GOP proposal 
with Clinton's plan to set aside $536 billion of the surplus for 
federal contributions to new investment accounts the president 
would establish to help people save for retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	These new accounts ``for working Americans ... will mean  
hundreds of dollars in tax credits -- more generous than a 10 
percent tax cut,'' the documents say pointedly. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget forecasts a $79 billion surplus in fiscal 1999,  
which runs through Sept. 30, and a $117 billion surplus in 2000, 
the sources said. The black ink would grow gradually to $393 
billion in 2009. The 1998 surplus was $70 billion, the first since 
1969 and the largest ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the massive surpluses, budget rules still limit spending  
on the one-third of the budget that covers defense and domestic 
programs, excluding automatic benefits like Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	To help pay for that spending, Clinton is proposing to lay claim  
to $18.9 billion of the $246 billion the tobacco industry is ready 
to pay to the states as a result of legal settlements. That money -- 
which is in addition to the $8 billion Clinton would raise from a 
55-cents-a-pack increase in cigarette taxes -- would not begin until 
2001 to allow time for a resolution of the expected federal-state 
dispute, the administration says. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget also proposes to:  
</P>
<P>
	--Triple to $600 million spending for after-school and summer  
school programs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Continue Clinton's plans for hiring additional teachers and  
police officers and for building schools. 
</P>
<P>
	--Spend $663 million for civil rights enforcement, 15 percent  
more than last year.

<HEADLINE> Sheriff: Disaster Drill a Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- When four people ``died'' and more than  
100 others were ``injured'' in a mock terrorist attack at Cooper 
Stadium in December, everyone knew about the drill except one very 
important person: the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Jim Karnes said the Franklin County Emergency Management  
Agency never told him about the drill, even though it took place in 
his jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	``The recent mock disaster was just that in my opinion -- a  
disaster,'' Karnes wrote in a letter sent to city and county 
officials last week. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Dec. 3 drill, 700 participants from law enforcement  
agencies, health departments and the fire department responded to a 
pretend release of a chemical blistering agent at a football game. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency management director J.R. Thomas said he apologized to  
the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
	``We run these exercises for a particular purpose, and that's to  
learn. This is one of the things we found out we missed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Karnes said that if the disaster had been real, he would have  
been in charge. The sheriff thinks he should run the emergency 
agency, a suggestion the president of the county board opposes.

<HEADLINE> Smith's Big Play Designed on the Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Denver Broncos have so much faith in their  
offense that they can design plays on the fly and turn them into 
gamebreakers. 
</P>
<P>
	That's precisely what they did on John Elway's 80-yard touchdown  
pass to Rod Smith late in the second quarter of Sunday's Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``That play wasn't even in the game plan,'' said Smith, who blew  
past safety Eugene Robinson to catch Elway's long pass, then sped 
to the end zone for the second-longest TD from scrimmage in Super 
Bowl history. ``We put it in on the sideline just before we did it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was going to be the first play out of the shoot. It didn't  
matter when we got the ball, even if they scored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons didn't score as Morten Andersen missed a 26-yard  
field goal that could have made it 10-6. With the ball at the 20, 
it was time for the drawn-up play, dubbed ``Keeper X-Post.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The coaches upstairs saw some tendencies and called the  
play,'' Smith said. ``They said, `You can get open to the post.' 
The cornerback let me go and once I was on top of (Robinson). I 
knew I would beat him and the football would be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, the game's most valuable player it what might be his  
final NFL game, sent a perfect spiral that Smith caught in stride. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith finished the game with five receptions for 152 yards, a  
far cry from last year's performance, when he didn't catch a ball. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the finest way to complete a big year in which Smith led  
Denver with 86 catches for 1,222 yards. That he didn't make the Pro 
Bowl bothered him, although he admitted to being ``very happy'' 
that partner Ed McCaffrey was voted to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the best two receivers in the league, because we are  
the champs,'' he said. ``We do what a lot of other receivers on 
others teams won't do. We're blue collar guys on a blue collar 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith used the performances of other top receivers to inspire  
him Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the game, during the week, I took out my laptop and  
looked at the stats of the top receivers in the Super Bowl,'' he 
said. ``It motivated me to try to get to that level. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been blessed the last four years of my career,'' said  
Smith, an undrafted free agent from Missouri Southern in 1994. ``I 
was on the practice squad just trying to hold onto a job, then I 
went in in third-down situations, then got to be a starter. And 
now, two Super Bowls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which means the Broncos are a dynasty, according to Smith. And  
the rest of the NFL had better recognize it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever the other teams are, they still have to kiss our  
butts,'' he said, ``because we are the champs. And they have to 
kick our butts to get this, because we are the two-time champs.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Close Marginally Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen Monday as investors  
bought back the Japanese currency to take profits on the 
greenback's recent rise. Japanese stocks fell slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.64 yen at midafternoon, down 0.34 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
116.43 yen Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 34.07 points,  
or 0.23 percent, to 14,465.18 to close day's trading. On Friday, 
the average closed up 156.93 points, or 1.09 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar fell in Tokyo after Japanese  
exporters and overseas funds bought back the yen to lock in profits 
following the U.S. currency's rise to near 116.50 yen in New York 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar surged Friday after the Commerce Department said the  
U.S. economy grew at an astounding 5.6 percent annual rate during 
the final quarter of 1998. Gross domestic product for all of last 
year increased by 3.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.14 yen at  
midafternoon, down from 132.45 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The new currency hit an intraday low Monday of 131.08 yen -- its  
weakest level since its inception on Jan. 1 -- which further weighed 
down the dollar in Tokyo, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices started higher following  
Friday's gains on Wall Street, led by a rally in technology, 
electronics and other export-oriented stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average ended up 77.50  
points, or 0.8 percent, to 9,358.83 at Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Nikkei average drifted down later in the session as  
Tokyo stocks were hit by a spate of selling sparked by sales in the 
futures market, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, investors stayed on the sidelines to await details  
of a government plan to prevent companies from dumping stocks on 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai newspaper reported Saturday that the Liberal  
Democratic Party is considering making Japan Securities Finance Co. 
buy stocks from companies that unwind cross shareholdings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unclear what will happen to stocks after Japan  
Securities Finance buys them,'' said Masatoshi Sato, manager of 
investment information at Kankaku Securities. He said investors are 
hesitant to buy on the report until more concrete details emerge. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section closed down 5.89 points, or 0.52 percent, to 
1,119.37. The TOPIX rose 15.04, or 1.35 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond rose to 2.075 percent from Friday's finish of 1.990 
percent, driving its price down to 97.84 yen from 98.49 yen.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Firm Buys Australian Gas Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Australia's Victoria state  
government has sold its Westar/Kinetik natural gas utility to 
U.S.-based Texas Utilities Co. for $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The gas utility combines the Westar gas distribution network,  
with the Kinetik Energy gas retailing business. Kinetik services 
around 396,000 customers in western Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
	Westar/Kinetik is the first of Victoria's three gas utilities to  
be sold. The remaining two distribution and retailing gas 
utilities, Multinet Gas/Ikon Energy and Stratus Networks/Energy 21, 
along with the state's major gas pipeline network, Transmission 
Pipelines Australia, are all expected to be sold before the end of 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say Victoria could raise more than $3 billion from the  
sale of the four gas assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Utilities already owns a Victorian electricity  
distribution and retailing company, Eastern Energy, and its 
acquisition of Westar/Kinetik creates the first ``multi-energy 
company with coverage across the state,'' the Victorian government 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This first sale also achieves the Victorian Government's  
vision of creating an integrated energy market,'' with retailers 
providing a variety of energy products and services, the government 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Utilities is also building an underground gas storage  
facility in the state.

<HEADLINE> Mega-Casino To Open in Las Vegas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Surfing in the desert. Bob Dylan. The Blues  
Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	They're the latest attractions headed for the Las Vegas Strip as  
the city's newest megaresort -- Mandalay Bay -- undergoes finishing 
touches in preparation for its March 2 opening. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of workers swarmed through the 43-story, $1 billion  
project Friday, laying carpet, planting tropical landscaping and 
fiddling with ornate statuary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being 31 days out, we're in pretty good shape,'' Glenn  
Schaeffer, president of parent Circus Circus Enterprises Inc., said 
as he stepped over electrical cords and wound his way through a 
maze of construction equipment. ``When the carpets are down and the 
slot lights are blinking, you're close. 
</P>
<P>
	The theme resort -- part Polynesian, Bali and Caribbean -- will be  
competing for the spotlight in the months ahead. The Venice-themed 
Venetian opens April 14, the Resort at Summerlin later in the 
spring, Paris-Las Vegas in September and the new Aladdin in the 
spring of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The new hotels come at a time when the visitor count is flat --  
at about 30.6 million annually. Resort officials are hopeful the 
new properties will boost the count, as The Mirage did in 1989, and 
Luxor, Treasure Island and MGM Grand did in late 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``The packages are nice and shiny on the outside,'' Schaeffer  
said, referring to the city's growing number of $1 billion 
hotel-casinos. ``The question is how good is the surprise on the 
inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As if to answer the question, Schaeffer pointed out the  
intricate woodworking in the hotel's 130,000-square-foot casino, a 
bar where guests will be surrounded by an acquarium featuring black 
sharks, the Rum Jungle bar where patrons walk through a wall of 
fire to enter, and elegant restaurants overlooking an 11-acre lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Championship surfing will take place on the lake, Schaeffer  
said, thanks to a machine that produces 6-foot waves. 
</P>
<P>
	Music will be a key element of the 60-acre resort on the south  
end of the Las Vegas Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	On the back side of the hotel, workers were placing seats in the  
12,000-seat Mandalay Bay Events Center. A venue for major sports 
events and superstar concerts, the center will be christened April 
10 with a concert by opera star Luciano Pavarotti. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, work continued on the 1,700-seat Mandalay Bay Theatre,  
which will feature the six-time Tony Award winning musical 
``Chicago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in the heart of the hotel, the Los Angeles-based House of  
Blues is completing a 2,000-seat theater that will feature the 
Blues Brothers -- Dan Aykroyd, Jim Belushi and John Goodman -- at a 
March 2 VIP grand opening party. Rock legend Bob Dylan will follow 
with a midnight concert. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a shopping mall of 1 million square feet is under  
construction between Mandalay Bay and Luxor, with the opening set 
for the fall of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The hotel is sold out for its opening, Schaeffer said. Included  
in the 3,700 rooms and suites will be 424 managed by Four Seasons 
Hotels and Resorts. The Four Seasons will have its own entrance, 
pool and bank of elevators to the 35th through 39th floors, which 
will be Four Seasons exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be the first time you'll have a hotel within a  
hotel,'' Schaeffer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rooms in the Four Seasons will average about $200 a night, while  
Mandalay Bay will be closer to $110. Luxor, the pyramid-shaped 
neighbor, averages $85 to $90 a night. The average room price on 
the Strip is about $80, Schaeffer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The resort will feature 15 restaurants, including Wolfgang Puck,  
the China Grill (where robots serve dim sum) and Aureole's, which 
features a wine tower four stories tall.

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed in Fla. Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUMMERFIELD, Fla. (AP) -- A small plane crashed into a house,  
killing two passengers and seriously injuring the pilot and a third 
passenger. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured inside the house, which was located on a  
small thoroughbred horse farm. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Monturiol, who lived in this town 50 miles northwest of  
Orlando, was pronounced dead after the crash Saturday. Passenger 
Ruth Hodson died Sunday of injuries suffered in the crash, hospital 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant Monturiol, the pilot and owner of the plane, was in  
critical condition Sunday night. Ronald Hodson was in serious but 
stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	It appeared that at least one of the two engines on the Aero  
Commander had sputtered before the crash, sheriff's Sgt. Brad Smith 
said. Neighbors said they saw the plane careening downward with its 
engine cutting in and out as it tried to land at a private airstrip 
a few hundred yards away.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Leader Criticizes Free Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- The free-market approach has failed to  
help the world's poor people and should be rethought, Egyptian 
President Hosni Mubarak told a global meeting of government and 
business leaders on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the emerging world there is bitter sentiment of injustice,  
a sense that there must be something wrong with a system that wipes 
out years of hard-won development'' because of market changes, 
Mubarak told an annual gathering of 1,600 prominent political, 
commercial and other figures. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was undeniable that more people suffer from poverty  
today than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our global village has caught fire. We have put out most of  
it, but there are still pockets that can threaten us all again,'' 
Mubarak said. ``The time has come for us to rethink the direction 
our planet is taking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mubarak's wasn't the only dissenting voice at the forum, which  
celebrates economic globalization. 
</P>
<P>
	American labor leader John J. Sweeney told the forum that forces  
of globalization were ``wracking the world'' with ``terrible human 
costs'' in job losses and other deprivation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our task is not to make societies safe for globalization, but  
to make the global system safe for decent societies,'' said 
Sweeney, president of the U.S. umbrella labor body, the AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the forum on Saturday, about 100 people defied a ban on  
demonstrations. They said globalization is ``the concentration of 
power and wealth in the hands of a few.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The protest was organized by the Anti-WTO Coordination, a  
coalition of groups that say the forum is dominated by ``mostly 
male'' figures whose policies result in ``exclusion, poverty and 
misery for an ever increasing number of people,'' particularly 
women. The same organization protested a summit organized by the 
World Trade Organization in Geneva last May. 
</P>
<P>
	A top International Monetary Fund official defended his  
organization Sunday against criticism that it disregards the social 
impact of its rescue plans for crisis-hit countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF's No. 2 official, Stanley Fischer said it is impossible  
to avoid shrinking economies in dealing with crises, but ``it is 
equally an illusion to imagine that the people who design these 
programs are unaware of their social consequences and do not 
care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A top official of one country suffering economic turmoil,  
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, met with Fischer on 
Sunday, hoping to pave the way to restoring a $22.6 billion aid 
package scrapped last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer said he reiterated the IMF's demand that Russia adopt  
``a strong budget'' and that the prime minister had outlined his 
new economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF has criticized the existing draft budget, passed Friday  
by Russia's parliament, as unfeasible. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia says it needs new IMF loans to help it pay off old debts  
and give other creditors confidence to renegotiate other debt 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, explaining his  
economic recovery plan, rankled at criticisms of his country's 
decision last year to impose currency controls, saying the reform 
``hasn't affected anybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reforms effectively halt offshore trading of Malaysia's  
currency, the ringgit, and place limits on taking money in and out 
of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Sunday, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat arrived and was  
expected to have a series of meetings with others attending the 
forum, looking for support for a possible Palestinian state. Arafat 
must decide soon whether to declare independence on May 4.

<HEADLINE> Golota Eyes Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Andrew Golota, the promising  
heavyweight still struggling to escape the ghosts of mistakes past, 
could find himself fighting someone with even more of them if 
promoter Dino Duva has his way. 
</P>
<P>
	No sooner had Golota dispatched of Jesse Ferguson on Saturday  
than Duva was talking about a Golota fight with Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	Think of the promotional possibilities: Tyson, the volatile  
ear-biter who was banned from boxing for a year, against Golota, 
the low-blow specialist who was twice disqualified in 1996 bouts 
against Riddick Bowe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone acknowledges that would be a tremendous promotion,''  
said Duva, who hopes to make a Tyson-Golota fight by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Golota looked crisp and in control in posting a  
unanimous 10-round decision over Ferguson. Though he never knocked 
down Ferguson, Golota (33-3) dominated with strong left jabs and 
punishing overhand rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson, 41, was a late substitute for Jimmy Thunder, who tore  
an Achilles tendon in training and withdrew Wednesday. Ferguson 
signed for the fight Thursday, salvaging the card headlined by 
unbeaten heavyweight Michael Grant. 
</P>
<P>
	When he entered the ring before 2,724 fans in the Convention  
Hall ballroom, the ``Mission: Impossible'' theme boomed from 
loudspeakers. 
</P>
<P>
	It soon became apparent that for Ferguson, it would be. Ferguson  
(26-18) fought gamely but never seriously challenged Golota nor 
landed any big punches. 
</P>
<P>
	The same could be said about Grant's opponent, Ahmad Abdin, who  
was stopped after 10 rounds of a scheduled 12-rounder against the 
IBC champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, a 6-foot-7, 250-pounder with 28 victories, was fighting  
for the first time in nine months. His previous scheduled bout was 
canceled after he came down with hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
	But his long reach kept Abdin, a former sparring partner, from  
getting close enough to do much damage. And Grant kept the pressure 
on, wearing down Abdin with left jabs. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, of Norristown, Pa., knocked Abdin down with a vicious  
right to the body at the end of the ninth round. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 10th, Grant nailed a charging Abdin with an overhand  
right that dropped him again. Later in the round, he knocked down 
Abdin a third time with a left. Abdin got up at eight, after the 
bell. 
</P>
<P>
	But referee Eddie Cotton, acting on the advice of ringside  
physician Dr. Kenneth Remsen, stopped the fight after the 10th. 
``He was disoriented,'' Remsen said. ``His eyes were rolled up. He 
had a blank stare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdin, of Houston, dropped to 25-2-3.  
</P>
<P>
	Grant said he had no preference about who he would fight next.  
When asked about Golota, he said: ``I think nothing of Andrew 
Golota. He has his own destiny and it's in his hands. I'll leave it 
up to (manager) Don Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't turned anyone down,'' Grant said. ``We'll fight  
anyone. We'll fight nine gorillas.''

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Tourism Fell 2 Pct. in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- The head count for Hawaii's top industry --  
tourism -- fell 1.9 percent last year to 6.7 million, the first 
annual decline since 1993, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials for the state and the Hawaii Visitors &AMP; and  
Convention Bureau said Friday that the drop was offset by longer 
stays in the islands. 
</P>
<P>
	The continuing Asian economic crisis led to a 10.8 percent  
decrease in arrivals from the Asia-Pacific region. But the nearly 
2.5 million people who did come increased their overall length of 
stay by 3.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Economic troubles in the Asia region plagued Hawaii's  
eastbound markets throughout the year,'' said Seiji Naya, director 
of the state Department of Business, Economic Development and 
Tourism. 
</P>
<P>
	``The past year was truly challenging for those Hawaii hotels,  
retailers, airlines, restaurants, attractions that focus primarily 
on the Asian visitor market as a considerable segment of their 
business,'' said Tony Vericella, the visitors bureau president and 
chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the number of westbound visitors increased 4.1  
percent to 4.2 million over 1997, and their length of stay inched 
up 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Vericella said hopes are high that 1999 will prove better than  
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time, the general consensus is that the Asia-Pacific  
market will perform better this year than it did last year, and we 
are working closely with the Hawaii Tourism Authority and our other 
industry partners to aggressively keep Hawaii at the top of mind of 
outbound Asia-Pacific travelers,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Schenk Wins WBO Middleweight Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COTTBUSS, Germany (AP) -- Bert Schenk of Germany knocked out  
Freemann Barr with 37 seconds left in the fourth round Saturday to 
gain the vacant WBO middleweight title. 
</P>
<P>
	Schenk, the first middleweight champion in history from his  
country, followed a left cross with a hard shot to the body that 
dropped the Bahamas-born Barr. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr, was turned around by the blows, then walked away and sunk  
to his knees in a neutral corner. Schenk improved to 22-0 with 12 
knockouts while Barr fell to 18-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The superior punching power of Schenk proved decisive in a close  
fight. He snapped the American's head back with the left cross at 
the end of both the first and third rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first step in showing that I can mix it up with  
the best in the world,'' said Schenk, 28. ``I landed some clean 
blows and they had their effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The title had been vacant since American Otis Grant gave it up  
last year in order to challenge light heavyweight champion Roy 
Jones Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Schenk had been regarded in Germany as a talented but lazy  
fighter. As an amateur, he twice defeated Cuba's highly regarded 
Olympic champion Ariel Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-handed Barr confused Schenk early in the fight by  
constantly switching to a southpaw style, but he couldn't hurt the 
German with his punches. 
</P>
<P>
	Schenk became the fifth world champion fighting in Germany, all  
for Hamburg's Universum Box Promotion. He was the first German to 
fight for a middleweight title in 59 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Schenk weighed 158 pounds while Barr was 157.

<HEADLINE> A Bumper Crop of Stock Splits / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Take one look at the recent barrage of  
stock-split announcements from corporate America, and you know 
there's a bull market raging on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	In one three-day stretch last week, four of the business world's  
biggest names -- Microsoft, IBM, Xerox and McDonald's -- announced 
plans for 2-for-1 splits, and two star players in the Internet 
game, America Online and eBay, also said they would split 2 for 1. 
</P>
<P>
	This has been going on for some time now. As tallied by Standard  
&AMP; Poor's Corp., the number of stock splits of 3-for-2 or greater by 
New York Stock Exchange companies set a record of 235 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, even with the big selloff that hit the stock market  
between July and October, the total came to 224. And as of midweek 
last week, the January 1999 tally had already reached 35. 
</P>
<P>
	Splits can play a big part in the excitement of a flourishing  
market. But they can also confuse and mislead anyone who doesn't 
have a clear idea of what splits do, and do not, represent. 
</P>
<P>
	The first point to understand is that a split creates nothing in  
the way of new value or wealth. It merely cuts an existing pie into 
a greater number of pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	Suppose you own 100 shares of Hypothetical Industries, trading  
at around $80 a share, when Hypothetical declares a 2-for-1 split. 
You will receive another 100 shares, bringing your total to 200, 
but the stock will start trading at around $40 after the split. So 
your investment will still have the same total value, around 
$8,000. 
</P>
<P>
	What's the big deal, then? A quick Internet search turns up a  
dozen names of companies that study, track and predict stock 
splits, many of them offering to notify investors by pager or 
e-mail every time a new split is announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Splits, by long-standing tradition, are considered signals of  
confidence from the companies that declare them, and significant 
psychological boosts for the stocks involved. They are often 
accompanied by other bullish news from the same company, including 
perhaps an increase in the cash dividend. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, when Walgreen, the drug and general merchandise  
retailer, recently announced plans for a 2-for-1 split that is 
payable on Feb. 12, it also raised the cash dividend more than 8 
percent and said it plans to more than double the number of stores 
it operates by the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's, which will split 2-for-1 on March 5, accompanied  
that news last week with a dividend increase and one of its 
strongest quarterly earnings reports in quite a while. 
</P>
<P>
	In contexts like this, declarations of splits seem to serve as a  
kind of explanation point, emphasizing management's and directors' 
optimism about the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Wall Streeters also like the math of stock splits because  
they serve to keep a round lot of 100 shares reasonably affordable 
for individual investors. Hypothetical's 2-for-1 split described 
above, for instance, effectively means that the minimum ante to buy 
its shares in round lots is reduced from $8,000 to $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors prefer to deal in multiples of 100 shares, rather  
than so-called odd lots, because they can usually get more 
favorable prices that way when they buy and sell. 
</P>
<P>
	It also has to be said that splits can serve an important  
psychological purpose by making stocks seem less forbidding to buy 
after they have enjoyed a big runup. If you remembered a time when 
Hypothetical used to trade around $10 a share, you might be 
reluctant to buy it for $80. 
</P>
<P>
	But after a split, with the shares knocked down in price to $40,  
it's easier for a would-be buyer not to be so mindful of the fact 
that the stock has already had a 700 percent move.

<HEADLINE> Kafelnikov No One-Slam Wonder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Yevgeny Kafelnikov scrambled and  
grunted, sliced and counterpunched, waited and pounced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I broke Thomas mentally,'' Kafelnikov said after watching one  
last error by the hard-hitting Thomas Enqvist -- a double fault on 
match point -- and collecting his second Grand Slam tournament 
trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	With the 4-6, 6-0, 6-3, 7-6 (7-1) Australian Open victory,  
Kafelnikov erased the ``one-slam wonder'' tag that had been 
attached to him when he reached only one quarterfinal in the seven 
Grand Slam tournaments following his French Open victory in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely proved it wrong by winning another one,'' the  
24-year-old Russian said. ``If I would win another French Open, it 
also feels great; but to win a different one, the Australian Open, 
it feels a lot better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also came five months after Kafelnikov had given up hope of  
winning a second major title, saying, ``It's way beyond my 
ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he raised the trophy, he thanked No. 1 Pete Sampras for  
staying home because of fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever Pete is in the tournament, you feel like he's  
definitely the man to win,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras wasn't the only top player who wasn't in Kafelnikov's  
path to the title. No. 2 Marcelo Rios withdrew with a back injury 
on the eve of the first round. No. 5 Andre Agassi couldn't lift his 
game when it counted, and Enqvist knocked out U.S. Open champion 
Patrick Rafter and runner-up Mark Philippoussis. 
</P>
<P>
	By the semifinals, No. 10 Kafelnikov was the only seeded player  
left in the men's singles. 
</P>
<P>
	He called himself the underdog to the 21st-ranked Enqvist, who  
came into the final on a 14-match winning streak, but thought he 
had detected a tendency by the 24-year-old Swede to choke at key 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was not too nice to say,'' said Enqvist, adding, ``I  
usually play pretty good under pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also disagreed that he had been broken mentally, although he  
lost nine games in a row starting in the second set, started the 
decisive tiebreaker with five straight errors and double faulted 
twice on his last three serves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like I was in control a little bit in the beginning. I  
felt I was playing well enough to have a chance to win, and there 
were small things today which decided who was winning,'' said 
Enqvist, who still will rise to 11th in the rankings for reaching 
the title match. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the first set, I was hitting them just outside the lines  
all the time, and in the tape, and it was not enough,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov ran down many of Enqvist's better shots, punctuating  
his own strokes with grunts that reflected each one's different 
degree of difficulty. When chances occurred, he pounded winners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like Thomas had something still in his body that he  
could have tried probably a lot harder,'' Kafelnikov said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov now will rise to No. 3 in the rankings, matching his  
previous best, which he reached in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov missed last year's Australian Open after he hurt his  
left knee in a skiing accident a few weeks earlier. He had to skip 
the year's first Grand Slam tournament in 1997 because of a 
fractured finger suffered in a gym workout. 
</P>
<P>
	Before this one, his mental outlook was lifted by his daughter's  
birth in October, his wife's encouragement to push his game to a 
higher level, and new coach Larry Stefanki's insistence that he 
could again win a major tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Martina Hingis showed why Australia is her favorite Grand Slam  
tournament after losing in the semifinals of 1998's last three 
major events. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old Swiss player's 6-2, 6-3 victory over powerful  
newcomer Amelie Mauresmo of France gave her a third consecutive 
Australian Open title, and her fifth Grand Slam tournament singles 
title out of the 17 she has entered, starting at age 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old Mauresmo, the world junior champion of 1996,  
moved up the rankings from 109th to 29th last year, and reached her 
first Grand Slam tournament final here by upsetting top seed 
Lindsay Davenport with heavy hitting. But Hingis countered with 
more variety, excellent anticipation and some spectacular 
retrieving.

<HEADLINE> John Elway Named Super Bowl MVP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- There were times Sunday when John Elway was a  
jumble of emotions, elated with winning another Super Bowl, 
saddened by the possibility that this could be his last game. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway added another exclamation point to his Hall of Fame  
career, joining Bart Starr, Bob Griese, Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana 
and Troy Aikman as the only quarterbacks to win consecutive Super 
Bowls. At age 38, he is also the oldest to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	That makes the future questionable.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thrilled to death we won this game,'' Elway said. ``I'm  
going to enjoy this win for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And retirement?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to talk about that now,'' he said. ``I'll cross  
that bridge later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was speculation a year ago that Elway would retire after  
winning the Super Bowl, but he instead chose to defend the title. 
Now there is the temptation to try and become the first quarterback 
to win three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	And don't think the challenge doesn't appeal to him, especially  
after passing for 336 yards and tying the record for the second 
longest TD in Super Bowl history, an 80-yard hookup with Rod Smith, 
as Denver beat Atlanta 34-19. 
</P>
<P>
	``This definitely throws a kink in it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Elway also scored a TD on a 3-yard keeper, his fourth career  
rushing touchdown in the Super Bowl, and was 18-for-29 passing for 
the third highest yardage total in Super Bowl history. 
</P>
<P>
	Not bad for an old guy.  
</P>
<P>
	In the final minute, he was lifted and trotted to the sideline,  
helmet held high and tears in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``That walk I'll remember for the rest of my life,'' he said.  
``I got emotional a couple of times. It ended up helping me in the 
long run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway blistered the Atlanta Falcons over and over again,  
completing passes to a half-dozen different receivers and picking 
apart one of the best defenses in the NFL. He beat them short and 
beat them long, and did it without one of his chief weapons, tight 
end Shannon Sharpe, who missed most of the game with a twisted left 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway never missed a beat. He knew before the game that  
Atlanta's defense would zero in on 2,000-yard rusher Terrell Davis. 
``Everybody talked about the running game all week,'' he said. 
``Anybody can stop the run if they put enough guys up on the line. 
I went in knowing I'd have the opportunity to throw the football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means the Falcons dared Elway to beat him. And that's what  
he did. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking forward to the opportunity,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Denver's win over Green Bay went down to the final  
play. This time, Denver was in control at the end, and Elway 
enjoyed that. 
</P>
<P>
	``To do this two years in a row is unbelievable,'' he said. ``It  
definitely hit my heart because it was a great thrill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he ran a lap around Mile High Stadium after the Broncos won  
the AFC championship two weeks ago, some considered it a farewell 
to the home fans. Not even Elway is sure, though. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought about it last year,'' he said before the game. ``It  
would always be nice to go out on top and be able to walk away from 
this game winning the Super Bowl. That was one of the thoughts that 
I entertained last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He put it aside, though.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the thrill of winning the game is really hard to walk  
away from,'' he said. ``I have to cross that bridge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's championship might have been more difficult to  
achieve than last year's. There was the summertime illness of his 
wife, Janet, who underwent colon surgery. Then there were nagging 
injuries that cost him four games at a time when he said, ``I don't 
have that many games left.'' And finally, there was the 
week-by-week pressure of Denver's 13-game winning streak, a run at 
the second perfect season in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	Still he reached significant plateaus during the season -- over  
50,000 yards and 300 touchowns and the 47th fourth-quarter comeback 
of his career. And he capped it all off by beating his longtime 
coach, Dan Reeves, with whom he had a messy feud and split six 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The health of his wife was an overriding issue in Elway's  
decision to return this season. ``She wanted me to play another 
year and I think, deep down, I did, too,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All football players physically eventually run out of gas. I  
don't think you ever want to stop playing, and I think that's the 
biggest thing. Ever since I've been alive, Saturdays and Sundays in 
the fall have always been circled around a football game. The 
question of the unknown and how I'm going to react is definitely a 
scary thing and I'm sure there are a lot of things I'm going to 
miss. I don't want to leave too early, and I don't want to leave 
too late, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That hardly sounded like a man who had made up his mind.  
</P>
<P>
	Elway said retirement would be a family decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll sit down and talk about it,'' he said. ``Sometimes you  
run out of physical ability before you run out of mental desire. If 
you run out of mental desire before you run out of phyical 
attributes, then it makes it a little easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither quality was missing Sunday, and that's why the Broncos  
have another Super Bowl trophy.

<HEADLINE> China To Split State Airplane Maker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China plans to split its state-run airplane maker  
into two companies to inject competition into the tightly 
controlled industry, the official China Daily reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A blueprint for the breakup of Aviation Industries of China, or  
Avic, has been submitted to the Cabinet and follows similar 
restructuring in the oil and chemical industries, China Daily said 
in its Business Weekly editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies to emerge from Avic will make both commercial  
and military aircraft and other products, the newspaper said. It 
added that Avic's administrative functions will be handed over to a 
government commission that oversees defense-related industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders believe developing advanced aerospace industries  
able to withstand global competition are crucial to making China a 
world economic and political force. 
</P>
<P>
	China Daily gave no timetable for the breakup and cited unnamed  
analysts as concerned over layoffs of unneeded workers and the 
division of Avic's money-losing units. 
</P>
<P>
	Avic oversees 100 enterprises, 30 research centers and seven key  
government laboratories and employs 500,000 people, even after 
laying off 34,000 people last year, China Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	Avic industries have produced 15,000 military and civilian  
aircraft of 27 models and 54,000 airplane engines and last year 
conducted $1.8 billion in foreign trade, an 11 percent increase 
from 1997, China Daily said. It did not release figures on profits, 
losses or revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	In trying to revive the inefficient, debt-ridden state sector,  
Chinese leaders over the past year have sought to introduce 
competition by restructuring powerful monopolies once protected by 
central planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year the government reshuffled companies under the  
state-owned oil company and petrochemical refinery to create two 
vertically integrated oil producing and refining groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans to break up the telecommunications monopoly, China  
Telecom, are also being studied.

<HEADLINE> Boxer Still in Critical Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A boxer remained in critical condition Sunday  
with a brain injury after being knocked out by the IBF's No. 1 
junior flyweight contender. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no change overnight in the condition of Fernando  
Ibarra of Laredo, Texas, said Susan Hakes, spokeswoman for Saint 
Louis University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibarra had a blood clot on his brain after being knocked out by  
Ratanachai Vorapin of Thailand in the sixth round of a scheduled 
eight-rounder Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said Saturday that it probably would be several days  
before they could determine the extent of Ibarra's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibarra collapsed after taking a punch to the jaw. He was  
conscious and walked to the dressing room, but later lost 
consciousness. He was revived by a doctor at the scene and taken to 
the hospital.

<HEADLINE> US, India Complete Nuclear Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Indian and American negotiators ended  
their eighth round of talks Sunday aimed at persuading India to 
join a nuclear weapons treaty. No breakthroughs were announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides promised to meet again before the middle of the  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had a very fruitful, productive and constructive three  
days of discussion,'' Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh told 
journalists in New Delhi after talks with U.S. Deputy Secretary of 
State Strobe Talbott. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks began after India set off underground nuclear tests in  
the deserts of Rajasthan state in May. Neighbor Pakistan then 
conducted its own tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and other countries imposed economic and  
military sanctions on both nations and opened talks to persuade 
India to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	India refuses to sign the treaty, which bans all nuclear tests,  
saying it needs a defense against the threat it sees from China and 
Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint statement issued at the end of the talks said both sides  
were ``satisfied'' with the talks, during which they examined 
``proposals for harmonizing'' their views on security. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agreed to consult each other frequently on the status  
of negotiations on the Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty and the 
possibility of other multilateral agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington wants India and Pakistan to issue a formal moratorium  
on the production of fissile material used to make nuclear weapons 
and adopt restraints on nuclear-capable missiles and aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott said that he shared Singh's ``sense of satisfaction''  
over the latest round of talks.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Eugene Robinson Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Atlanta Falcons safety Eugene Robinson was arrested  
on a sex solicitation charge Saturday night less than 24 hours 
before the start of the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, 36, was arrested at 9 p.m. EST and charged with  
soliciting an undercover police officer for oral sex on Biscayne 
Boulevard, a busy street frequented by prostitutes and drug 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did arrest a Falcon player this evening, Eugene Robinson,  
for soliciting prostitution from one of our undercover officers,'' 
police spokesman Angel Calzadilla said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was driving a car when he offered the officer $40 for  
oral sex, Calzadilla said. He was alone at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was released from Miami Police headquarters around 11  
p.m. to a Falcons team official. He promised to return for a court 
appearance, which is usually scheduled within 21 to 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Reached in his hotel room early Sunday, Falcons general manager  
Harold Richardson said: ``I've been asleep. I'll have to check on 
it in the morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Robinson lounged by the pool at the team's  
hotel with his wife, Gia, and their 9-year-old son, Brandon. The 
couple also has an 11-year-old daughter, Brittany. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who played in the last two Super Bowls with Green Bay,  
is the NFL's career active leader in interceptions with 53. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed with the Falcons as a free agent after the Packers  
decided to go with a younger player at his position. Robinson 
became the unquestioned leader of the Falcons' secondary, earning 
Pro Bowl honors, and talked frequently about his strong religious 
faith.

<HEADLINE> Map Is Key Issue in Cable Car Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A flawed map that failed to show ski  
gondola towers stretching 500 feet above an alpine valley may be 
the central issue at the court-martial of a Marine pilot charged 
with killing 20 people when his plane's wing severed a gondola 
cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby's defense team says he never would have  
flown his EA-6B Prowler jet into the valley near Cavalese, Italy, 
if he had known about the ski lift. But his map didn't show the 
cable system, built in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	``Air crews rely on maps given to them by the United States to  
plan their mission,'' said Frank Spinner, a civilian lawyer hired 
to assist Ashby's military attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have an uncharted obstruction that goes 500 feet  
above ground level smack in the middle of an approved low-altitude 
route, how could you expect them to know that it exists?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecution lawyers acknowledge Ashby's map did not show the  
Mount Cermis ski lift but say the omission does not bear on the 
fact that Ashby was ``flathatting,'' flying too low and too fast. 
Ashby denies it. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys plan to question the 15 military jurors Thursday and  
Friday in a squat brick building on this sprawling Marine Corps 
base. Opening statements are planned Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The tragedy itself, in which a giant cable car plummeted more  
than 350 feet, tossing dismembered bodies onto blood-stained snow, 
will be fresh in many minds when the court-martial begins. A 
memorial service is planned in Italy on Wednesday, the first 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., faces a possible 200-year  
sentence if convicted of 20 involuntary manslaughter counts. He 
also is charged with destroying government and private property and 
dereliction of duty. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury,  
N.Y., faces court-martial Feb. 22 on 20 counts each of involuntary 
manslaughter and negligent homicide. Charges were dismissed last 
year against two other crew members who were seated in the rear and 
had obstructed views of the plane's path. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the bad map, Ashby's lawyers plan to show the pilot may  
have succumbed to an optical illusion that tricked him into 
thinking he was flying higher than he was. A crash investigator 
said he experienced the same illusion in a simulator: When he 
``flew'' out of the narrow valley into the wider area where the 
lift was, he said ground appeared -- incorrectly -- to be falling 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Another issue will be whether the jet's radalt -- radar altimeter  
-- properly signaled whenever the jet dropped below 1,000 feet, its 
prescribed minimum altitude. The cables were 370 feet above the 
ground where the wing hit them. 
</P>
<P>
	Spinner said the radalt checked out on the ground, and a crew  
member said he heard it before the accident. The altimeter's tone 
had sounded frequently during the ridge-hopping flight, Spinner 
said, and the pilot may have not noticed it after awhile. 
</P>
<P>
	Spinner, a former Air Force prosecutor who as a civilian  
represented Air Force Lt. Kelly Flinn in her adultery case, said 
the case would rely heavily on expert testimony. Each side plans to 
produce eight to 10 experts. 
</P>
<P>
	While the personal stakes are great for Ashby, foreign relations  
are at stake for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, when the Italian government threatened U.S. landing  
privileges at the Aviano air base, President Clinton assured the 
Italians justice would be served. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuseppe Pontrelli, spokesman for a Cavalese residents  
association, accused the United States of trying to minimize the 
accident. Last week, he said the trial should have been held in 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the two backseat crewmen have been cleared of  
charges tells you a lot about the way the U.S. is handling the 
case,'' Pontrelli said. ``If I said I'm confident about the outcome 
of the trial, it would be a lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, jurors will be taken 60 miles to the Cherry  
Point Marine Corps Air Station. That's home base for the Prowler, 
which is designed to fly at 20,000 feet and use its radar to find 
enemy planes and missiles and warn fighters and bombers. There 
jurors will observe a Prowler in the air and sit in another's 
cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of the five Belgian victims plan to attend the trial,  
at the Marine Corps' invitation, said their lawyer, Torrence 
Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the case is resolved, the victims' families still face a  
fight for damage payments from the U.S. government, Armstrong said. 
They are bewildered that the United States paid to rebuild the ski 
lift -- it reopened Jan. 23 -- and help Italian businesses, but has 
ignored them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a very significant emotional undertaking for them  
to agree to come witness the trial,'' he said. ``To see for the 
first time the pilot and crew who did this ... to relive the 
emotions of the tragedy over and over again every day as they sit 
through the evidence.''

<HEADLINE> Toyota May Supply DaimlerChrysler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Toyota Motor Corp. plans to supply DaimlerChrysler  
AG and Volkswagen AG with environmentally friendly engine 
technology with hopes to make it a global standard, according to 
published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology can purify at least 60 percent of the nitrogen  
oxide contained in exhaust from gasoline engines, Japan's economic 
newspaper Nihon Keizai reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the technology contains a catalyst system to purify  
nitrogen oxide and uses software to enhance the system's 
efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota, Japan's largest automaker, has already reached an  
agreement with DaimlerChrysler, Nihon Keizai said. It said 
Volkswagen president Ferdinand Piech also asked Toyota to provide 
the technology during his visit here early January. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota wants to make its technology a global standard and reduce  
the cost of developing fuel-efficient engines while earning 
commissions from technology transfer, Nihon Keizai said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of tightening exhaust regulations, global automakers are  
competing to develop leaner burning engines. The fuel-efficient 
engines can reduce carbon dioxide emissions but produce more 
nitrogen oxide when drivers accelerate or travel at high speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	The European automobile industry agreed last summer to reduce  
new car carbon dioxide emissions by 25 percent by 2008 from 1995 
levels.

<HEADLINE> Wonder Ignites Super Bowl Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The producers of the Super Bowl halftime show  
promised a few surprises for Sunday. But Stevie Wonder tap dancing? 
</P>
<P>
	Believe it.  
</P>
<P>
	The multitalented singer and songwriter, blind since birth,  
nonetheless got up from his keyboard and tapped out a quick dozen 
or so beats to cap his performance of ``I Wish'' midway through the 
high-energy show. 
</P>
<P>
	Wonder joined Gloria Estefan and the hot swing band Big Bad  
Voodoo Daddy for the 11-minute extravaganza titled ``Soul, Salsa 
and Swing.'' Broadway hoofer Savion Glover, who co-starred in the 
1989 movie ``Tap,'' joined the performance as a special guest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Super Bowl halftime annually is the most-watched live  
performance in music, with some 75,000 in attendance at Pro Player 
Stadium and another 800 million watching on televisions in 180 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The performance also featured more than 1,000 other performers,  
including swing dancers on stilts, huge lighted balloon balls, 
lasers and enough pyrotechnics to keep the sky above Pro Player 
Stadium well-lighted. 
</P>
<P>
	Wonder entered the field in a vintage car, singing his hit ``You  
Can Feel it All Over'' as two women helped him up the stairs to the 
huge 5,000 square-foot stage. 
</P>
<P>
	He then settled behind the keyboard to begin ``You Are the  
Sunshine of My Life,'' as dancers pulled out huge swaths of cloth 
to form the image of a sun on the field. Glover joined the jam when 
the music segued into ``I Wish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estefan, performing in front of her hometown fans, took over to  
sing segments of ``Oye'' and ``Turn the Beat Around'' as brightly 
colored dancers swung long lighted ropes. 
</P>
<P>
	Estefan became the second artist to perform in two Super Bowl  
halftime shows, joining jazz clarinetist Pete Fountain. She also 
performed in the 1992 show in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The show opened with Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, only two years  
removed from playing Hollywood's underground club scene. They 
played their arrangement ``Go Daddy-O'' before serving as 
accompaniment to Wonder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Super Bowl pregame show featured the rock band KISS, which  
did its best to live up to its pregame promise to bring down all 
low-flying aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Huge flames shot more than 30 feet in the air as they launched  
into their hit ``Rock and Roll All Night,'' with fans sitting 
behind the west end zone feeling the heat all the way to the upper 
deck. Fireworks shot from ground level all the way to the top of 
the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Cher, dressed conservatively in jeans and a beaded lavender  
blouse, performed a soulful rendition of the national anthem. The 
Miami group Speaking Hands accompanied her in sign language, and 
the U.S. Air Force 53rd Fighter Squadron roared above in a 
``missing-man'' formation, with one plane absent from the left 
side.

<HEADLINE> Marathon Planned in Antarctica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rush McCloy hopes Vermont isn't much different  
from Antarctica. He has run in Vermont and is about to try 
Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's summer in the Southern Hemisphere; the temperatures are  
10 to 15 degrees,'' said McCloy, a 24-year-old analyst with Chase 
Securities in New York City. ``In Vermont, it was 10 to 15 degrees. 
The temperatures were fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCloy and two friends will join about 130 other adventurers in  
the 3rd Antarctica Marathon &AMP; Half Marathon Feb. 13. The trip and 
the race are organized by Marathon Tours, a Boston travel agency 
that specializes in runners. Although McCloy and his friends are 
running to raise research funds for Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer 
Center in New York City, the others are in it for the pure 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Running the marathon now is commonplace,'' said Marathon  
Tours' owner, Thom Gilligan. ``In the '70s, it was the talk of the 
cocktail circuit. Now people want to do something off the beaten 
track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's hard to get farther off the beaten track than the end of  
the continent of South America -- after which, the trouble starts. 
</P>
<P>
	From Ushuaia, Argentina, the world's southernmost city, the  
runners board two former Soviet research vessels for a two-day 
voyage across the Drake Passage, whose 30-foot seas make it one of 
the world's roughest bodies of water. Seasickness is not unheard 
of. ``We are rocking and rolling,'' Gilligan said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a couple of days for recovery and sightseeing among the  
ice floes and penguins, participants will set out across a race 
course that includes crossing a boulder field, a seal cove, a 
glacial stream and a glacier. All must finish the 26.2 miles in 
under 6 hours, 30 minutes. Those who don't finish the half marathon 
in 3 hours, 10 minutes are disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
	Sound rugged? ``People didn't go to Antarctica to have a walk in  
the sunshine,'' Gilligan said. Weather can turn very nasty; the 
last race was marked by a blizzard, and ``once you start climbing 
up a glacier in 40-mile-an-hour winds blowing against you, it takes 
the romance out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just the same, it shouldn't be scary, Gilligan added. For  
instance, the crevasses in the glacier should be easy to spot -- 
even easy to climb out of, if a runner falls in. 
</P>
<P>
	And good preparation always reduces the risk. McCloy has been  
training for five months, using the New York City Marathon as a 
warmup for the Antarctic expedition. In November, he and his 
friends Basil Seggos and J.J. Hill-Wood began running on snowmobile 
trails in the mountains of Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermont is as close as they could get to Antarctica and still be  
within commuting distance of New York City, where they have jobs, 
McCloy said. As for the boulders, crevasses and glaciers, they'll 
have to adjust to those after they arrive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would tell them to keep their eye on the weather,''  
commented Andrew Young, a research physiologist at the U.S. Army 
Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, Natick, Mass. ``You 
can get on a Web site and check it out. My guess is, yes, it's cold 
-- but it's probably like wintertime here in Boston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the marathoners run hard, they will generate so much body  
heat that ``they won't experience any body cooling even if the 
temperature is as low as minus 20 degrees,'' said Young, who 
specializes in the effects of cold on soldiers. But if it gets to 
minus 30, the race should be called off, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The runners plan to dress for the weather, with thick thermal  
Spandex clothing under an outer shell, Gore-Tex running shoes, 
double-lined socks, gloves, headgear -- and sunglasses for 
protection against the wind. ``The scariest thing is lung freeze,'' 
McCloy said. ``When it gets too cold, I wear a mask around my face 
that warms the air slightly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Runners may also have to look out for each other, especially if  
they see signs of hypothermia, McCloy said. ``In this race, you are 
not out for your personal best,'' he said. ``If you see someone 
fallen, you help them to safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And race organizers need to do the same, especially right after  
the marathon, Young said. Runners will end the race sweaty and 
exhausted. The exhaustion could weaken their ability to raise body 
heat through the repeated muscle contractions of shivering or 
reduce heat loss by tightening the blood vessels in the skin, he 
said.

<HEADLINE> American Roark Wins Second Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACKCOMB, British Columbia (AP) -- American Michelle Roark won  
her second World Cup moguls contest in 24 hours Sunday, ignoring 
steady snow to capture a dual moguls event and complete a sweep of 
both ends of the Westroc World Freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympian Alex Wilson of Buffalo, N.Y., was disqualified in the  
final round when he completed a front flip off the top jump on the 
men's course. 
</P>
<P>
	Moguls regulations prohibit front flips in competition but  
Wilson, who stumbled high on the course, appeared to think his duel 
with Frenchman Thony Hemery was over when he did his flip. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials, citing the ban on front flips, disqualified him and  
awarded Hemery the victory. Canadian Dominick Gauthier, who had 
been beaten in the semifinals, moved up to second place. 
</P>
<P>
	Janne Lahtela of Finland, who won the singles event Saturday,  
moved up to third and fourth place was left empty. 
</P>
<P>
	Roark, who won her first World Cup Saturday, defeated teammate  
Brooke Ballachey of South Lake Tahoe, Calif., in the side-by-side 
bumps competition. Sylvia Kerfoot of Canada was third in the steady 
snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``It definitely was hard to see, typical blizzard conditions,''  
Roark said. ``I was so tired after (Saturday) but I said I have to 
buckle down. I still can't believe this ... but when my feet get 
back on the ground, I'll be fine.''

<HEADLINE> Senators Seem Chummy During Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Tom Daschle does the double pat. Sen.  
Strom Thurmond uses the arm clutch. Sen. Joe Biden Jr. favors the 
friendly shoulder hug. It's congressional collegiality, 
Senate-style. 
</P>
<P>
	With President Clinton's impeachment trial consuming hours of  
television time, it's hard not to notice how much the senators 
touch each other -- a handshake here, a hand on a cuff there, a 
finger on a tie. It's about political discourse, statesmanship, the 
power of persuasion. 
</P>
<P>
	There's an air of familiarity in the 100-member Senate that's  
not so pronounced in the 435-member House. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate is more interpersonal, more of a club. It really  
is,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who joined the Senate this 
month after nearly two decades in the House. There's backslapping 
in the House, too, Schumer said, but ``more of it between people of 
different parties in the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One expert in nonverbal communication thinks the impeachment  
trial has made senators even chummier. They feel isolated and worry 
they're neglecting the nation's other business, said Ernst Beier, 
retired psychology professor from the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``They know the public is not behind them. I think that's  
precisely why they're touching more,'' he says. ``By supporting 
each other, they feel less lonely, less guilty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment trial itself began with a hearty senatorial  
greeting when Thurmond gripped Chief Justice William Rehnquist's 
hand, then his arm and exclaimed in a folksy South Carolina drawl: 
``Pleased to welcome ya.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, as Senate debate droned on, Biden, a Democrat from  
Delaware, plopped down next to Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., and 
draped his left arm around Wellstone's shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	Biden leaned in close, whispered something that made Wellstone  
nod up and down. Biden playfully jabbed Wellstone's leg with a 
rolled up piece of paper. As Biden got up to leave, Wellstone 
grabbed his hand. They parted with smiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The physical contact picked up during a recess.  
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott stood with his arm around the  
shoulders of Minority Leader Tom Daschle and gently poked two 
fingers at his tie as they chatted. When the conversation ended, 
they joined hands in the air like they'd just scored a goal. As he 
walked away, Lott gave Daschle a one-two pat on the arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., a lawyer, said the Senate is  
no more hands-on than any other group he's worked with. 
Politicians, by nature, are glad-handers, he said. ``I haven't 
thought about it,'' Edwards said, but then offhandedly brushed the 
shoulder of one of his new colleagues on his way to his seat. 
</P>
<P>
	On his way to his chair, Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from  
Vermont, glided a bipartisan hand across the arm of Sen. Jim 
Jeffords, a Republican Vermonter. On his way out, Daschle coaxed a 
grin from Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., with a double pat 
to the arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Excessive touching can make a person feel uncomfortable, said  
Linda Carli, associate professor of psychology at Wellesley College 
in Massachusetts. But the hugs, high fives and handshakes exchanged 
among senators generally are not viewed as controlling gestures, 
Carli said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see the most amount of touch between women and the least  
among men, so it's very interesting that they're very touchy in the 
Senate,'' Carli said. ``That's just how they are. It facilitates 
getting things done, because it creates this sense of connection 
and community among them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Do male senators interact differently with the women who fill  
nine Senate seats? 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, it is different for a woman,'' said Sen. Dianne  
Feinstein, D-Calif. ``The U.S. Senate is still basically, in body 
language and in operation, very much a male institution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Feinstein and Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., touched one another  
on the arm as they chatted in the chamber. But it was restrained 
compared to the way Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., kept his hand firmly 
planted on the shoulder of Sen. John Breaux, D-La., during an 
animated exchange that lasted several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond was even more physical. He clutched Lott at the elbow  
and didn't let go even after Lott began to talk with somebody else. 
The two sat four seats apart all afternoon, yet they shook hands as 
if they hadn't seen each other in years. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all senators are gregarious.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are plenty of examples of icy, cold, aloof senators who  
weren't touchy-feely types,'' said Don Ritchie, associate Senate 
historian. Former Ohio Sen. Robert Taft ``had sort of an invisible 
shield around him that said, `Don't come close to me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, Ritchie said, former Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater  
once remarked that Lyndon Johnson, Senate majority leader in the 
1950s, was the ``only man who breathed in your mouth when he talked 
to you. He would get right in your face. It was known as the 
Johnson treatment.''

<HEADLINE> Law Threatens Battle Reenactment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- This Revolutionary War town is planning  
a big bash for the 225th anniversary of the Battle of Lexington 
next year, but organizers say the state's new gun control law is 
threatening the event's authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the latest celebration slated to go gunless under the law  
passed last year. During Gov. Paul Cellucci's recent inauguration, 
the Lexington Minute Men attended -- yet went without their 
traditional muskets because of new weapon storage requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	In this historic town, up to a quarter of a million visitors are  
expected for the three-day anniversary extravaganza in April 2000, 
along with 1,000 to 1,500 re-enactors of the battle itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayward Gardner, chairman of Lexington Commission 2000, says the  
party may go up in smoke unless the state amends its new gun law to 
exempt antique weapons from storage and trigger-lock requirements 
and to free re-enactors from having to get licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Susan Fargo, D-Lincoln, and state Rep. Jay Kaufman,  
D-Lexington, are talking to Cellucci and legislative leaders about 
amendments that would exempt muskets manufactured during or before 
1899 from the trigger lock and storage requirements mandated by the 
state's assault weapons law passed last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Most gun lockers don't fit the extra-long length of antique  
muskets, and the orange trigger locks available for them would 
stand out against the tone of a Revolutionary War re-enactment, 
Fargo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the amendments, the proposed Patriots Day 2000 bash also  
may be canceled. State lawmakers also have been working to amend 
the law to allow veterans to carry guns at Veterans Day parades. 
</P>
<P>
	``These amendments will allow us to balance the need for  
responsible gun control legislation while not detracting from 
events which celebrate our historic and cultural identity,'' Fargo 
said.

<HEADLINE> Kwan To Face Challenge at Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- In easily defending her European  
title, Maria Butyrskaya has emerged as the top challenger to 
defending champion Michelle Kwan for the world title. 
</P>
<P>
	The skaters have similar classical styles, mature and polished  
with elegant positions and strong jumps. What Butyrskaya has most 
lacked is consistency. 
</P>
<P>
	At 26, Butyrskaya has been Russian national champion six times,  
but only last year won her first major international title, at the 
Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
	The medal from her second European title Saturday seemed proof  
that her time has arrived, 
</P>
<P>
	``For the last two years, I've been skating quite  
consistently,'' she said. ``Some become Olympic champion at 16, but 
to me success came later. I had to fight with myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya's victory completed a Russian sweep of European  
figure skating titles for the third consecutive year. But for the 
first time, Russians won all three women's medals, dominating the 
championships as the men have for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian Federation has started to concentrate on bringing up  
the level of its women's skating, long the weakest element of the 
Russian team, and the results were evident at the European 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Two teen-agers just out of junior competition finished second  
and third behind Butyrskaya -- Julia Soldatova and Viktoria 
Volchkova, virtually guaranteeing the young skaters a place at the 
worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan is certainly the biggest obstacle to Russian hopes to a  
title sweep at the worlds in Helsinki, Finland, in two months, but 
she's not the only one. 
</P>
<P>
	French ice dancers Marina Anissina and Gwendel Peizerat are  
poised to upset the new European ice dancing champions Angelika 
Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov, taking down with them the 
long-standing ice dance hierarchy, if they do. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final free dance, the Russians skated a risky drum  
program that required great precision, but did not elicit the same 
audience response as the emotionally charged French program ``The 
Man in the Iron Mask.'' Skating the part of The Mask, Anissina 
lifted Peizerat, who leaned completely into her crouched figure, 
extended one leg in front of him and reached the other to his 
forehead. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges were split and the decision went to the Russians.  
French fans were outraged. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that the Russians were bothered.  
</P>
<P>
	``In Russia we have an expression, `Don't ask the winners why  
they won, just ask if they won,' '' Ovsiannikov said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian pairs skating got an unexpected boost at the Europeans  
when a couple training together only since June, Maria Petrova and 
Alexei Tikhonov, won the event after teammates and defending 
champions Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze dropped out with 
the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Russian men demonstrated their depth with another sweep.  
Alexei Yagudin, 18, overcame the disappointment of two recent 
losses to defend his title with a flawless, energetic free dance. 
Yevgeny Plushenko, 16, finished second, while the weakest link in 
the Russian troika was 1994 Olympic champion Alexei Urmanov, who 
fell on a triple axle and finished third.

<HEADLINE> Irish Farmers In Search of Wives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Patricia Cahill Jones and Jennifer Lucas were  
driving through the green rolling hills of southwest Ireland when 
they spotted a farmer walking cattle alongside the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, are you single?'' Ms. Jones hollered out the open car  
window. 
</P>
<P>
	The two New Yorkers weren't trolling for dates. Well, at least  
not directly. And not for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	They were on a quest to find 12 men to grace the pages of  
``Bachelor Farmers of Ireland Calendar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They found them. But Misters January through December -- ages 18  
to 89 -- are ``anything but beefcake,'' Ms. Jones concedes. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a journey that began in 1997 after the two longtime  
friends, both Irish-Americans, read an article about a shortage of 
women in County Kerry, Ireland, that was jeopardizing the existence 
of family farms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I loved the headline: `Shortage of women a threat to  
population,''' Ms. Lucas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The article said that between the ages of 25 and 29, there were  
61 single women to every 100 single men, and between the ages of 30 
to 34, there were 46 women to every 100 men. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the rate things are progressing, we could have a situation  
in a few years' time when schools in rural areas will be closing 
down because of the population decline, and the lack of job 
opportunities in the agriculture sector,'' said the Rev. Gearoid 
O'Donnchadha, a sociologist at the Institute of Technology in 
Tralee who studied the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the right idea at the right time,'' said Ms. Lucas, 32.  
``We thought ... for sure we could get some company to sponsor us. 
Boy, did we have a lot to learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After several months of receiving ``thank yous, but no thank  
yous'' from Irish businesses, the women founded Green Field 
Productions and decided to do it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	That's how they ended up on a two-lane road in County Kerry,  
searching for single men. They also leafletted pubs, published 
notices in newspapers, and had friends in Ireland approach men at 
weddings and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a lot of strange looks from people,'' said Ms. Jones,  
29. Both women assured the men that they were already engaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Cronin -- Mr. January -- first learned about the making of  
the calendar when a friend of the two women approached his brother 
at his wedding and asked if he knew any single men. 
</P>
<P>
	``They rang me up and asked me if I would mind being in a  
calendar. At first I was a bit skeptical about it. They had to ring 
back at least several times,'' Cronin said in a telephone interview 
from Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	After two trips to Ireland, the women found their 12 men and had  
them photographed in their farm settings. Each month features one 
of the men and bits about Irish tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	But to protect the bachelor farmers, only the men's first names  
are given. If women inquire about them, they are told their letters 
will be forwarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Cronin, 41, consented to be photographed -- dressed in a black  
wool sweater and jeans -- not for love but for attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most people figure we are on the calendar that we are  
looking for wives,'' he said. ``I wanted to focus on the problem of 
the farms -- bring attention to it ... not find a wife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he, and the rest of the calendar men, do respond to letters.  
</P>
<P>
	``They are mostly from women looking for partners,'' Cronin  
said. ``Some of them have said `it's the first time I've written.' 
...They are various ages and various sizes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A woman started writing Jerry Buckley -- Mr. June -- after seeing  
his face on a post office wall in Minneapolis. Although he wouldn't 
identify the woman, Buckley, 37, said they were getting along 
``famously'' through letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Age has not proven to be a barrier for possible romance. Just  
ask Tom Cahill, Ms. Jones' 89-year-old grandfather -- also known as 
Mr. March. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought at this age of my life I would be seeing  
myself on television and in all these magazines and newspapers 
around the world,'' he said. ``I am, of course, looking for fresh 
women if they care to write me.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offers $1.77 Trillion Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is sending Congress a $1.77  
trillion spending plan for 2000, beginning a new century with 
record budget surpluses he wants to save for Social Security. He 
also proposes sizable new sums for the military, education, the 
environment and public health. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget forecasts $2.41 trillion in surpluses over the  
next decade, laying out a vision of a budget landscape the country 
has not known in 70 years, before the Great Depression, World War 
II and the Cold War put the United States into a rut of chronic 
deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	But even before the budget's formal release today, Republicans  
who control Congress were letting it be known they have a far 
different view of how the government should operate in an era of 
surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	To the Republicans, tax relief should be at center stage after  
protecting Social Security. They already have offered proposals 
that would provide an across-the-board 10 percent cut in income 
taxes, returning at least $600 billion to taxpayers over the next 
decade. That, they say, is critical to keep the Democrats from 
creating new spending programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question that this document is the rebirth of big  
government,'' Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, 
R-N.M., said of Clinton's spending blueprint. ``The president can't 
resist a program for every problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of Clinton's proposals require approval by Congress, and it  
is unclear how both sides will be eager to reach compromises in 
view of the contentious impeachment battle and with a presidential 
campaign looming. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to the GOP call for across-the-board tax cuts,  
attacked by Democrats as a sop to the wealthy, Clinton's budget 
offers much more targeted tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	He proposes a $1,000 tax credit to help people handle long-term  
health care costs and a $500 child care credit for stay-at-home 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's new budget also includes several proposals that  
Republicans have rejected in past years -- including a 
55-cent-a-pack increase in federal cigarette taxes. The budget also 
puts forward a controversial federal claim to $18.9 billion of the 
$246 billion the states have won from the tobacco industry in court 
settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	That tobacco money would go to defray federal costs of treating  
smokers' illnesses. Clinton's budget pays for other new spending by 
increasing various user fees and business taxes, many of which 
Congress has also rejected in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Anxious to show the president hard at work despite his  
impeachment travails, the White House kept up a steady drumbeat of 
announcements beginning before Christmas about what would be 
included in the budget, which takes effect Oct. 1. Federal spending 
this year is estimated at $1.71 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	As first outlined in his State of the Union message, Clinton is  
proposing using 62 percent of the $4.4 trillion in projected 
surpluses over the next 15 years to shore up Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans agree that much of the surplus should be set aside  
for the retirement of 76 million baby boomers, although they 
disagree with the president on the best way to do this. 
</P>
<P>
	But the big fight is expected over what to do with the rest of  
the projected surpluses. Clinton wants to devote the rest of the 
surplus to support Medicare, provide additional spending for the 
military and domestic programs and set up new ``USA'' retirement 
accounts. Republicans are pushing broadbased tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists warn that the government's projections for a decade  
of surpluses, something last achieved in the 1920s, could evaporate 
quickly if, for example, still-turbulent overseas financial markets 
push the United States into an unexpected recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget forecasts a $79 billion surplus in the current  
1999 fiscal year, which runs through Sept. 30, and $117 billion in 
black ink in 2000. The $2.41 trillion in total surpluses the 
administration envisions is about $160 billion below the amount 
forecast last week by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. 
</P>
<P>
	The booming U.S. economy, responsible for the longest expansion  
in peacetime history, is credited with producing the government's 
first surplus in 29 years -- $70 billion for the 1998 budget year 
that ended last September.

<HEADLINE> Chandler Fails in Biggest Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- In the NFC championship game, Chris Chandler looked  
like John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Super Bowl, Chandler looked like ... well, the old Chris  
Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
	The journeyman who ricocheted to five teams in his first nine  
seasons resurfaced against the Denver Broncos, throwing three 
interceptions Sunday night to doom any chances of an upset for the 
Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could have done things better,'' Chandler said. ``But they  
did a good job covering things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Chandler and his teammates were new at all this, so maybe  
it was understandable they froze up against the savvy Broncos, who 
won their second straight championship with a 34-19 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	A few days earlier, Chandler chuckled when a reporter pointed  
out he had a better quarterback rating than Elway the last two 
seasons. Even Chandler knew it was a ludicrous to give the Falcons 
an advantage at that position. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler, who had thrown only 13 interceptions all season, was  
picked off on three straight possessions in the second half, the 
first two coming when there was still a glimmer of hope for the 
Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	With Atlanta trailing 17-6, Chandler moved the Falcons to the  
Denver 41 with a 19-yard pass to Tony Martin and a 12-yard run of 
his own. But Chandler was sacked for a 6-yard loss, then misfired 
on a pass over the middle that was picked off by Darrius Johnson 
and returned 28 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's Jason Elam missed his second straight field goal,  
keeping Atlanta hanging on by its fingertips. Once again, the 
Falcons couldn't maintain their grip. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler's pass was deflected at the line by Keith Traylor and  
landed right in the hands of Darrien Gordon, who returned it 58 
yards to set up a touchdown run by Howard Griffith. The score was 
24-6, the game was out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things were there for the taking,'' Chandler said. ``It was  
just unlucky things that happened. A guy tips a ball. You never 
plan on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler had one final chance, moving the Falcons to the Denver  
21. But he overthrew a pass just short of the end zone, leaping in 
the air in disbelief as Gordon picked off another one. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-yard return that followed set up another touchdown. This  
season was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``They covered things well in the red areas (inside the 20) and  
they deserve some credit,'' Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a vagabond career, the 33-year-old quarterback finally  
found a home with the Falcons, who acquired him for mere fourth- 
and sixth-round draft picks prior to the 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he's been a Pro Bowler twice and actually posted  
better numbers the last two seasons than Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler's stature vaulted even higher when he threw for 340  
yards against the heavily favored Minnesota Vikings in the 
conference title game. He directed a game-tying touchdown drive 
with less than a minute to go in regulation, then drove the Falcons 
into range for the winning field goal in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	But the traits that marked Chandler's turn in life deserted him  
in the biggest game of his life. And Elway walked off the field as 
a unanimous choice for MVP, with his second straight Super Bowl 
victory.

	GOP Questions Impeachment Votes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Monica Lewinsky waited at the Mayflower  
Hotel for her deposition tomorrow, Republican senators today 
questioned whether they had enough votes to remove President 
Clinton from office. Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., indicated that 
getting even 50 votes for conviction in a chamber controlled by 55 
Republican senators is in doubt. House prosecutors have shifted 
their focus to the obstruction charge on the assumption that even 
among Republicans who believe that Clinton lied under oath, there 
is questionable support for the notion that the untruths were 
serious enough to warrant the president's removal, one official 
said. 

</P>
<P>
	Polls: Most Want Clinton To Stay  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- According to three new polls, most Americans  
don't want President Clinton removed from office. Weekend surveys 
by Newsweek, the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post also 
found that a majority of Americans said they disapprove of the 
Senate's decision to hear new testimony from Monica Lewinsky, 
Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal. Polls have consistently found 
that roughly six in 10 Americans want Clinton to stay in office 
despite accusations that he tried to cover up an affair with Ms. 
Lewinsky.

The planes were trailing banners emblazoned with everything from

	Bank Offers $92M for Holocaust Role  
</P>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- An Austrian bank accused of having  
profited from the sale of gold taken from Jewish Holocaust victims 
will pay $92 million in restitution, a U.S. lawyer representing 
survivors said today. In exchange for the relatively low sum, the 
Bank Austria group promised to cooperate in similar investigations 
against German banks, said lawyer Ed Fagan. Bank Austria ``will 
provide us with documents that will open the way to the main vein 
of gold,'' Fagan said, pointing to Germany's Deutsche Bank and 
Dresdner Bank. The two banks are thought to have profited from 
Holocaust victims in a number of ways, including keeping gold taken 
from victims and put into Nazis' accounts.

	Scientists: AIDS Came From Chimps

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Scientists believe they have solved the lingering  
mystery of where the AIDS virus came from: chimps. In a 
presentation today, researchers from the University of Alabama at 
Birmingham said they have convincing proof that the virus has 
spread on at least three separate occasions from chimpanzees to 
people in Africa. One of these cross-species transmissions was the 
start of the epidemic that now infects about 35 million people 
worldwide.

Organization set Feb. 1 as its target date to replace dots and 
dashes with a satellite system -- the Global Maritime Distress and 
Safety System -- that can pinpoint the location of a ship signaling

pressure for a 6.5 percent wage hike. IG Metall, the metal and 
electrical workers' union that includes Germany's large auto 
industry, said it plans daily warning strikes in parts of the 
country. At least 40 strikes -- some lasting a day, others just a 
few hours -- were scheduled to take place in the western state of 
North Rhine-Westphalia, and 10 in the southern state of Bavaria.

<HEADLINE> Webb Wins 1999 LPGA Office Depot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Karrie Webb solved the 17th hole on  
her final trip around the Ibis Country Club course, and it paid 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just emotionally exhausted,'' said a victorious Webb, who  
birdied the 16th and 17th holes to capture the LPGA's Office Depot 
golf tournament with a 10-under-par 278 -- just one stroke ahead of 
the tightly bunched field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to get a win early in the year. I was in contention  
the last two weeks,'' said Webb, who tied for second at Orlando and 
for seventh at Naples after sharing the third-round lead with Julie 
Inkster. ``My last win was in April at Myrtle Beach. That's the 
longest I've gone without winning in the U.S.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's victory was the 10th for the 24-year-old Australian  
in a little more than three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Tied for second at 9-under 279 were Kris Tschetter and Dottie  
Pepper, who had rounds of 66 and 71. Gail Graham, Kelly Robbins and 
Juli Inkster had final-round tallies were 67, 71 and 72, 
respectively, to finish at 208. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb led after each of the four rounds, but it wasn't easy. She  
was tied with Inkster after the first round, with Betsy King after 
the second and with Pepper and Inkster after three. 
</P>
<P>
	Going into the par-5 17th on Saturday, she was tied for the lead  
at 9-under with Tschetter, who had finished nearly an hour ahead of 
the leaders, Pepper, Inkster and Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 17th hole on Friday, Webb was assessed a two-stroke  
penalty after she accidentally grounded her club in a hazard. That 
dropped Webb into a tie for the third-round lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I thought about it for a moment when I got to the 17th  
tee today,'' Webb said, ``but I don't think you can say a hole owes 
you anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried not to dwell on it,'' she acknowledged.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, Saturday's final round proved quite a rollercoaster ride  
for Webb, the 1996 Rookie of the Year. That same year, she became 
the first LPGA player to earn $1 million in one season. 
</P>
<P>
	After birdies in the first and fourth holes, she three-putted  
the third, sixth and seventh for bogeys. Putts of 20 and 10 feet 
led to birdies at the ninth and 10th. She bogeyed the 15th, then 
pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
	At the par-5 11th hole, Robbins, the 1997 winner here, moved to  
10-under-par with a 50-foot eagle putt. She fell back, though, with 
bogeys on the 15th and 16th. 
</P>
<P>
	The 72-hole, $675,000 tournament ended a day early to avoid  
conflict with the Sunday's Super Bowl in Miami.

<HEADLINE> Comfort the Emphasis in Menswear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Menswear for the Millennium? Forget Star Trek  
costumes or futuristic cyber-gear. That was what Pierre Cardin 
showed way back in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	The emphasis was on comfort in Paris menswear shows that ended  
Saturday. Relaxed silhouettes featured pants bagging around the 
ankles and extra-long jackets with narrow lapels and, in some 
fashion houses, skirts. 
</P>
<P>
	Plenty of cozy sweaters and fascinating knit wear were  
outstanding, whether in cashmere, mohair or sophisticated new 
fabric blends. 
</P>
<P>
	The many fly-fronted duffels, parkas, and comforting long coats  
are good outerwear for next winter's wardrobes. 
</P>
<P>
	Colors were deep charcoal-dark to silvery-gray, brown, khaki and  
black. But lashings of white or ivory made a contrast. Hot pink 
shirts and ties at Leonard, or luscious royal-cobalt blue in a 
jumpsuit at Saint Laurent, livened up the mainly dark looks. 
</P>
<P>
	There also were touches of eccentricity, and it reached new  
heights at Comme des Garcons, where Rei Kawakubo brought on a 
startling group of vagabond types in head scarfs. The pants looked 
as droopy as skirts, nipped in at the ankles and worn with loud 
socks and mohair bedroom slippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Skirts? Count on Kawakubo. They came out pleated, in a gala gold  
or dashing kilts in white, worn over pants. Then there were the 
rumpled tweed suits that looked like they went to the wrong 
cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fun category, the Yohji Yamamoto show won, for the  
dark-suited musicians dressed up in his long jackets and coats, and 
flat-pleated skirts. 
</P>
<P>
	Some coats had evening-style tails, even for daytime, and long  
Austrian-style knit jackets. 
</P>
<P>
	For Lanvin, Dominique Morlotti showed an excellent casual-city  
line, with a great variety of fabrics, from light gray mohair coats 
to super windbreakers or hooded parkas in silvery metal threads and 
polyamide. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-button charcoal gray suits often had extra-long jackets,  
pants a bit wide and droopy around the ankle. Sweaters in heavy 
cable knits were also featured, with lighter merino and viscose 
pullovers for country contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonia Rykiel's sportswear was outstanding with a collection that  
looked just right for a fellow in double-faced short coats or nylon 
parkas. There were also practical cargo pants and jeans turned up 
neatly in a wide cuff. 
</P>
<P>
	Reversibles, leather jackets and brightly striped thin-wool and  
cashmere pullovers or giant handmade sweaters and scarves with 
textured stripes made the Rykiel man an attractive item. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenzo offered some fine heavy, tweedy-looking pullovers worn  
with bold glen plaid pants. Turtlenecks in chartreuse, purple or 
plum light up the dark hues. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomato red leather trousers, shoes and a full suit pepped up  
this runway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yves Saint Laurent collection by Frenchman Hedi Slimane was  
a slick assortment based on darks and white, with good sailor tops, 
canvas trench coats and long, dressy dark coats. 
</P>
<P>
	But the silky shirts that turn into see-through tulle or chiffon  
scattered with sequins for evening might go down well only in 
trendy discos -- like the slick flat-front evening trousers worn 
with bare torso. 
</P>
<P>
	The collections underscored the array of fashion choices now  
confronting men. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander von Slobbe, a Dutchman who crafts sober clothes with  
innocent purity, played with wools and nylons to turn out good 
shirts, shirt-jackets and parkas with pockets all over the place 
for his ``SO'' line. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish designer Armand Basi, inspired by the Russian  
Constructivist art movement of the 1930s, came out with long 
gray-blue, belted Soviet-soldier coats. They were matched with 
earflap hats suitable for a serious Siberian winter.

<HEADLINE> Activist Bauer To Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conservative activist Gary Bauer, saying he  
has a vision for the country that will excite the American people, 
announced Sunday his intention to run for the Republican nomination 
for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, 52, admitted that ``a lot of Americans probably don't  
know me yet'' but said he has the conservative credentials and 
money-raising skills necessary for a viable candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, interviewed on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said he will  
file papers Monday with the Federal Election Commission on forming 
a presidential exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm anxious and enthusiastic about getting into this debate  
and seeing if we can elevate it, see if we can put some real issues 
on the table for the American people,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In preparation for his presidential bid, the former Reagan  
administration official took a leave of absence this month as head 
of the Family Research Council, which under Bauer has come to rival 
the Christian Coalition as the voice of grass-roots conservative 
activism. 
</P>
<P>
	He said banning abortion would be a major plank in his platform  
and that as president, one of his first legislative goals would be 
making it unlawful to perform abortions in the second or third 
trimester of a pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said he supports a flat tax with an across-the-board 16  
percent rate for all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he supports removing President Clinton from office  
over the Monica Lewinsky affair. He said he doesn't understand how 
any senator could decide the charges against Clinton were not 
serious enough to convict him of the impeachment charges, perjury 
and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senators who vote to acquit just naturally in many states will  
end up facing challengers in primaries,'' Bauer said.

<HEADLINE> Taylor Chides Hall of Fame Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Lawrence Taylor insists some of the writers who  
elected him to the Pro Football Hall of Fame are ``old phonies'' 
and not fit to judge him. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Sunday with Fox Sports News, Taylor said the  
voters were holding him to a standard they would not apply to 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, a New York Giants linebacker and the dominant defensive  
player of his time, was elected Saturday in his first year of 
eligibility. He was joined by running back Eric Dickerson, tight 
end Ozzie Newsome and guards Tom Mack and Billy Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes of the 36-member panel were not disclosed, but Taylor  
was admitted by being listed on at least 80 percent of the ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys sit around -- old phonies ... I call them -- and sit  
there and blast and criticize me and say he shouldn't be in the 
Hall of Fame because he's morally wrong while they sit around 
getting high on their third or fourth highball,'' Taylor told Fox, 
without identifying any writer by name. 
</P>
<P>
	Furman Bisher of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution was one of the  
writers who voted against Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please tell him to get it right: I'm an old fogey, not an old  
phony,'' said Bisher, who attended the same college as Taylor. 
``I'm a North Carolina grad and he makes me ashamed of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suspended once while he was playing and arrested twice on drug  
charges after he retired, Taylor has struggled with off-the-field 
problems that left some voters uneasy with his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike baseball, there is no ``citizenship'' clause in the  
football hall's bylaws, and NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue 
endorsed Taylor's election. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor thanked the New York sports writers who covered him  
during his 13 seasons with the Giants, saying they ``came to my 
defense'' even though they ``dogged me the most.'' However, he 
remained contemptuous of many of the writers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got those guys, and they want to sit there and put me  
on some moral trip,'' Taylor said. ``They'll hold me to a standard 
higher than they'll hold themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``And they'll go here to South Beach, get totally trashed and  
chase some little 13-year-old up and down the street -- but they're 
all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor was the NFL's top defensive player three times and its  
MVP for the 1986 season, when he led the Giants to the first of two 
Super Bowl titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor is in Florida filming an Oliver Stone movie about  
football. He said he was playing golf Saturday when he learned of 
his selection. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was happy to make it, but I was a little bit upset because  
they were saying, `L.T., Hall of Fame,' but they've got to put an 
asterisk beside it,'' Taylor said. ``That's what I didn't like.''

<HEADLINE>  Marathon Planned in Antarctica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rush McCloy hopes Vermont isn't much different  
from Antarctica. He has run in Vermont and is about to try 
Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's summer in the Southern Hemisphere; the temperatures are  
10 to 15 degrees,'' said McCloy, a 24-year-old analyst with Chase 
Securities in New York City. ``In Vermont, it was 10 to 15 degrees. 
The temperatures were fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCloy and two friends will join about 130 other adventurers in  
the 3rd Antarctica Marathon &AMP; Half Marathon Feb. 13. The trip and 
the race are organized by Marathon Tours, a Boston travel agency 
that specializes in runners. Although McCloy and his friends are 
running to raise research funds for Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer 
Center in New York City, the others are in it for the pure 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Running the marathon now is commonplace,'' said Marathon  
Tours' owner, Thom Gilligan. ``In the '70s, it was the talk of the 
cocktail circuit. Now people want to do something off the beaten 
track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's hard to get farther off the beaten track than the end of  
the continent of South America -- after which, the trouble starts. 
</P>
<P>
	From Ushuaia, Argentina, the world's southernmost city, the  
runners board two former Soviet research vessels for a two-day 
voyage across the Drake Passage, whose 30-foot seas make it one of 
the world's roughest bodies of water. Seasickness is not unheard 
of. ``We are rocking and rolling,'' Gilligan said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a couple of days for recovery and sightseeing among the  
ice floes and penguins, participants will set out across a race 
course that includes crossing a boulder field, a seal cove, a 
glacial stream and a glacier. All must finish the 26.2 miles in 
under 6 hours, 30 minutes. Those who don't finish the half marathon 
in 3 hours, 10 minutes are disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
	Sound rugged? ``People didn't go to Antarctica to have a walk in  
the sunshine,'' Gilligan said. Weather can turn very nasty; the 
last race was marked by a blizzard, and ``once you start climbing 
up a glacier in 40-mile-an-hour winds blowing against you, it takes 
the romance out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just the same, it shouldn't be scary, Gilligan added. For  
instance, the crevasses in the glacier should be easy to spot -- 
even easy to climb out of, if a runner falls in. 
</P>
<P>
	And good preparation always reduces the risk. McCloy has been  
training for five months, using the New York City Marathon as a 
warmup for the Antarctic expedition. In November, he and his 
friends Basil Seggos and J.J. Hill-Wood began running on snowmobile 
trails in the mountains of Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermont is as close as they could get to Antarctica and still be  
within commuting distance of New York City, where they have jobs, 
McCloy said. As for the boulders, crevasses and glaciers, they'll 
have to adjust to those after they arrive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would tell them to keep their eye on the weather,''  
commented Andrew Young, a research physiologist at the U.S. Army 
Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, Natick, Mass. ``You 
can get on a Web site and check it out. My guess is, yes, it's cold 
-- but it's probably like wintertime here in Boston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the marathoners run hard, they will generate so much body  
heat that ``they won't experience any body cooling even if the 
temperature is as low as minus 20 degrees,'' said Young, who 
specializes in the effects of cold on soldiers. But if it gets to 
minus 30, the race should be called off, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The runners plan to dress for the weather, with thick thermal  
Spandex clothing under an outer shell, Gore-Tex running shoes, 
double-lined socks, gloves, headgear -- and sunglasses for 
protection against the wind. ``The scariest thing is lung freeze,'' 
McCloy said. ``When it gets too cold, I wear a mask around my face 
that warms the air slightly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Runners may also have to look out for each other, especially if  
they see signs of hypothermia, McCloy said. ``In this race, you are 
not out for your personal best,'' he said. ``If you see someone 
fallen, you help them to safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And race organizers need to do the same, especially right after  
the marathon, Young said. Runners will end the race sweaty and 
exhausted. The exhaustion could weaken their ability to raise body 
heat through the repeated muscle contractions of shivering or 
reduce heat loss by tightening the blood vessels in the skin, he 
said.

	Kosovo Rebels May Oppose Talks  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ethnic Albanian rebels are hinting  
at opposition to international peace talks on Kosovo this week, 
saying negotiations ``organized in a rush'' cannot resolve the 
conflict. Meanwhile, violence erupted again Sunday, despite 
international demands to halt the fighting. Police sources, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, said three Serb policemen 
returning from the funeral of a slain officer were wounded late 
Sunday when ethnic Albanian rebels fired a grenade at their van in 
the village of Istinic, 45 miles southwest of Kosovo's capital, 
Pristina.

	Depositions Begin With Lewinsky  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors are questioning Monica  
Lewinsky under oath as they enter the final phase of their attempt 
to turn the tide and prove that President Clinton should be removed 
from office. With that attempt likely to fail, the senators sitting 
in judgment of the president were scrambling for a way they 
themselves will be judged kindly by history after they acquit 
Clinton of articles of impeachment. House prosecutors and White 
House lawyers each had four hours Monday to question Ms. Lewinsky 
about her affair with Clinton and charges that he committed perjury 
and obstructed justice in trying to conceal their relationship. 

</P>
<P>
	Most Want Clinton To Stay in Office  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most Americans don't want President Clinton  
removed from office, according to three new polls. Weekend surveys 
by Newsweek, the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post also 
found that a majority of Americans said they disapprove of the 
Senate's decision to hear new testimony from Monica Lewinsky, 
Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal. Polls have consistently found 
that roughly six in 10 Americans want Clinton to stay in office 
despite accusations that he tried to cover up an affair with Ms. 
Lewinsky.

	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- An Austrian bank accused of having  
profited from the sale of gold taken from Jewish Holocaust victims 
will pay $92 million in restitution, a U.S. lawyer representing 
survivors said in comments published Sunday. In exchange for the 
relatively low sum, the Bank Austria group promised to cooperate in 
similar investigations against German banks, said lawyer Ed Fagan, 
quoted in the weekly Format and by the Austria Press Agency. Bank 
Austria ``will provide us with documents that will open the way to 
the main vein of gold,'' Fagan said, pointing to Germany's Deutsche 
Bank and Dresdner Bank.

century for his work to modernize the education system, died at age 
84. Godwin, elected as a Democrat in 1965 and as a Republican in 
1973, was praised Sunday by leaders of both parties for 
transforming the once largely rural state with a community college 
system and a state sales tax for school improvements.

	Rare Blue Moon Rises  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A blue moon rose Sunday, and another blue moon will  
be coming on the night of March 31. Two blue moons in one year 
happens every 20 to 40 years. The last time was in 1961. The term 
``blue moon'' refers to the occasional occurrence of two full moons 
in the same month, which usually happens roughly once every 33 
months. The last full moon was Jan. 2. The second full moon in a 
month is called a blue moon, regardless of tint. Astronomers 
predict the next occurrence of two blue moons in one year will be 
in 2018, on Jan. 31 and March 31, and again on the same dates in 
2037.

Super Bowl ring. Elway, the unanimous choice for MVP, completed 18 
of 29 passes for 336 yards and one touchdown and ran 3 yards for 
another score. The total yardage was third best in Super Bowl 
history. Terrell Davis, the league MVP, carried 25 times for 102 
yards for his seventh consecutive postseason 100-yard game, 
breaking an NFL record set by John Riggins.

	Crowds Gassed in Denver After Game  
</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Police used tear gas Sunday night to disperse  
crowds downtown after Denver Broncos fans spilled into the streets 
to celebrate a second straight Super Bowl victory. In Lower 
Downtown, bars emptied as the game ended and fans started bonfires 
and set off firecrackers in Larimer Square. When the estimated 
crowd of 1,000 would not disperse, police threw tear gas canisters 
and marched down Larimer Street in riot gear, pounding their 
shields with their clubs.

<HEADLINE> Women Assert More Control in Wash. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- It was the ideal photo-op to illustrate  
just how far women have come as powerbrokers in the Washington 
state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60 female senators and representatives recently posed next  
to a photo montage of the House membership of a century earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lot of facial hair there,'' Rep. Mary Lou Dickerson  
said of the older picture. ``All men. What a difference a century 
makes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, women hold 41 percent of the 147 seats in the state's  
House and Senate -- giving Washington the country's highest 
percentage of female lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate, a male bastion for most of the state's history, is  
closing in on an even split with 23 women among the 49 members. The 
House has 37 women among the 98 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the surest signs of their newfound power came when women  
senators took over the biggest bathroom off the Senate chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	The women are still chuckling over that little power play, made  
possible by their 2-to-1 majority in the Democratic caucus. They've 
also nailed down just about every Senate leadership and committee 
post. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Sid Snyder jokes about being one of the  
token males in the Democratic caucus, which has 18 women and nine 
men. 
</P>
<P>
	The female legislators say they'll improve the tone of debate  
and produce more family-centered legislation, dealing with schools 
and traffic jams and other down-home concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	No more good ol' boys and talking issues to death, they say.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're just nervier,'' says state Rep. Ida Ballasiotes.  
</P>
<P>
	The national average for female legislators is 22 percent,  
according to the Center for the American Woman and Politics at 
Rutgers University. Other states in the top 10, with women making 
up roughly a third of their lawmakers, are Nevada, Arizona, 
Colorado, Kansas, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Maryland and 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama, which has less than 8 percent female legislators, is at  
the other end of the scale with Oklahoma, Kentucky, South Carolina 
and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides installing the nation's highest percentage of female  
legislators, Washington voters in November re-elected Patty Murray 
to the U.S. Senate -- over a female opponent -- and gave the state 
three female Supreme Court justices, a third of the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's executive branch has women as attorney general,  
school chief, land commissioner and insurance commissioner -- all 
elected posts. Attorney General Christine Gregoire was the broker 
of last year's multibillion-dollar settlement between the states 
and the tobacco industry.

	``In Washington, it's not a novelty,'' says Cathy Allen, vice  
chairwoman of the National Women's Political Caucus and a Seattle 
political consultant. ``We became accustomed very early on to 
voting for the gutsy, entrepreneurial women who were role models in 
government, business and the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, however, is the first in the nation to have an  
all-female elected line of succession: governor, secretary of 
state, attorney general, treasurer and superintendent of public 
instruction. They were all sworn in by U.S. Supreme Court Justice 
Sandra Day O'Connor, an Arizonian who was the first woman appointed 
to the nation's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their gains, Washington state Sen. Darlene Fairley,  
D-Lake Forest Park, still sees vestiges of sexism. Some male 
lawmakers, she said, still talk about the ``girls'' taking over and 
``gripe, gripe, gripe'' when the women assert themselves.

<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Cornelius Bennett didn't try to hide his  
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta linebacker was on the losing Super Bowl team for the  
fifth time, and he conceded it hurt more than most people could 
imagine. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never get used to this losing,'' said the 12th-year pro,  
who appeared in four title games with the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``If John (Elway) wants to stick around for a third in a row, I  
want to stick around to get one. I'll keep trying. Hopefully, I'll 
be back for a sixth time next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said one of the reasons he feels fortunate, despite the  
outcome of the Super Bowls he's played in, can be summed up by a 
conversation he had with former player Eric Dickerson. 
</P>
<P>
	He ran into Dickerson on Saturday and congratulated the  
ex-running back on being elected to the Hall of Fame in his first 
year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Yeah, but you've been to a bunch of Super Bowls.' I  
said, `Yeah, but I haven't won one.' He said, `Yeah dog, but you've 
been there.' That shows how much it means to players just to get to 
this situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SPARKPLUG:* Falcons return man Tim Dwight scored Atlanta's  
first touchdown on a 94-yard kickoff return early in the fourth 
quarter. He returned five kicks for 210 yards, setting a Super Bowl 
record by averaging 42 yards per return. 
</P>
<P>
	He criticized himself, though, for not scoring earlier to give  
the team a spark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to shoot myself ... and say: `Why didn't I do it  
sooner.' I had a chance on the first one, but I hesitated a little 
bit and didn't get it done,'' Dwight said. ``It might have 
helped.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ELWAY RECORDS:* John Elway set two Super Bowl career records.  
</P>
<P>
	His 23rd pass was his 146th in five championships games, moving  
him ahead of Jim Kelly, who threw 145 in four Super Bowl 
appearances for the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway also threw his eighth interception, breaking the career  
mark he shared with Kelly and Craig Morton, who was intercepted 
seven times in two Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway became the oldest player to score a touchdown in the title  
game on a 3-yard run in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RUN SUPPORT:* Once again, Denver fullback Howard Griffith  
played a role in the success of Terrell Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was much more just an effective blocker against the  
Falcons, scoring on a pair of 1-yard touchdown runs while Davis 
played decoy. 
</P>
<P>
	They were first rushing TDs this season for Griffith, who had  
just four carries for 13 yards during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BY THE NUMBERS:* Elway and Chris Chandler formed the oldest  
starting quarterback combination in Super Bowl history Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, 38, and Chandler, 33, surpassed the combined age of Jim  
Plunkett (36) and Joe Theismann (34) in the 1984 game. Plunkett got 
the better of that matchup, leading the Los Angeles Raiders to a 
38-9 victory over the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler became the 19th starting quarterback to wear No. 12 in  
a Super Bowl. Ten of the previous 18 won, including Terry Bradshaw 
(four times), Roger Staubach (twice), Bob Griese (twice) and Ken 
Stabler and Joe Namath (once each). 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterbacks who wore No. 12 and lost were Jim Kelly (four  
times), Staubach (twice), Griese (once) and Stan Humphries (once). 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterbacks wearing No. 7 had a 2-7 record before Sunday,  
including a 1-3 mark by Elway. Theismann is the only other 
quarterback to win a Super Bowl in No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PROUD TRADITION:* No AFC team has made more Super Bowl  
appearances than the Broncos, who have been in the title game six 
times. Denver is the eighth franchise to reach the game in 
consecutive seasons and joined Dallas, Green Bay and Pittsburgh as 
the only clubs to make consecutive appearances on two separate 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys, with eight appearances, are the only team that has  
been to the Super Bowl more than the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *EXPERIENCE FACTOR:* Jessie Tuggle, Atlanta's Pro Bowl  
linebacker, waited 12 years to play in a Super Bowl. Four 
teammates, however, had previous experience in title games. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Bennett, who's played in five games, safety Eugene  
Robinson appeared in his third straight. Cornerback Randy Fuller 
and receiver Tony Martin each played in their second Super Bowl. 
Martin, a native of Miami, had the added satisfaction of playing 
for the championship in his hometown for the second time in five 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO DOME ADVANTAGE:* The Falcons, the first team that plays home  
games in a domed stadium to get to a Super Bowl, played outdoors 
Sunday for the first time since a 41-10 victory at New England on 
Nov. 8. That was a stretch of nine games in which they went 9-0. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RECORD COVERAGE:* Global coverage of the Super Bowl has grown  
to include the record 175 international media organizations issued 
credentials for Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 466 credentials were granted to international  
journalists, compared to the 338 total credentials issued for the 
first Super Bowl in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CLASSIC TURNAROUND:* Atlanta's first Super Bowl appearance  
capped the second-fastest turnaround in NFL history. The Falcons 
were 3-13 two seasons ago and were 1-7 in 1997 before blossoming 
under coach Dan Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco 49ers pulled off the biggest turnaround, going  
from 2-14 in 1979 to Super Bowl champions during the 1981 season. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *COIN TOSS:* Ten participants from the 1958 NFL championship  
game that generally is regarded as ``The Greatest Game Ever 
Played'' were on the field for the coin toss ceremony Sunday. Lenny 
Moore, Raymond Berry, Art Donovan and Gino Marchetti represented 
the Baltimore Colts, while Tom Landry, Sam Huff, Frank Gifford, 
Roosevelt Brown, Andy Robustelli and Don Maynard represented the 
New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SUPER ROTATION:* The next three Super Bowls also are scheduled  
to be played in the Southeast. Next year's site is the Georgia Dome 
in Atlanta. The 2001 game is slated for Tampa's Raymond James 
Stadium, followed by a 2002 stop at the Louisiana Superdome in New 
Orleans.

<HEADLINE> Kafelnikov Proves Himself Wrong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- The Ironman feels like Superman.  
</P>
<P>
	Less than six months ago, Yevgeny Kafelnikov didn't think he  
could win another major tournament. Now he's ready to jump tall 
buildings in a single bound. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of different things that happened to me, to just  
relieve pressure from my head,'' Kafelnikov said, after beating 
Thomas Enqvist 4-6, 6-0, 6-3, 7-6 (7-1) Sunday for the Australian 
Open title. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you combine these things you feel like you can jump over  
the China wall without having any difficulties. That's how I feel 
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian, who nearly retired from tennis to win his second  
Grand Slam title, called his feat better the second time because it 
dispelled the notion he was a ``one-Slam wonder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov is the hardest worker in tennis. He played 150  
matches last year -- 27 more than his nearest rival, Pat Rafter, and 
68 more than top-ranked Pete Sampras, in 10th place. He has played 
more matches than anyone on the tour for four of the past five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	But mid-1998, after being sidelined during the first month by an  
injury to his left knee from a skiing accident, Kafelnikov was 
disillusioned and had lost belief in his ability. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the U.S. Open in August, the 1996 French Open winner was  
asked if he had the hunger and drive to win more major titles and 
become No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not any more,'' Kafelnikov said. ``It's way beyond my ability.  
For a little while I did believe I could get there, but ... it's in 
the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's different.  
</P>
<P>
	After reaching the quarterfinals or better in six of the 10  
Slams he played between 1995 and 1997, he missed the Australian 
Open in 1998, then failed to get past the fourth round in the other 
three Slams. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, he dropped out of the top 10 rankings for four weeks,  
the longest period he had been out since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	As life on court atrophied, there were big changes in his  
personal life. 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov got married in July, his daughter was born in  
October, and in December, his grandfather died -- the Russian 
dedicated his Australian win to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Kafelnikov said he would start 1999 with Larry Stefanki,  
former coach for world No. 2 Marcelo Rios, as his coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a grinder,'' Stefanki said of Kafelnikov after the  
Australian win. ``He's got a tough Russian heart. If he had lost, I 
would have hung him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov began the Open overweight and sluggish, but he grew  
stronger during the tournament, especially by playing tough matches 
against Romania's Andrei Pavel and Australia's Jason Stoltenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov shrugged off the suggestion a two-time Grand Slam  
winner doesn't need to play a 150-match schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm motivated,'' he said. ``I'm ready to go again.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Ironman is steeled to win.

<P>
	Report: Starr May Seek Indictment  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr reportedly  
has concluded he has the constitutional authority to seek a grand 
jury indictment of President Clinton before Clinton leaves office. 
But The New York Times says Starr has not decided whether to do so. 
White House aides quickly responded, calling Starr an ``out of 
control prosecutor'' who is ``tampering with the Senate trial.'' 
The Times reported that Starr agreed with the conclusion of two 
constitutional law scholars hired as consultants that the 
Constitution does not bar indictment of a sitting president.

	U.S. Warplane Fires at Iraqi Site  
</P>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- A U.S. warplane enforcing the northern  
``no-fly'' zone over Iraq fired a high-speed missile at an Iraqi 
air defense installation today for the second consecutive day of 
confrontations, U.S. officials said. A statement from Operation 
Northern Watch said the Iraqi radar system posed a threat to the 
F-16 and coalition forces conducting routine enforcement of the 
no-fly zone above the 36th parallel. U.S. jet fighters yesterday 
fired missiles on Iraqi defense sites in six incidents around the 
city of Mosul. It was the single largest number of confrontations 
in a single day since Iraq began to challenge the jets in the 
no-fly zone last month. 

</P>
<P>
	Iraq Rejects U.N. Study Panels  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq today criticized the U.N. Security  
Council's decision to create study panels to assess Iraqi 
disarmament, humanitarian needs and the fate of missing Kuwaitis, 
calling it nothing more than ``procrastination.'' Iraq said the 
panels' work would take several months, serving only to ``maintain 
the unjust blockade.'' Iraq instead wants the Security Council to 
condemn U.S. and British aggression, including the mid-December 
airstrikes and the recent conflict over the ``no-fly'' zones. The 
government also called on the council to lift economic sanctions 
``immediately and unconditionally.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Prominent Ex-IRA Member Kidnapped  
</P>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- A prominent former IRA  
bombmaker who reportedly said he feared that his ex-comrades were 
after him was kidnapped today. Paddy Fox spent five years in prison 
after being caught with a 1,000-pound van bomb in 1991. He opposed 
a cease-fire decision by the Irish Republican Army in 1997 and 
rejected last year's Good Friday peace accord, which Sinn Fein 
politicians chose to accept. His abduction was apparently the 
latest in an accelerated campaign of IRA attacks on dissidents. The 
violence has increased fears that Northern Ireland's peace process 
could founder.

	US, India Complete Nuclear Talks  
</P>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- U.S. negotiators said no breakthrough  
was made in talks aimed at getting India to join a nuclear weapons 
treaty. The two sides promised to meet again before the middle of 
the year. Talks began earlier this year after India set off 
underground nuclear tests in May. Pakistan, with whom India has 
fought three wars since 1947, then conducted its own nuclear tests. 
The United States imposed economic and military sanctions on both 
nations and opened talks to persuade India to sign the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- The former husband of a woman allegedly  
killed by her jealous lover arrived in Greece today to take her 
mutilated remains back to New Jersey for burial. Timothy Nist is 
the ex-husband of Julie Scully, the former model whose Greek 
boyfriend, George Skiadopoulos, confessed to strangling, then 
burning and dismembering to try to hide the evidence. Skiadopoulos 
told authorities they had been arguing over her inability to adjust 
to life in his hometown.

	Falcons' Robinson To Play  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Pro Bowl safety Eugene Robinson of the Atlanta  
Falcons has been cleared to play in the Super Bowl tonight despite 
his arrest last night on sex solicitation charges. Falcons coach 
Dan Reeves said the team will not publicly address arrest, but he 
had no misgivings about allowing Robinson to play in the 
championship game against the Denver Broncos. The 36-year-old 
safety, who is married with two children, was charged with 
soliciting an undercover police officer for oral sex. Robinson is 
one of the unquestioned leaders of the team and has spoken 
frequently of his deep religious faith.

<HEADLINE> Trial a Boon for Lesser-Known Sens. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The flip side of the strict silence that  
senators must observe during President Clinton's impeachment trial 
is the substantial national television exposure they are getting 
whenever the proceedings are in recess. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been a particular bonanza for some of the lesser-known  
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Take freshman Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., for example. Unlike the  
better-known South Dakotan in the Senate, Minority Leader Tom 
Daschle, Johnson isn't accustomed to this kind of attention. 
</P>
<P>
	During a break in the impeachment trial, he does an interview  
with a CNN crew while reporters from National Public Radio, Fox 
News and the British Broadcasting Corp. line up to talk to him. 
ABC's ``Good Morning America'' wants to follow Johnson around for a 
day with a camera, and the cable network MSNBC has scheduled him on 
one of its news shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate backbenchers like Johnson are usually lucky to get one or  
two national TV appearances a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it does in some modest way increase my visibility in the  
Senate I think that enhances my ability down the road to pursue 
legislative goals,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Between Jan. 25 and 27, Republican Wayne Allard of Colorado,  
another first-term senator, appeared six times on cable talks 
shows, was interviewed several times by CNN, Fox, MSNBC and the BBC 
and was a guest on a Canadian morning news program. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers from the TV networks have besieged senators with  
invitations to appear on their talk shows. Senate aides say they 
typically get 20 to 30 requests a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox News Channel, CNN, MSNBC, CNBC and TV all have several daily  
shows for which they need guests. And then there are the major 
broadcast networks -- ABC, CBS and NBC as well as PBS. Sometimes a 
desperate booking agent will call the same Senate office more than 
once a day for the same show. ``It's overwhelming,'' said an aide 
to Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, as many as 21 senators have appeared on the  
Sunday news shows. Over a three-day period last week, CNN presented 
20 senators on three programs -- ``Larry King Live,'' ``Inside 
Politics'' and ``Crossfire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Inevitably when the spotlight shines that intently there are  
going to be people recognized that otherwise wouldn't'' be, said 
Joe Foote, a Southern Illinois University professor who studies 
media coverage of Congress. ``If you wanted to spring into a higher 
visibility bracket, this would certainly be the platform to do it 
in the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Gordon Smith, a Republican freshman from Oregon, decided to  
offer himself to the talk shows after he became angry watching 
NBC's ``Meet The Press'' one Sunday in December. The two guest 
senators seemed to Smith to be structuring a Clinton censure deal 
that would have bypassed a trial in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``One (show) led to another, to another, and now we're picking  
among options every day,'' Smith said. The exposure ``does elevate 
your stature among your colleagues and the influence of your voice 
in caucus meetings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some senators, including such first-term Republicans as Spencer  
Abraham of Michigan, Rod Grams of Minnesota and Rick Santorum of 
Pennsylvania, have turned down all or most media interviews. They 
face re-election in 2000 and say they want to be seen as impartial. 
</P>
<P>
	Some prominent Senate veterans, including Sens. Daniel Patrick  
Moynihan, D-N.Y., and Dick Lugar, R-Ind., also have avoided the 
camera. Lugar said ``it's not really helpful to try the case on 
television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there are more than two dozen senators who are regulars on  
the talk show circuit, sometimes appearing on more than one in the 
same day. The Sunday morning programs and Larry King get first 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., has been a guest of King's four  
times in a month. ``I'm not going to let some people have a voice 
and not have my own voice,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., has cut back on TV, fearing  
he was becoming too closely identified with the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not what I want the people of New Jersey to think  
about my term in the United States Senate,'' Torricelli said. ``I 
came here to work on education, tax reductions and environmental 
issues.''

<HEADLINE> Chicago Signs Forward Mario Bennett </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Mario Bennett, who started four games for the Los  
Angeles Lakers last season, was signed Sunday by the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett, a 6-foot-8 forward from Arizona State, averaged 3.9  
points and 2.8 rebounds in 41 games for the Lakers. He played in 19 
games for the Phoenix Suns as a rookie in 1995-96, then spent two 
seasons in the CBA. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning six championships in eight years, Chicago is going  
through one of the biggest rebuilding efforts in NBA history. 
Michael Jordan has retired, Scottie Pippen, Luc Longley and Steve 
Kerr were traded, Dennis Rodman is expected to sign elsewhere and 
former coach Phil Jackson is spending a season away from the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls have signed several free agents to one-year deals.  
They also signed guard Brent Barry to a six-year, $27 million deal, 
making him the cornerstone in the rebuilding plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago currently has 19 players on the its roster.

	MIAMI (AP) -- Darrien Gordon's two interceptions will put him in  
the Super Bowl history books. Getting tackled in the open field by 
Chris Chandler will put him in his teammates' doghouse.

<P>
	Gordon's second-half interceptions were returned for a record  
108 yards in Denver's 34-19 victory over the Atlanta Falcons on 
Sunday. The 5-foot-11, 190-pound cornerback also had two 
interceptions in the fourth quarter against the New York Jets in 
the AFC championship game two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gordon was a little disappointed that he didn't take  
Sunday's interceptions for touchdowns, especially because he was 
tackled by Chandler, the Falcons' quarterback, on the first one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took a shot to the head from Jamal Anderson in the first  
half, and I think that's why I lost my legs a little on the two 
returns,'' Gordon said. ``I think I was knocked out for a few 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family won't let me live it down that I was tackled by  
Chris Chandler, and my teammates will let me have it, too. I 
usually take those plays for touchdowns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to beat the quarterback in the open field,''  
defensive backfield teammate Tyrone Braxton said. ``We won't let 
him get a big head about the interceptions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon credited defensive tackle Keith Traylor with deflecting  
the pass from Chandler that Gordon picked off in the third quarter. 
He returned it 58 yards to turn back one of seven Atlanta drives 
inside the Denver 30 that led to just 12 points for the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were looking at the quarterback trying to get a good break  
on the ball, Traylor tipped it and I was able to get to the ball,'' 
Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon said he anticipated the Falcons' pass route on the second  
interception, that he returned 50 yards to stop another Falcons 
drive inside the 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``The route was the same one that (Kansas City's) Andre Rison  
beat us for a touchdown this season, and I was waiting for that 
one,'' Gordon said. ``I think the second one really took the life 
out of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two interceptions set single-game and career records for  
Super Bowl interception return yardage. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous records for a game and a career were 77 yards by  
Dallas' Larry Brown against Pittsburgh in 1996. Brown won the Super 
Bowl MVP for that performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta trailed 17-6 late in the third quarter and had a  
first-and-10 at the Denver 21 when Gordon caught the deflected pass 
and returned it 58 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The most interceptions in a Super Bowl game is three by Rod  
Martin of Oakland against Philadelphia in 1981. The longest 
interception return is 75 yards by Willie Brown of Oakland against 
Minnesota in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon said he was tired this week of hearing that the Broncos'  
secondary is the weak link of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teams down 30 points have to throw the ball 50 times, and that  
leads to a lot of 300-yard passing games,'' he said. ``The way our 
defense is set up, we try to stop the run and make the other team 
one-dimensional.''

<HEADLINE> GOP's Poll Ratings Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are lagging in the polls these  
days on issues ranging from trust over handling the nation's 
problems to their overall popularity as the Senate's GOP leaders 
press the impeachment case against President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But observers agree it is not as important how long the trial  
lasts as how effectively Republicans can change the subject back to 
the nation's business once the trial ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Political analyst Charles Cook, noting the time until the 2000  
election, saying: ``Two years is a long time, if you use it well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic strategists are heartened by polls that find nearly  
six out of 10 people disapprove of how Senate Republicans are 
handling the impeachment trial. Two-thirds of the public approve of 
the way Clinton is doing his job, according to several surveys. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, polls released over the weekend by The  
Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times and Newsweek magazine showed 
64 or 65 percent of respondents opposing the president's conviction 
and removal from office. The findings, which carried a margin of 
error of plus or minus 3 or 4 percentage points, are consistent 
with earlier polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps more troubling for Republicans is the Democratic  
advantage on handling of top issues. A recent Pew poll gave 
Democrats a marked lead over which party has the better ideas on 
such concerns as education, health care reform and Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats were the narrow choice regarding the global economy  
and even had a 45 percent-32 percent advantage in the traditionally 
strong GOP area of tax cuts for the middle class. Republicans won 
on morality. 
</P>
<P>
	The margin of error on the Pew poll of 1,200 adults, taken in  
mid-January, was plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton speaks of of such ``kitchen table'' issues as  
education, health care and Social Security in his State of the 
Union address and other speeches, Republican leaders face media 
questions about impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP spokesman Mike Collins said Republicans are moving ahead on  
other issues, even if the media are focusing only on the 
impeachment efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agenda is moving forward even as the trial goes forward,''  
Collins said. He cited the GOP push for a 10 percent tax cut, the 
party's plan to safeguard Social Security, proposals to improve the 
nation's schools and efforts to bolster national defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clinton has given us a scandal every 2 1/2 months,'' Collins  
said. ``I can't tell you we won't have any more investigations, 
because I don't know if President Clinton will do more that needs 
to be investigated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Republican push on policy issues, Columbia  
University historian Alan Brinkley said the public perception is 
that the GOP is obsessed with investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seems to be no gain for them in continuing this except  
within their own party,'' Brinkley said. ``This is how the party is 
defining itself for the next election. They're very likely to be 
remembered for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In exit polls taken during November's elections, disapproval of  
GOP handling of the Clinton investigation was not restricted to 
Democrats. One-third of Republicans did not approve of the probe 
and nearly two-thirds of independents were unhappy with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic pollster Mark Mellman compared the Republicans' drive  
to investigate to a drug addiction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Republicans are like crack cocaine addicts,'' he  
said. ``They know it's bad for them, but they can't help it. Their 
hatred for Bill Clinton is stronger than their instinct for 
survival.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most important thing for Republicans is to change the  
subject once the trial ends and effectively communicate their plans 
for the country, analyst Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should make a New Year's resolution: no more  
investigations,'' he said, but the key question is: ``Can they 
muzzle their attack dogs? 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans need to jump in with both feet on a range of  
issues,'' Cook said. ``One of those has to be taxes. That's the 
glue that holds the Republican Party together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also may be vulnerable as a result of the long-running  
scandal, including the Republicans' 39-27 advantage on the morality 
issue in the Pew poll. Disapproval of the Democrats' handling of 
the impeachment issue has grown in the last few weeks from 36 
percent (with 53 percent approving) to 45 percent (with 45 percent 
approving) in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Lydia Saad, managing editor of the Gallup Poll, said the  
Democrats' dropoff may be a sign that ``as these things drag on, 
they start to become a liability for everybody.''

<HEADLINE> NASA Spacecraft To Bring Back Comet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- For the first time since the Apollo  
moon landings, NASA is launching a mission into outer space to 
bring back extraterrestrial material. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, NASA is going after comet and interstellar dust.  
</P>
<P>
	Stardust, the robotic spacecraft that will collect the tiny  
grains, is due to lift off Feb. 6 on a journey that will span seven 
years and 3.2 billion miles. 
</P>
<P>
	It is NASA's first attempt to bring back pieces of a comet, in  
this case a comet that until the 1970s rarely ventured close to the 
sun and so still should contain the original, frozen components of 
the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
	By studying samples of the well-preserved Comet Wild-2,  
pronounced Vilt-2, scientists hope to better understand how icy, 
rocky comets may have provided the water and organics necessary for 
life to form on Earth -- and possibly elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``The study of comets is extremely important,'' says Carl  
Pilcher, NASA's science director for solar system exploration, 
``not only for understanding the origin of life on Earth but for 
understanding the biological potential of other planets, since the 
same comets that were hitting the Earth when the Earth was forming 
were probably also hitting Venus and Mars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If everything goes well -- a big if considering all the risks and  
uncertainties -- the $128 million Stardust will meet up with Comet 
Wild-2 on Jan. 2, 2004. The spacecraft already will have gathered 
interstellar dust while circling the sun en route to the comet. 
</P>
<P>
	Shielded in its most vulnerable areas, the 850-pound probe will  
fly between the comet nucleus and the sun, going through the 
comet's surrounding fuzzy cloud, called a coma. 
</P>
<P>
	Stardust will pass within 93 miles of Comet Wild-2, believed to  
be about 2 1/2 miles in diameter. Scientists say that's close enough 
to get good pictures and samples, yet hopefully far enough away to 
avoid being clobbered by large comet chunks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel the likelihood of this (collision) is very small,''  
says Stardust's chief scientist, Donald Brownlee, an astronomer at 
the University of Washington in Seattle. ``However, we are going 
into an unknown environment. No spacecraft has ever gone this close 
to a comet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists estimate it will take just minutes for Stardust to  
fly through the worst of the cometary hailstorm. The probe will 
speed by at a relatively modest 13,650 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	A navigation camera, peering at times through a periscope for  
protection, will photograph Comet Wild-2 during the final approach 
and actual flyby. At the same time, the dust-catcher, resembling an 
oversize tennis racket, will be exposed. It will pop out of 
Stardust's return capsule about 1 1/2 weeks before the spacecraft 
reaches the comet. 
</P>
<P>
	The dust-catching racket is covered on both sides with a pale  
blue glass foam called aerogel -- the latest in celestial flypaper. 
The extraordinarily light, porous silica material is ideal for the 
job, says Brownlee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wonderful thing about the aerogel is that ... it's  
beautifully transparent so we see these particles. We can find them 
inside,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep the aerogel free of earthly debris that might be  
mistaken for comet dust, NASA baked the return capsule for days and 
then purged it with nitrogen gas, a process still going on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's as pure as we can get it,'' says Rick Grammier, deputy  
project manager at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Once thousands if not millions of comet particles have been  
trapped in the aerogel, all in a matter of minutes, the racket will 
fold back down into the return capsule for the roundabout trip back 
to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	On one side of the racket will be the comet dust, quite possibly  
containing interstellar grains that were the building blocks for 
the solar system 4.6 billion years ago, thus the name Stardust. On 
the other side will be the much younger interstellar dust gathered 
by the spacecraft a few years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Touchdown is slated for Jan. 15, 2006.  
</P>
<P>
	The plan calls for the return capsule, containing the racket and  
embedded particles, to separate from Stardust at an altitude of 
69,000 miles and parachute into a military installation in the Utah 
desert. An onboard radio beacon will guide searchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The white-and-brown capsule -- 32 inches in diameter and shaped  
like an acorn -- will enter Earth's atmosphere at more than 28,000 
mph. That's 4,000 mph faster than the Apollo capsules that returned 
men from the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	In order for the capsule to survive the searing re-entry,  
engineers designed a lightweight heat shield made of 
phenolic-impregnated carbon. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has to hit the right entry corridor with the kind of  
accuracy that Michael Jordan makes on his best shots,'' says Joseph 
Vellinga, program manager for Lockheed Martin Corp., which built 
Stardust. ``We have to be precisely in the right location and at a 
very precise angle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASA will initiate ``a doomsday maneuver'' if the spacecraft is  
off course. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's doomsday only to the project because the spacecraft then  
goes on around in a solar orbit with the capsule still attached and 
we don't get the samples back,'' explains Vellinga. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA expects Stardust to bring back about 1 milligram of comet  
and interstellar particles -- not enough to fill a thimble. By 
contrast, the 12 Apollo moonwalkers hauled back 842 pounds of lunar 
rock and dirt from 1969 through 1972, the last celestial samples to 
be returned to Earth by NASA if you don't count microscopic 
particles brought back in space shuttle experiments. 
</P>
<P>
	For scientists, even the tiniest bit of pure comet dust will be  
a bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if we had a shovel full of this stuff, even if we had a  
bucket full, we would still be analyzing it at or near the atomic 
scale,'' says astronomer Brownlee. 
</P>
<P>
	The comet particles will not require any quarantine or special  
handling to protect the Earth against possible otherworldly germs. 
Comet dust falls harmlessly onto Earth all the time, scientists 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, they emphasize, the returned particles will be  
sterilized by the extreme heat generated when they bury into the 
Stardust aerogel. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Stardust is going first, solar wind particles collected  
by NASA's Genesis spacecraft will beat the comet samples back by 
three years. Genesis is to be launched in 2001, with a return date 
of 2003. NASA's big sample-return mission, to Mars, is targeted for 
launch in 2003 and 2005, with a 2008 delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Stardust and Genesis are part of NASA's Discovery program  
to explore the solar system at low cost. Stardust's $165 million 
price tag includes $37 million for mission operations; the tab 
climbs to about $200 million when adding in the Boeing rocket that 
will launch the spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA plans three more cometary missions over the next four  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just the beginning,'' says Brownlee.

<HEADLINE> Ignored Mayday Call Cost Four Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- In the black, rolling Atlantic lashed by  
a winter gale, Michael Cornett struggled to bring the Morning Dew, 
with his two sons and a nephew on board, into the safety of 
Charleston Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	But before dawn on Dec. 29, 1997, the 34-foot sailboat slammed  
into one of the harbor's rocky, protective jetties, which extend 2 1/2 
miles from shore, and tore a gaping hole in its fiberglass hull. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mayday. U.S. Coast Guard. Come in,'' a desperate voice  
crackled above the static. 
</P>
<P>
	But no search was launched. The Coast Guard says it couldn't  
tell where the call came from; the family's lawyer says they could 
have approximated the location. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornett's body and that of his 16-year-old son, Michael Paul,  
were later found in the water. His 13-year-old son, Daniel, and 
nephew Bobby Lee Hurd Jr., 14, were found unconscious the next 
morning on a nearby beach, and died a short time later; the two 
younger boys may have stayed on the wrecked boat or on the rocks 
until the rising tide sent them swimming for shore. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board wonders why help was  
not sent and will open a hearing here Wednesday. It also will 
examine the Coast Guard's response to a distress call from the 
clamming boat Adriatic that sank Jan. 18 off Barnegat Light, N.J. 
The crew of four is presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Libby Cornett of Hiltons, Va., also wants to know why no search  
was launched for her husband and the boys, and wonders if they 
could have been saved. 
</P>
<P>
	In the days after the wreck, she accepted it as a simple  
accident. It wasn't until later that she learned of the distress 
call. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before, it was easier to accept that perhaps it was an  
accident that happened so very quickly,'' she says. ``Now I know 
that's not what happened -- that they spent hours out there on those 
rocks seeing all the lights of Charleston ... hoping for help to 
come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cornett family filed a $35 million negligence claim; the  
Coast Guard rejected it, saying it was not legally required to 
launch a search. Family lawyer Gedney Howe plans to file suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is purely speculative that a search, even if launched,  
would have located the crew of the Morning Dew in time to save them 
from the frigid water,'' wrote Lt. Cmdr. J.C. Good, chief of the 
Coast Guard's claims and litigation branch. 
</P>
<P>
	Howe says the Coast Guard could have approximated the area where  
the radio call came from and a helicopter could have been there 
within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard Commandant James Loy ordered a review of how the  
service responds to distress calls. A report released just last 
week said that while many calls are unfounded, all should be 
considered legitimate until proved otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornett, 49, was a musician, music producer and doting father.  
Michael Paul wanted to study marine biology. Daniel wanted to study 
law. Bobby Lee, who lived in Mountain City, Tenn., loved baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``They loved hiking, rock climbing and cave spelunking. They  
raised emus, ostriches, pigmy goats and ferrets,'' Mrs. Cornett 
recalled. ``They were always going from one project to another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband and sons were strong swimmers, she said, and the  
family had sailed extensively around Florida and the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	On the day of the incident, Cornett had headed into the open  
ocean at Georgetown, about 60 miles northeast of Charleston. A 
storm was forecast, but small craft advisories for 6 feet seas were 
not expected until the following afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-hulled Morning Dew, a Cal-34, was designed for short  
hops close to the coast in good weather. Without a deep-water boat, 
sailors should ``stay off the ocean off Charleston in winter,'' 
said marina owner Ted Smith, who also has a Cal-34. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather quickly turned nasty, with 25 mph wind, and at 2:17  
a.m. a distress call sounded in the radio room of the Charleston 
Coast Guard Station. Mrs. Cornett later identified the voice as 
Daniel's. 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard petty officer returned the call but got no reply.  
</P>
<P>
	Five minutes later, another call. The petty officer couldn't  
make out a message, and got no answer to his response. 
</P>
<P>
	At 6:10 a.m., a crew member on a freighter heading into the  
harbor heard a cry for help from the water. The harbor pilots' boat 
was sent to look, but found no one. 
</P>
<P>
	The Morning Dew was dragged across the rocks and may have  
foundered for several hours before sinking, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rear Adm. Norman T. Saunders, commander of the 7th Coast Guard  
District in Miami who released the agency's report in June, refused 
to discuss responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the petty officer was temporarily suspended and  
required to requalify as a radio operator. The Coast Guard said it 
has installed $45,000 worth of new equipment at Charleston, making 
it easier for officers to replay unclear messages.

<HEADLINE> Scientists: AIDS Came From Chimps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Where did the AIDS virus come from? Scientists  
believe they have solved this lingering mystery. The answer: 
chimps. 
</P>
<P>
	In a presentation Sunday, researchers from the University of  
Alabama at Birmingham said they have convincing proof that the 
virus has spread on at least three separate occasions from 
chimpanzees to people in Africa. One of these cross-species 
transmissions was the start of the epidemic that now infects about 
35 million people worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Chimps, which have probably carried the virus for hundreds of  
thousands of years, apparently do not get sick from it. Figuring 
out why could be important. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is excellent science with biological and virological  
importance. If we understood how the chimp has dealt with this 
infection over time, that could have implications for human 
medicine,'' said Dr. Kevin DeCock, an AIDS expert at the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	While chimps have long been suspected as the source, ``there  
have been a lot of loose ends that made people uncomfortable 
drawing that conclusion,'' said Dr. Beatrice Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever its origins, HIV is a recent affliction of people. At  
last year's Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic 
Infections, Dr. David Ho and others from the Aaron Diamond AIDS 
Research Center at Rockefeller University presented evidence that 
the virus probably first infected humans in the 1940s or early 
'50s. 
</P>
<P>
	At the opening of this year's meeting, Hahn made the case that  
this event almost certainly occurred in west equatorial Africa when 
someone caught the virus from a chimp, perhaps after killing the 
animal for food. 
</P>
<P>
	Hahn said her team nailed down the connection by analyzing  
frozen tissue saved from a chimp named Marilyn that died from 
complications of childbirth at a U.S. Air Force primate center 14 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The chimp version of the AIDS virus -- the microbe now thought to  
be the grandfather of HIV -- is called SIVcpz. It is extremely rare 
among chimps in U.S. lab colonies, apparently because these animals 
are removed from the wild as babies and so are never exposed to the 
virus sexually. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, SIVcpz had been isolated only three times.  
</P>
<P>
	The fourth turned up when a colleague cleaning out a lab freezer  
ran across Marilyn's specimens and sent them to Hahn. Her team was 
able to perform various kinds of genetic analysis that were 
unavailable when the chimp died. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the Alabama team used molecular analysis techniques to  
study all four examples of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	They found that three of the four were genetically extremely  
similar to the human AIDS virus. They included one gene, called 
vpu, that also is part of HIV but not of other AIDS-like viruses 
that infect monkeys. 
</P>
<P>
	All three samples came from Pan troglodytes troglodytes, which  
is one of the four subspecies of chimp in Africa. These animals 
live in Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Congo and Central African 
Republic, the region where AIDS is thought to have started. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth sample, much less like HIV, came from another  
subspecies of chimp that is native to East Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Among humans, there are three major groups of HIV, code-named M,  
N and O. M is the variety that has spread around the world, while N 
and O are seen only in west-central Africa. The natural habitat of 
Pan troglodytes troglodytes exactly overlaps the area where these 
three groups were first recognized. The researchers believe that 
each group arose from a separate chimp-to-human transmission of 
SIVcpz. 
</P>
<P>
	``We conclude that this subspecies is the natural host and  
reservoir for HIV-1,'' the AIDS virus, said Hahn, whose work is 
also being published in this week's issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	She said a French team, headed by Dr. Phillippe Mauclere of the  
Pasteur Institute, recently found three more chimps infected with 
SIVcpz at a game sanctuary in Cameroon. One sample has been 
genetically analyzed and it, too, closely resembles HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	``That nails it,'' said Hahn. ``The only possible criticism is  
that we had made too much out of four animals.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: Most Oppose Tossing Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three new polls suggest a majority of  
Americans haven't changed their minds about impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as House prosecutors ready their interviews with Monica  
Lewinsky, and the Senate ponders how to end President Clinton's 
trial, weekend surveys by Newsweek, the Los Angeles Times and The 
Washington Post found that nearly two-thirds of Americans don't 
want the president removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	And a majority said they disapprove of the Senate's decision to  
hear new testimony from Ms. Lewinsky, presidential friend and 
adviser Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-five percent of those polled by the Los Angeles Times  
opposed a Senate vote to convict Clinton and remove him from 
office, against 29 percent who favored his removal. Newsweek, with 
65 percent to 28 percent, and The Washington Post, 64 percent to 33 
percent, mirrored the findings. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls have consistently found that roughly six in 10 Americans  
want Clinton to stay in office despite accusations that he tried to 
cover up an affair with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Senate's party-line vote last week to let  
impeachment prosecutors from the House take new testimony from the 
three witnesses, the Los Angeles Times said Americans, by a margin 
of 60 percent to 37 percent, felt that is unnecessary. Newsweek and 
the Post had similar, if less authoritative, findings of 48 percent 
to 47 percent, and 52 percent to 47 percent respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times survey also reported that by 59 percent to  
36 percent, Americans think congressional Republicans have put 
Clinton on trial primarily to hurt the Democratic president rather 
than in the interest of the nation's moral and legal well-being. 
</P>
<P>
	And Newsweek said 54 percent of Americans think the GOP has been  
hurt by the impeachment proceedings, against 9 percent who said the 
party was helped and 29 percent who say the GOP has not been 
affected by it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times poll questioned 960 adults across the  
country Jan. 27-29 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 
percentage points. The Newsweek poll surveyed 751 adults Jan. 28-29 
and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The 
Washington Post's poll was taken Jan. 28-30 and has a margin of 
plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Smith's Big Play Designed on the Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Denver Broncos have so much faith in their  
offense that they can design plays on the fly and turn them into 
gamebreakers. 
</P>
<P>
	That's precisely what they did on John Elway's 80-yard touchdown  
pass to Rod Smith late in the second quarter of Sunday's Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``That play wasn't even in the game plan,'' said Smith, who blew  
past safety Eugene Robinson to catch Elway's long pass, then sped 
to the end zone for the second-longest TD from scrimmage in Super 
Bowl history. ``We put it in on the sideline just before we did it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was going to be the first play out of the chute. It didn't  
matter when we got the ball, even if they scored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons didn't score as Morten Andersen missed a 26-yard  
field goal that could have made it 10-6. With the ball at the 20, 
it was time for the drawn-up play, dubbed ``Keeper X-Post.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The coaches upstairs saw some tendencies and called the  
play,'' Smith said. ``They said, `You can get open to the post.' 
The cornerback let me go and once I was on top of (Robinson), I 
knew I would beat him and the football would be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, the game's most valuable player it what might be his  
final NFL game, sent a perfect spiral that Smith caught in stride. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith finished the game with five receptions for 152 yards, a  
far cry from last year's performance, when he didn't catch a ball. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the finest way to complete a big year in which Smith led  
Denver with 86 catches for 1,222 yards. That he didn't make the Pro 
Bowl bothered him, although he admitted to being ``very happy'' 
that partner Ed McCaffrey was voted to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the best two receivers in the league, because we are  
the champs,'' he said. ``We do what a lot of other receivers on 
others teams won't do. We're blue collar guys on a blue collar 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith used the performances of other top receivers to inspire  
him Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the game, during the week, I took out my laptop and  
looked at the stats of the top receivers in the Super Bowl,'' he 
said. ``It motivated me to try to get to that level. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been blessed the last four years of my career,'' said  
Smith, an undrafted free agent from Missouri Southern in 1994. ``I 
was on the practice squad just trying to hold onto a job, then I 
went in in third-down situations, then got to be a starter. And 
now, two Super Bowls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which means the Broncos are a dynasty, according to Smith. And  
the rest of the NFL had better recognize it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever the other teams are, they still have to kiss our  
butts,'' he said, ``because we are the champs. And they have to 
kick our butts to get this, because we are the two-time champs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make a habit of this.''

<HEADLINE> 'VIP' Star Backs Animal Display Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Pamela Anderson Lee is speaking out against  
traveling animal exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
	A member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the  
former ``Baywatch'' star became angry after she was twice asked to 
pose with animals on display by television personality Jack Hanna 
at a New Orleans TV convention last week. She refused. 
</P>
<P>
	She was at the convention to promote her syndicated show  
``VIP.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a Jan. 27 letter to the National Association of Television  
Program Executives, she urged the organization to ban traveling 
animal acts in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Animals used in these types of sad displays are subjected to a  
constant barrage of handling and interaction with humans simply to 
provide 'entertainment,''' she wrote. ``Their constant confinement 
and handling is both physically and psychologically harmful. I 
refuse to be a party to their suffering.''

<HEADLINE> JonBenet Web Site Gets 10,000 Hits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- A Web site seeking information about a  
teddy bear found in the home where child beauty queen JonBenet 
Ramsey was killed has received more than 10,000 visits since it was 
put up by investigators last week. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Web site contacts about the bear, District  
Attorney Alex Hunter's office had received about 80 e-mails, 105 
phone calls and two personal contacts since the site opened 
Thursday, spokeswoman Suzanne Laurion said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	And a close match to the missing toy bear was given to the DA's  
office, Laurion said. 
</P>
<P>
	The search continues for the actual white bear, dressed in a red  
jacket, pants and Santa hat. Police photographed it in the Ramsey's 
home but did not take it as evidence and now it is missing. 
</P>
<P>
	It was first seen among the dead 6-year-old's toys, but family  
members have said it didn't belong to the girl who was found beaten 
and strangled on Dec. 26, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet's aunt, Pam Paugh, recently said a note was found in a  
pouch the bear had tied around its waist, but search warrants did 
not list any such note as evidence collected at the crime scene.

<HEADLINE> Gene Could Help Ease Menopause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Scientists have created a strain of mice whose  
ovarian tissue stays healthy with aging, avoiding the degeneration 
associated with menopause. The animals might give clues to helping 
women stay healthy after menopause. 
</P>
<P>
	Mice don't develop menopause as women do. But with aging, female  
mice lose their ovarian follicles, which are eggs plus surrounding 
support cells. Follicles produce the hormone estrogen before 
releasing the eggs, a process called ovulation. After ovulation, 
the support cells produce estrogen and progesterone. 
</P>
<P>
	In aging women, degeneration of the follicles triggers menopause  
by cutting estrogen production. Women take estrogen supplements 
after menopause to suppress symptoms like hot flashes and lower the 
risks of osteoporosis and heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	It's too early to speculate about whether scientists could  
extend ovarian life in women or what good that might do, said 
Jonathan Tilly, the senior author of the report in the February 
issue of the journal Nature Genetics. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists created the strain of mice by disabling a gene  
called Bax. The mice still had plenty of healthy follicles when 
examined well into old age. But they didn't ovulate and couldn't 
get pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	For human use, scientists would have to find a way to turn that  
gene off, and it's not clear yet whether that would be possible, 
said Tilly of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Wulf Utian, chairman of reproductive biology at Case Western  
Reserve University in Cleveland, who didn't participate in the 
study, called the results intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said one concern about human use would be the potential  
for increasing risk of breast and uterine cancers. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the body would continue to get estrogen without  
the monthly dose of the hormone progesterone that normally 
accompanies ovulation, he said. Progesterone keeps estrogen's 
effects in check, and women often take it or a chemical mimic along 
with estrogen supplements. 
</P>
<P>
	Tilly said the mice showed no sign of uterine or breast cancer.

<HEADLINE> A Bumper Crop of Stock Splits / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Take one look at the recent barrage of  
stock-split announcements from corporate America, and you know 
there's a bull market raging on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	In one three-day stretch last week, four of the business world's  
biggest names -- Microsoft, IBM, Xerox and McDonald's -- announced 
plans for 2-for-1 splits, and two star players in the Internet 
game, America Online and eBay, also said they would split 2 for 1. 
</P>
<P>
	This has been going on for some time now. As tallied by Standard  
&AMP; Poor's Corp., the number of stock splits of 3-for-2 or greater by 
New York Stock Exchange companies set a record of 235 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, even with the big selloff that hit the stock market  
between July and October, the total came to 224. And as of midweek 
last week, the January 1999 tally had already reached 35. 
</P>
<P>
	Splits can play a big part in the excitement of a flourishing  
market. But they can also confuse and mislead anyone who doesn't 
have a clear idea of what splits do, and do not, represent. 
</P>
<P>
	The first point to understand is that a split creates nothing in  
the way of new value or wealth. It merely cuts an existing pie into 
a greater number of pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	Suppose you own 100 shares of Hypothetical Industries, trading  
at around $80 a share, when Hypothetical declares a 2-for-1 split. 
You will receive another 100 shares, bringing your total to 200, 
but the stock will start trading at around $40 after the split. So 
your investment will still have the same total value, around 
$8,000. 
</P>
<P>
	What's the big deal, then? A quick Internet search turns up a  
dozen names of companies that study, track and predict stock 
splits, many of them offering to notify investors by pager or 
e-mail every time a new split is announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Splits, by long-standing tradition, are considered signals of  
confidence from the companies that declare them, and significant 
psychological boosts for the stocks involved. They are often 
accompanied by other bullish news from the same company, including 
perhaps an increase in the cash dividend. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, when Walgreen, the drug and general merchandise  
retailer, recently announced plans for a 2-for-1 split that is 
payable on Feb. 12, it also raised the cash dividend more than 8 
percent and said it plans to more than double the number of stores 
it operates by the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's, which will split 2-for-1 on March 5, accompanied  
that news last week with a dividend increase and one of its 
strongest quarterly earnings reports in quite a while. 
</P>
<P>
	In contexts like this, declarations of splits seem to serve as a  
kind of explanation point, emphasizing management's and directors' 
optimism about the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Wall Streeters also like the math of stock splits because  
they serve to keep a round lot of 100 shares reasonably affordable 
for individual investors. Hypothetical's 2-for-1 split described 
above, for instance, effectively means that the minimum ante to buy 
its shares in round lots is reduced from $8,000 to $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors prefer to deal in multiples of 100 shares, rather  
than so-called odd lots, because they can usually get more 
favorable prices that way when they buy and sell. 
</P>
<P>
	It also has to be said that splits can serve an important  
psychological purpose by making stocks seem less forbidding to buy 
after they have enjoyed a big runup. If you remembered a time when 
Hypothetical used to trade around $10 a share, you might be 
reluctant to buy it for $80. 
</P>
<P>
	But after a split, with the shares knocked down in price to $40,  
it's easier for a would-be buyer not to be so mindful of the fact 
that the stock has already had a 700 percent move.

<HEADLINE> Sharpe Misses Game With Hurt Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Shannon Sharpe ended up not having a lot to say in  
the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver tight end twisted his left knee in the first quarter  
of the Super Bowl and, after appearing briefly later in the 
quarter, was out for the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe was hurt when he was hit on his knee and flipped over by  
cornerback Ray Buchanan's tackle on a 14-yard reception to the 
Atlanta 1. Howard Griffith scored on the next play, giving the 
Broncos a 7-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe, who caught 64 passes for 768 yards and 10 touchdowns  
this season and was voted to his seventh straight Pro Bowl, limped 
off the field after his catch. He returned later in the quarter but 
had a pass bounce off his shoulder pads, and cornerback Ronnie 
Bradford intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe, whose outspoken commentary was a highlight of pre-Super  
Bowl media interviews, went to the locker room at the end of the 
quarter to have his knee retaped but was ruled out of any more 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sore,'' said Sharpe, who nonetheless was able to limp  
into the interview area without assistance wearing a styrofoam 
horse's head with Broncos insignia. 
</P>
<P>
	``On that play, I bounced around Eugene (safety Eugene  
Robinson), and I could see Buchanan coming up. I thought I would 
try to go over the top of him, but his helmet caught my knee before 
I got off the ground. He got my knee pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was undetermined whether Sharpe might require surgery.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Fans Proud Despite Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Falcons fans lined up outside area bars before  
they opened Sunday to stake out prime seats for the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	It took them just a few minutes to clear out after the Falcons  
lost to the Denver Broncos 34-19. 
</P>
<P>
	But regardless of the loss, most of the fans were proud of their  
team, which made the Super Bowl for the first time in its 33-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	They were also mindful of next year -- when the NFL championship  
game will be in Atlanta's Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hurt for them. No matter what, I'm still a Falcons fan,''  
said Larkin Gates, one of about 1,500 people who crowded into the 
Three Dollar Cafe in Buckhead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be up there next year. I'll be doing the Dirty Bird for  
them,'' said Gates, who had a Falcon tattooed on chest, with a 
Falcons throw worn like a cape and an Atlanta bandanna in his hair. 
</P>
<P>
	There were few people doing the Dirty Bird -- a prancing dance  
performed by Falcons players after big plays -- following John 
Elway's methodical attack against the Atlanta defense that earned 
him MVP honors in Denver's second straight Super Bowl victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still love my Dirty Birds,'' said Jimmy Moon, a cook at  
Reggie's British Pub at the CNN Center in downtown Atlanta. ``They 
lost tonight, but they'll be back next year. I've been with them 33 
years and I'm not giving up now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dirty Birds, as the team became known during their race to  
the NFC championship, captured admiration statewide. 
</P>
<P>
	The Three Dollar Cafe in Atlanta opened at 11 a.m., said manager  
Samantha Lockridge. By midafternoon, it was standing room only. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates, a longtime Falcons fan, shook hands with friend Grant  
Donlay when he realized the game was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys got it man. You guys got it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Donlay, one of the few Denver fans in the throng, wore a Broncos  
ball cap, but wisely remained quiet for most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're both championship teams,'' he said after the Denver  
win. ``The two best teams win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Heggy, wearing a helmet with a Bronco rising from the  
front, put the hat in a bag in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``This way, I can walk out without an altercation,'' Heggy said.  
``The team with the most experience won. Denver lost four before 
they won one. You've got to lose some before you win one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Atlanta Police command center in Buckhead, where officers  
had prepared to deal with a rowdy outdoor celebration if the 
Falcons had won, little activity was reported after the game ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very quiet. Nobody is doing anything they're not supposed  
to do. We expect people will be going home now,'' said Maj. Bill 
Gordon. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ganong Eyes Future Super-G Wins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Megan Ganong's name will be on the start list  
for the opening event of the World Alpine Ski Championships, yet 
there's not a chance in the world that she'll get a medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganong, one of the young American speed skiers, is a forerunner  
for Monday's women's super-G, the opening event of the two-week ski 
circus at Vail and Beaver Creek resorts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganong obviously would rather be in the starting field chasing a  
medal, but she says she'll gain a lot from her assigned role that 
could help her in future championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gets me excited, to see what it's all about,'' the  
19-year-old racer said. ``You see it on TV and hear about it, but 
being here is a whole different feeling. It motivates me to get to 
this level. This is where all that dryland training pays off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forerunners get little if any attention on race day. The crowd  
is waiting for the competition to begin and the forerunners serve 
only as a warm-up act. Only a few insiders remember that 1984 
Olympic downhill champion Bill Johnson was a forerunner in the 1980 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Forerunners play an important if overlooked role. While others  
were grabbing some lunch, Ganong's gang blasted down Vail's 
International race trail, testing as only a racer can how well the 
mountain crew did its job. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to make sure it's a good course that's going to run  
good, because it's a big deal tomorrow,'' Ganong said. ``It's fun 
to be a part of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vail's done a great job preparing this hill. I've never skied  
down this hill before but just going up the chair this morning and 
looking at it, it was so buffed and the fences are all up. It's 
neat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's a benefit to being a forerunner, Ganong added.  
</P>
<P>
	``An advantage is being able to radio up to our girls who are  
competing and let them know how it's running,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on her experience racing the course on Sunday, what would  
she tell her teammates? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a hill where you have to stay ahead of it, be looking  
ahead and be really active with your legs because there's so much 
terrain,'' she said. ``There's nowhere where it's really super 
steep, but there's one traverse in the middle where it's icy and 
you have to stand on your ski hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess they watered it down and it's a little bumpy, and as  
you're coming across you can lose your (edge on the) outside ski 
and can get low'' heading into the next gate. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganong and the other forerunners involved in this event are  
looking forward to competing in the 2001 World Championships in 
Austria and the 2002 Winter Olympics at Salt Lake City 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the younger racers and this is super training for us,''  
she said. ``It's so hard to get good speed training, as far as 
safety is concerned. In the middle of the year, to get a training 
camp like this, it's great. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have anything else going on right now, so if I wasn't  
here I'd probably be at home (Olympic Valley, Calif.) training. 
This is far better.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Senators Seen Favoring Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican senators on Sunday said some of  
their colleagues may vote against removing President Clinton from 
office. House prosecutors, meanwhile, prepared to question Monica 
Lewinsky in a last-ditch effort to strengthen their case. 
</P>
<P>
	As Lewinsky waited at the Mayflower Hotel for her deposition  
Monday, cracks appeared in the unified Republican front on the 
perjury and obstruction charges against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sense right now in just listening to members talk is that  
there are Republicans who either are not going to vote for perjury 
or the obstruction of justice'' charge, Sen. Tim Hutchinson, 
R-Ark., said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson declined to estimate how many might vote to acquit,  
but he indicated that getting even 50 votes for conviction in a 
chamber controlled by 55 Republican senators is in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would much closer to getting a majority in the obstruction  
(charge) than on the perjury charge'' and the case now stands, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors have shifted their focus to the obstruction  
charge on the assumption that even among Republicans who believe 
that Clinton lied under oath, there is questionable support for the 
notion that the untruths were serious enough to warrant the 
president's removal, according to a knowledgeable official who 
demanded anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, two of the three witnesses prosecutors will  
question this week -- presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White 
House aide Sydney Blumenthal -- go to the obstruction question, 
rather than the perjury charge. 
</P>
<P>
	And sources close to the committee have said that Rep. Ed Bryant  
of Tennessee, who will question Ms. Lewinsky, wants to elicit 
information on Clinton's efforts to conceal their affair from Paula 
Jones' lawyers and Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	But even as senators widely believe they don't have the 67 votes  
needed to remove him from office, Clinton's battles are far from 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr is considering seeking the president's indictment before  
Clinton's term expires. A legal source, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said Sunday that Starr's view ``for some time'' has been 
that a sitting president is indictable. 
</P>
<P>
	Bipartisanship showed a glimmer of life again as the White House  
and senators of both parties expressed dismay at a report about 
Starr's thinking in The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is just no end to what this man is willing to do to  
continue to pursue the president,'' said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's unfortunate because it gets in the way or our  
focus on what our constitutional obligation is,'' said Sen. Mike 
DeWine, R-Ohio, on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's most immediate concern is the final chapters of  
the Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators on the Sunday talk shows showed other signs of cracks  
in the GOP's unity that muscled through Republican plans last week 
to continue the trial and call witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' how many Republicans would  
vote to convict Clinton on the perjury charge, Shelby, R-Ala. 
replied: ``Not as many as a lot of people believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't polled anybody, but I hear a lot of people say that  
is the weakest'' of the two charges. He added that the charge would 
draw ``perhaps'' fewer than 50 votes for conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``A number of senators who believe that the president lied under  
oath but that his wrongdoing in that area does not constitute 
perjury because of the legal definition of perjury,'' said Sen. 
Susan Collins, R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	One prospective presidential candidate issued a stern warning  
from conservative circles to Republicans up for re-election next 
year who vote against the articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senators who vote to acquit just naturally will end up facing  
primary challengers,'' conservative activist Gary Bauer said on 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with conviction apparently beyond reach, senators continued  
to search for ways stop Clinton from walking away unpunished from 
the second impeachment trial in history. 
</P>
<P>
	A Republican proposal to pass a ``finding of fact'' that would  
state that Clinton lied under oath and impeded justice crossed 
party lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Budget Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., pushed for the  
plan as a way to ``make the record clear for history and posterity 
that we have indeed not let this go unintended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal drew support from one of Clinton's biggest  
supporters on policy and harshest critics of the president's 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``I for one would be hard-pressed to vote against it,'' Sen.  
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But other Republicans and Democrats still objected to the  
political cover such a proposal would grant to senators who vote to 
acquit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to either convict the president and kick him out of  
office or we ought to acquit him,'' Shelby said. ``This looks to me 
like somebody is trying to get around the Constitution, trying to 
have it both ways.''

<HEADLINE> Scientists: AIDS Came From Chimps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Where did the AIDS virus come from? Scientists  
believe they have solved this lingering mystery. The answer: 
chimps. 
</P>
<P>
	In a presentation Sunday, researchers from the University of  
Alabama at Birmingham said they have convincing proof that the 
virus has spread on at least three separate occasions from 
chimpanzees to people in Africa. One of these cross-species 
transmissions was the start of the epidemic that now infects about 
35 million people worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Chimps, which have probably carried the virus for hundreds of  
thousands of years, apparently do not get sick from it. Figuring 
out why could be important. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is excellent science with biological and virological  
importance. If we understood how the chimp has dealt with this 
infection over time, that could have implications for human 
medicine,'' said Dr. Kevin DeCock, an AIDS expert at the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	While chimps have long been suspected as the source, ``there  
have been a lot of loose ends that made people uncomfortable 
drawing that conclusion,'' said Dr. Beatrice Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever its origins, HIV is a recent affliction of people. At  
last year's Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic 
Infections, Dr. David Ho and others from the Aaron Diamond AIDS 
Research Center at Rockefeller University presented evidence that 
the virus probably first infected humans in the 1940s or early 
'50s. 
</P>
<P>
	At the opening of this year's meeting, Hahn made the case that  
this event almost certainly occurred in west equatorial Africa when 
someone caught the virus from a chimp, perhaps after killing the 
animal for food. 
</P>
<P>
	Hahn said her team nailed down the connection by analyzing  
frozen tissue saved from a chimp named Marilyn that died from 
complications of childbirth at a U.S. Air Force primate center 14 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The chimp version of the AIDS virus -- the microbe now thought to  
be the grandfather of HIV -- is called SIVcpz. It is extremely rare 
among chimps in U.S. lab colonies, apparently because these animals 
are removed from the wild as babies and so are never exposed to the 
virus sexually. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, SIVcpz had been isolated only three times.  
</P>
<P>
	The fourth turned up when a colleague cleaning out a lab freezer  
ran across Marilyn's specimens and sent them to Hahn. Her team was 
able to perform various kinds of genetic analysis that were 
unavailable when the chimp died. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the Alabama team used molecular analysis techniques to  
study all four examples of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	They found that three of the four were genetically extremely  
similar to the human AIDS virus. They included one gene, called 
vpu, that also is part of HIV but not of other AIDS-like viruses 
that infect monkeys. 
</P>
<P>
	All three samples came from Pan troglodytes troglodytes, which  
is one of the four subspecies of chimp in Africa. These animals 
live in Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Congo and Central African 
Republic, the region where AIDS is thought to have started. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth sample, much less like HIV, came from another  
subspecies of chimp that is native to East Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Among humans, there are three major groups of HIV, code-named M,  
N and O. M is the variety that has spread around the world, while N 
and O are seen only in west-central Africa. The natural habitat of 
Pan troglodytes troglodytes exactly overlaps the area where these 
three groups were first recognized. The researchers believe that 
each group arose from a separate chimp-to-human transmission of 
SIVcpz. 
</P>
<P>
	``We conclude that this subspecies is the natural host and  
reservoir for HIV-1,'' the AIDS virus, said Hahn, whose work is 
also being published in this week's issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	She said a French team, headed by Dr. Phillippe Mauclere of the  
Pasteur Institute, recently found three more chimps infected with 
SIVcpz at a game sanctuary in Cameroon. One sample has been 
genetically analyzed and it, too, closely resembles HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	``That nails it,'' said Hahn. ``The only possible criticism is  
that we had made too much out of four animals.''

	Broncos Win 2nd Straight Super Bowl  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Denver Broncos beat the Atlanta Falcons 34-19  
Sunday in Super Bowl XXXIII as John Elway got his second straight 
Super Bowl ring. Elway, the unanimous choice for MVP, completed 18 
of 29 passes for 336 yards and one touchdown and ran 3 yards for 
another score. The total yardage was third best in Super Bowl 
history. Terrell Davis, the league MVP, carried 25 times for 102 
yards for his seventh consecutive postseason 100-yard game, 
breaking an NFL record set by John Riggins.

	GOP Unsure of Impeachment Votes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican senators Sunday questioned whether  
they had enough votes to remove President Clinton from office, as 
Monica Lewinsky waited at a Washington hotel for her deposition 
Monday. Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., indicated that getting even 50 
votes for conviction in a chamber controlled by 55 Republican 
senators is in doubt. House prosecutors have shifted their focus to 
the obstruction charge on the assumption that even among 
Republicans who believe that Clinton lied under oath, there is 
questionable support for the notion that the untruths were serious 
enough to warrant the president's removal, one official said. 

</P>
<P>
	Most Want Clinton To Stay in Office  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most Americans don't want President Clinton  
removed from office, according to three new polls. Weekend surveys 
by Newsweek, the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post also 
found that a majority of Americans said they disapprove of the 
Senate's decision to hear new testimony from Monica Lewinsky, 
Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal. Polls have consistently found 
that roughly six in 10 Americans want Clinton to stay in office 
despite accusations that he tried to cover up an affair with Ms. 
Lewinsky.

<P>
	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Thirteen people have died and hundreds  
remain trapped in their cars, after snowstorms and cold weather hit 
Rominia this weekend. Army and police working through the night 
rescued about 2,000 people caught in storms on the roads in 
northeastern Romania. Heavy snowfall began early yesterday and 
parts of northeastern Romania were blanketed by more than 6 feet of 
snow. Winds reached more than 60 mph, the Bucharest weather service 
said.

	Rare Blue Moon Rises  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A blue moon rose Sunday, and another blue moon will  
be coming on the night of March 31. Two blue moons in one year 
happens every 20 to 40 years. The last time was in 1961. The term 
``blue moon'' refers to the occasional occurrence of two full moons 
in the same month, which usually happens roughly once every 33 
months. The last full moon was Jan. 2. The second full moon in a 
month is called a blue moon, regardless of tint. Astronomers 
predict the next occurrence of two blue moons in one year will be 
in 2018, on Jan. 31 and March 31, and again on the same dates in 
2037.

governor regarded as one of Virginia's greatest leaders of the 
century for his work to modernize the education system, died at age 
84. Godwin, elected as a Democrat in 1965 and as a Republican in 
1973, was praised Sunday by leaders of both parties for 
transforming the once largely rural state with a community college 
system and a state sales tax for school improvements.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Anheuser-Busch Inc., the Super Bowl's biggest  
advertiser, stuffed the telecast with critters on Sunday while 
others used celebrities to get their messages across during TV's 
highest profile show. Anheuser-Busch ran nine commercials during 
the Super Bowl, consuming more than five minutes of the 28 minutes 
of ad time sold in the game. The Fox TV network said it averaged 
$1.6 million for each half-minute ad. The network expected 130 
million viewers nationwide. The World Wrestling Federation used 
some of its own stars, while Lingerie retailer Victoria's Secret 
showed off skimpily clad models.

	Crowds Gassed in Denver After Game  
</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Police used tear gas Sunday night to disperse  
crowds downtown after Denver Broncos fans spilled into the streets 
to celebrate a second straight Super Bowl victory. In Lower 
Downtown, bars emptied as the game ended and fans started bonfires 
and set off firecrackers in Larimer Square. When the estimated 
crowd of 1,000 would not disperse, police threw tear gas canisters 
and marched down Larimer Street in riot gear, pounding their 
shields with their clubs.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Sees Cell-Phone Price War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Telecommunication regulators have frowned on an  
escalating price war between the city-state's two mobile phone 
operators that has delighted cellular users, The Sunday Times 
reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Government-linked Singapore Telecommunications and private  
challenger MobileOne engaged in a tit-for-tat fight over rates on 
Friday, with a total of three reductions announced in the course of 
just five hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest round of cuts could save Singapore's 1 million  
subscribers more than $112 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Telecommunications Authority of Singapore is not  
pleased, said the paper. Permission for all such rate cuts must 
first be approved, and the mobile phone operators may have acted 
too quickly and might be misleading the public, said the government 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	``Service providers are required to file tariff proposals with  
TAS for prior approval before announcements and implementation,'' 
spokeswoman Dolce Chan was quoted as saying. ``TAS may take 
appropriate regulatory action of operators fail to comply with this 
requirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MobileOne, owned by Britain's Cable and Wireless, Hong Kong  
Telecom and local partners Singapore Press Holdings and Keppel 
Group, had not yet received permission for their reductions, said 
the authority. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulatory body was unhappy with Singapore Telecom too,  
accusing it of potentially misleading the public because it did not 
clarify that the initial offer was valid only until the end of 
March 2000, when a third cellular operator enters the market. 
</P>
<P>
	MobileOne had promised its 300,000 subscribers a 50 percent  
reduction in charges from 9 p.m. to 9 a.m., and 12 free seconds on 
each call, just two hours after SingTel announced a similar deal 
for its 700,000 users. 
</P>
<P>
	Later that evening, SingTel upped the ante by offering its  
customers of more than two years an additional reduction of 40 
percent off subscription charges.

<HEADLINE> Robinson Apologizes to Family, Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- After a Super Bowl that went terribly wrong, Eugene  
Robinson lingered in the Atlanta Falcons training room, getting 
treatment for a broken finger. 
</P>
<P>
	His once-sterling reputation will take a lot longer to heal.  
</P>
<P>
	A night after being arrested on a downtown street and charged  
with soliciting an undercover police officer for oral sex, Robinson 
faced a horde of media following Atlanta's 34-19 loss to the Denver 
Broncos on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Declaring his innocence and saying he couldn't comment on the  
details of the case on advice of his lawyer, Robinson also 
apologized to his family and to the entire Falcons organization 
``for this very, very low point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just trying to be extremely real,'' he said, diverting  
from a statement he prepared for the news conference. ``This is 
something I thought about; I had a lot of times to think about it. 
Quite frankly, I got no sleep. I had a lot of time to think about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the arrest, Falcons coach Dan Reeves allowed Robinson to  
start Sunday night against the Denver Broncos, the first NFL 
championship game in Atlanta's 33-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons lost 34-19, with Robinson burned on the game's  
biggest play -- an 80-yard TD pass to Rod Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the lack of sleep, Robinson said, ``I was extremely  
focused on the game today. It didn't affect my play because it was 
pretty much therapeutic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His bubbly, infectious leadership was a major reason the Atlanta  
Falcons reached their first Super Bowl. His strong religious 
beliefs, usually espoused in sermonlike fashion, seemed to make him 
a role model in this era of misbehaving athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe it ... anybody but Eugene,'' linebacker Henri  
Crockett said before the game in the lobby of his team's hotel. ``I 
know what kind of person he is. There has to be something more to 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson warmed up as normal before the game, stopping to shake  
hands with head linesman Sanford Rivers. He also hugged teammates 
Ray Buchanan and Travis Hall in between drills. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons defense took the field for the first time just over  
five minutes into the game, and Robinson broke up Denver's first 
play: a pass from John Elway that was intended for Terrell Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was beaten by Smith down the middle of the field on the  
long touchdown pass, giving the Broncos a 17-3 lead late in the 
first half. In the third quarter, Robinson broke his left pinkie 
trying to tackle Terrell Davis, limiting his effectiveness the rest 
of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was more concerned about those around him -- especially  
his family. He and his wife, Gia, have an 11-year-old daughter, 
Brittany, and a 9-year-old son, Brandon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ramifications are far-reaching,'' Robinson said. ``You  
have no idea of the gravity of the situation as I see it and how 
it's going to affect people. A good friend of mine said, 
`Confession is good for the soul, but bad for the reputation.' It 
is so true. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reputation, I can deal with that. But my wife, that means much  
more to me. I truly love my wife. I love my kids. I'm sorry that I 
had to drag them through that type of deal. I'm sorry that it even 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Robinson was arrested at 9 p.m. Saturday on Biscayne  
Boulevard, a major street frequented by prostitutes and drug 
dealers. He was driving alone in a rented car when he offered an 
undercover officer $40 for oral sex, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The misdemeanor charge carries a maximum sentence of 60 days in  
jail, but most first-time offenders are offered some combination of 
community service, attending a course on the dangers of 
solicitation and a fine, said police spokesman Angel Calzadilla. 
The car was impounded and will cost $1,000 to retrieve. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five people were arrested in the undercover operation,  
including a suspect in three killings in Pennsylvania, Calzadilla 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Saturday, Robinson was honored with the Bart Starr Award  
by the religious group Athletes in Action. Balloting is conducted 
among NFL players to select the person who displays ``high moral 
character.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, who suffered his fourth Super Bowl loss as a head coach,  
said he didn't think Robinson's arrest cost the Falcons a chance to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a little distracting, but I don't think it was a major  
factor,'' he said. ``My major concern was whether he was going to 
be ready to play, and he said he was. I thought he did a good job. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a member of our family. We love him unconditionally.  
Nobody is more embarrassed than Eugene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was released from Miami police headquarters around 11  
p.m. to Falcons general manager Harold Richardson. The player 
promised to return for a court appearance, which is usually 
scheduled within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	After being released, Robinson was consoled in his hotel room by  
several teammates, including Buchanan and linebacker Cornelius 
Bennett, according to his father, Samuel Robinson, who also was in 
the room. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't say anything about what happened, and I didn't ask  
him,'' the father said. ``But you could see he was crushed. I've 
never seen my son with that look of concern and disappointment in 
his entire life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett spent more than a month in jail during the last  
offseason after pleading guilty to sexual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bennett has been there before,'' Samuel Robinson said. ``I'm  
glad he was there to support Eugene. He let him know, `We're here 
for you as a team.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who played in the last two Super Bowls with Green Bay,  
is the NFL's career leader among active players with 53 
interceptions, including four this season. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed with the Falcons as a free agent and became the  
unquestioned leader of the secondary, earning Pro Bowl honors and 
bringing a winning attitude to a franchise that was used to losing. 
All week, he wore his 1997 Super Bowl ring to inspire his 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest is yet one more difficult side issue this season for  
the Falcons, following Reeves' heart bypass surgery in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had all kinds of opportunities,'' safety William White  
said. ``You can't fault no one but the person who's looking at you 
in the mirror.''

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Farmers' Future Jeopardized / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HOLLAND, Pa. (AP) -- After 20 years, Dennis Hess is about  
ready to kick the tobacco habit. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking to rebound from a disastrous 1998, Hess and more than  
500 Pennsylvania tobacco growers formed a cooperative. They hoped 
their collective strength would gain them better prices at 
Lancaster County's first-ever farmer-owned auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, prices have gotten worse as demand for tobacco drops.  
That is making growers like Hess, 47, of New Holland, think twice 
about planting a new crop next year. His 10 acres of tobacco 
already have dwindled to four over the past several years and now 
he is considering planting sweet corn and pumpkins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not sell at this price,'' said Hess, who also helps run  
the auction at a warehouse in New Holland. 
</P>
<P>
	A pound of tobacco sold for about 55 cents on Friday; a pound  
sold for about $1.04 when the auction first opened Jan. 13. Hess 
and other members of the Pennsylvania Tobacco Marketing Association 
had hoped to get at least $1.25 a pound when they formed the 
cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got bales sitting at home already from last year's  
crop,'' Hess said. ``If this keeps up, I'm not going to grow 
tobacco next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As auction manager, Hess goes around with the auctioneer and the  
tobacco buyers as they sift through rows of tobacco bales stacked 
three and four high. Those that get bid on are given a white tag. 
If a farmer rejects the bid, he replaces the white tag with a red 
tag. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first two weeks of this nearly seven-week auction,  
there have been a lot of red tags. 
</P>
<P>
	That means growers will either take a chance that prices will go  
up the next auction day or pull their crop off the block and hope 
their luck changes next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't afford to do that, but they can't afford to take  
these prices either,'' said co-op organizer Jane Balmer, who helped 
get 3 million pounds pledged to the auction. 
</P>
<P>
	She grows 10 acres of tobacco at her Mount Joy farm, much of  
which is waiting to be sold. Ms. Balmer also still has a wagon-full 
of unsold tobacco bales from last year's crop sitting in a barn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never expected these kinds of prices,'' she said. ``There's  
a lot of people here who are saying, `I'm not going to do this 
anymore,' or 'I'm going to cut my acreage in half.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty years ago, Pennsylvania farmers harvested about 30,000  
acres of tobacco. That number is down to about 7,000 today and will 
continue to decrease as prices plummet, Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower supply and demand, coupled with the lesser quality of this  
year's crop, are the main reasons for the low auction bids, said 
farmer Gene Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 38, sold the tobacco he grew on his New Holland farm  
without the co-op's help in early December for about $1.25 per 
pound. It costs about $1 to grow a pound of tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	With his crop sold, he helped buyer Golden Leaf Co. of  
Kingsville, Va., mark the quality of tobacco at the auction Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sold early because I was undecided if I really wanted to  
join the co-op,'' Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania owns just a small slice of the national tobacco  
market. The state's crop is valued at about $25 million, compared, 
for example, with Tennessee's $200 million harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Bigger tobacco states like North Carolina, which grows 300,000  
acres, also are facing similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're really left scratching their heads,'' said Russell  
Redding, Pennsylvania's deputy secretary of agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the co-op and auction will continue in New Holland.  
</P>
<P>
	``With prices this low, I'm hoping that buyers begin tripping  
over themselves to get in here,'' Hess said.

<HEADLINE> Shanahan, Reeves Exchange Few Words </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan insisted he  
wasn't ready to consider a third straight Super Bowl title Sunday 
night, but his words gave himself away a few moments later. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our offseason program starts tomorrow,'' Shanahan said, barely  
20 minutes after the Broncos had won their second consecutive 
championship with an easy 34-19 victory over the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	Always thinking ahead. Typical behavior from somebody renowned  
for his meticulous preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
	It's that kind of attention to detail that has allowed the  
45-year-old rising star to negotiate his way through the pitfalls 
that stand in the way of any defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos not only came through virtually unscathed, they came  
back even better. They won their first 13 games, lost two, then won 
the final four to lift the trophy once again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we better? I really don't know,'' Shanahan said. ``It's so  
hard to judge. Over the past two years, everybody believed. The 
more pressure we had on this football team, the more they stepped 
up. That's what wins championships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not even the potential of an ugly family feud could distract the  
Broncos this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta coach Dan Reeves, who spent 10 years coaching the  
Broncos, let slip two weeks ago that his wounds haven't healed 
completely from his firing in Denver six years ago. One of the 
protagonists, he said, was Shanahan. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves said Shanahan and quarterback John Elway conspired to run  
their own game plan and blamed Shanahan for not telling him about 
Elway's unhappiness with the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan reacted angrily at first, then calmed back down and  
said he would take the high road. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue died quickly in Miami, and the two exchanged a brief --  
very brief -- handshake after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just said, `Congratulations.' I said the same thing to  
him,'' Shanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan became the sixth coach to win back-to-back Super Bowls  
and first from the AFC in nearly 20 years, when Chuck Noll's 
Pittsburgh Steelers won in 1979 and 1980. Other coaches to win two 
in a row are Vince Lombardi, Don Shula, Bill Walsh and Jimmy 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos also set a record by winning their 45th game over  
the past three seasons, breaking a tie with Walsh's San Francisco 
49ers from 1988-90. Denver's 33rd win over two seasons also set a 
record, breaking ties with the 1972-73 Dolphins and 1989-90 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos owner Pat Bowlen called this year the ``greatest season  
in Bronco history,'' pointing to Denver's 17-2 record and Super 
Bowl win. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan, though, wasn't ready to put any of that into  
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're always week-to-week in this profession,'' he said.  
``I'm just going to enjoy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But not for very long. After all, it was Shanahan's emphasis on  
the Broncos' offseason program that laid the groundwork for this 
season's dominating run. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some dedicated guys,'' he said. ``They know what it  
takes to get to the next level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preparation begins next week.

<HEADLINE> Sunday Special: First Falcon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- When Tommy Nobis arrived at his first NFL training  
camp with the Atlanta Falcons, he wasn't quite prepared for what he 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the No. 1 overall draft choice in 1966, an All-American  
linebacker at Texas who was featured on the cover of Life magazine. 
Expansion Atlanta proudly picked him to become the first Falcon. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobis had turned down the AFL Houston Oilers, who offered more  
money, because he always wanted to play in the NFL. He was wined 
and dined during the signing wars, escorted for a whirlwind tour of 
New York by his NFL ``baby-sitter,'' ex-quarterback Eddie LeBaron. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were flying first-class with a limousine at my disposal,  
going to shows,'' he said. ``It was pretty good stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And then came training camp.  
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons chose a YMCA camp, the Blue Ridge Assembly in Black  
Mountain, N.C., to assemble their first team. The place looked like 
Times Square at rush hour with 130 players rattling around. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a church retreat with no setup for a football team,''  
Nobis said. ``There was not the TV money and revenues in the league 
then that there are today. They found the best deal they could get. 
There were makeshift showers and makeshift meeting rooms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that was the good part.  
</P>
<P>
	The bad part came when the Falcons had to leave Black Mountain.  
</P>
<P>
	To get to the airport, the team used three old Greyhound buses,  
one of them without a roof. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coach, Norb Hecker, made everybody wear coats and ties,''  
Nobis said. ``The rookies had to ride in the bus without the 
roof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a one-hour trip over the back roads of North Carolina, the  
roofless bus left the rookies covered with dust and grime. And that 
included the fancy first Falcon, who by then was wondering just 
what he had gotten himself into. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't just the Falcons,'' Nobis said. ``George Halas and  
the other old owners were still operating in a spartan mode. Their 
feeling was they didn't want to make it too nice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The toughest part was coming out of a big-time program at  
Texas where everything was done first-class and now I'm on a bus 
without a roof. At the All-Star game in Chicago before camp, we 
dressed in a gymnasium and hung our clothes on a nail. The NFL was 
supposed to be the next step up. It was almost a little bit of a 
step down. We didn't even have a workout room for the offseason. 
You had to join a YMCA or a health club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was the losing.  
</P>
<P>
	The NFL was not exactly generous in stocking expansion teams  
back then. The Falcons came away with a sad-sack roster, doomed to 
failure. Even a training camp visit from the Rev. Billy Graham, who 
lived near Black Mountain, did not help. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 1-4 preseason, the Falcons lost nine straight games.  
Then they marched into Yankee Stadium and beat the New York Giants 
27-16. They won two more games, finishing 3-11. Nobis was defensive 
rookie of the year and made the Pro Bowl from a team that gave up 
437 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first year, there were a lot of difficult, tough times,''  
Nobis said. ``It was what you anticipate from any new franchise. 
But it still was very exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Nobis could never have anticipated was how long the bad  
times would last. He played 11 seasons and only twice did his teams 
win more games than they lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``You couldn't think of getting out of contracts then,'' he  
said. ``Your options were clear cut. You either played or you got 
out of it. There were times when I thought about the options I had. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many people were a part of this thing. It was frustrating  
for all of us. That was a natural reaction. All you could do was 
put it behind you and prepare for the next season. It was not 
easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Nobis retired, the first Falcon was invited to stay with  
the team, which will play in its first Super Bowl on Sunday. He is 
now Atlanta's vice president for corporate development -- the 
longtime linebacker turned into a marketing man. 
</P>
<P>
	His job description is open-ended, and includes training camp  
site selection. He is unlikely to be looking over any church 
retreats, especially in Black Mountain.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Quotes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Quotes from Super Bowl players and coaches:  
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't look at myself as similar to Michael Jordan. He had  
six championships. Mine doesn't compare with that situation. But I 
always thought it would be nice to go on top like he did, and that 
means win the Super Bowl.'' -- Broncos quarterback John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know. This definitely throws a kink into it. This is  
what I came back for, to enjoy the Super Bowl. I'm going to savor 
this.'' -- Elway on his retirement decision. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if this was John's last game or not. If you're  
going to go out, what a way to go out! There's a bunch of guys in 
there trying to talk to him about a threepeat.'' -- Broncos coach 
Mike Shanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought John Elway was a great quarterback when he lost  
three Super Bowls. I'm sure this put a smile one put a smile on his 
face.'' -- Falcons coach Dan Reeves said of his former quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	``They all hurt when you come in and lose. I guess I'm just  
fortunate to be here. You go through that, and you get here, well, 
who knows what your chances are?'' -- Reeves after losing his fourth 
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Reputation, I can deal with that. But my wife, that means much  
more to me. I truly love my wife. I love my kids. I'm sorry that I 
had to drag them through that type of deal. I'm sorry that it even 
happened.'' -- Falcons safety Eugene Robinson one day after being 
arrested on charges of soliciting sex from an undercover 
policewoman. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate that dance. We just wanted to make sure they didn't  
have any chance to do the Dirty Bird. They can't do it if they 
can't score touchdowns and they didn't do that until we were way 
ahead.'' -- Broncos cornerback Darrien Gordon, who intercepted two 
passes and set a record with 108 interception return yards. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	``My family won't let me live it down that I was tackled by  
Chris Chandler, and my teammates will let me have it, too. I 
usually take those plays for touchdowns.'' -- Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the game, during the week, I took out my laptop and  
looked at the stats of the top receivers in the Super Bowl. It 
motivated me to try to get to that level.'' -- Broncos wide receiver 
Rod Smith said after catching five passes for 152 yards, including 
an 80-yard TD reception. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of a strange game. We established that we could  
move the ball. We just couldn't put six points on the board 
consistently.'' -- Falcons wide receiver Tim Dwight.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Sees Cell-Phone Price War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Telecommunication regulators have frowned on an  
escalating price war between the city-state's two mobile phone 
operators that has delighted cellular users, The Sunday Times 
reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Government-linked Singapore Telecommunications and private  
challenger MobileOne engaged in a tit-for-tat fight over rates on 
Friday, with a total of three reductions announced in the course of 
just five hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest round of cuts could save Singapore's 1 million  
subscribers more than $112 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Telecommunications Authority of Singapore is not  
pleased, said the paper. Permission for all such rate cuts must 
first be approved, and the mobile phone operators may have acted 
too quickly and might be misleading the public, said the government 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	``Service providers are required to file tariff proposals with  
TAS for prior approval before announcements and implementation,'' 
spokeswoman Dolce Chan was quoted as saying. ``TAS may take 
appropriate regulatory action of operators fail to comply with this 
requirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MobileOne, owned by Britain's Cable and Wireless, Hong Kong  
Telecom and local partners Singapore Press Holdings and Keppel 
Group, had not yet received permission for their reductions, said 
the authority. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulatory body was unhappy with Singapore Telecom too,  
accusing it of potentially misleading the public because it did not 
clarify that the initial offer was valid only until the end of 
March 2000, when a third cellular operator enters the market. 
</P>
<P>
	MobileOne had promised its 300,000 subscribers a 50 percent  
reduction in charges from 9 p.m. to 9 a.m., and 12 free seconds on 
each call, just two hours after SingTel announced a similar deal 
for its 700,000 users. 
</P>
<P>
	Later that evening, SingTel upped the ante by offering its  
customers of more than two years an additional reduction of 40 
percent off subscription charges.

<HEADLINE> Blind Man Says Sight Was Burden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- When doctors restored Shirl Jennings' sight,  
his comfortable world of darkness was suddenly filled with fear and 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	Used to seeing nothing, suddenly seeing everything was too much  
of a shock. Images appeared but he didn't know what they were 
without touching or smelling them. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacking any experience of depth perception, walking down the  
sidewalk became a frightening journey where even his own shadow 
confused him. He tripped over curbs, stumbled over things in his 
way and couldn't walk up stairs. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't understand facial expressions, and when he tried to go  
back to work as a masseur, the body parts beneath his fingers began 
to disgust him. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennings, whose story inspired the movie ``At First Sight,'' had  
no visual memory when he regained his sight at age 51. The 
experimental surgery fixed his eyes, but his mind didn't know how 
to interpret the images that were flooding his senses. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of the blessing he was expecting, seeing became a  
daunting task. Sometimes he would just close his eyes to black out 
all the images that were overwhelming his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to go through so many adjustments,'' said Jennings, now  
58 and living in this Atlanta suburb. ``I could never figure out 
what I was looking at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the nearly eight years since the surgery restored the vision  
he lost as a young child, Jennings' eyesight has deteriorated to 
the point where he can only make out some shapes and distinguish 
between light and dark. 
</P>
<P>
	But that doesn't bother him.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's really more easy to be blind than see,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The movie, which opened last month, stars Val Kilmer as Jennings  
and Mira Sorvino as his wife, Barbara. The Jennings met with the 
cast before shooting began. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mira said I gave her one of the best massages she ever had,''  
Jennings said, instructing his wife to pull out the photo of him 
rubbing the actress' shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	As a child growing up in the Blue Ridge Mountains near Montvale,  
Va., Jennings contracted polio, meningitis and cat-scratch fever. 
After lapsing into a coma, doctors gave up hope for the 3-year-old 
boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``They sent me home to die but I'm still living,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He left the hospital paralyzed from the waist down and with his  
eyesight fading. But Jennings' mother, Pearl Layman of Roanoke, 
Va., nursed him back to health. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really worked with him. I didn't give up hope,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	With her help and that of his cousins, Jennings learned how to  
walk and talk again. But they couldn't help his deteriorating 
eyesight. Soon, the young boy could only differentiate between 
light and dark. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 6, Jennings went to the state institution for the deaf  
and blind. He then studied massage therapy and eventually took a 
job as a masseur at the YMCA in DeKalb County, near Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where he met Barbara. They had a few dates but she  
married someone else and moved to Vermont. In 1988, Jennings found 
out that Barbara had divorced and returned to the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty years went by in a matter of minutes,'' Mrs. Jennings  
recalled about their reunion. ``It was as if we had just seen each 
other the day before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About three months later, they married. But before they walked  
down the aisle, Mrs. Jennings asked her fiance to see her family 
ophthalmologist, Dr. Trevor Woodhams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured I didn't have too much to lose,'' Jennings said.  
</P>
<P>
	There have been fewer than a dozen cases of long-term blindness  
being reversed, but Mrs. Jennings thought it was strange that 
Jennings was able to distinguish between light and dark. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodhams determined that Jennings had dense cataracts but that  
both of his retinas were intact. Woodhams suggested surgically 
removing Jennings' cataracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The cataract from one of Jennings' eye was removed in September  
1991 and the second eye was operated on about a month later. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they removed the patch from his eye, he was very, very  
quiet -- unnaturally so,'' Mrs. Jennings said. 
</P>
<P>
	He could see, but he didn't know what he was seeing. Jennings  
couldn't distinguish between a table or chair without touching them 
and couldn't identify an apple or orange without smelling them. 
</P>
<P>
	And months after his surgery, as he was learning to handle  
sight, Jennings developed pneumonia and his eyesight began 
deteriorating again. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Jennings wears dark sunglasses to protect against  
ultraviolet rays that began damaging his retinas after the 
cataracts were removed. 
</P>
<P>
	He says he appreciates his short flirtation with sight. He  
learned to paint -- mostly landscapes, seascapes and abstracts -- a 
hobby he keeps up. He made frequent trips to the Georgia coast, 
where he would watch the freighters cruise down the river. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could see the boats in the Savannah River, I could see  
trains come by. At Tybee (Island), I could see the Spanish moss in 
the trees,'' he said, then smiled. 
</P>
<P>
	And despite all the problems, Jennings said he would do it all  
over again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm such an optimist.''

<HEADLINE> Ads Crowd Skies Over Super Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- At the Super Bowl, all the sky's a billboard.  
</P>
<P>
	The airspace above Pro Player Stadium became a huge rotating  
advertising display Sunday, with a half-dozen or more flying 
promotions in view at any one time. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans could gaze up and find aircraft touting three brands of  
beer, two auto dealers, local restaurants, office products, auto 
insurance, sporting goods, the Florida Lotto, upcoming records and 
the Dilbert television show. About the only product missing was 
Burma Shave. 
</P>
<P>
	And that was two hours before the game.  
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly is quite busy now,'' Federal Aviation  
Administration spokeswoman Tanya Wagner said 90 minutes before 
kickoff. ``In the last hour we've handled 80 operations -- takeoffs 
and landings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner was one of a half-dozen people manning a small control  
tower atop the northeast corner of the stadium, the first time the 
FAA has handled flight operations on-site. 
</P>
<P>
	Five controllers gazed out the windows of the 8x10 tower, using  
two-way radios and binoculars to guide the constant stream of 
airplanes and blimps passing by against the pastel-blue backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
	Some had nothing to do with advertising, instead proclaiming  
political or religious messages. 
</P>
<P>
	A plane dragging a Heineken banner was followed by one  
proclaiming ``The winner is Jesus.'' Then came a banner for 
1-Jobs.com, one promoting Bud Light, and one that read: ``Fire the 
lying felon.'' The names of President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky 
were left off in favor of another Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, planes were flying at two different altitudes,  
giving the ads a double-deck effect. Blimps flew at an even higher 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been open since 10 this morning, and we'll be open until  
midnight,'' Wagner said. ``We're estimating between 600 and 800 
operations today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tower also is directing dozens of helicopter landings at two  
pads on the stadium's north side. That's become the preferred mode 
of travel for celebrities and corporate VIPs. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA has previously created temporary control towers for  
events such as the Masters golf tournament, but they were located 
at nearby airports. For other Super Bowls in Miami, the control 
center was Miami International Airport, some 20 miles south of Pro 
Player Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL officials approached the agency about eight months ago with  
the suggestion that the tower be located at the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it was a great idea and jumped on it,'' Wagner  
said. ``In the past, the local air traffic controller wasn't always 
able to see everything above the stadium. This time they can see 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About two dozen seats were torn out of the upper deck to make  
room for the temporary tower. The $6,000 cost for construction and 
operations was picked up by the NFL.

<HEADLINE>  Crowds Gassed in Denver After Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Police used tear gas Sunday night to disperse  
crowds downtown after Denver Broncos fans spilled into the streets 
to celebrate a second straight Super Bowl victory. 
</P>
<P>
	In Lower Downtown, bars emptied as the game ended and fans  
started bonfires and set off firecrackers in Larimer Square. When 
the estimated crowd of 1,000 would not disperse, police threw tear 
gas canisters and marched down Larimer Street in riot gear, 
pounding their shields with their clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans scurried away in the smoke, rubbing their eyes.  
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't give us any time,'' said John Giomin of Denver.  
``This really hurts. This really hurts. I've never been gassed 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police issued warnings to the crowd before the tear gas was  
used. But Jeff Sherwood, 29, who moved to Denver two years ago from 
Burlington, Iowa, said he and his friends were caught off guard by 
the police response. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came down right after the game,'' he said. ``I walked up  
next to a policeman. He said, `Do you think you are safe?' Then 
they tear-gassed us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, officers on horseback kept crowds in check.  
</P>
<P>
	At several spots downtown, people waved special editions of the  
Denver Rocky Mountain News and The Denver Post, climbed poles and 
waved pennants. 
</P>
<P>
	As the game ended, police blocked access into downtown from  
Interstate 25, which runs through the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Downtown bars were havens of orange and blue Sunday as the  
Broncos took on the Atlanta Falcons. After Denver's 34-19 win, many 
brought their drinks and celebrations outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, about 30,000 people gathered downtown after the  
Broncos beat the Green Bay Packers in the Super Bowl. There were 
more than 25 arrests and 50 people were overcome by tear gas after 
violence broke out in Larimer Square. 
</P>
<P>
	Police deployed tear gas after people smashed shop windows,  
overturned cars and set fires. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, police had promised a swift response, including tear  
gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have said they believe a relatively small number of  
people were responsible for last year's problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most law-abiding people found the people that were doing that  
pretty disgusting,'' city spokesman Andrew Hudson said. ``It's 
idiotic. It's that kind of behavior that is going to get people 
hurt and get people arrested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police had a chance to test their postgame security plans after  
the Broncos won the AFC championship two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bill Owens, in Miami for the game, said he will return for  
a parade and rally Monday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Betting the Favorite Worked Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Jason Elam was still trying to keep the  
football from blowing off the tee for the opening kickoff Sunday 
and already a few gamblers were tearing up betting slips. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take long to separate some bettors from some of their  
Super Bowl money. Not when they had bet on Denver receiving the 
opening kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who bet the Broncos to win, though, fared much better in  
the biggest game of the year for wagering. 
</P>
<P>
	Long lines formed at most of the city's sports books just after  
the game, with those holding winning tickets happily waiting for 
their payoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of happy folks in here,'' said Vince Magliulo,  
sports book director at Caesars Palace. ``People have to win 
sometimes and we understand that. We'll probably end up paying out 
more money than we took in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The annual betting feast featured its usual share of winners and  
losers as gamblers packed sports books to wager on everything from 
the first player to score to how many passes John Elway would 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of dollars changed hands -- mostly in the form of crisp  
$100 bills -- in what might have been the most heavily bet Super 
Bowl yet. Last year, a record $77.3 million was bet legally on the 
game, with millions more wagered illegally around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a record handle here and I would think most everybody  
else did too,'' Magliulo said. ``We were packed in here all day 
long and we were still packed after the game with people cashing 
tickets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oddsmakers reported heavy two-way action on the game, which  
featured a 7 1/2-point spread that stayed pretty constant in the two 
weeks of betting leading up to the opening kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
	But the late wave of betting was almost all on the Broncos, and  
they were winning bets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall it looks like a small loser for the sports books,''  
said Cesar Robaina, odds manager for Las Vegas Sports Consultants, 
which sets the odds at most major casinos. ``Most of the books 
needed the Falcons to cover the spread to win money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A final late touchdown by Atlanta that was meaningless in the  
final outcome of the game proved very meaningful. The late betting 
had pushed the over-under on the total score from 53 to 51 1/2-points, 
allowing bookies to win many late wagers by bettors who thought the 
game would be low scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Oddsmakers had opened the game two weeks ago at a total of 53  
points -- exactly where it ended up. 
</P>
<P>
	Books that got heavy early betting on the over, though, ended up  
losing some bets on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got middled on the total, but that happens,'' Magliulo  
said. ``It just makes for happy bettors around here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Imperial Palace sports book, where so-called proposition  
bets are a specialty, bettors still had a chance to root late into 
the game even if they were backing the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports book supervisor Jackson Meeker said more than 100  
different propositions made it the biggest betting day ever at the 
Strip resort. 
</P>
<P>
	``People love those things,'' Meeker said. ``They were lining up  
to bet them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the bets crossed sports, including a wager that matched  
Phil Mickelson's score in the fourth round of the Phoenix Open 
against receiving yards by Ed McCaffrey. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson ended up shooting 80 on Sunday, while McCaffrey  
finished with 72 yards -- proving once again that oddsmakers can get 
these things pretty close. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettors who had a little extra cash in their pockets after  
cashing winning tickets had a chance to let it ride once again. 
</P>
<P>
	At Caesars, bettors could wager on whether the NFC or AFC team  
wins the Super Bowl next year (with the NFC a 2-point favorite). 
</P>
<P>
	Or, they could put money down on the favorite to win next year's  
Super Bowl. Surprisingly enough, it's not the Broncos (7-1) but the 
Minnesota Vikings, who are the 6-1 favorite.

<HEADLINE> Sonics To Start Owens Over Hawkins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The man in the middle will be new. So,  
apparently, will Gary Payton's backcourt mate. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Westphal, who replaced George Karl as Seattle SuperSonics'  
coach, probably will go with free agent addition Billy Owens as his 
starting shooting guard this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Westphal likes the 6-foot-9 Owens' size -- and versatility.  
Owens, signed along with former Sacramento teammate Olden Polynice 
after the NBA lockout, also can play small forward and point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens is expected to make his starting debut Friday night when  
the Sonics open their season at home against Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Westphal used what he called his ``big'' lineup -- Owens, Payton,  
Polynice, Detlef Schrempf and Vin Baker -- in Seattle's exhibition 
finale Saturday night against Vancouver. The Sonics beat the 
Grizzlies 80-68. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the big lineup, we have tough matchups at every  
position,'' Westphal said. ``In the past, teams have tried to put 
the point guard on Hawk (6-3 Hersey Hawkins) and the big guard on 
Gary. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they try that with Billy, he'll punish them. You can't  
guard him with a point guard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westphal said that Hawkins' departure from the starting lineup  
isn't a demotion, merely a better utilization of his personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I don't start Hawk, he'll be out there on the floor at the  
end of every game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawkins has the NBA's longest current starting streak, 461  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess that would end it, wouldn't it?'' Hawkins said,  
smiling.

<HEADLINE> Levy Considers Reeves' Frustrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	 *Marv Levy, who coached the Buffalo Bills to four straight Super  
Bowls and lost all four games, analyzed Sunday's game between the	
Denver Broncos and Atlanta Falcons for the Associated Press.	
</P>
<P>
                            *By MARV LEVY    	
</P>
<P>
	Myself and Bud Grant are the only men in the world who know  
exactly how Dan Reeves feels. 
</P>
<P>
	And believe me, it's a miserable feeling.  
</P>
<P>
	I walked off the field at the Super Bowl four times without ever  
knowing what it's like to win the game, and each time you can't 
believe the feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	You go in with high hopes and relish the idea, and you never  
think you won't win. And then, all of the sudden, you've been 
defeated and don't know if you'll ever get back. 
</P>
<P>
	I know what a terrible feeling it is. There's no feeling of  
despair I ever had that impacted me like losing those games. You 
bounce back after a couple of weeks, but at that moment you feel 
worse that you ever have. 
</P>
<P>
	I felt worse after losing those games than I did after losing my  
job in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	What I saw were five reasons why Denver won the game:  
</P>
<P>
	-- It went according to form in that the best team won. There was  
no question about that. The Broncos were stronger, and it was 
obvious they were the better all-around football team. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Atlanta's one chance was to win the turnover game, and it  
didn't. Not even close. One of the things often missed when 
discussing turnovers is what happens after you get one. Atlanta got 
the first one but did nothing -- missed a field goal. Denver did 
something with its turnovers. Atlanta was plus-20 on turnovers 
during the regular season and the Broncos were plus-12 in the 
playoffs. So that was biggest thing that did not go according to 
form, and Denver exploited it to the hilt. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Denver was vastly superior on pass defense to anything I  
expected. I thought they were suspect at the corners, but Darrien 
Gordon came up with two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Denver's uncanny ability to get that early lead. That's what  
helped it get the turnovers later, and that's made Atlanta play as 
though it was desperate. 
</P>
<P>
	-- When Atlanta committed to stopping the run, the Broncos didn't  
go after the corners, they went after the soft middle. The Falcons 
had their linebackers closer to the line, and they were stepping 
forward with every run fake. That made them vulnerable to quick 
passes over the middle, which John Elway employed with great 
effect. And trying to stop Terrell Davis left the Falcons open to 
the biggest play of the game, that 80-yard bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	I'll never know exactly how Mike Shanahan felt, but I can offer  
some insight into what Reeves' next few days will look like. 
</P>
<P>
	What we did with the Bills was like a five-step program:  
</P>
<P>
	-- We mourned for about 10 days. I'd just be miserable, lay in  
bed and pound the pillow and scare my wife. 
</P>
<P>
	-- We'd own up to what happened, look at where we are and how we  
can improve. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Recognize the good. If I'm Reeves, I look at the way we came  
back in the Minnesota game, and I'd look at how we handled this 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Form a plan, decide what we're going to do about it. You can't  
just keep lying there in a fetal position. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Act. You don't just form a plan, you go out and do the hard  
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	It'll be tough for Reeves in the month ahead. It's hard to go  
out to dinner, because people come up to console you and you don't 
even want to hear about it. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a tendency to want to become reclusive, but you can't do  
that. You eventually have to get back to work.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Turgeon Back on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Despite problems with her agent, difficulties  
with her coaches and an untimely back injury, Canada's Melanie 
Turgeon always remained optimistic. Turns out she had reason to be. 
</P>
<P>
	Turgeon, still trying to recover from bulging discs in her back,  
has made steady progress on the World Cup circuit this season, 
recording two top-10 finishes in the downhill and super-G. 
</P>
<P>
	She hopes for another breakthrough today in the women's super-G,  
the opening event of the World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I finish fifth here, I'll be ecstatic,'' Turgeon said  
Saturday after completing her training runs on Vail Mountain. 
``I'll be living on a little cloud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once considered Canada's next great all-around skier, the  
22-year-old Turgeon saw her future grow cloudy when, as a 
teen-ager, she struggled to cultivate a strong relationship with 
her agent and failed to see eye to eye with her coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Those obstacles behind her, Turgeon's focus returned to skiing --  
until her bulging back flared up last fall, preventing her from 
getting comfortable in a racing tuck. 
</P>
<P>
	Turgeon, who stands 46th in the World Cup standings, has not  
skied a slalom race since July, and she painfully removed herself 
from the super-G at Mammoth, Calif., on Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had three possibilities: Go home and just get ready for the  
World Championships or go home until after Christmas and then do a 
couple World Cups and then come to the World Championships,'' 
Turgeon said before revealing the final scenario. 
</P>
<P>
	``I almost put an end to my season in Mammoth, but we said, `OK,  
we'll give it a try. We'll go to Europe and follow the circuit, and 
when I'm ready, I'll just race.' We came from very far and managed 
to get some really good results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results have included four top-15 finishes, including a  
seventh-place finish in the downhill at Veysonnaz, Switzerland, 
Dec. 19, and a sixth-place performance in the super-G at Cortina 
d'Ampezzo, Italy, last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm around a second out every race, and last year I was around  
two seconds out, so I've improved,'' she said. ``Instead of being 
around 20th place, I'm around 10th place. It's moving along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though not among the favorites in Vail, Turgeon likes the  
women's International super-G course, which is a good sign. She 
also had warm feelings about Cortina. 
</P>
<P>
	``In '95, I won a training run here, but then I hurt myself on  
the jump and I couldn't race,'' Turgeon said. ``I had an 11th place 
here in World Cup Finals two years ago. I also had some bad 
performances, but I don't talk about those.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such banter would be inconsistent with Turgeon's cheerful  
personality, which helps her maintain an unwavering confidence in 
the face of adversity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting there,'' she said. ``I'm still young. I'm only  
22.''

<HEADLINE> Women Have Majority in Wash. Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- The surest sign that women have arrived as  
powerbrokers in the Washington state Senate? They took over the 
biggest bathroom off the Senate chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	The women are still chuckling over that little power play, made  
possible by their 2-to-1 majority in the Democratic caucus. They've 
also nailed down just about every Senate leadership and committee 
post. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate, a male bastion for most of the state's history, is  
closing in on an even split with 23 women among the 49 members. And 
the House has 37 women among the 98 seats, giving Washington state 
the country's highest percentage of female lawmakers -- 41 percent, 
with 60 of 147 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Sid Snyder jokes about being one of the  
token males in the Democratic caucus, which has 18 women and nine 
men. 
</P>
<P>
	Women say they'll improve the tone of debate and produce more  
family-centered legislation, dealing with schools and traffic jams 
and other down-home concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	No more good ol' boys and talking issues to death, they say.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're just nervier,'' says state Rep. Ida Ballasiotes.  
</P>
<P>
	Women from both parties and both houses recently announced a  
``women-led economic agenda'' and posed by a photo montage of the 
House membership of a century earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lot of facial hair there,'' state Rep. Mary Lou  
Dickerson said of the picture. ``All men. What a difference a 
century makes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The national average for female legislators is 22 percent,  
according to the Center for the American Woman and Politics at 
Rutgers University. Other states in the Top 10, with women making 
up roughly a third of their lawmakers, are Nevada, Arizona, 
Colorado, Kansas, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Maryland and 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama, which has less than 8 percent female legislators, is at  
the other end of the scale with Oklahoma, Kentucky, South Carolina 
and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides installing the nation's highest percentage of female  
legislators, Washington voters in November re-elected Patty Murray 
to the U.S. Senate -- over a female opponent -- and gave the state 
three female Supreme Court justices, a third of the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's executive branch has women as attorney general,  
school chief, land commissioner and insurance commissioner -- all 
elected posts. Attorney General Christine Gregoire was the broker 
of last year's multibillion-dollar settlement between the states 
and the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Washington, it's not a novelty,'' says Cathy Allen, vice  
chairwoman of the National Women's Political Caucus and a Seattle 
political consultant. ``We became accustomed very early on to 
voting for the gutsy, entrepreneurial women who were role models in 
government, business and the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, however, is the first in the nation to have an  
all-female elected line of succession: governor, secretary of 
state, attorney general, treasurer and superintendent of public 
instruction. They were all sworn in by U.S. Supreme Court Justice 
Sandra Day O'Connor, an Arizonan who was the first woman appointed 
to the nation's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington women head key committees in both legislative houses  
this session and hold many leadership posts, including the floor 
leadership positions for both parties in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their gains, state Sen. Darlene Fairley still sees  
vestiges of sexism. Some male lawmakers, she said, still talk about 
the ``girls'' taking over and ``gripe, gripe, gripe'' when the 
women assert themselves.

<HEADLINE> Wallace, Team Finds Key to Ferrari </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Andy Wallace was faced with an  
intriguing dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
	Just over two hours were left in the 37th Rolex 24 at Daytona  
International Speedway and the Englishman -- co-driving with 
team-owner Rob Dyson, Elliott Forbes-Robinson and Butch Leitzinger 
-- was piloting the Riley &AMP; Scott Mark III Ford that was leading the 
premier sports car race in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-place Ferrari 333SP was just over two laps behind on  
the 3.56-mile, 11-turn road course -- not a comfortable cushion for 
the leaders with so much time left in an endurance event. 
</P>
<P>
	Of more concern, rain was pouring into the open-cockpit Can-Am  
car, soaking Wallace and, worse, his radio. 
</P>
<P>
	``The water got to the radio, so I didn't know how fast I was  
going or how fast everybody else was going,'' Wallace explained. 
``I just had to look at what other cars were doing and decide when 
it was a good time to come in and get rid of the wet tires and put 
on slicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw the Ferrari coming out of the pits on slicks and I just  
decided I'd wait and see if he'd blow by me. When that happened, I 
knew it was time to come in and make a change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace made his stop with just over one hour left to go, giving  
up the cockpit to Leitzinger, who drove the red, white and blue car 
to the end of the 24-hour event and beat the Ferrari by one lap and 
1 minute, 55.69 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a frustrating loss for the runners-up, since they lost  
three laps just after dawn Sunday because of a jammed brake rotor. 
</P>
<P>
	``That brake problem cost us the race,'' said Wayne Taylor, who  
combined with Allan McNish of Scotland, Max Angelelli of Italy and 
Didier de Radigues of Belgium in the Ferrari. ``It cost us three 
laps, and we could never make them up. The rain just made it too 
difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a matter of luck,'' Daytona rookie Angelelli said  
with a shrug. ``It was fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a hard race,'' said Forbes-Robinson, like Wallace a  
three-time winner in the Rolex 24. ``We had competition the whole 
way. That Ferrari was fast and dangerous. We had to keep after it 
the whole time, and the weather conditions were certainly not the 
best. Fortunately, we were able to keep out of most of the 
trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only mechanical problems the winners had through the  
grueling event were a broken alternator that cost them four laps in 
the pits during the first four hours of the race and the radio 
problems on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes-Robinson said there also was a problem with rubber  
building up on the car's foot pedals. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were sticking, so if you gave it a hard throttle, it just  
stayed on,'' he said. ``You had to stick the clutch in to stop the 
slide. That can get pretty busy. But the car was working so well, 
it was a pleasure to drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winners, who started fifth in the 77 car field, covered 708  
laps -- 2,520.48 miles -- and averaged 104.9 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second Rolex 24 victory in three years for Dyson's  
team. In fact, all four winning drivers were part of the winning 
team in 1997, when an Indianapolis-built Riley &AMP; Scott Ford won for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The other Dyson car, shared by pole-winner James Weaver of  
England, Stuart Hayner, Dorsey Schroeder and Dyson, led several 
times in the early going and was out front until the sixth hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it collided with a slower car in the chicane on the  
backstretch. That sent the car to the pits for more than an hour 
and ended its shot at the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	But, eventually the car returned to competition and Dyson was at  
the wheel at the end, finishing 22nd, 115 laps behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I was out there in the rain, I was thinking what an  
awesome experience a 24-hour race is,'' said Dyson, a wealthy 
businessman from Pleasant Valley, N.Y. ``To win it once is amazing. 
To win it twice ... it's really an awesome experience in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Can-Am class Ferrari shared by CART stars Jimmy Vasser and Max  
Papis, former Formula One driver Stefan Johansson and owner Jim 
Matthews led several times in the first half of the race. But they 
wound up third, trailing the winners across the finish line by 14 
laps. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth, five more laps back, was another Ferrari, this one  
driven by Enzo Calderari, Angelo Zadra, Carl Rosenblad and Lilian 
Bryner, one of only three women in the 77-car field. 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth-place car, finishing just 643 laps, was another Can-Am  
Ferrari, co-driven by Henry Camferdam, Duncan Dayton, Eliseo 
Salazar and Scott Schubot. 
</P>
<P>
	A Porsche 911, the winning GT3 class entry co-driven by Cort  
Wagner, Kelly Collins, Anthony Lazzaro and Darryl Havens, finished 
sixth overall. Next came the GT2 class winner, another Porsche 911, 
with Andre Ahrle, Hubert Haupt and David Warnock driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-four cars were running at the end of the attrition-filled  
event. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 15 full-course caution flags for a total of 176  
minutes. That kept the Chevrolet Corvette pace car so busy that at 
one point on Saturday night, United States Road Racing Championship 
officials had to use a backup pace car while the primary went to 
the gas pumps. 
</P>
<P>
	But, even with all the early traffic and the spate of yellows,  
there were no serious crashes in the Rolex, the official beginning 
of Daytona's Speed Weeks, which will peak on Feb. 14 with the 
Daytona 500.

 *Richard H. Freyberg    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dr. Richard Harold Freyberg, a leading  
rheumatologist who helped organize the Arthritis Foundation, died 
Jan. 23 at his Florida home. He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	While serving as director of the division of rheumatic diseases  
at Manhattan's Hospital for Special Surgery, Freyberg was also 
chief of the arthritis clinic at New York Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1948 meeting with a few colleagues and Floyd Odium, an  
industrialist afflicted with rheumatoid arthritis, led to the 
founding of the Arthritis Foundation, which was launched with a 
$500,000 fund-raiser led by Bob Hope. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation moved to Atlanta in 1977 and today operates with  
a $110 million budget and 700,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974 Freyberg left for Palm Desert, Calif., to help establish  
the arthritis and rheumatism wing of Eisenhower Medical Center. He 
remained active as a lecturer and writer after retiring to Venice, 
Fla., and co-wrote ``The History of Rheumatology,'' published in 
1985.

 *Mills E. Godwin Jr.    	
</P>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Mills E. Godwin Jr., a former two-term  
governor regarded as one of Virginia's greatest leaders of the 
century for his work to modernize the education system, died 
Saturday. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Godwin, elected as a Democrat in 1965 and as a Republican in  
1973, was praised by leaders of both parties for transforming the 
once largely rural state with a community college system and a 
state sales tax for school improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in his legislative career, Godwin was a principal  
architect of Virginia's massive resistance to school integration, a 
stance that helped him climb the leadership ranks, from a state 
senator in the 1950s to lieutenant governor in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Godwin later admitted the state waited too long to improve  
education for blacks. As governor, he was credited with 
contributions such as appointing the first black member of the 
state Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia bars its governor from serving consecutive terms, so it  
wasn't until 1973 that Godwin ran again. Godwin believed the 
Democratic Party had turned too liberal, joined the GOP and won by 
15,000 votes in one of the state's closest gubernatorial elections.

 *Huntz Hall    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Huntz Hall, star of more than 100 ``Bowery  
Boys'' and ``Dead End Kids'' films in the 1930s through the 1950s, 
died Saturday of heart failure. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall was one of a group of young actors who came to Hollywood to  
make a film version of the Sidney Kingsley play ``Dead End'' in 
1937, two years after he starred in the play on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	The film spawned a popular phenomenon that stretched over two  
decades, with the actors portraying the characters as victims of 
society in a series of films with both original and new actors. 
</P>
<P>
	The group went on to make several films for Warner Bros.,  
including ``Angels with Dirty Faces,'' ``They Made Me a Criminal'' 
and ``Crime School'' with names like James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart 
and John Garfield. 
</P>
<P>
	The actors moved to Universal and changed their name to ``The  
East Side Kids'' in the 1940s. Hall and original costar Leo Gorcey 
made 49 comedy films as ``The Bowery Boys'' after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall later appeared in the films ``A Walk in the Sun'' in 1945,  
``Gentle Giant'' in 1967, ``Herbie Rides Again'' in 1974 and ``The 
Escape Artist'' in 1982. He starred as producer Jesse Laske in Ken 
Russel's ``Valentino'' in 1977.

 *William E. Hunt    	
</P>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Dr. William E. Hunt, a retired  
neurosurgeon at Ohio State University who devised a widely used 
system for the clinical evaluation of brain aneurysms, died Tuesday 
of heart problems. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt was best known for the Hunt-Hess classification for  
weakened blood vessels in the brain, called intracranial aneurysms. 
Named also after a resident who worked with him, Dr. Robert Hess, 
it is the most widely used classification of aneurysms. 
</P>
<P>
	Working with a Spanish pathologist, Dr. Eduardo Tolosa, Hunt  
defined the Tolosa-Hunt syndrome of ophthalmoplegia, a painful 
paralysis of the eye muscles. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1973 to 1988 he was the principal investigator and director  
of the national Spinal Cord Injury Research Center based at Ohio 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	He was on the American Board of Neurological Surgery, which  
oversees graduate medical education in that specialty, and wrote a 
textbook about the Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, as well as articles for 
professional journals. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a faculty member at Ohio State University for 37 years,  
retiring as a professor emeritus of surgery in 1991. He was the 
chairman of its division of neurological surgery from 1964 to 1989.

<HEADLINE> Golota Seeks Fight With Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Andrew Golota, winner of five  
straight fights since a 1997 loss to WBC heavyweight champion 
Lennox Lewis, now wants Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	The promotional prospects alone enthralled Golota promoter Dino  
Duva: Tyson, the volatile ear-biter who was banned from boxing for 
a year, against Golota, the low-blow specialist who was twice 
disqualified in 1996 bouts against Riddick Bowe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone acknowledges that would be a tremendous promotion,''  
said Duva, who hopes to make a Tyson-Golota fight by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Golota looked crisp and in control in posting a  
unanimous 10-round decision over journeyman Jesse Ferguson. Though 
he never knocked down Ferguson, Golota (33-3) dominated with strong 
left jabs and punishing overhand rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson, 41, was a late substitute for Jimmy Thunder, who tore  
an Achilles tendon in training and withdrew Wednesday. Ferguson 
signed for the fight Thursday, salvaging the card headlined by 
unbeaten heavyweight Michael Grant. 
</P>
<P>
	When he entered the ring before 2,724 fans in the Convention  
Hall ballroom, the ``Mission: Impossible'' theme boomed from 
loudspeakers. 
</P>
<P>
	It soon became apparent that it was. Ferguson (26-18) fought  
gamely but never seriously challenged Golota nor landed any big 
punches. 
</P>
<P>
	The same could be said about Grant's opponent, Ahmad Abdin, who  
was stopped after 10 rounds of a scheduled 12-rounder against the 
IBC champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, a 6-foot-7, 250-pounder with 28 victories, was fighting  
for the first time in nine months. His previous scheduled bout was 
canceled after he came down with hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
	But his long reach kept Abdin, a former sparring partner, from  
getting close enough to do much damage. And Grant kept the pressure 
on, wearing down Abdin with left jabs. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, of Norristown, Pa., knocked Abdin down with a vicious  
right to the body at the end of the ninth round. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 10th, Grant nailed a charging Abdin with an overhand  
right that dropped him again. Later in the round, he knocked down 
Abdin a third time with a left. Abdin got up at eight, after the 
bell. 
</P>
<P>
	But referee Eddie Cotton, acting on the advice of ringside  
physician Dr. Kenneth Remsen, stopped the fight after the 10th. 
``He was disoriented,'' Remsen said. ``His eyes were rolled up. He 
had a blank stare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdin, of Houston, dropped to 25-2-3.  
</P>
<P>
	Grant said he had no preference about who he would fight next.  
When asked about Golota, he said: ``I think nothing of Andrew 
Golota. He has his own destiny and it's in his hands. I'll leave it 
up to (manager) Don Turner.''

<HEADLINE> VA Doctors Eye Pain As Vital Sign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a first for the Department of Veterans  
Affairs, the huge health-care provider is launching a systemwide 
effort this month to reduce pain and suffering for many of its 3.4 
million patients. 
</P>
<P>
	VA doctors and nurses will be instructed to treat pain as a  
``fifth vital sign,'' meaning they should assess and record 
patients' pain just as they would note other health-care basics 
like blood pressure, pulse, temperature and breathing rate. 
</P>
<P>
	They are to ask patients to rate their pain on a scale of one to  
10, then will consult with the patients about ways to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really changing how people think,'' said Dr. Kenneth  
Kizer, Veterans Affairs undersecretary for health. ``We're too 
often obsessed with the diagnosis and finding what's going on in a 
molecular, cellular, pharmacological level as opposed to, `Is the 
person feeling better?''' 
</P>
<P>
	It might take two or three years to implement the program at all  
1,100 sites where VA delivers health care, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative, which evolved from agency efforts to improve  
care for the dying, also calls for staff training in pain treatment 
and spending $3 million to $5 million on pain-management research. 
</P>
<P>
	That such a large medical system -- the nation's biggest -- is  
heightening efforts to fight pain is laudable, health and pain 
experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really is a significant step forward,'' said Richard Muir,  
executive director of the American Pain Society, a professional 
society of nearly 4,000 clinicians and academics. ``There are not 
many large organizations that have put together a systematic 
approach to pain management.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Thomas Reardon, president-elect of the American Medical  
Association, said, ``There's a new awareness out there among the 
health-care industry that we need to do a better job'' on pain. 
Veterans Affairs' effort is ``another circumstance where a hospital 
system ... is aware that we need to make improvements and is taking 
steps to improve,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort to make pain treatment a higher priority in medicine  
is not new. Experts have been talking of the need to improve pain 
treatment at least since the 1970s, and the American Pain Society 
has urged treatment of pain as a ``fifth vital sign'' since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Many hospitals have established pain centers and pain-treatment  
programs, but many others are doing little or nothing, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's spotty, and some years ago it was universally just  
terrible,'' said C. Richard Chapman, an anesthesiology professor at 
the University of Washington and president-elect of the 
Anesthesiology Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Zeeck, 44, of Tacoma, Wash., had to quit his job as an  
aircraft mechanic in 1994 because of pain from Crohn's disease, a 
stress-related gastrointestinal disorder. He was dissatisfied with 
his pain treatment at a local civilian hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	But after 1 1/2 years of outpatient visits to Seattle's VA  
facility, he is ready to begin a new career as a home inspector. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the pain clinic they make you realize that zero pain is  
something that you're probably never going to achieve,'' Zeeck 
said. ``They control the pain medication here. ... Before, they 
were giving me pain medication every time I said ouch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Studies and experts estimate that tens of millions of Americans  
suffer from some sort of pain each year, with persistent pain 
costing around $100 billion a year in lost productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the blame lies with patients who don't want to be seen  
as whining for pain treatment, said Barbara Coombs Lee, executive 
director of Compassion In Dying in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patients are sensitive to be labeled as drug seekers,'' she  
said. ``They don't want to appear as being weak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But attitudes are changing.  
</P>
<P>
	``The patient's going to die in two months from their cancer.  
What does it matter if they're addicted or not?'' undersecretary 
Kizer said. ``Even though the science shows they don't become 
addicted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kizer said he hopes the VA pain initiative will have impact  
beyond VA facilities through training that students from many of 
the nation's medical schools take in Veterans Affairs facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked at this as something that I would hope would  
influence the practice of medicine throughout the country,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort could lead to changes in other federal programs.  
</P>
<P>
	As part of his effort to find a middle ground in the debate over  
physician-assisted suicide, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he hopes 
to improve pain treatment through the Medicare and Medicaid 
insurance programs. ``It takes a while,'' Wyden said, ``but the 
federal government is finally starting to get it.''

<HEADLINE> Lajunen Wins Nordic Combined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LE BRASSUS, Switzerland (AP) -- Olympic silver medalist and  
former World Cup champion Samppa Lajunen of Finland held off 
American Todd Lodwick to win a nordic combined World Cup event by 
10.4 seconds Sunday in tricky conditions with blowing snow. 
</P>
<P>
	The event was spread over two nations with 90-meter ski jumping  
Saturday in Chaux Neuve, France, and a 15-kilometer race Sunday in 
LeBrassus. 
</P>
<P>
	Lajunen was second in the jumping behind Russian Alexei Fadeev  
but he stalked Fadeev, who fades in the cross-country skiing phase 
of the two-event sport, until he took the lead, and stayed ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Lodwick, fourth in jumping and starting 33 seconds behind  
Lajunen, pulled into second place on the second of three laps and 
kept closing on the Finn but couldn't catch him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should've been a 20K race,'' Lodwick joked at the finish.  
</P>
<P>
	The World Cup tour takes a break in February with the nordic  
World Championships Feb. 18-28 in Ramsau, Austria, before the final 
three weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	World Cup points leader and '98 Olympic champion Bjarte Engen  
Vik of Norway had his five-meet victory string cut as he jumped 
poorly and finished 36th.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Vows To Remain IOC Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Describing as ``rubbish'' some of  
the personal attacks against him, IOC president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch said Sunday only the committee's members are in a 
position to judge whether he should stay in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing continuing calls from outside the IOC for him to resign  
in connection with the widening Olympic corruption scandal, 
Samaranch vowed again to remain as long as he has the support of 
the general IOC membership. 
</P>
<P>
	``My obligation is to stay and to put all my efforts to get back  
the prestige that the IOC had during the last years,'' Samaranch 
said in an interview with six news agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old Spaniard, who has led the International Olympic  
Committee since 1980 and whose final term ends in 2001, announced 
last week that he would put his leadership to a vote of confidence 
at a special general assembly March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe some people they are very tired to see me as president  
after 18 years, mainly some people outside the IOC,'' Samaranch 
said. ``But I would like to repeat: I put my position to the IOC 
members. It is up to them. My position belongs to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he was confident of winning the vote, Samaranch  
was cautious. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what will happen,'' he said. ``I can assure you I  
have received many telephone calls, many letters from IOC members. 
Until now, they all are supporting me. But I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevan Gosper, a senior IOC executive board member from Australia  
and key Samaranch ally, said the president remains fully in 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any reports or any suggestion that the IOC is in disarray is  
wrong,'' he said. ``There is unanimous support within the executive 
board for the president. Every indication we get from the 
membership is support for the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he was confident the general assembly would  
support the recommendations of the executive board to expel six 
members for alleged misconduct stemming from Salt Lake City's 
winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	An internal IOC investigation found that 14 members received  
cash payments, scholarships for their relatives, free medical care 
and other favors. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine have either resigned or been expelled, three remain under  
investigation, one received a warning and one has died. Other 
members could be implicated as the investigation continues. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those ousted have refused to go quietly, saying they  
will fight for reinstatement at the special assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other organizations, including the Justice Department and  
FBI, are investigating the Salt Lake City bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the IOC was being attacked even though it was the  
first body to begin an inquiry and the first to release any 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are doing what we promised to solve the problem  
regarding IOC members as soon as possible,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allegations of vote-buying have spread to Sydney, host of the  
2000 Games, and other cities. The IOC has asked all cities involved 
in bids for the games of 1996 and onwards to report any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is we are dealing only with facts,  
not with rumors,'' Samaranch said. ``If someone is telling, `One 
IOC member did this,' please say the name and give the proof. With 
rumors we cannot act. I think we showed to the world when we have 
facts we are acting very quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch spoke two days before an IOC-sponsored world summit on  
drugs in sports, a meeting IOC officials fear could be overshadowed 
by the unfolding corruption crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper dismissed suggestions the IOC has no ethical authority to  
lead the anti-drug fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no other group who can move the anti-doping program  
forward more than ourselves,'' he said. ``It is quite wrong that we 
don't have that authority. ... Our focus is on getting people's 
minds back to the main subject: the interests of the athletes and 
the Olympic Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he was ``astonished'' by the attacks against him  
in the world's media, decrying the ``rubbish that is said in some 
papers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Samaranch said he was told Sunday that a Swedish  
publication reported that he lives in a villa and flies by 
helicopter every day to IOC headquarters. In fact, Samaranch stays 
in a hotel suite in Lausanne and travels by car to his office. 
</P>
<P>
	He recounted that a Japanese paper accused him of frolicking  
with geisha at a ``huge party'' at a hotel in Nagano at the close 
of the 1998 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``First of all, I was with my wife,'' Samaranch said. ``And  
second, I am 78 years old. I am not of the age to have parties with 
geisha girls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he was also disturbed by more reports attacking  
his role during the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco in his 
native Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I did in Spain must be judged by the Spaniards.'' he  
said. ``The Spaniards they know me very well and the judgment is 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who inherited an organization facing bankruptcy and  
turned the Olympics into a multibillion-dollar industry, defended 
his record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we did something during these 18 years,'' he said. ``I  
presided over seven games. The seven games were a big, huge 
success, even an economic success for the countries and the cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, we have an important position in our society. This is  
thanks to the efforts that all the members, especially the 
executive board members and myself, made during the last years. 
Today, the Olympic Games is the most important event in the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Fifty percent of the Swiss public thinks Samaranch should  
resign, according to a survey in the Zurich weekly SonntagsBlick. 
The survey also found 63 percent still support the Swiss bid to 
hold the 2006 Winter Olympics in Sion. 
</P>
<P>
	--Two Australians -- IOC executive board member Kevan Gosper and  
IOC member Phil Coles -- are among those being investigated by the 
FBI in the Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI reportedly is examining links between 60 past and  
present IOC members and students at the University of Utah to 
discover whether scholarships were given in return for votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said the inquiry ``certainly won't be a distraction.''  
Coles called the investigation ``disgusting'' and ``extremely 
damaging to me and my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--An unexplained $13 million was earmarked as a ``secret weapon''  
to aid Melbourne's 1996 Olympics bid, the Herald Sun in Melbourne 
reported. The newspaper said records do not say where the money was 
to go but it was not to be spent until after Melbourne won the 
event. The city lost to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	--Former Toronto mayor Art Eggleton denies his city auditor told  
him of any financial wrongdoing in 1988 when the city was bidding 
for the 1996 Olympics, the Toronto Star reported. Toronto bid 
organizers said last week a 1991 report revealed IOC delegates cost 
the Toronto committee $800,000 in gifts and shopping sprees.

<HEADLINE> Davis Helps Bring 2nd Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- One Super Bowl MVP award was enough for Terrell  
Davis. He was perfectly content to let John Elway get all the glory 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, last year's MVP in the NFL's championship game, fought  
off leg cramps and an initially unyielding Atlanta defense to turn 
in a fine all-around performance that, in other years, might have 
been worthy of the most valuable honor. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the 38-year-old Elway capturing that award, Davis  
starred in a supporting role in the Denver Broncos' 34-19 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos, as expected, ran Davis -- 25 carries for 102 yards.  
They also had him catch passes -- two for 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	And, in a move that caught the Falcons off guard on more than  
one occasion, they even used him as a decoy. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the biggest play of the game came when Elway and Davis  
pulled off a perfect run fake on a play-action pass. The trickery 
froze the Atlanta secondary, who devoted their defensive game plan 
to stopping Davis, and Elway threw an 80-yard touchdown pass to Rod 
Smith to put the Broncos ahead 17-3 in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mind being a decoy at all,'' Davis said. ``It doesn't  
matter. I'll do what I need to do to help this team win 
championships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was the league's MVP during the regular season after  
rushing for 2,008 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of key people on this team,'' Davis said. ``When  
you stop our running game, you have to deal with our passing game. 
John was really on today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to expectations that Elway might retire, Davis said,  
``This was a storybook ending for him if he decides to leave the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Davis' seventh straight 100-yard rushing game in the  
postseason, an NFL record. He and Washington's John Riggins had 
been tied with six in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a heck of a game,'' Atlanta coach Dan Reeves said of  
Davis. ``I've never seen anybody break so many tackles. They can 
really spread the ball around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said the Broncos' second straight Super Bowl title ``was a  
lot better than the first. At least to me, this one was sweeter. It 
is so tough to repeat, especially having a target on your back all 
season like we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who ran for 157 yards and three touchdowns in last year's  
31-24 win over Green Bay, had only 18 yards on six carries in the 
first quarter against the stubborn Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	But he cranked it up on a drive that led to a field goal and a  
10-3 lead early in the second quarter. He had runs of 8 and 13 
yards, and then added 6 yards with a nifty spin move to elude 
Falcons end Chuck Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a 15-yard gain late in the half as the Broncos took a  
17-6 lead at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
	In a scoreless third quarter, Davis, a secondary receiver,  
caught a short pass from Elway and turned it into an 11-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the quarter, he broke an attempted tackle by linebacker  
Jessie Tuggle and reversed his field for an 11-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the final period, Davis caught a short pass off the  
left side. Breaking tackles and maintaining his balance along the 
sideline, he turned it into a 39-yard gain to the Atlanta 9-yard 
line. Two plays later, Elway's 3-yard run on a quarterback draw put 
the Broncos ahead 31-6 with 11:20 remaining.

<HEADLINE> Women Have Majority in Wash. Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- The surest sign that women have arrived as  
powerbrokers in the Washington state Senate? They took over the 
biggest bathroom off the Senate chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	The women are still chuckling over that little power play, made  
possible by their 2-to-1 majority in the Democratic caucus. They've 
also nailed down just about every Senate leadership and committee 
post. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate, a male bastion for most of the state's history, is  
closing in on an even split with 23 women among the 49 members. And 
the House has 37 women among the 98 seats, giving Washington state 
the country's highest percentage of female lawmakers -- 41 percent, 
with 60 of 147 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Sid Snyder jokes about being one of the  
token males in the Democratic caucus, which has 18 women and nine 
men. 
</P>
<P>
	Women say they'll improve the tone of debate and produce more  
family-centered legislation, dealing with schools and traffic jams 
and other down-home concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	No more good ol' boys and talking issues to death, they say.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're just nervier,'' says state Rep. Ida Ballasiotes.  
</P>
<P>
	Women from both parties and both houses recently announced a  
``women-led economic agenda'' and posed by a photo montage of the 
House membership of a century earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lot of facial hair there,'' state Rep. Mary Lou  
Dickerson said of the picture. ``All men. What a difference a 
century makes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The national average for female legislators is 22 percent,  
according to the Center for the American Woman and Politics at 
Rutgers University. Other states in the Top 10, with women making 
up roughly a third of their lawmakers, are Nevada, Arizona, 
Colorado, Kansas, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Maryland and 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama, which has less than 8 percent female legislators, is at  
the other end of the scale with Oklahoma, Kentucky, South Carolina 
and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides installing the nation's highest percentage of female  
legislators, Washington voters in November re-elected Patty Murray 
to the U.S. Senate -- over a female opponent -- and gave the state 
three female Supreme Court justices, a third of the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's executive branch has women as attorney general,  
school chief, land commissioner and insurance commissioner -- all 
elected posts. Attorney General Christine Gregoire was the broker 
of last year's multibillion-dollar settlement between the states 
and the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Washington, it's not a novelty,'' says Cathy Allen, vice  
chairwoman of the National Women's Political Caucus and a Seattle 
political consultant. ``We became accustomed very early on to 
voting for the gutsy, entrepreneurial women who were role models in 
government, business and the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, however, is the first in the nation to have an  
all-female elected line of succession: governor, secretary of 
state, attorney general, treasurer and superintendent of public 
instruction. They were all sworn in by U.S. Supreme Court Justice 
Sandra Day O'Connor, an Arizonan who was the first woman appointed 
to the nation's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington women head key committees in both legislative houses  
this session and hold many leadership posts, including the floor 
leadership positions for both parties in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their gains, state Sen. Darlene Fairley still sees  
vestiges of sexism. Some male lawmakers, she said, still talk about 
the ``girls'' taking over and ``gripe, gripe, gripe'' when the 
women assert themselves.

<HEADLINE> Cherifi Hurt Before Title Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- WBC middleweight champion Hassini Cherifi, who  
was to defend his title Saturday night in a rematch against Keith 
Holmes, has withdrawn from the bout after suffering a back injury 
in his final sparring session in France. 
</P>
<P>
	Cherifi has flown to Florida and will undergo an MRI on Monday  
to determine how long the he'll be out of the ring. Meanwhile, 
promoters hope to fill Cherifi's spot on Saturday's card at the 
Washington Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking for a rated contender to fight for the interim  
championship until Cherifi can come back,'' Bob Goodman, director 
of boxing for Don King Promotions, said Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Cherifi won the title from District of Columbia native Holmes  
with a unanimous decision May 2 in his native France. 
</P>
<P>
	Cherifi becomes the second champion to pull out of the card.  
William Joppy was to defend his WBA middleweight belt, but he 
suffered a cracked vertebrae in an automobile accident last week 
and is expected to spend three months recuperating. 
</P>
<P>
	The evening will still feature two world title bouts. Bernard  
Hopkins of Philadelphia will defend his IBF middleweight title 
against No. 1 contender Robert Allen of Atlanta, and WBA 
super-lightweight champion Sharmba Mitchell of Washington will 
fight Pedro Saiz of New York.

<HEADLINE> More Birds Are Thriving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEMPTON, Pa. (AP) -- Every autumn, the raptors flee the cold  
Canadian wilderness and soar southward, kept aloft by columns of 
heat that rise from the Earth and updrafts bouncing off the 
Appalachian Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	The migratory route carries the birds -- bald eagles, Cooper's  
hawks and an occasional rare golden eagle -- over Hawk Mountain 
Sanctuary, about two hours north of Philadelphia, where wildlife 
researchers in 1998 reported another record number of sightings. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservationists believe these birds of prey are thriving  
because the air, water and land are cleaner than 50 years ago, when 
pollution and pesticides were destroying raptor populations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of these species are no longer environmental basket  
cases, as they were earlier this century,'' said Keith Bildstein, 
the sanctuary's director of research and education. ``You have 
different kinds of raptors doing well, which to me suggests it's a 
widespread phenomenon and a healthier environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the annual four-month ``hawkwatch'' that ended in  
mid-December, researchers counted 24,196 raptors, including at 
least 16 species. That count was the ninth highest in the 
sanctuary's 64-year history. The largest number counted was 40,698 
in 1978; the annual average is 17,827. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's total included 144 golden eagles, 154 bald eagles  
and 1,121 Cooper's hawks -- at least three times the annual average 
for each species. The last record for golden eagles sightings was 
100, set in 1995; for bald eagles it was 136, also set that year; 
and for Cooper's hawks it was 786, set in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Bildstein said the lowest count for golden eagles was 12 in  
1966; for bald eagles it was 13 in 1974, and for Cooper's hawks it 
was 61 in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	Raptors migrate from as far north as Greenland to as far south  
as Argentina. Bildstein said the birds rely on ``thermals'' or 
columns of rising hot air for at least part of their migratory 
journey. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thermals will allow them to soar south using far less  
energy,'' he said. ``To a large extent, many of our migrants are 
solar-powered birds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corky Potter, director of Shavers Creek Environmental Center, an  
extension of Penn State University in Centre County, agreed that a 
cleaner environment has contributed to the increased sightings, but 
he cited other reasons, including the reintroduction by man of 
once-endangered species and weather-pattern changes that draw birds 
from other migratory routes. 
</P>
<P>
	National Audubon Society researchers also believe an emphasis on  
conserving habitats and preserving land has contributed to higher 
counts, said Cindy Dunn, executive director of the society's state 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's an increase in the number of people feeding  
birds and providing backyard habitats,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The disappearance of the pesticide DDT, which had a disastrous  
affect on the bald eagles' reproductive process before it was 
banned nearly three decades ago, is believed to be one reason for 
the increased populations of that species. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2,400-acre Hawk Mountain was founded by conservationist  
Rosalie Edge to stop the indiscriminate killing of migrating hawks 
and eagles along the eastern edge of the Appalachian range. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of birds were killed in the late 1920s and early  
1930s. The Pennsylvania Game Commission once offered a $5 bounty 
for northern goshawks. And until 1969, it was legal to kill a 
Cooper's hawk. The birds are now protected by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctuary attracts about 90,000 visitors a year. They hike  
its miles of trails and climb its high ridges to enjoy the 
panoramas and observe the raptors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hawk watching has grown from being unheard of at the beginning  
of this century,'' Bildstein said. ``Today, it's a sport, but it's 
also making significant contributions to our knowledge of 
raptors.''

<HEADLINE> Rare Blue Moon Rises; 1 More Coming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A blue moon rose Sunday, but don't worry if you  
missed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Another blue moon will be coming on the night of March 31.  
</P>
<P>
	Two blue moons in one year happens every 20 to 40 years. The  
last time was in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	The term ``blue moon'' refers to the occasional occurrence of  
two full moons in the same month, which usually happens roughly 
once every 33 months. The last full moon was Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The second full moon in a month is called a blue moon,  
regardless of tint. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having two full moons in two months in one year is really kind  
of nifty, no matter what you call them,'' said Jack Horkheimer of 
the Miami Space Transit Planetarium. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronomers predict the next occurrence of two blue moons in one  
year will be in 2018, on Jan. 31 and March 31, and again on the 
same dates in 2037.

<HEADLINE> Silver Charm's Run to $10M Derailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Silver Charm's path to becoming  
thoroughbred racing's first $10 million horse just got a little 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
	By finishing third to Puerto Madero in Saturday's $500,000 Donn  
Handicap, the big gray California horse will need to run another 
race or two to reach the milestone. Maybe more. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just tells you that you can't win every time,'' said Bob  
Lewis, Silver Charm's owner. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it continues a trend in which one of racing's few  
marquee names hasn't quite lived up to his billing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Donn marked only the second time in 21 starts that Silver  
Charm had finished worse than second. But after just missing the 
1997 Triple Crown after winning the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, 
he hasn't won a Grade I race in the United States since that 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm's big win last year came on foreign soil, in the $4  
million Dubai World Cup. He finished second to Awesome Again in the 
Breeders' Cup Classic last November. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, he was hampered by starting from the outside post  
in the 12-horse field. Unable to break fast enough to cut inside 
quickly, he was forced to settle in behind the back and left 
himself too much ground to make up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's early in the year,'' trainer Bob Baffert said. ``If you  
use him up too early, you'll wind up knocking your horse out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That becomes even more significant now. An ambitious schedule  
calls for Silver Charm to run next in the Santa Anita Handicap on 
March 6, then return to Dubai to defend his World Cup championship. 
</P>
<P>
	If he wins both those races, Silver Charm would pull within some  
$316,000 of Cigar's all-time earnings record of $9,999,815. 
Saturday's result did allow him to move past Alysheba into third 
place with $6,683,006. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Puerto Madero showed he has the credentials to make a  
name for himself in the handicap division. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chilean-bred horse won for the 11th time in 16 starts, a  
better percentage than Silver Charm's. But his first 10 races came 
in South America, so there was no way to gauge the quality of 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Since arriving in California less than a year ago, Puerto Madero  
has won three times in six starts and twice finished second to Skip 
Away, the leading candidate for 1998 Horse of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's structurally grown into a better horse,'' trainer Richard  
Mandella said. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Madero will skip the Santa Anita Handicap, the next race  
in the National Thoroughbred Racing Association's new series 
featuring older horses. Instead, Mandella is pointing to Dubai and 
a likely rematch with Silver Charm. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very, very proud,'' jockey Kent Desormeaux said of Puerto  
Madero. ``He's a handful to hold to the ground. He knows what his 
job is and he wants to get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's race drew 21,325 to Gulfstream Park, the largest  
crowd for a Donn Handicap since 1991. It also produced a mutuel 
handle of more than $18 million, the best at Gulfstream for any day 
except those involving the Florida Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a marketing standpoint, this is what it's all about --  
making a big day bigger,'' NTRA commissioner Tim Smith said.

<HEADLINE> Unruly Passengers Left at Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- A dozen people became so unruly on a charter  
jet from London to Jamaica that the captain made an unscheduled 
stop and left them stranded at a Virginia airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``About 12 passengers consumed quite a fair amount of alcohol  
and became somewhat unruly,'' said Norfolk International Airport 
manager Wayne Shank. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the travelers on the Airtours charter jet -- six English  
and Irish couples -- face any charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble apparently began with shouting and a drink thrown by  
one passenger on another traveler. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chief flight attendant attempted to settle them down with  
no success, so the captain decided to divert the aircraft to 
Norfolk,'' Shank told The Virginian-Pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	The passengers who were left behind were questioned by airport  
police and FBI agents. 
</P>
<P>
	``After thorough investigation, it was determined that there had  
been no direct interference with the flight crew and the local U.S. 
attorney declined to prosecute,'' Shank said. Interfering with a 
flight crew is a federal charge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patty Schlosser, an FBI spokeswoman in Norfolk, said the  
passengers made their own arrangements to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Shank said the group had calmed down by the time the plane  
landed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the fact that the pilot put the airplane on the ground  
and allowed local police aboard was in and of itself a sobering 
experience,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NASA Spacecraft To Bring Back Comet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- For the first time since the Apollo  
moon landings, NASA is launching a mission into outer space to 
bring back extraterrestrial material. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, NASA is going after comet and interstellar dust.  
</P>
<P>
	Stardust, the robotic spacecraft that will collect the tiny  
grains, is due to lift off Feb. 6 on a journey that will span seven 
years and 3.2 billion miles. 
</P>
<P>
	It is NASA's first attempt to bring back pieces of a comet, in  
this case a comet that until the 1970s rarely ventured close to the 
sun and so still should contain the original, frozen components of 
the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
	By studying samples of the well-preserved Comet Wild-2,  
pronounced Vilt-2, scientists hope to better understand how icy, 
rocky comets may have provided the water and organics necessary for 
life to form on Earth -- and possibly elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``The study of comets is extremely important,'' says Carl  
Pilcher, NASA's science director for solar system exploration, 
``not only for understanding the origin of life on Earth but for 
understanding the biological potential of other planets, since the 
same comets that were hitting the Earth when the Earth was forming 
were probably also hitting Venus and Mars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If everything goes well -- a big if considering all the risks and  
uncertainties -- the $128 million Stardust will meet up with Comet 
Wild-2 on Jan. 2, 2004. The spacecraft already will have gathered 
interstellar dust while circling the sun en route to the comet. 
</P>
<P>
	Shielded in its most vulnerable areas, the 850-pound probe will  
fly between the comet nucleus and the sun, going through the 
comet's surrounding fuzzy cloud, called a coma. 
</P>
<P>
	Stardust will pass within 93 miles of Comet Wild-2, believed to  
be about 2 1/2 miles in diameter. Scientists say that's close enough 
to get good pictures and samples, yet hopefully far enough away to 
avoid being clobbered by large comet chunks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel the likelihood of this (collision) is very small,''  
says Stardust's chief scientist, Donald Brownlee, an astronomer at 
the University of Washington in Seattle. ``However, we are going 
into an unknown environment. No spacecraft has ever gone this close 
to a comet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists estimate it will take just minutes for Stardust to  
fly through the worst of the cometary hailstorm. The probe will 
speed by at a relatively modest 13,650 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	A navigation camera, peering at times through a periscope for  
protection, will photograph Comet Wild-2 during the final approach 
and actual flyby. At the same time, the dust-catcher, resembling an 
oversize tennis racket, will be exposed. It will pop out of 
Stardust's return capsule about 1 1/2 weeks before the spacecraft 
reaches the comet. 
</P>
<P>
	The dust-catching racket is covered on both sides with a pale  
blue glass foam called aerogel -- the latest in celestial flypaper. 
The extraordinarily light, porous silica material is ideal for the 
job, says Brownlee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wonderful thing about the aerogel is that ... it's  
beautifully transparent so we see these particles. We can find them 
inside,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep the aerogel free of earthly debris that might be  
mistaken for comet dust, NASA baked the return capsule for days and 
then purged it with nitrogen gas, a process still going on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's as pure as we can get it,'' says Rick Grammier, deputy  
project manager at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Once thousands if not millions of comet particles have been  
trapped in the aerogel, all in a matter of minutes, the racket will 
fold back down into the return capsule for the roundabout trip back 
to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	On one side of the racket will be the comet dust, quite possibly  
containing interstellar grains that were the building blocks for 
the solar system 4.6 billion years ago, thus the name Stardust. On 
the other side will be the much younger interstellar dust gathered 
by the spacecraft a few years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Touchdown is slated for Jan. 15, 2006.  
</P>
<P>
	The plan calls for the return capsule, containing the racket and  
embedded particles, to separate from Stardust at an altitude of 
69,000 miles and parachute into a military installation in the Utah 
desert. An onboard radio beacon will guide searchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The white-and-brown capsule -- 32 inches in diameter and shaped  
like an acorn -- will enter Earth's atmosphere at more than 28,000 
mph. That's 4,000 mph faster than the Apollo capsules that returned 
men from the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	In order for the capsule to survive the searing re-entry,  
engineers designed a lightweight heat shield made of 
phenolic-impregnated carbon. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has to hit the right entry corridor with the kind of  
accuracy that Michael Jordan makes on his best shots,'' says Joseph 
Vellinga, program manager for Lockheed Martin Corp., which built 
Stardust. ``We have to be precisely in the right location and at a 
very precise angle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASA will initiate ``a doomsday maneuver'' if the spacecraft is  
off course. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's doomsday only to the project because the spacecraft then  
goes on around in a solar orbit with the capsule still attached and 
we don't get the samples back,'' explains Vellinga. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA expects Stardust to bring back about 1 milligram of comet  
and interstellar particles -- not enough to fill a thimble. By 
contrast, the 12 Apollo moonwalkers hauled back 842 pounds of lunar 
rock and dirt from 1969 through 1972, the last celestial samples to 
be returned to Earth by NASA if you don't count microscopic 
particles brought back in space shuttle experiments. 
</P>
<P>
	For scientists, even the tiniest bit of pure comet dust will be  
a bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if we had a shovel full of this stuff, even if we had a  
bucket full, we would still be analyzing it at or near the atomic 
scale,'' says astronomer Brownlee. 
</P>
<P>
	The comet particles will not require any quarantine or special  
handling to protect the Earth against possible otherworldly germs. 
Comet dust falls harmlessly onto Earth all the time, scientists 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, they emphasize, the returned particles will be  
sterilized by the extreme heat generated when they bury into the 
Stardust aerogel. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Stardust is going first, solar wind particles collected  
by NASA's Genesis spacecraft will beat the comet samples back by 
three years. Genesis is to be launched in 2001, with a return date 
of 2003. NASA's big sample-return mission, to Mars, is targeted for 
launch in 2003 and 2005, with a 2008 delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Stardust and Genesis are part of NASA's Discovery program  
to explore the solar system at low cost. Stardust's $165 million 
price tag includes $37 million for mission operations; the tab 
climbs to about $200 million when adding in the Boeing rocket that 
will launch the spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA plans three more cometary missions over the next four  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just the beginning,'' says Brownlee.  
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Crowds Gassed in Denver After Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Police used tear gas Sunday night to break up  
crowds in downtown Denver after Broncos' fans spilled into the 
streets to celebrate a second straight Super Bowl victory. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second year in a row the city's championship  
celebration was marred by clashes between police and rowdy fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing to see some of that, that we can't  
celebrate without taking it to the extreme,'' said Mayor Wellington 
Webb. 
</P>
<P>
	Downtown bars emptied as the game ended and fans started  
bonfires and set off firecrackers. When the estimated crowd of 
1,000 would not disperse in Larimer Square, police threw tear gas 
canisters and marched down Larimer Street in riot gear, pounding 
their shields with their clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans scurried away in the smoke, collapsing on the street.  
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't give us any time,'' said John Giomin of Denver.  
``This really hurts. This really hurts. I've never been gassed 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Greeley, police also used tear gas to break up crowds  
celebrating the Broncos' win. Near the University of Northern 
Colorado, police used the gas as they were pelted with rocks and 
bottles. In Boulder, several hundred fans danced and cheered around 
a small bonfire. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in the old town area of Fort Collins turned to tear gas  
to break up a celebrating crowd. Some of the fans there threw rocks 
and bottles at officers, while others climbed light poles. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bill Owens, in Miami for the game but on his way back for  
the celebratory parade Monday, also was dismayed by the mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Colorado has so much to be proud of tonight... it would be a  
shame to mar it with any more violence,'' Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
	In several spots, officers on horseback kept crowds in check.  
Around the downtown area, people waved special newspaper editions, 
climbed poles and waved Bronco pennants. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems were not unexpected. As the game ended, police  
blocked off access into the downtown area from Interstate 25, which 
runs through the city, to keep the crowds down. 
</P>
<P>
	Downtown bars were havens of orange and blue as the Broncos took  
on the Atlanta Falcons. After Denver's 34-19 win, many brought 
their drinks and celebrations outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
	But police were prepared because, last year, about 30,000 people  
gathered downtown after the Broncos beat the Green Bay Packers in 
the Super Bowl. There were more than 25 arrests and 50 people were 
overcome by tear gas after people smashed shop windows, overturned 
cars and set fires in Larimer Square. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have said they believe a relatively small number of  
people were responsible for problems that dog the city after 
championship games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most law-abiding people found the people that were doing that  
pretty disgusting,'' said city spokesman Andrew Hudson. ``It's 
idiotic. It's that kind of behavior that is going to get people 
hurt and get people arrested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police issued warnings to the crowd before they threw the tear  
gas Sunday night. But there was tension between the police and 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Sherwood, 29, said he and his friends were caught off guard  
by the police response. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came down right after the game,'' he said. ``I walked up  
next to a policeman. He said, `Do you think you are safe?' Then 
they tear-gassed us.''

<HEADLINE> N.J. Gov. Breaks Leg Skiing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Gov. Christie Whitman was hospitalized  
Sunday after breaking a leg in a skiing accident in Switzerland, 
her spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman was attending the World Economic Forum in Davos and was  
skiing in a conference-organized event when she took a hard, 
twisting fall on an intermediate slope, spokesman Pete McDonough 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She suffered a fracture to the lower bones of one leg. The  
governor was feeling fine after surgery and would only need 
crutches, not a cast, during her recovery, McDonough said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's very athletic, and it comes with the territory,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the fourth time Whitman has undergone surgery in more  
than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, she had emergency surgery to remove her appendix.  
She had surgery in February 1996 to repair a nagging shoulder 
injury. In November 1995, she had a large ovarian cyst removed.

<HEADLINE> Broncos, Falcs Fans Primed for Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Denver fans with giant Styrofoam Bronco heads.  
Throngs of seemingly sane Atlanta faithful dancing the ``Dirty 
Bird'' at any mention of the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	Vendors of T-shirts and hot dogs competing for sidewalk space in  
the NFL's version of a Baghdad bazaar. And not one -- but four -- 
blimps in the air above. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the organized chaos, the bedlam found outside Pro  
Player Stadium Sunday at the Super Bowl. None of the sights, 
though, matched that of George Schiller, sitting somewhat glassy 
eyed in the parking lot with a turban-like bandage wrapped around 
his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four hours earlier, Schiller landed in the hospital  
because of a household accident in Goshen, N.Y. Despite 22 stitches 
and a flight connection in Pittsburgh, he remained determined to 
keep his date with the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's just say I had a close encounter of the third kind with  
my wife's china cabinet. It's a long story but it involved the 
dog,'' said Schiller, sipping a beer, his face still caked with 
blood. ``I had to come. My son had got me tickets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just then, the bus carrying the Broncos players arrived and  
Schiller saw John Elway, the Denver quarterback, peering out at 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't miss this for the world.''  
</P>
<P>
	A few parking rows over, a Dachshund named Alfred showed off his  
Elway jersey. His owner, Barbara Cramer of Lakewood, Colo., said 
her family's van broke down in Kansas City, but they just rented 
another one and made it to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, Denver fans showed off their giant horsehead gear to  
some Atlanta fan who responded -- of course -- with the ``Dirty 
Bird.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all they say. `Dirty Bird, Dirty Bird.' We just turn  
our back to them and give them a little giddyup,'' said Broncos fan 
Lance Clark of Denver. ``They're all Super Bowl rookies. They get 
caught up in the hype.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So what do Super Bowl rookies do?  
</P>
<P>
	Many Atlanta fans came just for the sights and sounds at the  
stadium, even though they had no tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've just come to party,'' said Mark Taylor, a medical  
technician from Atlanta. ``We've been season ticket holders for 10 
years, but we kept the faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His friend, Verna Carter, had already started doing that version  
of the ``Funky Chicken'' called the ``Dirty Bird.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Rodgers, another Falcon fan, said that back in September  
he never would have imagined seeing his team make it to the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives you goosebumps just thinking about it,'' Rodgers said  
tailgating next to a van while proclaiming: ``We're dropping y'all 
to second. Falcons 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, at an exclusive-looking tailgate party, rock 'n' roll  
sounds drifted over the parking lot and out to the vendors hawking 
every sort of NFL item -- and, needless to say -- all sorts of 
vittles. 
</P>
<P>
	Way up overhead, four blimps competed for airspace with lots of  
planes. The planes were trailing banners emblazoned with everything 
from beer advertisements to political sentiments on the president's 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Down below, it was equally crowded.  
</P>
<P>
	On the corner of 199th Street and Unity just outside the  
stadium, there were plenty of whistles -- but they were from traffic 
cops, not referees. The ``players'' here -- vendors, lots of them. 
</P>
<P>
	One hat stand tipped over, a cart full of Polish sausages almost  
spilled into the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is trying to make a dollar -- everybody,'' said Dolly  
Smith, who was hawking Super Bowl pins. ``If you see somebody with 
your product, you are going to go lower. This corner here is where 
the money is at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few feet away was Debbie Gleason of Denver. She was hawking  
miniature orange, white and blue Bronco ski hats. 
</P>
<P>
	This was an act of love, though, not of enterprise.  
</P>
<P>
	``My grandfather made about 200 and he passed away. He said: `If  
they make it to the Super Bowl, you can go and sell them,''' she 
explained.

<HEADLINE>  Crowds Gassed in Denver After Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Police used tear gas Sunday night to break up  
crowds in downtown Denver after Broncos' fans spilled into the 
streets to celebrate a second straight Super Bowl victory. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second year in a row the city's championship  
celebration was marred by clashes between police and rowdy fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing to see some of that, that we can't  
celebrate without taking it to the extreme,'' said Mayor Wellington 
Webb. 
</P>
<P>
	Downtown bars emptied as the game ended and fans started  
bonfires and set off firecrackers. When the estimated crowd of 
1,000 would not disperse in Larimer Square, police threw tear gas 
canisters and marched down Larimer Street in riot gear, pounding 
their shields with their clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans scurried away in the smoke, collapsing on the street.  
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't give us any time,'' said John Giomin of Denver.  
``This really hurts. This really hurts. I've never been gassed 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Greeley, police also used tear gas to break up crowds  
celebrating the Broncos' win. Near the University of Northern 
Colorado, police used the gas as they were pelted with rocks and 
bottles. In Boulder, several hundred fans danced and cheered around 
a small bonfire. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in the old town area of Fort Collins turned to tear gas  
to break up a celebrating crowd. Some of the fans there threw rocks 
and bottles at officers, while others climbed light poles. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bill Owens, in Miami for the game but on his way back for  
the celebratory parade Monday, also was dismayed by the mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Colorado has so much to be proud of tonight... it would be a  
shame to mar it with any more violence,'' Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
	In several spots, officers on horseback kept crowds in check.  
Around the downtown area, people waved special newspaper editions, 
climbed poles and waved Bronco pennants. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems were not unexpected. As the game ended, police  
blocked off access into the downtown area from Interstate 25, which 
runs through the city, to keep the crowds down. 
</P>
<P>
	Downtown bars were havens of orange and blue as the Broncos took  
on the Atlanta Falcons. After Denver's 34-19 win, many brought 
their drinks and celebrations outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
	But police were prepared because, last year, about 30,000 people  
gathered downtown after the Broncos beat the Green Bay Packers in 
the Super Bowl. There were more than 25 arrests and 50 people were 
overcome by tear gas after people smashed shop windows, overturned 
cars and set fires in Larimer Square. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have said they believe a relatively small number of  
people were responsible for problems that dog the city after 
championship games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most law-abiding people found the people that were doing that  
pretty disgusting,'' said city spokesman Andrew Hudson. ``It's 
idiotic. It's that kind of behavior that is going to get people 
hurt and get people arrested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police issued warnings to the crowd before they threw the tear  
gas Sunday night. But there was tension between the police and 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Sherwood, 29, said he and his friends were caught off guard  
by the police response. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came down right after the game,'' he said. ``I walked up  
next to a policeman. He said, `Do you think you are safe?' Then 
they tear-gassed us.''

<HEADLINE> 'She's All That' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Teen films continued to rule the box office  
as ``She's All That'' bumped ``Varsity Blues'' from the top spot, 
replacing the high school football tale with a ``My Fair 
Lady''-style campus romance, industry estimates showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's All That,'' the only new film in wide release, grossed  
an estimated $16.8 million for Friday through Sunday, according 
Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie stars Freddie Prinze Jr. as a high school student body  
president who takes a bet to transform an art geek (Rachael Leigh 
Cook) into prom queen. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening total was slightly below the $17.5 million that  
``Varsity Blues'' pulled in when it opened in wide release two 
weeks ago. That movie fell to third place this weekend with $6.2 
million in ticket sales, behind ``Patch Adams,'' which held onto 
the No. 2 spot with $6.8 million after a brief dip a couple of 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Civil Action'' was in fourth place with $4.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Buoyed by major wins at last week's Golden Globes, ``Shakespeare  
in Love'' jumped three spots to No. 5 on just 759 screens. The film 
grossed $4 million for a per-screen average of $5,270, second only 
to the $7,561 for ``She's All That.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare In Love'' won for best comedy or musical film and  
best screenplay while Gwyneth Paltrow was named best actress in a 
comedy at the 56th annual awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are estimated grosses at North American theaters for Friday  
through Sunday. Final figures were expected Monday: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``She's All That,'' $16.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Patch Adams,'' $6.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Varsity Blues,'' $6.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``A Civil Action,'' $4.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Shakespeare in Love,'' $4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``The Thin Red Line,'' $3.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Stepmom,'' $3.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``The Prince of Egypt,'' $3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``You've Got Mail,'' $3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ''At First Sight,'' $2.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Wis. Hero's Story Ends in Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- For a brief moment in May 1996, they were on a  
first-name basis: Oprah and Lafayette. 
</P>
<P>
	Oprah Winfrey had invited Lafayette Clark to appear on her talk  
show, where the 14-year-old recounted his tale of foiling a 
kidnapping near his Milwaukee home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lafayette ... Brave man you were,'' Winfrey told him before  
millions of viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	He came home a hero, a title that sat uneasily upon his thin  
shoulders. He was honored by the police and hailed in the local 
paper. The attention was OK, but the fatherless boy craved the 
acceptance of his peers. 
</P>
<P>
	He craved that acceptance so much that it killed him, his family  
believes. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 10, Lafayette -- now a high school dropout, an absentee  
father, an armed robber -- was accidentally killed by a ``friend'' 
in a botched robbery at a reputed drug house, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafayette Clark, hero, was now Lafayette Clark, statistic. He  
was 17. 
</P>
<P>
	How to explain his precipitous spiral, how it all went downhill  
so quickly? There are no simple answers, but his family thinks that 
Lafayette -- struggling on the slippery slope between adolescence 
and adulthood -- was desperately searching for a place to fit in. 
</P>
<P>
	He just chose the wrong place.  
</P>
<P>
	His family recalls the nerdy teen who did Eddie Murphy  
impressions, who fixed bicycles and gave haircuts to his pals. But 
there was another Lafayette: the wannabe tough guy who quit school, 
fathered three kids by three women and strived to impress the wrong 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	That crowd was unimpressed by his good deeds. ``Good  
Samaritan,'' they sneered. ``Sissy,'' they mocked. And Lafayette 
Clark rose to the bait. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a kid caught between childhood and trying to be an  
adult,'' recalled his uncle, Darron Reed, who tried desperately to 
save the boy. ``He didn't fit in the night life. He was trying to 
be in a place where he didn't fit in. 
</P>
<P>
	``And then the inevitable happened.''  
</P>
<P>
	The inevitable: Live by the streets, die by the streets. If the  
conclusion was inevitable, the rest of Lafayette's tale was by 
turns improbable, heroic, sad and horrifying. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	It was April 28, 1995, and Lafayette Clark, then 13, was  
bicycling home from school. The eighth-grader spotted a boy about 
his age running naked down the street, weeping and trying to pull 
on his clothes. Lafayette asked what was wrong; as the boy 
answered, a man with a gun drove up and snatched the child away. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafayette pulled a school notebook from his back pocket and  
wrote down the car's description and plate number. When the car 
drove off, he followed. When the car stopped and the man took the 
boy into a nearby house, Lafayette wrote down the address. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he pedaled to a phone and dialed 911. The suspect was  
arrested on charges of abduction and armed robbery, and the boy 
returned safely to his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafayette continued home and said nothing about the day's  
events. 
</P>
<P>
	No surprise there. He was not the kind of kid who drew attention  
to himself. 
</P>
<P>
	But word of his good deed spread, and nine months later he  
became the youngest recipient of a police Merit Award, one of only 
two civilians so honored that year in Milwaukee. On May 14, 1996, 
he appeared on the Winfrey show. His family watched proudly. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was calm, not nervous,'' Reed remembered, incredulity still  
in his voice. ``I mean, a kid his age. Talking to Oprah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The boy was invited to join various youth activities around  
town, but his family said nobody ever followed through on the 
offers. The youth and his story soon became yesterday's news. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in his neighborhood, Lafayette's heroism was mocked. Stung  
by the harsh words, he began hanging out with a rougher crowd, 
bidding for street credibility. He was arrested on misdemeanor 
charges for ``small stuff,'' his uncle recalled -- fighting, or 
skipping school. 
</P>
<P>
	The oldest of seven children raised by a single mother, he had  
played basketball, but had balanced it with books. His favorite 
classes had been science, math and social studies. Other kids might 
foster NBA dreams; Lafayette was an aspiring architect. 
</P>
<P>
	But now he became a mere memory at Custer High School. Last fall  
he attended just a handful of classes. He had two children and a 
third on the way -- with three different women -- in three years. He 
survived a street shooting; details of that incident remain sketchy 
even now. 
</P>
<P>
	As Lafayette grew older, his father's absence became an  
ever-larger void. Lafayette would make up stories about gifts and 
visits from his missing dad. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, his mother, Lorraine Allen, left the city for a  
quieter life in Green Bay. Lafayette moved in with his aunt and 
uncle, Darron and Victoria Reed, in a quiet residential part of 
north Milwaukee. His mom hoped Darron would be Lafayette's role 
model. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lafayette became convinced he was a burden. Increasingly, he  
turned to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	One winter's night last month, Lafayette Clark turned the corner  
onto the 2800 block of North 13th Street. He was four miles east of 
his uncle's safe two-family home, and a world away from the Oprah 
Winfrey show. 
</P>
<P>
	The block had seen better days; pigeons roosted in a pair of  
boarded-up houses. Lafayette walked with two friends, headed for 
what they hoped would be a big score at an alleged drug house. 
Authorities gave this version of what happened next: 
</P>
<P>
	The heavily armed trio approached the house, ignoring the  
pointed question posted on its front door: ``What part of no 
trespassing don't you understand?'' Posing as police officers, they 
kicked the door down. 
</P>
<P>
	They ordered the woman inside to lie on the floor, and robbed  
her. Surprised when her fiance burst into the house, the bandits 
fled with $60, a necklace and some rings. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, another surprise awaited: watchdogs. One of the bandits  
opened fire on the dogs, the muzzle flash lighting up the yard. A 
bullet struck Lafayette in the back, tore through his aorta and 
came out his chest. 
</P>
<P>
	He died at 10:03 p.m. at St. Joseph's Hospital. His aunt,  
Victoria Reed, called his mother in Green Bay to deliver the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, at Lafayette's funeral, the Ephesians Church was  
filled with family and friends. A funeral cortege of more than 30 
cars accompanied his body to the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	In the midst of the mourning and weeping, Darron Reed, the  
uncle, took in a heart-rending sight: Lafayette's own kids watching 
their father's funeral. Like Lafayette, they would now grow up 
without a dad. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will never have a chance to know their father,'' he said  
quietly, shaking his head. ``He will never have a chance to know 
his babies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reed paused for a moment, then continued: ``That's the sad part.  
He was just a kid, too.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Former Va. Gov. Godwin Dies at 84 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Mills E. Godwin Jr., a former two-term  
governor regarded as one of Virginia's greatest leaders of the 
century for his work to modernize the education system, died at age 
84. 
</P>
<P>
	Godwin died Saturday night, hours after being released from the  
hospital for treatment of pneumonia, said his nephew, Dr. Webb 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Godwin, elected as a Democrat in 1965 and as a Republican in  
1973, was praised Sunday by leaders of both parties for 
transforming the once largely rural state with a community college 
system and a state sales tax for school improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in his legislative career, Godwin was a principal  
architect of Virginia's massive resistance to school integration, a 
stance that helped him climb the leadership ranks, from a state 
senator in the 1950s to lieutenant governor in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that was the low point of his career,'' said  
University of Virginia government Professor Larry Sabato. ``Is it a 
black mark? Absolutely. Does it define his career? Absolutely 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Godwin later admitted the state waited too long to improve  
education for blacks. As governor, he was credited with 
contributions such as appointing the first black member of the 
state Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabato said Godwin accomplished more in his first term than any  
other Virginia governor this century, especially for the education 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without question, history will assess him as one of the most  
important governors of the 20th century,'' said former Democratic 
Gov. Gerald Baliles. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia bars its governor from serving consecutive terms, so it  
wasn't until 1973 that Godwin ran again. Godwin believed the 
Democratic Party had turned too liberal, joined the GOP and won by 
15,000 votes in one of the state's closest gubernatorial elections. 
</P>
<P>
	In his second term, fiscal problems spawned by the Arab oil  
embargo forced him into spending cuts of more than $200 million to 
balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Godwin is survived by his wife, Katherine, his sister, Leah  
Godwin Keith, three nephews and two nieces.

<HEADLINE> 3 Kids Die in Ohio Duplex Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIMA, Ohio (AP) -- Three children died when fire swept through a  
duplex in this northwestern Ohio city late Saturday, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Killed in the 11:30 p.m. blaze were Crystal Wireman, 10, Heather  
Hernandez, 5, and Donald Sholler, 2, said Carol Ladd, a nursing 
supervisor at St. Rita's Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The children, who apparently had been sleeping, were found  
inside two bedrooms of the apartment, Assistant Fire Chief David 
Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire also injured Joseph Sholler, 25, and his wife,  
Stephanie Sholler, 24, both of Lima, Ladd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Sholler was in critical condition early Sunday at Miami  
Valley Hospital in Dayton, where he was being treated for burns, 
while Mrs. Sholler was in good condition at St. Rita's, hospital 
spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire officials were investigating the cause.  
</P>
<P>
	Lima is about 70 miles southwest of Toledo.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Bank Chief To Talk With IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukraine's central bank chief has left for  
Washington for talks with the International Monetary Fund on a new 
trading band for the national hryvna currency, the bank said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Bank earlier planned to announce new, higher  
margins for the hryvna by Monday, a decision long expected by 
Ukrainian bankers and businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was postponed, however, after an IMF delegation  
left Kiev last week without resuming payments on a vital $2.2 
billion loan, which the former Soviet republic badly needs to be 
able to meet its 1999 foreign debt obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say resumption of the aid is crucial to the National  
Bank, which has only $1 billion in reserves, or about half of what 
Ukraine has to pay foreign lenders in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said last week that if it fails to secure new  
loans this year, it would have to sharply devalue the hryvna to 
raise hard currency for debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The hryvna has remained stable at around 3.43 to the U.S. dollar  
for the past three months, within the government-set trading band 
of 2.5 to 3.5 to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	However, bankers and analysts have increasingly criticized its  
present rate as artificial, saying the currency is bound to fall as 
soon as the National Bank lifts the regulations it imposed on the 
currency market last fall following the financial crisis in 
neighboring Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear how long central bank chief Viktor Yushchenko  
would stay in Washington. A larger Ukrainian government delegation 
was scheduled to visit IMF headquarters later in the week, the 
Interfax news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF froze its three-year aid package to Ukraine in November  
after the government failed to take steps to improve chronically 
poor tax collection and speed up reforms in the key energy and 
agricultural sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Several IMF missions that have visited Ukraine since left the  
country without recommending the continuation of aid.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Sharpe Out With Hurt Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons shut Shannon Sharpe down. They  
could not, of course, shut him up. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe, usually a key element in the Denver Broncos offense and  
the player who has caught more touchdown passes from John Elway 
than anyone else, twisted his left knee in the first quarter of the 
Super Bowl on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	After returning briefly later in the quarter, he was out for the  
rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe was hurt when he was hit on his knee and flipped over by  
cornerback Ray Buchanan's tackle on a 14-yard reception to the 
Atlanta 1. Howard Griffith scored on the next play, giving the 
Broncos a 7-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe, who caught 64 passes for 768 yards and 10 touchdowns  
this season and was voted to his seventh straight Pro Bowl, limped 
off the field after his catch. He returned later in the quarter but 
had a pass bounce off his shoulder pads, and cornerback Ronnie 
Bradford intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe, whose outspoken commentary was a highlight of pre-Super  
Bowl media interviews, went to the locker room at the end of the 
quarter to have his knee retaped but was ruled out of any more 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sore,'' said Sharpe, who nonetheless was able to limp  
into the interview area without assistance while wearing a 
styrofoam horse's head with Broncos insignia. 
</P>
<P>
	``On that play, I bounced off Eugene (Robinson) and then I  
dipped around (Jessie) Tuggle and I saw the end zone. I was trying 
to go upfield and I saw Ray Buchanan coming in, and I thought I 
would try to go over the top. I think he knew that and his helmet 
caught me right in my knee. I wasn't able to get my knee of the 
ground. He got my knee pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was somewhat ironic that it was Buchanan who injured Sharpe,  
since the duo exchanged the most outrageous quotes during the week, 
trading insults and impugning each other's character. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were never any hard feelings,'' Sharpe insisted. ``I  
didn't take it personally because I know he was just getting his 
team ready to play and I was getting my team ready to play. It's 
like a heavyweight fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe said he ``tried to come back but my knee just wasn't  
stable enough. I knew it would do more harm than good to try to 
play on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was undetermined whether Sharpe might require surgery.  
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe said Elway, the Super Bowl MVP, ``played flawless today.  
They say that when you stop Terrell (Davis), you have a chance to 
beat the Broncos. But as I said earlier in the week, if you want to 
stop Terrell, we don't have a problem asking No. 7 (Elway) to throw 
the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weighing in on whether Elway will retire or elect to play  
another season, Sharpe said, ``I think he wants to know that he 
left on top of his game. So many times you see guys hang around 
just trying to squeeze one more year. But I don't really think that 
if he played next year that he would drop off any. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he has made up his mind, one way or the other. But  
he's earned the right to take as much time as he needs to be sure 
of his decision.''

	Some Republicans May Back Clinton  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As House prosecutors prepare to question  
Monica Lewinsky tomorrow, Republican senators said today some of 
their colleagues may vote against removing President Clinton from 
office. House prosecutors have shifted their focus to the 
obstruction charge on the assumption that even among Republicans 
who believe that Clinton lied under oath, there is questionable 
support for the notion that the untruths were serious enough to 
warrant the president's removal, a source said. Meanwhile, the 
White House and senators of both parties expressed dismay at a New 
York Times report that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr is 
considering seeking the president's indictment before Clinton's 
term expires.

	Broncos Lead Falcons 24-6  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Denver Broncos were less sloppy than the  
Atlanta Falcons today and, one play into the fourth quarter, led 
24-6 in pursuit of their second straight Super Bowl victory. The 
third period was scoreless as Atlanta had two turnovers and Denver 
missed two field goals. But on the first play of the fourth 
quarter, fullback Howard Griffith got his second 1-yard touchdown 
run. Denver carried over its sharpness of the first half to the 
opening drive of the third quarter. Ed McCaffrey, blanked in the 
opening 30 minutes, had two receptions for 32 yards on a drive to 
the Atlanta 20. But Jason Elam missed a 38-yard field goal. 

</P>
<P>
	Congress Awaits Clinton Budget  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will send a $1.77 trillion  
budget for 2000 to Congress tomorrow that has lawmakers bracing for 
a yearlong tax-cut fight. With federal surpluses looming larger 
than ever, Republicans say the proposal ignores their call for 
across-the-board reductions in tax rates. The budget projects 
surpluses totaling $2.41 trillion over the decade ending 2009. 
Clinton's plan also assumes the federal government will collect 
$18.9 billion from 2001 through 2004 from settlements the tobacco 
industry has reached with the states, the sources said. But the 
fate of the money is in question because state officials have 
promised to contest federal claims to any portion of the money.

	Explosion Hits Iranian Capital

	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- An explosion broke the windows of a  
residential building in the Iranian capital of Tehran today, the 
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. The Baghdad-based 
Iranian Mujahedeen opposition took responsibility for the blast. 
The fire department said the explosion, which occurred near Shahid 
Hemmat highway, was believed to have been caused by a homemade bomb 
or grenade going off in a building or parking lot, IRNA reported in 
a dispatch monitored in Cairo, Egypt. There was no report of 
casualties.

	Texas Band in Fatal Mexico Crash  
</P>
<P>
	MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) -- Three members of the Texas musical  
group Intocable were killed and six other band members were injured 
today when their speeding station wagon skidded off a highway and 
crashed. The group was on their way from Zapata, Texas, to 
Monterrey, the capital of Mexico's northern Nuevo Leon state, where 
they planned to give a series of concerts, said Jesus Garcia 
Flores, regional commander of the Federal Highway Police. 
Intocable's ranchero and tejano music is popular throughout 
northern Mexico and all along the U.S. border.

	China Leader Backs Market Reforms  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin has backed  
amendments to China's constitution that strengthen support for 
private enterprise, calling them an aid to market reforms, state 
media reported today. The amendments are the third set since the 
constitution was adopted in 1982. They recognize the private sector 
as an ``important component'' of China's state-led economy rather 
than merely ``complementing'' it, according to details released 
today.

	Mediate Wins Phoenix Open

	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Rocco Mediate, who considered  
retirement during two years trying to recover from back surgery, 
shot an unspectacular par 71 to beat Justin Leonard by two strokes 
and Tiger Woods by three at the Phoenix Open today. Mediate started 
six strokes ahead on Woods and seven ahead of Leonard. He finished 
with a 72-hole total of 11-under 273, taking home his third 
championship.

<HEADLINE> Australian Open Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Thomas Enqvist was happy, despite  
losing the final of Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt great,'' he said Sunday. ``I showed everybody I was  
relaxed. I played the same kind of tennis I've been doing all 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Enqvist's 4-6, 6-0, 6-3, 7-6 (7-1) loss to Yevgeny Kafelnikov  
ended a streak of 14 straight wins in Australia this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swede, described as usually ``ice cool,'' was a bit frosty  
when it was pointed out that Kafelnikov thought he hadn't tried 
hard enough and had a history of choking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a lot of fun out there,'' Enqvist said. ``I was not  
nervous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the choking claim, Enqvist said, ``That was not too nice to  
say. I've been playing, before this, 14 matches in Australia, and 
I've been winning them all; so I don't think that's a sign of 
choking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Enqvist was the first Swede to reach a Grand Slam final since  
Stefan Edberg lost at the 1993 Australian Open. The Swedish wave 
started at the 1974 French Open where Bjorn Borg won the first of 
his 11 Grand Slam titles. In addition, Mats Wilander and Edberg won 
13 titles between them. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ANNA'S SPICE:* Anna Kournikova left the Australian Open with  
her first Grand Slam title -- in the women's doubles with Martina 
Hingis. 
</P>
<P>
	She shed a lot of sweat during the tournament, some of which was  
caught on the towels handed over by ``court service attendants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One towel boy said he received several offers for a discarded  
towel used by Kournikova when she played with Hingis. The best 
offer was $63, but the boy declined. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CLEAN SWEEP:* No. 1 seed Kristian Pless made a sweep at the  
Australian Open, beating Mikhail Youzhny 6-4, 6-3 Sunday to take 
both the junior boys' singles and doubles titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old from Copenhagen, Denmark, displayed a strong  
serve and two-handed backhand. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Pless teamed with Austria's Juergen Melzer to win  
the doubles title 6-7 (7-4), 6-3, 6-0 over the Czech Republic's 
Ladislav Chramosta and Michal Navratil. 
</P>
<P>
	The titles were Pless' first in a Grand Slam. He made the  
semifinals of the 1998 U.S. Open in singles and the quarterfinals 
in doubles. He won the World Super Junior Championships last year. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OPEN CONFUSION:* Virginie Razzano became the first French  
winner of the Australian Open girls' junior title, beating 
Slovakia's Katarana Basternakova 6-1, 6-1 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Razzano, seeded 13th, overcame six double faults and 27 unforced  
errors. 
</P>
<P>
	In two years, the 15-year-old Razzano never had reached the  
final 16 in a Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
	Razzano was so excited after the win she confused the title that  
she had won. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible,'' she said. ``It's very difficult for me to  
realize that I have just won the U.S. Open.''

<HEADLINE> Crowds Gassed in Denver After Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Police used tear gas Sunday night to disperse  
crowds downtown after Denver Broncos fans spilled into the streets 
to celebrate a second straight Super Bowl victory. 
</P>
<P>
	In Lower Downtown, bars emptied as the game ended and fans  
started bonfires and set off firecrackers in Larimer Square. When 
the estimated crowd of 1,000 would not disperse, police threw tear 
gas canisters and marched down Larimer Street in riot gear, 
pounding their shields with their clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans scurried away in the smoke, rubbing their eyes.  
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't give us any time,'' said John Giomin of Denver.  
``This really hurts. This really hurts. I've never been gassed 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police issued warnings to the crowd before the tear gas was  
used. But Jeff Sherwood, 29, who moved to Denver two years ago from 
Burlington, Iowa, said he and his friends were caught off guard by 
the police response. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came down right after the game,'' he said. ``I walked up  
next to a policeman. He said, `Do you think you are safe?' Then 
they tear-gassed us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, officers on horseback kept crowds in check.  
</P>
<P>
	At several spots downtown, people waved special editions of the  
Denver Rocky Mountain News and The Denver Post, climbed poles and 
waved pennants. 
</P>
<P>
	As the game ended, police blocked access into downtown from  
Interstate 25, which runs through the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Downtown bars were havens of orange and blue Sunday as the  
Broncos took on the Atlanta Falcons. After Denver's 34-19 win, many 
brought their drinks and celebrations outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, about 30,000 people gathered downtown after the  
Broncos beat the Green Bay Packers in the Super Bowl. There were 
more than 25 arrests and 50 people were overcome by tear gas after 
violence broke out in Larimer Square. 
</P>
<P>
	Police deployed tear gas after people smashed shop windows,  
overturned cars and set fires. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, police had promised a swift response, including tear  
gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have said they believe a relatively small number of  
people were responsible for last year's problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most law-abiding people found the people that were doing that  
pretty disgusting,'' city spokesman Andrew Hudson said. ``It's 
idiotic. It's that kind of behavior that is going to get people 
hurt and get people arrested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police had a chance to test their postgame security plans after  
the Broncos won the AFC championship two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bill Owens, in Miami for the game, said he will return for  
a parade and rally Monday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Scientists: AIDS Came From Chimps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Mystery solved: The AIDS virus came from chimps.  
</P>
<P>
	Experts have wondered about the origin of HIV ever since the  
epidemic emerged almost two decades ago. The uncertainty launched a 
variety of conspiracy theories, some suggesting that AIDS was a 
government plot, created purposely to kill. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, research presented at an AIDS conference Sunday provides  
what scientists say is convincing proof to the contrary: The virus 
got its start in the forests of Africa when humans caught it from 
chimpanzees. In fact, they say the virus has spread at least three 
times from chimps to people. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is absolutely evidence to put (conspiracy theories) to  
rest,'' Dr. Constance Benson of the University of Colorado said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even scientists who scorned those theories have been unsure  
where AIDS actually arose. Some suspected chimps, while others 
thought monkeys or other primates could have been the source. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest discovery was made by Dr. Beatrice Hahn of the  
University of Alabama at Birmingham, who tracked HIV's ancestor to 
a virus that has long infected one of the four subspecies of chimp 
that live in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	She said, ``We conclude that this subspecies is the source of  
the human AIDS virus,'' which now infects about 35 million people 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts believe that HIV -- the virus that causes AIDS -- is a  
recent affliction of people. At last year's Conference on 
Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, Dr. David Ho and others 
from the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center at Rockefeller 
University presented evidence that the virus probably first 
infected humans in the 1940s or early '50s. 
</P>
<P>
	At the opening of this year's meeting, Hahn made the case that  
this event almost certainly occurred in west equatorial Africa. It 
could have happened when someone was bitten by a chimp, or a hunter 
was exposed to contaminated blood while field dressing an animal. 
</P>
<P>
	Hahn said her team nailed down the connection by analyzing  
frozen tissue saved from a chimp named Marilyn that died from 
complications of childbirth at a U.S. Air Force primate center in 
New Mexico 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The chimp version of the AIDS virus is called SIVcpz. It is  
extremely rare among chimps in U.S. labs, perhaps because these 
animals are removed from the wilds as babies and so are never 
exposed to the virus sexually. Until recently, it had been isolated 
only three times. 
</P>
<P>
	Hahn's discovery of the fourth began when a colleague cleaning  
out a lab freezer ran across Marilyn's specimens and sent them to 
her. The researchers performed various kinds of genetic analyses 
that were unavailable at the time the chimp died. 
</P>
<P>
	Marilyn's tissue was found to harbor SIVcpz. The Alabama team  
used molecular analysis techniques to study Marilyn's virus plus 
the other three examples discovered earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	They found that three of the four are about as genetically  
similar to the human AIDS virus as they are to each other. They 
include one gene, called vpu, that is also part of HIV but not the 
other AIDS-like viruses that infect monkeys. 
</P>
<P>
	All three samples were found to have come from Pan troglodytes  
troglodytes, which is one of the four subspecies of chimp in 
Africa. These animals lives in Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Congo 
and Central African Republic, the region where AIDS is thought to 
have started. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth sample was much less like HIV, and it came from  
another subspecies of chimp that is native to East Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	There are three major groups of HIV in people, code-named M, N  
and O. M is the variety that has spread around the world, while N 
and O are seen only in west-central Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	The natural habitat of Pan troglodytes troglodytes perfectly  
overlaps the area where these three groups were first recognized. 
The researchers believe that each group arose from a separate 
chimp-to-human transmission of SIVcpz. 
</P>
<P>
	Hahn said a French team, headed by Dr. Phillippe Mauclere of the  
Pasteur Institute, recently found three more chimps infected with 
SIVcpz at a game sanctuary in Cameroon. One sample has been 
genetically analyzed, and it too closely resembles HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	``That nails it,'' said Hahn.  
</P>
<P>
	Chimps, which have probably carried the virus for hundreds of  
thousands of years, apparently do not get sick from it. Researchers 
say that figuring out why could offer clues for helping people 
fight HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	Hahn's work is being published in this week's issue of the  
journal Nature.

<HEADLINE> Retirees Return to Alma Maters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Eighteen years ago, Reba and Ralph  
Gray found retirement bliss. From their house in Gulf Breeze, Fla., 
they strolled white-sand beaches, cavorted aboard their boat and 
golfed to their hearts' content. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen years later, Gray is 78 and frail from a stroke during  
open-heart surgery three years ago; at age 77, his wife worries 
something catastrophic might happen to her, too. 
</P>
<P>
	So they are retiring again. This time, the destination they're  
focusing on is a place that stole their hearts long ago: dear, old 
Penn State, one of dozens of colleges and universities building 
retirement homes and inviting their far-flung graduates to return. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we remember is a really small school town with a lot of  
love,'' says Mrs. Gray, a Pennsylvania native who graduated in 
1942. She remembers walking around a campus surrounded by gentle 
mountains, picnicking with her visiting parents and hanging out in 
the scarred wooden booths at The Corner Room. Such memories have 
``just kept the glow going,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Nostalgia for the alma mater has helped fill retirement  
facilities at Iowa State, Cornell and Dartmouth. New homes are in 
various stages of development at Duke, Michigan, Alabama, Louisiana 
State and the University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The $125 million Village at Penn State, a retirement complex and  
an attached nursing home, is scheduled to open in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Plenty of retirees are still flocking south for warmer climes.  
But a growing number is bucking that trend. Instead of mild 
winters, they search for the unique blend of small-town safety and 
cultural stimulation that college towns offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can stay busy every minute if you want, or you can stay  
lazy if you want,'' says Catherine MacGregor, who moved to the 
University of Virginia's Colonnades in 1992. She has season tickets 
for women's basketball games, attends shows put on by three 
theaters and volunteers to test drugs for the medical school. 
</P>
<P>
	``The connection to the university makes it more interesting,  
and more challenging,'' says MacGregor, 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy and Glenn Gamble left Penn State in 1961, but they came  
back for alumni events and football games. When they retired, they 
looked up and down the East Coast before it dawned on them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, we just looked at ourselves and said, `Why are we  
doing this? We love State College,''' Mrs. Gamble said. 
</P>
<P>
	What's happening for some is a redefining of life after work.  
</P>
<P>
	``In our culture, retirement has very little value or meaning,''  
says Leon Pastalan, a University of Michigan architecture professor 
who studies how the elderly are affected by their surroundings. 
``We are tied pretty much in terms of our identification to what we 
do. If we're doctors, we're doctors and that's it. So when we 
retire, it's a real downer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Where better than a university -- an institution associated with  
new starts -- to begin a second life? 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of people who are retiring earlier and have a  
lot of energy and are not ready to stop working,'' says Penn State 
President Graham Spanier, who conceived the Village at Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're at a point in their life where they can stop earning a  
paycheck, but these are folks who are still active. I really want 
to take advantage of that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Returning to college won't come cheaply. Entrance fees at Penn  
State are expected to run from $110,000 to $260,000, with 
additional monthly payments of $1,200 to $2,600, for housing 
ranging from small apartments to three-bedroom townhouses. 
</P>
<P>
	And they may not be returning to the places they remember. The  
Grays know State College isn't the sleepy little mountain town they 
knew in the 1940s. They hardly recognized it when they last 
returned, in the 1980s for a football game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very different then, and it's probably more different  
now,'' Mrs. Gray says. ``We would be very startled to go back now. 
But the tug is still there. It's so close to our beginnings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schools with such residential complexes find that all sorts of  
things happen when worldly retirees mix with lively college 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Septuagenarians go to class with teen-age freshmen. Retired  
businessmen teach classes. Researchers and students study aging, 
exercise and even hotel management on a resident population -- a 
sort of in-house lab. University-run hospitals get a new influx of 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, Boca Raton, they have the great weather, the great golf  
courses. They get up in the morning, eat their breakfast, go to 
Wal-Mart or go golfing,'' says Bob Poole, president of S&AMP;A Custom 
Built Homes in State College and one of the Penn State project's 
developers. ``But I'm not sure they're creating things or doing 
things they enjoy doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For universities, the idea is a good fit. In a typical deal,  
Penn State gets $2 million for use of its name, plus $200,000 a 
year for marketing and licensing fees. When all is said and done, 
the university has a new class of philanthropists just a short walk 
from the fund-raising office. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grays' three children, two of them Penn State grads, hope  
their parents will make the leap and return. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids have already said they have dibs on the second room  
for Penn State football weekends,'' she says.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In 1990-91, when UNLV was making a run at an  
undefeated season, the experts all said the Runnin' Rebels would be 
hurt by not having had to win a close game.

	Trailing at halftime for the fourth straight game, the Huskies

	``It's not one of the things we're listing on the chalkboard, to  
get down five and come back,'' Huskies coach Jim Calhoun said of 
the recent deficits his team has overcome against Miami, 
Georgetown, Seton Hall and the Red Storm. ``It's not a good thing 
and one night we will get caught.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun, whose team plays No. 17 Syracuse at Hartford on Monday  
night, isn't consumed with the possibility of an unbeaten regular 
season, something only UNLV team has managed since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just not ready to give it up yet,'' Calhoun said of  
the ``0'' on the right side of the record. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies' start is the best in school and conference history  
and their 16 straight league wins are two shy of the mark they set 
during the 1993-94 and 1994-95 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't read the future,'' Calhoun said of how long the streak  
could go on. ``I know the league race is tight and winning the 
league is what leads to other things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would be the Big East tournament, which the Huskies have  
won three of the last four years, and the NCAA tournament, where 
they have fallen one game shy of the school's first Final Four 
appearance twice in the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you get on the court you never expect to lose,'' said  
Ricky Moore, the team's only senior starter and the defensive 
catalyst in the comeback win over St. John's. ``We know there's a 
long way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Syracuse comes a West Coast trip for a game at No. 3  
Stanford, a team the Huskies beat by 20 points last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talk a lot about `Let's never lose,''' Calhoun said.  
``Someone will have to beat us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Syracuse (15-6, 6-5) has that ability when it plays well, but  
the Orangemen had split their last six games entering Saturday 
night's 76-62 win at Seton Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always good to have one day of preparation for UConn,''  
Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim said, tongue planted firmly in cheek. 
``This will be the second time this season we have played road 
games on a Saturday and Monday. I guess Syracuse doesn't carry any 
weight in this league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orangemen have yet to show, game in and game out, that they  
can beat any team in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coach has been stressing to us that we have to be  
consistent,'' said junior guard Jason Hart, who has matched his 
career high in the last two games with 24 points. ``Sometimes our 
approach to the game isn't where it should be. I think it's a 
matter of maturity. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a good win for us but now we have to go play the No.  
1 team in nation and you never know when you play Syracuse what 
team is going to show up.''

<HEADLINE> Reeves Kept Rolling the Dice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Caution screamed, ``Try something else.''  
</P>
<P>
	Dan Reeves kept rolling the dice.  
</P>
<P>
	Come from where he was six weeks ago, on an operating-room table  
with a failing heart, and there is no such thing as a long shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-and-one early in the game? Go for it.  
</P>
<P>
	Keep sending eight defenders to the line of scrimmage, and keep  
challenging the kid quarterback he taught to be a man to prove he 
still had one great game left? Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought John Elway was a great quarterback when he lost  
three Super Bowls,'' Reeves said after Elway, no longer a kid at 
38, came back to haunt his old coach. ``I'm sure this put a smile 
one put a smile on his face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves ended up on the wrong side of 34-19 Sunday night, on the  
wrong side of the Super Bowl in his fourth try as a head coach. As 
the last few seconds ticked off the clock, he folded his arms 
across his chest, not to stop the hurt in his heart, but to remind 
himself that it was still beating.

<HEADLINE> IOC Seeks New Sports Drug Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- A proposed international agency to  
combat drugs in sports should be run by the head of IOC's medical 
commission, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Samaranch would preside as chairman or president of the  
body, he proposed that day-to-day running of the agency be handled 
by Prince Alexandre de Merode. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my personal opinion, the man running this agency must be  
the president of the medical commission of the IOC, who has been 
doing a very good job for many years,'' Samaranch said during an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	His proposal may cause controversy at the anti-drug summit  
opening Tuesday in Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have called for the group to be fully independent,  
saying the agency would lack credibility if it's run by the IOC, 
especially when the committee is reeling from its worst corruption 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said creation of the ``Olympic Movement Anti-Doping  
Agency'' would be a centerpiece of this week's conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the meeting should also approve a precise definition of  
doping, a single medical code for all Olympic sports and a campaign 
to educate athletes about drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The athletes must understand that doping is a kind of cheating  
that we cannot accept in the world of sports,'' Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency would be responsible for coordinating random,  
out-of-competition drug tests around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, the IOC has been responsible for drug testing only  
during the Olympics. Drug programs outside the games have been left 
to international sports federations and national Olympic bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said it was still uncertain whether the world agency --  
funded largely by Olympic television rights fees -- would be based 
in Lausanne or elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the agency would be made up of experts from the IOC,  
national Olympic committees, international federations, athletes, 
governmental and non-governmental organizations and scientific, 
medical and pharmaceutical groups. 
</P>
<P>
	De Merode, a Belgian, has led the IOC medical commission since  
its inception 30 years ago. Critics outside the IOC contend he has 
been ineffective in combating doping and is out of touch with the 
drug problem today. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, De Merode proposed a major compromise on drug  
sanctions. He called for ``selective'' bans, under which athletes 
would be barred from major international events but allowed to 
compete in minor events. 
</P>
<P>
	This would bring sanctions in line with European right-to-work  
laws, allowing athletes to continue to make a living while serving 
bans. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has recommended a minimum two-year ban for athletes  
found guilty of using steroids or other major drugs. But some 
sports federations argue such a ban would not stand up in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Three federations -- those representing soccer, tennis and  
cycling -- expressed reservations to an Olympic drug resolution 
approved in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand the reservations if they are based on juridical  
problems,'' Samaranch said. ``Our sanctions must be sure to stand 
(in court). Our sanctions cannot go against juridical decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the IOC cannot impose its will on the sports  
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our power over the international federations is very  
limited,'' he said. ``The relationship is based on autonomy and 
respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch defended the IOC's drug policy, saying the  
organization was the first to carry out drug tests, beginning in 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bit by bit, national Olympic committees, international  
federations, and in the last few years, governments also are 
involved in this fight against doping,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's conference was called in the wake of an  
unprecedented spate of drug scandals in the past year, notably 
during the Tour de France cycling race.

<HEADLINE> Missed Chances Doom Falcons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Super Bowl swung on defensive stands by the  
Denver Broncos and missed chances by the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	Six times Denver stopped the Falcons inside the 30, including  
twice on interceptions by Darrien Gordon. Keith Traylor's 
deflection set up one of the interceptions, and he stuffed Jamal 
Anderson on fourth-and-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what you've got to do -- you've got to keep them from  
scoring touchdowns,'' Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski said. ``We 
preach that, and we live it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our stars are on offense, so they're going to get the  
attention. As a defensive player, you realize that's life. But 
defense wins championships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest momentum swing in the Broncos' 34-19 victory Sunday  
came when Morten Andersen hooked a 26-yard field goal attempt wide 
right. On the next play, John Elway hit Rod Smith with an 80-yard 
touchdown pass, giving Denver a 17-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``That takes the air out of your balloon,'' Atlanta receiver Tim  
Dwight said. ``It was kind of a strange game. We established that 
we could move the ball. We just couldn't put six points on the 
board consistently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta had a chance to close the gap in the third period,  
reaching the Broncos' 21-yard line, but Gordon intercepted a Chris 
Chandler pass deflected by Traylor and returned it 58 yards, 
setting up a touchdown to make the score 24-6. 
</P>
<P>
	If not for the tip, Chandler said, the pass might have gone for  
a touchdown to Terance Mathis. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were things there for the taking,'' Chandler said. ``It  
was just unlucky things that happened. A tipped ball -- you never 
plan on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon intercepted Chandler again on the next possession after  
Atlanta reached the Denver 26. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking for that route,'' Gordon said. ``Chandler didn't  
see me, and he threw it right to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon sparked a pass defense that ranked 26th in the NFL during  
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took a lot of criticism as a defense, particularly in the  
secondary,'' he said. ``The bottom line is that we don't give up a 
lot of points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first half, the Falcons ran more plays and had a  
three-minute advantage in time of possession. But they trailed 17-6 
at halftime because four scoring threats produced merely two field 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson was stopped on a fourth-and-1 sweep at the Denver 26,  
and two other times the Falcons drove inside the 15 before settling 
for three points. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta drove 55 yards to the 8 on the first possession of the  
game before Romanowski sacked Chandler on third-and-goal. Andersen 
then kicked a 32-yard field goal for the Falcons' only lead, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	After Denver went ahead 7-3, Atlanta came up with the game's  
first turnover when a pass bounced out of the hands of Shannon 
Sharpe and Ronnie Bradford intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
	The break was good for a first down at the Denver 35, but the  
Falcons failed to take advantage. Glenn Cadrez stopped Anderson for 
no gain on third-and-1, and Traylor stuffed Anderson for a 2-yard 
loss on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing 10-3, the Falcons mounted their best drive of the game,  
moving 65 yards to the 8. But Chris Chandler's third-and-3 pass to 
Dwight sailed high out of the end zone, and Andersen failed on the 
field-goal try. 
</P>
<P>
	The miss ended Andersen's streak of 13 consecutive postseason  
field goals, including a 38-yarder in overtime to beat Minnesota in 
the NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight's 42-yard kickoff return gave the Falcons good field  
position again. They picked up two first downs and had a 
second-and-5 situation at the 11, but two Chandler passes fell 
incomplete, and Andersen then kicked a 28-yard field goal to make 
the score 17-6. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said at halftime, `Let's blow these guys out,''' Romanowski  
said. ``But they kept hanging around until we gave the ball back to 
our offense, and the offense kept doing great things. 
</P>
<P>
	``It comes down to the red zone, and we stopped them from  
getting touchdowns, and that gets frustrating for them. They got 
field goals and it got to them. The frustrating thing to us is they 
kept getting down there. But then we made big plays, and that was 
the key to the game.''

<HEADLINE> Cathay Flight Attendants Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Sporting flight attendant union T-shirts and  
waving signs, more than 50 Cathay Pacific Airways flight attendants 
and a handful of pilots staged a protest Sunday to express their 
dissatisfaction with the company's handling of a new pay deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest, organized by the airline's flight attendants union,  
is the latest effort by attendants to reach a final agreement over 
their pay package. 
</P>
<P>
	Union chairwoman Becky Kwan said the goal of the protest was to  
reopen negotiations with the management. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that there is obviously a communication breakdown  
here,'' Kwan said before boarding an open-top bus, draped in a 
``United we stand, divided we fall'' banner, that was headed to the 
company headquarters at Chek Lap Kok airport. 
</P>
<P>
	In an emergency meeting of about 400 flight attendants Friday,  
the union urged members to refuse to individually sign a new pay 
deal with the company. Union leaders threatened to take their case 
to court but have not been discussing a strike or other such 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight attendants say Cathay management is trying to bust  
their union by refusing to acknowledge its collective bargaining 
power -- something Cathay says does not exist under Hong Kong labor 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	The union agreed last week to a cost-cutting measure that would  
have the flight attendants flying four more hours per month in 
exchange for a 3.5 percent pay increase, but union leaders then 
cried foul when Cathay sought signed agreements from individual 
workers, sidestepping the union. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the carrier's 5,500 flight attendants have signed  
the deal. Some 4,200 are in the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay Pacific says it needs the signatures from individual  
flight attendants under Hong Kong law before it can change their 
working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline is looking to save $35 million per year as it fights  
to bounce back to profitability after being hit hard by Asia's 
financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Marginally Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar dropped against the yen Monday as  
investors bought back the Japanese currency to take profits on the 
greenback's recent rise. Japanese stocks fell slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.52 yen at midday, down 0.46 yen from late  
Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 116.43 
yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 19.10 points,  
or 0.13 percent, to 14,480.15 to close the morning session. On 
Friday, the average closed up 156.93 points, or 1.09 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar fell in Tokyo after Japanese  
exporters and institutional investors bought back the yen to lock 
in profits following the U.S. currency's rise to near 116.50 yen in 
New York on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar surged Friday after the Commerce Department said the  
U.S. economy grew at an astounding 5.6 percent annual rate during 
the final quarter of 1998. Gross domestic product for all of last 
year increased by 3.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 131.27 yen, down  
from 132.45 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese share prices started higher following gains on Wall  
Street Friday, led by a rally in technology, electronics and other 
export-oriented stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Nikkei average drifted down later in the session as  
investors stayed on the sidelines to await details of government 
plan to prevent companies from dumping stocks on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported Saturday that the Liberal  
Democratic Party is considering making Japan Securities Finance Co. 
buy stocks from companies that unwind cross shareholdings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unclear what will happen to stocks after Japan  
Securities Finance buys them,'' said Masatoshi Sato, manager of 
investment information at Kankaku Securities. He said investors are 
hesitant to buy on the report until more concrete details emerge. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 77.50 points, or 0.8  
percent, to 9,358.83 at Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 3.68 points, or 0.33 percent, to 1121.58. 
The TOPIX rose 15.04, or 1.35 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond rose to 2.080 percent from Friday's finish of 1.990 
percent, driving its price down to 97.80 yen from 98.49 yen.

<HEADLINE> Slaney Drug Hearing Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- The arbitration hearing into the drug  
case against Mary Slaney was surprisingly adjourned Sunday until 
April 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Amateur Athletic Federation gave no reason for  
the adjournment. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney's lawyers and the IAAF both agreed to the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was agreed that more time was needed to examine the case,''  
IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said. 
</P>
<P>
	It had been expected that the case in which Slaney was suspended  
then reinstated would be decided early this week. The hearing began 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney, considered the best women's distance runner in U.S.  
history, gave a urine sample during the 1996 U.S. Olympic trials 
that showed a testosterone-epitestosterone (T-E) ratio above the 
6-1 limit. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF suspended Slaney, claiming that USA Track &AMP; Field was  
slow investigating the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	USATF imposed its suspension. But Slaney challenged the ruling,  
and in September 1997, the U.S. federation cleared her. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF later also cleared Slaney to compete, but referred the  
case to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney was world champion at 1,500 and 3,000 meters in 1983.

	BLACKCOMB, British Columbia (AP) -- Michelle Roark won the  
women's division and Olympic silver medalist Janne Lahtela of

<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACKCOMB, British Columbia (AP) -- Michelle Roark won the  
women's division and Olympic silver medalist Janne Lahtela of 
Finland won the men's event Saturday at the World Cup moguls 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Roark earned her first victory on the circuit. The Colorado  
School of Mines College student said she hoped her good fortune 
carries over Sunday in the Super Bowl for the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole family's native Coloradoans and we love the  
Broncos,'' she said. ``So I hope this is a good omen for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roark won with 23.48 points. World Cup leader of Marja Elfman of  
Sweden was second with 23.04 and Kari Traa of Norway was third at 
22.87. 
</P>
<P>
	Lahtela won with 27.45 points, followed by Jean-Luc Brassard for  
Canada with 26.17.

<HEADLINE> Golota Seeks Fight With Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Andrew Golota, winner of five  
straight fights since a 1997 loss to WBC heavyweight champion 
Lennox Lewis, now wants Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	The promotional prospects alone enthralled Golota promoter Dino  
Duva: Tyson, the volatile ear-biter who was banned from boxing for 
a year, against Golota, the low-blow specialist who was twice 
disqualified in 1996 bouts against Riddick Bowe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone acknowledges that would be a tremendous promotion,''  
said Duva, who hopes to make a Tyson-Golota fight by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Golota looked crisp and in control in posting a  
unanimous 10-round decision over journeyman Jesse Ferguson. Though 
he never knocked down Ferguson, Golota (33-3) dominated with strong 
left jabs and punishing overhand rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson, 41, was a late substitute for Jimmy Thunder, who tore  
an Achilles tendon in training and withdrew Wednesday. Ferguson 
signed for the fight Thursday, salvaging the card headlined by 
unbeaten heavyweight Michael Grant. 
</P>
<P>
	When he entered the ring before 2,724 fans in the Convention  
Hall ballroom, the ``Mission: Impossible'' theme boomed from 
loudspeakers. 
</P>
<P>
	It soon became apparent that it was. Ferguson (26-18) fought  
gamely but never seriously challenged Golota nor landed any big 
punches. 
</P>
<P>
	The same could be said about Grant's opponent, Ahmad Abdin, who  
was stopped after 10 rounds of a scheduled 12-rounder against the 
IBC champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, a 6-foot-7, 250-pounder with 28 victories, was fighting  
for the first time in nine months. His previous scheduled bout was 
canceled after he came down with hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
	But his long reach kept Abdin, a former sparring partner, from  
getting close enough to do much damage. And Grant kept the pressure 
on, wearing down Abdin with left jabs. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, of Norristown, Pa., knocked Abdin down with a vicious  
right to the body at the end of the ninth round. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 10th, Grant nailed a charging Abdin with an overhand  
right that dropped him again. Later in the round, he knocked down 
Abdin a third time with a left. Abdin got up at eight, after the 
bell. 
</P>
<P>
	But referee Eddie Cotton, acting on the advice of ringside  
physician Dr. Kenneth Remsen, stopped the fight after the 10th. 
``He was disoriented,'' Remsen said. ``His eyes were rolled up. He 
had a blank stare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdin, of Houston, dropped to 25-2-3.  
</P>
<P>
	Grant said he had no preference about who he would fight next.  
When asked about Golota, he said: ``I think nothing of Andrew 
Golota. He has his own destiny and it's in his hands. I'll leave it 
up to (manager) Don Turner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't turned anyone down,'' Grant said. ``We'll fight  
anyone. We'll fight nine gorillas.''

<HEADLINE> Reeves Kept Rolling the Dice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Caution screamed, ``Try something else.''  
</P>
<P>
	Dan Reeves kept rolling the dice.  
</P>
<P>
	Come from where he was six weeks ago, on an operating-room table  
with a failing heart, and there is no such thing as a long shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-and-one early in the game? Go for it.  
</P>
<P>
	Keep sending eight defenders to the line of scrimmage, and keep  
challenging the kid quarterback he taught to be a man to prove he 
still had one great game left? Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought John Elway was a great quarterback when he lost  
three Super Bowls,'' Reeves said after Elway, no longer a kid at 
38, came back to haunt his old coach. ``I'm sure this one put a 
smile on his face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves ended up on the wrong side of 34-19 Sunday night, on the  
wrong side of the Super Bowl in his fourth try as a head coach. As 
the last few seconds ticked off the clock, he folded his arms 
across his chest, not to stop the hurt in his heart, but to remind 
himself that it was still beating. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no easy way to say how much this one took out of  
Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
	He had quadruple-bypass heart surgery in the middle of December.  
He barely slowed his stride. He was back on the sideline before 
almost anyone noticed he was gone. After all, Reeves had the 
Atlanta Falcons on a roll, had the job he first interviewed for 20 
years ago, and maybe most important of all, he still had something 
to prove. 
</P>
<P>
	A half-dozen years ago, after he'd put in 12 seasons in Denver  
practically raising Elway, Broncos owner Pat Bowlen handed Reeves 
his walking papers. Sunday was supposed to be payback. 
</P>
<P>
	It was, just not for him.  
</P>
<P>
	``They all hurt when you come in and lose. I guess I'm just  
fortunate to be here. You go through that,'' Reeves paused, but did 
not have to elaborate, ``and you get here, well, who knows what 
your chances are?'' 
</P>
<P>
	His musing came out as a question, but the truth is that he  
probably knew the answer going in. 
</P>
<P>
	His chances were not good when he brought the Falcons to Miami  
last week, but they got much worse Saturday night. Safety Eugene 
Robinson, a veteran who was supposed to exert the kind of 
leadership and steadying influence that Reeves is all about, got 
arrested on a downtown street and charged with solicitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Over and over, Reeves was asked how it affected his team. Over  
and over, he kept defending Robinson. ``I don't know anybody that 
hasn't made any mistakes in his life. Our concern all along was for 
Eugene Robinson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next time the question came up, Reeves smacked the table on  
the podium in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the last time I'm going to answer that one,'' he said  
finally. 
</P>
<P>
	He talked to the team late Saturday night, then again before  
they took the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach told us that if we lost this game, it would be the  
ultimate loss,'' linebacker Jesse Tuggle said. ``We worked so hard 
to get to this point. We just didn't respond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was a moment in the second quarter when it was still  
possible, when Denver's lead was just 10-3. Then Falcons kicker 
Morten Andersen missed a 26-yard field goal and Elway brought the 
Broncos to the line of scrimmage and saw eight Atlanta defenders 
still hanging in stubbornly to stop the run, still close enough to 
read his lips. 
</P>
<P>
	He called play-action, rolled to his right and waited for Rod  
Smith to slip past the cornerback and into single coverage against 
Robinson. Then he let it fly. Eighty yards later, Smith rolled into 
the end zone and over the Falcons' chances of winning their first 
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew before the game they were determined to stop the  
run,'' Broncos offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak said. ``We knew we 
were going to have to throw the ball to beat them. It was a little 
more than we expected, but things worked themselves out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kubiak could afford to be modest. Elway finished 18-of-29 for  
336 yards and made nearly every tough throw he had to. He picked up 
the Most Valuable Player trophy afterward, something that could not 
have gone down smoothly with Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
	He was spared that final embarrassment when the crowd around  
Elway swelled to the point where congratulating him proved 
impossible. Reeves, however, was able to catch up with Broncos 
coach Mike Shanahan, who was his assistant in Denver and a key 
player in the drama that got him canned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him congratulations and asked him to pass on my  
congratulations to John,'' Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was calm at the end, bearing no grudges, certain he had no  
regrets, uncertain even whether he would have done anything 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, the second chance Reeves was granted six weeks  
ago was more important than winning any game or setting the record 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody has to be a loser. If you can walk off and feel like  
you've done everything you can, taken all the chances you could, 
then you congratulate the other guys and that's enough,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no problem with that.''

<HEADLINE> Puerto Madero's Win Sets Up Rivalry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Silver Charm's expected coronation never  
happened in the first race of the National Thoroughbred Racing 
Association's new featured series for the handicap division. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Puerto Madero's triumph in the $500,000 Donn Handicap  
might have laid the groundwork for a new rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chilean-bred horse, who shipped in from California on the  
same flight as Silver Charm, showed his credentials to be worthy by 
pulling away to win by 2 3/4 lengths Saturday over Behrens. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, hampered by starting from the outside post in the  
12-horse field, could do no better than third after a furious rally 
down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``My horse ran a big race regardless of what happened (to Silver  
Charm),'' winning trainer Richard Mandella said. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was Puerto Madero's 11th in 16 starts, a better  
percentage than Silver Charm's. But his first 10 races came in 
South America, so there was no way to gauge the quality of 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Since arriving in California less than a year ago, Puerto Madero  
has won three times in six starts and twice finished second to Skip 
Away, the leading candidate for 1998 Horse of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very, very proud,'' jockey Kent Desormeaux said. ``He's a  
handful to hold to the ground. He knows what his job is and he 
wants to get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Madero stalked dueling frontrunners Littlebitlively and  
Sir Bear along the backstretch, then moved to the front when the 
leaders began to tire exiting the far turn. 
</P>
<P>
	``This colt was doing it all,'' Desormeaux said. ``He was within  
himself. The only time I had to hold him in position was going into 
the first turn. He was just biding his time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, unable to cut inside quickly, was forced to lag  
behind the pack and trailed by 10 lengths at one point along the 
backstretch. That left too much ground to make up with his vaunted 
stretch run. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only the second time in 21 starts that Silver Charm has  
finished worse than second. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had to sit there and get sand kicked in his face,'' trainer  
Bob Baffert said. ``But this is just the start of the series. We go 
home now and get ready for the next one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Silver Charm, that will be the Santa Anita Handicap on March  
6, the next race of the NTRA Champions series. It also could begin 
something of a cat-and-mouse game with Puerto Madero. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandella said Puerto Madero probably would skip the Santa Anita  
Handicap, aiming instead for the $5 million Dubai World Cup later 
in March. That's might be another duel with Silver Charm, the 
defending Dubai champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Silver Charm has had losses in the past. He'll bounce back,  
I'll tell you,'' said Bob Lewis, then horse's owner. 
</P>
<P>
	The big gray did move past Alysheba into third place on the  
career earnings list with $6,683,006. But he'll have to run a 
little more to break Cigar's record of $9,999,815. Silver Charm 
would pull within some $316,000 with wins in the Santa Anita 
Handicap and Dubai World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's race drew 21,325 to Gulfstream Park, the largest  
crowd for a Donn Handicap since 1991. It also produced a mutuel 
handle of more than $18 million, the best at Gulfstream for any day 
except those involving the Florida Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a marketing standpoint, this is what it's all about --  
making a big day bigger,'' said NTRA commissioner Tim Smith.

<HEADLINE> Airplanes Are 'Uniquely' American </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airplanes, heavier-than-air machines capable  
of powered manned flight, were the unattainable dream of other 
centuries. They became reality only as the 20th century opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Although many other countries were in the race, airplanes are a  
uniquely American contribution. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the largest historic airplane collection in the world,  
well over 800,'' retired Vice Adm. Donald Engen says as he walks 
through the no-frills warehouse complex in nearby Suitland, Md., 
that is the Smithsonian Institution's Paul E. Garber Preservation, 
Restoration and Storage Facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``It goes back to the Wright brothers' first aluminum cast  
engine,'' says Engen, director of the National Air and Space 
Museum. ``We have Wright engines 1, 6, 8 and 9.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian's aviation collection spans the era from the  
Wright Flyer that made the first manned flight at Kitty Hawk, N.C., 
on Dec. 17, 1903, to artifacts from the exploration of space. 
</P>
<P>
	Like pilots everywhere, when Engen describes his 54 years in the  
air and the characteristics of the airplanes the Smithsonian 
collects, he flies with his hands: tilting, swooping, diving, 
climbing, leveling off. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian first began to free itself from the ground in  
1857 when it sent up balloons to collect weather data. In 1861, 
Joseph Henry, the Smithsonian's first secretary, persuaded 
President Lincoln to support the idea of using balloons as aerial 
military observation posts. 
</P>
<P>
	The institution joined that international race to develop  
heavier-than-air vehicles in 1887. Nine years later, Smithsonian 
Secretary Samuel P. Langley launched an unmanned craft from a 
houseboat on the Potomac River. It flew for 1 1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Artifacts of the air joined the Smithsonian collection even  
earlier, starting with Chinese kites picked up at the Centennial 
Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876. 
</P>
<P>
	Engen can make even an airplane carcass soar, compelling a  
visitor to the warehoused elements of the nation's aviation past to 
look beyond the corroded wings, rust-pocked engines and holes in 
the fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
	As the admiral's hands bank and plunge, he makes a pitch for  
assuring the future of an in-storage collection that includes a 
space shuttle trainer, the oldest B-17 Flying Fortress in 
existence, a World War I Curtiss Jenny, a hulking World War II 
Grumman Hellcat, a Hawker Hurricane from the Battle of Britain and 
historic aircraft from Germany, Japan and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Engen hopes to raise $130 million to help build new exhibit  
space near the runways and roar of Washington Dulles International 
Airport. The Dulles Center of the Air and Space Museum will offer 
state-of-the art restoration facilities and house air and space 
vehicles simply too large or numerous to fit in the present museum 
on the National Mall. 
</P>
<P>
	Exhibits are to include the sleek SR-71 Blackbird, still the  
fastest aircraft ever built, and the giant Space Shuttle 
``Enterprise'' used as a test vehicle in the 1980s. The aim is to 
fully open the new center on Dec. 17, 2003, the 100th anniversary 
of the Wright Brothers' first flight. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Garber facility, some of the airplanes are in pieces,  
with heavily rusted metal parts. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't do something about this collection of ours it's  
going to fall apart,'' Engen says. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the people doing something is Rich Horrigan. He's an  
aircraft restorer, one of 12 at work at the Garber center, named 
for the Smithsonian's first curator of aviation who worked for the 
institution for a startling 72 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Horrigan is at work on a badly deteriorated Folke-Wulf Ta-152,  
the last remaining of 62 planes designed to shoot down Allied 
fighters screening bombers on raids over Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The aft section of the plane, Horrigan explains, was crafted  
entirely of wood by workers in the German piano and furniture 
industries, enlisted into aircraft work after the destruction of 
many aviation plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be able to save it,'' Horrigan says.  
</P>
<P>
	The walk goes on. Engen shows off a fully restored French  
Nieuport 28 from 1917, the airlock module for Skylab, a Korean 
War-vintage Soviet MiG-15 and the Airphibian, a 1950s dream of an 
airplane that was also a car. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby is the Japanese Aichi Seiran M6A1, the last of 24. It was  
designed with collapsible wings to fit in a tube for shipment 
across the Pacific by submarine to bomb the Panama Canal. It never 
left Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there's the Enola Gay, which delivered the atomic bomb  
on Hiroshima. 
</P>
<P>
	The nose, cockpit and front end of the B-29 Superfortress is at  
the museum on the Mall, on display since the cancellation of a 
larger and bitterly contested exhibit about the birth of the 
nuclear age. 
</P>
<P>
	The long aft section of the aircraft fuselage remains at Garber,  
the number 82 painted on its sides, two machine guns poking from a 
rear turret. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be mated with the front when the Dulles Center is  
completed,'' Engen says. ``It will sit front and center in the 
aircraft hall.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Fox Nearly Misses Critical Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Atlanta defense wasn't ready for Rod Smith's game-breaking  
touchdown reception. Neither was Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	The television network nearly missed the crucial second-quarter  
play because of a technical difficulty. They went to a commercial 
three seconds later than scheduled, which resulted in resuming game 
coverage after Denver had already hiked the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 30-second commercial, fans were greeted with John  
Elway already in play-action, ready to unload the long bomb to 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``We almost didn't get back in time,'' said Fox play-by-play  
announcer Pat Summerall. ``Atlanta didn't get back in time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's literally billions of dollars of technical equipment  
here and everything doesn't go perfect,'' Fox spokesman Vince 
Wladika said. ``Pat did an excellent job of recovering and we 
didn't miss the play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The broadcasting duo of Summerall and analyst John Madden,  
working their seventh Super Bowl together, had their good moments -- 
and bad. 
</P>
<P>
	Madden was on the mark when he said the Falcons should take the  
``automatic'' field goal from Morten Andersen instead of going for 
it on fourth-and-1 from the Denver 26 early in the second quarter. 
Atlanta gave the ball to Jamal Anderson, who was stopped for a 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Madden also mentioned that the loss of Shannon Sharpe wouldn't  
affect Elway as much as losing a top target would hurt most 
quarterbacks. Third-string tight end Byron Chamberlain caught a 
pair of key passes early in the second quarter, and both Smith and 
Ed McCaffrey had big games. 
</P>
<P>
	Andersen, however, was far from automatic and he proved that  
later in the first half when he shanked a 26-yarder that would have 
cut the Atlanta deficit to 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Producer Bob Stenner and director Sandy Grossman did a solid job  
of using their record-31 cameras for the telecast, although there 
were no controversial calls in which a replay was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those cameras was certain to catch Elway as he jogged off  
the field for what could be the final time. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Madden nor Summerall, who announced that Elway was the  
Super Bowl MVP with about one minute left, believe that Elway will 
return in an attempt to win a third ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Elway can be the most valuable player for a lot of  
years,'' Madden said. ``He's going to miss the competition and 
playing the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway may be leaving, but Jerry Seinfeld returned to television  
-- in a commercial, of course. 
</P>
<P>
	The game commercials, which cost advertisers $1.6 million for a  
30-second spot, were somewhat of a disappointment. Seinfield's 
anticipated American Express commercial aired during the third 
quarter and Victoria's Secret made its Super Bowl debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Thankfully, the game went by much quicker than the seven-plus  
hour pregame show, which moved about as fast as William ``The 
Refrigerator'' Perry. 
</P>
<P>
	The festivities began at 11 a.m. EST with the kickoff show and  
the preliminary action lasting until Jason Elam's kickoff at 6:27 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta safety Eugene Robinson took some of the focus off the  
game after being charged with soliciting an undercover police 
officer for oral sex, but Fox did a good job not to overdo it. 
While Howie Long tried to defend Robinson and his character, Terry 
Bradshaw disagreed, saying, ``How stupid, how stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was even less discussion of Robinson's incident during the  
game. 
</P>
<P>
	The top segment of the afternoon belonged to Terry Bradshaw, who  
went to Texas to speak to Hollywood Henderson, the former Dallas 
linebacker who 20 years ago said that Bradshaw couldn't spell 
``cat'' even if spotted two letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Their reunion was both informative, humorous and heartfelt.  
</P>
<P>
	``I could spell `cat,''' Bradshaw laughed. ``I don't care what  
you spotted me.''

<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A high-level International  
Monetary Fund delegation began talks with Brazilian officials 
Sunday to revise the country's economic policy, two weeks after the 
government devalued its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil is hoping to meet requirements for the Washington-based  
IMF to release another $9 billion installment in February of a 
$41.5 billion package to rescue the economy from its crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an IMF statement, the delegation will ``establish a  
new macroeconomic and monetary framework.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Brazil's Central Bank ended a fixed exchange rate in  
December, the nation's currency, the real, has lost 41 percent of 
its value against the dollar and more than $8 billion has left the 
country. The nation's currency reserves are said to be $36 billion.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The girl from Ipanema may still be  
tall, tan and lovely but she is afraid to walk down the street. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, about 1,000 irate residents of the famed upscale  
beach community of Ipanema in Rio de Janeiro took to the streets to 
protest a recent spate of muggings, armed robberies and homicides. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the recent violence is caused by youth gangs that sell  
drugs, vandalize property, threaten motorists at traffic signals, 
hassle women and beat men they believe are homosexuals, according 
to a recent police report. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters included victims of muggings, store owners, human  
rights groups and local politicians. They waved banners with 
slogans such as ``end impunity'' and ``homophobia is a crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The recent crime wave has prompted many store owners to hire  
private security guards and a neighborhood merchants' association 
has offered to buy radios and other equipment for the city's 
ill-equipped police force. Furthermore, many Ipanema residents are 
indoors by 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's as if we are living with an imposed curfew,'' Arao  
Pomeraniec, building manager for the Quartier Ipanema shopping 
complex, told the Rio newspaper Extra Sunday.

	MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) -- Suspected members of an Egyptian  
terrorist group were arrested at Uruguay's border with Brazil, the 
minister in charge of domestic security said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Uruguay's Interior Minister Guillermo Stirling did not disclose  
the names of the alleged terrorists arrested Friday, who are 
reportedly wanted by several nations. 
</P>
<P>
	According to El Pais newspaper, the arrests came after the CIA  
warned Uruguayan authorities that members of an Egyptian terrorist 
group called Al-Gama'At were traveling to London via Brazil on 
false passports. 
</P>
<P>
	The police arrested an Egyptian couple traveling with three  
children, all of whom had false Malaysian passports. Also arrested 
was a Jordanian, who is a naturalized citizen of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	El Pais reported Sunday that the Egyptian intelligence ministry  
had congratulated the Uruguayan police for the arrests.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuelan authorities stepped up  
security Sunday before the arrival of 16 heads of states expected 
to attend former leftist coup leader Hugo Chavez's inauguration as 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentine President Carlos Menem, Cuban President Fidel Castro  
and Colombian President Andres Pastrana were among the leaders 
scheduled to attend Chavez's swearing in on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In November 1997, anti-Castro extremists allegedly were plotting  
to assassinate him during a regional summit meeting on Venezuela's 
Margarita Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, who led a failed coup attempt in 1992, won a landslide  
victory in elections on Dec. 6. He is admired by the poor who see 
him as a hero who will fight corruption and poverty, but feared by 
the rich who think he will install a dictatorship.

<HEADLINE> IOC Prepares for Doping Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- International Olympic Committee  
leaders are lashing back at their critics as they turn from one 
ethical crisis to another. 
</P>
<P>
	Still reeling from the worst corruption scandal in its 105-year  
history, the IOC is pressing ahead this week with a world summit on 
fighting performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have questioned whether the IOC has the ethical  
authority to lead the anti-doping fight while its own standards are 
under attack. 
</P>
<P>
	But IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and his deputies,  
concerned the drug conference is being overshadowed by the scandal, 
took pains Sunday to dispel that notion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This outfit is not in disarray,'' executive board member Kevan  
Gosper of Australia said. ``This outfit is managing itself through 
one of the most serious crises in its history. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it carries the authority on all matters relating to  
Olympic sports, and that includes the overseeing of this 
anti-doping conference. There is only one authority and one 
organization capable of doing it and that's us, and that's why 
we're doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's credibility remains at stake at the 2 1/2-day doping  
conference opening Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the main goals of the meeting is to approve the creation  
of an international agency to coordinate drug-testing programs 
worldwide. But there's likely to be controversy over the IOC's role 
in the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch on Sunday said he would oversee the agency and  
proposed that IOC medical commission chief Prince Alexandre de 
Merode run the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my personal opinion the man running this agency must be  
the president of the medical commission of the IOC, who has been 
doing a very good job for many years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	De Merode, a Belgian, has led the IOC medical commission since  
its inception 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have called for the world agency to be fully  
independent, saying the body would lack credibility if it's run by 
the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said it was still uncertain whether the world agency --  
funded largely by Olympic television rights fees -- would be based 
in Lausanne or elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the conference should also approve a precise  
definition of doping, a single medical code for all Olympic sports 
and a campaign to educate athletes about drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, he said he was ``astonished'' at the vitriol of the  
attacks against him in the world's media, including the ``rubbish 
that is said in some papers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So many silly things are coming,'' he said. ``Who can produce  
all this news?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch cited a Swedish report that he lives in a villa and  
flies by helicopter every day to IOC headquarters. In fact, 
Samaranch resides in a hotel suite in Lausanne and travels by car 
to his office. 
</P>
<P>
	He also recounted that a Japanese paper accused him of  
frolicking with geisha at a ``huge party'' at a hotel in Nagano at 
the close of the 1998 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``First of all, I was with my wife,'' Samaranch said. ``And  
second, I am 78 years old. I am not of the age to have parties with 
geisha girls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite calls from outside the IOC for his resignation,  
Samaranch reiterated he will stay as long as he has the support of 
the committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	``My obligation is to stay and to put all my efforts to get back  
the prestige that the IOC had during the last years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old Spaniard, who has led the IOC since 1980 and  
whose final term ends in 2001, will put his leadership to a vote of 
confidence at a special general assembly March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe some people they are very tired to see me as president  
after 18 years, mainly some people outside the IOC,'' Samaranch 
said. ``But I would like to repeat: I put my position to the IOC 
members. It is up to them. My position belongs to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch wouldn't predict the outcome of the vote but said, ``I  
can assure you I have received many telephone calls, many letters 
from IOC members. Until now, they all are supporting me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he was confident the general assembly would  
support the recommendations of the executive board to expel six 
members for alleged misconduct stemming from Salt Lake City's 
winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine have either resigned or been expelled, three remain under  
investigation and one received a warning. Other members could be 
implicated as the investigation continues.

<HEADLINE> New Theory on Asia-America Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Rummaging through the fossil-filled basement of the California  
Academy of Sciences' National History Museum two years ago, curator 
Louie Marincovich Jr. made one of those serendipitous finds that 
mark the annals of science -- a mixture of luck, intuition and 
persistence. 
</P>
<P>
	In a stash of fossils excavated from a ridge of ancient ocean  
rocks rising high above the Alaskan Peninsula, he came across the 
carefully labeled fossils of a North Atlantic clam called Astarte. 
</P>
<P>
	But the clam shouldn't have been there. It was several million  
years old, much older than any similar clam found in the North 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	Marincovich had stumbled across evidence that the Bering Strait  
land bridge -- that famous strip of land that humans and a parade of 
other animals migrated across -- had been breached by ocean waters 
far earlier than scientists had thought. And that meant 
Arctic-Atlantic and Pacific marine animals were commingling at a 
much earlier date. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here I am in the basement of the California Academy of  
Sciences in San Francisco and I have in my hand evidence for the 
early opening of the Bering Strait. I'm thinking, `Gee, the Bering 
Strait is open,''' said Marincovich, an adjunct curator of 
paleontology at CAS's department of invertebrate zoology and 
geology. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen years earlier, Marincovich had visited the same  
windswept site in southwest Alaska where the fossils had been 
collected, a brutally raw and beautiful area known as Sandy Ridge. 
As he climbed the 800-foot ridge, he had noticed that at a certain 
point, warm water clams appeared to have given way to a cold water 
species. 
</P>
<P>
	It was just a thought, but it stuck in his mind until he  
happened across those carefully labeled Astarte fossils. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a return to Sandy Ridge last summer to collect and  
date more fossils, Marincovich and a Russian co-author published 
their findings in the Jan. 14 issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	They presented convincing evidence that the Bering Strait had  
opened 1 to 2 million years earlier than previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists had estimated that the land bridge submerged 3 to 4  
million years ago, allowing the mixing of Pacific and 
Arctic-Atlantic ocean waters for the first time in about 100 
million years and halting land migration of animals between Eurasia 
and North America. 
</P>
<P>
	But the clam finds push the opening back to about 5 million  
years -- between 4.8 and 5.5 million years ago. And there's 
tantalizing evidence the clams were present as early as 7.4 million 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings have ramifications for land and marine animal  
migration and the climate of the North Pacific, which became colder 
as the Arctic's chillier waters were free to spill southward. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very significant,'' said Julie Brigham-Grette, an  
associate professor of geology at the University of Massachusetts, 
Amherst. ``When you open the Bering Strait it means putting in 
touch two bodies of water that haven't flowed together for a long 
period of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we know the timing of the Bering Strait's submergence we  
can place that in the right order of climate changes -- when did we 
get the modern oceanic system and when did the climate allow the 
Northern Hemisphere to begin to go through the modern period of 
glaciation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists believe the ice cap that covers much of the Arctic  
Ocean formed about 2.6 million years ago, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brigham-Grette said Marincovich's findings support research  
published a year ago by Russian scientists and Michigan State 
University researchers who found that the ocean floor beneath the 
Bering Sea is actually a huge tectonic plate rotating clockwise 
relative to the North American plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Brigham-Grette said that research suggests the plate's motion  
would have opened the Bering Strait between 5 and 6 million years 
ago -- about the same time as suggested by Marincovich's work. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's pretty exciting to find two different disciplines  
discovering the same thing from two different points of view,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After his basement find in 1997, Marincovich applied for and  
received funding from the National Science Foundation for a 
three-year project to confirm those findings. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, he returned to the remote Alaskan peninsula about  
600 miles southwest of Anchorage with two Russian colleagues. They 
stayed at a hunting camp 15 miles from the fossilized layers of 
ancient ocean sediment. 
</P>
<P>
	When the weather cooperated, a helicopter dropped them off each  
morning along the rocky ridge for a 10-hour day of chipping out the 
grayish Astarte clams and other specimens from the blackish 
bedrock. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Ridge, at an elevation of 1,000 to 2,000 feet, is known  
for its tempestuous weather. Though the midsummer temperatures were 
in the relatively balmy 30s and 40s, it could be clear and calm one 
minute, then a few minutes later the wind might be howling at 100 
mph, accompanied by the dense, smoke-like fog that often rolls in 
without warning from the Bering Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Marincovich and his colleagues would take shelter in the  
downwind quiet of boulders until the winds subsided and their work 
could resume. By day's end, their backpacks might tip the scales at 
80 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	But it wasn't all work.  
</P>
<P>
	Some days, when the skies cleared, they stood in awe of a huge  
glacier-topped volcano 10 miles away venting gases that tinged the 
air with a taste of sulfur. 
</P>
<P>
	``On a quiet day you could hear the glaciers moving. They kind  
of make a distant boom like artillery. You might see a caribou or a 
moose foraging. It was really strange, you can't believe you're 
there. It's so remote and so beautiful,'' Marincovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the American-Russian trio will return to Sandy Ridge.  
They are hopeful they can pinpoint the date of the land bridge's 
opening and possibly when tectonic forces or falling sea levels 
closed it up again. 
</P>
<P>
	Samples of volcanic dust taken from the layers where they found  
the clams may pin down the mollusks' ages to within 10,000 years, 
Marincovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	The project has given him an opportunity to work with three  
Russians -- Konstantin Barinov and Andrey Y. Gladenkov, both 
paleontologists with Moscow's Russian Academy of Sciences -- and 
Anton Oleinik, a paleontologist at Florida Atlantic University in 
Boca Raton, who is now a naturalized American. 
</P>
<P>
	Barinov and Oleinik, who added fossils they had collected from  
the Russian side of the Bering Sea to the research, accompanied 
Marincovich to Sandy Ridge. Gladenkov stayed behind in Moscow 
awaiting the return of the specimens; an expert in tiny ocean algae 
called diatoms, he dated the clams by studying the microfossils in 
the sediment around the clams. 
</P>
<P>
	Little more than a decade ago, such Russian-American scientific  
cooperation would have been almost impossible. The two countries 
were isolated by the Cold War, much like the Bering Strait now 
separates Siberia and Alaska with 50 miles of shallow ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Marincovich recalls a 1976 international conference on rocks and  
fossils he attended in Tokyo. During the conference, he spoke with 
Gladenkov's father, Yuri Gladenkov, also a paleontologist. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked wistfully about how we wished we could work  
together, but we couldn't because there was always the Cold War,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s, the collapse of the Soviet Union broke down  
the political barriers that had kept Russian and American 
scientists from sharing their research and ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of one of those subplots of the end of the Cold War.  
And it's appropriate that the age of the Bering Strait is being 
determined by scientists from the two nations separated by the 
Bering Strait,'' Marincovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Bering Strait is best known as the route for human  
migration between Eurasia and North America, the new findings about 
its early opening have no bearing on mankind's arrival in North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Modern humans are believed to have reached North America during  
the last ice age, possibly as late as 30,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The land bridge, which despite its name wasn't narrow -- it was  
about 1,000 miles wide -- repeatedly opened and closed over the 
millennia. It last closed 11,000 years ago, when meltwater at the 
end of the ice age dramatically raised sea levels worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one more piece of a big jigsaw puzzle that helps us  
estimate the migrations of animals in either direction,'' said 
David Hopkins, a retired distinguished professor of geology at the 
University of Alaska, in Fairbanks. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Repenning, a retired geologist with the U.S. Geological  
Survey who has studied the migration of field mice across the land 
bridge, said precise dates of the bridge's rise and fall would 
influence theories about when larger animals migrated between the 
two sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``All sort of animals came across. Camels and the predecessor of  
the modern horse originated in North America and migrated across 
many times before they went extinct in North America,'' said 
Repenning, a research associate with the Denver Museum of Natural 
History. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the more interesting things is the animals that didn't  
come across. The woolly rhinoceros, for example. It's been found on 
the Asian side of the strait, but never in North America. Nobody 
really knows why.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: Most Oppose Tossing Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three new polls suggest a majority of  
Americans haven't changed their minds about impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as House prosecutors ready their interviews with Monica  
Lewinsky, and the Senate ponders how to end President Clinton's 
trial, weekend surveys by Newsweek, the Los Angeles Times and The 
Washington Post found that nearly two-thirds of Americans don't 
want the president removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	And a majority said they disapprove of the Senate's decision to  
hear new testimony from Ms. Lewinsky, presidential friend and 
adviser Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-five percent of those polled by the Los Angeles Times  
opposed a Senate vote to convict Clinton and remove him from 
office, against 29 percent who favored his removal. Newsweek, with 
65 percent to 28 percent, and The Washington Post, 64 percent to 33 
percent, mirrored the findings. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls have consistently found that roughly six in 10 Americans  
want Clinton to stay in office despite accusations that he tried to 
cover up an affair with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Senate's party-line vote last week to let  
impeachment prosecutors from the House take new testimony from the 
three witnesses, the Los Angeles Times said Americans, by a margin 
of 60 percent to 37 percent, felt that is unnecessary. Newsweek and 
the Post had similar, if less authoritative, findings of 48 percent 
to 47 percent, and 52 percent to 47 percent respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times survey also reported that by 59 percent to  
36 percent, Americans think congressional Republicans have put 
Clinton on trial primarily to hurt the Democratic president rather 
than in the interest of the nation's moral and legal well-being. 
</P>
<P>
	And Newsweek said 54 percent of Americans think the GOP has been  
hurt by the impeachment proceedings, against 9 percent who said the 
party was helped and 29 percent who say the GOP has not been 
affected by it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times poll questioned 960 adults across the  
country Jan. 27-29 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 
percentage points. The Newsweek poll surveyed 751 adults Jan. 28-29 
and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The 
Washington Post's poll was taken Jan. 28-30 and has a margin of 
plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Davis' Versatilility Helps in Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Even as a decoy, Terrell Davis had a super impact.  
</P>
<P>
	When he wasn't running the ball or catching it, he was setting  
the Atlanta Falcons up for the kill. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis carried 25 times for 102 yards and caught two passes for  
50 yards in the Denver Broncos' 34-19 win over Atlanta in the Super 
Bowl on Sunday. But it was what he did without the ball that proved 
just as significant. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest play of the game came when quarterback John Elway  
and Davis pulled off a perfect run fake on a play-action pass. The 
trickery froze the Atlanta secondary, which had devoted its 
defensive game plan to stopping Davis, and Elway threw an 80-yard 
touchdown pass to Rod Smith to put the Broncos ahead 17-3 in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mind being a decoy at all,'' Davis said. ``It doesn't  
matter. I'll do what I need to do to help this team win 
championships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Davis was the Super Bowl MVP as the Broncos beat  
Green Bay 31-24. On Sunday, he was perfectly content to let Elway 
get all the glory. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting off leg cramps and an initially unyielding Atlanta  
defense, he turned in a fine all-around performance that, in other 
years, might have been worthy of MVP honors. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the 38-year-old Elway capturing that award, Davis  
starred in a supporting role. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of key people on this team,'' said Davis, the  
league's MVP during the regular season after rushing for 2,008 
yards. ``I'm just a piece of the puzzle. When you stop our running 
game, you have to deal with our passing game. John was really on 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to expectations that Elway might retire, Davis said,  
``This would be a storybook ending for him if he decides to leave 
the game. But, hopefully, he'll come back for one more year and we 
can see if we can win it three times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Davis' seventh straight 100-yard rushing game in the  
postseason, an NFL record. He and Washington's John Riggins had 
been tied with six in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a heck of a game,'' Atlanta coach Dan Reeves said of  
Davis. ``I've never seen anybody break so many tackles. They can 
really spread the ball around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said the Broncos' second straight Super Bowl title ``was a  
lot better than the first. At least to me, this one was sweeter. To 
go through this season having to fight every game and knowing that 
you had a big target on your back was tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who ran for 157 yards and three touchdowns in last year's  
Super Bowl, had only 18 yards on six carries in the first quarter 
against the stubborn Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the first couple of carries, they let me know it was going  
to be a long day for me,'' he said. ``But I had a mindset coming in 
that it was going to be a very physical game. What really slowed me 
down was that I was cramping up the entire game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he cranked it up on a drive that led to a field goal and a  
10-3 lead early in the second quarter. He had runs of 8 and 13 
yards, and then added 6 yards with a nifty spin move to elude 
Falcons end Chuck Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a 15-yard gain late in the half as the Broncos took a  
17-6 lead at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
	In a scoreless third quarter, Davis, a secondary receiver,  
caught a short pass from Elway and turned it into an 11-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the quarter, he broke an attempted tackle by linebacker  
Jessie Tuggle and reversed his field for an 11-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the final period, Davis caught a short pass off the  
left side. Breaking tackles and maintaining his balance along the 
sideline, he turned it into a 39-yard gain to the Atlanta 9-yard 
line. Two plays later, Elway's 3-yard run on a quarterback draw put 
the Broncos ahead 31-6 with 11:20 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, he was not the primary receiver.  
</P>
<P>
	``We noticed on film that every time we did play-action pass,  
their linebackers would run out,'' Davis said. ``So I just stepped 
up into the zone to just be an outlet for John. There was no one 
there.''
