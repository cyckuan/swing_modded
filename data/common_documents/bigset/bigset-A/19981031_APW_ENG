	   CHICAGO (AP) _ The Chicago Fire topped off their MLS Cup
championship with the U.S. Open Cup title Friday.
	   Frank Klopas' goal in the first overtime lifted the Fire to a
2-1 victory over the Columbus Crew on a rainy night at Soldier
Field.
	   ``It's an awesome feeling, especially after coming off winning
the (MLS) Cup Sunday. It unbelievable feeling to top it off with
this win in front of our home fans,'' said Chicago goalie Zach
Thornton, who saved five of six shots.
	   The U.S. Open Cup competition involves Major League Soccer teams
but is conducted separate from the league championship, which the
Fire, playing in its first MLS season, won on Sunday with a 2-0
victory over D.C. United at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif.
	   Klopas, a Chicago native who played for the Crew last season,
took a pass on a header by Ante Razov after a corner kick from
Jerzy Podbrozny in the 99th minute.
	   ``I just got in front of the defender ... My first touch was
good. I was so close. I just placed the ball into the corner,''
Klopas said. ``It was really a magical night for me.''
	   The Crew's Stern John had tied the game in the 53rd minute.
	   Podbrozny's penalty shot during injury time in the 45th minute
gave Chicago a 1-0 edge at halftime. Podbrozny also scored in the
MLS title game.
	   Defenseman Lubos Kubik was injured early in the match and the
Fire, who didn't have any defensemen on the bench, had to send in a
midfielder Josh Keller as a substitute and Peter Nowak switched to
defense.
	   ``We were worried because we were shorthanded and Nowak had to
play back there. So we were happy to be ahead at the half,'' said
coach Bob Bradley.
	   Midway through the first half, Columbus' Brian McBride, a
Chicago-area native, just missed a bicycle kick a few feet in front
of the Fire net.
	   Afterward, McBride just wanted to talk about the game-winner.
	   ``Frank was in the right place at the right time _ that's what
it is all about in games like this,'' McBride said.
	   The Crew had lost to United two games to one in the MLS' Eastern
Conference finals.

Russia's Butyrskaya wins women's short program at Skate America
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Russia's Maria Butyrskaya fell onto the ice but
not out of favor with Skate America judges Friday night.
	   Despite tumbling while attempting a triple lutz during the
women's short program, the bronze medalist at the world
championships still scored straight 5.7s for presentation in taking
over the lead in the international event.
	   ``I followed very strong and good in practice here and also
during the warmup,'' Butyrskaya said after the short program, which
accounts for one-third of the total score. ``I was very secure, and
maybe too much. Maybe this prevented me from focusing.''
	   Angela Nikodinov of the United States was second after skating a
clean program that included a triple lutz-double toe combination
during a routine to the music of Vaughn Williams' ``A Lark
Ascending.''
	   ``I just had a little problem with my footwork,'' Nikodinov
said. ``It kind of slowed me down and threw me off my timing. So it
didn't get the lift it usually does.''
	   Russia's Elena Sokolova, also among the few women to complete a
combination jump Friday night, was third entering Saturday's
decisive free skate. Nicole Bobek, the 1995 U.S. champion, fell on
her triple flip and was fourth.
	   France's Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizert, runners-up in this
year's world championships and Olympic bronze medalists at Nagano,
retained first place in ice dancing after their original dance
Friday night.
	   ``We felt well,'' Peizerat said. ``We felt good about our
performance tonight.''
	   Russia's Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh, second heading into
the original dance, stayed in second place. Barbara Fusar-Poli and
Mariusz Margaglio of Italy finished third.
	   Americans Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev, fifth after Thursday
night's compulsories, dropped to sixth after Tchernyshev fell
during their routine Friday night.
	   Tchernyshev called the tumble ``just a fluke, probably a
miscalculation of distance between us.''
	   The original dance is worth 30 percent of the skaters' total
score.
	   The event concludes Saturday with free skates in the men's,
women's and pairs competitions, as well as the free dance.
	   As the first event in the International Skating Union's Grand
Prix series, Skate America features Olympic-eligible skaters. The
series culminates with a final in Russia in March, two weeks before
the world championships in Finland.

Taiwan loses another diplomatic ally, Tonga, to China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNIE HUANG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Signaling another diplomatic setback,
Taiwan on Saturday said it will sever ties with Tonga and accused
the South Pacific kingdom of ``succumbing to the enticement'' of
forging official relations with China.
	   Tawianese Foreign Ministry spokesman Roy Wu said Tonga had
decided to switch its recognition to Beijing on Monday, despite
Taiwan's efforts to maintain a 26-year-old diplomatic relationship.
	   The spokesman blamed China for trying to isolate Taiwan and
undermine recent improvements in relations between Taipei and
Beijing.
	   ``The Chinese communist regime has never ceased its efforts to
restrict our international living space,'' Wu told reporters.
	   ``It indicates the Chinese communist authorities have no
sincerity in improving relations with us,'' he said.
	   Tonga will be the fourth country to switch diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing so far this year, following the
lead of South Africa, Central African Republic and Guinea-Bissau.
The move will shrink Taiwan's list of allies to 26.
	   Coming just two weeks after a watershed meeting between the top
negotiators from Taiwan and China, the diplomatic squabble over
Tonga could hurt efforts to thaw relations between the rival
governments.
	   During a visit by Taiwanese envoy Koo Chen-fu to China, the two
sides vowed to seek to narrow their differences over restoring
dialogue China broke off in 1995 in anger over a Taiwanese drive to
gain international recognition.
	   Taiwan and China split politically in 1949 and China considers
Taiwan a renegade province with no right to independent relations
with foreign governments.
	   The two have used financial aid, technical support and private
investment to lure away each other's allies.
	   Taiwan's Premier Vincent Siew visited Tonga in July to celebrate
the birthday of King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV. During the trip Taiwan
agreed to build several poultry farms and a feed factory.
	   But China upped the ante by promising a grant to help Tonga
build a commercial satellite, according to Taiwanese officials.
	   On Friday, Taiwanese newspapers reported the Taiwan government
won a lawsuit against Niger demanding the West African nation to
pay back a U.S. dlrs 50 million loan which it received after
recognizing Taipei in 1992.
	   Niger had switched its recognition back to Beijing four years
later.

NEW YORK: three games.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Panthers 7, Blackhawks 3 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In Chicago, Rookie Mark Parrish scored four goals and Rob
Niedermayer added two more to help the Florida Panthers snap a
five-game winless streak.
	   Florida, which had scored a league-low 12 goals in its seven
previous games including the 0-2-3 streak, led 3-0 after one
period.
	   Bob Probert, Doug Gilmour and Doug Zmolek scored for Chicago,
which has been plagued by slow starts so far this season.
	   Blackhawks starting goaltender Mark Fitzpatrick, who played 4{
seasons for Florida, was replaced by Jeff Hackett at the start of
the second period after allowing three goals on eight shots.
 &UR; Stars 3, Mighty Ducks 3
	   In Dallas, Steve Rucchin and Teemu Salanne scored goals over a
26-second span in the final minute of regulation as the Anaheim
Mighty Ducks rallied for a tie with the Dallas Stars.
	   Dallas had built a 3-1 advantage with 1:40 to play on Jere
Lehtinen's wrist shot from the right circle.
	   But the Mighty Ducks, with an extra attacker for goaltender Guy
Hebert, narrowed the deficit to 3-2 on Rucchin's second goal of the
season at 19:22. Selanne sent the game into overtime with his fifth
goal of the season at 19:48 from in front of the net.
	   Dallas' Joe Nieuwendyk continued his strong start after six
months of rehabilitation from double-knee surgery with two goals,
including the 400th of his career.
 &UR; Capitals 0, Flames 0
	   In Calgary, Alberta, Washington goaltender Rick Tabaracci made
20 saves in his return to Calgary to help the injury-riddled
Capitals earn a tie with Ken Wregget and the Flames.
	   In a matchup featuring the Flames' No. 1 goalie this season and
his predecessor from last season, Wregget was busier with 27 saves,
but neither goalie needed to be spectacular in recording his first
shutout of the season.
	   The Capitals were missing eight regulars from their lineup.
	   Washington had reacquired Tabaracci, who played 42 games with
Calgary last year, in the offseason for future considerations.

Atherton, Stewart out of tour match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ England's top two players Alec Stewart
and Mike Atherton were ruled out of the opening first-class match
of the Ashes tour of Australia on Saturday.
	   Captain Stewart has not recovered from the back spasm which he
suffered in a limited overs match Thursday while former skipper
Atherton is out with a hip injury.
	   Nasser Hussain took the helm for the four-day match against
Western Australia at the WACA ground as the tourists downplayed the
injury worries.
	   ``Stewart's back was a little bit stiff. Atherton has deep
bruising in his hip,'' a team spokesman told reporters. ``He's in
no discomfort while batting but it wasn't worth the risk of getting
sore again when he's running around the field.''
	   Both players have a history of back troubles and despite the
official assurances it is a far from encouraging start to the
five-test tour.
	   Ben Hollioake and Dean Headley have also experienced injuries
since the team arrived last week.
	   Western Australia batted first in Saturday's match and was 59
for two at lunch. Test No.3 Justin Langer was unbeaten on 28.
	   England had a great start when it claimed the wickets of openers
Ryan Campbell and Michael Hussey in consecutive deliveries with the
score on four.
	   Yorkshire fast bowler Darren Gough struck first when he beat
Campbell for pace and trapped the dashing righthander lbw with a
fullish delivery that moved slightly into the batsman. Next ball,
paceman Alan Mullally, who played Sheffield Shield cricket for
Western Australia had Hussey caught in slips.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Aboriginal athlete Nova Peris-Kneebone
will start the Australian leg of a torch relay which will involve
some 10,000 others before a mystery participant lights the flame to
launch the Sydney 2000 Olympics.
	   Each of the estimated 10,000 torchbearers will run between 500
meters and one kilometer as the route covers about 270-kilometers
per day in 100 days and 1,000 towns.
	   The route, announced by games organizers Saturday, will also
visit some exotic places. It will be put on a plane 24 times to be
taken to remote areas in Australia's Outback, while Queensland
premier Peter Beattie said it would go underwater at the Great
Barrier Reef.
	   Beattie declined to say how it will be achieved without dousing
the famous flame.
	   It will also travel on the cross-country Indian-Pacific train, a
Melbourne tram, a camel in remote Western Australia, a surf
lifesaving boat and on the Flying Doctor service on a journey which
will showcase Australia to the world.
	   ``I personally would be delighted if we were able to engender
the enthusiasm and the emotion and the togetherness that it has
created in the past,'' said Australian International Olympic
Committee member Phil Coles.
	   ``It's a fundamental reason why it's been so successful, because
people as a whole go to it and embrace it.''
	   The torch lands in Australia on June 8, 2000 after being lit at
Olympia, Greece, early in May and then traveling through the
Oceania region.
	   It starts its Australian journey in the Outback, with Atlanta
Olympics field hockey gold medalist Peris-Kneebone setting out from
Uluru, or Ayers Rock _ the world's largest monolith.
	   Before the flame arrives in the Olympic Stadium for the Sept. 15
opening ceremony a wide range of Australians will have carried it.
	   ``It won't just be for the young and the fit _ the (1956)
Melbourne torch relay consisted entirely of young fit men all of
whom had to be able to run a mile in six minutes or less,'' Sydney
organizing committee president Michael Knight said Saturday.
	   ``It'll be very different this time, anyone from 12 years
upwards will be allowed to carry the torch. It'll include
grandparents, it'll include disabled people and, unlike the
Melbourne run, it'll include women as well.''

	   SUZUKA, Japan (AP) _ Michael Schumacher, trailing Mika Hakkinen
by four points for the Formula One championship, won the pole
position Saturday for the season-ending Japanese Grand Prix.
	   Sunday's race will decide whether Schumacher claims his third
season title or Hakkinen wins his first.
	   Schumacher's Ferrari will start from the pole, with Hakkinen
alongside in the front row. Hakkinen's McLaren teammate David
Coulthard earned the inside position of the second row with the
third fastest qualifying time Saturday.
	   Eddie Irvine will start in the second row's outside position.
	   Schumacher, who has to finish first or second in the finale to
overtake Hakkinen in the series standings, clocked a lap of 1
minute 36.293 seconds on the 5.864-kilometer (3.643-mile) Suzuka
Circuit, followed by Hakkinen's 1:36.471.
	   ``It's only qualifying today. So there's no reason for me to be
too much excited,'' said Schumacher. ``I'll just concentrate on the
race tomorrow.''
	   Hakkinen also downplayed the significance of the qualifying
results, saying ``I'll just see tomorrow what will happen.''
	   For Schumacher, being fastest on Sunday won't necessarily be
enough to capture the championship. He not only needs to finish
first but needs Hakkinen to do no better than third.
	   Hakkinen needs only a second-place finish to clinch the season
title.
	   Coulthard posted the third fastest time of 1:37.496, just ahead
of Irvine's 1:38.197.

Two major Japanese banks mulling alliance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with confirmation from both banks of possible tie-up.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two of Japan's largest banks said Saturday that
they may form a strategic alliance in a key business area to cope
with increased deregulation and spur bad loan write-offs.
	   Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and Fuji Bank Ltd., both among the top
ten largest banks in Japan, said that they have begun considering a
plan to merge their trust banking operations into a jointly owned
venture.
	   But in separate statements released Saturday, the two banks
denied any plans for a full-scale merger.
	   The proposed venture, unusual in that it would link major banks
from industrial groups with few traditional ties, would specialize
in asset-management, a business field recently deregulated under
Japan's ``Big Bang'' program of opening financial markets to
greater competition.
	   It comes as just the latest example of restructuring in Japan's
ailing banking sector, which has been hurt by massive bad loans and
a prolonged slump in the overall economy.
	   On Friday, Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. said it would close its
overseas banking operations and Sakura Bank Ltd., another core
company of the Mitsui group, said it would slash 3,000 jobs, or 20
percent of its work force within three years.
	   The link between Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Fuji Bank would
reportedly help strengthen troubled Fuji affiliate Yasuda Trust and
Banking Co. by providing an infusion of funds to the cash-strapped
lender.
	   Under the deal, Yasuda Trust would sell its pension-management
and securities-custody businesses to the new venture in return for
200 billion yen (dlrs 1.72 billion) in capital to write-off its
non-performing loans, the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported, citing
unnamed sources.
	   Yasuda would also transfer its overseas operations to the
venture, the report said.
	   Such a move would ease concern about the financial health of
Japan's Fuyo industrial group, which is headed by Fuji Bank and
includes Yasuda Trust, Nissan Motor Co. and trading house Marubeni
Corp.
	   Separately, Fuji Bank on Friday denied a report of plans to sell
its controlling stake in Heller Financial Inc., a U.S.
commercial-finance subsidiary, to generate cash for writing off its
own portfolio of bad loans.
	   Kyodo News agency reported the sale was planned as part of a
broader restructuring which would also halve the number of overseas
outlets operated by the bank.

Rubin says crisis not over despite G-7 agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to raise Rubin quote. EDITS to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN CRUTSINGER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Economics Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The world's largest industrial countries have
come up with their most detailed plan yet for coping with global
financial troubles. But U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin is not
ready to declare the crisis at an end.
	   ``It's going to take time for the world to work its way through
these problems,'' Rubin told reporters Friday. ``There are many
challenges ahead. I think there will be ups and downs.''
	   Private economists said that while many important details remain
to be worked out, they were encouraged by the joint statements
issued by the leaders and finance officials of the Group of Seven
wealthy nations _ the United States, Japan, Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada.
	   ``The critical point is that the G-7, which had for some time
appeared divided and fragmented, has now pulled together with a
strategic plan,'' said Robert Hormats, economist at Goldman Sachs
in New York.
	   The plan is likely to get an early test with announcement of an
expected dlrs 30 billion rescue package for Brazil, the latest
nation to be threatened by the flight of panicked foreign
investors.
	   A key portion of the new package would allow the International
Monetary Fund to supply emergency loans to a country before
currency and stock market meltdowns leveled its economy. President
Bill Clinton, who first suggested this change, praised the other
G-7 countries for supporting this proposal.
	   ``This line of credit gives us a powerful new tool that can be
used when it will do the most good at the lowest cost, before the
trouble starts,'' Clinton said.
	   He said the U.S. economy remains strong despite the global
turmoil, citing a report Friday that the economy grew at a healthy
annual rate of 3.3 percent from July to September. But he said
continued American prosperity depended on restoring growth in
developing countries.
	   ``If America's economy is to continue to grow, the economies of
our trading partners must continue to grow,'' Clinton said.
	   The administration produced both a joint statement from G-7
leaders and a declaration by G-7 finance ministers and central bank
presidents detailing the new action plan Friday.
	   As part of that plan, the G-7 leaders endorsed a new emergency
lending facility at the World Bank, the sister lending agency of
the IMF. The World Bank facility would be used to provide support
for poor people and loan guarantees for businesses that are
endangered by economic turbulence.
	   Wall Street and other markets rallied on the newfound resolve
among the G-7 countries. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the
day up 97 points, returning it to levels not seen for two months
and providing the biggest one-month gain in the blue-chip average
since 1987.
	   Brazilian share prices rallied strongly as well on growing
optimism about a rescue package. A team of Brazilian officials is
scheduled to meet soon with IMF officials.
	   Private economists said the G-7 statement unity was especially
welcome after the discord displayed in initial talks early this
month, at which the G-7 countries promised only to ``explore''
Clinton's proposals.
	   Since then, Congress has approved dlrs 18 billion to replenish
IMF resources, badly strained by more than dlrs 100 billion in
bailouts it has arranged over the past 15 months.
	   ``This is a belated attempt by the G-7 to support markets and
ease fears,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Primark Global
Economics.
	   But analysts said much work remains to implement vague pledges
to promote greater openness in the release of financial data and
stronger financial regulation.
	   The G-7 nations also pledged to work for change at the IMF,
which has been criticized for its handling of the Asian crisis.
Those steps, including less secrecy in dealings with member
countries and more efforts to promote free-market reforms, had been
conditions Congress attached to passage of the administration's IMF
request.
	   The action plan released Friday followed a string of other
favorable developments in recent weeks, including passage by the
Japanese parliament of a plan to deal with its insolvent banks and
interest rate cuts in the United States, Canada and several
European countries that have eased fears of a global recession.

Israeli warplanes attack guerrilla hideouts in South Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RASHAYA, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes attacked suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon in an overnight raid,
Lebanese security officials said Saturday.
	   The jets fired two air-to-surface missiles at Zillaya, a valley
12 kilometers (seven miles) southwest of Rashaya in the southern
Bekaa Valley.
	   There was no word on casualties from the attack which occurred
an hour after midnight Friday.
	   The officials said the raid came after guerrillas of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group attacked the Israeli
Ahmadiyeh outpost at the edge of an Israeli-occupied zone in South
Lebanon.
	   A Hezbollah statement said fighters used ``appropriate weapons''
in the attack against the post which is manned by the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia.
	   The attack triggered large-scale Israeli and SLA shelling of
suspected guerrilla hideouts and infiltration trails opposite the
enclave which continued till Saturday morning.
	   The security officials said at least 70 shells were fired on the
Zillaya valley as well as the village of Qilya in the Bekaa.
	   Hezbollah guerrillas are fighting to oust some 1,500 Israeli
troops and 2,500 SLA militiamen from the border zone which Israel
set up in 1985 to prevent cross-border attacks.

Report: Indonesian team expected to announce riot findings soon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A fact-finding team investigating
riots in Indonesia which killed about 1,200 people and helped end
the rule of former President Suharto in May was expected to release
its findings soon, a newspaper said Saturday.
	   The newspaper Kompas quoted team chairman Marzuki Darusman as
saying he would release a report into the causes of the violence
sometime after his investigators meet six cabinet ministers on
Monday.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, formed the
18-member fact-finding team in July. Its members include human
rights activists, senior police officers, lawyers, bureaucrats and
community leaders.
	   The finding was expected to address a number of sensitive
issues, including allegations of mass rapes of ethnic Chinese women
as well as reports that elements in the military instigated some of
the unrest.
	   Meanwhile, Indonesia's powerful military has said it will
maintain security and order next month when Indonesia's highest
legislative body, the People's Consultative Assembly, convenes.
	   About 30,000 troops and civilians are to be deployed in the
capital city of Jakarta.
	   The military ``is ready to secure the meeting from all attempts
to make it fail,'' armed forces commander Gen. Wiranto was quoted
by the official Antara news agency as saying.
	   The warning comes amid growing protests against Habibie's
administration.
	   On Wednesday 8,000 students marched on Parliament and demanded
his resignation. The crowd also called on the government to cancel
the meeting of the legislature, which many claim is stacked with
old Suharto supporters.
	   Critics complain the assembly will not come up with sweeping
democratic reforms which had been promised by Habibie.
	   ``The recent demonstrations were not just acts of freedom of
expression. It's becoming a kind of a show of force that tends to
be anarchic. It violates the law,'' Antara quoted Wiranto as
saying.

Dalai Lama's overture could spark opposition among Tibetans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHARMSALA, India (AP) _ Word that the Dalai Lama is planning an
overture to China worries some Tibetans in the hilly Indian city
where the spiritual leader runs a government-in-exile.
	   ``We are concerned about this,'' Peme Lhundup, general secretary
of the Tibetan Youth Congress, said Friday in Dharmsala.
	   The TYC rejects the Dalai's Lama call only for autonomy for
Tibet within China and the group is campaigning for full
independence from China.
	   Last year, its campaign included hunger strikes to publicize its
aims, despite the Dalai Lama's ruling that such tactics are against
his commitment to nonviolence.
	   Tsewang Tethong, a Dharmsala-based adviser to the Dalai Lama on
foreign affairs, confirmed Friday that the Dalai Lama had prepared
a statement he believed would open the way to talks with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin.
	   Though Tethong would not describe the document in detail, he
hinted it would address China's demands that the Dalai Lama
publicly state that both Tibet and Taiwan are part of China.
	   Tethong could not say when the statement, now being reviewed by
advisers, would be released, but other sources say this might come
when the Dalai Lama visits Washington on Nov. 7-10.
	   Tethong also could not say when talks with China might begin. He
said the Dalai Lama would like to meet Jiang at a Buddhist
pilgrimage site, Riu Tsenga, in China's Shanxi Province.
	   Yu Shuning, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington,
told The Associated Press on Thursday that his government will be
closely watching the Buddhist leader's visit to Washington and his
contacts with U.S. officials.
	   ``So long as the Dalai Lama stops all his activities aimed at
separating Tibet and China, then talks may be started between the
Chinese government and the Dalai Lama,'' Yu said. ``So we are going
to see what he has to say and what he will do.''
	   Tibetan sources say the secret dialogue started some three years
ago, but until now, the Tibetans have refused to concede to China's
conditions for talks.
	   ``There should be no preconditions'' to talks between the Dalai
Lama and the Chinese president, insisted Lhundup of the Tibetan
Youth Congress. ``They should meet on equal status, as heads of the
seat of government.''
	   The Dalai Lama fled his Himalayan homeland after a failed 1959
uprising against Chinese rule. Thousands of followers who see him
as both a spiritual and political leader came with him to India.

Dengue fever claims 321 lives in Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Dengue fever has killed 321 people in
Vietnam so far this year, nearly 50 percent more than the total for
all of 1997, a government official said Saturday.
	   Tran Hung of the Ministry of Health said 159,449 people had
contracted the disease as of Oct 20. The Southeast Asian country's
southern provinces account for 80 percent of the cases and 95
percent of the deaths, he added.
	   Of the 15,515 people who contracted the disease in the first 20
days of October, 24 died, he said.
	   The 12 Mekong Delta provinces were hit particularly hard by
dengue, he said, as swamps and water tanks prepared by farmers for
use during the five-month dry season starting in November attracted
mosquitoes that carry the disease.
	   Last year, 226 of the 107,000 people who contracted the virus
died.
	   Dengue infects an estimated 50 million people each year in a
geographic band around the equator. It causes fever, joint pains,
chills and, in serious cases, hemorrhaging. Patients can take
several weeks to recover.

Bazan holds WBC lightweight title in split decision
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cesar Bazan kept his WBC lightweight title
Friday night with a tough split-decision in Ciudad Juarez over a
dogged Mauro Lucero, who had dropped from the super lightweight
category for the fight.
	   Bazan stung Lucero several times in the early rounds, but the
challenger _ fighting before a hometown crowd _ held his ground as
the fight went on and often was the aggressor, squeezing in tight
to limit Bazan's greater reach.
	   But while Lucero landed punches, none seemed to stun the
champion and the two fighters spent much of the last six rounds
entwined, often wobbling into the ropes in a clumsy embrace.
	   Bazan, who won his title June 13 with a victory over Stevie
Johnson across the Rio Grande in El Paso, Texas, took the decision
116-112, 115-114, 115-115.
	   Bazan, making his second defense of the title, entered the fight
with a record of 33-2-1 with 23 knockouts. Lucero was 32-3-1 with
20 knockouts. Lucero is the WBC's 10th ranked super lightweight.

Israeli warplanes attack guerrilla hideouts in South Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RASHAYA, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes attacked suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon in an overnight raid,
Lebanese security officials said Saturday.
	   The jets fired two air-to-surface missiles at Zillaya, a valley
12 kilometers (seven miles) southwest of Rashaya in the southern
Bekaa Valley.
	   There was no word on casualties from the attack which occurred
an hour after midnight Friday.
	   The officials said the raid came after guerrillas of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group attacked the Israeli
Ahmadiyeh outpost at the edge of an Israeli-occupied zone in South
Lebanon.
	   A Hezbollah statement said fighters used ``appropriate weapons''
in the attack against the post which is manned by the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia.
	   The attack triggered large-scale Israeli and SLA shelling of
suspected guerrilla hideouts and infiltration trails opposite the
enclave which continued till Saturday morning.
	   The security officials said at least 70 shells were fired on the
Zillaya valley as well as the village of Qilya in the Bekaa.
	   Hezbollah guerrillas are fighting to oust some 1,500 Israeli
troops and 2,500 SLA militiamen from the border zone which Israel
set up in 1985 to prevent cross-border attacks.

Refugees return home but face hardship of rebuilding

 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL;

	   KISNA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ For months, they slept in a
makeshift camp in huts made of tree-branch frames and covered with
plastic sheeting, scared to return to their homes after Serb troops
overran their village.
	   Now most of the ethnic Albanian refugees who fled up Drenica
mountain have returned home, but their property is so badly damaged
they still fear the cold and hunger as a harsh winter approaches in
Kosovo.
	   ``We are going home, but we are taking these tents with us
because our house is such a disaster we will have to sleep in the
garden,'' Husa Goraj, 52, said Friday.
	   About 3,000 refugees lived in the camp after fleeing Serb forces
who took over Kisna Reka, 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of
Pristina, and other villages in the area during an offensive that
began in February.
	   Most returned to their homes in Kisna Reka on Thursday. But a
few like Goraj finished packing belongings Friday or planned to
stay longer because Serb police were still patrolling their
villages.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic sent troops in to battle ethnic
Albanian separatists. About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
inhabitants are ethnic Albanians, and most want independence from
Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   In Kisna Reka, a few miles (kilometers) down a dirt road from
the refugee camp, returning residents began rebuilding their
shelled and burned homes.
	   ``We tried to make a roof with plastic, but as soon as the wind
picks up it will blow away,'' said 20-year-old Hasim Suliqi,
pointing to a charred farm house missing its roof.
	   Suliqi said that on the previous night _ their first at home in
more than three months _ his 15 family members slept in one small
room. He also said the Serbs burned his family's wheat and corn
fields, and the garden was so neglected no crops could be saved.
	   ``We have no food and no money,'' Suliqi said. ``The winter will
be very difficult. I don't know if we will all survive.''
	   His 74-year-old father, Beqiv, said he didn't trust the Serb
withdrawal and had left the family's plastic tents at the camp in
case they needed to flee again.
	   International observers report large numbers of Serb police and
Yugoslav soldiers have returned to barracks or left Kosovo, as
agreed to under an Oct. 12 accord between Milosevic and U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke.
	   NATO threatened airstrikes if Milosevic did not keep his word.
The threat of airstrikes remains, though the military alliance this
week lifted its deadline for Milosevic to fully comply with the
wide-ranging agreement.
	   The sight of even a few remaining policemen and soldiers in some
areas has kept many refugees from returning home.
	   A spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency in Geneva, Kris
Janowski, said Friday it was hard to tell how many of the 300,000
refugees were back home. He estimated 20,000 homes had been
destroyed, and said some refugees found booby traps such as
grenades set with trip wires in doorways.
	   Another problem was well water contaminated by animal carcasses
thrown down the shaft by Serb forces, he said.
	   Inside the Suliqi walled compound, which houses three families
in traditional Albanian style, two men hammered branches to build a
shelter for belongings brought from the camp on a wagon. Another
group of men cleared bricks and weeds from the garden.
	   Several women washed clothes and dishes and tried to clean rooms
strewn with broken furniture, clothing and other belongings.
	   Despite the filth and damage, most refugees expressed relief at
finally being home.

 &UR; Penguins 2, Canucks 2 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In Vancouver, British Columbia, Alexander Mogilny's breakaway
goal 17 seconds into the third period completed Vancouver's
comeback from a 2-0 deficit and the Canucks tied the Pittsburgh
Penguins.
	   The Canucks, 0-2-1 in their last three games, came within a
video review of winning the game 2:13 into overtime when it was
ruled that Markus Naslund kicked the puck in the net after teammate
Brandon Convery shot off the inside of the right post.
	   A minute later, the Penguins had a chance to win but Canucks
goalie Garth Snow dove across the crease to make a spectacular pad
save on Martin Straka.
	   The Penguins, whose power-play unit accounted for both goals,
are 2-0-1 in their last three games and are 4-1-1 on the road this
season.
 &UR; Lightning 3, Kings 0
	   In Inglewood, California, Daymond Langkow snapped a scoreless
tie with his first goal of the season in the third period and Tampa
Bay scored two empty-net goals in the final 30 seconds for a
victory over the Los Angeles Kings.
	   Langkow's rebound sailed over the outstretched right arm of
rookie goalie Manny Legace, hit the right post and bounced in at
2:21 after the Kings had turned the puck over at the blue line.
	   Darcy Tucker and Cory Cross scored empty-net goals in the final
30 seconds. The Lightning dominated the third period, outshooting
the Kings 15-8.
	   Daren Puppa stopped 27 shots for his second shutout of the
season and helped the Lightning beat the Kings for the second time
in a week.

Support for Thai candidate as WTO chief gaining momentum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Support for Thailand's Deputy Prime
Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi to head the World Trade Organization
is gaining momentum, but more has to be done to convince Western
nations, a senior Thai economic advisor said Saturday.
	   Supachai, who also serves as the Southeast Asian nation's
commerce minister, is currently on a trip to Japan, United States,
Europe and Latin America to gather support for his bid for the
director-generalship of the WTO, a Geneva-based global trade
watchdog.
	   ``We are gaining strong momentum in Asia, although more has to
be done to convince Western nations. The support from Japan is very
encouraging and has given Thailand a big boost,'' said Arporn
Chewakreng, an advisor to Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai.
	   ``Dr. Supachai has great understanding of the problems and needs
of developing countries,'' Arporn said.
	   Arporn also said he doesn't think a trade dispute between
Thailand and the U.S. over intellectual property protection issues
will derail Supachai's candidacy.
	   The Thai deputy premier and U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky were scheduled to meet in Washington on Tuesday.
	   Thailand is one of 32 countries on a U.S. ``watch list'' because
it does not, according to Washington, properly safeguard
intellectual property rights.
	   Prior to his departure Thursday, Supachai told the Foreign
Correspondents Club of Thailand that he still could not assess his
chances of attaining the WTO post.
	   Other candidates include former New Zealand Prime Minister
Michael Moore, former Canadian Trade Minister Roy MacLaren and
former Moroccan Trade Minister Hassan Aboyoub.
	   The term of the current director-general, Renato Ruggiero, ends
next April.

Tiananmen Square closed for repairs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Tiananmen Square, the vast plaza that was the
site of massive 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations, will be closed
for repairs ahead of next year's 50th anniversary of the founding
of Communist China.
	   During the seven-month facelift, the cement paving of the square
will be replaced by granite and lighting systems and fountains will
be improved, the state-run newspaper People's Daily reported
Saturday.
	   It said that although the area would be closed, visitors could
still view the popular daily flag-raising ceremony from across
Changan Avenue, the boulevard that borders the northern edge of the
square.
	   The project is to be finished by the end of next May, the report
said.
	   Tiananmen Square is at the heart of downtown Beijing, bordered
by ancient imperial palaces, the national legislature and other
landmarks. From Tiananmen Gate, to the north, revolutionary leader
Mao Tse-tung proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of
China on Oct. 1, 1949.
	   Periodically, Beijing's residents have gathered in the square in
celebration or in protest, as in 1989, when student-led
demonstrators camped in the plaza for weeks demanding democratic
political reforms.
	   On June 3-4, soldiers backed by tanks and armored personnel
carriers marched in from Beijing's outskirts, firing on crowds as
they headed for the square in the city's heart. Hundreds, some say
thousands, were killed. The protest were vanquished, and police
surveillance and control of activities in the square have since
remained tight.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ Tropical Storm Mitch sloshed into the
heart of Honduras on Saturday, spreading death and destruction
throughout the impoverished country already stunned by the storm's
ravaging of the Atlantic seaboard.
	   At least 127 were confirmed dead in the region. Hundreds of
thousands had fled or lost their homes. And the U.S. Coast Guard
said it had not yet found a tourist schooner with 31 people that
had reported being rocked by then-Hurricane Mitch on Tuesday.
	   After blasting the Atlantic Coast for three days, Mitch pushed
into the center of Honduras to the capital of Tegucigalpa, adding
to catastrophic flooding throughout the country of 6 million
people, as well as in neighboring Nicaragua.
	   ``Almost everything is damaged or destroyed and it will be
difficult to recover from such a tragedy,'' said Col. Anael Perez,
spokesman for the Permanent Emergency Commission.
	   With rainfall of 4 inches (10 cms) an hour at the height of the
storm, downed bridges, rampant rivers, toppled trees and mudslides
had isolated hundreds of communities where food, water and medicine
were in short supply.
	   The U.S. National Hurricane Center said that at 0600 GMT
Saturday, the storm was centered about 15 miles (25 kms) southeast
of Tegucigalpa. It was heading southwest at 7 mph (11 kph).
	   Maximum sustained winds were near 50 mph (85 kph), down from 180
mph (290 kph) early Tuesday.
	   The strongest gusts were still hitting the north coast,
hampering efforts to bring relief and to search for a 258-foot
(77-meter) schooner, the Fantome, missing since Tuesday.
	   ``There's still not a lot we can do with the way the weather is
down there,'' said Jeff Hall, spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard.
	   The Antigua-registered Fantome, once owned by Aristotle Onassis,
is operated out of Miami by Windjammer Barefoot Cruises.
	   After dropping its tourist passengers off in Belize Monday
morning, the crew headed toward Roatan Island, off the north coast,
to escape the hurricane _ which for two days was centered near that
island.
	   ``We believe the vessel is out there and it's just a matter of
damage to the communication system that's preventing communication
with the crew,'' said Windjammer spokesman James Canty.
	   In their last communication, the crew of the Fantome said they
were experiencing 100-knot winds and 40-degree rolls, Canty said.
	   The presidents of Honduras and Nicaragua declared states of
emergency Friday. Honduras reported 56 known dead and Nicaragua 70,
but there was no communication with much of Honduras' countryside.
Mexico reported one death from Mitch on Monday.
	   Residents of Tegucigalpa formed long lines under a pelting rain
outside shops and gas stations Friday. Many stores ran out of
bottled water, milk, beans and rice. Gasoline stations limited the
number of liters sold to customers.
	   The rising Rio Grande that cuts through this city of 800,000
invaded houses, washed over roads and threatened to tear down the
four bridges across it. Officials banned vehicles on some bridges
and allowed only one car at a time to pass on others.
	   The capital's airport was closed.
	   Mayor Cesar Castellanos said more than 30,000 people had been
evacuated. An equal number had already been taken to shelters in
the nation's second city, San Pedro Sula in the north.
	   In Chamelecon, just south of San Pedro Sula, people walked
through waist-deep water to load televisions and refrigerators onto
trucks as they moved into shelters.
	   Two thousand people slept on bits of cardboard amid dogs and
chickens at a gymnasium. There was little to eat and only rainwater
to drink.
	   ``They've given us very little food _ just a little bread,
nothing more. I have no money and can't get in touch with my other
relatives,'' said Estela Munoz, 49.
	   Honduran Foreign Minister Fernando Martinez said the United
States and Taiwan each had donated dlrs 500,000. But local business
leaders told Honduran television that economic losses could reach
the billions of dollars.

Singapore unions accept cut in pension contributions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's unions accepted a proposal on
Saturday which calls for cuts in employers' pension contributions
and allows the government to implement whatever steps it finds
necessary to cope with an economic downturn.
	   The government was expected to recommend sharp wage cuts and
other retrenchment steps in an economic package to be presented
early next month which was crafted to encourage foreign businesses
to stay in Singapore.
	   Singaporeans have been spared the worst effects of the regional
financial crisis which broke out last year, but increasingly fear
has spread that higher wages and business costs have led companies
to abandon Singapore in favor of cheaper neighboring states.
	   Singapore's unions are tied closely to the government and
management in the small city-state, where labor strikes are unheard
of. The head of the National Trades Union Congress, which completed
its three-day delegates conference on Saturday, is a member of the
Cabinet.
	   ``The union delegates accepted the proposed 10 per cent cut in
employers' (Central Provident Fund) contribution as part of the
overall cuts in wage and non-wage costs so that we can regain our
competitiveness,'' the union conference said in a closing
statement.
	   Delegates also adopted a resolution ``pledging labor's full
support to the government in adopting whatever measures necessary
to counteract the effects of the sharp economic downturn.''
	   The delegates expressed confidence that the government would in
some way cushion the cuts in wages and pension contributions, which
many Singaporeans use to make their mortgage payments.

 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. UPDATES with defending champion uncertain about
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Not often will a defending champion say he
doesn't think he can repeat. John Kagwe is an exception.
	   Only Kagwe's reasoning is different. He's not downgrading his
chances in Sunday's New York City Marathon, he's just being wary
and respectful of his opponents.
	   ``No, I'm not confident about defending the title,'' the Kenyan
said. ``But everybody has expectations, everybody comes here
expecting to win. So I can't say that I will win.''
	   Kagwe was not favored to win last year, but off his previous
marathon races, in which he had shown steady improvement, he was
considered among the top contenders.
	   He first ran the New York City Marathon in 1995 and finished
fifth in 2 hours, 11 minutes, 42 seconds. He came back in 1996 and
placed fourth in 2:10:59. Last year, he not only won, but also
dropped his time to a career-best 2:08:12, the second fastest in
the race's 28-year history.
	   Had he not stopped to tie his shoelaces twice and run the final
three miles (4.8 kilometers) with his laces loose, he probably
would have broken the course record of 2:08:01 set by Ethiopia's
Juma Ikangaa in 1989.
	   Kagwe was running in a new pair of shoes last year. On Sunday,
``I will wear old shoes,'' he said, laughing.
	   Even with worn shoes, Kagwe might not run as fast as last year.
In races leading up to New York, he has not done as well as in
1997. For example, last year, he was runner-up in the Philadelphia
Distance Run Half-Marathon; this year, he was eighth.
	   Kagwe dismisses those results, saying that last year he trained
harder for the shorter races than the marathon, whereas this year
he has concentrated more on winning New York again.
	   To repeat as champion, Kagwe probably will have to run fast
again on the difficult, hilly New York course because the men's
field is very strong. It includes 1997 runner-up Joseph Chebet of
Kenya, 1996 Olympic gold medalist Josia Thugwane of South Africa,
two-time champion German Silva of Mexico, 1997 world champion Abel
Anton of Spain and first-time marathoner Peter Githuka of Kenya,
Kagwe's training partner in Norristown, Pa.
	   Kagwe's doesn't expect to run as fast as the world record of
2:06:05 set recently by Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa because New York
doesn't lend itself to such times. But he said a time in the 2:07
range is possible.
	   ``But it's hard on the hills near the end,'' he said.
	   Kagwe also said being the defending champion is playing on his
mind.
	   ``I feel a lot of pressure to defend,'' he said. ``It's not a
matter of how fast to go, it's a matter of tactics.
	   ``I've never had to defend a title. I'm trying to cope with
this.''
	   Last year, Kagwe made his big move with four miles remaining.
There, he pulled away from Chebet and won by 1:15, despite his
shoelaces flapping against his legs. He was fortunate he did not
trip and fall.
	   The old shoes should solve that problem this time. But will they
be fast enough?

Russian lawmakers take aid to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian lawmakers with ultranationalist Vladimir
Zhirinovsky's party took a shipment of humanitarian aid to Iraq on
Saturday, a news report said.
	   Mikhail Gutseriyev, deputy speaker of the lower house of
Russia's parliament, led the delegation, which was also expected to
visit Iran for talks on economic cooperation, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Zhirinovsky said Thursday that he would also make the trip. It
was unclear why he changed his plans.
	   He had said the cargo would include medicine and school
stationery for Iraq, which remains under U.N. sanctions.
	   Zhirinovsky went to Baghdad in February and offered to stay as a
``human shield'' against potential U.S. attacks, an offer that was
apparently spurned.

Many Kosovo Albanians seek safety in Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Back Home &QL; 
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Newly wed and newly widowed, Kajtaz Thaci stares
vacantly through a haze of cigarette smoke, struggling to come to
terms with the fact that he's finally safe _ but alone in
Switzerland.
	   The ethnic Albanian farmer, who says his 21-year-old wife
Mukadeze was killed in a Serb attack just a week after their
marriage, sought refuge in this peaceful Alpine nation after
fleeing the violence in Kosovo.
	   Thaci, 22, is one of an estimated 5,000 Kosovo Albanian refugees
who arrived here this month. Already hosting a 150,000-member
ethnic Albanian population, Switzerland has become an unwilling
magnet for the refugees.
	   Although asylum is difficult to obtain _ only 5 percent of
Kosovo Albanian applicants succeed each year _ the Swiss government
allows in refugees who already have family in Switzerland and is
letting many others stay until the situation improves in the
troubled province.
	   The army is providing emergency shelter, food and medical care
to help overwhelmed civilian authorities handle the new arrivals.
In Geneva and Basel, underground nuclear bunkers have become
temporary accommodation for the refugees.
	   Germany is believed to have the biggest Kosovo Albanian
population in Europe, followed by the Swiss.
	   About 22,000 Yugoslavs _ the vast majority Kosovo Albanians _
have arrived in Germany this year seeking asylum. Other countries
including Italy are also registering much smaller, but rising,
numbers.
	   Officials at Geneva's Popular Albanian University, a shabby
building formerly occupied by a computer business opposite the
city's soccer stadium, say they deal with at least 50 to 60 new
arrivals from Kosovo each day, compared with 10 to 20 three months
ago.
	   Sitting in the university's smoky canteen while awaiting
registration at the city's asylum office, Thaci says he became
separated from his family after his wife's death in the Serb attack
two months ago. He survived in the forest before catching a boat
from Albania to Italy and traveling to Switzerland, where he has an
uncle.
	   Thaci glossed over details of his journey. But many refugees pay
large cash sums to organized gangs to smuggle them in.
	   Across the canteen, Nadire Pashtriku, 33, her husband Agni, 34,
and their four children were eating lunch.
	   The family say they fled Prizren in southern Kosovo, after Serb
police began to suspect Agni, a grocer, was supplying food to the
Kosovo Liberation Army, the guerrilla force fighting for
independence for the province. ``We were very worried about the
children,'' said Nadire. ``It was a difficult decision to take but
it was the only solution.''
	   Created in 1996, the university acts as a community center
offering basic education and training to young Albanians. It also
increasingly supports Kosovo refugees struggling with Swiss asylum
procedures.
	   The Swiss government makes all Kosovo Albanians apply for asylum
and has refused blanket approval to Kosovo Albanians to stay until
the conflict ends, as it did with Bosnians fleeing their earlier
civil war.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates so far this
year there have been 53,000 asylum requests from Yugoslav nationals
in western European nations _ the overwhelming majority from Kosovo
Albanians.
	   ``These countries, not only Switzerland but Germany and others,
must show solidarity with these people,'' said university social
worker Naim Malaj.

China appoints judges to combat corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The Supreme Court has appointed 10 judges to
supervise efforts to curb widespread corruption within China's
judicial system, official reports said Saturday.
	   The judges, appointed Friday, will be responsible for providing
advice on difficult or controversial court cases and will
investigate allegations of corruption, the China Daily and other
newspapers reported.
	   The reports underline the extent to which corruption has
permeated the court system at all levels.
	   Xiao Yang, president of the Supreme People's Court, cautioned
that the supervisory judges should guard against accepting gifts
and attending banquets.
	   ``It is very important that the superintendents themselves abide
by the relevant rules and regulations,'' the reports quoted Jiang
Fukang, director of the Supreme People's Court's Supervision
Office, as saying.

China to ease restrictions on Taiwan business executives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ To further encourage investment in the Chinese
mainland, the government plans to relax controls on visits by
businessmen from Taiwan, the official newspaper China Daily
reported Saturday.
	   Visitors from Taiwan who have had major investments in China for
more than five years and whose companies have performed well will
have travel documents stamped with a permit allowing unlimited
entries, it said.
	   The looser controls would allow such business owners to live in
China for up to five years, it said.
	   Technical and managerial staff of such enterprises from Taiwan
and their families could stay in China for up to three years,
compared with the current limit of two years, the report added.
	   The report did not provide further details.
	   China and Taiwan have been politically estranged since the
Nationalists fled the mainland after losing a civil war to the
communists in 1949. But the Chinese government has actively
encouraged investment by Taiwan businesses.

Yeltsin retreats, appears ready to relinquish some powers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin looks set to begin the winter in
hibernation, and his aides are preparing the country for a
scaled-back presidency when the Russian leader returns to public
life.
	   With his health faltering yet again, Yeltsin's shrinking role
has become clear in recent weeks. He is apparently ready to limit
his duties, while resisting calls for his resignation.
	   No formal changes have been announced, but there seems little
doubt that a major political shift is taking place in Russia.
Yeltsin has dominated political life throughout the 1990s with his
forceful personality and a friendly constitution that concentrates
enormous power in his hands.
	   But since firing the entire Cabinet in August, Yeltsin has all
but ignored the country's pressing economic crisis and has handed
over most leadership roles to the new prime minister, Yevgeny
Primakov.
	   ``The president ... will not control everything, including
everyday economic questions,'' Oleg Sysuyev, Yeltsin's deputy chief
of staff, said this week.
	   Sysuyev gave several interviews this week sketching out lesser
roles Yeltsin might play when he recovers from his latest illness,
described as fatigue and high blood pressure. Yeltsin on Friday
headed to the Black Sea resort of Sochi for a two-week vacation.
	   When Yeltsin was more robust, Sysuyev's musings about the
president's future would have earned him instant banishment from
the Kremlin. Now, his comments seem part of an orchestrated effort
to prepare the country for the new, if still undefined role that
Yeltsin will assume.
	   Russians have not only accepted this change, but seem to welcome
it.
	   Primakov, a former spymaster and foreign minister, is
well-respected by all political factions, and has sought to build
consensus in dealing with the country's economic crisis. His
low-key style is in complete contrast to the bombastic Yeltsin, who
relishes confrontation with his rivals.
	   ``Yeltsin's absence is not destabilizing the country because his
disappearance has already become accepted by the Russian people,''
said Nikolai Petrov, a political analyst at the Carnegie Moscow
Center.
	   Primakov's government has moved at a plodding pace _ it's taken
two months just to put together an economic blueprint addressing
the economic morass.
	   Yet a recent nationwide poll gave Primakov a 50 percent approval
rating, while only 5 percent said Yeltsin was doing a good job.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has stormed back from previous ailments to
demonstrate that he was fully in charge. But this time there's a
widespread belief that he won't be able to reclaim the power he
once wielded, even if he wants to.
	   Today, the debate centers on whether it would be better for
Yeltsin to remain in office, even in a largely ceremonial role, or
if he should resign, and risk plunging the country into a political
crisis on top of its economic turmoil.
	   Primakov's government has not fixed any major problems, but
Russia has calmed down a bit since the early days of the crisis in
August.
	   The Russian ruble no longer resembles a yo-yo, having settled in
at around 16 to the dollar. Prices, while high, are no longer
rising by the day. A brief bout of panic has passed and store
shelves are well stocked. A one-day nationwide strike came and went
without incident at the beginning of October.
	   Yeltsin's critics in parliament want to push him out, but
impeachment is a long-shot at best. The president's term runs until
the middle of 2000, and if he steps down before then, Primakov
would become president and be required to call new elections within
three months.
	   An informal campaign has already begun, led by Moscow Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov, Siberian governor Alexander Lebed, Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov and liberal lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky. They span
the political spectrum and share only one trait _ all have
distanced themselves from Yeltsin.

Afghan opposition to release 100 more Taliban prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The opposition northern alliance will
release another 100 Taliban prisoners Saturday in a goodwill
gesture as the two warring sides observed a week-long cease-fire,
an opposition spokesman said.
	   ``We have brought 100 more Taliban prisoners to the front-line
and they will be released sometime today,'' said opposition
spokesman Arif, who uses only one name.
	   The hard-line Taliban militia and the opposition alliance agreed
to a week-long truce last week to initiate peace talks brokered by
Said Jalal, a close confidant of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince
Abdullah.
	   A Taliban spokesman Abdul Hai Muttmayan said Thursday that both
the sides have agreed to release 2,000 prisoners in a phased
exchange ``very soon''.
	   Arif said opposition forces released 50 Taliban prisoners last
week.
	   ``But we are still waiting for the release of our prisoners by
Taliban,'' he said.
	   He said the prisoner exchange is the result of efforts by Jalal,
who held meetings with the leaders of the two sides.
	   The truce and prisoner exchange has followed months of intense
fighting between the Taliban and the opposition alliance mostly in
the northern parts of the country.
	   The Taliban, or the students of Islam rule almost 90 percent of
Afghanistan including the capital, Kabul.
	   Earlier this month, opposition forces led by Ahmed Shah
Massood's Jamiat-e-Islami launched a counter offensive and
recaptured Taloqan _ the capital of northern Takhar province.
	   Massood was a defense minister in the ousted government of
Burhanuddin Rabbani. His Jamiat is the only opposition faction
providing heavy resistance to the Taliban.
	   The Taliban are Sunni Muslim and belong mostly to the majority
Pashtun ethnic group. They follow a strict version of Islam that
bars women from work and education, bans all sorts of light
entertainment including music and forces men to wear beards.
	   The opposition alliance comprise of religious and ethnic
minorities including Shiites, Hazaras, Tajiks and Uzbeks.

Fearing vigilante attacks, Indonesian police protect potential
</HEADLINE>
victims

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police have rounded up 131 people,
many of them mentally ill, to protect them from vigilantes seeking
revenge for mysterious killings, the official Antara news agency
reported Saturday.
	   Meanwhile, President B.J. Habibie repeated a pledge to end a
cycle of violence that began at the eastern end of Java but has
spread to other parts of Indonesia's main island. As many as 160
people have died.
	   The terror erupted several months ago with the serial murders of
suspected practitioners of black magic as well as Muslim clerics,
allegedly by assassins dressed in ninja-style black clothing.
	   Mobs in dozens of towns set up checkpoints and have lynched
people suspected of carrying out the murders. In many areas,
mentally ill people have become scapegoats.
	   Antara quoted police spokesman Lt. Col. Sutrisno as saying that
authorities in eastern Java are sheltering 131 people, 92 of them
mentally ill, in police stations. In some cases, mobs have tried to
seize suspects from police custody.
	   Muslim leaders have warned they will deploy their own security
forces if the military is unable to restore order, and Habibie has
offered them assurances that he is trying to solve the problem.
	   In a separate development, two assailants killed 40-year-old M.
Yusuf Abdullah, a civilian who used to work for the military in
Aceh province in northern Sumatra island, Antara reported.
	   Police suspect it was a revenge attack because resentment toward
the armed forces is deeply entrenched in Aceh, where the military
waged a campaign against separatist rebels over the past decade.
	   Human rights groups in Aceh have accused the military of
widespread abuses, including murder, torture and systematic rape.
Mass graves of alleged victims of the military have been uncovered.
	   The military has apologized for any wrongdoing and has withdrawn
some troops from the province.
	   There were no arrests in the killing of Abdullah, who was
stabbed in a coffee shop. Another former civilian agent for the
military was killed two weeks ago.

Tourists thrilled to ride behind classic steam engine

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ With a coal-flavored cloud rising from
its smoke stack and three short toots and then one long squeal from
its shrill whistle, the oldest working steam locomotive in the
world chugged out of a New Delhi station Saturday on its first
tourist run.
	   The 143-year-old Fairy Queen, newly painted shiny black and even
shinier green, evoked the days when most people never went
anywhere, when travel was an adventure, something out of the
ordinary. The Fairy Queen pulling a modern passenger car and a
pantry car headed from one of New Delhi's smaller stations on a
six-hour journey _ three times as long as a diesel engine would
take _ south to Alwar.
	   The 40 passengers, most Indian journalists and tourism
officials, were to spend the night at Alwar and take a tiger safari
in a nearby game park before heading back the next afternoon. The
round-trip train ride, game park visit and a night at an old palace
refurbished into a hotel was sold as a package for 8,000 rupees
(about dlrs 190.) Two trips a month are planned through February.
	   Rajesh Agrawal, director of India's National Rail Museum where
the Fairy Queen has been parked since 1971, said volunteers spent
the last year getting it back into running order. The engine was
built in Leeds, England by Kitson, Thompson and Hewitson and
started with Indian railways in 1855.
	   D. Mansingh, the Fairy Queen's fireman, proudly wore a black
suit as he shoveled coal, not yet sweating despite the heat in the
small space between the engine's oven of a mouth and its 20-ton
load of coal. Mansingh said he worked on steam engines for 13 years
before switching to diesel, and knew how much coal to add.
	   ``Steam engines are tricky, you have to work hard to maintain
the steam,'' Mansingh said, adding that the crew would be changed
every two hours.
	   German tourist Ingrid Bauer said she looked forward to watching
the scenery pass by slowly, a refreshing change from the speed and
efficiency of present-day travel.
	   ``The modern stuff is always the same, without character,'' said
Bauer, who was on her first trip to India.
	   Tourism and railway officials who have been advertising the
Fairy Queen through travel agents around the world and a web site
hope to tap that yearning for the romantic and the nostalgic.
According to India's International Tourism Bureau, the country gets
only 1 percent of the world's vacation traffic.
	   Poor roads, scarce hotels that meet international standards and
other infrastructure problems may account for the low number of
foreign tourists. But that hasn't deterred Allan Gray, a
68-year-old retired British electrical engineer and self-described
``steam enthusiast'' who made the Fairy Queen ride the ``grand
finale'' of his 10th trip to India.
	   ``In Europe, everything is clean and fast. You must clear your
mind of these Western expectations,'' he added before breaking away
to inspect the gleaming engine.

McGwire named Player of the Year by peers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE SCHNEIDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Florida (AP) _ Mark McGwire kept it short and
simple, just like his home run swing.
	   ``This is for you all,'' the St. Louis Cardinals slugger said to
his fellow players Friday night during the Players Choice Awards
ceremony. ``We put baseball back on the map and we should all be
proud of that.''
	   McGwire, who broke Roger Maris' record and went on to hit 70
home runs, was chosen Player of the Year by his peers and presented
the Players Choice Award.
	   His rival for the home run record, Sammy Sosa of the Chicago
Cubs, was honored as the outstanding player in the National League.
Sosa hit 66 homers, also breaking Maris' record of 61 set in 1961.
	   ``We both had unbelievable years,'' McGwire said during a news
conference with Sosa before the black-tie ceremony. ``No one in the
game of baseball has done what he and I did.''
	   Added Sosa: ``I always say that he was the man and he motivated
me. We had no jealousy.''
	   In presenting McGwire with the award, home run king Henry Aaron
praised the the St. Louis first baseman and Sosa for generating
renewed interest in major league baseball.
	   ``What they did for baseball is put it back on page one,'' the
Hall of Famer said. ``To have these two young men chase this record
that none of us thought would be broken was just the greatest thing
in sports.''
	   One question the players avoided was about a report in The
Toronto Globe and Mail that baseball plans to ban the use of
androstenedione, a muscle-enhancing supplement used by McGwire.
	   ``It's simple. I've already made my comment on that. That's all
I have to say,'' McGwire said.
	   Eight other awards were presented during the ceremony, which was
televised live from Walt Disney World. The awards are sponsored by
the Major League Baseball Player's Association.
	   Paul Molitor of the Minnesota Twins was voted major league
baseball's Man of the Year for his leadership on and off the field.
	   Oakland's Ben Grieve was selected the American League
Outstanding Rookie, Seattle's Alex Rodriguez the AL Outstanding
Player, and Baltimore's Eric Davis the AL Comeback Player.
Toronto's Roger Clemens and Boston's Pedro Martinez tied for AL
Outstanding Pitcher.
	   In the National League, pitcher Kerry Wood of the Cubs was voted
Outstanding Rookie, Atlanta's Greg Maddux was selected Outstanding
Pitcher, and San Diego's Greg Vaughn was honored as the Comeback
Player.

King Sihanouk celebrates birthday amid pleas for food
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk celebrated his
76th birthday Saturday at his Royal Palace, while on a nearby
sidewalk hungry farmers pleaded for his help.
	   ``I pray for our king to live a long life, so he can remain as
our cool shade for a long time,'' said 55-year-old Sam Sokhom from
the central province of Kandal, among the more than 100 villagers
gathered by the palace to ask for rice.
	   ``But I don't have any more rice left from last year's harvest
and I am asking his majesty to help us,'' she said.
	   Cars bringing flowers also arrived at the palace gate. And
birthday congratulations from government leaders were broadcast on
television and radio stations.
	   Thousands of poor farmers have been converging on the capital in
recent days to seek assistance from Sihanouk, who has long been
popular among Cambodia's rural dwellers.
	   Last year's harvest was poor. The farmers are predicting even
harder times because monsoon rains arrived late this year and
insects and rats have destroyed their seedlings.
	   ``We are still two months away from the harvest, but there is
nothing to eat at home already. Next year will be worse. We need
the king's help,'' said Meas Khem, 74.
	   State-controlled television has been showing Sihanouk giving
food and clothes to thousands of villagers at his palace. But the
constitutional monarch has said he cannot solve the problem by
himself.
	   He has expressed dismay over the country's political and
economic woes caused by ongoing bickering among major political
parties.
	   Sihanouk has held center stage in Cambodia for more than half a
century, surviving a military coup in 1970 and house arrest under
the murderous Khmer Rouge.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Tropical Storm Mitch sloshed into
the heart of Honduras on Saturday, spreading death and destruction
throughout the impoverished country already stunned by the storm's
ravaging of the Atlantic seaboard.
	   At least 127 were confirmed dead in the region. Hundreds of
thousands had fled or lost their homes. And the U.S. Coast Guard
said it had not yet found a tourist schooner with 31 people that
had reported being rocked by then-Hurricane Mitch on Tuesday.
	   After blasting the Atlantic Coast for three days, Mitch pushed
into the center of Honduras to the capital of Tegucigalpa, adding
to catastrophic flooding throughout the country of 6 million
people, as well as in neighboring Nicaragua.
	   ``Almost everything is damaged or destroyed and it will be
difficult to recover from such a tragedy,'' said Col. Anael Perez,
spokesman for the Permanent Emergency Commission.
	   With rainfall of 4 inches (10 cms) an hour at the height of the
storm, downed bridges, rampant rivers, toppled trees and mudslides
had isolated hundreds of communities where food, water and medicine
were in short supply.
	   The U.S. National Hurricane Center said that at 0600 GMT
Saturday, the storm was centered about 15 miles (25 kms) northeast
of Tegucigalpa. It was heading southwest at 7 mph (11 kph).
	   Maximum sustained winds were near 50 mph (85 kph), down from 180
mph (290 kph) early Tuesday.
	   The strongest gusts were still hitting the north coast,
hampering efforts to bring relief and to search for a 258-foot
(77-meter) schooner, the Fantome, missing since Tuesday.
	   ``There's still not a lot we can do with the way the weather is
down there,'' said Jeff Hall, spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard.
	   The Antigua-registered Fantome, once owned by Aristotle Onassis,
is operated out of Miami by Windjammer Barefoot Cruises.
	   After dropping its tourist passengers off in Belize Monday
morning, the crew headed toward Roatan Island, off the north coast,
to escape the hurricane _ which for two days was centered near that
island.
	   ``We believe the vessel is out there and it's just a matter of
damage to the communication system that's preventing communication
with the crew,'' said Windjammer spokesman James Canty.
	   In their last communication, the crew of the Fantome said they
were experiencing 100-knot winds and 40-degree rolls, Canty said.
	   The presidents of Honduras and Nicaragua declared states of
emergency Friday. Honduras reported 56 known dead and Nicaragua 70,
but there was no communication with much of Honduras' countryside.
Mexico reported one death from Mitch on Monday.
	   Residents of Tegucigalpa formed long lines under a pelting rain
outside shops and gas stations Friday. Many stores ran out of
bottled water, milk, beans and rice. Gasoline stations limited the
number of liters sold to customers.
	   The rising Rio Grande that cuts through this city of 800,000
invaded houses, washed over roads and threatened to tear down the
four bridges across it. Officials banned vehicles on some bridges
and allowed only one car at a time to pass on others.
	   The capital's airport was closed.
	   Mayor Cesar Castellanos said more than 30,000 people had been
evacuated. An equal number had already been taken to shelters in
the nation's second city, San Pedro Sula in the north.
	   In Chamelecon, just south of San Pedro Sula, people walked
through waist-deep water to load televisions and refrigerators onto
trucks as they moved into shelters.
	   Two thousand people slept on bits of cardboard amid dogs and
chickens at a gymnasium. There was little to eat and only rainwater
to drink.
	   ``They've given us very little food _ just a little bread,
nothing more. I have no money and can't get in touch with my other
relatives,'' said Estela Munoz, 49.
	   Honduran Foreign Minister Fernando Martinez said the United
States and Taiwan each had donated dlrs 500,000. But local business
leaders told Honduran television that economic losses could reach
the billions of dollars.

Russia's Cabinet meets to debate anti-crisis plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov convened his
government Saturday in a special session to finalize Russia's first
comprehensive plan for healing its troubled economy.
	   The Cabinet ministers were also expected to discuss a rehaul of
the banking sector, which has crumbled since the ruble was devalued
and Russia froze some of its debts on Aug. 17.
	   The government, named after Yeltsin fired its predecessor in the
fallout of those events, has been criticized for dragging its feet
on a blueprint for solving the crisis.
	   The International Monetary Fund has demanded to see an
anti-crisis plan and signs it is being implemented before resuming
frozen aid payments. The government presented a draft plan to the
IMF on Wednesday.
	   The IMF said Friday the two sides made progress in talks, but
the government hadn't yet made up its mind on key issues such as
its budget for 1999.
	   Versions of the plan released this week included measures to
stabilize the financial system and prop up the ruble. It would
streamline the budget system, restore production and improve tax
collection.
	   Primakov has said the government would approve the plan
Saturday, though it was unclear how effective it would be or how
many of the measures would be carried out.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said Friday that Russia
had come to ``mutually acceptable'' terms with holders of the
country's defaulted treasury debt. The two sides have been meeting
in London.
	   If the two sides don't reach a deal before Nov. 17, when
Russia's three-month debt moratorium is lifted, foreign banks will
likely launch a rash of lawsuits to freeze the accounts of Russian
banks abroad.
	   Also Friday, Russian government officials began a second round
of talks with a U.S. government delegation to discuss the
possibility of U.S. food aid to Russia this winter.

Police release one of U.S. servicemen in hit-and-run on Okinawa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A U.S. Air Force staff sergeant who had been a
suspect in a hit-and-run on Okinawa has been released, but a Marine
corporal remains in custody, Japanese police said Saturday.
	   The 22-year-old U.S. Marine is suspected of hitting a man on a
moped and fleeing the scene Friday in Naha, the capital of Okinawa.
The man suffered a bruised hand but no serious injuries.
	   Okinawa police spokesman Hiroshi Oyagawa said one of the
suspects was released late Friday because he was not the driver.
The two were arrested in Naha by Japanese police on Friday.
	   The accident is extremely sensitive because another Marine has
been charged with drunken driving and hit-and-run in a separate
fatal accident earlier this month.
	   The trial for Marine Cpl. Randall M. Eskridge, 23, of LaPorte,
Indiana, has been set for Nov. 18.
	   Many Okinawans harbor hard feelings toward the heavy U.S.
military presence on the southern island, about 1,600 kilometers
(1,000 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   Three-quarters of the American troops in Japan are stationed on
Okinawa. Crime is an especially touchy issue.
	   The military presence is also a major issue in the campaign for
Okinawa governor in the Nov. 15 balloting.
	   In the earlier hit-and-run, 18-year-old Yuki Uema died Oct. 14
from head injuries, a week after the small motorcycle she was on
got hit.
	   The Marines have repeatedly expressed their remorse and have
paid condolence money totaling 300,000 yen (dlrs 2,600) to the Uema
family, Marine spokesman Capt. Bret Curtis said.
	   It is customary in Japan to offer money in condolence for
deaths.

Poll: Half of Kuril residents would leave if Japan takes over
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Nearly half the residents of the disputed Kuril
islands would move to mainland Russia if the territory is turned
over to Japan, according to a poll released Saturday.
	   The islands off Russia's Pacific Coast, seized by the Soviet
Union from Japan at the end of World War II, are mainly inhabited
by Russians. Both countries claim the islands and the dispute has
prevented them from signing a peace treaty.
	   Fifty-five percent of Russians polled nationwide said they
opposed giving up any part of the islands. In Japan, 63 percent of
those polled supported turning over the islands to Japan, while 21
percent supported joint control.
	   The poll was conducted jointly by Russia's Vox Populi polling
service for the ITAR-Tass news agency and Japan's Asahi Shimbun
newspaper. In Russia, 3,000 people were questioned by telephone
from late September through Oct. 17, including 300 on the Kuril
islands, and 3,000 people were questioned in Japan.
	   ITAR-Tass, which carried the poll, did not give its margin of
error.
	   Forty-nine percent of Kuril residents said they would move to
Russia if the islands are turned over to Japan, the poll said.
	   While they oppose political control by Tokyo, however, residents
of the cash-strapped islands are not shy about seeking economic
support from their richer neighbor. A petition has been circulating
in the Kurils urging local administrations to lease the islands to
Japan or other foreign investors.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin and then-Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto pledged last year they would try to sign a peace
treaty by 2000.
	   Few in either country think that's likely.
	   Just 12 percent of Japanese polled and 25 percent of Russians
said they believed a treaty would be signed by then, ITAR-Tass
said.

Bomb rips through mosque killing 5 worshipers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A powerful bomb hidden in a drain
ripped through a mosque in eastern Punjab province on Saturday
killing five worshippers and wounding 12 others, police said.
	   The bomb was in a mosque in Sialkot, near the border with India
and some 320 kilometers (192 miles) east of the capital, Islamabad.
	   The explosion, for which no one has claimed responsibility, sent
residents fleeing into the street, according to the privately run
News Network International.
	   The mosque belonged to the majority Sunni Muslim sect. Most of
Pakistan's 140 million people are followers of the Sunni sect of
Islam, while the minority are Shiite Muslims.
	   Pakistan's populous eastern Punjab province has for many years
been wracked by sectarian violence involving militants belonging to
the two sects.
	   While most people from both sects generally get along in
Pakistan, well armed militants often clash.
	   The dispute between the rival sect dates back to the seventh
century at the founding of Islam when there was a falling out over
the rightful heir to Islam's prophet Mohammed.
	   More recently, militant Sunni Muslims in Pakistan say Iran is
arming and financing their Shiite enemies. Most Iranians are Shiite
Muslims and deny the charge.
	   Hundreds of people have died in the frequent clashes, many of
them innocent worshipers caught in crossfire.

Asian Rugby Union resolves Thai dispute, chooses new board
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Asian Rugby Football Union ruled Saturday
that a misunderstanding on eligibility rules led to Thailand's
refusal to play against Singapore last weekend, and no action will
be taken.
	   The ruling was made as the union elected a new council and an
honorary secretary-general to replace Decho Sariputra of Thailand,
who stepped down Monday to take responsibility for the fiasco.
	   Jamie Scott of Hong Kong was elected secretary-general and the
union council issued a vote of thanks for Decho's ``outstanding
work ... during his six years of office'' in the unpaid post.
	   Thailand refused to play Singapore on Oct. 24 in the Asian Rugby
Championships, which ends Saturday. The results determine whether
Hong Kong or Japan proceeds to the World Cup.
	   Thailand had objected to Singapore fielding four non-citizens,
despite a pre-tournament vote by nine participating nations to
allow the mixed squad.
	   Thailand, Sri Lanka and Malaysia had voted against the move, but
it was believed they had acceded to the majority decision.
	   Thailand, however, insisted at game time it had not agreed and
refused to play.
	   Decho immediately banned the Thais from the championships, then
reinstated them the next day.
	   On Monday, Decho announced at an emotional news conference that
the controversy had embarrassed the tournament and that he would
not seek re-election to his post.
	   On Saturday, the Asian Rugby Football Union Council said, ``It
is agreed that there was a misunderstanding between Thai Rugby
Union and Singapore Rugby Union.''
	   Also elected Saturday were: Zen Shirai of Japan as president,
Adm Han Sakulpanich of Thailand as senior vice president, and Peter
Duncan of Hong Kong as junior vice president.

Japan's Sugimoto takes sole lead after third round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATO, Japan (AP) _ Shusaku Sugimoto shot a bogey-free 5-under
par 67 Saturday to take a two-stroke lead after the third round of
the 200 million yen (dlrs 1.7 million) Philip Morris Championship
golf tournament.
	   Sugimoto sank five birdies on the 7,176-yard, par-72 ABC Golf
club course in western Japan, bringing his 54-hole total to 203.
	   Carlos Franco of Paraguay had six birdies against two bogeys for
a 4-under 68, bringing the three-day total to 205.
	   One stroke behind at 206 were four Japanese players, including
overnight leader Kaname Yokoo, who matched a par with four birdies
against four bogeys, and Tateo ``Jet'' Ozaki, who had a 1-under 71.
	   Ozaki is seeking his first victory in more than five years and
15th overall.
	   American Brandt Jobe hit a 69 for 207 to share seventh place
with Eiji Mizoguchi, who had a 68.
	   A total of 60 players, including nine non-Japanese, teed off for
the third round after 19 players failed to make the cut after the
second-round Friday.
	   The winner will receive 36 million yen (dlrs 310,000).

Warne bowls in match for first time since operation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Spin star Shane Warne sent a warning
to England's Ashes tourists when he took just three balls to claim
a wicket in his return from injury Saturday.
	   Bowling for the first time in a match since his shoulder surgery
in April, Warne showed positive signs that he might yet win a place
to challenge England in the five-test series starting Nov. 20.
	   While the standard of opposition was considerably weaker than
the English side, Warne impressed with 1-13 off six overs.
	   His third ball for district team St. Kilda had Geelong opener
Rohan Sadler stumped.
	   Warne bowled just one loose ball, which was hit for four, and he
will have another 10 overs in a district limited overs match
Tuesday.
	   ``It's the first time he's bowled without having pain for 18
months or two years,'' St. Kilda teammate and Victoria's state team
spokesman Shaun Graf said.
	   ``He wasn't exactly trying to go through his action, but
certainly put a fair bit on the ball and they were certainly
spinning a good yard. He bowled about three or four balls during
that six over spell where he really gave it a shoulder rotation and
there was no discomfort at all.''
	   Warne, the world's No.1 spinner with 313 victims in 67 tests, is
still hopeful of returning for the Brisbane test.

 &UR; North Korean leader hopes for more economic cooperation with South
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Chung returning home, other details; ADDS
byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By J. H. YUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
 &UR; With AP Photos

<TEXT>
	   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) _ North Korean leader Kim Jong Il is eager
for more economic exchanges with rival South Korea, according to
the chairman of South Korea's largest conglomerate who returned
Saturday.
	   Chung Ju-yung, 84, founder and honorary chairman of the Hyundai
group, is the first known outsider to meet the leader since he took
full power of the Stalinist nation in September.
	   ``General Kim Jong Il and I agree to do everything that will
benefit both countries,'' Chung told a news conference in the
neutral village of Panmunjom after coming home across the heavily
guarded border.
	   Kim told Chung that North Korea has hit oil in its territory and
Hyundai agreed to lay a pipeline to supply the oil to South Korea,
Chung said.
	   Chung refused to divulge other details of his talk with Chung
and seemed a bit puzzled by the North's claim that it has
successfully drilled for oil.
	   But he described Kim, 56, as a ``very kind and respectful young
man.''
	   Kim visited the South Korean businessman at a Pyongyang guest
house late Friday and had a 45-minute talk with Chung and his
entourage, Chung said.
	   The meeting is viewed as the Pyongyang regime's official
blessing to Hyundai's plan to send up to 2,000 tourists a week on
two luxury cruise ships for a four-day tour of Diamond Mountain, a
scenic attraction on the North's east coast, officials said.
	   The sightseeing tour would be the largest inter-Korea joint
venture since the peninsula was divided into the communist North
and the capitalist South in 1945.
	   It is the first major result of President Kim Dae-jung's
``sunshine policy,'' under which South Korea actively pushed for
non-governmental contacts with North Korea, hoping that would help
open up the North.
	   For North Korea, the tour would mean an influx of badly needed
hard currency. The impoverished North now depends on outside aid to
feed its 23 million people.
	   The Hyundai chief, who said Hyundai proposed to build a hotel
and develop spas near Diamond Mountain, began his trip _ the second
such visit in four months _ on Tuesday to discuss proposed
projects.
	   Hyundai also hopes to make headway on a number of other joint
venture projects in the North, including car assembly and
construction of an industrial complex and ship repair yard.
	   South Korean officials had expressed reservations about the
Hyundai plan due to safety and communications concerns.
	   Kim took over leadership duties after his father, Kim Il Sung,
died in 1994.
	   Already the top party boss, Kim completed his ascension to power
in September by becoming chairman of North Korea's National Defense
Commission, which oversees the country's 1.1 million-strong
military.

Chechen president calls rally to address constituents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's president, facing mounting opposition
within his breakaway republic, invited Chechens to an unusual rally
so he could explain his policies, a news report said Saturday.
	   Aslan Maskhadov offered to have people bused in from remote
mountainous regions for the rally Sunday in the Chechen capital,
Grozny, the Interfax news agency reported. He said he wanted to
explain his domestic and foreign policies.
	   Maskhadov urged attendees to leave their weapons at home.
	   Opposition demonstrators have been staging protests for weeks in
Grozny demanding that Maskhadov step down.
	   Maskhadov also fired his foreign minister, longtime ally Movladi
Udugov, Interfax reported. Udugov said it was part of a broader
government reshuffle, but said he would not join the new
administration.
	   Alkhyad Idigov, who headed Chechnya's parliament during its
1994-1996 war with Russia, was named to replace him, Interfax said.
	   No country has recognized Chechnya's claims of independence, and
Russia still considers it a Russian republic.

Schumacher takes pole position, followed by Hakkinen
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUZUKA, Japan (AP) _ Two-time world champion Michael Schumacher
earned the pole position Saturday for the race that will decide the
Formula One championship _ Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix.
	   For the second straight year, the series title will be decided
in the last of the season's 16 races. This time the showdown will
be between Ferrari's Schumacher and McLaren's Mika Hakkinen.
	   Schumacher, who trails Hakkinen by four points in the series,
edged out the Finnish driver by less than a quarter second in
qualifying to secure the top starting spot.
	   Schumacher clocked a lap of 1 minute 36.293 seconds on the
5.864-kilometer (3.643-mile) Suzuka Circuit, followed by Hakkinen's
1:36.471.
	   But Hakkinen, 30, just needs to finish second in Sunday's race
to claim his first world crown.
	   Schumacher not only needs to win. The 29-year-old German also
needs Hakkinen to finish no better than third.
	   Also at stake is the constructor's title, though McLaren's wide
lead will make it all but impossible for Ferrari to catch up. It
would be McLaren's eighth or Ferrari's ninth.
	   Schumacher will start from the pole, with Hakkinen alongside him
on the front row. Hakkinen's teammate David Coulthard earned the
inside position of the second row with the third fastest qualifying
time.
	   Schumacher's teammate Eddie Irvine turned in the fourth fastest
time Saturday to grab the second row's outside position.
	   Coulthard's time was 1:37.496, just ahead of Irvine's 1:38.197.
	   ``We were able to improve the car all the way, to make it
quicker, and we were able to get the balance better. I am very
pleased,'' said Hakkinen. ``At the moment the difference is very
small.''
	   Near the end of the qualifying round, Hakkinen slipped off the
track on turn 17, raising a cloud of turf and dirt with his
spinning rear wheels. He got back on the course immediately but
lost precious seconds and his last chance to beat Schumacher's
time.
	   ``I just went wide,'' Hakkinen said. ``I'm not too nervous about
it. I made the mistake myself. The performance of the car was
fantastic and I am very happy about that.''
	   Schumacher said he was happy to be on the pole but was already
looking toward tomorrow's race.
	   ``Qualifying is one thing but there is no point in celebrating.
Tomorrow is important, it doesn't matter what you do today,'' said
Schumacher.
	   ``It's a long race and we just have to wait until the end and
whoever is going to be better is going to win this championship.''
	   With McLaren and Ferrari occupying the top four starting posts,
the decisive race promises to be hard fought and exciting.
	   Earlier this season, FIA, the international governing body of
automobile sports, clarified that ``driver arrangements within a
team are acceptable,'' meaning that Coulthard and Irvine can both
legitimately do their best to assist their teammates.
	   Last year at Suzuka, Schumacher got an assist from Irvine and
won the Japanese Grand Prix, the 1997 season's penultimate race.
Schumacher had the second best position behind Jacques Villeneuve,
and Irvine started from the second row's inside position.

Singapore unions accept cut in pension contributions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to DELETE misleading 'retrenchment steps' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's unions accepted a proposal on
Saturday which calls for cuts in employers' pension contributions
and allows the government to implement whatever steps it finds
necessary to cope with an economic downturn.
	   The government was expected to recommend sharp wage cuts and
other measures early next month as part of an economic package
being crafted to encourage foreign businesses to stay in Singapore.
	   Singaporeans have been spared the worst effects of the regional
financial crisis which broke out last year, but increasingly fear
has spread that higher wages and business costs have led companies
to abandon Singapore in favor of cheaper neighboring states.
	   Singapore's unions are tied closely to the government and
management in the small city-state, where labor strikes are unheard
of. The head of the National Trades Union Congress, which completed
its three-day delegates conference on Saturday, is a member of the
Cabinet.
	   ``The union delegates accepted the proposed 10 per cent cut in
employers' (Central Provident Fund) contribution as part of the
overall cuts in wage and non-wage costs so that we can regain our
competitiveness,'' the union conference said in a closing
statement.
	   Delegates also adopted a resolution ``pledging labor's full
support to the government in adopting whatever measures necessary
to counteract the effects of the sharp economic downturn.''
	   The delegates expressed confidence that the government would in
some way cushion the cuts in wages and pension contributions, which
many Singaporeans use to make their mortgage payments.

Russia has less than 1 percent of global high-tech market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian companies make up just 0.3 percent of the
world's high-tech market, despite a high level of technological
expertise, the Economic Ministry reported.
	   The ministry's Scientific and Technical Council attributed the
low percentage to a lack of money for research and development, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported Saturday. The council released its
findings at a meeting Friday.
	   U.S. companies make up 36 percent of the global high-tech
market, Japanese 30 percent, and Russian ones 0.3 percent, it said.
The report did not say how many companies that included or define
what kind of companies they were.
	   The council said Russia employs 12 percent of the world's
scientists.
	   Many Russian computer specialists, often trained at prestigious
Soviet institutes, have moved to more lucrative jobs in the United
States and other countries hungry for their expertise since the
1991 Soviet collapse. Russia, meanwhile, has been slow to develop
its own high-tech industry.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _India's government promised Saturday to
bring down the prices of onions and other foods, an issue that has
become central to upcoming elections in the capital.
	   But federal Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha acknowledged that
the states, not the central government, were in charge of most of
the steps considered necessary _ cracking down on hoarders and
ensuring states with surplus onions to got the crop to states with
shortages.
	   ``We are doing whatever is in the power of the government to
control prices and bring them down,'' Sinha said, adding that he
and other ministers would meet regularly to discuss food prices.
Their first meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee, was Saturday.
	   Sinha also announced the 10-percent import duty on lentils and
other pulses would be scrapped. India grows most of its own pulses,
importing very little, so it was unclear how much impact abolishing
the duty would have.
	   The main issue, though, is onions. Unseasonable rains decimated
crops, and since late August, prices of the bulb so important to so
many Indian dishes have jumped from eight rupees (20 cents) a
kilogram to about 60 rupees (dlrs 1.40).
	   ``Onions are on everyone's mind,'' Sinha said.
	   High onion prices have provoked street protests, looting of
trucks carrying onions to market, newspaper editorials and speeches
in parliament. New Delhi is among the places hardest hit, worrying
officials of the Bharatiya Janata Party that governs the city as
they prepare for Nov. 25 local elections. The onion issue could
conceivably topple the government in New Delhi, which is its own
state.
	   Sinha said the federal government, which is also headed by the
BJP, was not stepping in for political reasons.
	   ``''If the consumers are suffering, then what have elections got
to do with it?'' he said.''We are doing whatever is in the power of
the government to control prices and bring them down.''

Filipino congressmen say they won't interfere in Malaysian affairs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The leader of a group of Filipino
legislators who will observe the trial of popular Malaysian
dissident leader Anwar Ibrahim said Saturday they will not
interfere in Malaysia's internal affairs.
	   Rep. Heherson Alvarez, who heads the five-member group, said
they were only concerned about Anwar's human rights and his prison
conditions.
	   Anwar, arrested after he launched a reform movement against
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, has denied the charges
of corruption and sodomy. His trial begins on Monday.
	   ``What we will observe is due process. We will not question why
they are accusing him of sodomy or if it is really illegal under
their laws,'' Alvarez told reporters at the Manila airport.
	   The Filipino legislators will try to determine whether Anwar,
who claims to have been beaten by the police, is being jailed
without the opportunity to defend his rights, he said.
	   ``These are human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration
of Human rights 50 years ago,'' Alvarez said. ``In implementing the
law, in convicting and punishing, human rights must not be set
aside and must be respected.''
	   Rep. Benasing Macarambon, a former political detainee under
Marcos, said he joined the observer team because it was
``commandment of God'' to a Muslim like him to help ``narrow the
gap between two warring or conflicting Muslims.''
	   Alvarez and Macarambon left Saturday for Kuala Lumpur. The three
other members of the group were to follow on Sunday.
	   Amnesty International and several other human rights groups also
plan to send observers to the trial.
	   During Marcos' strongman rule in the Philippines, Alvarez was a
leader of the opposition in exile. He served as environment
secretary under President Corazon Aquino, who helped topple Marcos
in a 1986 ``people's power'' revolt.
	   Also going to the trial is Rep. Agapito Aquino _ brother of Mrs.
Aquino's husband, Benigno Aquino, Marcos' arch-rival who was killed
on his return from self-exile in the United States.
	   Another member of the group is Rep. Loretta Anne Rosales, a
former political detainee and one of the 9,539 Filipinos who won a
class-action lawsuit in Hawaii against Marcos for human rights
violations.
	   The group was emboldened to make the trip after President Joseph
Estrada spoke out against the way Anwar is being treated.
	   Estrada, who calls Anwar a personal friend, was the first
Southeast Asian leader to openly voice his concerns, breaking a
tradition in the region of not commenting on each other's political
situation.
	   Later, Indonesian President B.J. Habibie also expressed his
concern for Anwar.
	   The two leaders agreed to write to Mahathir to ask that Anwar be
held under house arrest during the trial.

<TEXT>
	   INA, Japan (AP) _ The U.S. women's professional golf team
extended their lead to five points over their Japanese counterparts
after the second-round matches Saturday in the dlrs 702,000
Nichirei International tournament.
	   Pat Hurst and partner Hiromi Kobayashi hit the day's best score
of 14-under 58 at par 72, 6,294-yard Tsukuba Country Club, beating
Hiromi Takamura and Aiko Takasu of Japan by nine strokes.
	   Lisa Hackney paired with Charlotta Sorenstam for a 64-under for
a 4-stroke victory over Japanese pair Yuri Fudoh and Nayoko
Yoshikawa.
	   The U.S. team won four other games and lost two, with one tie
for a 6.5-2.5 lead in the three-day match play.
	   Each side is made up of 18 players. The first two rounds are
four-ball stroke play, in which winning pairs earn a point for
their team while a tie earns a half point.
	   Sunday's final round will feature individual stroke-play
matches.
	   The U.S. team is trying for its 14th straight triumph in the
Nichirei tournament _ Japan's version of the Ryder Cup. The U.S.
squad has a 17-2 record overall since 1979. Each member of the
winning team Sunday will receive dlrs 25,000.

Thousands of Filipino illegal workers face arrest in Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Tens of thousands of Filipinos
working illegally in Malaysia face arrest after an amnesty expires
on Saturday, a government-controlled newspaper reported.
	   The Journal, quoting an unidentified official of the Philippine
Department of Foreign Affairs, said only 2 percent of 96,803 the
Filipino migrants have applied for the two-month amnesty, which
ends Oct. 31.
	   All those detained after that will be fined about dlrs 750 and
then repatriated.
	   The report said there were fears that Philippine President
Joseph Estrada's open support for jailed Malaysian dissident leader
Anwar Ibrahim could be a factor behind the crackdown on Filipino
workers.
	   In a crackdown on illegal immigrants, Malaysian authorities want
to deport about 200,000 foreign workers who have no permits to
work.
	   About 800,000 have the necessary papers to work in Malaysia. The
bulk of them come from Indonesia. The rest come from Bangladesh and
the Philippines.
	   Philippine government records indicate that most of the illegal
Filipino workers are in the east Malaysian state of Sabah close to
the southern borders of the Philippines, the Journal said.
	   There was no immediate word from the Malaysian government on
whether the amnesty would be extended.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was quoted by Bernama
national news agency as saying Saturday that his country can save
``substantial funds'' by reducing dependence on foreign workers and
sending fewer students overseas.
	   Two weeks ago, the Malaysian government said productive sectors
facing serious labor shortages will be allowed to recruit foreign
workers, despite the crackdown on illegal immigrants.
	   Malaysian Deputy Home Minister Tajol Rosli Ghazali said the
government had agreed in principle to allowing foreign workers to
work the plantation, construction, manufacturing and hotel sectors.
	   Tajol Rosli said that between January and September last year,
the cabinet committee had approved the intake of 100,000 foreign
workers, including those already in the country, for the plantation
and manufacturing sectors.

Australia stuns defending champions Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Australia stunned defending champions
Germany 2-0 Saturday in its first match of the 20th Champions
Trophy men's field hockey tournament.
	   Germany, which has won the trophy for a record seven times, has
brought in a young side in order to prepare for the 2000 Sydney
Olympics. Without experienced Oliver Domke and Christoph Bechmann,
the Germans never threatened.
	   Jay Stacy led Australia, which won the Commonwealth Games title
in Kuala Lumpur last month. The Australians dominated the Germans
for most of the time and finally broke the ice through Lachlan
Vivian Taylor in the 32nd minute.
	   Taylor grabbed an opportunity from a rebound after Ben Taylor's
hard drive was saved by German keeper and captain Christopher
Reitz. Ben Taylor minutes earlier had missed an open scoring chance
when he had only Reitz to beat.
	   Going 1-0 into the second half, the Australians always had an
edge as Germany's forwards failed to make any significant move.
Adam Commens then sealed the fate with his 41st goal as he pushed
the ball into the net after a fine effort from left flank.
	   Result: Australia 2 (Lachlan Vivian Taylor (32nd minute), Adam
Commens (41st minute); Germany 0.
	   Teams: Australia: Jay Stacy (captain), Adam Commens, Jason Duff,
Troy Elder, James Elmer, Lachlan Dreher, Ben Taylor, Daniel
Sproule, Lachlan Vivian-Taylor, Mark Hickman, Scott Webster,
Stephen Holt, Matthew Wells, Murray Richards, Brent Livermore, Dean
Butler.
	   Germany: Christopher Reitz (captain), Christian Achtmann,
Philipp Crone, Thomas Draguhn, Emmerling Bjorn, Frank Gemmrig, Max
Klink, Benjamin Kopp, Christian Kurtz, Andreas Lante, Christian
Mayerhofer, Bjorn Michel, Ulrich Moissl, Sascha Reinelt, Christian
Schulte, Wein Christian.

South Korea beats Taiwan 81-21
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Singapore-RugbyU-Asia

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ South Korea revived its chances for a place in
next year's Rugby World Cup in Wales by defeating Taiwan 81-21
Saturday at Singapore's National Stadium.
	   After two early losses, South Korea had no chance of finishing
first in the Asian Rugby Football Union championships and
automatically qualifying for Wales.
	   But the win over Taiwan gave it a chance of finishing second,
depending on the winner of the Japan-Hong Kong winner-take-all
match later Saturday.
	   The South Koreans, traditionally Asia's No. 2 team, proved too
big, fast and strong for the Taiwanese.
	   South Korea had the game won in the first half when it ran in
eight tries, four of which were converted, against Taiwan's two
replies.
	   A Japan win would make South Korea equal on points with Hong
Kong and Taiwan.
	   South Korea was likely to have scored the most tries after its
13-try haul against Taiwan, which scored seven tries in its three
matches. Hong Kong scored four in its first two matches and was
unlikely to score many against Japan.
	   The second-placed team in the Asian group qualifies for the
seven-team repechage tournament to be held early next year. Its
first knockout match will be against the third-placed team among
England, Italy and the Netherlands.

Russia's Cabinet meets to debate anti-crisis plan

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov convened Russia's
government Saturday in a special session to finalize the first
comprehensive plan for pulling Russia out of its two-month-old
economic troubles.
	   The program relies on as-yet-unreleased loans from the
International Monetary Fund to plug revenue gaps, Economics
Minister Andrei Shapovalyants said _ even though the IMF has
promised no such aid.
	   IMF officials failed to reach agreement with Russian officials
this week on resuming a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package, reached
this summer but frozen after Russia defaulted on some debts and
devalued the ruble Aug. 17.
	   The government, named after Yeltsin fired its predecessor in the
fallout of those events, has been criticized for dragging its feet
on a blueprint for solving the crisis. The IMF has demanded to see
Russia's anti-crisis plan and signs it is being implemented before
resuming payments.
	   The plan, calling for a ``softer social policy'' amid Russia's
worst economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse, took into
account the IMF's suggestions, First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri
Maslyukov's office said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The version discussed Saturday foresees lowering profit taxes
and VAT, Shapovalyants said, Interfax reported.
	   Versions of the plan released this week included measures to
control prices of some food and medicine, stabilize the financial
system and prop up the ruble. It would streamline the budget
system, restore production and improve tax collection.
	   The Cabinet ministers were also expected to discuss a rehaul of
the banking sector.
	   Primakov has said the government would approve the plan
Saturday, though it was unclear how effective it would be or how
many of the measures would be carried out.
	   The IMF said Friday the two sides made progress in talks, but
the government hadn't yet made up its mind on key issues such as
its budget for 1999.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said Friday that Russia
had come to ``mutually acceptable'' terms with holders of the
country's defaulted treasury debt. The two sides have been meeting
in London.
	   If the two sides don't reach a deal before Nov. 17, when
Russia's three-month debt moratorium is lifted, foreign banks will
likely launch a rash of lawsuits to freeze the accounts of Russian
banks abroad.
	   Also Friday, Russian government officials began a second round
of talks with a U.S. government delegation to discuss the
possibility of U.S. food aid to Russia this winter.

Palestinian Authority continues crackdown, approves accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Cracking down on militants and
ratifying the new Mideast peace accord, Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority is hoping to curtail any chances of a delay in
implementing the latest land-for-security deal with Israel.
	   After a late night Cabinet meeting Friday, Tayeb Abdel Rahim,
said that the Palestinian Cabinet had discuss an Israeli demand for
the arrest of a senior figure in the militant Islamic Hamas group.
	   Rahim, an aide to Arafat also confirmed that the home of Hamas
spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin had been raided and several
arrests made.
	   Hamas claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing Thursday in
the Gaza Strip which killed an Israeli soldier. Yassin's phone
lines were cut-off a day after the raid and a handwritten letter
sent to news agencies and signed by the ailing Yassin said he had
been placed under house arrest and his bodyguards arrested.
	   ``We consider Hamas' actions irresponsible and against the
Palestinian national interest,'' Rahim said. Rahim said that
Yassin's home had been raided and several arrests were made.
	   Since the attack, more than 100 Hamas activists, including
senior members, have been arrested.
	   Under the new peace agreement, the Palestinians are obligated to
taking stronger measures against militants and their
infrastructure. Without concrete steps, Israel has said it would
not go through with its half of the agreement to cede more West
Bank land to Palestinian control.
	   Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded that
the Palestinian Authority arrest Mohammed Deif, a leader of Hamas'
military wing, Izzedine al Qassam. Deif has masterminded several
terror attacks and has been in hiding in Gaza for three years.
	   Netanyahu said there was ``increasing suspicion'' that Deif was
involved in Thursday's bombing. If he is not caught, Netanyahu
said, more attacks that could derail the peace process are
inevitable.
	   ``This request was not included in the agreement but
nevertheless, the authority is taking measures to maintain its
(security) commitments,'' Rahim said.
	   Palestinian Communications Minister Imad Falouji, a former
member of Hamas, told reporters Saturday he opposed the crackdown
and would visit Yassin at his home. Falouji also said that he had
voted against the new peace accord signed one week ago at the White
House.
	   A majority of the Palestinian Cabinet however voted to approve
the deal at its Friday session in the West Bank city of Ramallah.

Report: Japan has plan to develop four spy satellites by 2002
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Responding to calls to beef up Japan's defense
following a firing of a North Korean rocket, Tokyo has come up with
a plan to develop four spy satellites by 2002, a Japanese newspaper
said Saturday.
	   The Aug. 31 rocket launch was an acute reminder of Japan's
vulnerability to missile attack.
	   With no missile-detecting system, Tokyo did not know that North
Korea had fired a rocket that flew over Japan and crashed into the
Pacific Ocean, until it received word from the U.S. military.
	   The Asahi newspaper, quoting unidentified government sources,
said a draft showed that the satellite project will cost 150
billion yen (dlrs 1.3 billion).
	   The project still needs approval by the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party before it can be included in the national budget,
it said.
	   Defense Agency officials were not immediately available for
comment Saturday.
	   Ruling party legislators have said earlier that Japan should
develop a joint satellite project with the United States to monitor
missiles.
	   But in the new plan, Japan will develop its own satellite
system, the Asahi said.
	   Another sticking point is Japan's past pacifist policy that does
not allow satellites for military use. The plan will stress the
satellites will only be used for defense, the report said.
	   The North Korean rocket, believed to be a test of its new Taepo
Dong 1, showed that North Korea could strike any part of Japan.
	   North Korea says it sent a satellite into orbit. Japan says
chances for that are slim.

Shell claims to control 70 percent of Malaysian fuels market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Petroleum giant Shell Malaysia
Saturday claimed it controlled 70 percent of the market share with
more than 850 retail stations nationwide, the official Bernama news
agency reported.
	   Shell Malaysia expects its share in the local retail fuel market
to grow, although the industry itself is affected by declining
business, Shell's general manager for retail business, Michael Mak,
was quoted as saying.
	   ``With the expected higher market share achieved, Shell would be
able to expand its operational networks and introduce new products
in the market,'' he told reporters.
	   Shell has invested about 200 million ringgit (dlrs 50 million)
annually for two years to expand its operations. But the economic
slowdown has slashed that amount to nearly half this year.
	   Shell plans to open 20 new outlets next year and introduce new
types of gasoline and engine oils in Malaysia.

Armed assailants kill six in Algeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Armed assailants killed six civilians in
southern Algeria, the security services said Saturday. Witnesses
said the victims had their throats slit and their bodies mutilated.
	   The security services said in a brief statement that the
massacre occurred on Friday in the southern region of Medea, 100
kms (62.5 miles) south of Algiers.
	   No further details were available. The statement described the
bloodshed as a ``cowardly'' attack.
	   Nobody claimed responsibility, but such attacks are blamed by
authorities on Islamic insurgents waging a six-year battle to
topple the country's military-backed government.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have died in violence which began
after authorities canceled 1992 legislative elections in which the
now banned Islamic Salvation Front was headed for victory.
	   Saturday's edition of the pro-government newspaper Jeune
independant claimed that the Armed Islamic Group, the most active
group in the insurgency, had lost 80 percent of its fighters due to
the violence. The newspaper concluded that the depleted group was
now on the brink of defeat.
	   There was no immediate reaction to the report from authorities
or Islamic militants.

Opposition demands sole presidency of Parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's leading opposition party
ruled out sharing the presidency of Parliament with its arch foe
Saturday, insisting it alone must occupy the top position in the
legislative body.
	   Disputes over the presidency have been a major stumbling block
in talks between the two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian
People's Party to form a new government.
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has offered to
share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC party
of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse.
	   The prince's party, in a statement dated Friday and seen
Saturday, said such a scenario was unconstitutional.
	   ``Co-sharing anything with the CPP means surrendering full power
to them. Furthermore, such a proposal is unconstitutional,'' the
faxed statement said.
	   The royalist party also rejected Hun Sen's calls to hold
bilateral talks, insisting that Ranariddh's main ally Sam Rainsy
also be included.
	   ``No party with seats at the National Assembly should be left
out if transparency and a check and balance system is to be used in
government,'' the statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party
should also be given chairmanship of one of the national assembly's
nine commissions.
	   Noting that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency
despite its win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said
it was now its turn to take the post.
	   In the most recent elections, held in July, Hun Sen's party
collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was short of the
two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government.
	   Fearing arrest, many opposition members of Parliament left
Cambodia after the ceremonial opening of the National Assembly on
Sep. 24.
	   A series of negotiations to forge a new government have failed.
The talks have been complicated by the CPP-FUNCINPEC quarrel over
the Parliament's top job.
	   Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh to return to the
negotiation table and said it was willing to make an ``appropriate
concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a government.
	   FUNCINPEC has demanded from Hun Sen written guarantees for the
safety of its members and activities as a precondition for
re-entering negotiations.

Singapore pulls rugby, soccer teams out of Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's rugby and soccer teams have pulled
out of the Asian Games set for later this year in Bangkok,
government television reported Saturday.
	   In the TV report, Lau Teng Chuan, secretary-general of the
Singapore National Olympic Committee, said the teams were not ready
for the competition, although Singapore will be represented in
other sports.
	   The TV report said that Lau also had questions about the
scheduling.
	   Countries were given until Nov. 6 to confirm their
participation, but as early as Sept. 14, Asian Games officials had
drawn lots and fixed game schedules, the report said.
	   Lau was quoted as saying that other countries were also unhappy
about the scheduling but he did not identify them.

Vets find infected bear meat in Russian Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Doctors are warning residents of a port town in
Russia's Far East not to eat local bear meat because some of it is
infected with trichinosis, a news report said Saturday.
	   Authorities found the bacteria while inspecting meat stored in a
freezer at a store in Kholmsk on Sakhalin Island, just north of
Japan's island of Hokkaido, the ITAR-Tass news agency cited
regional veterinary officials as saying.
	   The report did not say whether anyone had fallen ill from the
infected meat, or where the meat had come from.
	   Trichinosis, usually found in uncooked pork, causes fever,
nausea and diarrhea. Scores of people were hospitalized with
trichinosis last year after eating tainted bear meat in Siberia.
	   Hunters in Russia often sell bear meat directly to local shops,
bypassing lengthy and costly inspections.

Afghan opposition says cease fire likely to be extended
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS cease fire possibly extended, CHANGES overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's opposition said Saturday
a week-long truce with the Taliban religious army will likely be
extended to allow the exchange of as many as 2,000 prisoners.
	   The cease fire was to end on Monday, but an opposition
spokesman, who identified himself only as Arif, said both sides
have agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners and more time is needed to
finish the exchange.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Taliban religious army.
	   ``The task of the exchange of prisoners has not been completed.
. . the cease fire date is likely to be extended further,'' Arif
said in a telephone interview from opposition areas north of the
beleaguered capital.
	   The Taliban and the opposition alliance agreed to a week-long
truce to try to negotiate a peace agreement, which is being
brokered by Said Jalal, a close confidant of Saudi Arabia's Crown
Prince Abdullah.
	   Arif said Jalal is meeting the leaders of the two sides to seek
an extension to the cease fire. Jalal also brokered the prisoner
exchange during weeks of shuttle diplomacy between the Taliban and
the opposition.
	   ``We hope there will be an extension,'' he said.
	   Arif said the opposition will release another 100 Taliban
prisoners Saturday in a goodwill gesture.
	   ``We have brought 100 more Taliban prisoners to the front-line
and they will be released sometime today,'' he said.
	   A Taliban spokesman Abdul Hai Muttmayan said Thursday that both
the sides have agreed to release 2,000 prisoners in a phased
exchange ``very soon''.
	   Arif said opposition forces released 50 Taliban prisoners last
week.
	   ``But we are still waiting for the release of our prisoners by
Taliban,'' he said.
	   The truce and prisoner exchange has followed months of bloody
and intense fighting between the Taliban and the opposition
alliance mostly in the northern parts of the country.
	   The Taliban, or the students of Islam, rule almost 90 percent of
Afghanistan including the capital Kabul.
	   Earlier this month, opposition forces led by Ahmed Shah
Massood's Jamiat-e-Islami launched a counter offensive and
recaptured Taloqan _ the capital of northern Takhar province.
	   Massood was a defense minister in the ousted government of
Burhanuddin Rabbani. His Jamiat is the only opposition faction
providing heavy resistance to the Taliban.
	   The Taliban are Sunni Muslim and belong mostly to the majority
Pashtun ethnic group. They follow a strict version of Islam that
bars women from work and education, bans all sorts of light
entertainment including music and forces men to wear beards.
	   The opposition alliance comprise of religious and ethnic
minorities including Shiites, Hazaras, Tajiks and Uzbeks.

Palestinian Authority continues crackdown, approves accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Cracking down on militants and
ratifying the new Mideast peace accord, Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority is hoping to curtail any chances of a delay in
implementing the latest land-for-security deal with Israel.
	   After a late night Cabinet meeting Friday, Tayeb Abdel Rahim,
said the Palestinian Cabinet had discussed an Israeli demand for
the arrest of a senior figure in the militant Islamic Hamas group.
	   Rahim, an aide to Arafat also confirmed that the home of Hamas
spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin had been raided and several
arrests made.
	   Hamas claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing Thursday in
the Gaza Strip which killed an Israeli soldier. Yassin's phone
lines were disconnected a day after the raid and a handwritten
letter sent to news agencies and signed by the ailing Yassin said
he had been placed under house arrest and his bodyguards arrested.
	   ``We consider Hamas' actions irresponsible and against the
Palestinian national interest,'' Rahim said.
	   Since the attack, more than 100 Hamas activists, including
senior members, have been arrested.
	   Under the new peace agreement, the Palestinians are obligated to
taking stronger measures against militants and their
infrastructure. Without concrete steps, Israel has said it would
not go through with its half of the agreement to cede more West
Bank land to Palestinian control.
	   Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded that
the Palestinian Authority arrest Mohammed Deif, a leader of Hamas'
military wing, Izzedine al Qassam. Deif has masterminded several
terror attacks and has been in hiding in Gaza for three years.
	   Netanyahu said there was ``increasing suspicion'' that Deif was
involved in Thursday's bombing. If he is not caught, Netanyahu
said, more attacks that could derail the peace process are
inevitable.
	   ``This request was not included in the agreement but
nevertheless, the authority is taking measures to maintain its
(security) commitments,'' Rahim said.
	   Palestinian Communications Minister Imad Falouji, a former
member of Hamas, told reporters Saturday he opposed the crackdown
and would visit Yassin at his home. Falouji also said that he had
voted against the new peace accord signed one week ago at the White
House.
	   A majority of the Palestinian Cabinet however voted to approve
the deal at its Friday session in the West Bank city of Ramallah.

Sri Lankan captain sues three newspapers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan cricket captain Arjuna
Ranatunge is suing three newspapers for publishing his criticism by
the country's Olympic chief for not playing in last month's Asian
Games, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Lawyers for Ranatunge on Friday filed a petition in Colombo's
district court, suing the independently owned Island, Divaina and
Weekend Express each for 100 million rupees (dlrs 1.5 million), the
Daily News reported.
	   The newspapers in September published comments by National
Olympic Committee President Hemasiri Fernando, who said Ranatunge
had kept the entire national cricket team away from the games in
the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lampur because there wasn't any
money to be won.
	   The second string team sent by world champion Sri Lanka failed
to win even a bronze.
	   Ranatunge is not suing Fernando, who is also Secretary to Prime
Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Ranatunge's father, Reggie
Ranatunge, is a junior minister in the Cabinet, a coalition which
is dominated by Mrs. Bandaranaike's Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
	   In his lawsuit, Ranatunge says the team was selected by the
Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka, which was anxious to
rest key players who must face a grueling schedule ahead of their
defense of the World Cup in England next summer.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Riot police scuffled Saturday with
protesters to try to prevent them from demonstrating against
Zimbabwe's military intervention in Congo and against the
government's domestic authoritarian policies.
	   Scores of riot police sealed off a downtown square, blocked
streets leading to the main gathering point nearby and turned back
cars and at least eight buses ferrying protesters from townships
around Harare, protest organizers said.
	   Groups of banner-waving demonstrators were surrounded by police.
In scuffles, police tore several banners from marchers and
attempted to arrest protest leaders, who took refuge at Harare's
Roman Catholic Cathedral and sang hymns and knelt in prayer.
	   Police withdrew from the cathedral grounds after appeals from a
priest speaking for Archbishop Patrick Chakaipa.
	   Senior police officers said they were ordered to disperse the
protesters. Organizers said the police action was illegal.
	   ``Our constitutional rights for peaceful freedom of movement and
expression have been stifled,'' said Isaac Maphosa, an organizer
for an alliance of civic groups known as the National
Constitutional Assembly that is pressing for political reform.
	   ``Our government won't accept criticism and fears democracy.
People want transitional change,'' said Maphosa.
	   Maphosa said police on Wednesday agreed to the alliance's march
and promised to provide an escort along the route.
	   They gave no indication why their decision was reversed other
than to say
	   ``we have orders from the top,'' Maphosa said.
	   Police made no arrests.
	   Protesters chanted ``Say no to intervention'' in Congo and ``Our
hospitals have no drugs.'' One banners criticizing President Robert
Mugabe said ``Down with Dictators.''
	   Zimbabwe's five main human rights groups on Thursday criticized
Mugabe's military support for embattled Congolese President Laurent
Kabila. Zimbabwe has deployed 6,000 troops to Congo.
	   Pressure has mounted on Mugabe over an estimated 15 million
Zimbabwe dollars (dlrs 430,000) being spent a day on Zimbabwe's
military operations in Congo while inflation and unemployment soars
at home and health and educations services deteriorate sharply.

Thousands of military personnel on alert in flooding region

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Facing continuing threats of
flooding, up to 1,000 military personnel were put on standby
Saturday in the eastern and northern Netherlands to deter
floodwaters.
	   In recent days, this largely below-sea-level country has been
struck by higher-than-normal levels of rain, causing massive
flooding in the Groningen and Drenthe provinces.
	   Although the danger of large-scale flooding has slowly
diminished with receding water levels, conditions in some areas
still remained critical, Dutch television reported. No evacuations
have been carried out, but the troops were placed on alert as a
precaution.
	   Rising water levels also were recorded for two rivers in the
central Netherlands _ the IJssel and the Vecht _ which were bearing
the brunt of torrential rains from nearby Germany.
	   On Friday, the Dutch government outlined a plan to compensate
farmers whose crops have been destroyed by floodwaters. Their
losses have been pegged at 250 million guilders (dlrs 140 million).
Homeowners will also be eligible for state aid to cover uninsured
damage.
	   News of the financial rescue followed visits by Dutch officials,
including Queen Beatrix, who visited flooded regions on Friday to
console farmers and evacuees.
	   Royal Dutch Air Force planes have been flying photo
reconnaissance missions over the flooded region to monitor the
situation.

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels in northern Uganda abducted 30
people but later freed an undetermined number of disabled and
elderly and took the healthy ones, a radio station reported
Saturday.
	   The abductions occurred during a raid on a village near Sudan's
border Friday by about 40 rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army who
are to topple President Yoweri Museveni's government, said the
privately-owned Central Broadcasting Service.
	   The broadcast gave no figures of the people freed or those
abducted. It said the captives were young and healthy males.
	   According to the broadcast, the rebels were apparently shifting
camp around Kilak hills near the administrative town of Atiak,
about 440 kilometers (273 miles) north of Kampala.
	   Military and government officials could not be immediately
reached for comment Saturday.
	   The rebels routinely abduct young people, including school
children. Most of those abducted are forced to become fighters or
porters or concubines.
	   LRA activities along the northern border with Sudan have driven
more than 200,000 people from their homes.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Mazinho and Yutaka Akita each headed in a goal in
the first half Saturday as the Kashima Antlers shutout Bellmare
Hiratsuka 2-0 to keep their lead in Japan's 18-team professional
soccer league.
	   Just one point behind was Jubilo Iwata, who beat the Shimizu
S-Pulse 1-0.
	   Striker Mazinho of Brazil headed in a missed pass by a Bellmare
defender in the 15th minute. Defender Akita's goal followed in the
40th minute.
	   The Antlers, now with their 10th straight win, lead the J-League
with 34 points after 14 matches in the second stage.
	   Masashi Nakayama scored Jubilo's winning goal from the penalty
spot after a foul on Toshiya Fujita two minutes into the second
half.
	   Nakayama's goal marked a new league season record of 33 goals.
The previous record of 32 was set by Urawa Reds Masahiro Fukuda in
1995.
	   Masayuki Okano scored the only goal of the match in the 74th
minute on a defense mix-up, lifting the Reds to a 1-0 victory over
Gamba Osaka and fourth place in the league.
	   The Yokohama Marinos slipped to fifth, trounced by Kyoto Purple
Sanga 2-1. Kyoto's Hisashi Kurosaki fired a winning shot in the
77th minute for Kyoto.
	   Nagoya Grampus Eight remained sixth with a 4-2 victory at home
over Kashiwa Reysol. Tetsuya Okayama contributed two second-half
goals for Grampus.
	   At Yokohama, forward Takayuki Yoshida had a hat trick as the
Yokohama Flugels shutout Cerezo Osaka 7-0.
	   Elsewhere in the league, Consadole Sapporo beat Verdy Kawasaki
2-1, and Vissel Kobe edged Avispa Fukuoka 2-1.
	   Bottom club JEF United Ichihara beat Hiroshima Sanfrecce 6-5 on
penalties after both sides failed to score in 120 minutes.

Russia's Cabinet meets to debate anti-crisis plan

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's government on Saturday approved its first
comprehensive plan for pulling the country out of its two-month-old
economic troubles, promising some price controls and support for
industries.
	   While the economics minister said the plan relies on
as-yet-unreleased money loans from the International Monetary Fund,
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Russia would survive with or
without foreign aid.
	   ``It would be easier for us to stand on our feet if we get
(outside) support, but if we don't get it Russia will neither lie
down nor fall on its knees,'' Primakov told reporters after the
special Saturday Cabinet meeting.
	   IMF officials failed to reach agreement with Russian officials
this week on resuming a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package, reached
this summer but frozen after Russia defaulted on some debts and
devalued the ruble Aug. 17.
	   The government, named after Yeltsin fired its predecessor in the
fallout of those events, has been criticized for dragging its feet
on a blueprint for solving the worst crisis since the 1991 Soviet
collapse. The IMF has demanded to see Russia's anti-crisis plan and
signs it is being implemented before resuming payments.
	   It was unclear how effective the plan approved Saturday would be
or how many of the measures would be carried out.
	   The plan, calling for a ``softer social policy,'' took into
account the IMF's suggestions, First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri
Maslyukov's office said.
	   Primakov said the government agreed with some of the advice but
not all. He did not elaborate.
	   He said the plan includes price controls for medicines but not
food, and said the government would crackdown on corruption and
support key industries.
	   He also said Russia will likely print more money to cover its
massive debts, ``but the amount would be minimal and we will not
allow it to lead to high inflation.''
	   The version discussed Saturday foresees lowering profit taxes
and VAT, Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants said, according to
the Interfax news agency.
	   The Cabinet ministers were also expected to discuss a rehaul of
the banking sector.
	   The IMF said Friday the two sides made progress in talks, but
the government hadn't yet made up its mind on key issues such as
its budget for 1999.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said Friday that Russia
had come to ``mutually acceptable'' terms with holders of the
country's defaulted treasury debt. The two sides have been meeting
in London.
	   If the two sides don't reach a deal before Nov. 17, when
Russia's three-month debt moratorium is lifted, foreign banks will
likely launch a rash of lawsuits to freeze the accounts of Russian
banks abroad.
	   Also Friday, Russian government officials began a second round
of talks with a U.S. government delegation to discuss the
possibility of U.S. food aid to Russia this winter.

Hong Kong posts deficit of dlrs 5.46 billion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong posted a 42.6 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.46 billion) in the first six months of this
fiscal year, the government reported Saturday.
	   A statement said expenditure in the period amounted to 115.2
billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 14.76 billion), while revenue
totaled 72.6 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 9.30 billion).
	   Hong Kong's fiscal reserves stood at 417.9 billion Hong Kong
dollars (dlrs 53.5 billion), a decrease of 39.6 billion Hong Kong
dollars (dlrs 5.07 billion) since the end of March. Hong Kong's
fiscal year began in April.
	   The government said it was not unusual to register a deficit in
the first half of the fiscal year because most tax collections are
received in the second half.
	   The government said it will release a monthly summary of its
financial results to meet standards set by the International
Monetary Fund.

Palestinian Authority continues crackdown, approves accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with release of two militants in grafs 2, 5-8; ADDS in
final graf Israel has not yet ratified agreement &QL; 
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Cracking down on militants and
ratifying the new Mideast peace accord, Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority is hoping to curtail any chances of a delay in
implementing the latest land-for-security deal with Israel.
	   However, two days of sweeping arrests were followed Saturday by
the unexpected release of two militant leaders.
	   After a late night Cabinet meeting Friday, Tayeb Abdel Rahim,
said that the Palestinian Cabinet had discuss an Israeli demand for
the arrest of a senior figure in the militant Islamic Hamas group.
	   Rahim, an aide to Arafat also confirmed that the home of Hamas
spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin had been raided and several
arrests made.
	   However, two militants were turned free Saturday. Ismail Hanieh,
a senior Hamas activist was released after being held two days.
Reached by a reporter on his mobile phone, Hanieh said he was out
of jail and would not discuss his case.
	   A Palestinian police official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity said that Nafez Azam, a senior figure in the smaller
Palestinian Islamic Jihad group had also been released. Azam's
arrest was part of an initial crackdown after the group burned
American flags at a rally in Gaza Oct. 24th.
	   The official gave no reason for the releases.
	   Israel has accused the Authority of a revolving-door policy of
rounding up militants and then releasing them without punishment.
	   Hamas claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing Thursday in
the Gaza Strip which killed an Israeli soldier. Yassin's phone
lines were cut-off a day after the raid and a handwritten letter
sent to news agencies and signed by the ailing Yassin said he had
been placed under house arrest and his bodyguards arrested.
	   ``We consider Hamas' actions irresponsible and against the
Palestinian national interest,'' Rahim said. Rahim said that
Yassin's home had been raided and several arrests were made.
	   Since the attack, more than 100 Hamas activists, including
senior members, have been arrested.
	   Under the new peace agreement, the Palestinians are obligated to
taking stronger measures against militants and their
infrastructure. Without concrete steps, Israel has said it would
not go through with its half of the agreement to cede more West
Bank land to Palestinian control.
	   Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded that
the Palestinian Authority arrest Mohammed Deif, a leader of Hamas'
military wing, Izzedine al Qassam. Deif has masterminded several
terror attacks and has been in hiding in Gaza for three years.
	   Netanyahu said there was ``increasing suspicion'' that Deif was
involved in Thursday's bombing. If he is not caught, Netanyahu
said, more attacks that could derail the peace process are
inevitable.
	   ``This request was not included in the agreement but
nevertheless, the authority is taking measures to maintain its
(security) commitments,'' Rahim said.
	   Palestinian Communications Minister Imad Falouji, a former
member of Hamas, told reporters Saturday he opposed the crackdown
and would visit Yassin at his home. Falouji also said that he had
voted against the new peace accord signed one week ago at the White
House.
	   A majority of the Palestinian Cabinet however voted to approve
the deal at its Friday session in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
Israel has not yet ratified the agreement.

Uganda launches a dlrs 30 million HIV-AIDS program
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The government has began a dlrs 30
million AIDS awareness program that will also help victims of the
deadly disease support themselves, it was reported Saturday.
	   The program, which was launched Friday, will run up to the year
2000 and will be financed by the United Nations, the
government-owned New Vision newspaper said.
	   ``The increasing number of HIV-AIDS infected people countrywide
deserves continued poverty eradication assistance to improve their
welfare,'' New Vision quoted Uganda AIDS Commission director,
Omwony Ojok, as saying.
	   The newspaper did not explain how victims of the disease, which
has no known cure, are to be assisted in generating income.
	   Uganda is one of few country's in Africa with an aggressive
campaign on AIDS prevention and the government's open policy in
dealing the disease has attracted massive foreign assistance.
	   Museveni recently called on African leaders to be more

people on the continent, two-thirds of the worldwide total.
	   Uganda, which had the highest AIDS rate in the world in 1982, is
the only African country south of the Sahara to achieve a decline

Palestinian Authority continues crackdown, approves accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with release of two militants in grafs 2, 5-8; ADDS in
final graf Israel has not yet ratified agreement &QL; 
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Cracking down on militants and
ratifying the new Mideast peace accord, Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority is hoping to curtail any chances of a delay in
implementing the latest land-for-security deal with Israel.
	   However, two days of sweeping arrests were followed Saturday by
the unexpected release of two militant leaders.
	   After a late night Cabinet meeting Friday, Tayeb Abdel Rahim,
said that the Palestinian Cabinet had discuss an Israeli demand for
the arrest of a senior figure in the militant Islamic Hamas group.
	   Rahim, an aide to Arafat also confirmed that the home of Hamas
spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin had been raided and several
arrests made.
	   However, two militants were turned free Saturday. Ismail Hanieh,
a senior Hamas activist was released after being held two days.
Reached by a reporter on his mobile phone, Hanieh said he was out
of jail and would not discuss his case.
	   A Palestinian police official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity said that Nafez Azam, a senior figure in the smaller
Palestinian Islamic Jihad group had also been released. Azam's
arrest was part of an initial crackdown after the group burned
American flags at a rally in Gaza Oct. 24th.
	   The official gave no reason for the releases.
	   Israel has accused the Authority of a revolving-door policy of
rounding up militants and then releasing them without punishment.
	   Hamas claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing Thursday in
the Gaza Strip which killed an Israeli soldier. Yassin's phone
lines were cut-off a day after the raid and a handwritten letter
sent to news agencies and signed by the ailing Yassin said he had
been placed under house arrest and his bodyguards arrested.
	   ``We consider Hamas' actions irresponsible and against the
Palestinian national interest,'' Rahim said. Rahim said that
Yassin's home had been raided and several arrests were made.
	   Since the attack, more than 100 Hamas activists, including
senior members, have been arrested.
	   Under the new peace agreement, the Palestinians are obligated to
taking stronger measures against militants and their
infrastructure. Without concrete steps, Israel has said it would
not go through with its half of the agreement to cede more West
Bank land to Palestinian control.
	   Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded that
the Palestinian Authority arrest Mohammed Deif, a leader of Hamas'
military wing, Izzedine al Qassam. Deif has masterminded several
terror attacks and has been in hiding in Gaza for three years.
	   Netanyahu said there was ``increasing suspicion'' that Deif was
involved in Thursday's bombing. If he is not caught, Netanyahu
said, more attacks that could derail the peace process are
inevitable.
	   ``This request was not included in the agreement but
nevertheless, the authority is taking measures to maintain its
(security) commitments,'' Rahim said.
	   Palestinian Communications Minister Imad Falouji, a former
member of Hamas, told reporters Saturday he opposed the crackdown
and would visit Yassin at his home. Falouji also said that he had
voted against the new peace accord signed one week ago at the White
House.
	   A majority of the Palestinian Cabinet however voted to approve
the deal at its Friday session in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
Israel has not yet ratified the agreement.

Flowers and quiet tears as Swedes mourn teen-age fire victims

	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Outside the gutted dance hall where 60
young people died in a raging fire, hundreds of people Saturday
stood quietly in the cold amid flowers and candles as they
attempted to come to grips with catastrophe.
	   In the parking lot that a day before had been a tumult of
ambulances and screams, mourners had laid a 30-meter-long
(100-foot-long) pile of bouquets, candles and cards of remembrance.
	   The cards' inscriptions were brief _ ''I will see you in
heaven,'' ''We miss you'' _ and the people who stood reading them
also had few words.
	   ''I just wanted to show my sympathy. I think about them. There's
nothing else we can do,'' said Caroline Ericsson, who didn't know
any of the fire's victims.
	   For Lasse Gustavsson, having the right words wasn't as important
as showing his face, severely disfigured in a fire. The former
Goteborg firefighter lost his ears, his eyelids and most of his
nose in a gas explosion.
	   By showing up, he said, he wanted to show the victims' relatives
and friends that spirit can help them pull through despair.
	   ''I can't give them hope. Consolation is enough,'' he said, as
people nearby cast uneasy glances at his scars.
	   Many of the 173 people injured in the blaze may have to endure
similar shocked looks the rest of their lives. Authorities say the
explosive fire quickly raised the temperature in the overcrowded
hall to 600 degrees (1,100 F).
	   The cause of the fire that broke out just before midnight
Thursday remains under investigation. Witness accounts have varied
widely, with some reporting smoke coming from the building's cellar
and others saying the fire appeared to start in the ceiling of the
dance hall on the building's second floor.
	   The fire's quick spread has prompted speculation that it could
have been set, but officials also say the explosive spread could
have been because the fire had been burning undetected for some
time.
	   What's known is that the hall was packed far beyond its
capacity. Licensed to hold a maximum of 150, the hall held at least
250 and perhaps as many as 400 when the fire hit.
	   The crowd was mostly teen-agers and mostly immigrants or
children of immigrant parents. They had come for a disco dance
organized by eight party-arrangers whom police have not identified;
the hall was rented by the organizers from the local Macedonian
immigrant association.
	   Officials said the dead and injured were of 19 nationalities,
including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, as well
as people from the current and former Yugoslavia and unspecified
Latin American countries.
	   Identifying the dead was a wrackingly slow process, forcing
relatives and friends already exhausted with dread to wait for
hours at hospitals. Only 18 of the dead had been identified by
midday Saturday.
	   ''The identification is hard because they have no driver's
licenses or other documents _ they were so young,'' said Kerstin
Einarsson of Sahlgrenska Hospital, the largest in the city of
435,000 residents about 300 miles west of Stockholm.
	   The worst previous Swedish fire disaster in modern history was
in 1978 in Boraas, when 20 people died in a hotel fire.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's nuclear command codes remain in President
Boris Yeltsin's ``firm hands'' while he recovers from his latest
ailments at a Black Sea resort, the prime minister said Saturday.
	   Yeltsin, suffering extreme fatigue and high blood pressure,
handed over many responsibilities to Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov last week after doctors ordered him to rest.
	   After a special Cabinet session Saturday to approve a
long-awaited plan to tackle Russia's two-month-old economic
troubles, Primakov said, ``The nuclear briefcase is in the
president's firm hands.''
	   The case is said to contain codes to begin a nuclear attack, to
be used jointly with the defense minister and Russia's chief of
staff.
	   The only time Yeltsin has given up control of the codes was
during his 1996 heart surgery.
	   Yeltsin arrived Friday at the resort of Sochi for a two-week
stay.

Holland beats Spain 3-2 in opening match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ World Cup and Olympic title holders
Holland defeated Spain 3-2 in the opening match of the Champions
Trophy field hockey tournament in Lahore on Saturday.
	   Two strikes from Bram Lomans and a goal from Jacques Brinkman
gave Holland a 3-0 lead. However, Spain, runners-up in the World
Cup at Utrecht, Holland, struck back late in the second half with
Juan Escarre and captain Victor Pujol's controversial goal.
	   Malaysian umpire Surjeet Singh awarded Spain the second goal off
Pujol, although the Dutch players were convinced that the ball had
gone in the goal off their own defender's stick. But Singh upheld
his decision as Holland captain and goalkeeper Ronald Janssen
strongly protested the decision.
	   A defense minded approach from Spain allowed the Netherlands to
strike twice in the first half. Lomans' strong push from his team's
fifth penalty corner in the 21st minute helped his team to move
ahead.
	   Brinkmann then doubled the lead off a rebound when he slotted
home off a 29th minute short corner as Holland led 2-0.
	   Spain forced six short corners in the second half to put
pressure on Holland. However, they could not convert any of them
into a goal. The Netherlands shot 3-0 up when defender Lomans
strong flick in the 44th minute left goalkeeper Ramon Jufresa
stranded.
	   With time running out for Spain, it struck twice in three
minutes late in the second half. Escarre was on target off the 65th
minute penalty stroke after striker Pablo Amat was brought down in
the striking circle.
	   Pujol's goal gave Spain a glimmer of hope, but Holland, looking
for the third title in its World Cup and Olympics crowns, managed
to hold onto its 3-2 lead.
	   Result: Holland 3 (Bram Lomans (21st min, 44th min), Jacques
Brinkman (29th min); Spain 2 (Juan Escarre (65th min), Victor Pujol
(68th min).
	   Teams: Holland: Ronald Janssen (captain, goalkeeper), Bram
Lomans, Danny Bree, Erik Jazet, Tycho van Meer, Peter Windi, Sander
van der Weide, Jacques Brinkman, Piet Hein Geeris, Marten
Eikelboom, Sander van Heeswijk, Jeroen Delmee, Guus Vogels, Teunde
Nooijer, Remco van Wijk, Jaap Derk Buma.
	   Spain: Ramon Jufresa (goalkeeper), Xavier Ribas, Francisco
Fabregas, Juan Escarre, Victor Pujol (captain), Pablo Amat, Jordi
Casas, Javier Arnau, Ramon Sala, Josep Sanchez, Pablo Usoz,
Hernardino Herrera, Miquel Herreros, Rodrigo Garza, Santiago
Ferran, Eduardo Aculiar.

Turkish plane hijacker identified as suspect in teachers' slaying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Police have identified the man who
hijacked a domestic airliner earlier in the week as a Turkish
Kurdish rebel wanted for the 1994 slaying of school teachers in
southeastern Turkey, reports said Saturday.
	   The man, who took 38 people hostage Thursday on the Ankara-bound
Turkish Airlines flight, was shot dead by a commando squad which
stormed the jet. None of the passengers and 6 crew was injured.
	   The hijacking was carried out to protest Turkey's Kurdish
police.
	   The hijacker had boarded the plane carrying false identity
papers, but police identified him as Erdal Aksu, 35, an alleged
member of the Kurdish rebel group PKK, the semi-official Anatolia
news agency said.
	   It was not immediately clear if he had acted alone or on behalf
of the rebel group.
	   Apart from the slaying of three teachers, he was also wanted for
allegedly killing a police officer in the same year, Anatolia said,
quoting police officials.
	   In 1994 several teachers were killed in the southeast in a
campaign by the PKK to disrupt the state-run education system.
	   The use of the Kurdish language in education and broadcasting is
banned in Turkey.
	   The PKK is fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey. The
conflict has killed close to 37,000 people.

	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Outside the gutted dance hall where 60

quietly Saturday in the cold amid flowers and candles as they

Report: Daimler-Ford merger talks collapsed over control issue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Even as Daimler-Benz and Chrysler were working on
their mega-merger plans, Ford was trying to woo the German
automaker into hitching up with it instead, a newsmagazine reported
Saturday.
	   But the talks collapsed because of Ford's insistence that it
retain majority control of the fused company, the Hamburg-based Der
Spiegel said.
	   The magazine said Ford chairman Alex Trotman made the first
overture last fall to Daimler, which he considered to be Ford's
``desired partner.''
	   Several secret meetings between top managers of both firms were
held, Spiegel said.
	   But in April, one month before Daimler and Chrysler announced
their deal, Daimler chairman Juergen Schrempp told Trotman he was
ending the talks. Spiegel said the reason the deal failed was
because the Ford family insisted that the Americans keep control.
	   Under the DaimlerChrysler merger plan, Daimler-Benz shareholders
will control about 58 percent of the new company, and Chrysler
shareholders the rest.
	   A Daimler spokesman said Saturday that it was no secret that his
company had been negotiating with Ford, but refused to comment on
how far the talks had gone.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq announced Saturday that it was halting
all dealings with the U.N. Special Commission, which is charged
with investigating the country's weapons of mass destruction, but
said it would continue to cooperate with nuclear monitors.
	   The decision was announced after a meeting led by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein of the decision-making Revolutionary
Command Council and the ruling Baath Party leadership.
	   Iraq's response followed a decision Friday by the U.N. Security
Council to review Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions _ but
without the guarantee that Iraq had demanded that this would lead
to lifting of trade sanctions.

<TEXT>
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
cannot be lifted until the U.N. Special Commission certifies that
Iraq has eliminated its biological and chemical weapons and
long-range missiles.
	   Under Saturday's decision, the International Atomic Energy
Agency, which is monitoring compliance on nuclear program, will be
allowed to continue its work in Iraq.
	   ``The joint meeting decided to halt all kinds of dealings with
the Special Commission and its chief and stop all their activities
inside Iraq, including the monitoring, starting from today,'' a
government statement said.
	   ``This does not include the International Atomic Energy Agency
period. They can continue their monitoring work,'' said the
statement.
	   The action goes another step in reducing Iraqi cooperation with
the United Nation. On Aug. 5, Iraq suspended inspections by both
the Special Commission and the nuclear teams that were searching
for new sites that might contain illegal weapon. But monitoring
activities by the two bodies had been allowed then.
	   Saturday's statement demanded that in future any material
collected by the Vienna-headquartered IAEA be kept separate from
UNSCOM's findings.
	   It also urged the Security Council to fire UNSCOM chief Richard
Butler, whom Iraq has repeatedly accused of working on behalf of
the United States to prolong the trade sanctions.

Armed policemen ring world's tallest building
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with no major protests. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Hundreds of police reserves
carrying automatic rifles circled the world's tallest building
Saturday, bracing for another round of anti-government protests.
	   More than 100 people gathered after prayers at a mosque in
central Kuala Lumpur and shouted slogans against the government _
the latest in a series of such protest gatherings that have sprung
up in Malaysia over the firing then jailing of popular dissident
leader Anwar Ibrahim.
	   But few protesters turned up until late Saturday evening at the
other places in the main business district where anti-government
campaigners had called for large gatherings.
	   It was not clear whether protesters were deterred by last
weekend's violence or Saturday's heavy police presence and threats
of arrests.
	   A full-scale riot broke out for the first time in nearly three
decades last Saturday, after riot police fired tear gas and water
cannons at a neighborhood mosque.
	   Protesters at the Muslim house of prayer retaliated by hurling
stones and bricks.
	   Hundreds of people have been detained and jailed since Anwar was
fired as Malaysia's deputy prime minister nearly two months ago.
	   Saturday's police deployment came ahead of Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad visit to the Petronas Twin Towers. The skyscrapers
stand in the center of an upscale shopping mall filled with
boutiques and restaurants.
	   Dozens of policemen were also stationed around shopping malls in
downtown Kuala Lumpur, one of the venues of Saturday's planned
protest. A surveillance helicopter hovered overheard and police
trucks with water cannons stood by.
	   Riot police have said they would come down hard on
anti-government protesters, who have said they would target new
areas in their demonstrations Saturday.
	   ``Our uppermost concern is to ensure public order in or outside
the court and we reckon the trial will proceed smoothly,'' said
police chief Abdul Rahim Noor.
	   In recent gatherings, thousands of usually docile Malaysians
have flocked downtown to demand justice for Anwar, although such
gatherings are banned by police.
	   Anwar faces 10 counts of corruption and sodomy, charges he
denies and says are politically motivated. His trial begins Monday.
	   On Friday, human rights activists blamed the police for
instigating the violence last weekend.
	   ``My appeal to calm and tolerance would be to the police, who
are behaving like thugs instead of law enforcers,'' said Tian Chua,
a spokesman for the human rights group SUARAM.
	   Mahathir on Friday called on the foreign media to give a
balanced report on the demonstrations.
	   ``The foreign media portrayed that (the government) is stupid
and cannot administer this country,'' he said. ``To them, only the
white men are clever and can run the country.''
	   He accused protesters of purposely challenging the police to
enable foreign news photographers to portray the local police as
brutal.

About 130,000 illegal immigrants have returned home during amnesty

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ About 130,000 illegal immigrants
have returned to their own countries during the two-month amnesty
period which ends Saturday.
	   Of those, 104,000 were Indonesians and the rest mostly from the
Philippines, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Myanmar, Deputy Home Minister
Tajol Rosli Ghazali said.
	   Most of the illegal immigrants worked in the plantation and
construction sectors, he told the national news agency Bernama.
	   Tajol Rosli said more than 400,000 immigrants were still in the
country, both legally and illegally. Those without work permits
face arrest and deportation.
	   But before they are deported they will be fined 3,000 ringgit
(dlrs 750).
	   The two-month amnesty, which allowed illegal immigrants to
return to their countries without being penalized, was announced on
Sept. 1.

Atherton, Stewart out of tour match
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES at close of play &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ England's top two players Alec Stewart
and Mike Atherton were ruled out of the opening first-class match
of the Ashes tour of Australia on Saturday because of injuries.
	   Captain Stewart has not recovered from the back spasm which he
suffered in a limited overs match Thursday while former skipper
Atherton is out with a hip injury.
	   Nasser Hussain took the helm for the four-day match against
Western Australia at the WACA ground as the tourists downplayed the
injury worries.
	   ``Stewart's back was a little bit stiff. Atherton has deep
bruising in his hip,'' a team spokesman told reporters. ``He's in
no discomfort while batting but it wasn't worth the risk of getting
sore again when he's running around the field.''
	   Both players have a history of back troubles and, despite the
official assurances, it is a far from encouraging start to the
five-test tour.
	   ``I had every intention of playing, but this morning I was not
100 percent right so I was not going to risk making myself worse
and setting myself back further,'' said Stewart.
	   Ben Hollioake and Dean Headley have also experienced injuries
since the team arrived last week.
	   Western Australia batted first in Saturday's match and recovered
well to finish at 265 for six.
	   England had a great start when it claimed the wickets of openers
Ryan Campbell and Michael Hussey in consecutive deliveries with the
score on four.
	   Yorkshire fast bowler Darren Gough struck first when he beat
Campbell for pace and trapped him lbw with a full delivery that
moved slightly into the batsman. Next ball paceman Alan Mullally,
who played Sheffield Shield cricket for Western Australia, had
Hussey caught in slips.
	   Justin Langer shored up his test No.3 spot with a scratchy 85.
He was dropped twice and had a good duel with Gough, who finally
dismissed him caught and bowled.
	   Langer was missed on 51 when he was dropped by Hussain at slip
and on 79 when Mark Butcher failed to hold a difficult chance.
	   Simon Katich scored the first century against England for the
tour, making 106 before he also fell to Gough, who finished with
3-58 off 22 overs.
	   Despite some worrying fielding, England did moderately well on a
flat wicket, especially in the final session.
	   ``Our bowling here has been impressive,'' said Stewart. ``The
scoreboard may not show it, but the pitch is flat and we have put
down a couple of chances and there is a definite improvement from
Thursday.''

	   On Friday, the Security Council had agreed on the broad outlines
of a review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   The decision ignored Russian and Chinese support for Iraqi
demand that the review must lead to the lifting of the sanctions,
which bar the export of Iraq's main commodity, oil.
	   Diplomats said that even if the council ultimately determines
that Iraq has fully complied with all U.N. resolutions, a separate

review.
	   Annan suggested the review to persuade Iraq to rescind its
August decision on suspending cooperation with UNSCOM.
	   That decision was prompted by Butler's refusal to state that
Baghdad had destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The first phase of the review was aimed at assessing Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions on disarmament and the second
phase was to examine compliance with all other resolutions.
	   In periodic reviews since 1990, the council has maintained
sanctions in light of evidence that Iraq continues to conceal
elements of its weapons programs, most recently biological weapons.

South Korea beat Pakistan 4-3 in thriller
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Winning with a combination of agility
and dangerous moves, spirited South Korea shocked host Pakistan 4-3
in a Champions Trophy field hockey thriller Saturday.
	   Asian champion South Korea was inducted in this six-nation
tournament after England pulled out due to security fears, but it
made a terrific start against a revamped Pakistan side. Pakistan
has won the trophy six times.
	   Pakistan scored the first goal when inside right Muhammad Sarwar
found the target off an indirect penalty corner in the fifth
minute.
	   But the Koreans came back roaring with Kim Yong Bae twice
defeating Pakistan goalkeeper Ahmad Alam off short corners in the
13th and the 15th minutes. Kang Keon Wook could have soon made the
scoreline 3-1, but his attempt went over the crossbar.
	   Pakistan forced four short corners in succession with five
minutes from the first half, but failed to capitalize on its
chances.
	   Pakistan equalized just before half-time when Atif Bashir set up
an ideal opportunity for Sarwar at the top of the striking circle.
	   But its poor defense had no answer for the experienced South
Korean forward Kang Keon Wook when he advanced in the second half,
twice beating defenders to score superb goals in the 47th and 53rd
minutes which put the Koreans 4-2 up.
	   With time running out for the home team, spearhead Kamran Ashraf
snatched one back seven minutes from time.
	   South Korean got three crucial points from its first game.
	   Result: South Korea 4 (Kim Yong Bae (13th min, 15th min) Kang
Keon Wook (47th min, 53rd min); Pakistan 3 (Muhammad Sarwar (5th
min, 35th min), Kamran Ashraf (63rd min).
	   Teams: Pakistan: Muhammad Usman (captain), Ahmad Alam, Aamir
Salim, Ali Raza, Imran Yousuf, Waseem Ahmed, Haider Hussain,
Muhammad Sarwar, Kamran Ashraf, Naveed Iqbal, Anis Ahmed, Muhammad
Qasim, Sohail Abbas, Asad Ali Qureshi, Atif Bashir, Babar Abdullah.
	   South Korea: Yeo Woon Kon, Han Beung Kook, Kim Yong Bae, Cho
Myung Jun, Jeong Jin Dong, Hong Kyung Seob, Park Shin Heum
(captain), Song Seong Tac, Kang Keon Wook, Jeong Yong Kyun, Lim
Jeong Woo, Kim Young Kui, Yoo Moon Ki, Kim Jeong Chul, Koo Jin Soo,
Ko Dong Sik.

Danger of flooding remains high in soggy western Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAINZ, Germany (AP) _ Hundreds of soldiers and firefighters
reinforced dams and pumped out flooded cellars Saturday in western
Germany as water levels continued to climb on two major rivers due
to heavy rain.
	   The Rhine was reported rising at Koblenz and the Mosel was
nearing the critical 10-meter (33-feet) mark near Trier, with
low-lying areas already threatened with flooding.
	   With more deluges predicted for Sunday, forecasters were no
longer discounting the possibility of a catastrophe similar to
weeks of flooding along the Rhine in January 1995.
	   In Baden-Baden, which saw its worst flooding in decades late
Wednesday, the Oos river was dropping steadily. Emergency crews
were kept on alert, though, because earthen dams were already so
saturated even smaller amounts of rain posed a threat.
	   Water levels also dropped by more than a meter (yard) on the
Saar River, although several major roads in Saarbruecken, near the
French border, remained flooded.
	   Two hundred soldiers were reinforcing dams along the Hase and
Hunte rivers near Haseluenne and Oldenburg, in Lower Saxony state.
Interior Ministry spokesman Ingo Marek said rain and snow in the
nearby Harz mountains could push water levels higher.
	   Ship traffic remained stopped on the swollen Neckar River and on
the Rhine between Koblenz and Oberwinter. Barges on the Rhine by
Mannheim and Karlsruhe were ordered to move slowly so as not to
damage the shores with their wakes.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq announced Saturday it is halting all
dealings with the U.N. Special Commission, which is charged with
investigating the country's weapons of mass destruction, but said
it would continue to cooperate with nuclear monitors.
	   The decision was made at a meeting led by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein of the decision-making Revolutionary Command Council and
the ruling Baath Party leadership.
	   ``The joint meeting decided to halt all kinds of dealings with
the Special Commission and its chief and stop all their activities
inside Iraq, including the monitoring, starting from today,'' a
government statement said.
	   ``This does not include the International Atomic Energy Agency.
They can continue their monitoring work,'' said the statement.
	   The IAEA is monitoring Iraq's compliance on dismantling its
nuclear program.
	   The announcement was Iraq's expression of displeasure with
Friday's decision by the U.N. Security Council to review Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions _ but without the guarantee
demanded by Iraq that the review would lead to lifting of trade
sanctions.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
cannot be lifted until the U.N. Special Commission certifies that
Iraq has eliminated its biological and chemical weapons and
long-range missiles.
	   Similar refusal to cooperate with the United Nations had almost
led to military retaliatory strikes by the United States and
Britain earlier this year.
	   While those tensions were eased by a Feb. 23 accord, Iraq
confronted the U.N. again on Aug. 5 when it suspended inspections
by both the Special Commission and the IAEA. Their teams were
searching for new sites that might have contained illegal weapons.
	   Saturday's action goes a step further by suspending even
monitoring activities of UNSCOM, which had been permitted to go on
under the Aug. 5 decision.
	   The statement demanded that in future any material collected by
the Vienna-headquartered IAEA be kept separate from UNSCOM's
findings.
	   It also urged the Security Council to fire UNSCOM chief Richard
Butler, whom Iraq has repeatedly accused of working on behalf of
the United States to prolong the trade sanctions.
	   The statement said that its decision to halt cooperation would
hold ``until the United Nations looks at the issue in an honest and
positive way, leading to Iraq's rights to the lifting of the unjust
sanctions.''
	   Its other demand for resuming cooperation was that the U.N.
reconstitute the Special Commission ``to make it neutral and
professional.''
	   Iraq has repeatedly said the U.N. teams included too many
Americans and Britons and some were spies.
	   On Friday, the Security Council had agreed on the broad outlines
of a review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   The decision ignored Russian and Chinese support for Iraqi
demand that the review must lead to the lifting of the sanctions,
which bar the export of Iraq's main commodity, oil.
	   Diplomats said that even if the council ultimately determines
that Iraq has fully complied with all U.N. resolutions, a separate
review of sanctions would need to be held by the council.
	   Iraq's Saturday decision did not specifically mention the
developments at the Security Council. Its statement only said:
``Iraq was disappointed because lifting of the sanctions did not go
in a normal fashion.''
	   What happened at the Security Council is ``due to clear pressure
from America to reject Iraq's rights in explaining its compliance
in the implementation of the Security Council resolutions,'' it
said.
	   The Security Council decision was unanimous.
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, the council president,
said all 15 council members had agreed on the text of a letter to
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the general framework for the
review.
	   Annan suggested the review to persuade Iraq to rescind its
August decision on suspending cooperation with UNSCOM.
	   That decision was prompted by Butler's refusal to state that
Baghdad had destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The first phase of the review was aimed at assessing Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions on disarmament and the second
phase was to examine compliance with all other resolutions.
	   In periodic reviews since 1990, the council has maintained
sanctions in light of evidence that Iraq continues to conceal
elements of its weapons programs, most recently biological weapons.

Pope names new bishop for Cuba
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Continuing to strengthen the Catholic church
in Communist-run Cuba, Pope John Paul II on Saturday named a new
bishop for the diocese of Santa Clara.
	   The Rev. Marcelo Arturo Gonzalez Amador, 42, was named auxiliary
bishop in the diocese, where he already been serving as pastor of
the cathedral in the city.
	   The pope visited Santa Clara in January as part of his landmark
visit to the island.
	   Earlier this year, Cuba's bishops said they expect to hold on to
religious freedoms gained thanks to John Paul's visit but would not
predict if political advances would come next.

North Korean leader approves more economic cooperation with South

	   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) _ North Korean leader Kim Jong Il has
approved a series of multi-million dollar businesses ventures with
rival South Korea, according to the chairman of South Korea's
largest conglomerate who returned from the communist state
Saturday.
	   Chung Ju-yung, 84, founder and honorary chairman of the Hyundai
group, is the first known outsider to meet with Kim since he took
absolute power over North Korea in September.
	   ``General Kim Jong Il and I agree to do everything that will
benefit both countries,'' Chung told journalists in the neutral
village of Panmunjom after coming home across the heavily guarded
border.
	   Chung described the 56-year-old leader, whom he met at a
Pyongyang guest house late Friday, as a ``very kind and respectful
young man.''
	   Kim welcomed Hyundai's plan to send up to 2,000 tourists a week
on luxury cruise ships for tours of Diamond Mountain, a scenic
attraction on the North's east coast, Hyundai officials said.
	   In exchange for the exclusive right to develop Diamond Mountain
for sightseeing, Hyundai agreed to pay North Korea dlrs 942 million
in badly needed cash over the next six years, they said.
	   The sightseeing tour would be the largest inter-Korea joint
venture since the peninsula was divided into the communist North
and the capitalist South in 1945.
	   The first cruise ship will sail for the North on Nov. 18,
Hyundai said.
	   Other Hyundai-North Korea deals called for building a power
plant and gymnasium in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, as well
as a ship repair yard, hotel and spas near Diamond Mountain.
	   North Korea and Hyundai also agreed to drill for oil on North
Korea's west coast and if successful, to lay a oil pipeline to
South Korea.
	   Hyundai will also build an industrial complex where South Korea
can relocate idle facilities to use cheap North Korean labor _
estimated at one-eighth the cost of South Korean labor.
	   President Kim Dae-jung has taken a ``sunshine policy'' toward
the North, in which South Korea push for contacts with North Korea
outside the government, with hopes that will help open up the
North.
	   Kim Jong Il had been widely expected to welcome badly needed
outside capital to revive his country's economy. The impoverished
North now depends on outside aid to feed its 23 million people.
	   His blessing to Hyundai's plans to send tourists to the North
and other projects may signal a greater openness from the North.
	   North Korea has already opened its remote northeast corner of
Rajin-Sonbong as a free economic zone. But some of Hyundai's
projects called for foreign investment in the isolated country's
heartland.
	   South Korea's chief presidential Park Jie-won called Chung's
meeting with Kim ``a very significant development'' but refused
further comment.
	   Experts have expressed reservations about Hyundai plans because
joint-venture projects between the two Koreas have always been
vulnerable to political and military tensions on the divided
peninsula.
	   Still, Chung's extremely rare meeting with the North Korean
leader has set off a media sensation here.
	   The Hyundai chief began his trip _ his second in four months _
on Tuesday to discuss the proposed projects.
	   Kim took over leadership duties after his father, Kim Il Sung,
died in 1994.
	   Already the top party boss, Kim completed his ascension to power
in September by becoming chairman of North Korea's National Defense
Commission, which oversees the country's 1.1 million-strong
military.

Ex-naval officer to file complaints on treason trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An ex-naval officer charged with treason is filing
complaints with Russia's Supreme Court and the European Human
Rights Court over the handling of his case, his lawyer said
Saturday.
	   Alexander Nikitin is accused of giving the Norwegian
environmental group Bellona state secrets on how the Russian navy's
Northern Fleet handles its nuclear waste and reactors.
	   On Thursday, Judge Sergei Golets threw out all the evidence
presented in the indictment and sent the case back to prosecutors
for further investigation.
	   Nikitin and his lawyers plan to complain to the Supreme Court
and the European Human Rights Court in Strasbourg, France, over the
ruling, defense lawyer Yuri Schmidt said.
	   ``We want an end to this strange system that a court can make a
third decision, which is neither guilty nor acquitted,'' said
Schmidt.
	   Bellona said preparations for taking the case to the European
court had been underway since May, based largely on its extended
length. It was more than three years between Nikitin's arrest and
the trial, and Nikitin had not seen the charges against him until
the trial opened earlier this month.
	   Prosecutors say the data gave Bellona constituted a state
secret. Nikitin and Bellona say the information came from public
records, including school textbooks.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The legal establishment's endorsement of a
Spanish judge's pursuit of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet was celebrated by most newspapers on Saturday as a
cutting-edge decision for international law.
	   ``It is the beginning of the end of the impunity of tyrants to
commit crimes against humanity,'' the leading daily El Pais said.
	   Spain's National Court ruled on Friday that its judges were
competent to investigate human rights crimes committed in Chile and
Argentina when military juntas ruled in the 1970s and 80s.
	   The ruling gave Judge Baltasar Garzon a green light to press
ahead with his bid to see Pinochet extradited from Britain to Spain
on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism.
	   An official Chilean government report published in 1991 listed
3,197 people who died or disappeared between the 1973 coup that
brought him to power and 1990 when he stepped down. Garzon has
argued that this was an attempt to eliminate the political
opposition that amounts to genocide.
	   Saturday's papers filled their opening pages with pictures of
joyous relatives of the victims of both Pinochet's dictatorship and
the military juntas of Argentina celebrating outside the National
Court.
	   ``This time the bad guys lost and the good guys won,'' said the
editorial in another leading daily El Mundo.
	   But most papers also noted the extradition attempt was unlikely
to succeed.
	   Pinochet was detained by in a London clinic on Oct. 16 while
recovering from back surgery, but last Wednesday the British High
Court ruled that he enjoyed immunity as a former head of state and
quashed the arrest orders issued by Judge Garzon.
	   The 82-year-old retired general was released on bail Friday but
kept under police guard pending an appeal hearing in the House of
Lords, Britain's highest legal authority, that could allow Pinochet
to go home.
	   The former dictator cannot be prosecuted in Chile because he is
a senator for life, a job created for him in a constitution he
guided to enactment.
	   But according to the Spanish editorial writers such arrangements
are now under threat by the precedent set by Spain.
	   ``The National Court ruling gives shape to an unstoppable
movement towards acceptance that tyrants of all kinds can be tried
independent of immunity deals they have negotiated in their own
countries,'' El Pais said.
	   Meanwhile, Garzon plans to file a formal extradition request
next week, according to members of the team of private human rights
lawyers who have worked closely with Garzon in the Pinochet case.
	   It must first be approved by the government of center-right
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar who is expected to meet his British
counterpart Tony Blair on Monday, although officials said that the
Pinochet case will not be on the two leaders' agenda.
	   Aznar, is eager to protect major Spanish investment in Chile and
important bilateral trade ties and has frowned on Garzon's probe,
but has promised that his government will not block a request for
Pinochet's extradition.

as-yet-unreleased loans from the International Monetary Fund, Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Russia would survive with or without
foreign aid. The plan, calling for a ``softer social policy,'' took
into account the IMF's suggestions, First Deputy Prime Minister
Yuri Maslyukov's office said. Primakov said the plan includes price
controls for medicines but not food, and said the government would
crack down on corruption and support key industries. He also said
Russia will probably print more money to cover its massive debts.

	   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) _ North Korean leader Kim Jong Il has
approved a series of multi-million dollar businesses ventures with
rival South Korea, according to the chairman of South Korea's
largest conglomerate, who returned from the communist state
Saturday. Chung Ju-yung, 84, founder and honorary chairman of the
Hyundai group, is the first known outsider to meet with Kim since
he took absolute power over North Korea in September. ``General Kim
Jong Il and I agree to do everything that will benefit both
countries,'' Chung told journalists in the neutral village of
Panmunjom after coming home across the heavily guarded border.
Chung described the 56-year-old leader, whom he met at a Pyongyang
guest house late Friday, as a ``very kind and respectful young
man.'' (KOREAS-HYUNDAI)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's leading opposition party
ruled out sharing the presidency of Parliament with its foe
Saturday, insisting it alone must occupy the top position in the
legislative body. Disputes over the presidency have been a major
stumbling block in talks between the two-party opposition bloc and
the Cambodian People's Party to form a new government. Cambodian
leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has offered to share the
legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC party of Prince
Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse. The prince's
party, in a statement dated Friday and seen Saturday, said such a
scenario was unconstitutional. The royalist party also rejected Hun
Sen's calls to hold talks, insisting that Ranariddh's main ally Sam
Rainsy also be included. (CAMBODIA-POLITICAL DEADLOCK)
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Tropical Storm Mitch sloshed into
the heart of Honduras on Saturday, spreading death and destruction
throughout the impoverished country already stunned by the storm's
ravaging of the Atlantic seaboard. At least 127 were confirmed dead
in the region. Hundreds of thousands have fled or lost their homes.
And the U.S. Coast Guard said it had not yet found a tourist
schooner with 31 people aboard that hasn't been heard from since
Tuesday. With rainfall of 4 inches (10 cms) an hour at the height
of the storm, downed bridges, rampant rivers, toppled trees and
mudslides isolated hundreds of communities where food, water and
medicine were in short supply. (TROPICAL WEATHER-MITCH)

Hurricane Robin Singh stretches Indian total to 242
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A stroke-filled 83 by Saurav Ganguly
and a hurricane 73 by Robin Singh helped India reach 242 for 6
wickets in the second semifinal against the West Indies in the
Wills International Cup Saturday.
	   Singh battered West Indian bowlers in the last lap of the Indian
innings in the 63 balls he played, helping prop up his team's score
which tottered after a string of dismissals.
	   India lost its anchor batsman Sachin Tendulkar with just 14 runs
off the board, when he was caught brilliantly by Carl Hooper in the
slips on a personal score of just eight runs.
	   Another setback followed when Indian captain Mohammad Azharuddin
was trapped leg before on a delivery from Dillon that sharply
dipped in and caught the batsman on the back foot.
	   Ganguly and Rahul Dravid then repaired the damage, punishing
spinners Hooper and Keith Arthurton.
	   But Ganguly threw away his wicket at 83 when he unnecessarily
stepped out to a wide ball from leg spinner Rawl Lewis and was
stumped, 17 runs away from what would have been his fifth one-day
century. Ganguly hit eight fours and two huge sixes.
	   Dravid and Ajay Jadeja then left in quick succession, but Singh
took charge with some huge hits, including three sixes of which two
came off successive balls.

Media claims Spanish jurisdiction in Pinochet case sets precedent

endorsement of Spanish jurisdiction in Pinochet case; CHANGES

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The legal establishment's endorsement of a
Spanish judge's pursuit of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet was celebrated by most newspapers on Saturday as a
cutting-edge decision for international law.
	   ``It is the beginning of the end of the impunity of tyrants to
commit crimes against humanity,'' the leading daily El Pais said.
	   Spain's National Court ruled on Friday that its judges were
competent to investigate human rights crimes committed in Chile and
Argentina when military juntas ruled in the 1970s and 80s.
	   The ruling gave Judge Baltasar Garzon a green light to press
ahead with his bid to see Pinochet extradited from Britain to Spain
on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism.
	   A Chilean government report published in 1991 listed 3,197
people who died or disappeared between the 1973 coup that brought
Pinochet to power and 1990 when he stepped down. Garzon argues that
this was an attempt to eliminate the political opposition that
amounts to genocide.
	   Saturday's papers filled their opening pages with pictures of
joyous relatives of the victims of Pinochet's dictatorship and the
military juntas of Argentina celebrating the decision outside the
National Court.
	   ``This time the bad guys lost and the good guys won,'' said the
editorial in another leading daily, El Mundo.
	   But most papers also noted that the extradition attempt was
unlikely to succeed.
	   Pinochet was detained in a London clinic on Oct. 16 while
recovering from back surgery, but on Wednesday the British High
Court ruled that he enjoyed immunity as a former head of state and
quashed Garzon's arrest orders.
	   The 82-year-old retired general was released on bail Friday but
kept under police guard pending an appeal hearing in the House of
Lords, Britain's highest legal authority, that could allow him to
go home.
	   He cannot be prosecuted in Chile because he is a senator for
life, a job created for him in a constitution he guided to
enactment.
	   But according to the Spanish editorial writers, such
arrangements are under threat by the precedent set in Spain.
	   ``The National Court ruling gives shape to an unstoppable
movement towards acceptance that tyrants of all kinds can be tried
independent of immunity deals they have negotiated in their own
countries,'' El Pais said.
	   Meanwhile, Garzon plans to file a formal extradition request
next week, according to members of the team of private human rights
lawyers who have worked closely with him on the case.
	   It must first be approved by the government of center-right
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, who was expected to meet his
British counterpart, Tony Blair, on Monday, although officials said
that the Pinochet case will not be on the agenda.
	   Aznar is eager to protect major Spanish investments in Chile and
important trade ties and has frowned on Garzon's probe, but has
promised that his government will not block a request for
Pinochet's extradition.

	   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) _ The chairman of South Korea's largest
conglomerate returned Saturday from a meeting with North Korean
leader Kim Jong Il with exclusive rights to develop a tourism
project in exchange for dlrs 942 million.
	   Kim approved other businesses ventures with longtime rival South
Korea, said Chung Ju-yung, 84, founder of the Hyundai group, and
the first known outsider to meet with Kim since he took absolute
power over North Korea in September.
	   Kim welcomed Hyundai's plan to send up to 2,000 tourists a week
on luxury cruise ships for tours of Diamond Mountain, a scenic
attraction on the North's east coast, Hyundai officials said.
	   In exchange for the right to develop Diamond Mountain, Hyundai
agreed to pay North Korea dlrs 942 million over the next six years,
they said.
	   The sightseeing tour would be the largest inter-Korea joint
venture since the peninsula was divided into the communist North
and the capitalist South in 1945.
	   The first cruise ship will sail for the North on Nov. 18,
Hyundai said.
	   ``General Kim Jong Il and I agree to do everything that will
benefit both countries,'' Chung told journalists in the neutral
village of Panmunjom after coming home across the heavily guarded
border.
	   Chung described the 56-year-old leader, whom he met at a
Pyongyang guest house late Friday, as a ``very kind and respectful
young man.''
	   Other Hyundai-North Korea deals called for building a power
plant and gymnasium in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, as well
as a ship repair yard, a hotel and spas near Diamond Mountain.
	   North Korea and Hyundai also agreed to drill for oil on North
Korea's west coast and if successful, to lay an oil pipeline to
South Korea.
	   Hyundai will also build an industrial complex where South Korea
can relocate idle facilities to use North Korean labor _ estimated
at one-eighth the cost of South Korean labor.
	   President Kim Dae-jung has taken a ``sunshine policy'' toward
the North, in which South Korea push for contacts with North Korea
outside the government, with hopes that will help open up the
North.
	   Kim Jong Il had been widely expected to welcome badly needed
outside capital to revive his country's economy. The impoverished
North now depends on outside aid to feed its 23 million people.
	   His blessing to Hyundai's plans to send tourists to the North
and other projects may signal a greater openness from the North.
	   North Korea has already opened its remote northeast corner of
Rajin-Sonbong as a free economic zone. But some of Hyundai's
projects called for foreign investment in the isolated country's
heartland.
	   South Korea's chief presidential Park Jie-won called Chung's
meeting with Kim ``a very significant development'' but refused
further comment.
	   Experts have expressed reservations about Hyundai plans because
joint-venture projects between the two Koreas have always been
vulnerable to political and military tensions.
	   Still, Chung's extremely rare meeting with the North Korean
leader has set off a media sensation here.
	   Major TV stations stopped their regular programming to carry
special reports on the meeting, and newspapers carried front-page
articles.
	   The Hyundai chief began his trip _ his second in four months _
on Tuesday to discuss the proposed projects.

German foreign ministry says won't intervene in `Mehmet' case _
</HEADLINE>
yet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Foreign Ministry said Saturday it
will not intervene to help secure a new passport for a Turkish
juvenile delinquent that the state of Bavaria wants to deport until
state officials exhaust all other legal means.
	   Bavaria's highest court this month upheld the state's decision
to deport the 14-year-old boy, known only as Mehmet, because of a
string of violent offenses. But his lawyer has asked Germany's
highest court to block the deportation; a ruling is expected in the
next few days.
	   In the meantime, his parents have had Mehmet's Turkish passport
declared void and refuse to give permission for a new one to be
issued. Without valid travel documents, the boy can not be
deported.
	   Bavarian officials said they would ask the Foreign Ministry to
take the issue up with Turkish officials in Ankara.
	   But Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said his office
would not do so until all legal avenues in Germany are exhausted.
	   Although a passport for a minor can not be issued without the
parents' consent, Bavarian officials could ask a German court to
force the boy's parents to comply.
	   The Mehmet case made headlines nationwide this summer when
Bavarian officials sought to deport not only the boy, who was born
and raised in Munich, but also his parents, who have lived and
worked in Germany for 30 years.
	   Although the parents had never been in trouble with the law,
they were accused of endangering public safety by failing to raise
their son properly.
	   Courts have so far blocked the deportation of the parents, but
the case became an election-year rallying point for conservatives
demanding a crackdown on foreigners who break German law.

Iraq suspends relations with U.N. inspectors, monitors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to raise significance of decision; EDITS to trim &QL; 
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq announced Saturday it is halting all
dealings with the U.N. Special Commission, breaking a last tenuous
link with the body charged with investigating the country's weapons
of mass destruction.
	   The decision was made at a meeting led by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein of the decision-making Revolutionary Command Council and
the ruling Baath Party leadership.
	   ``The joint meeting decided to halt all kinds of dealings with
the Special Commission and its chief and stop all their activities
inside Iraq, including the monitoring, starting from today,'' a
government statement said.
	   The stage for confrontation was set Aug. 5 when Iraq barred the
Special Commission's inspectors from visiting new sites with
suspected links to biological and chemical weapons and long-range
missiles. But it had allowed UNSCOM experts to monitor previously
surveyed locations.
	   Saturday's decision ends even the monitors' work, which includes
maintaining cameras and electronic sensors to ensure that Iraq does
not re-use the sites for illegal activities.
	   However, Iraq said monitoring by the International Atomic Energy
Agency can continue. New inspections by the IAEA, which was
separately overseeing Iraq's compliance on ending its nuclear
program, were also stopped Aug. 5.
	   Saturday's action was the strongest since a similar refusal to
cooperate with UNSCOM almost led to retaliatory military strikes by
the United States and Britain earlier this year. Tensions were
eased by a Feb. 23 accord.
	   At the beginning of that crisis late last year, the United
Nations had pulled out its inspectors. It is not clear if the
latest development will trigger a similar evacuation of monitors.
	   The decision to sever relations with UNSCOM followed a U.N.
Security Council decision Friday to review Iraq's compliance with
U.N. resolutions _ but without the guarantee demanded by Iraq that
the review must lead to lifting of trade sanctions.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
cannot be lifted until the U.N. Special Commission certifies that
Iraq has eliminated its mass destruction weapons.
	   Saturday's statement urged the Security Council to fire UNSCOM
chief Richard Butler, whom Iraq has repeatedly accused of working
on behalf of the United States to prolong the trade sanctions that
bar Iraq's main commodity, oil.
	   The statement said that its decision will stay ``until the
United Nations looks at the issue in an honest and positive way,
leading to Iraq's rights to the lifting of the unjust sanctions.''
	   Its other demand for resuming cooperation was that the U.N.
reconstitute the Special Commission ``to make it neutral and
professional.''
	   Iraq has repeatedly said the U.N. teams included too many
Americans and Britons and some were spies.
	   On Friday, the Security Council had agreed on the broad outlines
of a review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   Diplomats said that even if the council ultimately determines
that Iraq has fully complied with all U.N. resolutions, a separate
review of sanctions would need to be held by the council.
	   Iraq's response did not specifically mention the developments at
the Security Council. Its statement only said: ``Iraq was
disappointed because lifting of the sanctions did not go in a
normal fashion.''
	   What happened at the Security Council is ``due to clear pressure
from America to reject Iraq's rights in explaining its compliance
in the implementation of the Security Council resolutions,'' it
said.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan suggested the review to
persuade Iraq to rescind its Aug. 5 decision, which was prompted by
Butler's refusal to state that Baghdad had destroyed all its
illegal weapons.
	   The first phase of the review was aimed at assessing Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions on disarmament and the second
phase was to examine compliance with all other resolutions.
	   In periodic reviews since 1990, the council has maintained
sanctions in light of evidence that Iraq continues to conceal
elements of its weapons programs, most recently biological weapons.

Iraq suspends relations with U.N. inspectors, monitors

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq announced Saturday that it is halting
all dealings with the U.N. Special Commission, breaking a last
tenuous link with the international body investigating the
country's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The decision was made at a meeting led by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein of the decision-making Revolutionary Command Council and
the ruling Baath Party leadership.
	   ``The joint meeting decided to halt all kinds of dealings with
the Special Commission and its chief and stop all their activities
inside Iraq, including the monitoring, starting from today,'' a
government statement said.
	   The stage for confrontation was set Aug. 5 when Iraq barred the
Special Commission's inspectors from visiting new sites with
suspected links to biological and chemical weapons and long-range
missiles. It did allowed continued monitoring of previously
surveyed locations.
	   Saturday's decision ends even the monitors' work, which includes
maintaining cameras and electronic sensors to ensure that Iraq does
not use the sites for illegal activities.
	   However, Iraq said monitoring by the International Atomic Energy
Agency can continue. New inspections by the IAEA, which was
separately overseeing Iraq's compliance on ending its nuclear
program, were also stopped Aug. 5.
	   Saturday's action was the strongest since a similar refusal to
cooperate with the Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, almost led
to military strikes by the United States and Britain earlier this
year. Tensions were eased by a Feb. 23 accord.
	   At the beginning of that crisis, late last year, the United
Nations pulled out its inspectors. It is not clear if the latest
development will trigger a similar evacuation of monitors.
	   The decision to sever relations with UNSCOM followed a U.N.
Security Council decision Friday to review Iraq's compliance with
U.N. resolutions _ but without the guarantee demanded by Iraq that
the review lead to lifting of trade sanctions.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
cannot be lifted until the U.N. Special Commission certifies that
Iraq has eliminated its mass destruction weapons.
	   Saturday's statement urged the Security Council to fire UNSCOM
chief Richard Butler, whom Iraq has repeatedly accused of working
on behalf of the United States to prolong the sanctions that bottle
up Iraq's main commodity, oil.
	   The government said that its decision will stand ``until the
United Nations looks at the issue in an honest and positive way,
leading to Iraq's rights to the lifting of the unjust sanctions.''
	   Its other demand for resuming cooperation was that the U.N.
reconstitute the Special Commission ``to make it neutral and
professional.''
	   Iraq has repeatedly said the U.N. teams included too many
Americans and Britons and that some have been spies.
	   On Friday, the Security Council agreed on the broad outline of a
review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   Diplomats said that even if the council ultimately determines
that Iraq has fully complied with all U.N. resolutions, a separate
review of sanctions would need to be held by the council.
	   Iraq's response did not specifically mention the developments in
the Security Council. Its statement only said: ``Iraq was
disappointed because lifting of the sanctions did not go in a
normal fashion.''
	   What happened at the Security Council is ``due to clear pressure
from America to reject Iraq's rights in explaining its compliance
in the implementation of the Security Council resolutions,'' it
said.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan suggested the review to
persuade Iraq to rescind its Aug. 5 decision, which was prompted by
Butler's refusal to state that Baghdad had destroyed all its
illegal weapons.
	   The first phase of the review was aimed at assessing Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions on disarmament and the second
phase was to examine compliance with all other resolutions.
	   In periodic reviews since 1990, the council has maintained
sanctions in light of evidence that Iraq continues to conceal
elements of its weapons programs, most recently biological weapons.

	   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) _ The chairman of South Korea's largest
conglomerate returned Saturday from a meeting with North Korean
leader Kim Jong Il with exclusive rights to develop a tourism
project in exchange for dlrs 942 million.
	   Kim approved other businesses ventures with longtime rival South
Korea, said Chung Ju-yung, 84, founder of the Hyundai group, and
the first known outsider to meet with Kim since he took absolute
power over North Korea in September.
	   Kim welcomed Hyundai's plan to send up to 2,000 tourists a week
on luxury cruise ships for tours of Diamond Mountain, a scenic
attraction on the North's east coast, Hyundai officials said.
	   In exchange for the right to develop Diamond Mountain, Hyundai
agreed to pay North Korea dlrs 942 million over the next six years,
they said.
	   The sightseeing tour would be the largest inter-Korea joint
venture since the peninsula was divided into the communist North
and the capitalist South in 1945.
	   The first cruise ship will sail for the North on Nov. 18,
Hyundai said.
	   ``General Kim Jong Il and I agree to do everything that will
benefit both countries,'' Chung told journalists in the neutral
village of Panmunjom after coming home across the heavily guarded
border.
	   Chung described the 56-year-old leader, whom he met at a
Pyongyang guest house late Friday, as a ``very kind and respectful
young man.''
	   Other Hyundai-North Korea deals called for building a power
plant and gymnasium in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, as well
as a ship repair yard, a hotel and spas near Diamond Mountain.
	   North Korea and Hyundai also agreed to drill for oil on North
Korea's west coast and if successful, to lay an oil pipeline to
South Korea.
	   Hyundai will also build an industrial complex where South Korea
can relocate idle facilities to use North Korean labor _ estimated
at one-eighth the cost of South Korean labor.
	   President Kim Dae-jung has taken a ``sunshine policy'' toward
the North, in which South Korea push for contacts with North Korea
outside the government, with hopes that will help open up the
North.
	   Kim Jong Il had been widely expected to welcome badly needed
outside capital to revive his country's economy. The impoverished
North now depends on outside aid to feed its 23 million people.
	   His blessing to Hyundai's plans to send tourists to the North
and other projects may signal a greater openness from the North.
	   North Korea has already opened its remote northeast corner of
Rajin-Sonbong as a free economic zone. But some of Hyundai's
projects called for foreign investment in the isolated country's
heartland.
	   South Korea's chief presidential Park Jie-won called Chung's
meeting with Kim ``a very significant development'' but refused
further comment.
	   Experts have expressed reservations about Hyundai plans because
joint-venture projects between the two Koreas have always been
vulnerable to political and military tensions.
	   Still, Chung's extremely rare meeting with the North Korean
leader has set off a media sensation here.
	   Major TV stations stopped their regular programming to carry
special reports on the meeting, and newspapers carried front-page
articles.
	   The Hyundai chief began his trip _ his second in four months _
on Tuesday to discuss the proposed projects.

Flowers and quiet tears as Swedes mourn teen-age fire victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with comment on initial confusion
in alarm, CORRECT number of injured to 162 to reflect official
revision. &QL;

	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ A panicky telephone call in poor Swedish
was the first word that authorities got of a fire racing through a
dance hall crowded with immigrant teen-agers, delaying fire squads'
response to the blaze that killed 60 and injured 162, officials
said Saturday.
	   Per-Olof Ortarsen of Goteborg's emergency services line said the
call was so hard to understand that it took three minutes for
workers to figure out what was going on and where to send fire
trucks.
	   The first fire trucks and rescue squads were on the scene six
minutes after the call was received, Ortarsen told a news
conference. He and other officials declined to comment on whether a
quicker response could have saved any of the mostly immigrant
victims.
	   But the minutes of delay felt endless to those caught in the
terror of the fire and survivors have spoken angrily of what they
saw as a slow and even obstructive response.
	   ''No help. No police. No firemen,'' 17-year-old Zuhir Hersi, one
of the disc jockeys at the bash said Friday, hours after the blaze
exploded. ''Just kids helping kids.''
	   And once the squads arrived, the kids were then blocked from
helping, they say.
	   ''We could have saved more young people if only police hadn't
stopped us,'' Mohanned Hussein was quoted as saying by the
newspaper Expressen.
	   On Saturday, hundreds of people stood quietly outside the gutted
building amid flowers and candles as they attempted to come to
grips with catastrophe.
	   In the parking lot that a day before had been a tumult of
ambulances and screams, mourners had laid a 30-meter-long
(100-foot-long) pile of bouquets, candles and cards of remembrance.
	   The cards' inscriptions were brief _ ``I will see you in
heaven,'' ``We miss you'' _ and the people who stood reading them
also had few words.
	   ``I just wanted to show my sympathy. I think about them. There's
nothing else we can do,'' said Caroline Ericsson, who didn't know
any of the fire's victims.
	   For Lasse Gustavsson, having the right words wasn't as important
as showing his face, severely disfigured in a fire. The former
Goteborg firefighter lost his ears, his eyelids and most of his
nose in a gas explosion.
	   By showing up, he said, he wanted to show the victims' relatives
and friends that spirit can help them pull through despair.
	   ``I can't give them hope. Consolation is enough,'' he said, as
people nearby cast uneasy glances at his scars.
	   Many of those injured in the blaze may have to endure similar
shocked looks the rest of their lives. Authorities say the
explosive fire quickly raised the temperature in the overcrowded
hall to 600 degrees (1,100 F).
	   The cause of the fire that broke out just before midnight
Thursday remains under investigation. Witness accounts have varied
widely, with some reporting smoke coming from the building's cellar
and others saying the fire appeared to start in the ceiling of the
dance hall on the building's second floor.
	   The fire's quick spread has prompted speculation that it could
have been set, but officials also say the explosive spread could
have been because the fire had been burning undetected for some
time.
	   What's known is that the hall was packed far beyond its
capacity. Licensed to hold a maximum of 150, the hall held at least
250 and perhaps as many as 400 when the fire hit.
	   The crowd was mostly teen-agers and mostly immigrants or
children of immigrant parents. They had come for a disco dance
organized by eight party-arrangers whom police have not identified;
the hall was rented by the organizers from the local Macedonian
immigrant association.
	   Officials said the dead and injured were of 19 nationalities,
including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, as well
as people from the current and former Yugoslavia and unspecified
Latin American countries.
	   Identifying the dead was a wrackingly slow process, forcing
relatives and friends already exhausted with dread to wait for
hours at hospitals. Only 18 of the dead had been identified by
midday Saturday.
	   ``The identification is hard because they have no driver's
licenses or other documents _ they were so young,'' said Kerstin
Einarsson of Sahlgrenska Hospital, the largest in the city of
435,000 residents about 300 miles west of Stockholm.
	   The worst previous Swedish fire disaster in modern history was
in 1978 in Boraas, when 20 people died in a hotel fire.

Bahraini, Iraqi jailed for agitating against Bahrain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ An appeals court on Saturday convicted a Bahraini
and an Iraqi of fomenting trouble against the government of
neighboring Bahrain and sentenced them to three years in jail each.
	   Adel Jassem Hayki, the Bahraini, and Abdullah Younis
Abdul-Sayyed of Iraq were found guilty of distributing leaflets
calling for the forceful removal of Bahrain's ruling family, the
official Kuwait News Agency said.
	   Their case was take to the appeals court by prosecutors after a
a criminal court acquitted them in March.
	   It is a crime in Kuwait to campaign against friendly countries.
	   Hayki and Abdul-Sayyed can appeal to the higher Cassation Court.
	   Bahrain, a tiny Gulf island state, has been shaken by unrest
since December 1994 by Shiite militants pressing for political and
economic reform. The ruling family of Bahrain belongs to the
mainstream Sunni sect of Islam.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Gheorghe Funar, an ultranationalist
mayor known for his radical anti-Hungarian views, has joined the
party of another extremist leader, Corneliu Vadim Tudor, media
reported Saturday.
	   ``We have to leave apart other interests and stay together in
the fight for the national interests and for the country's
salvation,'' Funar told the Curentul daily.
	   He joined Friday the board of the Greater Romania Party, led by
Tudor, who is known for his anti-Semitism and snide remarks about
leading Romanian politicians.
	   Funar said he was not afraid to lose his political identity,
saying ``I'm convinced that we will make a formidable team.''
	   Funar mayor of Cluj, some 325 kilometers (203 miles) northwest
of Bucharest, in the region of Transylvania, where most of the
ethnic Hungarians live.
	   In the November 1996 parliamentary elections, the National Unity
Party with Funar at the helm barely won the three percent of the
vote necessary to enter parliament.
	   He was ousted last year from the party for ``severe deviations
from the party discipline.''
	   When Romania and Hungary signed a bilateral treaty in 1996,
signaling an end to decades of animosity, Funar organized a mock
burial ceremony.
	   He also ordered that park benches in Cluj be painted in the
colors of the Romanian tricolor flag.
	   Despite desperate attempts since 1996, Funar has been unable to
gather another support to set up another party.

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A British airman serving in Kuwait died in a car
crash that left two of his colleagues injured, the British Embassy
said Saturday.
	   The airmen were returning to the Ali Al-Salem Air Base Wednesday
evening when their four-wheel drive vehicle crashed, the embassy
said.
	   No other details were provided. The base is located some 70
kilometers (48 miles) northwest of Kuwait City.
	   An official at the embassy's defense section identified the
deceased as Senior Aircraftsman Brian Connel.
	   The official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the other
two servicemen were treated for ``minor injuries and were at work
now.''
	   More than 400 Royal Air Force servicemen are stationed in Kuwait
with a squadron of Tornado bombers under a defense pact to protect
the oil-rich emirate against Iraq.
	   Kuwait signed 10-year defense pacts with its Gulf War allies,
the United States, Britain, France and Russia, soon after the 1991
war that liberated it from a seven-month Iraqi occupation.

	   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) _ The chairman of South Korea's largest
conglomerate returned Saturday from a meeting with North Korean
leader Kim Jong Il with exclusive rights to develop a tourism
project in exchange for dlrs 906 million.
	   Kim approved other businesses ventures with longtime rival South
Korea, said Chung Ju-yung, 84, founder of the Hyundai group, and
the first known outsider to meet with Kim since he took absolute
power over North Korea in September.
	   Kim welcomed Hyundai's plan to send up to 2,000 tourists a week
on luxury cruise ships for tours of Diamond Mountain, a scenic
attraction on the North's east coast, Hyundai officials said.
	   In exchange for the right to develop Diamond Mountain with tax
exemptions, Hyundai agreed to pay North Korea dlrs 906 million over
the next six years in monthly payments, they said.
	   The sightseeing tour would be the largest inter-Korea joint
venture since the peninsula was divided into the communist North

	   Chung described the 56-year-old leader, whom he met at a

	   Other Hyundai-North Korea deals called for building a power
plant and gymnasium in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, as well
as a ship repair yard, and hotels, spas, golf courses and ski
slopes near Diamond Mountain.
	   North Korea and Hyundai also agreed to drill for oil on North
Korea's west coast and if successful, to lay an oil pipeline to

	   North Korea has already opened its remote northeast corner of
Rajin-Sonbong as a free economic zone. But some of Hyundai's
projects called for foreign investment in the isolated country's
heartland.
	   South Korea's chief presidential Park Jie-won called Chung's
meeting with Kim ``a very significant development'' but refused
further comment.
	   Experts have expressed reservations about Hyundai plans because
joint-venture projects between the two Koreas have always been
vulnerable to political and military tensions.
	   Still, Chung's extremely rare meeting with the North Korean
leader has set off a media sensation here.
	   Major TV stations interrupted their regular programming to carry
special reports on the meeting, and newspapers carried front-page
articles.
	   North Korean newspapers also carried front-page reports with
photos, the North's official Korean Central News Agency said.

Flowers and quiet tears as Swedes mourn teen-age fire victims

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ A panicky telephone call in poor Swedish
was the first word that authorities got of a fire racing through a
dance hall crowded with immigrant teen-agers, delaying fire squads'
response to the blaze that killed 60 and injured 162, officials
said Saturday.
	   Per-Olof Ortarsen of Goteborg's emergency services line said the
call was so hard to understand that it took three minutes for
workers to figure out what was going on and where to send fire
trucks.
	   The first fire trucks and rescue squads were on the scene six
minutes after the call was received, Ortarsen said at a news
conference. He and other officials declined to comment on whether a
quicker response could have saved any of the mostly immigrant
victims.
	   The minutes of delay felt endless to those caught in the terror
of the fire and survivors have spoken angrily of what they saw as a
slow and even obstructive response.
	   ''No help. No police. No firemen,'' 17-year-old Zuhir Hersi, one
of the disc jockeys at the bash, said Friday, hours after the blaze
exploded. ''Just kids helping kids.''
	   And once the squads arrived, the kids were blocked from helping,
they say.
	   ''We could have saved more young people if only police hadn't
stopped us,'' Mohanned Hussein was quoted as saying by the
newspaper Expressen.
	   On Saturday, hundreds of people stood quietly outside the gutted
building amid flowers and candles as they attempted to come to
grips with catastrophe.
	   In the parking lot that a day before had been a tumult of
ambulances and screams, mourners had laid a 30-meter-long
(100-foot-long) pile of bouquets, candles and cards of remembrance.
	   The cards' inscriptions were brief _ ``I will see you in
heaven,'' ``We miss you'' _ and the people who stood reading them
also had few words.
	   ``I just wanted to show my sympathy. I think about them. There's
nothing else we can do,'' said Caroline Ericsson, who didn't know
any of the victims.
	   For Lasse Gustavsson, having the right words wasn't as important
as showing his face, severely disfigured in a fire. The former
Goteborg firefighter lost his ears, his eyelids and most of his
nose in a gas explosion.
	   By showing up, he said, he wanted to show the victims' relatives
and friends that spirit can help them pull through despair.
	   ``I can't give them hope. Consolation is enough,'' he said, as
people nearby cast uneasy glances at his scars.
	   Many of those injured in the blaze may have to endure similar
shocked looks the rest of their lives. Authorities say the
explosive fire quickly raised the temperature in the overcrowded
hall to 600 degrees (1,100 F).
	   The cause of the fire that broke out just before midnight
Thursday remains under investigation. Witness accounts have varied
widely, with some reporting smoke coming from the cellar and others
saying the fire appeared to start in the ceiling of the dance hall
on the building's second floor.
	   The fire's quick spread has prompted speculation that it could
have been set, but officials also say the explosive spread could
have been because the fire had been burning undetected for some
time.
	   What's known is that the hall was packed far beyond its
capacity. Licensed to hold a maximum of 150, the hall held at least
250 and perhaps as many as 400 when the fire hit.
	   The crowd was mostly teen-agers and mostly immigrants or
children of immigrant parents. They had come for a dance organized
by eight party-arrangers whom police have not identified; the hall
was rented by the organizers from the local Macedonian immigrant
association.
	   Officials said the dead and injured were of 19 nationalities,
including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, as well
as people from the current and former Yugoslavia and unspecified
Latin American countries.
	   Identifying the dead was a wrackingly slow process, forcing
relatives and friends already exhausted with dread to wait for
hours at hospitals. Only 18 of the dead had been identified by
midday Saturday.
	   ``The identification is hard because they have no driver's
licenses or other documents _ they were so young,'' said Kerstin
Einarsson of Sahlgrenska Hospital, the largest in the city of
435,000 residents about 300 miles (500 kilometers) west of
Stockholm.
	   The worst previous Swedish fire disaster in modern history was
in 1978 in Boraas, when 20 people died in a hotel fire.

Stick-wielding Turkish Cypriot farmers confront British police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHEKELIA BASE, Cyprus (AP) _ Stick-wielding Turkish Cypriots
blocked Greek Cypriot farmers from reaching their fields on a
British sovereign base Saturday, chasing off both the farmers and
their British police protectors.
	   The incident developed as five farmers tried to reach 800 acres
(320 hectares) of fields owned by Greek Cypriots but farmed by
Turkish Cypriots since the 1974 Turkish invasion divided island
into separate ethnic areas.
	   It was the first time British officials provided protection to
the Greek Cypriots after the farmers had demanded it for years
since their fields are on a base that remained British territory
under Cyprus' 1960 independence from Britain.
	   The British police in riot gear made no attempt to disperse
about 100 Turkish Cypriots blocking the road leading to the Greek
Cypriot farmers' fields.
	   The fields were later reached through another dirt track. But
the three police cars in which the farmers were riding quickly
retreated when Turkish Cypriot farmers followed them.
	   ``The police escorted five farmers to their land ...
Unfortunately because of the threat of injury they couldn't stay
there very long,'' said British bases spokesman Bob Need.
	   Andonis Karas, lawyer for the Greek Cypriot farmers, said he
planned to go to the European Court to complain that the British
police failed to protect the rights of his clients.
	   ``The British government is responsible for everything within
its sovereign base and it has a duty to ensure the rights of the
Cypriots within the base territory are adequately protected,''
Karas said.
	   Cyprus has has been split into a Turkish-occupied north and a
Greek Cypriot-controlled south since the 1974 invasion, which was
sparked by an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Dhekelia is one of two British sovereign bases on the island.
Both bases include Cypriot villages and extensive land cultivated
by Cypriot owners.

Haiti doesn't have money to rebuild after Hurricane Georges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL NORTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haiti has only dlrs 23 million to
rebuild roads, bridges and irrigation canals destroyed by Hurricane
Georges, less than half of what is needed for just the hardest-hit
areas, the government says.
	   Even before the storm caused floods and mudslides that killed
221 people, Haiti, the poorest country in the Western hemisphere,
was a disaster zone. The U.N. Human Development Index ranked the
Caribbean nation No. 159 out of 174 countries in terms of income,
life expectancy and education level.
	   About 700 million gourdes (dlrs 43.8 million) is needed to
rebuild after the Sept. 23 hurricane, Finance and Economics
Minister Fred Joseph said at a news conference Friday. He said that
would cover only the worst-hit areas.
	   The United States has pledged 210 million gourdes (dlrs 13.1
million) and the Washington-based Inter-American Development Bank
132 million gourdes (dlrs 8.3 million) in emergency aid for
infrastructure. Haiti's cash-strapped government _ embroiled in a
political power struggle for 1 1/2 years that has stalled millions
of dollars in foreign aid _ can contribute only 25 million gourdes
(dlrs 1.6 million), Joseph said.
	   The U.N. Development Program donated dlrs 100,000 and Taiwan
dlrs 300,000. Canada, Germany, Japan, and Spain donated additional
hundreds of thousands of dollars. France, Haiti's former colonizer,
sent specialists to help purify water and treat the injured.
	   In addition, dozens of tons of material have been flown in from
private international sources to help hurricane victims.
	   In his estimate, Joseph did not even mention the cost of
rebuilding thousands of homes ripped apart by the storm and more
than 56,000 head of livestock killed.
	   Most Haitian deaths were blamed on flooding and mudslides in
rural, mountainous areas. A flash flood nearly destroyed the
southeastern border town of Fonds Verrettes, where 102 people died.
For generations, Haitian peasants have cut down trees to make
charcoal, denuding mountains left incapable of absorbing rainfall.
	   In economic terms, the hardest hit was the central Artibonite
Valley, which is Haiti's bread basket. Filled to overflowing by
torrential rainfall, the Lake Peligre hydroelectric dam there
threatened to burst. The floodgates were opened, and a terrestrial
tidal wave covered hundreds of thousands of acres (hectares) of
farmland.
	   Economists predict a sharp rise in the cost of living since rice
and beans, Haiti's staples, will have to be imported in greater
quantities.
	   Earlier this month, Joseph estimated agricultural damage alone
at more than dlrs 300 million.

Romanian-Russian talks on friendship pact again inconclusive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Another round of Romanian-Russian
talks on a bilateral friendship treaty has made now headway,
largely due to disputes dating back as far as World War I, Aurelian
Bistreanu, a Foreign Ministry official said Saturday.
	   He tried to put a positive spin on the continuing stalemate.
	   ``We cannot say it was a failure ... because each state has its
own right to promote the most adequate terms which express its
interests,'' Bistreanu said.
	   Bistreanu led Romanian officials who discussed in Bucharest
details of the pact with a Russian delegation Oct. 27-30.
	   Romanian-Russian relations have cooled over the past few years,
and there are no signs that the two governments will manage to sign
the document any time soon.
	   The treaty has been in preparation for several years.
	   In 1995, the two countries were ready to sign the treaty, but
the Romanians backed out at the last minute.
	   The Romanians are angry that the national treasure, which the
Romanian monarchy shipped to Moscow for safekeeping in 1917 during
World War I, has never been returned. It included gold, artefacts
and other valuables.
	   On the other hand, the Russians argue that Romania should pay
first for weapons received from Russia during the First World War.
	   Also, Russia wants some compensation for damage done by
Romanians who fought alongside Nazi troops during World War II when
Romania was first allied with Germany against the Soviet Union,
radio Contact reported.
	   Romania wants Russia to denounce the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop
Pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, which included a
secret agreement that enabled Moscow to seize lands then under
Romanian control.
	   The territory, taken by the Soviet Union in 1940, included
Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, parts of which are now state
territory of Moldova and Ukraine.
	   According to Bistreanu, the Russian negotiators said the
Romanian demand amounted to territorial pretensions.

Composer Paul Misraki dead at age 90
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Composer Paul Misraki, author of more than 160
cinema sound tracks and a major influence behind the growth of
swing in France, has died, his family said Saturday. He was 90.
	   Misraki, whose best known song was ``Tout va tres bien madame la
Marquise,'' died overnight Thursday after a long struggle against
illness.
	   Misraki was born in Constantinople _ modern day Istanbul _ but
spent most of his life in France. During the Nazi occupation he
moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina, and later worked for RKO Pictures
in Hollywood.
	   He began playing the piano aged four, and wrote his first piece,
a waltz called ``La Jolie,'' three years later.
	   In the 1930s he teamed up with musician Ray Ventura in France
where they would taste success with their brand of swing.
	   He moved into cinema in the 1940s, composing for Orson Wells,
Jacques Becker, Luis Bunuel and Jean-Luc Godard, among others.
	   Up until his death, Misraki continued to work, compiling a
compact disc of his most famous works which is due to be released
within weeks, his family said.
	   He wrote a dozen essays on spirituality, including
``L'experience de l'apres-vie'' (Experience of the After Life.)
	   Misraki is survived by his wife, and three children. There were
no immediate details of funeral arrangements.

	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ A land mine left over from Lebanon's civil
war exploded Saturday in a field in the south, injuring an
8-year-old girl whose leg had to be amputated, officials said.
	   Lamis Abou Daher was playing in a field outside her home in
Zaarouriyeh village outside the southern port city of Sidon when
the land mine went off, security officials said.
	   She was transported to the a hospital in Sidon where doctors
amputated her right leg from the knee, the officials said. They
spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   They said the land mine was believed to have been planted during
the days of the 1975-90 armed Lebanese conflict.
	   Two children were killed on May 20 when a land mine went off as
they played in a field near their village in eastern Lebanon.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The United States is to give Jordan a soft
loan of dlrs 70 million to help finance small businesses, the
state-run Petra News Agency reported Saturday.
	   The money will be allocated to some 35,000 Jordanian business
executives over the next four years to help them launch companies,
the agency said.
	   Petra said 50 percent of the executives will be women.
	   Government figures show that 97 percent of enterprises in Jordan
are small and medium-sized firms.
	   Petra did not give the terms of such loans.
	   Officials were not immediately available for comment.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan has agreed to allow the Palestinian
Authority to use the Red Sea port of Aqaba for imports, an
Agriculture Ministry official said Saturday.
	   It will be the first time that the authority will import goods
through Aqaba, Jordan's port 350 kilometers (210 miles) south of
Amman.
	   Hashem Shboul, the ministry's secretary-general, said the
agreement, which takes effect immediately, was reached in talks
with Palestinian officials on Thursday in Gaza.
	   Shboul said the Palestinians were mainly interested in importing
livestock and dairy imports through Aqaba.
	   He said the Palestinians would also import Jordanian dairy
products without paying duty.
	   ____
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The government has promised to take steps to
increase the liquidity on the Kuwait Stock Exchange, whose index
has tumbled to an almost two-year low, the Al-Anba daily reported
Saturday.
	   The pro-government newspaper quoted the Commerce Minister
Abdul-Aziz al-Dakheel as saying the Cabinet was going to discuss
Sunday ways of ``correcting the lack of liquidity and giving
investors more flexibility.'' He did not elaborate.
	   Al-Dakheel said he was optimistic the market would recover from
this ``temporary'' fall, which was partly attributed to the global
economic crisis and the instability of oil prices.
	   The exchange lists 76 companies and is considered one of the
most active in the Arab world. However, it is only open to Kuwaitis
and nationals of the five other Arab states in the Gulf: Saudi
Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman.
	   ____
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ The Bahrain-based investment bank,
Investcorp Bank E.C., said Saturday it has sold Simmons Co. _ a
manufacturer of bedding products in the United States _ to Fenway
Partners for approximately dlrs 500 million.
	   The bank said in a statement it expected Simmons to generate
about dlrs 590 million in revenue in fiscal 1998. Investcorp did
not reveal the value of the sale to Fenway Partners, a U.S.
investment fund, or when it was concluded.
	   Investcorp acquired Simmons in 1996 for dlrs 300 million.
	   Investcorp acts as a principal and intermediary in international
investment transactions.

Japan beats Hong Kong in Asian rugby, wins World Cup berth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Japan win, INCORPORATES Singapore-RugbyU-Asia

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Japan earned a place in the Rugby World Cup for
the fourth time with a 47-7 defeat of Hong Kong on Saturday, while
South Korea kept its hopes for a berth alive as second-place
finisher in the Asian Rugby Union Football Championships.
	   Japan, the only team to ever represent Asia in the Rugby World
Cup, scored seven tries to Hong Kong's one in the winner-take-all
final at Singapore's National Stadium.
	   South Korea revived its chance for a place in next year's World
Cup in Wales by defeating Taiwan 81-21 in an earlier match
Saturday.
	   South Korea had the game won in the first half when it ran in
eight tries, four of which were converted, against Taiwan's two
replies.
	   Japan's win made South Korea equal on points with Hong Kong and
Taiwan. But South Korea scored the most tries after its 13-try haul
against Taiwan, which scored seven tries in its three matches.
	   Hong Kong scored four in its first two matches for a total of
five.
	   The second-placed team in the Asian group qualifies for the
seven-team repechage tournament to be held early next year. Its
first knockout match will be against the third-placed team among
England, Italy and the Netherlands.
	   Also Saturday, the Asian Rugby Football Union ruled that a
misunderstanding on eligibility rules led to Thailand's refusal to
play against Singapore last weekend in a dispute that cast a shadow
over the tournament.
	   The union said no action was to be taken in the disagreement
over Singapore's fielding of four non-citizens.
	   The ruling was made as the union elected Jamie Scott of Hong
Kong as the new honorary secretary-general, replacing Decho
Sariputra of Thailand, who stepped down Monday to take
responsibility for the fiasco.
	   The council issued a vote of thanks for Decho's ``outstanding
work ... during his six years of office'' in the unpaid post.
	   Nine participating nations had voted before the tournament to
allow Singapore's mixed squad.
	   Thailand, Sri Lanka and Malaysia had voted against the move, but
it was believed they had acceded to the majority decision.
	   Thailand, however, insisted at game time on Oct. 24 it had not
agreed and refused to play.
	   Decho immediately banned the Thais from the championships, then
reinstated them the next day.
	   On Monday, Decho announced at an emotional news conference that
the controversy had embarrassed the tournament and that he would
not seek re-election to his post.
	   On Saturday, the Asian Rugby Football Union Council said, ``It
is agreed that there was a misunderstanding between Thai Rugby
Union and Singapore Rugby Union.''
	   Also elected Saturday were: Zen Shirai of Japan as president,
Adm Han Sakulpanich of Thailand as senior vice president, and Peter
Duncan of Hong Kong as junior vice president.

Sudan Universities reopen after students return from war zone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's 27 universities reopened Saturday
after a one-month break when some 20,000 male students went south
to fight alongside government troops in their war against rebel
forces.
	   At least 16 students from two universities were killed in the
fighting in the Eastern Equatoria province in the south, officials
said. No figures were available for the casualties from other
universities.
	   In the past week, Sudanese television had showed scores of
university students being treated in hospitals.
	   The government had closed the universities for a month to allow
students to volunteer to fight against Christian and animist
guerrillas seeking autonomy for the southern region. It said 20,000
men joined the fighting.
	   ``We have resumed studies today upon the return of all our
students from operation zones,'' Abdul-Malik Naeem, a University of
Khartoum spokesman, told The Associated Press.
	   The university vice-chancellor, Zubair Bashir Taha, said four of
the 340 volunteers from his university were killed and eight were
wounded.
	   The Omdurman Islamic University lost 12 students and 15 others
were wounded among the 267 students who went to the front.
	   The government said the rebels from the Sudan People's
Liberation Army were helped by Ugandan forces, a charge that Uganda
denied.

China bans unofficial anti-corruption group; dissident detained
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report of dissident detained while trying to
leave country; EDITS to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Maintaining its tight restraints on unofficial
political activities, the government has banned a private group set
up by dissidents to combat corruption, a human rights group said
Saturday.
	   The group also reported that border police detained a prominent
intellectual when he attempted to leave the country Saturday
evening.
	   Peng Ming, a founding member of the China Development Union, an
independent association of intellectuals, had been invited to visit
Harvard University and planned to visit Hong Kong en route to the
United States, according to the Information Center of Human Rights
and Democratic Movement in China.
	   On Monday, Beijing police ordered the disbanding of the China
Development Union, searched its offices and confiscated a fax
machine, computer and documents.
	   They questioned Peng and two other organizers of the group and
told them the group's activities were illegal because it was not
registered with the government.
	   China requires all organizations to register with the
authorities and in most cases applications are turned down, foiling
efforts by dissidents to promote reforms through independent, legal
channels.
	   The Hong Kong-based Information Center also reported that
dissidents associated with the unofficial group Corruption Watch,
founded in September by nine activists in seven provinces, had been
detained and interrogated by police over the past few days,
	   Police in Xinyang, in central China's Henan province, told
dissident An Jun, a founding member of Corruption Watch, Friday
that the group had been deemed illegal, the Information Center
said.
	   The authorities said the group was not needed because the
government already had agencies working to fight corruption.
	   Meanwhile, a group of 51 people issued a letter of protest
against a government decision to freeze funds collected by Chinese
students in Germany to help victims of the 1989 military
suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations, Human Rights in China
said Saturday.
	   The letter demanded the government release the money, saying
they would take legal action against ``robbery'' of the funds, the
New York-based group said.
	   The protest followed reports earlier this week that bank
officials in Wuxi, in eastern China's Jiangsu province, had refused
to cash a check worth 11,620 German marks (dlrs 7,000) that had
been entrusted to Ding Zilin, the mother of a victim.
	   Bank officials told Ding, a retired professor whose 17-year-old
son died in the 1989 crackdown, that the money was frozen for six
months on orders from the State Security Bureau.
	   Ding has led efforts by families of victims to ask the
government to re-examine the June 4, 1989, assault on demonstrators
and account for the hundreds, possibly thousands, killed in the
crackdown.

Pakistani cricketers deny match fixing charges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MUNIR AHMED &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Three of Pakistan's top cricket players
denied taking money to throw matches when they appeared Saturday
before a judicial inquiry into allegations of match fixing.
	   Leading batsmen Saeed Anwar and Inzamamul Haq and spin bowler
Mushtaq Ahmed told the inquiry that they had no links with
bookmakers.
	   A judicial inquiry is being held into accusations that senior
Pakistani cricketers, including two former captains, Wasim Akram
and Saleem Malik, fixed matches. The accusations were leveled by
some of their team mates and Australian cricketers.
	   They have denied the charge.
	   Anwar said he received two telephone calls from bookmakers who
offered him bribes to play poorly during Pakistan's tour of Sri
Lanka in 1994.
	   ``I refused the offer and reported it to the officials of the
cricket board,'' he said. He also said the bookmakers warned him
against disclosing the offer.
	   Anwar said he also heard rumors that some cricket players had
links with bookmakers, but he had no information on that. He also
said Malik did not offer him a bribe.
	   Ahmed, who denied being involved in match fixing, was warned by
the judge: ``If you lie, your career will end.''
	   Haq contradicted earlier testimony by team manager Intikhab Alam
that he had the players swear on the Koran _ the Muslim holy book _
that they would not throw the matches during a foreign tour.
	   The judge ordered Haq to return to give more testimony on Nov.
11.
	   Earlier this month Australian captain Mark Taylor and Mark Waugh
appeared before the tribunal to record their statements.
	   Waugh told the court he was offered thousands of dollars by
Malik which he turned down.

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Australia stunned defending champions
Germany 2-0 Saturday in its first match of the 20th Champions
Trophy men's field hockey tournament.
	   Germany, which has won the trophy for a record seven times, has
brought in a young side in order to prepare for the 2000 Sydney
Olympics. Without experienced Oliver Domke and Christoph Bechmann,
the Germans never threatened.
	   Jay Stacy led Australia, which won the Commonwealth Games title
in Kuala Lumpur last month. The Australians dominated the Germans
for most of the time and finally broke the ice through Lachlan
Vivian Taylor in the 32nd minute.
	   Taylor grabbed an opportunity from a rebound after Ben Taylor's
hard drive was saved by German keeper and captain Christopher
Reitz. Ben Taylor minutes earlier had missed an open scoring chance
when he had only Reitz to beat.
	   Going 1-0 into the second half, the Australians always had an
edge as Germany's forwards failed to make any significant move.
Adam Commens then sealed the fate with his 41st goal as he pushed
the ball into the net after a fine effort from left flank.
	   Result: Australia 2 (Lachlan Vivian Taylor (32nd minute), Adam
Commens (41st minute); Germany 0.
	   Teams: Australia: Jay Stacy (captain), Adam Commens, Jason Duff,
Troy Elder, James Elmer, Lachlan Dreher, Ben Taylor, Daniel
Sproule, Lachlan Vivian-Taylor, Mark Hickman, Scott Webster,
Stephen Holt, Matthew Wells, Murray Richards, Brent Livermore, Dean
Butler.

Klink, Benjamin Kopp, Christian Kurtz, Andreas Lante, Christian
Mayerhofer, Bjorn Michel, Ulrich Moissl, Sascha Reinelt, Christian

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ World Cup and Olympic title holders
Holland defeated Spain 3-2 in the opening match of the Champions
Trophy field hockey tournament in Lahore on Saturday.
	   Two strikes from Bram Lomans and a goal from Jacques Brinkman
gave Holland a 3-0 lead. However, Spain, runners-up in the World
Cup at Utrecht, Holland, struck back late in the second half with
Juan Escarre and captain Victor Pujol's controversial goal.
	   Malaysian umpire Surjeet Singh awarded Spain the second goal off
Pujol, although the Dutch players were convinced that the ball had
gone in the goal off their own defender's stick. But Singh upheld
his decision as Holland captain and goalkeeper Ronald Janssen
strongly protested the decision.
	   A defense minded approach from Spain allowed the Netherlands to
strike twice in the first half. Lomans' strong push from his team's
fifth penalty corner in the 21st minute helped his team to move
ahead.
	   Brinkmann then doubled the lead off a rebound when he slotted
home off a 29th minute short corner as Holland led 2-0.
	   Spain forced six short corners in the second half to put
pressure on Holland. However, they could not convert any of them
into a goal. The Netherlands shot 3-0 up when defender Lomans
strong flick in the 44th minute left goalkeeper Ramon Jufresa
stranded.
	   With time running out for Spain, it struck twice in three
minutes late in the second half. Escarre was on target off the 65th
minute penalty stroke after striker Pablo Amat was brought down in
the striking circle.
	   Pujol's goal gave Spain a glimmer of hope, but Holland, looking
for the third title in its World Cup and Olympics crowns, managed
to hold onto its 3-2 lead.
	   Result: Holland 3 (Bram Lomans (21st min, 44th min), Jacques
Brinkman (29th min); Spain 2 (Juan Escarre (65th min), Victor Pujol
(68th min).
	   Teams: Holland: Ronald Janssen (captain, goalkeeper), Bram
Lomans, Danny Bree, Erik Jazet, Tycho van Meer, Peter Windi, Sander
van der Weide, Jacques Brinkman, Piet Hein Geeris, Marten
Eikelboom, Sander van Heeswijk, Jeroen Delmee, Guus Vogels, Teunde
Nooijer, Remco van Wijk, Jaap Derk Buma.
	   Spain: Ramon Jufresa (goalkeeper), Xavier Ribas, Francisco
Fabregas, Juan Escarre, Victor Pujol (captain), Pablo Amat, Jordi
Casas, Javier Arnau, Ramon Sala, Josep Sanchez, Pablo Usoz,

Airlines seeking damages for Milan airport chaos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ After days of baggage gone astray and
flights diverted elsewhere, foreign airlines intend to join
Alitalia in seeking damages for the chaos at Malpensa 2000 airport,
Milan's newly revamped international hub.
	   Italian newspapers on Saturday quoted Osvaldo Gammino, head of a
committee representing the airlines' interests, as saying that a
meeting would be held on Tuesday to help come up with an exact
figure.
	   The debut on Oct. 25 of Malpensa was plagued with problems, many
of them blamed on a badly-working communications systems.
	   Flights were often several hours late or sometimes diverted to
other airports in northern Italy. There weren't enough parking
places for planes nor shuttle buses to transport travelers from
boarding gates to the aircraft.
	   Gammino said the airlines were considering asking the company,
Sea, which runs the airport, 250,000 lire (about dlrs 150) for
every suitcase delivered to passengers a day late.
	   The new airport drew complaints even before it opened because it
is so much farther from Milan than the city's other airport,
Linate, which was heavily used by the Milan-Rome shuttle and other
domestic routes as well as for short-haul flights in Europe.
	   A rail link between the metropolis and Malpensa won't be ready
for more than a year, and a taxi ride from Milan to the airport
costs at least dlrs 65, much more in case of heavy traffic.
	   After businessmen and others complained about landing in
Malpensa, several routes linking Milan with Sicily and other
southern points were rerouted to fly out of Linate again starting
in November.

	   VALLADOLID, Spain (AP) _ The latest social drama by British
director Ken Loach won the Golden Ear of Corn award Saturday at the
Valladolid film festival.
	   ``My name is Joe'' focuses on the love affair between a
recovering alcoholic and a social worker in a rundown neighborhood
of Glasgow.
	   The decision by the jury of the 43rd edition of the film
festival in this northern Spanish city was applauded by the
audience.
	   Briton Peter Mullan, who plays Joe in Loach's film, received the
festival's award for best actor, while Spain's Adriadna Gil was
voted best actress for her role in the Spanish film, ``Black
tears''.
	   The jury's special prize was given to Heather Rose. Rose, a
sufferer of cerebral palsy, both wrote and acted in a film base on
her life titled ``Dance Me to My Song'' directed by Australian Rolf
de Heer.
	   The award for best new director was jointly awarded to British
director Shane Meadows, for ``24.7,'' and Frenchman Christophe
Ruggia for ``Chaaba's Son.''
	   Meadow's film also won the best photography prize.

Report: Welteke to be new Bundesbank president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Ernst Welteke, the head of the central bank
in Hesse state, will be named to replace German central bank chief
Hans Tietmeyer next year, Der Spiegel newsmagazine reported
Saturday.
	   The Finance Ministry labeled the report ``pure speculation'' and
said the decision had not yet been made.
	   But Spiegel said the new finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine,
wants Welteke, a fellow Social Democrat, in the post as his
advocate for more flexibility in setting monetary policy.
	   Welteke, 56, is considered less of an anti-inflation hardliner
when it comes to setting interest rates than Tietmeyer, who will
retire next year when he turns 68.
	   Lafontaine has advocated interest rate cuts to spur the economy,
but his calls have so far been ignored by the fiercely independent
central bank.
	   The Bundesbank cedes power next year to the new European Central
Bank, which will set monetary policy for all European Union
countries joining monetary union on Jan. 1.
	   Welteke would then be one of two German representatives with the
European bank, the other being director Otmar Issig, who favors a
strict anti-inflationary approach to monetary policy.
	   Lafontaine also wants to sit in on the Bundesbank's council
meeting Thursday in Frankfurt. ``Naturally I invited him,'' the
magazine quoted current Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer as
saying.

Sharif launches crackdown on former ally, 100 arrested

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Security forces swept through troubled
neighborhoods of Karachi on Saturday arresting about 100 activists
of a minority ethnic party, following the dismissal a day earlier
of the Sindh provincial government and the imposition of federal
rule.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said relentless violence between
feuding factions of the Muttaheda Qami Movement, a former ally of
his in the Sindh government, prompted the dismissal.
	   It was followed by a massive crackdown.
	   Police and paramilitary rangers conducted dozens of raids before
dawn on Saturday on MQM strongholds throughout the city. Sharif
accused the MQM of harboring the killers of prominent
philanthropist Hakim Said, who was shot at his clinic in Karachi
last week.
	   Earlier, Sharif warned the MQM to hand over Said's killers. The
MQM balked at Sharif's warning and accusations that their party was
involved in terrorism.
	   The standoff between Sharif and the MQM ended Friday when Sharif
went on television and announced that the Sindh provincial
government was dismissed and the federal government would run the
province through the governor, retired Gen. Moinuddin Haider.
	   Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League did not have a majority in Sindh
to form a government without the MQM, the majority partner in the
provincial coalition government.
	   The MQM says it is fighting for the political and economic
rights of Indian Muslims who migrated from India after independence
from Britain in 1947.
	   In his speech, Sharif promised a sweeping crackdown on MQM
activists in both factions of the divided movement. The movement
split several years ago and the two factions routinely clash to
gain control of each other's areas.
	   Their relentless war for control of Karachi has left 1,000
people dead this year and, according to Sharif, prompted the
decision to impose federal rule.
	   Entire neighborhoods in Karachi have become battlegrounds.
Police in riot gear and Rangers in armored personnel carriers
patrol some of the hardest hit areas.
	   The announcement of federal rule was quickly followed by dozens
of arrests, according to MQM workers in Karachi.
	   ``At least 100 of our workers have been arrested so far. All our
elected representatives are sitting at the party headquarters and
waiting for their arrest,'' MQM spokesman Shoaib Bukhari said.
	   Information Minister Mushahid Hussain said the government was
not targeting the MQM, but ``all those people involved in crime and
terrorism, regardless of their political affiliations.''
	   He said Sharif dismissed the Sindh government after it was
established that MQM members were involved in Said's slaying.
	   Security forces were put on alert soon after the dismissal of
the Sindh government. They searched vehicles for weapons and
patrolled in armored vehicles mounted with machine guns. The number
of police checkpoints has also increased.
	   ``We are used to of arrests, raids and killings of our
workers,'' said Farooq Sattar, a leader of the MQM. ``Our morale is
high and we will continue our struggle for the rights of our
people.''

Religious students, teachers offer reward for killing Rushdie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Thousands of Iranian clerics and theological
students have pledged a month's salary toward a bounty for the
killing of British author Salman Rushdie, an Iranian newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   The pledge shows the continuing division over Rushdie, who was
condemned to death in 1989 after the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the founding spiritual leader of the Islamic republic,
ruled that his book ``The Satanic Verses'' was blasphemous.
	   In September, Britain restored full diplomatic relations with
Iran after Tehran distanced itself from the bounty. But the move
has been fiercely opposed by hard-line critics of the government of
President Mohammad Khatami, a political moderate.
	   In a pledge sent to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, students and teachers in the holy city of Qom, northwest
Iran, said they were ``ready to carry out the edict against Salman
Rushdie,'' the newspaper Kayhan reported.
	   ``Thousands have also signed up to give a month's wages to any
person who carries out the historical edict against Salman
Rushdie,'' the Farsi-language newspaper added.
	   Seminary students in Qom receive monthly stipends of about
200,000 rials (dlrs 66) and teachers earn about 300,000 rials (dlrs
100).
	   Last month a semi-government foundation in Iran raised the
bounty on Rushdie's head from dlrs 2.5 million to dlrs 2.8 million.
The move followed the government's distancing itself from the
reward.
	   Last month residents of a north Iranian village offered land and
carpets to anyone who kills Rushdie.

New government makes a vigorous start
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREA LORINCZOVA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ A day after being sworn in, the new
Slovak coalition government quickly launched into action Saturday,
preparing legislation to reform the media and rescheduling
municipal elections.
	   The four-party coalition, headed by 43-year-old Prime Minister
Mikulas Dzurinda, holds 93 of the 150 seats in parliament _ a
comfortable majority to adopt key legislation, including amendments
to the constitution.
	   Dzurinda replaced authoritarian Vladimir Meciar, who resigned
after losing a governing majority in parliament in nationwide
balloting Sept. 25-26. He hopes that his country will soon join the
ranks of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland who are among
candidates to join the Eurpean Union and NATO.
	   The new government immediately rescheduled municipal elections,
originally set for Nov. 13-14, to take place Dec. 19. The delay
gives the government a chance to have parliament change the
election law ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, which
said it discriminates against ethnic Hungarian voters.
	   Moving fast to enact key reforms to improve Slovakia's democracy
record, the Cabinet agreed on a draft law to revamp the broadcast
media, redefining the responsibilities of the radio and television
councils which are supposed to supervise programming.
	   Under Meciar, state-run television aired mostly his opinions and
those of his government and often vilified the then opposition,
drawing sharp criticism for being biased even during the election
campaign.
	   TV director Igor Kubis warned of massive lay-offs when the new
government is in power. Dzurinda denied this Saturday but said he
wants to have ``professional, morally intact people in high
positions.''
	   Declaring that state television was abused for Meciar's
political purposes, the new prime minister said, ``I do not want to
participate in brainwashing of people's minds.''
	   The next government session will be on Tuesday. Dzurinda hopes
to introduce the government program in parliament in three weeks.

	   MALAGA, Spain (AP) _ A drunken man who attacked an air hostess
with a bottle of vodka on a British charter flight to Spain
appeared before a Spanish magistrate on Saturday, news reports
said.
	   Fiona Weir, 31, received cuts in the head, back and arms when
British passenger Steven Handy attacked her early Friday at the end
of the three-hour Air Tours flight between London's Gatwick Airport
and Malaga in southern Spain, the Spanish news agency EFE reported.
	   Handy, 30, from Devon in southern England, was behaving in a
rowdy way throughout the flight. He was arrested during the
incident that also resulted in minor injuries for a local police
officer.
	   Weir was released from the clinic where she was treated later
Friday, a hospital spokeswoman said. She required 40 stitches, EFE
reported.

<TEXT>
	   SUZUKA, Japan (AP) _ Leading in Saturday's qualifying, Michael
Schumacher could well be on his way to his third Formula One
championship.
	   But what really counts, he said, is Sunday's Japanese Grand
Prix, the season-ending race that will determine the title.
	   ``This is only qualifying today so we must not get too excited
about it,'' Schumacher said. ``Instead, we must concentrate on
tomorrow's race.''
	   Schumacher, now four points behind McLaren's Mika Hakkinen,
gained the pole position. Hakkinen grabbed the second spot in the
front row.
	   Even if Schumacher wins Sunday, Hakkinen need only come in
second for the title, his first ever. Hakkinen's teammate, Briton
David Coulthard, took the third in qualifying.
	   ``Being second is not such a big problem,'' said the 30-year-old
Finn. ``Of course I would prefer to be on pole but it doesn't give
me any more pressure not to be.''
	   Schumacher said it was also heartening that his British Ferrari
teammate Eddie Irvine won fourth position.
	   ``Having Eddie on the second row, not too far behind is
encouraging,'' he said.
	   But clearly, the German would have preferred Irvine to have
fared better.
	   ``He had a problem with the car today and should go better
tomorrow and may be in a position to get past Mika,'' Schumacher,
29, said.
	   Schumacher clocked a lap of 1 minute 36.293 seconds on the
5.864-kilometer (3.643-mile) Suzuka Circuit. Hakkinen posted
1:36.471.
	   What could be key Sunday for both Schumacher and Hakkinen are
efforts by teammates Coulthard and Irvine.
	   Earlier this season, FIA, the international governing body of
automobile sports, clarified that ``driver arrangements within a
team are acceptable,'' meaning that Coulthard and Irvine can
legitimately help them out.
	   Last year at Suzuka, Schumacher got exactly such help from
Irvine and won the Japanese Grand Prix, the 1997 season's
penultimate race.
	   Schumacher had the second best position behind Jacques
Villeneuve, and Irvine started from the second row's inside
position.
	   Also at stake Sunday is the constructor's title, although
McLaren's wide lead will make it all but impossible for Ferrari to
catch up. It would be McLaren's eighth or Ferrari's ninth.

Catholic man slain as Northern Ireland misses key peace deadline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's rival
politicians missed the first key deadline of their peace agreement
on Saturday, a day marked by the killing of a Catholic man as he
walked home alone near a Protestant area of Belfast.
	   Brian Service, a van driver in his mid-30s, was shot twice in
the back of the head and three times in the back. No group claimed
responsibility, but local Catholic residents and politicians blamed
pro-British extremists from nearby Protestant turf.
	   The killing coincided with the first missed deadline specified
in April's peace accord. It envisaged that a new Northern Ireland
government of Protestants and Catholics would hold an inaugural
summit with the Irish Republic's government by the end of October.
	   But that symbolic new start to all-Ireland cooperation has been
delayed indefinitely because Northern Ireland's British Protestant
and Irish Catholic blocs can't agree on the terms for forming their
own multi-party government.
	   Protestant politician David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist Party
leader who in July was elected to lead the new government, is
refusing to include Sinn Fein members in a Cabinet-style
administration, which could have up to 12 posts.
	   Trimble, who this month shared the Nobel Peace Prize with
Catholic pacifist politician John Hume, insists that Sinn Fein
won't be eligible to participate unless the party's Irish
Republican Army allies start disarming first.
	   About 50 Sinn Fein activists, among them former IRA prison
commander Bik McFarlane, protested at midday outside the Ulster
Unionist headquarters in downtown Belfast. Most carried placards
with such slogans as ``David Trimble _ First Minister or Last
Minister?'' and ``Implement the Agreement Now.''
	   However, in a sign of how much political tolerances have been
changing, the mild Sinn Fein protest drew only a token police
presence and no heckling from the nearby hard-line Protestant Sandy
Row neighborhood. Until 1994, British authorities barred all Sinn
Fein rallies from downtown Belfast.
	   In the Irish Republic's capital of Dublin 100 miles (160 kms) to
the south, Sinn Fein's executive committee debated strategy in an
atmosphere of growing frustration.
	   Party chairman Mitchel McLaughlin said Trimble and others
demanding IRA disarmament now were ``taking enormous risks with all
of our expectations for a peaceful and democratic future.''
	   But a senior Ulster Unionist strategist, Reg Empey, accused Sinn
Fein of trying to use the IRA's hidden arsenal to ``hold the whole
country to ransom.''
	   ``The agreement, if it is to work, has to be exclusively
democratically based,'' Empey said, adding: ``The more they try to
use these weapons for bargaining power, the less we believe they're
prepared to use exclusively peaceful means.''

Jordan's prime minister meets Arafat over Mideast accord

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Jordan's prime minister met with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Saturday to discuss the latest
Mideast peace accord and called on Israel to carry out its side of
the deal.
	   On his first trip to the Palestinian Autonomy since taking
office in August, Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh held two hours of
talks with President Arafat in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
	   ``We will constantly coordinate on all issues that will help
implementation,'' said Tarawneh. He called on Israel to do the
same.
	   Jordan's King Hussein was instrumental in arranging the latest
peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians signed last week in
Washington.
	   Shuttling to the Mideast summit outside of Washington twice from
cancer treatment in Rochester, Minnesota, the king has been hailed
for his assistance in bridging the gaps between the two former
adversaries.
	   The deal calls on the Palestinian Authority to crackdown on
militant groups operating within its territories.
	   Khaled Maashal, a senior figure in the militant Palestinian
group Hamas lives in Jordan and Israel has often said orders for
terror attacks on Israeli civilians come from there.
	   Asked whether Jordan plans to take similar measures against the
Hamas stationed in its country, Tarawneh said ``Hamas has no
leadership, no representation and no bases in Jordan.''
	   Tarawneh was accompanied by senior economic aides, including
Trade, Industry and Supply Minister Mohammed Saleh Hourani, State
Minister for Development Taher Kanaan, Information Minister Nasser
Judeh and Foreign Minister Abdul-Illah Khatib.
	   In addition to Mideast peace, the two leaders discussed economic
cooperation and ways to overcome trade barriers due to Israeli
control of the borders between the Palestinian territories and
Jordan.

Krajicek upsets Sampras to reach final

 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Richard Krajicek, one of the few
players to have a winning record against Pete Sampras, upset the
No. 1 again Saturday to reach the final of the dlrs 2.45 million
dollars Eurocard Open.
	   Krajicek used his overpowering serve to beat Sampras 6-7 (2-7),
6-4, 7-6 (7-2) and bolster his chances of qualifying for the
season-ending World Championship next month in Hanover, Germany.
	   ``You have to play on the limit against Pete and hope he makes
one or two mistakes,'' Krajicek said.
	   Krajicek, ranked No. 11 in the world, improved his record
against Sampras to 5-2 and has won the last three encounters.
	   Wimbledon champion in 1996, Krajicek also has a good record in
Stuttgart: he won the title in 1995 and has reached his second
consecutive final.
	   Sampras is assured of keeping his top ranking at least through
next week's Paris indoor tournament and the battle for No. 1 is
unlikely to be settled until Hanover.
	   But the loss could make it more difficult for Sampras to become
the first player to finish as No. 1 for six years in a row.
	   ``It's a tough one to take at this point. I'll have to try to
regroup,'' Sampras said. ``he seems to play with no fear against
me.''
	   Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion, saved a set point in the
opening set with a couple of good serves and Sampras then fought
off two break points to force a tiebreaker. A cross-court forehand
winner gave him the set.
	   Sampras saved two set points in the second, hitting an ace on
one of them. Going for a big second serve, he hit it just a bit
long for his third double-fault if the game to give Krajicek the
second set.
	   ``I was going for big second serves the entire match and I
pushed some long,'' Sampras said. ``I got tight.''
	   The American had another double-fault in the decisive tiebreaker
to fall down 4-2 and he never recovered.
	   Krajicek hit an ace to gain three match points. Sampras saved
the first two with service winners but the Dutchman clinched the
match with a volley on the next.
	   ``It's very frustrating, I felt I was playing very well this
week and had a chance to win this tournament,'' said Sampras,
winner of 11 Grand Slam titles, one short of Roy Emerson's record.
	   ``The key was how well I returned his second serve and I wasn't
good enough, I didn't put enough pressure,'' Sampras said. ``He is
very devastating.''
	   Although Sampras had one more ace than Krajicek, 17-16, Krajicek
won 91 percent of his first-serve points, compared to 80 percent
for Sampras.

State government pact brings east German ex-communists back into
</HEADLINE>
power &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SCHWERIN, Germany (AP) _ The left-leaning Social Democrats in an
eastern German state approved a coalition pact Saturday after heavy
debate about bringing the former communists back into power for the
first time since German unification in 1990.
	   The Social Democrats in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania voted
63-22 with six abstentions to form a government with the Party for
Democratic Socialism, successor to East Germany's communist party,
as junior partner.
	   At their own party meeting, the PDS also approved the deal
Saturday by a vote of 100-6.
	   The pact is to be officially signed Monday and Social Democrat
Harald Ringstorff will be formally voted in as governor in the
state parliament Tuesday.
	   Most of the criticism of the deal came from Social Democrats
warning against returning former functionaries of East Germany's
oppressive communist regime to positions of power and influence in
state politics. The PDS is to get three of eight Cabinet posts in
the state government.
	   Some Social Democrats also complained that the deal scraps the
rule for background checks of public officials for past ties with
the Stasi, former East Germany's dreaded secret police.
	   Although the PDS garners about 20 percent of the vote in the
east, it has been treated as a political pariah in western Germany
because of its past.
	   Social Democratic leaders have ruled out working with the PDS at
the federal level, but have increasingly favored forcing the
ex-communists to shoulder responsibility in the struggling eastern
states.
	   However, in an open letter to be published next week's Der
Spiegel newsmagazine, four prominent Social Democrats warned that
cooperation with the PDS may end up backfiring.
	   ``The broad majority of east Germans are keeping their distance
from the PDS,'' the authors wrote, adding that granting the PDS
greater legitimacy could end up draining left-wing votes from the
Social Democratic party itself.
	   The Social Democrats have governed in another eastern German
state, Saxony-Anhalt, since 1994 with the tacit support of the PDS,
but the ex-communists have never officially been part of a
coalition government.

Religious students, teachers offer reward for killing Rushdie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Thousands of Iranian clerics and theological
students have pledged a month's salary toward a bounty for the
killing of British author Salman Rushdie, an Iranian newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   The pledge shows the continuing division over Rushdie, who was
condemned to death in 1989 after the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the founding spiritual leader of the Islamic republic,
ruled that his book ``The Satanic Verses'' was blasphemous.
	   In September, Britain restored full diplomatic relations with
Iran after Tehran distanced itself from the bounty. But the move
has been fiercely opposed by hard-line critics of the government of
President Mohammad Khatami, a political moderate.
	   In a pledge sent to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, students and teachers in the holy city of Qom, in
northwestern Iran, said they were ``ready to carry out the edict
against Salman Rushdie,'' the newspaper Kayhan reported.
	   ``Thousands have also signed up to give a month's wages to any
person who carries out the historical edict against Salman
Rushdie,'' the Farsi-language newspaper added.
	   Seminary students in Qom receive monthly stipends of about
200,000 rials (dlrs 66) and teachers earn about 300,000 rials (dlrs
100).
	   Last month a semi-government foundation in Iran raised the
bounty on Rushdie's head from dlrs 2.5 million to dlrs 2.8 million.
The move followed the government's distancing itself from the
reward.
	   Last month residents of a northern Iranian village offered land
and carpets to anyone who kills Rushdie.

Security forces arrest 28 Muslim Brotherhood members
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Security forces have arrested 28 suspected
members of Egypt's largest Muslim fundamentalist group on grounds
they were trying to instigate a revolution, police said Sunday.
	   The men, believed to belong to the Muslim Brotherhood, were
detained in five provinces that included Cairo and the port city of
Alexandria, the officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity. Police did not say when the arrests were made.
	   The arrests are the latest in a crackdown on the Muslim
Brotherhood that began in 1995 and has largely silenced the group.
	   Although banned, the Brotherhood was long tolerated by the
government, allowing it to recruit a large following and wield
substantial influence in Egypt's political and social life.
	   The government then accused it of supporting Muslim militants
who have staged a campaign of violence against the state in their
bid to install a strict Islamic state. The Brotherhood advocates an
Islamic state but denies that it supports the use of violence.
	   The suspects, who included doctors and students, had been
holding secret meetings in the impoverished Cairo district of
el-Sayeda Aisha to discuss ways to spread the Brotherhood's
influence to other provinces in an effort to ``stage a
revolution,'' police said.
	   The group faces charges that include joining an illegitimate
group bent on violating the constitution and stopping authorities
from performing their duties, charges which can carry up to 25
years at hard labor.

HJK Helsinki wins cup, qualifies for European play
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Tall defender Hannu Tihinen headed the
winning goal from a corner kick at 87 minutes as HJK Helsinki edged
PK-35 of Helsinki 3-2 Saturday to win the Finnish Cup final.
	   For HJK, which currently plays in the Champions' League, a place
in European soccer next season was at stake, as the team finished
outside the top three in the league. HJK now qualified for the Cup
winners' tournament.
	   HJK scored all three goals from set pieces. Aki Riihilahti
headed HJK into the lead at 17 minutes from a free kick by
Brazilian Piracaia. Mika Lehkosuo made it 2-1 from the penalty spot
at 54 minutes after giant striker Mika Kottila was downed.
	   PK-35, a newcomer which placed third ahead of HJK in the league,
finished with a two-man disadvantage after Rami Rantanen and Pasi
Pihamaa were ejected at 66 and 69 minutes. The team had equalized
twice, through Pihamaa at 50 minutes, and Janne Suokonautio at 57
minutes.
	   Haka of Valkeakoski won the Finnish championship and goes to
qualify for the Champions League nest year. VPS Vaasa was the
runnerup and also secured a place in European club soccer next
season.

New Holocaust-related lawsuit filed against German banks

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ German banks have been hit by a new
lawsuit filed in New York on behalf of Holocaust victims, and a
German newspaper reported Saturday that the action has the backing
of a major Jewish organization.
	   The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn by attorney Mel Weiss against Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank,
Dresdner Bank and others.
	   The Welt am Sonntag newspaper said Weiss' action is backed by
the World Jewish Congress, unlike a similar lawsuit filed in
Manhattan in June by another lawyer acting independently.
	   Reached in New York Saturday, WJC executive director Elan
Steinberg confirmed Weiss had filed a new lawsuit, but declined to
comment on whether either one had WJC backing.
	   The WJC was involved in reaching a dlrs 1.25 billion settlement
this year with Swiss banks for compensation to Holocaust survivors
and heirs.
	   Weiss did not return a message left on his office answering
machine.

Police ring world's tallest building to fend off demonstrators

 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with nearly 1,000 demonstrators at
mosque; tourism minister says tourism down by 80 percent. No
pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Hundreds of police reserves
carrying automatic rifles circled the world's tallest building
Saturday, bracing for another round of anti-government protests in
Malaysia.
	   Some 1,000 people gathered after prayers at a mosque in the
Kampong Baru neighborhood of Kuala Lumpur for a protest in which
they shouted slogans against the government. They waved pictures of
jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim and slapped ''reformasi'' stickers
on passing cars.
	   Plainclothes police looked on, but no riot police were in sight.
	   Few protesters turned up until late evening at the other places
in the main business district where anti-government campaigners had
called for large gatherings.
	   It was not clear whether protesters were deterred by last
weekend's violence or Saturday's heavy police presence and threats
of arrests.
	   A full-scale riot broke out for the first time in nearly three
decades on Oct. 24, after riot police fired tear gas and water
cannons at the same neighborhood mosque. Protesters at the Muslim
house of prayer retaliated by hurling stones and bricks.
	   In recent gatherings, thousands of usually docile Malaysians
have flocked downtown to demand justice for Anwar since Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired him as deputy prime minister last
month and had him thrown in jail. The gatherings are banned by
police. Hundreds of protesters have been detained and jailed.
	   Anwar faces 10 counts of corruption and sodomy, charges he
denies and says are politically motivated.
	   His trial, likely to be the most sensational in Malaysian
history, begins Monday. Many foreign journalists, human rights
activists and justice-system observers were expected to attend.
	   Saturday's police deployment came ahead of Mahathir's visit to
the Petronas Twin Towers. The skyscrapers stand in the center of an
upscale shopping mall filled with boutiques and restaurants.
	   Dozens of policemen were also stationed around shopping malls in
downtown Kuala Lumpur, one of the venues of Saturday's planned
protest. A surveillance helicopter hovered overheard and police
trucks stood by water cannons.
	   Tourism minister Sabbaruddin Chik said Saturday that tourism had
dropped by 80 percent in the last month, following the
demonstrations. He blamed media reports for the lack of visitors.
	   ''If this is allowed to continue, the hotels, including the
five-star ones, risk closing down and this will lead to many
workers losing their jobs,'' Sabbaruddin was quoted as saying by
the national news agency Bernama.

 &UR; By the Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The text of Iraq's statement Saturday about U.N. weapons
monitoring as translated from Arabic by The Associated Press.
	    &UR; ___
	   Lifting sanctions is a great national humanitarian mission.
	   Iraq has dealt with the Security Council resolutions since they
were issued and complied with all related resolutions, although
they were unjust.
	   But this bitter experience, which lasted eight years, has proved
that America and its agents are controlling issues connected to
this problem, moving it with a clear target that is harming Iraq
and the Arab nation.
	   Iraq has been tolerant, patient, dealt diplomatically with all
attempts and communications which were supposed to lead to the
lifting of sanctions. But the sanctions were not lifted.
	   Events this year have exposed two additional dangerous facts.
The first is the American lies about the presidential sites, which
almost led to a destructive war. ...
	   The second is the dirty game that was played by the Special
Commission and its head in cooperation with America about the VX
claims. When the truth came out through neutral laboratories in
France and Switzerland, the head of the commission did not admit
the fact but kept requesting of Iraq more explanations with the
intention of prolonging and misleading. No act was taken against
Butler, which should have been taken because of his lies and
playing with facts.
	   Iraq was disappointed because lifting of the sanctions didn't go
in a normal fashion. The latest of these is what happened lately at
the Security Council under clear pressure from America to reject
Iraq's rights in explaining its compliance in the implementation of
Security Council Resolutions, especially Paragraph C from
Resolution 687, which is supposed to lead to the lifting of
sanctions.
	   Until the U.N. looks at the issue in an honest and positive way
leading to Iraq's right to the lifting of the unjust sanctions, and
until the U.N. takes firm measures by firing the president of the
Special Commission, Butler, and the reconstruction of the Special
Commission to make it a neutral and professional and international
organization distant from spying and intentionally harming (Iraq)
and serving America, the meeting decides:
	   The joint meeting decided to halt all kinds of dealings with the
Special Commission and its chief and stop all their activities
inside Iraq, including the monitoring starting from today.
	   This does not include the International Atomic Energy Agency.
They can continue their monitoring work as per the leadership
decision on Aug. 5 as long as these activities are done
independently of the Special Commission.

Pierce beats injured Farina in final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ Mary Pierce sailed to victory in the final of
the dlrs 164,250 Luxembourg Open Saturday, when opponent Silvia
Farina of Italy withdrew through injury while trailing 6-0, 2-0.
	   Farina retired after 35 minutes having already left the court
earlier for treatment on her thigh.
	   But it was clear from the beginning that Pierce was totally
dominant, with her powerful ground strokes and the fact that she
seemed much more confident than Farina.
	   The first set lasted 28 minutes and the second was only seven
minutes old when the match ended. Pierce hit an ace in the first
set and two in the second.
	   Pierce, 11th in the WTA rankings, walks away with dlrs 27,000
and a Toledo Seat car. She also won the Kremlin Cup in Moscow last
week.
	   ``I really had a great week here,'' she told a crowd of some
2,000 people at the end of the match.
	   Farina, No. 24 in the WTA rankings, had ousted ousted top seed
Nathalie Tauziat of France 6-2, 2-6, 6-3 to reach the final.

<TEXT>
	   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) _ North Korean leader Kim Jong Il has
approved multi-million dollar business ventures with longtime rival
South Korea in a meeting with the founder of the South's largest
conglomerate.
	   ``General Kim Jong Il and I agree to do everything that will
benefit both countries,'' Chung Ju-yung, 84, honorary chairman of
the Hyundai group, told journalists in the neutral village of
Panmunjom Saturday.
	   Returning Saturday across the heavily guarded border from his
five-day visit to the isolated communist state, Chung described the
56-year-old Kim as a ``very kind and respectful young man.''
	   Chung is the first known outsider to meet with Kim since he
completed his ascension to power in September.
	   In their meeting late Friday at a Pyongyang guest house, Kim
welcomed Hyundai's plan to send up to 2,000 tourists a week on
luxury cruise ships for tours of Diamond Mountain, a scenic
attraction on the North's east coast, Hyundai officials said.
	   In exchange for the right to develop Diamond Mountain with tax
exemptions, Hyundai agreed to pay North Korea dlrs 906 million over
the next six years in monthly payments, they said.
	   The sightseeing tour would be the largest inter-Korea joint
venture since the peninsula was divided into the communist North
and the capitalist South in 1945. The first cruise ship will sail
for the North on Nov. 18, Hyundai said.
	   South Korean President Kim Dae-jung has taken a ``sunshine
policy'' toward the North, encouraging his nation to push for
contacts outside the government with the North Korea, with hopes
that will help open up the North.
	   Kim Jong Il _ who took over leadership duties after his father
Kim Il Sung died in 1994 _ had been widely expected to welcome
badly needed outside capital to revive his country's economy.
	   The impoverished North now depends on outside aid to feed its 23
million people.
	   His blessing to Hyundai's projects may also signal a greater
openness from the North _ and a thawing of relations between the
North and the South.
	   North Korea has already opened its remote northeast corner of
Rajin-Sonbong as a free economic zone. But some of Hyundai's
projects call for foreign investment in the country's heartland.
	   South Korea's chief presidential Park Jie-won called Chung's
meeting with Kim ``a very significant development'' but refused
further comment.
	   Experts tend to have reservations about Hyundai plans because
joint-ventures between the two Koreas have always been vulnerable
to political and military tensions.
	   Still, Chung's extremely rare meeting with the North Korean
leader set off a media sensation here.
	   Major TV stations interrupted their regular programming to carry
special reports on their meeting, and newspapers carried front-page
articles.
	   North Korean newspapers also carried front-page reports with
photos, the North's official Korean Central News Agency said.
	   Other Hyundai-North Korea deals call for building a power plant
and gymnasium in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, as well as a
ship repair yard, and hotels, spas, golf courses and ski slopes
near Diamond Mountain.
	   North Korea and Hyundai also agreed to drill for oil on North
Korea's west coast and if successful, to lay an oil pipeline to
South Korea.
	   Hyundai will also build an industrial complex where South Korea
can relocate facilities to use North Korean labor _ estimated at
one-eighth the cost of South Korean labor.
	   Chung crossed the border Tuesday, with a convoy of 51 trucks
carrying 501 cattle and 20 Hyundai cars. In his first trip, in
June, he also took 500 cattle.

Haiti short of funds to rebuild after Hurricane Georges 
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL NORTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haiti has about dlrs 23 million at
its disposal to rebuild roads, bridges, and irrigation canals
destroyed by Hurricane Georges in September.
	   But it would take twice that to return the Western Hemisphere's
poorest country to its pre-hurricane level. And even before Georges
struck, Haiti was a disaster area.
	   Now ranked 159th out of 174 countries in the U.N. Human
Development Index _ which measures per capita income, life
expectancy, and degree of education _ Haiti has been falling
steadily since 1990, when it ranked 124th.
	   An estimated 700 million gourdes (dlrs 43.8 million) is required
to rebuild Haiti's damaged infrastructure, said Finance and
Economics Minister Fred Joseph at a Friday press conference.
	   And that is only for the areas hardest hit by the storm, which
struck Haiti Sept. 23.
	   Hurricane Georges killed more than 500 people in the Caribbean,
including 221 dead and 30 missing and feared dead in Haiti. Only
the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with
Haiti, suffered more deaths.
	   The United States has pledged 210 million gourdes (dlrs 13.1
million) and the Inter-American Development Bank 132 million
gourdes (dlrs 8.3 million) in emergency infrastructure assistance.
Another 25 million gourdes (dlrs 1.6 million) will come from the
Haiti treasury.
	   The United Nations and several industrialized countries have
contributed towards Haiti's recovery. But the nation's poverty has
created problems that will be difficult to overcome.
	   Most Haitian deaths during the hurricane were blamed on flooding
and mudslides in rural, mountainous areas. For generations, Haitian
peasants have cut down trees to make charcoal, denuding mountains
and making them unable to absorb rainfall. A flash flood nearly
destroyed the southeastern border town of Fonds Verrettes, where
102 people died.
	   Georges also destroyed thousands of homes and killed more than
56,000 head of livestock.
	   Economists predict a sharp rise in the cost of living by the end
of the year, since rice and beans, which are Haitian staples, will
have to be imported in greater quantities.

Split between Mandela and his deputy president denied
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREW SELSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Deputy President Thabo Mbeki
denied on Saturday he and President Nelson Mandela were divided
over the ruling African National Congress' bitter reaction to a
report on apartheid-era abuses.
	   The long-awaited report by the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission blames the ANC for gross human rights violations during
its anti-apartheid struggle, saying the group tortured suspected
spies and dissidents and killed innocent civilians with land mines
and bombs.
	   Mbeki _ who became ANC president last year and will likely be
elected South Africa's next president in 1999 _ took a hard line
Saturday against the report, and indicated all ANC members must do
the same.
	   ``No member of ... the ANC can ever concur with the scurrilous
attempts to criminalize the liberation struggle ... as gross human
rights violations,'' Mbeki's office said in a statement.
	   The ANC had asked a court early Thursday to block the report's
release. A judge turned down the petition. The report was released
later in the day.
	   A Johannesburg newspaper reported Saturday that Mandela would
have been content for the report to be released as written, but
that Mbeki ``overruled'' Mandela and insisted the party seek the
court injunction.
	   Mbeki denied the report in the Saturday Star.
	   Before the ANC went to court, ANC Secretary-General Kgalema
Motlanthe briefed Mandela on the decision, but ``Mandela was not
expected to and did not express an opinion on the intentions of the
ANC,'' Mbeki's statement said.
	   Motlanthe himself contradicted that Saturday, telling reporters
that in his telephone conversation with Mandela, the president had
approved the ANC's decision.
	   ANC spokesman Thabo Masebi also said Mandela had agreed with the
decision.
	   ``I was there when Motlanthe called President Mandela,'' Masebi
said in a telephone interview. ``President Mandela said that under
the circumstances, the ANC was making a correct decision.''
	   Mandela himself has maintained public silence on the ANC's
attempts to block the report's release.
	   The ANC's legal action outraged the Truth Commission chairman,
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, one of the staunchest opponents of white
rule.
	   Tutu said the ANC was showing signs of the same dictatorial rule
it fought so hard to overthrow.
	   ``I didn't struggle in order to remove one set of those who
thought they were tin gods to replace them with others who are
tempted to think they are,'' Tutu said on Friday.
	   The Truth Commission report was the culmination of 2 1/2 years
of collecting evidence from victims and perpetrators.
	   As expected, the former apartheid government received most of
the blame for gross human rights violations.

Parma upsets Fiorentina 2-0, Bologna downs Venezia 2-0

	   ROME (AP) _ Two spectacular goals by young Argentine striker
Hernan Jorge Crespo gave Parma a 2-0 upset victory against league
leader Fiorentina in Saturday's seventh-round games of the Italian
Serie A.
	   The third season win lifted the Parma team closer to the top of
the first division standings (12 points, 3-3-1) while Fiorentina
suffered the second upset of the campaign as its stellar forward
line led by Gabriel Batistuta and Edmundo was shut out by the
league strongest defense.
	   Crespo, goalless in the previous six rounds, opened the scoring
in the 36th minute, diving to head into the Florentine net a
perfect cross by Italian International Enrico Chiesa.
	   Again fed by Chiesa, the 23-year-old Argentine forward made it
2-0 in the 52nd with a powerful drive which sent the ball just
under the bar.
	   Crespo received a standing ovation by Parma fans _ often
critical of the Argentine player _ when he left the field in the
58th, replaced by veteran Abel Balbo.
	   Despite defeat Fiorentina still sat atop the serie A standings
with 15 points.
	   However defending league champion Juventus of Turin, with 13
points in six rounds, could take over the leadership following
Sunday's games.
	   The Turin team hosts Sampdoria at Delle Alpi arena.
	   Low-ranked Bologna downed next-to-last Venezia 2-0 in another of
three games played Saturday because of UEFA Cup commitments of some
Italian teams.
	   AS Roma took on Udinese at Rome's Olympic stadium in a late
match.
	   Fiorentina, starting the best Serie A offense with 13 goals, was
unable to break through Parma's defense which included such stars
as France's World Champion Lilian Thuram, Argentine veteran Nestor
Sensini and Italian inrternational Fabio Cannavaro.
	   Parma allowed only two goals in seven games, while scoring six.
	   Batistuta, the leading league striker with 8 goals, had no
scoring chances throughout the game as his much-prolific
partnership with Edmundo did not work at Parma's Tardini stadium.
	   The Argentine striker could only lament a couple of questionable
interventions by Parma defenders inside the penalty area.
	   The only threat for Parma's goalie Gianluigi Buffon came on a
second-half long-distance shot by Portuguese midfielder Rui Costa.
Buffon, Italy's national team keeper, dived and saved.
	   In Venice, forward Jonathan Binotto put Bologna in front with a
lob from the penalty area edge in the 71st minute.
	   Brazilian Eriberto scored Bologna's second goal in injury time
(94th) kicking the ball into an empty net following a quick
counter-attack.
	   Venezia's goalie Massimo Taibi had left his goal unguarded in a
futile offensive raid in occasion of a last-minute corner kick in
the opposite penalty area.
	   The young Brazilian started the action in his own midfield,
resisted tackles of two defensers and kicked in at ease.
	   The victory on the road gave Bologna nine points, or 2-3-2.
Venezia was left with two points (0-2-5).

France critical of Iraq's break with U.N. weapons inspections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France said Saturday it ``deplores'' Iraq's
decision to halt dealings with the U.N. Special Commission, and
urged Iraq to reconsider its position.
	   ``France profoundly deplores Iraq's decision to totally
interrupt cooperation with the Special Commission,'' the French
Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
	   ``France insists that Iraq resume its full and total cooperation
with the United Nations,'' the statement added.
	   Iraq announced Saturday it is halting all dealings with the U.N.
Special Commission, which is charged with investigating the
country's weapons of mass destruction.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Jordan's prime minister met with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Saturday to discuss the latest
Mideast peace accord and called on Israel to carry out its side of
the deal.
	   On his first trip to autonomous Palestinian areas since taking
office in August, Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh held two hours of
talks with President Arafat in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
	   Arafat said the two men shared ``positive and important talks
that touched on many issues.'' He thanked Jordan for its
cooperation on all issues.
	   ``We will constantly coordinate on all issues that will help
implementation,'' said Tarawneh. He called on Israel to do the
same.
	   Jordan's King Hussein was instrumental in arranging the latest
peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians signed last week in
Washington.
	   Shuttling to the Mideast summit outside of Washington twice from
cancer treatment in Rochester, Minnesota, the king has been hailed
for his assistance in bridging the gaps between the two former
adversaries.
	   The deal calls on the Palestinian Authority to crackdown on
militant groups operating within its territories.
	   Khaled Maashal, a senior figure in the militant Palestinian
group Hamas, lives in Jordan. Israel has often said orders for
terror attacks on Israeli civilians come from there.
	   Asked whether Jordan plans to take similar measures against
Hamas stationed in his country, Tarawneh said ``Hamas has no
leadership, no representation and no bases in Jordan.''
	   Tarawneh was accompanied by senior economic aides, including
Trade, Industry and Supply Minister Mohammed Saleh Hourani, State
Minister for Development Taher Kanaan, Information Minister Nasser
Judeh and Foreign Minister Abdul-Illah Khatib.
	   In addition to Mideast peace, the two leaders discussed economic
cooperation and ways to overcome trade barriers due to Israeli
control of the borders between the Palestinian territories and
Jordan.

Report: Nigerian state to aid families of blast victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Note spelling of newspaper `Lagos ThisDay' in 2nd graf is
correct.

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Bowing to calls for state compensation,
Nigeria's military leaders will give payouts to families of some
700 people killed in a pipeline inferno blamed on vandals who may
have been scavenging gas when the pipe exploded, a report said
Saturday.
	   Relatives of the dead and an unknown number of injured in the
blast on Oct. 17 in the southwest Nigeria town of Jesse, about 300
kilometers (190 miles) southeast of Lagos, will receive
compensation payments worth about dlrs 300 each from the
state-controlled Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Lagos
ThisDay reported.
	   Military ruler Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar had been criticized by
human right groups for announcing several days after the blast that
the government would not compensate families for the deaths and
only help pay the hospital bills of the injured.
	   Authorities believe many of the victims of the Jesse explosion
were trying to scavenge gasoline gushing from a leaking pipeline
when it ignited _ possibly by a cigarette or the spark of tools
used by vandals who may have broke open the pipe.
	   Sabotage of petroleum installations in this oil-rich West
African country is common _ although usually the vandalism is aimed
by community groups at forcing aid packages from multinational
companies and the government.
	   Despite being the world's sixth largest oil producer, Nigeria
has serious shortages that cause long lineups at the gasoline pumps
and a sharp price increase of blackmarket fuel.

Britain calls Iraqi decision unacceptable
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Iraq-UN &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Iraq's decision to break off all dealings with the
United Nations Special Commission is ``totally unacceptable,''
Britain said Saturday.
	   Iraq's decision to cut its links to the international body
charged with investigating its weapons of mass destruction,
followed a meeting between Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, his top
advisers and leaders of his ruling Baath Party.
	   Iraq said its action reflected displeasure with Friday's U.N.
Security Council decision to review Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions _ but without the guarantee that Iraq had demanded that
this would lead to a lifting of trade sanctions.
	   ``Iraq is again flouting the Security Council resolutions and
the memorandum of understanding it signed with the U.N. secretary
general,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said after hearing news of
Iraq's decision. ``If this reported decision is confirmed it will
be totally unacceptable.''
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq after the 1991 Gulf
War to force Saddam to give up his weapons of mass destruction. It
refuses to lift the sanctions until U.N. inspectors certify Iraq
has eliminated all banned weapons.
	   Britain, which contributed to the U.S.-led forces in the Gulf
War to drive the Iraqis out of Kuwait, also sent forces to the
Persian Gulf earlier this year, after Iraq refused to open
presidential sites to U.N. inspectors.That crisis was defused by an
agreement brokered in February by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan.
	   Britain has vowed that the United States can count on British
military support in the Persian Gulf if Iraq backslides on
inspection agreements.

Iraq breaks off dealings with U.N. Special Commission

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a move that could provoke a showdown
with the United Nations, Iraq announced Saturday it would no longer
allow U.N. weapons inspectors to work in the country.
	   The decision by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his top
advisers exempted only a handful of experts from the International
Atomic Energy Agency, who monitor suspected nuclear sites.
	   The move was seen as a response to a U.N. Security Council
decision Friday to review Iraq's progress on eliminating prohibited
weapons.
	   Although it pledged a ``comprehensive review,'' the council did
not accede to Iraq's demand that the review lead directly to the
removal of the sweeping trade sanctions imposed in 1990 after
Baghdad's forces invaded Kuwait.
	   The Iraqi statement said the ban would continue ``until the
United Nations looks at the issue in an honest and positive way,
leading to Iraq's right to the lifting of the unjust sanctions.''
	   Iraq also insisted that the Security Council fire Richard
Butler, chief of the U.N. Special Commission that oversees weapons
inspections. Iraq has long charged that Butler is working on behalf
of the United States to prolong the sanctions.
	   It remained unclear if Saturday's decision would provoke the
United States and Britain to threaten military action against
Baghdad, as they did earlier this year after the Iraqi regime
prevented U.N. inspectors from entering Saddam's presidential
palaces.
	   In Washington, a spokesman for the National Security Council
said the body would meet later Saturday to discuss the matter.
	   ``We view this as a serious matter,'' said David Leavy. ``We are
currently consulting with allies and with officials at the United
Nations.''
	   In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said on customary
condition of anonymity that if the reported ban were true, ``it
will be totally unacceptable.''
	   ``Iraq is again flouting the Security Council resolutions and
the memorandum of understanding it signed with the U.N. secretary
general.''
	   The British spokesman was referring to agreement signed in
February when U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan negotiated a
formula to allow the inspectors to enter the palaces. The
compromise defused the threat of air strikes, but the United States
still maintains considerable fire power in the Gulf.
	   Saddam Hussein's decision Saturday caused jitters in Baghdad.
Currency traders said the already depressed Iraqi dinar fell from
1660 to the dollar to 1760 from within minutes of the announcement.
	   Officials at the U.N. Special Commission in Baghdad declined to
take calls and issued no statements Saturday.
	   Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told reporters the
country would stand firm.
	   ``This is the decision of the people of Iraq and the leadership
of Iraq to save the sovereignty of Iraq and the right of the people
to live,'' Saleh said.
	   The sanctions have severely damaged the Iraqi economy by
limiting the sale of oil, banning air travel and prohibiting most
other financial dealings with Iraq.
	   Saturday's decision deepens a dispute that began Aug. 5, when
Iraq announced that teams from the special commission and the
atomic agency could no longer carry out spot inspections. But Iraq
allowed both groups to continue long-term monitoring _ often done
with cameras and sensors _ at previously identified weapons sites.
	   Now the commission must ``stop all their activities inside
Iraq'' aimed at destroying biological and chemical weapons and
long-range missiles, the statement said. Atomic agency monitors,
however, will be allowed to continue working.
	   There currently are about 120 monitors and U.N. support staff in
Baghdad.
	   The statement insisted that Iraq has ``complied with all related
resolutions'' of the Security Council. It blamed ``America and its
agents'' for blocking the lifting of sanctions.
	   ``Iraq was disappointed because lifting of the sanctions didn't
go in a normal fashion,'' the statement said. It added that the
Security Council decision Friday had been made under ``clear
pressure from America.''
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until the special commission
certifies that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq insists it has done so, but the commission alleges that
Baghdad continues to hide information on weapons, especially those
with biological and chemical agents.

VW planning car factory in Poland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Two days after carmaker Opel opened a new factory
in Poland, Volkswagen said Saturday it also is planning to build
cars there.
	   The Welt am Sonntag newspaper said VW plans to invest 350
million marks (dlrs 220 million) on the Polish plant, which will
initially produce the VW Polo and Skoda Octavia, mainly for eastern
European markets.
	   VW currently assembles cars in Poznan from kits to avoid high
Polish import taxes, the newspaper said.
	   A VW spokesman confirmed a factory was planned for Poznan, in
western Poland. But he refused to comment further until the final
decision is made, probably by the end of the year.
	   Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors, opened a new
factory in Gleiwitz, Poland, last Thursday.

Krajicek upsets Sampras to reach final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kafelnikov beating Bjorkman &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Richard Krajicek, one of the few
players to have a winning record against Pete Sampras, upset the
No. 1 again Saturday to reach the final of the dlrs 2.45 million
dollars Eurocard Open.
	   Krajicek used his overpowering serve to beat Sampras 6-7 (2-7),
6-4, 7-6 (7-5) and bolster his chances of qualifying for the
season-ending World Championship next month in Hanover, Germany.
	   ``You have to play on the limit against Pete and hope he makes
one or two mistakes,'' Krajicek said.
	   In the final, Krajicek will play 10th-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov,
who beat Jonas Bjorkman 6-2, 7-5, breaking serve to win the match.
	   Krajicek, ranked No. 11 in the world, improved his record
against Sampras to 5-2 and has won the last three encounters.
	   Wimbledon champion in 1996, Krajicek also has a good record in
Stuttgart: he won the title in 1995 and has reached his second
consecutive final.
	   Sampras is assured of keeping his top ranking at least through
next week's Paris indoor tournament and the battle for No. 1 is
unlikely to be settled until Hanover.
	   But the loss could make it more difficult for Sampras to become
the first player to finish as No. 1 for six years in a row.
	   ``It's a tough one to take at this point. I'll have to try to
regroup,'' Sampras said. ``he seems to play with no fear against
me.''
	   Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion, saved a set point in the
opening set with a couple of good serves and Sampras then fought
off two break points to force a tiebreaker. A cross-court forehand
winner gave him the set.
	   Sampras saved two set points in the second, hitting an ace on
one of them. Going for a big second serve, he hit it just a bit
long for his third double-fault if the game to give Krajicek the
second set.
	   ``I was going for big second serves the entire match and I
pushed some long,'' Sampras said. ``I got tight.''
	   The American had another double-fault in the decisive tiebreaker
to fall down 4-2 and he never recovered.
	   Krajicek hit an ace to gain three match points. Sampras saved
the first two with service winners but the Dutchman clinched the
match with a volley on the next.
	   ``It's very frustrating, I felt I was playing very well this
week and had a chance to win this tournament,'' said Sampras,
winner of 11 Grand Slam titles, one short of Roy Emerson's record.
	   ``The key was how well I returned his second serve and I wasn't
good enough, I didn't put enough pressure,'' Sampras said. ``He is
very devastating.''
	   Although Sampras had one more ace than Krajicek, 17-16, Krajicek
won 91 percent of his first-serve points, compared to 80 percent
for Sampras.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a move that could provoke a showdown
with the United Nations, Iraq announced Saturday it would no longer
allow U.N. weapons inspectors to work in the country.
	   The decision by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his top
advisers exempted only a handful of experts from the International
Atomic Energy Agency, who monitor suspected nuclear sites.
	   The move was seen as a response to a U.N. Security Council
decision Friday to review Iraq's progress on eliminating prohibited
weapons.
	   Although it pledged a ``comprehensive review,'' the council did
not accede to Iraq's demand that the review lead directly to the
removal of the sweeping trade sanctions imposed in 1990 after
Baghdad's forces invaded Kuwait.
	   The Iraqi statement said the ban would continue ``until the
United Nations looks at the issue in an honest and positive way,
leading to Iraq's right to the lifting of the unjust sanctions.''
	   Iraq also insisted that the Security Council fire Richard
Butler, chief of the U.N. Special Commission that oversees weapons
inspections. Iraq has long charged that Butler is working on behalf
of the United States to prolong the sanctions.
	   It remained unclear if Saturday's decision would provoke the
United States and Britain to threaten military action against
Baghdad, as they did earlier this year after the Iraqi regime
prevented U.N. inspectors from entering Saddam's presidential
palaces.
	   In Washington, a spokesman for the National Security Council
said the body would meet later Saturday to discuss the matter.
	   ``We view this as a serious matter,'' said David Leavy. ``We are
currently consulting with allies and with officials at the United
Nations.''

condition of anonymity that such a ban would be ``totally
unacceptable.''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a move that could provoke a showdown
with the United Nations, Iraq announced Saturday that it would no
longer allow U.N. weapons inspectors to work in the country.
	   The decision by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his top
advisers exempted only a handful of experts from the International
Atomic Energy Agency, who monitor suspected nuclear sites.
	   The move was seen as a response to a U.N. Security Council
decision Friday to review Iraq's progress on eliminating prohibited
weapons.
	   Although it pledged a ``comprehensive review,'' the council did
not accede to Iraq's demand that the review lead directly to the
removal of the sweeping trade sanctions imposed in 1990 after
Baghdad's forces invaded Kuwait.
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until the Special Commission
certifies that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq insists it has done so, but the commission says Baghdad
continues to hide information on weapons, especially those with
biological and chemical agents.
	   The Iraqi statement said the ban would continue ``until the
United Nations looks at the issue in an honest and positive way,
leading to Iraq's right to the lifting of the unjust sanctions.''
	   Iraq also insisted that the Security Council fire Richard
Butler, chief of the U.N. Special Commission that oversees weapons
inspections. Iraq has long accused Butler of working on behalf of
the United States to prolong sanctions.
	   It remained unclear if Saturday's decision would provoke the
United States and Britain to threaten military action against
Baghdad, as they did earlier this year after the Iraqi regime
prevented U.N. inspectors from entering Saddam's presidential
palaces.
	   In Washington, a spokesman for the National Security Council
said the body would meet later Saturday. ``We view this as a
serious matter,'' said David Leavy. ``We are currently consulting
with allies and with officials at the United Nations.''
	   In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said it ``deplores''
Iraq's decision. ``France insists that Iraq resume its full and
total cooperation with the United Nations,'' the statement added.
	   In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said on customary
condition of anonymity that the decision were true, ``it will be
totally unacceptable.''
	   ``Iraq is again flouting the Security Council resolutions and
the memorandum of understanding it signed with the U.N.
secretary-general,'' the spokesman said, referring to the February
agreement negotiated by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   The deal defused the threat of airstrikes, but the United States
still maintains considerable firepower in the Gulf.
	   Saddam Hussein's decision Saturday caused jitters in Baghdad.
Currency traders said the already depressed Iraqi dinar fell from
1660 to the dollar to 1760 from within minutes of the announcement.
	   Officials at the U.N. Special Commission in Baghdad declined to
take calls and issued no statements Saturday.
	   Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told reporters that
the country would stand firm.
	   ``This is the decision of the people of Iraq and the leadership
of Iraq to save the sovereignty of Iraq and the right of the people
to live,'' Saleh said.
	   The sanctions have severely damaged the Iraqi economy by
limiting the sale of oil, banning air travel and prohibiting most
other financial dealings with Iraq.
	   Saturday's decision deepens a dispute that began Aug. 5, when
Iraq announced that teams from the Special Commission and the
atomic agency could no longer carry out spot inspections. But Iraq
allowed both groups to continue long-term monitoring, often done
with cameras and sensors, at previously identified weapons sites.
	   Now the commission must ``stop all their activities inside
Iraq'' that relate to destroying biological and chemical weapons
and long-range missiles, the statement said. Atomic agency
monitors, however, will be allowed to continue working.
	   There are about 120 monitors and U.N. support staff in Baghdad.
	   The statement insisted that Iraq has ``complied with all related
resolutions'' of the Security Council. It blamed ``America and its
agents'' for blocking the lifting of sanctions.
	   ``Iraq was disappointed because lifting of the sanctions didn't
go in a normal fashion,'' the statement said. It added that the
Security Council decision Friday had been made under ``clear
pressure from America.''

Russia's Cabinet approves anti-crisis plan

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government approved a long-awaited
plan Saturday to pull the country out of its economic crisis,
steering a middle course that the prime minister compared to
Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal.
	   The plan includes price controls and support to industry, but
steers clear of some of the stronger, Soviet-style measures that
were rumored to be in the works. At least one key plank _
resumption of loans from the International Monetary Fund _ remains
unresolved.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov stressed that Russia is not
turning its back on free market reforms, but rather is using the
power of the state to save them.
	   ``The regulatory function of the state is especially important
during the crisis. ... There have been many examples of state
controls helping a free-market economy develop,'' Primakov said.
	   The economics minister said the plan relies on as-yet-unreleased
IMF loans, but Primakov insisted that Russia would survive with or
without foreign aid.
	   ``It would be easier for us to stand on our feet if we get
(outside) support, but if we don't get it Russia will neither lie
down nor fall on its knees,'' Primakov told reporters after the
special Cabinet meeting.
	   IMF officials failed to reach agreement with Russian officials
this week on resuming a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package. The
bailout was signed this summer but frozen after Russia defaulted on
some debts and devalued the ruble Aug. 17.
	   The IMF had demanded to see an anti-crisis plan and some sign
that it was being implemented. The government, named after Yeltsin
fired its predecessor the week after the August default, had been
criticized for dragging its feet on a blueprint for solving the
worst crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The government's plan, calling for a ``softer social policy,''
took into account the IMF's suggestions, First Deputy Prime
Minister Yuri Maslyukov's office said.
	   Primakov said the government agreed with some of the advice but
not all, especially when it came to IMF criticism of increased
government influence in the economy. He said state support for
ailing industries is vital.
	   ``By all means, we will preserve and develop the free-market
system, but the free-market economy can't develop normally without
industrial growth,'' the prime minister said.
	   The plan foresees lowering profit taxes and VAT to create
incentives for industrial growth, as well as an overhaul of the
banking sector.
	   Primakov said the government would introduce price controls on
some key medicines but not food.
	   The government hopes to fill state coffers by tightening
controls over alcohol production and sales, more efficiently
handling its assets and cracking down on tax dodging and
corruption.
	   Primakov admitted that Russia will likely print more money to
cover its massive debts, ``but the amount would be minimal and we
will not allow it to lead to high inflation.''
	   The government expects inflation to stay no higher than 5
percent a month until the end of the year, and no higher than 30
percent for all of 1999.
	   Primakov lashed out at comments by liberal leader Grigory
Yavlinsky that corrupt Russian officials embezzled most of the
previous IMF loans.
	   ``The (accusations) are aimed at giving the IMF a pretext to
reject the next disbursements,'' Primakov said.
	   ``Of course, a certain part of them got into dirty hands, but a
major part was spent on its intended purpose,'' he said.

South Africa considers killing elephants in Kruger National Park
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NELSPRUIT, South Africa (AP) _ Conservation officials on
Saturday proposed killing some elephants in one of Africa's largest
parks, saying elephant overpopulation threatens other species.
	   The practice of ``culling'' elephants in Kruger National Park
was suspended in 1996 pending a review of the controversial policy.
	   After conducting the review, park officials now recommend that
the Israel-sized park be divided into six zones. In some, elephants
would be allowed to multiply, but in others, their populations
would provisionally be reduced by 7 percent per year.
	   Elephants in those zones would be moved elsewhere or killed by
marksmen aboard helicopters, according to the recommendations.
	   A single elephant, the world's largest land mammal, devours up
to 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of grass, leaves and twigs a day, and
often winds up killing trees.
	   With 8,600 elephants currently in the park, ``their numbers will
at some stage grow to a level where their impact will result in
irreversible loss of biodiversity'' and the local extinction of
some tree species, according to a report containing the
recommendations.
	   Park conservation officials presented the report at a public
hearing in Nelspruit, a town in eastern South Africa near the
park's boundary.
	   The Parks Board will consider the recommendations in November.
If the board approves them as expected, they will be implemented
next year, said Leo Braack, Kruger's conservation manager.

Three Indian Armymen said abducted by Pakistani militants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   URI, India (AP) _ An Indian military officer and two soldiers
were abducted by Pakistani militants in a densely forested
mountainous stretch near India's disputed border with Pakistan and
taken across the border, a source said Saturday.
	   The soldiers were part of a five-member army patrol and
disappeared late Friday in the Uri region, about 100 kilometers (62
miles) north of Srinagar, capital of the northern frontier state of
Jammu-Kashmir, said the source who refused to be named or in any
way identified because of the sensitivity of the story.
	   There was no immediate comment from the army.
	   The source said the abducted armymen, who were fired at by the
militants, were believed to have been taken to the Muzaffarabad
region of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir.
	   The armymen were not found in an intensive search in the area by
the local army unit.
	   Top Indian military officials had opened dialogue with Pakistani
military officials but it was not known if the Pakistani side knew
of the alleged abductions, the source said.
	   India accuses Pakistan of arming and funding the nine-year-old
Muslim insurgency in Kashmir against Indian rule, which has claimed
over 15,000 lives. Pakistan denies the charge but acknowledges it
provides ideological support.
	   Indian officials say more than 6,000 infiltrators, who New Delhi
says are mostly militants armed by Pakistan, crossed into Indian
territory last year.

Pinochet's wife thanks supporters, says his recovery is slow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The wife of Gen. Augusto Pinochet on Saturday
thanked those who supported him and said she hoped her husband, who
is hospitalized under guard and barred from leaving, would be able
to return soon to Chile.
	   ``The health of my husband is recovering very slowly because of
the situation he is in,'' a frail-looking Lucia Hiriart told a
brief news conference at a London hotel.
	   Her 82-year-old husband, the former Chilean dictator who
underwent back surgery in a London hospital, was arrested Oct. 16
on a Spanish warrant seeking to extradite him on charges of
genocide and terrorism during his 17-year-rule.
	   Lucia Hiriart, who refused to discuss her husband's legal
situation, told reporters, ``I feel very weak physically and
mentally.''
	   ``The last few days have been very sad for me. Even my own
health physically and mentally has been damaged,'' she said in
Spanish.
	   She was quoted Friday in a Chilean newspaper as asking that
``pressure be made through the governments of the world so he can
be released. ... Humanitarian reasons should take precedence over
anything else.''
	   Spanish prosecutors allege that Pinochet was responsible for up
to 4,000 murders, including at least one in the United States, and
had sent agents to Spain to kill opponents there. He ruled from
1973 until 1990.
	   Pinochet's attorneys filed a petition for his release with
England's High Court, which ruled Wednesday that he was immune from
prosecution as a former head of state.
	   The court added, however, that Pinochet could not leave Britain
until prosecutors appealed the ruling to a five-judge tribunal in
the House of Lords, which will hear the case next week.
	   On Friday, a British judge granted Pinochet's request for bail,
but decreed that he must remain at the north London hospital where
he is recuperating, under police guard at all times.

Danger of flooding remains high in soggy western Germany
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with some flooding in Koblenz, Cologne dry &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MAINZ, Germany (AP) _ Hundreds of soldiers and firefighters
reinforced dams and pumped out flooded cellars Saturday in western
Germany as water levels continued to climb on two major rivers due
to heavy rain.
	   The Rhine was reported rising at Koblenz and the Mosel was
nearing the critical 10-meter (33-feet) mark near Trier, with
low-lying areas already seeing some flooding.
	   With more deluges predicted for Sunday, forecasters were no
longer discounting the possibility of a catastrophe similar to
weeks of flooding along the Rhine in January 1995.
	   Cologne's historic old town was again under threat, but still
dry. Upriver in Koblenz, though, the Rhine was already pouring into
numerous cellars and entering the first floor of some homes.
	   ``The situation isn't critical yet,'' said Koblenz fire
department spokesman Michael Gilzmer. But ``we're preparing for
evacuations, getting emergency food supplies ready and organizing
transportation.''
	   People in flooded homes would be taken to work or shopping by
boat if necessary, he added.
	   In Baden-Baden, which saw its worst flooding in decades late
Wednesday, the Oos river was dropping steadily. Emergency crews
were kept on alert, though, because earthen dams were already so
saturated even smaller amounts of rain posed a threat.
	   Water levels also dropped by more than a meter (yard) on the
Saar River, although several major roads in Saarbruecken, near the
French border, remained flooded.
	   Two hundred soldiers were reinforcing dams along the Hase and
Hunte rivers near Haseluenne and Oldenburg, in Lower Saxony state.
Interior Ministry spokesman Ingo Marek said rain and snow in the
nearby Harz mountains could push water levels higher.
	   Ship traffic remained stopped on the swollen Neckar River and on
the Rhine between Koblenz and Oberwinter. Barges on the Rhine by
Mannheim and Karlsruhe were ordered to move slowly so as not to
damage the shores with their wakes.

More Americans joining Kosovo observer mission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With Western powers trying to get a
2,000-member verification mission started in Kosovo, a U.S.
official said dozens more Americans would start arriving Saturday.
	   Richard Huckaby, spokesman for the U.S. portion of the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission, known as KDOM, said 13 Americans were
expected in Pristina on Saturday and another 70 would come by the
middle of next week.
	   The new arrivals would join 48 Americans working for KDOM,
Huckaby said.
	   Also Saturday, Julia Taft, the U.S. assistant secretary of
state, was expected in Pristina to start a trip that would include
visiting villages and meeting with relief and refugee agencies.
	   The United States has led the Western effort to pressure
Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic to halt a seven-month
crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people have died in fighting that sent an estimated
300,000 people fleeing as refugees in the troubled southern Serbian
province where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-1.
	   Under the threat of NATO airstrikes, Milosevic agreed to
withdraw troops and police he sent into Kosovo when he launched the
crackdown in February and to allow relief agencies full access to
refugees.
	   The agreement he reached with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke also
called for the 2,000-member observer mission run by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to verify
Milosevic's compliance.
	   Many of the observers now working for KDOM are expected to
become verifiers in the OSCE mission, which is still setting up its
headquarters in Pristina.
	   ``Gradually we are going to be under the umbrella of OSCE but
the schedule and details are still being decided,'' Huckaby said
	   An OSCE spokesman has said the mission is still at least a few
days away from bringing in its first observers to work in the
field.
	   Kosovo's main ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, on Friday
urged the United States and Europe to speed up the verification
mission because large numbers of Serb forces remain in Kosovo.
	   The Serb police and Yugoslav soldiers continue to maintain a
visible presence in many areas of the province. A few police
checkpoints continue operating near strongholds of the ethnic
Albanian guerrilla movement, the Kosovo Liberation Army, and police
vehicles still regularly patrol some regions.
	   Most of the estimated 50,000 refugees who had been living in the
woods of Kosovo are believed to have moved to villages, and
thousands of refugees have returned to their homes. But the
continued police and military presence in some areas scares others
from going back.

Jailed militant leaders support call for cease fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The imprisoned leaders of Egypt's most
violent militant group expressed their support for a cease fire in
a statement released Saturday.
	   The statement, which was smuggled out of prison and released by
lawyers, backs the stand of their jailed leader in the United
States and rebuts the call for a continuation of the armed struggle
issued by certain leaders in exile last year.
	   The leadership of Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya, or Islamic Group,
reaffirmed their ``complete support for ending armed operations by
Al-Gamaa in Egypt,'' and called on all followers to adhere to the
cease fire, said the statement from the inmates of Torah prison
outside Cairo.
	   Nineteen leaders of the group signed the statement, which spoke
of their ``full compliance'' with the call for a halt to violence
issued by Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, who is in a U.S. prison for
conspiring to blow up a number of New York landmarks.
	   In early October, Abdel-Rahman, the group's spiritual leader,
renewed his support for a July 1997 cease fire between the Egyptian
government and the imprisoned leaders of Al-Gamaa.
	   Later in 1997 hard-line leaders of Al-Gamaa in exile issued a
statement rejecting any truce.
	   The Egyptian government has dismissed the cease fire call as
posturing.
	   In a related development Saturday, military prosecutors began
investigating charges against 43 suspected Muslim militants,
including 13 who have deported from Albania, a security official
said.
	   The militants are suspected of planing to attack a number of
targets in Egypt, but no charges have yet been filed, the official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Among the suspects is Mohammed Sayed el-Naggar, who has been
sentenced to death in absentia for his role in an abortive plot in
1995 to blow up Khan el-Khalili, Cairo's leading tourist bazaar.
	   El-Naggar is among 13 Egyptians who were extradited a few months
ago from Albania where they were allegedly preparing to fight
alongside Muslims against Serb forces in Yugoslavia, the official
said.
	   The 13 men are believed to be affiliated with Islamic Jihad, the
smaller of the two main militant groups in Egypt.
	   Egypt has yet to confirm or comment on the deportations, but
Albanian sources have said that four men were spirited out of the
country with the assistance of American agents.
	   Egypt stepped up its crackdown on militants after 67 foreign
tourists were murdered in two separate incidents in 1997.
	   More than 1,200 people, mostly militants and police, have died
since Muslim extremists began a campaign to topple the secular
government and install Islamic rule in 1992.

Small blast damages cabinet offices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) - A homemade bomb exploded outside the
downtown offices of two cabinet members Saturday, causing damage
but no injuries, police said.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack
which occurred two days after a cabinet reshuffle.
	   Police said the explosive device, made using propane gas
canisters, was placed outside the third-floor private office of
Agriculture Undersecretary Paraskevas Foudas, which he shares with
two deputies of the ruling Socialist party.
	   The office of Public Order Minister Philipos Petsalnikos, on the
same floor, was also damaged.
	   The offices or another minister and two Socialist deputies are
also housed in the same building.
	   Shadowy anarchist groups little known to authorities have over
the past year claimed more than 100 attacks on cars and offices
belonging to politicians, policemen, officials, diplomats,
journalists and foreigners.
	   On Friday, a similar type of bomb went off outside a suburban
Athens branch of the state-owned Ionian Bank, causing damage but no
injuries.

Inter leads list of big money losers among Italian clubs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Internazionale of Milan, while posting the
largest loss among Italian Serie A soccer clubs for the 1997-98
fiscal year, said Saturday that Ronaldo might soon be a
shareholder.
	   The club reported a 44.8 billion lire (dlrs 27.1 million)
deficit, more than double the previous year's.
	   ``We are glad to welcome Ronaldo among the club shareholders,''
said oil industrialist Massimo Moratti, who last year engineered
the costly transfer of the Brazilian striker from Barcelona.
	   Moratti, who holds a controlling stake in the club, said he was
going to sell Ronaldo an undisclosed amount of shares from his own
stake.
	   Most Italian soccer clubs are seeking quotation on the Milan
stock market.
	   Lazio, the only Italian club officially listed so far, posted a
profit of 6.5 billion lire (dlrs 3.9 million) in the last fiscal
year despite the costly purchase of star-forwards Marcelo Salas and
Christian Vieri.
	   Lazio's owner Sergio Cragnotti promised a better profit next
year as a result of higher televsion rights and sales from
merchandising.
	   Juventus of Turin, which is owned by the Agnelli family of auto
tycoons, posted a profit of 16.3 billion lire (dlrs 9.8 million),
taking advantage of a surplus from the transfer campaign.
	   Like its crosstown rival Inter, AC Milan, the club of media
tycoon and former premier Silvio Berlusconi posted a loss, of 24.8
billion lire (dlrs 15 million).
	   AS Roma broke even.

Massive increases in fuel prices announced in Zimbabwe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The state oil company raised gasoline
prices by 67 percent Saturday, the largest single increase since
Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980.
	   The fuel price increases were expected to have a ripple effect
throughout the economy, further raising transportation fares and
delivery, manufacturing and food production costs. The action also
increases the likelihood of more unrest in this southern African
country, whose economy is already tottering under high inflation
and the depreciation of Zimbabwe's currency.
	   The National Oil Company, responsible for importing all the
nation's petroleum products that are distributed by private gas
stations, said an 80 percent slide in the Zimbabwe currency against
the U.S. dollar forced the increase.
	   Gasoline went up at midnight by 67 percent to 9.67 Zimbabwe
dollars (U.S. dlrs 0.26) a liter (U.S. dlrs 1.17 a gallon) and the
price of diesel fuel rose by 68 percent to 8.10 Zimbabwe dollars
(U.S. dlrs 0.22) a liter (U.S. dlrs 0.99 a gallon).
	   The price of kerosene, widely used for lighting, cooking and
heating by the poor, rose by 345 percent to 8.11 Zimbabwe dollars
(U.S. dlrs 0.22) a liter (U.S. dlrs 0.99 a gallon).
	   The oil company justified the massive increase by saying the
price of kerosene had not been increased on several occasions in
the past when other fuel prices rose.
	   Aviation fuel went up by 43 percent and petroleum gas by 24
percent.
	   In recent months, the price of Zimbabwe's staple food, corn
meal, has risen by 40 percent. Earlier this month, bread prices
rose by more than 30 percent.
	   The depreciation of the Zimbabwe currency has been blamed on
poor economic management, foreign and domestic speculation and the
impact of the decline in Asian economies on developing countries.
	   Earlier this year, six people were killed in the nation's first
food riots, triggered by a 25 percent hikes in food prices.

Iraq breaks off dealings with U.N. Special Commission

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a move that could provoke a showdown
with the United Nations, Iraq announced Saturday it would no longer
allow U.N. weapons inspectors to work in the country.
	   The decision by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his top
advisers exempted only a handful of experts from the International
Atomic Energy Agency, who monitor suspected nuclear sites.
	   The move was seen as a response to a U.N. Security Council
decision Friday to review Iraq's progress on eliminating prohibited
weapons.
	   Although it pledged a ``comprehensive review,'' the council did
not accede to Iraq's demand that the review lead directly to the
removal of the sweeping trade sanctions imposed in 1990 after
Baghdad's forces invaded Kuwait.
	   The Iraqi statement said the ban would continue ``until the
United Nations looks at the issue in an honest and positive way,
leading to Iraq's right to the lifting of the unjust sanctions.''
	   Iraq also insisted that the Security Council fire Richard
Butler, chief of the U.N. Special Commission that oversees weapons
inspections. Iraq has long charged that Butler is working on behalf
of the United States to prolong the sanctions.
	   It remained unclear if Saturday's decision would provoke the
United States and Britain to threaten military action against
Baghdad, as they did earlier this year after the Iraqi regime
prevented U.N. inspectors from entering Saddam's presidential
palaces.
	   In Washington, a spokesman for the National Security Council
said the body would meet later Saturday to discuss the matter.
	   ``We view this as a serious matter,'' said David Leavy. ``We are
currently consulting with allies and with officials at the United
Nations.''
	   In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said it ``deplores''
Iraq's decision. ``France insists that Iraq resume its full and
total cooperation with the United Nations,'' the statement added.
	   In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said on customary
condition of anonymity that such a ban would be ``totally
unacceptable.''
	   ``Iraq is again flouting the Security Council resolutions and
the memorandum of understanding it signed with the U.N. secretary
general.''
	   The British spokesman was referring to agreement signed in
February when U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan negotiated a
formula to allow the inspectors to enter the palaces. The
compromise defused the threat of air strikes, but the United States
still maintains considerable fire power in the Gulf.
	   Saddam Hussein's decision Saturday caused jitters in Baghdad.
Currency traders said the already depressed Iraqi dinar fell from
1660 to the dollar to 1760 from within minutes of the announcement.
	   Officials at the U.N. Special Commission in Baghdad declined to
take calls and issued no statements Saturday.
	   Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told reporters the
country would stand firm.
	   ``This is the decision of the people of Iraq and the leadership
of Iraq to save the sovereignty of Iraq and the right of the people
to live,'' Saleh said.
	   The sanctions have severely damaged the Iraqi economy by
limiting the sale of oil, banning air travel and prohibiting most
other financial dealings with Iraq.
	   Saturday's decision deepens a dispute that began Aug. 5, when
Iraq announced that teams from the special commission and the
atomic agency could no longer carry out spot inspections. But Iraq
allowed both groups to continue long-term monitoring _ often done
with cameras and sensors _ at previously identified weapons sites.
	   Now the commission must ``stop all their activities inside
Iraq'' aimed at destroying biological and chemical weapons and
long-range missiles, the statement said. Atomic agency monitors,
however, will be allowed to continue working.
	   There currently are about 120 monitors and U.N. support staff in
Baghdad.
	   The statement insisted that Iraq has ``complied with all related
resolutions'' of the Security Council. It blamed ``America and its
agents'' for blocking the lifting of sanctions.
	   ``Iraq was disappointed because lifting of the sanctions didn't
go in a normal fashion,'' the statement said. It added that the
Security Council decision Friday had been made under ``clear
pressure from America.''
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until the special commission
certifies that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq insists it has done so, but the commission alleges that
Baghdad continues to hide information on weapons, especially those
with biological and chemical agents.

Krajicek upsets Sampras to reach final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS, UPDATES with more quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ No wonder Richard Krajicek likes
playing Pete Sampras. He usually beats the No. 1 in the world.
	   One of the few players with a winning record against Sampras,
Krajicek upset the top-ranked American again Saturday 6-7 (2-7),
6-4, 7-6 (7-5) to reach the final of the dlrs. 2.45 million
Eurocard Open.
	   ``I just somehow like to play him and his game suits me
somehow,'' Krajicek said his fifth victory in seven matches against
Sampras. The Dutchman has won their last three matches.
	   ``I enjoy playing him,'' said Krajicek, who feels Sampras has to
live up his ranking on the court. ``OK, show me. I feel good. I
think I can beat you and let's play.''
	   ``I am one of the few players that have the feeling that when
they step on the court that they can beat him,'' Krajicek said.
	   Krajicek, who won the title here in 1995, advanced to his second
consecutive final and will play 10th-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov for
the title.
	   Kafelnikov beat 12th-seeded Jonas Bjorkman 6-2, 7-5.
	   Krajicek used his overpowering serve to beat Sampras and bolster
his chances of qualifying for the season-ending World Championship
next month in Hanover, Germany. Two spots remain open in the
eight-man field.
	   ``The key was how well I returned his second serve and I wasn't
good enough, I didn't put enough pressure,'' Sampras said. ``When
he is on, he is very devastating.''
	   Wimbledon champion in 1996 and ranked No. 11 in the world,
Krajicek saved a set point in the opening set with a couple of good
serves and Sampras then fought off two break points to force a
tiebreaker. A cross-court forehand winner gave him the set.
	   Sampras saved two set points in the second, hitting an ace on
one of them. Going for a big second serve, he hit it just a bit
long for his third double-fault of the game to give Krajicek the
second set.
	   ``I was going for big second serves the entire match and I
pushed some long,'' Sampras said. ``I got tight.''
	   ``It's a tough one to take at this point. I'll have to try to
regroup,'' Sampras said. ``He seems to play with no fear against
me.''
	   The American had another double-fault in the decisive tiebreaker
to fall down 4-2 and he never recovered.
	   Krajicek hit an ace to gain three match points. Sampras saved
the first two with service winners but the Dutchman clinched the
match with a volley on the next.
	   ``It's very frustrating, I felt I was playing very well this
week and had a chance to win this tournament,'' said Sampras,
winner of 11 Grand Slam titles, one short of Roy Emerson's record.
	   Sampras is assured of keeping his top ranking at least through
next week's Paris indoor tournament and the battle for No. 1 is
unlikely to be settled until Hanover.
	   But the loss could make it more difficult for Sampras to become
the first player to finish as No. 1 for six years in a row.
	   Kafelnikov had walkover in the quarterfinals when Marcelo Rios
dropped out with an injury.
	   ``I was fresh, I was eager. I knew I had a chance to win over
Jonas,'' said Kafelnikov, who is now 4-0 against Bjorkman.

Eiffel Tower closed as workers go on strike

	   PARIS (AP) _ Tourists hoping to peer at Paris on Saturday
through fog and rain from atop the Eiffel Tower were grounded after
workers went on strike to demand more staff.
	   ``The Eiffel Tower is closed. Strike,'' read large blue panels
in French and English on the tower.
	   The strike began late Friday and is expected to last until
Monday at least.
	   Eiffel Tower management have announced plans to recruit 25 new
staff, but workers are demanding 32 in total. The new jobs are part
of a nationwide plan to shorten the work week to 35 hours to spread
jobs around and reduce double-digit unemployment.
	   Management said Saturday they were in no mood to give in to the
strikers, calling them ``hostage takers.''
	   ``The strikers refused this morning to accept our proposal for
talks,'' said Eiffel Tower official Hugues de Bailliencourt. ``For
us there's no question of ceding to blackmail.''
	   Between 15,000 and 20,000 tourists visit the Eiffel Tower daily,
making it one of the most popular destinations in the world.
	   The company is expected to lose around 2.5 million francs (dlrs
417,000) over the weekend due to the strike.

More Americans joining Kosovo observer mission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With Western powers trying to get a
2,000-member verification mission started in Kosovo, a U.S.
official said dozens more Americans would start arriving Saturday.
	   Richard Huckaby, spokesman for the U.S. portion of the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission, known as KDOM, said 13 Americans were
expected in Pristina on Saturday and another 70 would come by the
middle of next week.
	   The new arrivals would join 48 Americans working for KDOM,
Huckaby said.
	   Also Saturday, Julia Taft, the U.S. assistant secretary of
state, was expected in Pristina to start a trip that would include
visiting villages and meeting with relief and refugee agencies.
	   The United States has led the Western effort to pressure
Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic to halt a seven-month
crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people have died in fighting that sent an estimated
300,000 people fleeing as refugees in the troubled southern Serbian
province where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-1.
	   Under the threat of NATO airstrikes, Milosevic agreed to
withdraw troops and police he sent into Kosovo when he launched the
crackdown in February and to allow relief agencies full access to
refugees.
	   The agreement he reached with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke also
called for the 2,000-member observer mission run by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to verify
Milosevic's compliance.
	   Many of the observers now working for KDOM are expected to
become verifiers in the OSCE mission, which is still setting up its
headquarters in Pristina.
	   ``Gradually we are going to be under the umbrella of OSCE but
the schedule and details are still being decided,'' Huckaby said.
	   Russia, Germany, France, Italy and Britain will each provide
about 200 people, Melissa Fleming, a spokeswoman at OSCE
headquarters in Vienna, Austria, said Wednesday.
	   Other nations, including the former Soviet bloc states of
Romania and Czech Republic, also have offered personnel. The
overall number of contributing nations was not yet known.
	   Norway has promised dlrs 26 million to cover costs of security,
housing and communications for the first year.
	   An OSCE spokesman has said the mission is still at least a few
days away from bringing in its first observers to work in the
field.
	   Kosovo's main ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, on Friday
urged the United States and Europe to speed up the verification
mission because large numbers of Serb forces remain in Kosovo.
	   The Serb police and Yugoslav soldiers continue to maintain a
visible presence in many areas of the province. A few police
checkpoints continue operating near strongholds of the ethnic
Albanian guerrilla movement, the Kosovo Liberation Army, and police
vehicles still regularly patrol some regions.
	   Most of the estimated 50,000 refugees who had been living in the
woods of Kosovo are believed to have moved to villages, and
thousands of refugees have returned to their homes. But the
continued police and military presence in some areas scares others
from going back.

West Indies beats India by six runs in Wills Cup semifinal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS : UPDATES with end of play. No pick up. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHANDRA BANERJEE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ On a day of huge hitting, West Indies
easily beat India by six wickets Saturday to set up a final with
South Africa in the Wills International Cup.
	   Ending his poor form, West Indian captain Brian Lara scored his
37th career fifty assisted by an unbeaten 48 by Keith Arthurton
taking their team past India's 242 to win the 50-overs game with
three overs to spare.
	   West Indian bowler Merv Dillon was declared man of the match.
	   India's bowling lost direction midway through the match as
captain Mohammad Azharuddin gave the ball to Rahul Dravid, who took
over the unfamiliar role of off-spinner, rather than Saurav Ganguly
and Ajay Jadeja who are regular fill-ins.
	   Only Sunil Joshi, Anil Kumble and Sachin Tendulkar completed
their quota of 10 overs each.
	   The match began with a smash for West Indies with opener Philo
Wallace slamming the first ball, bowled by Javagal Srinath, for a
six. Wallace scored 39 off 45 balls and with Shivnaraine
Chanderpaul put up the West Indian 100 in just 15 overs.
	   Chanderpaul scored a run-a-ball 74 including 10 fours and a six.
	   Earlier, a stroke-filled 83 by Saurav Ganguly and a hurricane 73
by Robin Singh helped India reach 242 for 6 wickets.
	   Singh battered West Indian bowlers in the last lap of the Indian
innings in the 63 balls he played, helping prop up his team's score
which tottered after a string of dismissals.
	   India lost its anchor batsman Sachin Tendulkar with just 14 runs
off the board, when he was caught brilliantly by Carl Hooper in the
slips on a personal score of just eight runs.
	   Another setback followed when Indian captain Mohammad Azharuddin
was trapped leg before on a delivery from Dillon that sharply
dipped in and caught the batsman on the back foot.
	   Ganguly and Rahul Dravid then repaired the damage, punishing
spinners Hooper and Keith Arthurton.
	   But Ganguly threw away his wicket at 83 when he unnecessarily
stepped out to a wide ball from leg spinner Rawl Lewis and was
stumped, 17 runs away from what would have been his fifth one-day
century. Ganguly hit eight fours and two huge sixes.
	   Dravid and Ajay Jadeja then left in quick succession, but Singh
took charge with some huge hits, including three sixes of which two
came off successive balls.

More Americans joining Kosovo observer mission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With Western powers trying to get a
2,000-member verification mission started in Kosovo, a U.S.
official said dozens more Americans would start arriving Saturday.
	   Richard Huckaby, spokesman for the U.S. portion of the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission, known as KDOM, said 13 Americans were
expected in Pristina on Saturday and another 70 would come by the
middle of next week.
	   The new arrivals join 48 Americans working for KDOM, Huckaby
said.
	   The ultimate makeup of the verification mission isn't known, as
it is still being assembled, but the OSCE has said that Russia,
Germany, France, Italy and Britain will each provide about 200
people.
	   Other nations, including the former Soviet bloc states of
Romania and Czech Republic, have offered personnel. The overall
number of contributing nations was not yet known. Norway has
promised dlrs 26 million for security, housing and communications
for the first year.
	   Also Saturday, assistant U.S. Secretary of State Julia Taft was
expected in Pristina to start a trip that was to include visiting
villages and meeting with relief and refugee agencies.
	   The United States has led the Western effort to pressure
Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic to halt a seven-month
crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people have died in fighting that sent an estimated
300,000 people fleeing as refugees in the troubled southern Serbian
province where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9 to 1. Serbia is
the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Under the threat of NATO airstrikes, Milosevic agreed to
withdraw troops and police he sent into Kosovo when he launched the
crackdown in February, and to allow relief agencies full access to
refugees.
	   The agreement he reached with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke also
called for the 2,000-member observer mission run by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to verify
Milosevic's compliance.
	   Many of the observers now working for KDOM are expected to
become verifiers in the OSCE mission, which is still setting up its
headquarters in Pristina, the provincial capital.
	   ``Gradually we are going to be under the umbrella of OSCE but
the schedule and details are still being decided,'' Huckaby said
	   An OSCE spokesman has said the mission is still at least a few
days away from bringing in its first observers to work in the
field.
	   Kosovo's main ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, on Friday
urged the United States and Europe to speed up the verification
mission because large numbers of Serb forces remain in Kosovo.
	   The Serb police and Yugoslav soldiers continue to maintain a
visible presence in many areas of the province. A few police
checkpoints continue operating near strongholds of the ethnic
Albanian guerrilla movement, the Kosovo Liberation Army, and police
vehicles still regularly patrol some regions.
	   Most of the estimated 50,000 refugees who had been living in the
woods of Kosovo are believed to have moved to villages, and
thousands of refugees have returned to their homes. But the
continued police and military presence in some areas scares others
from going back.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a move that could provoke a showdown
with the United Nations, Iraq announced Saturday it would no longer
allow U.N. weapons inspectors to work in the country.
	   The decision by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his top
advisers exempted only a handful of experts from the International
Atomic Energy Agency, who monitor suspected nuclear sites.
	   The move was seen as a response to a U.N. Security Council
decision Friday to review Iraq's progress on eliminating prohibited
weapons.
	   Although it pledged a ``comprehensive review,'' the council did
not accede to Iraq's demand that the review lead directly to the
removal of the sweeping trade sanctions imposed in 1990 after
Baghdad's forces invaded Kuwait.
	   The Iraqi statement said the ban would continue ``until the
United Nations looks at the issue in an honest and positive way,
leading to Iraq's right to the lifting of the unjust sanctions.''
	   Iraq also insisted that the Security Council fire Richard
Butler, chief of the U.N. Special Commission that oversees weapons
inspections. Iraq has long charged that Butler is working on behalf
of the United States to prolong the sanctions.
	   It remained unclear if Saturday's decision would provoke the
United States and Britain to threaten military action against
Baghdad, as they did earlier this year after the Iraqi regime
prevented U.N. inspectors from entering Saddam's presidential
palaces.
	   In Washington, a spokesman for the National Security Council
said the body would meet later Saturday to discuss the matter.
	   ``We view this as a serious matter,'' said David Leavy. ``We are
currently consulting with allies and with officials at the United
Nations.''
	   In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said it ``deplores''
Iraq's decision. ``France insists that Iraq resume its full and
total cooperation with the United Nations,'' the statement added.
	   In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said on customary
condition of anonymity that such a ban would be ``totally
unacceptable.''
	   ``Iraq is again flouting the Security Council resolutions and
the memorandum of understanding it signed with the U.N. secretary
general.''
	   The British spokesman was referring to agreement signed in
February when U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan negotiated a
formula to allow the inspectors to enter the palaces. The
compromise defused the threat of air strikes, but the United States
still maintains considerable fire power in the Gulf.
	   Saddam Hussein's decision Saturday caused jitters in Baghdad.
Currency traders said the already depressed Iraqi dinar fell from
1660 to the dollar to 1760 from within minutes of the announcement.
	   Officials at the U.N. Special Commission in Baghdad declined to
take calls and issued no statements Saturday.
	   Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told reporters the
country would stand firm.
	   ``This is the decision of the people of Iraq and the leadership
of Iraq to save the sovereignty of Iraq and the right of the people
to live,'' Saleh said.
	   The Iraqi Information Ministry issued a statement late Saturday
saying the government was not asking the roughly 120 U.N. monitors
and support staff to leave Iraq. It added that the monitoring
cameras and sensors installed at weapons sites could continue to
operate.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   United Nations disarmament experts have been searching for
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq under U.N. resolutions that
ended the 1991 Gulf War. The United Nations and Iraq have often

inspections and demands they leave in one week, accusing them of
spying. The Security Council calls ban ``unacceptable.''

American by failing to provide the escorts needed to enter
suspected weapons sites.
	   Jan. 20 _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector says he was unable to
persuade Baghdad to open presidential palaces to arms monitors.
	   Jan. 27 _ Clinton intensifies U.S. pressure on Iraq to open all
sites, warning Saddam Hussein not to ``defy the will of the
world.''
	   Feb. 4 _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright returns to
Washington after a six-day tour of Gulf and Middle East, saying
support for U.S. position had grown.
	   Feb. 23 _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan secures deal with
President Saddam Hussein to open presidential palaces for
inspection.

removal of the sweeping trade sanctions imposed in 1990 after
Baghdad's forces invaded Kuwait.
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until the Special Commission
certifies that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq insists it has done so, but the commission says Baghdad
continues to hide information on weapons, especially those with
biological and chemical agents.
	   The Iraqi statement said the ban would continue ``until the
United Nations looks at the issue in an honest and positive way,
leading to Iraq's right to the lifting of the unjust sanctions.''
	   Iraq also insisted that the Security Council fire Richard

the country would stand firm.
	   ``This is the decision of the people of Iraq and the leadership
of Iraq to save the sovereignty of Iraq and the right of the people
to live,'' Saleh said.
	   The sanctions have severely damaged the Iraqi economy by
limiting the sale of oil, banning air travel and prohibiting most
other financial dealings with Iraq.
	   Saturday's decision deepens a dispute that began Aug. 5, when
Iraq announced that teams from the Special Commission and the
atomic agency could no longer carry out spot inspections. But Iraq
allowed both groups to continue long-term monitoring, often done
with cameras and sensors, at previously identified weapons sites.
	   Now the commission must ``stop all their activities inside
Iraq'' that relate to destroying biological and chemical weapons
and long-range missiles, the statement said. Atomic agency
monitors, however, will be allowed to continue working.
	   The Iraqi Information Ministry issued a statement late Saturday
saying the government was not asking the roughly 120 U.N. monitors

Havel clashes with Klaus in a radio duel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAN SLIVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel
clashed with Parliament Speaker Vaclav Klaus in a rare radio duel
Saturday, disputing over the role of the state in society and
events which led to the fall of Klaus' Cabinet last November.
	   ``Our differences are of a deep, philosophical-ideological
character,'' Klaus said the debate, their first in years, which was
broadcast on Czech public radio.
	   While Klaus, the country's former premier, advocated liberalism
and a market economy, Havel spoke in favor of a greater role of the
state.
	   ``The state should show solidarity with people,'' he said.
	   Havel again criticized Klaus for failing to introduce what he
called an adequate legal framework for privatization, while the
former premier reproached Havel for insuffiecient support of his
center-right Cabinet.
	   ``I didn't have a feeling that the president would particularly
support us,'' he said.
	   The two politicians also argued over the role of the president's
office in Czech politics.
	   While Klaus said Havel's office ``pursues certain political
interests of its own,'' the president insisted that there was no
such thing as ``the policy of the Castle,'' a reference to Prague
Castle housing the president's offices.
	   Havel, the moral authority who led Czechs out of decades of
communism, has been vying with Klaus, the architect of one of the
most stable post-Communist economies, for the public's ear since
Communist rule collapsed in 1989.
	   Last Novemeber, Klaus was accused of accepting questionable
party donations and subsequently forced out of the office.
	   Addressing legislators days later, Havel painted a grim picture
of a society denying people a real voice, where it ``pays off to
lie and steal.'' That speech deepened the rift between Havel and
Klaus.
	   Havel, 62, fought off a life-threatening case of pneumonia in
August and had an emergency surgery for a ruptured colon in April.
	   After his visit to the United States last month, followed by
weeks of a busy program at home, Havel looked tired and had
breathing difficulties, resulting from his chronic bronchitis.
	   But his condition has improved after several days of resting at
his residence in Lany outside Prague.

Man U wins 4-1 at Everton; Chelsea-Villa game called off
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Manchester United charged to within one point of
Aston Villa at the top of the Premier League Saturday with a 4-1
win at Everton.
	   With Villa's game at Chelsea called off because heavy rain had
left the Stamford Bridge field waterlogged, United, which had a
game in hand, overpowered Everton at Goodison Park with goals from
Dwight Yorke, Andy Cole and Jesper Blomqvist with an own goal
contribution by Toffees' defender Craig Short.
	   Defending titlist Arsenal won 1-0 at Arsenal through a goal by
Nicolas Anelka to stay well in contention in third place. But there
was tragedy at Highfield Road when a Coventry security guard was
killed when he was hit by the Arsenal team bus as it arrived at the
stadium. Police said his head and chest were crushed against a
fence.
	   After Saturday's games, Villa has 22 points from 10 games and
United has 21 while Arsenal have 20 from 11.
	   Tony Cottee's fourth goal in a week earned Leicester a 1-0
victory over fourth place Liverpool. Middlesbrough can replace
Liverpool by beating Nottingham Forest on Sunday.
	   Michael Owen, who scored four goals against Forest last week,
was kept quiet by the well-organized Leicester defense and
Liverpool wasn't helped by the expulsion of Irish international
Jason McAteer.
	   Another veteran striker, Ian Wright, scored twice as West Ham
gained a 3-0 win at Ruud Gullit's Newcastle, which had England
defender Stuart Pearce expelled for elbowing Trevor Sinclair in the
back.
	   Derby and Leeds fought out a 2-2 tie at Pride Park. Stefan
Schnoor's third minutes penalty put Derby ahead before Leeds' Dutch
defender Robert Molenaar, who had conceded it, leveled with a
header. Leeds' Australian forward Harry Kewell put his team ahead
with a deflected shot before Dean Sturridge salvaged a point for
the home team.
	   Southampton gained a 0-0 tie at Sheffield Wednesday but remains
last with six points, two fewer than Coventry and Forest. Blackburn
earned a point from a 1-1 tie with Wimbledon, Chris Sutton's
penalty putting Rovers ahead but Marcus Gayle leveling for the home
team.
	   Zimbabwean forward Peter Ndlovu fired Birmingham City to the top
of division one in a 1-1 tie with Huddersfield but was then
expelled for his second yellow card.
	   Birmingham moved ahead of Sunderland by one point but Peter
Reid's team has three games in hand and can replace the Blues by
winning at Bolton on Sunday.
	   Chinese international defender Fan Zhiyi was one of two Crystal
Palace player sent off in the 2-0 loss at Grimsby.
	   Glasgow Rangers stayed top of the Scottish Premier League by
beating Dundee United 2-1 but after falling behind to a Billy Dodds
goal.
	   Rod Wallace leveled and Italian defender Lorenzo Amoruso hit the
Rangers winner six minutes from the end.
	   Goals by Mark Roberts and Ally Mitchell gave Kilmarnock a 2-0
victory over third place Celtic to keep Killie in second. Celtic's
Stephane Mahe was sent off for a second yellow card.

Inter leads list of big money losers among Italian clubs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ronaldo quote, background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Ronaldo, hoping to stick with Internazionale
of Milan for a long spell, says he wants to be a shareholder of the
club, which just happened to post the largest loss among Italian
Serie A soccer clubs for the 1997-98 fiscal year.
	   The club on Saturday reported a 44.8 billion lire (dlrs 27.1
million) deficit, more than double the previous year's.
	   ``We are glad to welcome Ronaldo among the club shareholders,''
said oil industrialist Massimo Moratti, who last year engineered
the costly transfer of the Brazilian striker from Barcelona.
	   Moratti, who holds a controlling stake in the club, said he was
going to sell Ronaldo an undisclosed amount of shares from his own
stake.
	   ``I want to become an Inter shareholder because I want to stay
with this team for a long time,'' Ronaldo said at Inter's training
camp.
	   ``Inter is the club which trusted me, which left me tranquil,''
said the striker, who is a questionable starter in Sunday's league
match with Bari because of a light touch of the flu and tendinitis
of the knee.
	   Most Italian soccer clubs are seeking quotation on the Milan
stock market.
	   Lazio, the only Italian club officially listed so far, posted a
profit of 6.5 billion lire (dlrs 3.9 million) in the last fiscal
year despite the costly purchase of star-forwards Marcelo Salas and
Christian Vieri.
	   Lazio's owner Sergio Cragnotti promised a better profit next
year as a result of higher televsion rights and sales from
merchandising.
	   Juventus of Turin, which is owned by the Agnelli family of auto
tycoons, posted a profit of 16.3 billion lire (dlrs 9.8 million),
taking advantage of a surplus from the transfer campaign.
	   Like its crosstown rival Inter, AC Milan, the club of media
tycoon and former premier Silvio Berlusconi posted a loss, of 24.8
billion lire (dlrs 15 million).
	   AS Roma broke even.

Iran starts major war games on Afghanistan border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran began Saturday major military exercises
on its border with Afghanistan, state-run radio reported.
	   The radio did not say how many troops were involved, but the
commander of Iranian ground forces, Brig. Gen. Abdolali Pourshasd,
has said about 200,000 troops would take part.
	   The maneuvers began with a night attack by a division of troops
acting as an enemy, the radio said.
	   The exercises _ called Zolfaqar-2 after the sword of Imam Ali,
the son-in-law of Islam's Prophet Mohammed _ are taking place
against a background of tension with Afghanistan.
	   Iranian-Afghan relations deteriorated sharply in September after
the Taliban militia, which controls most of Afghanistan, admitted
that its forces had killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist
in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   But the situation improved in early October after the
intervention of U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, who shuttled
between Tehran and Kabul and secured the release of 26 Iranians
held captive in Afghanistan.
	   The radio did not say how long the maneuvers would last.

Iran starts major war games on Afghanistan border

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran began Saturday major military exercises
on its border with Afghanistan, state-run radio reported.
	   The radio did not say how many troops were involved, but the
commander of Iranian ground forces, Brig. Gen. Abdolali Pourshasd,
has said about 200,000 troops would take part.
	   The maneuvers began with a night attack by a division of troops
acting as an enemy, the radio said.
	   The exercises _ called Zolfaqar-2 after the sword of Imam Ali,
the son-in-law of Islam's Prophet Mohammed _ are taking place
against a background of tension with Afghanistan.
	   Iranian-Afghan relations deteriorated sharply in September after
the Taliban militia, which controls most of Afghanistan, admitted
that its forces had killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist
in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   But the situation improved in early October after the
intervention of U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, who shuttled
between Tehran and Kabul and secured the release of 26 Iranians
held captive in Afghanistan.
	   The radio did not say how long the maneuvers would last.

Arsenal bus kills security man
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COVENTRY, England (AP) _ Tragedy struck the Coventry City vs.
Arsenal Premier League game Saturday when the bus arriving at
Highfield Road with the Arsenal players struck and killed a
security guard.
	   Police said the man died of head and chest injuries caused when
the bus, carrying the Arsenal players into the stadium complex,
crushed him against a fence.
	   Superintendent Bob Minshull said the incident happened about an
hour before kickoff.
	   ``Although the players were on the coach, it does not appear
they were aware of exactly what happened or at least the
seriousness of what happened,'' Minshull said.
	   Arsenal, the Premier League defending champion, won the game 1-0
to stay third in the standings behind Aston Villa and Manchester
United.

Schroeder calls for rate cut; new bank president reportedly picked
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Schroeder calls for interest
rate cuts &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Just days after chastising his finance
minister for criticizing Germany's central bank, Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder went after the bankers himself Saturday, calling for more
focus on stimulating economic growth.
	   ``We want to create a consensus and not lead a fight'' with the
bank, Schroeder said at a trade union congress in Duisburg.
	   ``My request is that all instruments be used to allow the
economy to grow, ... that these institutions understand their
responsibility not only for monetary stability, but also for
reasonably managed economic growth.''
	   New Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine has repeatedly advocated
interest rate cuts to spur the economy and help reduce Germany's
high unemployment rate. But his calls have so far been ignored by
the fiercely independent central bank, or Bundesbank.
	   In a television interview Thursday, Schroeder criticized
Lafontaine's approach, saying: ``One must talk with the Bundesbank,
but not publicly.''
	   Yet on Saturday, Schroeder himself pointed out that when setting
interest rates, the Bundesbank was required by law not only to
consider their impact on inflation and monetary stability, but also
on economic growth.
	   German inflation is roughly 1 percent, while unemployment is
more than 10 percent.
	   Schroeder stressed both he and Lafontaine respect the
Bundesbank's independence.
	   Yet Der Spiegel newsmagazine reported Saturday that Lafontaine
has already chosen a more like-minded candidate to replace
Bundesbank chief Hans Tietmeyer next year.
	   The magazine said Lafontaine wanted Ernst Welteke, the head of
the central bank in Hesse state and a fellow Social Democrat, in
the post as his advocate for more flexibility in setting monetary
policy.
	   Welteke, 56, is considered less of an anti-inflation hardliner
when it comes to setting interest rates than Tietmeyer, who will
retire next year when he turns 68.
	   The Finance Ministry labeled the report ``pure speculation'' and
said the decision had not yet been made.
	   The Bundesbank cedes power next year to the new European Central
Bank, which will set monetary policy for all European Union
countries joining monetary union on Jan. 1.
	   Welteke would then be one of two German representatives with the
European bank, the other being director Otmar Issig, who favors a
strict anti-inflationary approach to monetary policy.
	   Lafontaine also wants to sit in on the Bundesbank's council
meeting Thursday in Frankfurt. ``Naturally I invited him,'' the
magazine quoted current Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer as
saying.

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Two days after carmaker Opel opened a new factory
in Poland, Volkswagen said Saturday it also is planning to build
cars there.
	   The Welt am Sonntag newspaper said VW plans to invest 350
million marks (dlrs 220 million) on the Polish plant, which will
initially produce the VW Polo and Skoda Octavia, mainly for eastern
European markets.
	   VW currently assembles cars in Poznan from kits to avoid high
Polish import taxes, the newspaper said.
	   A VW spokesman confirmed a factory was planned for Poznan, in
western Poland. But he refused to comment further until the final
decision is made, probably by the end of the year.
	   Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors, opened a new
factory in Gliwice, Poland, last Thursday.

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Forensic experts examining heavily
burned bodies were able Saturday to identify more of the 60 young
people who died in a dance hall fire, but the catastrophe's most
tormenting question was still unanswered.
	   How could it happen; what caused the flames that raced through a
hall packed far beyond capacity, blocking one of the exits and
forcing panicked teen-agers to flee down the one remaining
staircase and leap out of second-story windows?
	   ''As long as the technicians haven't established the cause of
the fire, we don't know if it's arson or not,'' Goteborg chief
prosecutor Ulf Noren said Saturday evening.
	   Earlier in the day, Noren had said it was a ''50-50'' chance
that the fire was arson, prompting wide speculation that
authorities had tracked down new clues. But Noren later retracted
the remark, saying he'd meant only that no possibilities were being
excluded.
	   As investigators worked to find the cause, examiners identified
another 22 of the bodies, bringing the total to 40, and officials
said 49 people were released from hospital.
	   Of the 162 people who suffered non-fatal injuries in the
Thursday night fire, 76 remain hospitalized. Most of the victims
were immigrants or of immigrant parentage, from countries including
Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Ethiopia and current and former Yugoslavia.
	   The first call alerting authorities to the fire was made in
heavily accented Swedish and that, combined with noise and the
caller's distress, delayed the fire squads' response by several
minutes.
	   Per-Olof Ortarsen of Goteborg's emergency services line said the
call was so hard to understand that it took three minutes for
workers to figure out what was going on and where to send fire
trucks.
	   The first fire trucks and rescue squads were on the scene six
minutes after the call was received, Ortarsen told a news
conference. He and other officials declined to comment on whether a
quicker response could have saved any of the mostly immigrant
victims.
	   But the minutes of delay felt endless to those caught in the
terror of the fire and survivors have spoken angrily of what they
saw as a slow and even obstructive response.
	   ``No help. No police. No firemen,'' 17-year-old Zuhir Hersi, one
of the disc jockeys at the bash said Friday, hours after the blaze
exploded. ``Just kids helping kids.''
	   And once the squads arrived, the kids were then blocked from
helping, they say.
	   ``We could have saved more young people if only police hadn't
stopped us,'' Mohanned Hussein was quoted as saying by the
newspaper Expressen.
	   On Saturday, hundreds of people stood quietly outside the gutted
building amid flowers and candles as they attempted to come to
grips with catastrophe.
	   In the parking lot that a day before had been a tumult of
ambulances and screams, mourners had laid a 30-meter-long
(100-foot-long) pile of bouquets, candles and cards of remembrance.
	   The cards' inscriptions were brief _ ``I will see you in
heaven,'' ``We miss you'' _ and the people who stood reading them
also had few words.
	   ``I just wanted to show my sympathy. I think about them. There's
nothing else we can do,'' said Caroline Ericsson, who didn't know
any of the fire's victims.
	   ''It's damn difficult,'' said Connie Mesfin, who said she lost a
friend in the blaze.
	   Lasse Gustafsson, a former Goteborg firefighter severely
disfigured in an explosion, also came to the club site to try to
show the victims' relatives and friends that spirit can help them
pull through despair.
	   ``I can't give them hope. Consolation is enough,'' he said, as
people nearby cast uneasy glances at his scars.
	   Many of those injured in the blaze may have to endure similar
shocked looks the rest of their lives. Authorities say the
explosive fire quickly raised the temperature in the hall to 600
degrees (1,100 F).
	   The hall was packed far beyond its capacity. Licensed to hold a
maximum of 150, the hall held at least 250 and perhaps as many as
400 when the fire hit.
	   One of the two exit stairways was blocked by fire and there were
conflicting statements from witnesses as to whether the fire came
up the stairs from a lower level, or whether it spread there after
breaking out in the second-floor rooms.
	   The worst previous fire disaster in modern Sweden was in 1978 in
Boraas, when 20 people died in a hotel fire. Goteborg, Sweden's
second-largest city with about 435,000 people, is 500 kilometers
(300 miles) southwest of Stockholm.

Mexican retains WBA lightweight title

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Javier Velardez of Mexico has retained his WBA
lightweight title by stopping Chris Linson on a technical knockout
in the 10th round of their 12-round scheduled fight at the New
Orleans Hotel and Casino.
	   Pedro Ortega of Mexico won the vacant WBA North American junior
middleweight title Friday night by halting Floyd Weaver of the
United States, by TKO in the 12th round.
	   Velardez, 56 1-2 kilograms (125 pounds), survived a second-round
knockout and a surge by Linson in the middle rounds before stopping
the challenger at 2:44 of the 10th round.
	   Valardez, who was trailing on all three judge's cards, hurt
Linson, of the United States, late in the 10th with a right to the
head. He followed with a barrage of blows to the head until the
referee stopped the fight. Linson, 61 kilos (135 pounds), fell to
15-2 with one draw and 11 knockouts.
	   Ortega, 70 kilos (154 pounds), dominated his bout before finally
finishing off the 69 kilos (153 1-2-pound) Weaver. Ortega improved
to 17-1 with 16 knockouts, while Weaver dropped to 15-6 with three
draws and 10 knockouts.

Bazan retains WBC lightweight title with majority decision
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cesar Bazan of Mexico kept his WBC
lightweight title Friday night with a tough majority decision over
countryman Mauro Lucero, who had dropped from the super lightweight
class for the fight.
	   Bazan stung Lucero several times in the early rounds, but the
challenger held his ground as the fight went on and often was the
aggressor, squeezing in tight to limit Bazan's reach advantage.
	   But while Lucero landed punches, none seemed to stun the
champion and the fighters spent much of the last six rounds
entwined, often wobbling into the ropes in a clumsy embrace.
	   Bazan, who won his title June 13 with a victory over Stevie
Johnston, was favored 116-112 and 115-114 on two cards with the
third even at 115-115.
	   Bazan, making his second defense of the title, improved to 34-2
with one draw 23 knockouts. Lucero, the WBC's 10th-ranked super
lightweight, fell to 32-4 with 1 draw and 20 knockouts.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet may
not vote on the latest Mideast peace deal in time to meet its
Monday starting date.
	   Netanyahu's Cabinet convenes Sunday but the premier said he
would not show his ministers the agreement until the Palestinians
had submitted a security document on fighting terrorism. And
without his Cabinet's approval, the premier has said he would not
begin implementing the accord which calls for Israel to cede 13.1
percent of the West Bank to Palestinian control.
	   Still reeling from a suicide bombing attack in which 40 Israeli
children narrowly escaped death, Netanyahu said the Palestinian
Authority must arrest Mohammed Deif, a military leader of the
Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   ``Israel has a clear expectation ... that Deif will be arrested
within the next several days,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Cabinet approved the peace
accord Friday and said it would present its action plan on fighting
terrorism to the Americans as promised by Monday.
	   ``We are committed next week to sharing our security plan with
the Americans. This does not mean submitting the plan to Israel or
to anybody else,'' said senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   Saturday, Arafat said he would do everything in his power to
fight militants and curb terrorism.
	   ``As you know, there have been military, terrorist attacks. The
latest was aimed at a school bus,'' Arafat said. ``Thank God, an
armored jeep received the blow,'' and not the bus, Arafat said,
speaking to reporters in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
	   Hamas claimed responsibility for Thursday's attack, in which an
explosives-laden car drove towards a school bus before it was
blocked by a military escort jeep. An Israeli soldier was killed in
the attack but the children were unharmed.
	   Arafat's Authority government launched an aggressive campaign
against Hamas after the attack, placing its spiritual leader Sheik
Ahmed Yassin under house arrest and rounding-up over 100 activists.
An aide to Arafat also said the authority had discussed Netanyahu's
request to arrest Deif, who is considered to be behind several
deadly attacks against Israelis and has been hiding in Gaza for the
past three years.
	   But after the two-day sweep, Palestinian forces unexpectedly
released began releasing several militant leaders Saturday.
	   Ismail Hanieh, a senior Hamas activist was released after being
held two days. Reached by a reporter on his mobile phone, Hanieh
said he was out of jail and would not discuss his case.
	   A Palestinian police official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity said that Nafez Azam, a senior figure in the smaller
Palestinian Islamic Jihad group had also been released. A third man
who heads the National Islamic Salvation party was released.
	   The official gave no reason for the releases.
	   Israel has accused the Authority of a revolving-door policy of
rounding up militants and then releasing them without punishment.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser David Bar-Illan said Israel had
adopted ``wait and see attitude,'' to the arrests.
	   ``Let's see if it's the first step in a real battle against the
terrorist infrastructure or a repeat of the same maneuvers designed
to placate world opinion after terrorist bombings,'' Bar-Illan
said.
	   Under the new peace agreement, the Palestinians are obligated to
taking stronger measures against militants and their
infrastructure. Without concrete steps, Israel has said it would
not go through with its half of the agreement to cede more land to
Palestinian control.
	   Palestinian Communications Minister Imad Falouji, a former
member of Hamas, who voted against the new peace accord with
Israel, paid a visit to Yassin Saturday.
	   Falouji told The AP that Yassin was ready for serious dialogue
with the Palestinian Authority. Falouji did not give specific
details but said he would carry a message from the sheikh to
Arafat. Hamas opposes peace with Israel and has claimed
responsibility for killing scores of Israelis in deadly attacks
since peace-making began in 1993.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo Albanian political leaders
convened Saturday with the representative of their independence
movements's armed wing to look into ways of setting up an ethnic
Albanian authority in the Serbian province.
	   A delegation of the self-styled Kosovo parliament, loyal to the
chief ethnic Albanian political leader, Ibrahim Rugova, met in
Kosovo's capital Pristina with Adem Demaci, the representative of
the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Details of the talks were not immediately available except that
the Albanians in the meeting sought a ``better cooperation between
Kosovo Albanian political groups and the KLA'' and to coordinate
``activities toward establishing state bodies and executive power
in Kosovo'' which would serve ``the people's will for
independence.''
	   Fighting has stopped in Kosovo and a massive pullout of
government forces has taken place in the wake of an agreement
reached between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, coupled with threats of NATO airstrike if he
does not comply.
	   However, talks on a political settlement in the majority
Albanian province are yet to come.
	   The province's ethnic Albanians seek to set up their own
authorities in Kosovo. They already have underground Albanian-only
education and health care networks.
	   Their parliament, established earlier this year in officially
unrecognized elections, is dominated by Rugova's party, the
Democratic League of Kosovo, whose media office reported the
Saturday meeting.
	   On Friday, Rugova spoke for the first time publicly about the
KLA, saying its armed struggle was justified by Serbian
``oppression.''

Zadornov: Russia pays all federal wages for October
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government paid wages to all federal
employees in October, and gave the Pension Fund enough money to pay
all pensions for the first time in many months, the finance
minister said Saturday
	   ``In October, we stopped the growth of arrears,'' Mikhail
Zadornov said on Russian television.
	   The government's failure to pay wages and pensions for months at
a time has been one of the major issues facing Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, as it was for the previous two prime ministers.
	   Primakov recently promised that the government would pay off its
wage debts to state workers before the end of the year, and pay off
all military arrears by the end of January. He said pensions would
not be caught up until the end of 1999.
	   Zadornov said the government had not only paid current salaries,
but also paid 30 percent of the back wages it owed scientists,
teachers and doctors in October, and one-quarter of its debt to
students, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   It was not clear where the money had come from, although
Primakov has said he would authorize limited printing of new money
to pay off wage debts.
	   Zadornov said only that the government had given the Finance
Ministry ``resources ... not only to pay current wages and pensions
monthly, but also to pay arrears on them in November and
December.''
	   `The government has fulfilled its obligations because it
considers the payment of wages and pensions on a monthly basis as
its chief task,'' he added.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ Floodwaters rose to the third floor of
some buildings in the Honduran capital Saturday after Mitch was
downgraded to a tropical depression after killing at least 127
people in the region.
	   Dozens of houses in Tegucigalpa were washed away, seven of the
city's 10 bridges were knocked out and patients were evacuated from
the third floor of the Social Security hospital after the Rio
Grande River overflowed.
	   In the Caribbean, two U.S. Coast Guard C-130 planes continued
the search for a tourist schooner with 31 people aboard that hasn't
been heard from since Tuesday.
	   While tropical storm warnings were discontinued Saturday, states
of emergency remained in effect in Honduras and Nicaragua.
	   With rainfall of 4 inches (10 cms) an hour at the height of the
storm, downed bridges, rampant rivers, toppled trees and mudslides
isolated hundreds of communities where food, water and medicine
were in short supply.
	   ``Almost everything is damaged or destroyed and it will be
difficult to recover from such a tragedy,'' said Col. Anael Perez,
spokesman for Honduras' Permanent Emergency Commission, describing
the damage in his country of 6 million.
	   Failing communications prevented authorities from issuing damage
estimates or death tolls, but at least 127 were confirmed dead in
Honduras, Nicaragua and Mexico, and hundreds of thousands had fled
or lost their homes.
	   By early Saturday, Mitch's winds _ once near 180 mph _ had
dropped to 35 mph (55 kph) and the storm was located about 25 miles
(40 kms) south of Santa Rosa de Copan, Honduras, moving west at 7
mph (11 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center reported.
	   The Coast Guard reported that two Swiss citizens were rescued
from a life raft after their 33-foot yacht (10.5-meter) yacht went
down Monday in the Caribbean, but there was still no sign of the
258-foot (77-meter) schooner, the Fantome, missing since Tuesday.
	   ``There's still not a lot we can do with the way the weather is
down there,'' said Jeff Hall, spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard.
	   The Antigua-registered Fantome, once owned by Aristotle Onassis,
is operated out of Miami by Windjammer Barefoot Cruises.
	   After dropping its tourist passengers off in Belize on Monday,
the crew headed toward Roatan Island, off the north coast, to
escape the hurricane _ which for two days was centered near that
island.
	   In their last communication, the crew of the Fantome said they
were experiencing 100-knot winds and 40-degree rolls, said
Windjammer spokesman James Canty.
	   The ship carried an emergency transmitter, but no signal has
been received, the Coast Guard said.
	   In Tegucigalpa, the capital's airport was closed and more than
30,000 people had been evacuated. An equal number had already been
taken to shelters in the nation's second city, San Pedro Sula in
the north.
	   In small coastal communities near San Pedro Sula, troops and
firefighters moved in with boats to rescue people still clinging to
roofs.
	   Clara Bonilla, 31, spent the night in a school bus near San
Pedro Sula with her four children.
	   ``It got very cold in the night, and no one has given us much
help,'' Bonilla said, clutching her youngest daughter.

Chronology of Iraq's standoff over U.N. inspections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq-UN, BC-Iraq-UN-Statement &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   U.N. disarmament experts have been searching for weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq under U.N. resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf
War. The United Nations and Iraq have often clashed over access to
suspected sites and the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990
for its invasion of Kuwait.
	   Key dates in Iraq's standoff with U.N. inspectors:
	   Oct. 7, 1997 _ U.N. arms inspectors tell the Security Council
that Iraq still refuses to disclose full details of its banned
weapons programs and is imposing new restrictions on inspectors.
	   Oct. 29 _ Iraq announces it will bar Americans from weapons
inspections and demands they leave in one week, accusing them of
spying. The Security Council calls the ban ``unacceptable.''

authorities turn them back because they include Americans _ a scene
that is repeated in 10 of the next 11 days.
	   Nov. 12 _ Security Council adopts resolution condemning Iraq.
United States fails to get council agreement on a stronger warning
of possible military action.
	   Nov. 13 _ Iraq says American inspectors must leave immediately.

	   Nov. 14 _ U.S. President Bill Clinton orders aircraft carrier
USS George Washington to the Gulf.

inspectors to return immediately. Russia says it will work to have
the U.N. sanctions lifted.

suspected weapons sites.
	   Jan. 20 _ Butler says he was unable to persuade Baghdad to open
presidential palaces to arms monitors.
	   Jan. 27 _ Clinton intensifies U.S. pressure on Iraq to open all
sites, warning Iraqi President Saddam Hussein not to ``defy the
will of the world.''
	   Feb. 4 _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright returns to
Washington after a six-day tour of Gulf and Middle East states,
saying support for U.S. position had grown.
	   Feb. 23 _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan secures deal with
Saddam to open presidential palaces for inspection.
	   March 26 _ U.N. arms experts begin inspecting palaces.
	   May 1 _ Iraq warns the Security Council of ``grave
consequences'' if it does not lift sanctions.

agent, but says it was unable to turn it into a weapon.
	   June 24 _ Butler tells Security Council that U.S. Army tests
left ``no doubt'' that Iraq placed VX nerve gas in missile
warheads. Missile material sent to France and Switzerland for
further tests.

inspectors.
	   Aug. 9 _ U.N. experts suspend new arms inspections.

	   Aug. 25 _ Iraq asks United Nations to prevent Butler from making
public statements about search for weapons in Iraq.
	   Aug. 26 _ American Scott Ritter, a top U.N. weapons inspector,
resigns, saying the Security Council and United States have failed
to take a tougher stand against Iraq.
	   Aug. 31 _ Iraq accuses the U.N. Special Commission on Iraqi arms
inspections, called UNSCOM, of spying for the United States and
Israel, demands investigation.
	   Sept. 9 _ United Nations suspends periodic review of trade
sanctions on Iraq.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a move that could provoke a showdown
with the United Nations, Iraq announced Saturday it would no longer
allow U.N. weapons inspectors to work in the country.
	   The decision by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his top
advisers exempted only a handful of experts from the International
Atomic Energy Agency, who monitor suspected nuclear sites.
	   The move was seen as a response to a U.N. Security Council
decision Friday to review Iraq's progress on eliminating prohibited
weapons.
	   Although it pledged a ``comprehensive review,'' the council did
not accede to Iraq's demand that the review lead directly to the
removal of the sweeping trade sanctions imposed in 1990 after
Baghdad's forces invaded Kuwait.
	   The Iraqi statement said the ban would continue ``until the
United Nations looks at the issue in an honest and positive way,
leading to Iraq's right to the lifting of the unjust sanctions.''
	   Iraq also insisted that the Security Council fire Richard
Butler, chief of the U.N. Special Commission that oversees weapons
inspections. Iraq has long charged that Butler is working on behalf
of the United States to prolong the sanctions.
	   The Security Council was to meet late Saturday to discuss the
situation, a U.N. official said in New York.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said such a ban was ``a
serious breach and a major violation'' of council resolutions.

Westwood leads Monty by one as final round looms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JEREZ, Spain (AP) _ Lee Westwood rolled in a 10-foot birdie putt
at the last to tie with Australia's Peter O'Malley for the lead and
give him a 1-stroke advantage over Colin Montgomerie in the battle
to wind up Europe's top money earner for 1998.
	   Westwood carded a 67 to Montgomerie's 69 in Saturday's third
round of the Volvo Masters and will go out last with O'Malley in
Sunday's final round with the Scot immediately in front of him.
	   Montgomerie, aiming to finish top for an unprecenteded sixth
time in a row, should have been leading into the final round at the
par-72 Montecastillo course. He missed a short birdie putt at 16
and bogeyed the 17th and should have tied Westwood's and O'Malley's
67s.
	   O'Malley and Westwood are on 11-under scores of 205 with
Montgomerie on 206 and Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke, the only
other player in contention to finish atop the earnings list, two
strokes further behind after a 68.
	   Montgomerie leads the European Tour money list with winnings of
760,077 (dlrs 1,276,929). Westwood is No. 2 at 714,812 (dlrs
1,200,884) followed by Clarke at 616,867 (dlrs 1,036,337).
	   For Westwood to end Monty's reign as Europe's No. 1 golfer, he
has to win the tournament and hope that the Scot falls further
behind.
	   ``I'm just cruising along _ not worrying about too much,'' the
Englishman said.
	   ``It's been a dream since I started golf to be number one, but I
know Monty's going to play well tomorrow because he does when the
pressure is on.
	   ``It's just nice to be one in front of him now rather than one
behind,'' Westwood said. But he paid tribute to Montgomerie's five
in a row.
	   ``I don't think people outside the game realize how good an
achievement it is to win the Order of Merit five years in a row.''
	   Despite losing the lead, Montgomerie was upbeat about his
chances of winning the tournament and making it six in a row.
	   ``Now I'm playing ahead of Lee rather than behind him and he
will watch my birdies go in this time,'' he said.
	   ``I've got myself in a good position,'' said the Scot, who
birdied four holes out of six on the way to the turn. ``I was three
behind last night and now I'm only one behind _ forgetting who's in
front.

Both Munich teams stunned in Bundesliga
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Bayern Munich, off to the fastest start in
Bundesliga history, was brought back to earth Saturday by an
unlikely opponent.
	   Eintracht Frankfurt, newly promoted and in 16th place, stunned
Munich 1-0 after the Bundesliga frontrunner had roared to eight
wins and a draw to open the season.
	   But Bayern wasn't the only Munich team to see a streak end
Saturday. Second-place 1860 failed to gain ground when a
seven-match unbeaten streak was stopped by VfL Wolfsburg 3-2.
	   Bayern Munich, playing without suspended striker and prolific
scorer Giovane Elber, displayed little of the high-octane offense
that had allowed it to trample several German opponents.
	   Frankfurt's gamewinner came in the 32rd minute, when Thomas
Sobitzik finished off a free kick from Ansgar Brinkmann that team
captain Ralf Weber extended with his head.
	   ``Frankfurt deserved to win,'' said Bayern coach Ottmar
Hitzfeld. ``We controlled play, but we weren't dangerous enough on
offense.''
	   Despite the stellar play of midfielder Mario Basler, the team's
second most dangerous weapon this season, Munich couldn't dominate
a Frankfurt team playing at home in front of 58,300.
	   After the team's big striker, Carsten Jancker, was sent packing
for a foul in the 61st minute, Munich continued to attack
desperately. But Frankfurt hit back on counters.
	   ``We finally had the luck you need in the Bundesliga. My players
just need to get used to playing in this league,'' said Frankfurt
coach Horst Ehrmantraut, whose job had been reported to be in
danger.
	   Bayern Munich remained five points ahead of 1860, with the two
teams set to tangle next Saturday. But their double loss allowed
Bayer Leverkusen to inch back into the race.
	   Leverkusen blasted Moenchengladbach 8-2 Friday to move one point
back of 1860, while FC Kaiserslautern also edged Hansa Rostock 3-2.
	   Two games were cancelled Saturday after storms swept Germany,
leaving fields unplayable. But VfB Stuttgart also beat Bochum 4-2
and Bremen drew 1-1 with Duisburg.
	   1860 dominated play against Wolfsburg, but wasted its chances.
Striker Bernhard Winkler, who entered with seven goals, missed from
close range several times.
	   Wolfsburg's scores came from Detlef Dammeier in the seventh
minute, Steffen Baumgart in the 47th and Marijan Kovacevic with
four minutes to play.
	   The 1860 Lions finally found the range too late, with Markus
Schroth connecting in the 84th and Bernd Hobsch just before the
whistle.
	   Nigerian striker Jonathan Akpoborie, ending a slump, scored
twice in Stuttgart's win against Bochum. The first goal came just
24 seconds into the match _ the fastest in the Bundesliga this
season.
	   A blast from 24 meters (24 yards) by midfielder Joerg Neun put
visiting Duisburg up 1-0 in the 24th minute, but Yugoslav Rade
Bogdanovicv equalized in the 73rd.

	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Forensic experts examining heavily
burned bodies Saturday were able to identify more of the 60 young
people who died in a Swedish dance hall fire, but the catastrophe's
most tormenting question was still unanswered.
	   How could it happen; what caused the flames that raced through a
hall packed far beyond capacity, blocking one of the exits and
forcing panicked teen-agers to flee down the one remaining
staircase and leap out of second-story windows?
	   ''As long as the technicians haven't established the cause of
the fire, we don't know if it's arson or not,'' Goteborg chief
prosecutor Ulf Noren said Saturday evening.
	   Earlier in the day, Noren had said it was a ``50-50'' chance
that the fire was arson, prompting wide speculation that
authorities had new clues. But Noren later retracted the remark,
saying he'd meant only that no possibilities were being excluded.
	   As investigators worked to find the cause, examiners identified
another 22 bodies, bringing the total to 40, and officials said 49
people were released from hospitals.
	   Of the 162 people injured in Thursday night's fire, 76 remained
hospitalized. Most of the victims were immigrants or of immigrant
parentage, from countries including Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Ethiopia
and current and former Yugoslavia.
	   The first call to authorities was made in heavily accented
Swedish and that, combined with noise and the caller's distress,
delayed the fire squads' response by several minutes.
	   Per-Olof Ortarsen of Goteborg's emergency services line said the
call was so hard to understand that it took three minutes for
workers to figure out what was going on and where to send fire
trucks.
	   The first fire trucks and rescue squads were on the scene six
minutes after the call was received, Ortarsen said at a news
conference. He and other officials declined to comment on whether a
quicker response could have saved anyone.
	   The minutes of delay felt endless to those caught in the terror
of the fire and survivors have spoken angrily of what they saw as a
slow and even obstructive response.
	   ``No help. No police. No firemen,'' 17-year-old Zuhir Hersi, one
of the disc jockeys at the bash, said Friday. ``Just kids helping
kids.''
	   And once the squads arrived, the kids were blocked from helping,
they say.
	   ``We could have saved more young people if only police hadn't
stopped us,'' Mohanned Hussein was quoted as saying by the
newspaper Expressen.
	   On Saturday, hundreds of people stood quietly outside the gutted
building amid flowers and candles as they attempted to come to
grips with catastrophe.
	   In the parking lot that a day before had been a tumult of
ambulances and screams, mourners had laid a 30-meter-long
(100-foot-long) pile of bouquets, candles and cards of remembrance.
	   The cards' inscriptions were brief _ ``I will see you in
heaven,'' ``We miss you'' _ and the people who stood reading them
also had few words.
	   ``I just wanted to show my sympathy. I think about them. There's
nothing else we can do,'' said Caroline Ericsson, who didn't know
any of the victims.
	   ''It's damn difficult,'' said Connie Mesfin, who said she lost a
friend in the blaze.
	   Lasse Gustafsson, a former Goteborg firefighter severely
disfigured in an explosion, also came, to try to show the victims'
relatives and friends that spirit can help them pull through
despair.
	   ``I can't give them hope. Consolation is enough,'' he said as
people nearby cast uneasy glances at his scars.
	   Many of those injured in the blaze may have to endure similar
shocked looks the rest of their lives. Authorities say the
explosive fire quickly raised the temperature in the hall to 600
degrees C (1,100 F).
	   The hall was packed far beyond its capacity. Licensed to hold a
maximum of 150, the hall held at least 250 and perhaps as many as
400 when the fire hit.
	   One of the two exit stairways was blocked by fire and there were
conflicting statements from witnesses as to whether the fire came
up the stairs from a lower level, or whether it spread there after
breaking out in the second-floor rooms.
	   The worst previous fire disaster in modern Sweden was in 1978 in
Boraas, when 20 people died in a hotel fire. Goteborg, Sweden's
second-largest city with about 435,000 people, is 500 kilometers
(300 miles) southwest of Stockholm.

World Bank says Pakistan servicing debt on time despite economic

woes

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Reeling from international sanctions
and a dlrs 32 billion external debt, Pakistan still is making the
interest payments on its loans to global donors, according to a
World Bank statement issued Saturday.
	   ``Despite difficulties, so far Pakistan has continued to service
its International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBDR)
and International Development Association (IDA) payments within the
allowable time-frame,'' said a World Bank statement issued in the
federal capital.
	   The country's already fragile economy has been shaken by
sanctions from the World powers, including the United States and
Japan, following underground nuclear tests in May.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government is seeking emergency
funding of dlrs 5 billion from global donor agencies to plug its
financial resource gap in the 1998/99 fiscal. It includes debt
rescheduling of around dlrs 2 billion or so and cash funding of
dlrs 3 billion.
	   ``The World Bank's support to Pakistan would continue as
planned, provided reform program remains on track, project
implementation is satisfactory and Pakistan continues to be a
borrower in good standing,'' said the statement.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With Western powers trying to get a
2,000-member verification mission started in Kosovo, a U.S.
official said dozens more Americans would start arriving Saturday.
	   Richard Huckaby, spokesman for the U.S. portion of the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission, known as KDOM, said 13 Americans were
expected in Pristina on Saturday and another 70 would come by the
middle of next week.
	   The new arrivals join 48 Americans working for KDOM, Huckaby
said.
	   The ultimate makeup of the verification mission isn't known, as
it is still being assembled, but the OSCE has said that Russia,
Germany, France, Italy and Britain will each provide about 200
people.
	   Other nations, including the former Soviet bloc states of
Romania and Czech Republic, have offered personnel. The overall
number of contributing nations was not yet known. Norway has
promised dlrs 26 million for security, housing and communications
for the first year.
	   Also Saturday, assistant U.S. Secretary of State Julia Taft
arrived in Pristina to start a trip that was to include visiting
villages and meeting with relief and refugee agencies.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Obaid al-Dossary scored once in each
half, including the game winner with 16 minutes remaining, to lead
Saudi Arabia to a 2-1 victory over Kuwait Saturday in the opening
match for both teams at the six-nation Gulf Cup.
	   Al-Dossary scored six minutes after the opening kickoff, driving
a header in the left corner, and again in the 74th, heading a ball
over the head of Kuwaiti keeper Khalid al-Fadhly.
	   Eight-time and defending champion Kuwait responded three minutes
after al-Dossary's second goal, scoring on midfielder Hussein
al-Khadhari's header.
	   Basshar Abdullah and Jassim al-Huwaidy were able to get behind
the Saudi defense on several occasions, but were unable to finish.
	   Al-Howaidy missed one chance in the 40th minute when he failed
to finish an opportunity unmarked in the penalty area.
	   Despite the two-goal advantage late, Saudi Arabia continued to
press forward with al-Dossary, midfielder Khalid Timawi and captain
Yousuf Thiniyan leading the offense.
	   The final whistle was loudly cheered by the crowd of 20,000 _
mostly Saudis, although dozens of police were called in to control
the rejoicing after some threwing plastic bottles at fellow
spectators, witnesses said.
	   Later Saturday, Oman played Qatar in the day's other match. On
Friday, the United Arab Emirates beat Bahrain 1-0.

	   MALAGA, Spain (AP) _ A drunken man arrested after he attacked an
air hostess with a bottle of vodka on a British charter flight to
Spain was granted conditional release by a Spanish magistrate
Saturday, news reports said.
	   Steven Handy allegedly hit Fiona Weir over the head with the
bottle and cut her back and arms with broken glass before he was
restrained by fellow passengers and later arrested, the Spanish
national news agency EFE reported.
	   The incident happened early Friday at the end of a three-hour
Air Tours flight between London's Gatwick Airport and Malaga in
southern Spain. Handy, 30, from Dover in southern England, had been
behaving in a rowdy way throughout the flight, EFE said.
	   The attack prompted Air Tours to ban Handy for life from all its
flights and holidays, an example followed Saturday by Virgin's
Richard Branson.
	   Branson issued a statement calling for greater coordination
among companies ``to ground anyone for life for this kind of
horrible behavior.''
	   The statement also announced that Virgin would next week talk to
Air Tours about setting up a database to coordinate a list of
offenders to be made available to all airlines and holiday
companies.
	   Weir, 31, required 40 stitches, EFE reported. She was due to fly
back to Britain late Saturday and hold a press conference in the
northern city of Manchester on Sunday morning.

Lost trunk tells tale of uprooted Greeks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Reuniting bonds torn apart by war, a
Turkish writer said he will return heirlooms to a Greek family
which fled Asia Minor in the 1920s, it was reported Saturday.
	   The daily Ethnos said author Kemal Yalcin had spent over ten
years looking for the descendants of the uprooted Minoglou family.
They had left a trunk containing embroidered cloth and valuable
possessions in the care of his grandfather 78 years ago.
	   The Minoglous, who now live near the central Greek town of
Volos, fled a tiny village in Turkey in the wake of the 1919-22 war
which Greece lost to the Turks.
	   Over one million Greeks from Asia Minor were made refugees as a
result of the war and the subsequent forced population exchanges.
	   The Yalcin and Minoglou families had been close before that war.
	   The newspaper said Yalcin's extensive search for the family had
inspired him to write a book, ``The Lost Dowry'', about the plight
of Asia Minor Greeks in the 1920s.
	   Yalcin, who lives in Germany, plans to visit Greece at Christmas
to return the trunk.
	   The newspaper did not give details about how the 46-year-old
Yalcin found the family.

	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Forensic experts examining heavily
burned bodies Saturday were able to identify more of the 60 young
people who died in a Swedish dance hall fire, but the catastrophe's
most tormenting question was still unanswered.
	   How could it happen; what caused the flames that raced through a
hall packed far beyond capacity, blocking one of the exits and
forcing panicked teen-agers to flee down the one remaining
staircase and leap out of second-story windows?
	   ''As long as the technicians haven't established the cause of
the fire, we don't know if it's arson or not,'' Goteborg chief
prosecutor Ulf Noren said Saturday evening.
	   Earlier in the day, Noren had said it was a ``50-50'' chance
that the fire was arson, prompting wide speculation that
authorities had new clues. But Noren later retracted the remark,
saying he'd meant only that no possibilities were being excluded.
	   As investigators worked to find the cause, examiners identified
another 22 bodies, bringing the total to 40, and officials said 49
people were released from hospitals.
	   Of the 162 people injured in Thursday night's fire, 76 remained
hospitalized. Most of the victims were immigrants or of immigrant
parentage, from countries including Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Ethiopia
and current and former Yugoslavia.
	   The first call to authorities was made in heavily accented
Swedish and that, combined with noise and the caller's distress,
delayed the fire squads' response by several minutes.
	   Per-Olof Ortgren of Goteborg's emergency services line said the
call was so hard to understand that it took three minutes for
workers to figure out what was going on and where to send fire
trucks.
	   The first fire trucks and rescue squads were on the scene six
minutes after the call was received, Ortgren said at a news
conference. He and other officials declined to comment on whether a
quicker response could have saved anyone.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a move that could provoke a showdown
with the United Nations, Iraq announced Saturday that it would no
longer allow U.N. weapons inspectors to work in the country.
	   The decision by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his top
advisers exempted only a handful of experts from the International
Atomic Energy Agency, who monitor suspected nuclear sites.
	   The move was seen as a response to a U.N. Security Council
decision Friday to review Iraq's progress on eliminating prohibited
weapons.
	   Although it pledged a ``comprehensive review,'' the council did
not accede to Iraq's demand that the review lead directly to the
removal of the sweeping trade sanctions imposed in 1990 after
Baghdad's forces invaded Kuwait.
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until the Special Commission
certifies that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq insists it has done so, but the commission says Baghdad
continues to hide information on weapons, especially those with
biological and chemical agents.
	   The Iraqi statement said the ban would continue ``until the
United Nations looks at the issue in an honest and positive way,
leading to Iraq's right to the lifting of the unjust sanctions.''
	   Iraq also insisted that the Security Council fire Richard
Butler, chief of the U.N. Special Commission that oversees weapons
inspections. Iraq has long accused Butler of working on behalf of
the United States to prolong sanctions.
	   It remained unclear if Saturday's decision would provoke the
United States and Britain to threaten military action against
Baghdad, as they did earlier this year after the Iraqi regime
prevented U.N. inspectors from entering Saddam's presidential
palaces.
	   In New York, the U.N. Security Council called a meeting for
later Saturday to discuss the move.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Iraq's move was ``a
serious breach and a major violation'' of council resolutions.

Migrants arrested in phone scam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Ten Pakistani and two Indian migrants were
arrested for participation in a lucrative telephone scam used to
make free calls around the world, police said Saturday.
	   State telephone company officials estimated that calls worth
dlrs 3.2 million had been made illegally to India and Pakistan.
	   The scam involved tapping telephone lines to set up a low-cost
international calling network, police said. The calls were charged
to the phone company.
	   The arrests were made after a raid on a downtown Athens
apartment late Friday. Police said two men believed to have set up
illegal network are still at large.

	   Details of English Premier League games:
 &UR; Coventry 0, Arsenal 1 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Dennis Bergkamp and Tony Adams missed the game through injury
but Arsenal still had the big guns to overcome Coventry. Nicolas
Anelka scored the only goal in the 63rd minute after Marc Overmars'
break from his own half.
 &UR; Derby 2, Leeds 2 (1-2) &QC; 
	   Stefan Schnoor fired in a third-minute penalty after Robert
Molenaar had brought down Dean Sturridge. Leeds leveled in the 16th
minute when Molenaar headed in David Hopkin's free kick and went
ahead through Harry Kewell's deflected shot two minutes before half
time. Dean Sturridge made it 2-2 in the 56th minute with a shot
from eight meters out from Schnoor's pass.
 &UR; Everton 1, Manchester United 4 (1-2) &QC; 
	   United went ahead in the 14th minute when Paul Scholes passed on
a cross by Jesper Blomqvist and Dwight Yorke scored from close
range. It was 2-0 in the 23rd when Everton defender Craig Short
headed a cross from David Beckham into his own net. Seven minutes
later, Duncan Ferguson headed in Michael Ball's free kick. Andy
Cole hit the post and then followed up by scoring from the rebound
in the 59th minute and it was 4-1 five minutes later through Jesper
Blomqvist after an Everton corner had been cleared and the home
defense was caught upfield.
 &UR; Leicester 1, Liverpool 0 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Tony Cottee scored the only goal of the game in the 79th minute
after Emile Heskey and Neil Lennon had opened up the Liverpool

from the end for a foul on Muzzy Izzet, his second cautionable
foul.
 &UR; Newcastle 0, West Ham 3 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Stuart Pearce was sent off three minutes into the second half
for elbowing Trevor Sinclair in the back. Eight minutes later the
Hammers went ahead through Ian Wright's 25-meter shot after he had
shaken off a challenge by Newcastle's Laurent Charvet. Sinclair
made it 2-0 with a powerful shot after a break by Paul Kitson and
Wright scored the third from John Hartson's pass in injury time.
 &UR; Sheffield Wednesday 0, Southampton 0 &QC; 
	   Wednesday went four games without scoring and Saints' goalkeeper
Paul Jones didn't have to make a save until six minutes from the
end when he stopped Andy Booth's header.
 &UR; Wimbledon 1, Blackburn 1 (0-0) &QC;

Rare snow leopards making return in Armenia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Snow leopards, which had been hunted to
near-extinction in Armenia, have begun to reappear in increasing
numbers, a government official said Saturday.
	   From a low of just two leopards in a government preserve a few
years ago, there are now an estimated 30 throughout the country,
Ministry of Ecology spokesman Artzun Pepanyan said.
	   Snow leopards, indigenous to Central Asia and once highly prized
for their pelts, are considered endangered internationally. Their
worldwide population was estimated at 4,500 to 7,400 in 1996,
according to the World Wildlife Fund.
	   Pepanyan said he did not know why the animals are returning to
Armenia, but said other formerly rare animals _ including bears,
wild boars, wolves and Armenian mouflons, a kind of wild sheep _
have also been thriving.
	   In fact, he said, the animals have begun to cause problems to
livestock farmers in some parts of the former Soviet republic,
particularly in the vicinity of the town of Dzermuk.
	   The government has proposed drugging problem animals and moving
them to less populated parts of the country.

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   A deck of middle to high clouds blanketed the skies across the
eastern and southern half of Puerto Rico during the morning hours.
Only isolated light showers were detected moving northward in the
vicinity of Guanica in southern Puerto Rico and over Vieques and
Culebra off the east coast of the island. The western half of
Puerto Rico enjoyed mostly sunny skies.
	   The skies over the U.S. Virgin islands varied from variably
cloudy to partly cloudy during the morning. Isolated showers were
detected over the surrounding waters and over the extreme western
sections of St. Croix and over St. John.
	   A weak frontal boundary continues to affect the weather across
our local area with clouds and showers. Satellite photographs this
morning indicated that this boundary was stretching from the
Caribbean sea just south of Hispaniola across Puerto Rico and into
the Atlantic. An upper level trough continues to be west of our
area and so weather conditions this afternoon should be similar to
the conditions of the previous days. However, available moisture
has diminished over our area and that could be a limiting factor in
the rainfall amounts across our area. Nevertheless, due to the
heavy rains of the past few days, the ground across most of our
area is still saturated. Any additional moderate rainfall could
cause flooding problems in those areas where showers and storms
develop this afternoon.

Israel, U.S. sign agreement on missiles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In back-to-back signings in Jerusalem and
Washington Saturday, Israel and the United States agreed to fight
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East and
work together on strategic matters.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the United
States was committed to strengthening Israel's defensive and
deterrent capabilities.
	   ``This is additional proof of the tight alliance on all matters
concerning our vital interests,'' Netanyahu said at the signing
ceremony conducted in his office with U.S. ambassador to Israel
Edward Walker.
	   A similar signing was held at the White House between U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Israel's ambassador to the United States
Zalman Shoval.
	   Under the terms of the agreement, Israel and the United States
will establish a joint strategic committee to oversee enhanced
technological, strategic, and military cooperation between the two
countries. The United States would consider the regional deployment
of ballistic missiles of intermediate or greater range in the event
of a threat to Israel's security.
	   ``In the event of such a threat,'' the text of the agreement
reads, ``the United States would consult with Israel with respect
to what support, diplomatic or otherwise, it can lend.''
	   But U.S. embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz said the pact was not
a guarantee of U.S. military assistance in the event of ballistic
missile deployment targeting Israel.
	   ``It is a rock solid commitment to Israel's security, not a
defense treaty which would require us to do something in the event
of an attack,'' Schwartz said.
	   Schwartz said that the two leaders decided to create the pact
during their bilateral meetings at a Mideast summit earlier this
month, but that the idea was first raised in July after Iran tested
its Shahab-3 missile which is capable of striking Israel and U.S.
stationed in the region.

Saudi Arabia beats Kuwait 2-1; Oman topples Qatar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Oman-Qatar &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Obaid al-Dossary scored once in each
half, including the game winner with 16 minutes remaining, to lead
Saudi Arabia to a 2-1 victory over Kuwait Saturday in the opening
match for both teams at the six-nation Gulf Cup.
	   Al-Dossary scored six minutes after the opening kickoff, driving
a header in the left corner, and again in the 74th, heading a ball
over the head of Kuwaiti keeper Khalid al-Fadhly.
	   Eight-time and defending champion Kuwait responded three minutes
after al-Dossary's second goal, scoring on midfielder Hussein
al-Khadhari's header.
	   In the later game, forward Taqi Mubarak scored off a rebound of
a blocked penalty in the 58th minute to give Oman a 2-1 victory
over Qatar.
	   Kuwait had its chances with Basshar Abdullah and Jassim
al-Huwaidy able to get behind the Saudi defense on several
occasions, but were unable to finish.
	   Al-Howaidy missed one chance in the 40th minute when he failed
to finish an opportunity unmarked in the penalty area.
	   Despite the two-goal advantage late, Saudi Arabia continued to
press forward with al-Dossary, midfielder Khalid Timawi and captain
Yousuf Thiniyan leading the offense.
	   The final whistle was loudly cheered by the crowd of 20,000 _
mostly Saudis, although dozens of police were called in to control
the rejoicing after some threwing plastic bottles at fellow
spectators, witnesses said.
	   In the second game, Mubarak's goal came after teammate Farid
Mazroui missed his penalty chance. Mazroui had given Oman the lead
in the 26th minute on a header.
	   Qatar equalized three minutes later on a well-timed header by
forward Adil Khamis.
	   But the Qataris, who posessed the ball almost equally with the
Omanis, suffered the same as the Kuwaiting, failing to finish
several close chances.
	   On Friday the United Arab Emirates beat Bahrain 1-0 in the
opening match of the tournament.

Loroupe women's favorite, men's race wide-open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: NEW throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Since running the fastest women's marathon ever,
Kenya's Tegla Loroupe raises expectations every time she runs.
	   Can she beat the 2 hours, 20 minutes, 47 seconds, she ran in
Rotterdam in April? Can she become the first to break the 2:20
barrier? Can she be defeated?
	   Loroupe's first test since Rotterdam will come Sunday in the New
York City Marathon, where she's considered the favorite despite the
presence of defending champion Franziska Rochat-Moser of
Switzerland and 1996 winner Anita Catuna of Romania.
	   ``She's the best marathoner in the world,'' said Portugal's Rosa
Mota, the 1988 Olympic champion. ``She can run 2:20 or under on a
fast course.
	   ``But this is a very difficult course. It's not fast like Berlin
or London or Rotterdam. If the weather is good, if she feels good,
if the atmosphere is right, it's possible to break the record, but
not likely in New York.''
	   Loroupe agrees, and she knows from experience. She tried in
1996, but after a record-breaking 1:11:04 for the first half, she
was worn out and finished seventh.
	   ``The hills on this course are very tough,'' said the 1.50-meter
(4-foot-11), 25-kilogram (83-pound) Kenyan, the women's winner in
1994 and 1995 and the seventh-place finisher again last year. ``You
can't break the world record here. ... Women can go under 2:20 or
2:19, but not here. This time I will try for the course record.''
	   Australia's Lisa Ondieki set that record, 2:24:40, in 1992.
	   While Loroupe is No. 1 among the women _ four minutes separates
her and the second-fastest woman _ the men's race appears wide
open.
	   The field includes the 1-2 finishers from last year, Kenyans
John Kagwe and Joseph Chebet, 1996 Olympic gold medalist Josia
Thugwane of South Africa, two-time champion German Silva of Mexico
and 1997 world champion Abel Anton of Spain.
	   Last year, Kagwe finished 11 seconds behind the course record _
2:08:01 set by Ethiopia's Juma Ikangaa in 1989 _ because he stopped
to tie his shoelaces twice and ran the final 5 kilometers (3 miles)
with them loose.
	   He denies reports that he's not in top condition, and thinks the
notion will work to his advantage. ``They might think I'm not in
good shape,'' Kagwe said.
	   Chebet, the runner-up to countryman Moses Tanui at Boston in
April, is changing his race strategy for Sunday.
	   ``When I ran in New York last year and at Boston this year, I
tried to push the pace,'' he said. ``I tried to cross the first
half-marathon very fast. Now, I will try to run the second half
faster.
	   ``Last year, I had a problem in my leg and I was not able to go
with him (Kagwe)'' when he made a break with 6 1-2 kilometers (4
miles) left.
	   Thugwane is the fastest marathoner in the field of about 30,000,
running 2:07:28 to win the Fukuoka Marathon in Japan in December.
He's trying to make amends for a disappointing performance in New
York three years ago.
	   ``In 1995, I did not finish,'' Thugwane said. ``It was a
difficult race. It was rainy and cold, my leg was bothering me and
my whole body got tired. I wound up in a hospital.''
	   Since winning the Olympic gold medal in Atlanta, Thugwane has
become a hero for all South Africans. He has learned to read and
write and has gone from poverty to riches, moving from a tin shack
in the little town of Bethal to a plush home in suburban
Johannesburg.
	   Anton won the world title last year by five seconds,
outsprinting countryman Martin Fiz in the final 400 meters, then
won this year's London Marathon in a career-best 2:07:57, missing
the course record by two seconds when he waved to the crowd near
the finish line.
	   Silva, the 1994 and 1995 New York City winner, skipped the 1996
race but came back to finish fifth last year in his fastest time on
the course, 2:10:19.
	   He improved his career best time to 2:08:56 in finishing sixth
in Boston in April, but Silva's most memorable race was in New York
in 1994, when he veered off the course with about 800 meters (a
half-mile) to go, got turned around by a police officer and rallied
to beat compatriot Benjamin Paredes by two seconds _ the closest
finish in the race's history.
	   When Silva and Loroupe won together in '94 and '95, they were
warmly embraced by the city. The feeling still is the same for the
``Happy Couple,'' whose bubbly, engaging personalities have
captivated New Yorkers.
	   ``I feel at home here,'' Silva said.
	   Loroupe added: ``When I run on the streets here ... they say
things like, `We love you Tegla'.''
	   After her blazing first half in 1996, Loroupe switched her race
plan last year, but that backfired. She was later found to have two
stress fractures in her spine and had to take time off and wear a
back brace.
	   ``I made a big mistake,'' she said of last year's race. ``I
started slow and I didn't use the energy I had, so my legs became
tired.''
	   On Sunday, she'll be tired once again at the end of the marathon
_ but she also may be wearing the winner's laurel wreath.

Nuclear accelerator reopens in Armenia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ A nuclear accelerator at the Yerevan
Institute of Physics has been restarted eight years after it was
shut down for lack of money, the institute's director said
Saturday.
	   The accelerator was built in the early 1970s and closed in 1990,
Armenia's last year as a Soviet republic. Nuclear accelerators
speed up the movement of atomic particles, charging them with
energy. They are valuable in the study of nuclear energy and
particle physics.
	   Physicists from Armenia, Russia and Ukraine gathered at the
institute last week to conduct an experiment involving polarized
photon beams, according to Ruben Mkrtchyan, the director of the
institute.

Abduction of father and son in Sardinia fails
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OLBIA, Sardinia (AP) _ Masked bandits kidnapped the 14-year-old
son of a Sardinian cheese producer Saturday and tied up the father,
but the abduction quickly ended when the the man freed himself and
alerted police, Italian news reports said.
	   The Italian news agency ANSA said police reportedly found the
boy, unharmed, tied to a tree, apparently abandoned by the
kidnappers who possibly sensed that authorities were hot on their
trail.
	   The abduction took place in the countryside about 10 kilometers
(six miles) south of Olbia, a small city in northern Sardinia.
	   Sardinia's rugged inland is home to gangs of bandits who kidnap
for ransom and often keep their victims for months or even years
before they are rescued or ransomed.
	   The latest victim was identified at Alessandro Mura, 14, whose
father, Mario Mura, apparently was able to free himself without
help after the three bandits, armed with pistols and an automatic
rifle, fled his business with the boy.
	   The boy was found a few hours later.
	   Police were searching for the kidnappers.

Demonstrators protest against the monarchy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Police said Saturday they arrested nine people
after demonstrators marched through central London to protest
against the monarchy.
	   Scotland Yard said three people were arrested after attempting
to throw a cardboard ax over the gates of Buckingham Palace, Queen
Elizabeth II's London residence.
	   Organizers from the protest group Movement Against the Monarchy
said they had distributed 100,000 leaflets inviting people to
attend, although police estimated the size of the protest at 400.
	   The demonstrators, some of whom carried black anarchist flags
and banners bearing anti-monarchical slogans, had hoped to march en
mass to Buckingham Palace, but police vetoed the proposal.
	   Instead, the march ended near Parliament outside the Banqueting
Hall, where Charles I was beheaded in 1649 after England's Civil
War.
	   Britons remain broadly supportive of the monarchy. In an August
poll for The Times newspaper, 15 percent believed Britain would be
better off without a monarchy _ while 53 percent said losing the
royals would damage the country. Another 29 percent said it would
make no difference.

Uzbekistan, Kazakstan sign accords on cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Uzbekistan and Kazakstan signed an economic
cooperation agreement Saturday, as well as pacts on crime-fighting
and other matters, a news agency reported.
	   The agreements were signed on the second day of Kazak President
Nursultan Nazarbayev's official visit to Tashkent, the Uzbek
capital, where he met with President Islam Karimov.
	   The economic cooperation pact runs through 2005. Other
agreements pledged cooperation in customs, education, health and
culture.
	   ``We agreed to continue joint efforts to deepen both bilateral
cooperation and, within the framework of the Central Asian economic
community, to solve regional problems,'' Karimov said, according to
ITAR-Tass.

Robbie Paul clinches contoversial first test victory for Kiwis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HUDDERSFIELD, England (AP) _ Robbie Paul scored a
match-clinching try and then make a controversial last-minute
match-saving tackle on Keith Senior as New Zealand beat Britain
22-16 in the first of three rugby league tests Saturday.
	   When Paul raced through a stretched British defense to make it
22-12 with seven minutes to go, the Kiwis looked to be streaking
home at the McAlpine Stadium
	   But Jason Robinson crossed for a try to bring Britain within a
converted try of tying the game.
	   It looked like the home team had got it when Senior climbed to
catch a high kick ahead from Andy Farrell on the tryline. But Paul
didn't let him touch the ground, even with his feet.
	   The Kiwi star broke the rules by holding the towering Senior up
and carrying him off the field to prevent the score. Referee Bill
Harrigan ruled it a penalty against Paul and Britain was unable to
take advantage.
	   But TV replays indicated that Paul had taken Senior out after
the British winger had crossed the tryline and should have awarded
a penalty try.
	   Earlier in the match, Britain conceded an embarrassing try at
the end of the first half. The half time hooter went during the
middle of a New Zealand move and the British players, expecting the
referee to blow the end of the first 40, stopped playing. The Kiwis
kept going and Joe Vagana went over for a try which was converted
by Daryl Halligan.
	   Furious that they hadn't played to the referee's whistle, the
British players hit back from 12-2 down to level at 12-12 early in
the second half with tries by Senior and Paul Newlove.
	   But Stacey Jones and Robbie Paul both crossed the British line
to move the Kiwis well ahead again before the controversial ending
to the game.
	   The second match is next Saturday at Bolton.
	   Lineups:
	   Britain _ Kris Radlinski, Jason Robinson, Gary Connolly, Craig
Newlove, Keith Senior, Paul Sculthorpe, Tony Smith, Neil Cowie,
Keiron Cunningham, Darren Fleary, Chris Joynt, Lee Gilmour, Andrew
Farrell.
	   New Zealand _ Richie Barnett, Sean Hoppe, Ruben Wiki, Kevin Iro,
Daryl Halligan, Robbie Paul, Stacey Jones, Quentin Pongia, Syd Eru,
Joe Vagana, Stephen Kearney, Jarrod McCracken, Logan Swann.

After 11 winless times, someone wins big in Italy's superlotto
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ After 11 winless draws, Italy's biggest lotto
jackpot ever found a winner Saturday -- someone who bought a dlr
2.50 ticket in the south and takes home nearly dlrs 40 million.
	   Super Enalotto fever had been rising as the take mounted in the
twice-weekly numbers-guessing game, which drew hopefuls from France
and Switzerland to buy tickets at the last-minute Saturday just
inside the Italian border.
	   Finally, someone picked the winning series of numbers, which
this time were 1, 21, 30, 61, 73 and 84.
	   Winners of big Italian lottery and other games don't usually
come forward to identify themselves, and usually all that is know
is where the winning ticket was purchased, in this case, near the
port city of Bari in the ``heel'' of the Italian peninsula.
	   Saturday's win was all luck and no skill -- the winner brought a
ticket with numbers picked by a computer.

Catholic man slain as Northern Ireland misses key peace deadline

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's rival
politicians missed the first important deadline of their peace
agreement Saturday, a day marked by the killing of a Catholic man
as he walked home alone.
	   Van driver Brian Service, 35, was shot twice in the back of the
head and three times in the back. Local Catholic residents and
politicians blamed pro-British extremists from nearby Protestant
turf.
	   Later, an anonymous caller to a Belfast news organization
claimed responsibility for the killing on behalf of the Red Hand
Commando, a small gang that along with other outlawed pro-British
groups has observed a cease-fire since 1994.
	   But the caller used no established codeword to authenticate the
claim. A politician linked to the group, Billy Smyth, said there
was ``absolutely no way the Red Hand Commando sanctioned that
shooting. It wouldn't fit in with their commitment to a peace
strategy.''

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras: their homes.
	   At sea in the Caribbean, two U.S. Coast Guard C-130 planes
continued the search for a tourist schooner with 31 people that had
reported being rocked by the storm on Tuesday.
	   By early Saturday, Mitch's winds _ once near 180 mph (288 kph) _
had dropped to 35 mph (55 kph) and the storm was located about 25
miles (40 kms) south of Santa Rosa de Copan, Honduras, moving west
at 7 mph (11 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center reported.
	   Heavy rain continued to fall in Tegucigalpa and parts of
northern Nicaragua, but weather began to clear on Honduras'
northern coast, lashed for much of the week by rains and high
winds.
	   Neighboring El Salvador, where four people died in flash floods,
declared a state of emergency Saturday. Mexico reported one death
from Mitch on Monday.
	   Police fanned out across Tegucigalpa to stem what National
Police Chief Col. Napoleon Flores Ponce said were hundreds of
people robbing stores in the capital. Police had orders to ``take
drastic action'' to stop the looting, he told a local radio
station.
	   ``Almost everything is damaged or destroyed and it will be
difficult to recover from such a tragedy,'' said Col. Anael Perez,
spokesman for Honduras' Permanent Emergency Commission, describing
the damage in this country of 6 million.
	   The Coast Guard reported that two Swiss citizens were rescued
from a life raft after their 33-foot yacht (10.5-meter) yacht went
down Monday in the Caribbean, but there was still no sign of a
258-foot (77-meter) schooner, the Fantome, missing since Tuesday.
	   ``There's still not a lot we can do with the way the weather is
down there,'' said Jeff Hall, spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard.
	   The Antigua-registered Fantome, once owned by Aristotle Onassis,
is operated out of Miami by Windjammer Barefoot Cruises.
	   After dropping its tourist passengers off in Belize Monday
morning, the crew headed toward Roatan Island, off the north coast,
to escape the hurricane _ which for two days was centered near that
island.
	   In their last communication, the crew of the Fantome said they
were experiencing 100-knot winds and 40-degree rolls, said
Windjammer spokesman James Canty.
	   The ship carried an emergency transmitter, but no signal has
been received from that transponder, according to the Coast Guard.
	   While tropical storm warnings were discontinued Saturday, states
of emergency remained in effect in Honduras and Nicaragua.
	   With rainfall of 4 inches (10 cms) an hour at the height of the
storm, downed bridges, rampant rivers, toppled trees and mudslides
had isolated hundreds of communities where food, water and medicine
were in short supply.
	   In Tegucigalpa, the capital's airport was closed and more than
30,000 people had been evacuated. An equal number had already been
taken to shelters in the nation's second city, San Pedro Sula in
the north.
	   In small coastal communities near San Pedro Sula army troops and
fire fighters moved in with boats to rescue people still clinging
to roof tops
	   Clara Bonilla, a 31-year-old mother, spent the night in a school
bus near San Pedro Sula with her four children.
	   ``It got very cold in the night, and no one has given us much
help,'' Bonilla said as she clutched her youngest daughter.

Real Madrid trounces Extremadura 5-1 to go top of table
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP)_ Real Madrid brushed aside doubts about
recent irregular play trouncing lowly Extremadura 5-1 Saturday in
the 8th-round of the Spanish soccer league, and snatching the top
spot from Mallorca that has yet to play.
	   Robert Jarni of Croatia scored Madrid's first goal in the first
minute. Alaves fans contested the second goal headed by Brazilian
Savio in the 22nd minute, but there was no confusion when Fernando
Hierro successfully converted a penalty to put Madrid three up in
the 37th minute.
	   After the break Croatian Davor Suker continued the punishment
sending a looping goal over the 'keeper to make the score 4-0 in
the 59th minute.
	   Sloppy defending by Madrid defense allowed Carlos Alejandro Dure
to score a compensation goal for Extremadura in the 66th, but
Clarence Seerdorf of Holland twisted in the knife again to make it
5-1 just before the final whistle blew.
	   Madrid consequently jumped to the No. 1 spot with 17 points, one
ahead of Mallorca that is due to play its 8th-round game against
Deportivo de la Coruna on Sunday.
	   Celta and FC Barcelona both with 13 points were playing late
games Saturday against Racing and Real Sociedad respectively.
	   Further down the table _ right at the bottom _ Oliverio 'Oli'
Alvarez' goal against Salamanca in the 55th minute was enough to
give struggling Betis its second victory of the season.
	   The win coincided with Javier Clemente's return to Spanish
soccer as Betis coach, less than two months after being sacked from
the national squad.
	   It was greeted with great enthusiasm by the home crowd, hopeful
that the team which boasts such stars as Brazil's Denilson and
Nigerian international Finidi George, was finally putting an end to
its nightmare start to the season.
	   Also Saturday, mid-table Atletico de Madrid recovered from last
week's embarrassing 4-0 defeat by Mallorca and survived the absence
of its injured hero Francisco `Kiko' Navaez to score a
tripled-headed 3-0 victory over Alaves.
	   The party began in the 7th minute with a header from Kiko's
replacement up front Jose Mari Romero.
	   Stefano Torrisi of Italy knocked in the second in similar
fashion in the 18th minute and Fernando Correa of Argentina headed
the score to 3-0 in the last few seconds of the game.
	   In a match littered with yellow cards, Atletico's Vladimir
Jugovic of Yugoslavia was sent off after receiving his second in
the 33rd minute. Alaves remained one man up until a red card sent
off Jorge Azcoitia in the 73rd.
	   In other late games Saturday Zaragoza was hosting Valencia and
Athletic de Bilbao took on Espanyol.
	   The remainder of the 8th-round matches due Sunday promised two
lower-half battles with Vallarreal playing Tenerife while
Valladolid facing Oviedo.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Officials in Honduras, Nicaragua
and Mexico raised the death toll from Hurricane Mitch to 306
Saturday, with reports slowly reaching national capitals and the
full extent of the damage finally becoming apparent.
	   In the Honduran capital, floodwaters rose to the third floor of
some buildings after Mitch was downgraded to a tropical depression.
	   Dozens of houses in Tegucigalpa were washed away, seven of the
city's 10 bridges were knocked out and patients were evacuated from
the third floor of the Social Security hospital after the Rio
Grande River overflowed.

	   At sea in the Caribbean, two U.S. Coast Guard C-130 planes
continued the search for a tourist schooner with 31 people that had
reported being rocked by the storm on Tuesday.
	   By early Saturday, Mitch's winds _ once near 180 mph (288 kph) _
had dropped to 35 mph (55 kph) and the storm was located about 25
miles (40 kms) south of Santa Rosa de Copan, Honduras, moving west
at 7 mph (11 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center reported.
	   Heavy rain continued to fall in Tegucigalpa and parts of
northern Nicaragua, but weather began to clear on Honduras'
northern coast, lashed for much of the week by rains and high
winds.
	   Neighboring El Salvador, where four people died in flash floods,
declared a state of emergency Saturday. Mexico reported one death
from Mitch on Monday.
	   Police fanned out across Tegucigalpa to stem what National
Police Chief Col. Napoleon Flores Ponce said were hundreds of
people robbing stores in the capital. Police had orders to ``take
drastic action'' to stop the looting, he told a local radio
station.
	   ``Almost everything is damaged or destroyed and it will be
difficult to recover from such a tragedy,'' said Col. Anael Perez,
spokesman for Honduras' Permanent Emergency Commission, describing
the damage in this country of 6 million.
	   The Coast Guard reported that two Swiss citizens were rescued
from a life raft after their 33-foot yacht (10.5-meter) yacht went
down Monday in the Caribbean, but there was still no sign of a
258-foot (77-meter) schooner, the Fantome, missing since Tuesday.
	   ``There's still not a lot we can do with the way the weather is
down there,'' said Jeff Hall, spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard.
	   The Antigua-registered Fantome, once owned by Aristotle Onassis,
is operated out of Miami by Windjammer Barefoot Cruises.
	   After dropping its tourist passengers off in Belize Monday
morning, the crew headed toward Roatan Island, off the north coast,
to escape the hurricane _ which for two days was centered near that
island.
	   In their last communication, the crew of the Fantome said they
were experiencing 100-knot winds and 40-degree rolls, said
Windjammer spokesman James Canty.
	   The ship carried an emergency transmitter, but no signal has
been received from that transponder, according to the Coast Guard.
	   While tropical storm warnings were discontinued Saturday, states
of emergency remained in effect in Honduras and Nicaragua.
	   With rainfall of 4 inches (10 cms) an hour at the height of the
storm, downed bridges, rampant rivers, toppled trees and mudslides
had isolated hundreds of communities where food, water and medicine
were in short supply.
	   In Tegucigalpa, the capital's airport was closed and more than
30,000 people had been evacuated. An equal number had already been
taken to shelters in the nation's second city, San Pedro Sula in
the north.
	   In small coastal communities near San Pedro Sula army troops and
fire fighters moved in with boats to rescue people still clinging
to roof tops
	   Clara Bonilla, a 31-year-old mother, spent the night in a school
bus near San Pedro Sula with her four children.
	   ``It got very cold in the night, and no one has given us much
help,'' Bonilla said as she clutched her youngest daughter.

Over 300,000 gather to remember Yitzhak Rabin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Over 300,000 Israelis gathered Saturday
in the plaza where Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated three years ago,
to remember the slain prime minister and express support for the
Mideast peace process he began.
	   Israeli entertainers sang peace songs and politicians praised
his efforts to make peace with the Palestinians.
	   ``Rabin stood before a nation filled with doubt and didn't
hesitate for a minute,'' said former Prime Minister Shimon Peres,
who served as Rabin's foreign minister and later as Israel's
premier.
	   ``Rabin's way won't be abandoned,'' Peres said.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also praised his one-time
political nemesis.
	   ``I share the deep sorrow and horror of every Israeli citizen at
Rabin's murder,'' Netanyahu said in Jerusalem.
	   Rabin was assassinated by a right-wing Jewish extremist during a
peace rally on November 4, 1995 at the same Tel Aviv plaza where
Saturday's rally was held. Yigal Amir, then a 25 year-old religious
law student, fired three bullets into Rabin. Amir, who is serving
life in prison, confessed to the attack and said he did it to put
an end to Rabin's land-for-peace policies with the Palestinians.
	   Organizers of the annual event said at least 300,000 people had
filled the plaza, now named Rabin Square, for one of the largest
public gatherings in Israel's history.
	   A state memorial attended by Rabin's family and government
officials will be held Sunday at Rabin's grave in Jerusalem.
Israel's parliament, the Knesset also plans to hold a special
session in memory of the former prime minister, defense minister
and Israeli war hero.

Algerian president announces new date for elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with president rolling back election date, ADDS
byline &QL; 
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ President Liamine Zeroual, apparently
responding to requests from opposition parties, said Saturday he
had rolled back until April the date for elections to replace him.
	   In a nationwide televised speech, Zeroual did not explain the
reasons for the delay. But many opposition parties, including one
from his ruling coalition, have argued that a February date _ as
originally planned _ did not give them sufficient preparation time.
	   Zeroual, 57, a retired general who also serves as defense
minister, was elected to the presidency in November 1995 _ the
nation's first pluralistic vote for president. His five-year term
expires in the year 2000.
	   But he announced in September that he would cut short his term
in order to try to create ``a climate favorable to the alternation
of power.''
	   Zeroual has been unable to quell an Islamic insurgency that
began in 1992 after the government canceled parliamentary elections
that an Islamic party was set to win. At least 75,000 people have
died in the violence.
	   His decision to leave office early has also been seen as the
result of a power struggle in which military hardliners opposed his
overtures to Islamic leaders.
	   In the latest violence, armed assailants killed six civilians in
southern Algeria, the security services said Saturday. Witnesses
said the victims had their throats slit and their bodies mutilated.
	   The security services said in a brief statement that the
massacre occurred on Friday in the southern region of Medea, 100
kms (62.5 miles) south of Algiers.
	   No further details were available. The statement described the
bloodshed as a ``cowardly'' attack.
	   Nobody claimed responsibility, but such attacks are blamed by
authorities on the Armed Islamic Group, the most active militant
group in the insurgency.
	   Saturday's edition of the pro-government newspaper Jeune
independant claimed that the Armed Islamic Group had lost 80
percent of its fighters due to the violence. The newspaper
concluded that the depleted group was now on the brink of defeat.
	   There was no immediate reaction to the report from authorities
or Islamic militants.

Flowers and quiet tears as Swedes mourn teen-age fire victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with six grafs to ADD ages of identified victims. &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By JAN M. OLSEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Forensic experts examining heavily
burned bodies were able Saturday to identify more of the 60
youngsters _ some of them not yet teen-agers _ who died in a dance
hall fire, but the catastrophe's most tormenting question was still
unanswered.
	   How could it happen; what caused the flames that raced through a
hall packed far beyond capacity, blocking one of the exits and
forcing panicked teen-agers to flee down the one remaining
staircase and leap out of second-story windows?
	   ``As long as the technicians haven't established the cause of
the fire, we don't know if it's arson or not,'' Goteborg chief
prosecutor Ulf Noren said Saturday evening.
	   Earlier in the day, Noren had said it was a ``50-50'' chance
that the fire was arson, prompting wide speculation that
authorities had tracked down new clues. But Noren later retracted
the remark, saying he'd meant only that no possibilities were being
excluded.
	   As investigators worked to find the cause, examiners identified
another 22 of the bodies, bringing the total to 40, and officials
said 49 people were released from hospital.
	   Authorities late Saturday released a list of names and birth
years of 37 of the dead. None was older than 20 and one, Jasmin
Shaker, was 11 or 12.
	   Of the 162 people who suffered non-fatal injuries in the
Thursday night fire, 76 remain hospitalized. Most of the victims
were immigrants or of immigrant parentage, from countries including
Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Ethiopia and current and former Yugoslavia.
	   The first call alerting authorities to the fire was made in
heavily accented Swedish and that, combined with noise and the
caller's distress, delayed the fire squads' response by several
minutes.
	   Per-Olof Ortgren of Goteborg's emergency services line said the
call was so hard to understand that it took three minutes for
workers to figure out what was going on and where to send fire
trucks.
	   The first fire trucks and rescue squads were on the scene six
minutes after the call was received, Ortgren told a news
conference. He and other officials declined to comment on whether a
quicker response could have saved any of the mostly immigrant
victims.
	   But the minutes of delay felt endless to those caught in the
terror of the fire and survivors have spoken angrily of what they
saw as a slow and even obstructive response.
	   ``No help. No police. No firemen,'' 17-year-old Zuhir Hersi, one
of the disc jockeys at the bash said Friday, hours after the blaze
exploded. ``Just kids helping kids.''
	   And once the squads arrived, the kids were then blocked from
helping, they say.
	   ``We could have saved more young people if only police hadn't
stopped us,'' Mohanned Hussein was quoted as saying by the
newspaper Expressen.
	   On Saturday, hundreds of people stood quietly outside the gutted
building amid flowers and candles as they attempted to come to
grips with catastrophe.
	   In the parking lot that a day before had been a tumult of
ambulances and screams, mourners had laid a 30-meter-long
(100-foot-long) pile of bouquets, candles and cards of remembrance.
	   The cards' inscriptions were brief _ ``I will see you in
heaven,'' ``We miss you'' _ and the people who stood reading them
also had few words.
	   ``I just wanted to show my sympathy. I think about them. There's
nothing else we can do,'' said Caroline Ericsson, who didn't know
any of the fire's victims.
	   ``It's damn difficult,'' said Connie Mesfin, who said she lost a
friend in the blaze.
	   Lasse Gustafsson, a former Goteborg firefighter severely
disfigured in an explosion, also came to the club site to try to
show the victims' relatives and friends that spirit can help them
pull through despair.
	   ``I can't give them hope. Consolation is enough,'' he said, as
people nearby cast uneasy glances at his scars.
	   Many of those injured in the blaze may have to endure similar
shocked looks the rest of their lives. Authorities say the
explosive fire quickly raised the temperature in the hall to 600
degrees (1,100 F).
	   The hall was packed far beyond its capacity. Licensed to hold a
maximum of 150, the hall held at least 250 and perhaps as many as
400 when the fire hit.
	   One of the two exit stairways was blocked by fire and there were
conflicting statements from witnesses as to whether the fire came
up the stairs from a lower level, or whether it spread there after
breaking out in the second-floor rooms.
	   The worst previous fire disaster in modern Sweden was in 1978 in
Boraas, when 20 people died in a hotel fire. Goteborg, Sweden's
second-largest city with about 435,000 people, is 500 kilometers
(300 miles) southwest of Stockholm.

Real Madrid trounces Extremadura 5-1 to go top of table
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 2-2 draw between Celta and Racing de Santander;
half time 2-1 advantage of FC Barcelona over Real Sociedad;
CORRECTS Mallorca total points to 15 sted 16 &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP)_ Real Madrid brushed aside doubts about
recent irregular play trouncing lowly Extremadura 5-1 Saturday in
the 8th-round of the Spanish soccer league, and snatching the top
spot from Mallorca that has yet to play.
	   Robert Jarni of Croatia scored Madrid's first goal in the first
minute. Alaves fans contested the second goal headed by Brazilian
Savio in the 22nd minute, but there was no confusion when Fernando
Hierro successfully converted a penalty to put Madrid three up in
the 37th minute.
	   After the break Croatian Davor Suker continued the punishment
sending a looping goal over the 'keeper to make the score 4-0 in
the 59th minute.
	   Sloppy defending by Madrid defense allowed Carlos Alejandro Dure
to score a compensation goal for Extremadura in the 66th, but
Clarence Seerdorf of Holland twisted in the knife again to make it
5-1 just before the final whistle blew.
	   Madrid consequently jumped to the No. 1 spot with 17 points, two
ahead of Mallorca that is due to play its 8th-round game against
Deportivo de la Coruna on Sunday.
	   Also Saturday Celta added an extra point to notch up a season's
total of 14 points after drawing 2-2 away against Racing de
Santander.
	   Celta went ahead just before the break with a goal from Juan
Sanchez until Victor Sanchez equalized eight minutes after the
teams came back on the field.
	   A 77nd minute goal from Rafael Berges appeared to guarantee
Celta victory, but Sanchez equalized again for Racing in the 86th
with a penalty kick.
	   Meanwhile, FC Barcelona with 13 points after the 7th round, was
looking strong going into the break of Saturday's 8th-round match
2-1 up against Real Sociedad.
	   The underdogs went ahead in the 24th minute with a goal from
Yugoslav Darko Kovacevic but Brazilian star Rivaldo equalized in
the 32nd and fellow countryman Sonny Anderson turned around the
advantage to Barcelona's favor in the 37th.
	   Further down the table _ right at the bottom _ Oliverio 'Oli'
Alvarez' goal against Salamanca in the 55th minute was enough to
give struggling Betis its second victory of the season.
	   The win coincided with Javier Clemente's return to Spanish
soccer as Betis coach, less than two months after being sacked from
the national squad.
	   It was greeted with great enthusiasm by the home crowd, hopeful
that the team which boasts such stars as Brazil's Denilson and
Nigerian international Finidi George, was finally putting an end to
its nightmare start to the season.
	   Also Saturday, mid-table Atletico de Madrid recovered from last
week's embarrassing 4-0 defeat by Mallorca and survived the absence
of its injured hero Francisco `Kiko' Navaez to score a
tripled-headed 3-0 victory over Alaves.
	   The party began in the 7th minute with a header from Kiko's
replacement up front Jose Mari Romero.
	   Stefano Torrisi of Italy knocked in the second in similar
fashion in the 18th minute and Fernando Correa of Argentina headed
the score to 3-0 in the last few seconds of the game.
	   In a match littered with yellow cards, Atletico's Vladimir
Jugovic of Yugoslavia was sent off after receiving his second in
the 33rd minute. Alaves remained one man up until a red card sent
off Jorge Azcoitia in the 73rd.
	   In other late games Saturday Zaragoza was hosting Valencia and
Athletic de Bilbao took on Espanyol.
	   The remainder of the 8th-round matches due Sunday promised two
lower-half battles with Vallarreal playing Tenerife while
Valladolid facing Oviedo.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ At least 231 people have been
confirmed dead in Honduras from tropical depression Mitch, bringing
the storm's death toll in the region to 357, the National Emergency
Commission said Saturday.
	   Mitch _ once one of the strongest hurricanes to hit the
Caribbean _ was downgraded to tropical depression status but
continued to dump heavy rain on the region, causing extensive
flooding.
	   Authorities in neighboring Nicaragua reported 121 dead from
heavy rains and flash flooding there. Another 151 people are listed
as missing in Nicaragua, the National Civil Defense System
reported.
	   Dozens of houses were washed away, seven of Tegucigalpa's ten
bridges were knocked out and patients were evacuated from the third
floor of the city's Social Security hospital after the Rio Grande
river overflowed its banks Saturday.
	   Failing communications prevented authorities from issuing damage
estimates, but the National Emergency Commission said a total of
231 people were confirmed dead in Honduras.
	   Hundreds of thousands of people in the two countries have fled
or lost their homes.

Ecuador deports to Egypt a man wanted for the Luxor massacre
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Ecuador has deported to Egypt an alleged
extremist wanted for the Luxor massacre which killed 62 people last
year, the Egyptian government announced Saturday.
	   Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif told Egypt's official
Middle East News Agency that President Hosni Mubarak had disclosed
the deportation in an interview with French newspapers editors at
the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheik.
	   ``President Mubarak revealed that Ecaudor had arrested one of
the people who participated in planning the terrorist operation
that took place in Luxor and has handed him over to the Egyptian
authorities,'' el-Sherif said.
	   Mubarak did not name the militant nor did he say when the hand
over took place.
	   But Colombian and Ecuadorian authorities have said they detained
an Egyptian passport-holder called Mohammed Abid Abdel-Aal.
	   The Colombian state security agency told The Associated Press
that Abdel-Aal, 37, was arrested at a bus terminal in the capital,
Bogota, on Oct. 17.
	   The security agency described him as a ``highly dangerous
terrorist'' and leading member of the Egyptian militant group,
al-Gamaa al-Islamiya or Islamic Group.
	   The Columbian authorities deported him to Ecuador, from where he
had come.
	   Security forces in the Ecuadorian capital, Quito, detained
Abdel-Aal on his arrival by plane.
	   Ecuadorian police say Abdel-Aal was deported on Oct. 25, but did
not say to which country he was sent.
	   In the Luxor massacre of Nov. 17, six Muslim militants shot dead
58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians. The Islamic Group claimed
responsibility for the incident, which took the heaviest death toll
for a single attack since Muslim extremists began a campaign to
topple the secular government in 1992.

	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Forensic experts Saturday identified
more of the 60 youngsters _ some of them not yet teen-agers _ who
died in a dance hall fire, but the question of how the catastrophe
could happen remains unanswered.
	   Investigators still don't know what caused the flames that raced
through the overcrowded hall, blocked one of the exits and forced
panicked teen-agers to flee down the one remaining staircase and
leap out of second-story windows.
	   ``As long as the technicians haven't established the cause of
the fire, we don't know if it's arson or not,'' Goteborg chief
prosecutor Ulf Noren said Saturday evening.
	   Earlier in the day, Noren had said it was a ``50-50'' chance
that the fire was arson, prompting wide speculation that
authorities had tracked down new clues. But Noren later retracted
the remark, saying he'd meant only that no possibilities were being
excluded.
	   As investigators worked to find the cause, examiners identified
another 22 of the bodies, bringing the total to 40, and officials
said 49 people were released from hospital.
	   Authorities late Saturday released a list of names and birth
years for 37 of the dead. None was older than 20 and one, Jasmin
Shaker, was 11 or 12.

Algerian president announces new date for elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with further details of speech &QL; 
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ President Liamine Zeroual, apparently
responding to requests from opposition parties, said Saturday he
had rolled back until April the date for elections to replace him.
	   In a nationwide televised speech, Zeroual did not explain the
reasons for the delay. But many opposition parties, including one
from his ruling coalition, have argued that a February date _ as
originally planned _ did not give them sufficient preparation time.
	   Zeroual, 57, a retired general who also serves as defense
minister, was elected to the presidency in November 1995 _ the
nation's first pluralistic vote for president. His five-year term
expires in the year 2000.
	   But he announced in September that he would cut short his term
to create ``a climate favorable to the alternation of power.''
	   Zeroual has been unable to quell an Islamic insurgency that
began in 1992 after the government canceled parliamentary elections
an Islamic party was set to win. At least 75,000 people have died
in the violence.
	   His decision to leave office early has also been seen as the
result of a power struggle in which military hardliners opposed his
overtures to Islamic leaders.
	   Many opposition groups have been pushing for a postponement of
the elections, including the National Democratic Rally party, which
forms part of Zeroual's government.
	   Zeroual reiterated Saturday that he had no intention of seeking
re-election.
	   In his 30-minute speech, to mark the 44th anniversary of the
start of Algeria's war of independence, Zeroual hailed the
``martyrs'' who died in the fight against France.
	   And he referred to the victims of the Islamic insurgency as
``victims of duty.''
	   Algeria ``is determined to eliminate terrorism and rip out its
roots,'' he said.
	   Adding to Zeroual's woes is the current climate of labor
instability, with seven newspapers on strike. University teachers
are also striking, and steelworkers are threatening to walk out.
	   Seven privately-owned newspapers have been striking for more
than two weeks to protest an ultimatum from state-owned printers to
four of the papers demanding they pay back debts or not be printed.
	   The ultimatum is seen as the result of articles that led to the
October resignations of Algeria's justice minister, Mohamed Adami,
and Zeroual's top aide, Mohamed Betchine
	   The articles, printed mainly by El Watan and Le Matin, accused
Betchine of abuse of power and questioned Adami's morals.
	   Zeroual defended Betchine and Adami, and said the accusations
had to stop.
	   ``Democracy isn't about rumors, insults or anarchy,'' he said.
``We must preserve freedom of expression. But this liberty cannot
mean attacking the honor of people.''
	   In the country's latest violence, assailants killed six
civilians in southern Algeria Friday. Witnesses said the victims
had their throats slit and their bodies mutilated.
	   Nobody claimed responsibility, but such attacks are blamed by
authorities on the Armed Islamic Group, the most active militant
group in the insurgency.
	   Saturday's edition of the pro-government newspaper Jeune
independant claimed that the Armed Islamic Group had lost 80
percent of its fighters due to the violence and was on the brink of
defeat.
	   There was no immediate reaction to the report from authorities
or Islamic militants.

Britain sends warship to Honduras
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Ministry of Defense said that a British
warship was Saturday sent to Honduras after a request for
assistance from the Central American country battered by Hurricane
Mitch.
	   The Royal Navy Type 22 frigate HMS Sheffield, which is
permanently stationed in the West Indies, would arrive in Honduran
waters on Sunday, a spokesman for the ministry, speaking on terms
of customary anonymity, said.
	   ``We received a request from the Honduran authorities today for
assistance with humanitarian aid in the wake of Hurricane Mitch,
and the HMS Sheffield has been deployed,'' the spokesman said.
	   HMS Sheffield, which carries a Lynx helicopter and nearly 300
personnel, had already been sent near the Central American coast in
case the former British colony of Belize requested assistance.
	   Officials in Honduras, Nicaragua and Mexico on Saturday raised
the death toll from Hurricane Mitch to 306, with at least 231 of
the dead from Honduras.

Feyenoord loses first league match of the season, PSV thrashes
</HEADLINE>
Sparta

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Feyenoord Rotterdam lost its first
Dutch Honor Division match of the season Saturday, slipping to a
2-1 home defeat against AZ Alkmaar _ a team trained by former
Feyenoord boss Willem van Hanegem.
	   The defeat left Feyenoord level on points at the top of the
league with FC Twente, which won 3-0 Friday at Fortuna Sittard. The
Rotterdam club has played one match fewer than Twente and has a
superior goal difference.
	   Victory took AZ, which was promoted from the Dutch first
division at the end of last season, to sixth place. It was also
sweet revenge for Van Hanegem, who was fired by Feyenoord in 1996.
	   Michael Buskermolen opened the scoring for the Alkmaar side in
the 43rd minute before Dennis den Turk doubled the lead on the
hour. Feyenoord captain Jean Paul van Gastel pulled back a goal in
the 75th minute, setting up an exciting last 15 minutes, but
Feyenoord could not find the equalizer.
	   In Eindhoven, PSV thrashed Sparta Rotterdam 4-0 with Ruud van
Nistelrooij scoring a first-half hattrick. Belgian international
Luc Nilis also scored before the break to give Bobby Robson's side
just its fourth win of the season and lift it to ninth place.
	   In other matches, Willem II Tilburg could only draw 1-1 at MVV
Maastricht while SC Heerenveen beat Vitesse Arnhem 2-1 and Cambuur
Leeuwarden downed NAC Breda 3-1.
	   Ajax Amsterdam takes on NEC Nijmegen Sunday knowing that a win
would put it level on points with arch-rival Feyenoord.

	   ROME (AP) _ Two spectacular goals by young Argentine striker
Hernan Jorge Crespo gave Parma a 2-0 upset victory against league
leader Fiorentina in Saturday's seventh-round games of the Italian
Serie A.
	   In the other ``big match'' of the day AS Roma trounced Udinese
4-0 on two goals by its young captain Francesco Totti, one by
Brazilian forward Paulo Sergio and another by midfielder Eusebio Di
Francesco.
	   The third season win lifted the Parma team closer to the top of
the first division standings (12 points, 3-3-1) while Fiorentina
suffered the second upset of the campaign as its stellar forward
line led by Gabriel Batistuta and Edmundo was shut out by the
league's strongest defense.
	   Roma vaulted to 13 points, two points short from Fiorentina,
following its fourth win in as many games on the home field of the
Olympic stadium.
	   Roma dominated the game pressing on the attack throughout and
producing an impressive streak of scoring chances. Overly-defensive
Udinese did not get any and its Brazilian forward Amoroso, who had
scored six goals in the previous rounds, left the field frustrated
during the second half.
	   Di Francesco gave Roma a 1-0 first-half lead with a precise
diagonal shot in the 44th minute.
	   Totti made it two with a powerful left drive in the 52nd. It was
a spectacular goal which carried away Roman fans.
	   Roma's third goal came nine minutes later on a diving header by
Paulo Sergio, fed by Cameroon defender Pierre Wome.
	   Totti scored his second goal and Roma's fourth converting a
penalty kick in the 71st minute.
	   It was Totti's fourth goal this season and a personal revenge
for the young forward who had missed a penalty in Roma's undeserved
loss to AC Milan last Sunday.
	   Crespo, who had not scored in the previous six rounds, opened
the scoring for Parma in the 36th minute, diving to head into the
Florentine net a perfect cross by Italian International Enrico
Chiesa.
	   Again fed by Chiesa, the 23-year-old Argentine forward made it
2-0 in the 52nd with a powerful right drive which sent the ball
just under the bar.
	   Crespo received a standing ovation by Parma fans _ often
critical of the Argentine player _ when he left the field in the
58th, replaced by veteran Abel Balbo.
	   Despite defeat, Fiorentina still sat atop the serie A standings
with 15 points.
	   However, defending league champion Juventus of Turin, with 13
points in six rounds, could take over the leadership following
Sunday's games.
	   The Turin team hosts Sampdoria at Delle Alpi arena.
	   Low-ranked Bologna downed next-to-last Venezia 2-0 in another of
the three games played Saturday because of UEFA Cup commitments of
some Italian teams.
	   Fiorentina, starting the best Serie A offense with 13 goals, was
unable to break through Parma's defense which included such stars
as France's World Champion Lilian Thuram, Argentine veteran Nestor
Sensini and Italian inrternational Fabio Cannavaro.
	   Parma, upset by underdog Perugia in the previous round, allowed
only two goals in seven games, while scoring six.
	   Batistuta, the leading league striker with 8 goals, had no
scoring chances throughout the game as his much-prolific
partnership with Edmundo did not work at Parma's Tardini stadium.
	   The Argentine striker could only lament a couple of questionable
interventions by Parma defenders inside the penalty area.
	   The only threat for Parma's goalie Gianluigi Buffon came on a
second-half long-distance shot by Portuguese midfielder Rui Costa.
Buffon, Italy's national team keeper, dived and saved.
	   In Venice, forward Jonathan Binotto put Bologna in front with a
lob from the penalty area edge in the 71st minute.
	   Brazilian Eriberto scored Bologna's second goal in injury time
(94th) kicking the ball into an empty net following a quick
counter-attack.
	   Venezia's goalie Massimo Taibi had left his goal unguarded in a
futile offensive raid in occasion of a last-minute corner kick in
the opposite penalty area.
	   The young Brazilian started the action in his own midfield,
resisted tackles of two defenders and kicked in at ease.
	   The victory on the road gave Bologna nine points, or 2-3-2.
Venezia was left with two points (0-2-5).

Mandela at odds over deputy president Mbeki over apartheid report

 &UR; By ANDREW SELSKY &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela
acknowledged Saturday the African National Congress violated human
rights during apartheid, setting him at odds with his deputy
president over a report that has divided much of South Africa.
	   The disagreement stems from Thursday's release of the report by
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on horrors committed during
apartheid. Rather than act as a salve and an aid to reconciliation,
the report has caused divisiveness, even among former
comrades-in-arms who fought apartheid.
	   As expected, the report called apartheid a ``crime against
humanity.'' But it also blamed the ANC for gross human rights
violations during its anti-apartheid struggle, saying the group
tortured suspected spies and dissidents and killed innocent
civilians with land mines and bombs. Some suspected traitors were
killed in the ANC's camps abroad.
	   Mbeki _ who became ANC president last year and will likely be
elected South Africa's next president in 1999 _ took a hard line
Saturday against the report, and indicated all ANC members must do
the same.
	   ``No member of ... the ANC can ever concur with the scurrilous
attempts to criminalize the liberation struggle ... as gross human
rights violations,'' Mbeki's office said in a statement.
	   But Mandela said that while the ANC had fought a just cause, it
had indeed committed gross violations of human rights.
	   ``Nobody can deny it because some people have died in our camps
and that's what the TRC report said,'' Mandela said, the South
African Press Association reported.
	   Mandela, speaking in the central town of Kimberley while on an
election campaign swing for the ANC, said he was satisfied the
Truth Commission had done a good job, SAPA reported.
	   The ANC had asked a court early Thursday to block the report. A
judge turned down the petition and authorized its release later
that day.
	   The ANC's legal action outraged the Truth Commission chairman,
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, one of South Africa's most prominent
anti-apartheid activists.
	   Tutu expressed worry the ANC would turn dictatorial.
	   ``There is no way in which you can assume that yesterday's
oppressed will not become tomorrow's oppressors,'' Tutu was quoted
as saying in early editions of the Sunday Times.
	   ``We have seen it happen all over the world and we shouldn't be
surprised if it happens here,'' the Johannesburg newspaper quoted
Tutu as saying.
	   He called on churches and the media to keep a vigilant watch on
the ruling party.
	   Mbeki, meanwhile, denied a report that Mandela would have been
content for the Truth Commission's findings to have been released
as written and that he had ``overruled'' Mandela, insisting the
party seek the court injunction.
	   Before the ANC went to court, ANC Secretary-General Kgalema
Motlanthe briefed Mandela on the decision, but ``Mandela was not
expected to and did not express an opinion on the intentions of the
ANC,'' Mbeki's statement said.
	   The Truth Commission report was the culmination of 2 1/2 years
of hearings featuring both victims and perpetrators of apartheid.

violations during its anti-apartheid struggle, saying the group
tortured suspected spies and dissidents and killed innocent
civilians with land mines and bombs. Some suspected traitors were
killed in the ANC's camps abroad.
	   Mbeki _ who became ANC president last year and will likely be
elected South Africa's next president in 1999 when Mandela retires
_ took a hard line Saturday against the report, and indicated all
ANC members must do the same.

Vijay takes level road, stays in lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Fiji's Vijay Singh hit only six fairways from the
tee, but managed to patch together another round of even-par 70 and
clung to a one-stroke lead after Saturday's third round of the U.S.
Tour Championship.
	   Singh finished with a 7-under 203 and was just ahead of Jim
Furyk and Hal Sutton heading into the final 18 holes over a tough
East Lake Golf Club.
	   ``I just hope I play better than I did today,'' Singh said.
``Anybody who shoots a low score ... I think the winning score will
not be 7-under, but 8-under or 9-under or more.''
	   But that doesn't give just anybody a chance.
	   Only two other players are within striking distance of the
leaders. Jesper Parnevik birdied the 18th for a 3-under 67 and put
him at 207, four strokes off the lead.
	   Justin Leonard had a 68 and was at 208, historically a good
place for him to be. He's won all three of his tournaments _
including The Players Championship in March _ when he trailed by
five strokes going into the final round.
	   ``I'm probably going to need a little help,'' Leonard said.
	   At the rate Singh is going, he may get it.
	   Singh, who shattered the competitive course record of 63 in the
first round, has struggled off the tee over the past two rounds.
Still, he has managed to catch decent lies out of rough so thick
that at one point Saturday, three marshals couldn't find his ball.
When they did, one of them stepped on it.
	   ``I didn't play good enough to shoot 70,'' Singh said. ``I got
luckier than a lot of other guys who missed the fairway.''
	   Tom Lehman was one of the more unfortunate ones. Needing to win
this week to qualify for the Presidents Cup team, Lehman started
the third round just four off the lead and was right in the mix
when he made the turn.
	   But he made only one par on a back nine that featured a double
bogey, two birdies and one stretch of five straight bogeys. Lehman
chipped in for birdie on the 18th for a 75 that left him at 212,
nine strokes back.
	   In the 12 years of the season-ending Tour Championship, only Tom
Watson in the inaugural year has won start-to-finish. For Singh to
match that feat Sunday, he'll have his work cut out for him.
	   ``You don't want to get too far away from the leader,'' said
Sutton, who shot a 68. ``But it's not going to be an easy place to
lead. If you make some mistakes and get some bogeys, it could be
easy to get frustrated out there _ especially if someone is
throwing down birdies.''
	   For the second day in a row, Singh failed to protect his lead.
	   He made bogey on No. 5 by hitting his drive so far to the right
he nearly went out of bounds. Furyk caught him at 6-under with his
second birdie on the par-3 sixth hole, then surged ahead with two
birdies to make the turn at 8-under.
	   That didn't last long.
	   He couldn't get up-and-down from a greenside bunker at No. 10,
three-putted from about 12 meters (40 feet) on the 11th and made
his third straight bogey from the rough on No. 12. Furyk closed
with a birdie on No. 18, which was playing from only 201 yards (181
meters).
	   ``I tried to stay patient and not get too upset with myself,''
Furyk said. ``When you play a course this tough, you're going to
make some bogeys.''
	   Defending champion David Duval had another exasperating day on
the greens, and another 69 that left him 10 strokes back but in
good shape to win the money title. He's tied for 14th and needs
only to finish in the top 24.
	   Tiger Woods showed up on the first tee with a huge afro wig to
celebrate Halloween, and two holes later celebrated his first
birdie of the tournament. He finished with a 69 to move up to a tie
for 26th in the field of the top 30 money-winners on the American
tour.

Nigeria beats Ghana to win African title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABEOKUTA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria won the inaugural African
women's soccer championships on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over
Ghana.
	   Congo placed third by beating Cameroon 8-7 in penalties after a
3-3 tie during 90 minutes of play.
	   Nigeria dominated the competition by outscoring its opponents
28-0. Both Nigeria and Ghana have claimed spots in the Women's
World Cup finals next year in the United States.
	   Saturday's games were played in the town of Abeokuta, about 50
kilometers (30 miles) north of the commercial capital of Lagos. The
competition, Africa's first female continental championships, was
contested by seven teams and was marred by the failure of
qualifiers Lesotho to send a squad.

Iraq breaks off dealings with U.N. Special Commission

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a move that could provoke a showdown
with the United Nations, Iraq announced Saturday that it would no
longer allow U.N. weapons inspectors to work in the country.
	   The decision by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his top
advisers exempted only a handful of experts from the International
Atomic Energy Agency, who monitor suspected nuclear sites.
	   The move was seen as a response to a U.N. Security Council
decision Friday to review Iraq's progress on eliminating prohibited
weapons.
	   Although it pledged a ``comprehensive review,'' the council did
not accede to Iraq's demand that the review lead directly to the
removal of the sweeping trade sanctions imposed in 1990 after
Baghdad's forces invaded Kuwait.
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until the Special Commission
certifies that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq insists it has done so, but the commission says Baghdad
continues to hide information on weapons, especially those with
biological and chemical agents.
	   The Iraqi statement said the ban would continue ``until the
United Nations looks at the issue in an honest and positive way,
leading to Iraq's right to the lifting of the unjust sanctions.''
	   Iraq also insisted that the Security Council fire Richard
Butler, chief of the U.N. Special Commission that oversees weapons
inspections. Iraq has long accused Butler of working on behalf of
the United States to prolong sanctions.
	   It remained unclear if Saturday's decision would provoke the
United States and Britain to threaten military action against
Baghdad, as they did earlier this year after the Iraqi regime
prevented U.N. inspectors from entering Saddam's presidential
palaces.
	   In New York, the U.N. Security Council called a meeting for
later Saturday to discuss the move.
	   Diplomats said the 15-member council was considering a press
statement which would condemn the Iraqi action and demand that
Baghdad reverse it unconditionally and immediately. The statement
would also reiterate the council's offer to review Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions if it resumes cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors, the diplomats said.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Iraq's move was ``a
serious breach and a major violation'' of council resolutions.
	   In Washington, the National Security Council met Saturday
afternoon. ``We view this as a serious matter,'' said spokesman
David Leavy. ``We are currently consulting with allies and with
officials at the United Nations.''
	   In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said it ``deplores''
Iraq's decision. ``France insists that Iraq resume its full and
total cooperation with the United Nations,'' the statement added.
	   In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said on customary
condition of anonymity that the decision were true, ``it will be
totally unacceptable.''
	   ``Iraq is again flouting the Security Council resolutions and
the memorandum of understanding it signed with the U.N.
secretary-general,'' the spokesman said, referring to the February
agreement negotiated by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   The deal defused the threat of airstrikes, but the United States
still maintains considerable firepower in the Gulf.
	   Saddam Hussein's decision Saturday caused jitters in Baghdad.
Currency traders said the already depressed Iraqi dinar fell from
1660 to the dollar to 1760 from within minutes of the announcement.
	   Officials at the U.N. Special Commission in Baghdad declined to
take calls and issued no statements Saturday.
	   Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told reporters that
the country would stand firm.
	   ``This is the decision of the people of Iraq and the leadership
of Iraq to save the sovereignty of Iraq and the right of the people
to live,'' Saleh said.
	   The sanctions have severely damaged the Iraqi economy by
limiting the sale of oil, banning air travel and prohibiting most
other financial dealings with Iraq.
	   Saturday's decision deepens a dispute that began Aug. 5, when
Iraq announced that teams from the Special Commission and the
atomic agency could no longer carry out spot inspections. But Iraq
allowed both groups to continue long-term monitoring, often done
with cameras and sensors, at previously identified weapons sites.
	   Now the commission must ``stop all their activities inside
Iraq'' that relate to destroying biological and chemical weapons
and long-range missiles, the statement said. Atomic agency
monitors, however, will be allowed to continue working.
	   The Iraqi Information Ministry issued a statement late Saturday
saying the government was not asking the roughly 120 U.N. monitors
and support staff to leave Iraq. It added that the monitoring
cameras and sensors installed at weapons sites could continue to
operate.
	   The statement insisted that Iraq has ``complied with all related
resolutions'' of the Security Council. It blamed ``America and its
agents'' for blocking the lifting of sanctions.
	   ``Iraq was disappointed because lifting of the sanctions didn't
go in a normal fashion,'' the statement said. It added that the
Security Council decision Friday had been made under ``clear
pressure from America.''

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ At least 231 people have been
confirmed dead in Honduras from former hurricane Mitch, bringing
the storm's death toll in the region to 362, the National Emergency
Commission said Saturday.
	   Authorities in neighboring Nicaragua reported 121 dead from
heavy rains and flash flooding there. Another 151 people are listed
as missing in Nicaragua, the National Civil Defense System
reported.
	   Mitch _ once one of the strongest hurricanes to hit the
Caribbean _ was downgraded to tropical depression status but
continued to dump heavy rain on the region.
	   One hundred and thirty-one people were reported killed in
Tegucigalpa after floodwaters rose to the third floor of some
buildings in the Honduran capital Saturday.
	   Dozens of houses were washed away, seven of the Tegucigalpa's
ten bridges were knocked out and patients were evacuated from the
third floor of the city's Social Security hospital after the Rio
Grande river overflowed its banks Saturday.
	   Hundreds of thousands of people in the two countries had fled or
lost their homes. Failing communications prevented authorities from
issuing damage estimates, but banana producers said they had lost
their entire crop.
	   ``Superhuman efforts are under way to aid the flood victims,''
said Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse, after he traveled to
the city's international airport aboard a U.S. military aircraft
based at the nearby Palmerola airbase. The terminal is closed to
regular air traffic. Flores Facusse declared the city ``a disaster
zone.''
	   At sea in the Caribbean, two U.S. Coast Guard C-130 planes
continued the search for a tourist schooner with 31 people that had
reported being rocked by then-Hurricane Mitch on Tuesday.
	   By late Saturday, Mitch's winds _ once near 180 mph (288 kph) _
had dropped to 35 mph (55 kph) and the storm was located about 75
miles (120 kms) south of Santa Rosa de Copan, Honduras, moving west
at 7 mph (11 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center reported.
	   Heavy rain continued to fall in Tegucigalpa and parts of
northern Nicaragua, but weather began to clear on Honduras'
northern coast, lashed for much of the week by rains and high
winds.
	   Neighboring El Salvador _ where four people died in flash floods
_ declared a state of emergency Saturday, as did Guatemala, where
five people died when floodwaters swept away their homes. Mexico
reported one death from Mitch on Monday.
	   Police fanned out across Tegucigalpa to stem what National
Police Chief Col. Napoleon Flores Ponce said were hundreds of
people robbing stores in the capital. Police had orders to ``take
drastic action'' to stop the looting, he told a local radio
station.
	   ``Almost everything is damaged or destroyed and it will be
difficult to recover from such a tragedy,'' said Col. Anael Perez,
spokesman for Honduras' Permanent Emergency Commission, describing
the damage in this country of 6 million.
	   The Coast Guard reported that two Swiss citizens were rescued
from a life raft after their 33-foot yacht (10.5-meter) yacht went
down Monday in the Caribbean, but there was still no sign of a
258-foot (77-meter) schooner, the Fantome, missing since Tuesday.
	   ``There's still not a lot we can do with the way the weather is
down there,'' said Jeff Hall, spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard.
	   The Antigua-registered Fantome, once owned by Aristotle Onassis,
is operated out of Miami by Windjammer Barefoot Cruises.
	   After dropping its tourist passengers off in Belize Monday
morning, the crew headed toward Roatan Island, off the north coast,
to escape the hurricane _ which for two days was centered near that
island.
	   In their last communication, the crew of the Fantome said they
were experiencing 100-knot winds and 40-degree rolls, said
Windjammer spokesman James Canty.
	   The ship carried an emergency transmitter, but no signal has
been received from that transponder, according to the Coast Guard.
	   While tropical storm warnings were discontinued Saturday, states
of emergency remained in effect in Honduras and Nicaragua.
	   With rainfall of 4 inches (10 cms) an hour at the height of the
storm, downed bridges, rampant rivers, toppled trees and mudslides
had isolated hundreds of communities where food, water and medicine
were in short supply.
	   In Tegucigalpa, the capital's airport was closed and more than
30,000 people had been evacuated. An equal number had already been
taken to shelters in the nation's second city, San Pedro Sula in
the north.
	   The British Ministry of Defense said that it sent a Royal Navy
frigate based in the West Indies to Honduras Saturday to help in
assisting flood victims.

Pinochet's wife thanks supporters, says his recovery is slow

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The wife of Gen. Augusto Pinochet on Saturday
thanked those who supported him and said she hoped her husband, who
is hospitalized under guard and barred from leaving, would be able
to return soon to Chile.
	   ``The health of my husband is recovering very slowly because of
the situation he is in,'' a frail-looking Lucia Hiriart told a
brief news conference at a London hotel.
	   Her 82-year-old husband, the former Chilean dictator who
underwent back surgery in a London hospital, was arrested Oct. 16
on a Spanish warrant seeking to extradite him on charges of
genocide and terrorism during his 17-year-rule.
	   Lucia Hiriart, who refused to discuss her husband's legal
situation, told reporters, ``I feel very weak physically and
mentally.''
	   ``The last few days have been very sad for me. Even my own
health physically and mentally has been damaged,'' she said in
Spanish.
	   She was quoted Friday in a Chilean newspaper as asking that
``pressure be made through the governments of the world so he can
be released. ... Humanitarian reasons should take precedence over
anything else.''
	   Spanish prosecutors allege that Pinochet was responsible for up
to 4,000 murders, including at least one in the United States, and
had sent agents to Spain to kill opponents there. He ruled from
1973 until 1990.
	   The Sunday Telegraph reported that Pinochet was arrested while
he was a guest of Britain's Ministry of Defense.
	   ``Pinochet was accompanied by a full military mission who were
in turn accompanied by an MoD (Ministry of Defense) officer,'' the
newspaper quoted Maj. Gen. Alan Sharman, chairman of Britain's
Defense Manufacturers Association, as saying.
	   The Ministry of Defense said Saturday that Pinochet's visit was
unconnected to that of an official Chilean delegation, in Britain
to buy military equipment.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council on Saturday
unanimously condemned Iraq's decision to cut off all dealings with
U.N. weapons inspectors and demanded that Baghdad rescind the
decision immediately and unconditionally.
	   The council called Saturday's announcement from Baghdad ``a
flagrant violation'' of council resolutions and a memorandum of
understanding between Iraq and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
that averted military action against Iraq in February after another
crisis over weapons inspections.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Croatian Robert Jarni scored less than a
minute after kickoff and Madrid got goals from five different
players to rout Extramdura 5-1 Saturday, retaking the Spanish
first-division lead at least for a day.
	   Jarni's countryman Davor Suker also scored as Madrid improved to
5-2-1 and 17 points, two more than Mallorca, which plays its
eighth-round match Sunday when it travels to La Coruna.
	   In other games Saturday, Barcelona moved back into second place
with a 4-1 victory over Real Sociedad. Elsewhere it was: Atletico
Madrid 3, Alaves 0; Athletic Bilbao 2, Espanyol 2; Betis 1,
Salamanca 0; Valencia 4, Zaragoza 1; and Racing Santander 2, Celta
2.
	   In other games Sunday, it is: Villareal vs. Tenerife and
Valladolid vs. Oviedo.
	   At Almendralejo, Jarni's goal put Madrid ahead quickly and Savio
added a controversial header in the 22nd. Fernando Hierro's penalty
made it 3-0 in the 37th.
	   Suker curled another in to make the score 4-0 in the 59th
minute, and, after a sloppy defense allowed Carlos Alejandro Dure
to score a compensation goal for Extremadura in the 66th, Clarence
Seerdorf added the finale just before the final double whistle.
 &UR; Barcelona 4, Real Sociedad 1 &QC; 
	   At Barcelona, Brazilians Rivaldo and Sonny Anderson both scored
a pair to rally Barca after it fell behind early.
	   Yugoslav Darko Kovacevic gave Sociedad the lead in the 24th but
Rivaldo equalized only eight minutes later, and five minutes after
that Anderson chested a ball in to give Barcelona the lead.
	   After the break Rivaldo returned to beat several defenders
before scoring in the 63rd and Anderson added his second in the
87th.
 &UR; Racing 2, Celta 2 &QC; 
	   At Santander, Victor Sanchez scored his second _ a penalty _
with four minutes remaining to earn the draw for Racing and halting
Celta from keeping up with the other front-runners.
	   Juan Sanchez gave Celta the lead just before halftime but Victor
Sanchez equalized eight minutes into the second half.
	   Rafael Berges gave Celta the apparent victory in the 77th before
Victor Sanchez earned Racing the point.
 &UR; Betis 1, Salamanca 0 &QC; 
	   At Seville, Oliverio 'Oli' Alvarez scored in the 55th minute to
give Betis only its second victory of the season and Javier
Clemente a successful debut as its coach after being dismissed as
the Spanish national team coach following the World Cup.
	   The home crowd was ecstatic with the victory, hoping the victory
can turn around a side that includes widely acclaimed Denilson and
Finidi George.
 &UR; Atletico 3, Alaves 0 &QC; 
	   At Madrid, Jose Mari Romero and Italian Stefano Torrisi both
scored in the first 18 minutes and Atletico recovered from last
week's 4-0 embarrassing loss to Mallorca.
	   Romero's header in the seventh and Torrisi's in the 18th spotted
Atletico to a 2-0 lead and Argentine Fernando Correa headed in a
third in the final seconds.
	   The match was littered with yellow cards and Atletico played a
man down for 40 minutes after Vladimir Jugovic of Yugoslavia was
sent off with two in the 33rd minute. The manpower was equalized
when Jorge Azcoitia was ejected with a red in the 73rd.
 &UR; Valencia 4, Zaragoza 1 &QC; 
	   At Zaragoza, three second-half goals in 16 minutes lifted
Valencia just ahead of Zaragoza with 12 points.
	   Romania Adrian Ilie gave Valencia the lead in the second minute
but Kily Gonzalez drew Zaragoza even in the 23rd.
	   In the second half Italian Cristiano Lucarelli scored in the
68th minute, Swede Stefan Schwarz followed in the 79th and Gaizka
Mendieta finished in the 84th.
 &UR; Athletic Bilbao 2, Espanyol 2 &QC; 
	   At Bilbao, Carolos Garcia scored in the first minute of injury
time and Bilbao rallied for the draw after Espanyol midfielder
Moises Arteaga was expelled in the 84th.
	   Paraguayan Miguel Angel Benitez scored twice for Espanyol _ in
the 12th and the 62nd minute, but the original equalizer in the
25th from Joseba Etxeberria kept Athletic in the game.

	   It also reiterated the council's offer to review Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions if it resumes cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, the outgoing council
president, read a press statement to reporters after a one hour, 20
minute meeting of the 15-member council. A press statement reflects
the council's views, but unlike a council resolution, it is not
binding on members.
	   The council agreed on a statement because it wanted to respond
quickly to the Iraqi announcement, but member states have not had a
chance yet to fully assess Baghdad's response.
	   Acting U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh, who assumes the council
presidency on Sunday, said the council would proceed ``on a step by
step basis,'' assess what's happening on the ground and make sure
that inspectors and personnel in Iraq from the U.N. Special
Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency ``are safe
and secure.''
	   ``I want to underscore the unanimous and very solid and very
strong reaction of the council to this really dismaying Iraqi
decision. I think everyone on the council expressed their surprise
and dismay and regret,'' Burleigh said.
	   Asked whether he foresaw military threats from the United States
against Iraq if it doesn't rescind its decision, Burleigh replied:
``I'm not going to comment on that.''
	   While the council was meeting, Iraq's ambassador to the United
Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, said weapons inspectors will be banned from
all installations and monitoring sites in Iraq and should probably
be withdrawn because they have nothing left to do in the country.

	   The latest dispute with Iraq began Aug. 5, when Baghdad
announced that teams from the U.N. special commission and the
atomic agency could no longer carry out surprise inspections. But
Iraq allowed both groups to continue long-term monitoring at
previously identified weapons sites.
	   Hamdoon said weapons inspectors will not be given escorts to go
to monitoring sites _ and will be physically barred if they attempt
to get to any of them. ``They will not be given access to any of
those installations from today on,'' he said.
	   Asked whether the inspectors should be withdrawn, Hamdoon
replied: ``Well I presume because they have nothing more to do in
the country both on the inspections front and also on the
monitoring front.''
	   The Security Council met less than 24 hours after it sent a
letter to Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the broad outlines of a
``comprehensive review'' of U.N. sanctions on Iraq that it was
prepared to launch if Iraq reversed its Aug. 5 ban and allowed a
resumption of weapons inspections.
	   ``It's particularly disappointing that the Iraqis have taken
this step when the council made a clear offer to them to move
forward with a comprehensive review,'' Greenstock said before the
meeting started.
	   But Hamdoon called the comprehensive review offered by the
council ``not helpful'' and ``counterproductive.''
	   Baghdad demanded that the review lead directly to the removal of
sweeping trade sanctions imposed in 1990 after Iraqi forces invaded
Kuwait, sparking the Gulf War _ but the letter that the council
sent to Annan made no mention of lifting sanctions.
	   ``The American delegation made it clear that this whole issue of
review is not about lifting sanctions'' and insisted that any
reference to ending sanctions should not be mentioned, Hamdoon
said. ``And that had, I think, I major impact on the Iraqi
reaction.''
	   ``We have left the door open for the Security Council to review
the status of affairs and to come up with something that Iraq could
deal with,'' he said.
	   Diplomats said the secretary-general's special envoy to Iraq,
Prakash Shah, who is in Bahrain, will be returning to Iraq to
assess the situation. The Indian diplomat has been acting as a
liaison between Annan and Baghdad since the last crisis with Iraq
over weapons inspections ended in February.
	   ``We've always wanted and we still hope that the
secretary-general get more involved and get more active on this
issue. We trust him and we trust his good intentions in trying to
do a good job,'' Hamdoon said.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a move that could provoke a showdown
with the United Nations, Iraq announced Saturday that it would no
longer allow U.N. weapons inspectors to work in the country.
	   The decision by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his top
advisers exempted only a handful of experts from the International
Atomic Energy Agency, who monitor suspected nuclear sites.
	   The move was seen as a response to a U.N. Security Council
decision Friday to review Iraq's progress on eliminating prohibited
weapons.
	   Although it pledged a ``comprehensive review,'' the council did
not accede to Iraq's demand that the review lead directly to the
removal of the sweeping trade sanctions imposed in 1990 after
Baghdad's forces invaded Kuwait.
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until the Special Commission
certifies that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq insists it has done so, but the commission says Baghdad
continues to hide information on weapons, especially those with
biological and chemical agents.
	   The Iraqi statement said the ban would continue ``until the
United Nations looks at the issue in an honest and positive way,
leading to Iraq's right to the lifting of the unjust sanctions.''
	   Iraq also insisted that the Security Council fire Richard
Butler, chief of the U.N. Special Commission that oversees weapons
inspections. Iraq has long accused Butler of working on behalf of
the United States to prolong sanctions.
	   It remained unclear if Saturday's decision would provoke the
United States and Britain to threaten military action against
Baghdad, as they did earlier this year after the Iraqi regime
prevented U.N. inspectors from entering Saddam's presidential
palaces.
	   The U.N. Security Council on Saturday unanimously condemned
Iraq's decision and demanded that Baghdad rescind the decision
immediately and unconditionally.
	   The council called Saturday's announcement from Baghdad ``a
flagrant violation'' of council resolutions and a memorandum of
understanding between Iraq and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
that averted military action against Iraq in February after another
crisis over weapons inspections.
	   It reiterated the council's offer to review Iraq's compliance
with U.N. resolutions if it resumes cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ At least 231 people have been
confirmed dead in Honduras from former hurricane Mitch, bringing
the storm's death toll in the region to 362, the National Emergency
Commission said Saturday.
	   Authorities in neighboring Nicaragua reported 121 dead from
heavy rains and flash flooding there. Another 151 people are listed
as missing, the National Civil Defense System reported.
	   Mitch _ once one of the strongest hurricanes to hit the
Caribbean _ was downgraded to a tropical depression, but continued
to dump heavy rain on the region.
	   At least 131 people were reported killed in Tegucigalpa after
floodwaters rose to the third floor of some buildings in the
Honduran capital Saturday. Army helicopters rescued some flood
victims clinging to rooftops.
	   ``This is a national catastrophe without any comparison,'' said
Gen. Mario Hung Pacheco, head of Honduras' armed forces.
	   Hundreds of houses were washed away, seven of Tegucigalpa's ten
bridges were knocked out and patients were evacuated from the third
floor of the city's Social Security hospital after the Rio Grande
river overflowed its banks Saturday.
	   ``I lost everything, I wasn't able to rescue a thing,'' said
Maria Lopez, 46, whose home near Tegucigalpa's international
airport disappeared without a trace in the flood waters.
	   Hundreds of thousands of people in Honduras and Nicaragua had
fled or lost their homes. Failing communications prevented
authorities from issuing damage estimates _ Honduras'
transportation ministry said almost all the country's roads had
been cut _ but banana producers said they had lost their entire
crop.
	   ``Superhuman efforts are under way to aid the flood victims,''
said Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse, after he traveled to
the city's international airport aboard a U.S. military aircraft
based at the nearby Palmerola airbase. The terminal is closed to
regular air traffic. Flores Facusse declared the city ``a disaster
zone.''
	   Honduran authorities asked the United Nations for aid in
assisting flood victims. Food and medicine were in particularly
short supply. ``The government does not have the capacity to help
all the victims,'' said Health Minister Marco Antonio Rosa.
	   At sea in the Caribbean, two U.S. Coast Guard C-130 planes
continued the search for a tourist schooner with 31 people that had
reported being rocked by then-Hurricane Mitch on Tuesday.
	   By late Saturday, Mitch's winds _ once near 180 mph (288 kph) _
had dropped to 35 mph (55 kph) and the storm was located about 75
miles (120 kms) south of Santa Rosa de Copan, Honduras, moving west
at 7 mph (11 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center reported.
	   Neighboring El Salvador _ where four people died in flash floods
_ declared a state of emergency Saturday, as did Guatemala, where
five people died when floodwaters swept away their homes. Mexico
reported one death from Mitch on Monday.
	   Police fanned out across Tegucigalpa to stem what National
Police Chief Col. Napoleon Flores Ponce said were hundreds of
people robbing stores in the capital. Police had orders to ``take
drastic action'' to stop the looting, he told a local radio
station.
	   The Coast Guard reported that two Swiss citizens were rescued
from a life raft after their 33-foot yacht (10.5-meter) yacht went
down Monday in the Caribbean, but there was still no sign of a
258-foot (77-meter) schooner, the Fantome, missing since Tuesday.
	   The Antigua-registered Fantome, once owned by Aristotle Onassis,
is operated out of Miami by Windjammer Barefoot Cruises.
	   After dropping its tourist passengers off in Belize Monday
morning, the crew headed toward Roatan Island, off the north coast,
to escape the hurricane _ which for two days was centered near that
island.
	   In their last communication, the crew of the Fantome said they
were experiencing 100-knot winds and 40-degree rolls, said
Windjammer spokesman James Canty.
	   The ship carried an emergency transmitter, but no signal has
been received from that transponder, according to the Coast Guard.
	   With rainfall of 4 inches (10 cms) an hour at the height of the
storm, downed bridges, rampant rivers, toppled trees and mudslides
had isolated hundreds of communities where food, water and medicine
were in short supply.
	   A Nicaraguan army helicopter set out to investigate reports that
many more people may have drowned in the northern town of
Posoltega, near the Honduran border, but turned back because of bad
weather.
	   In Tegucigalpa, thousands sought refuge in government shelters.
About 30,000 had been taken Friday to shelters in the nation's
second city, San Pedro Sula in the north.
	   The British Ministry of Defense said that it sent a Royal Navy
frigate based in the West Indies to Honduras Saturday to help in
assisting flood victims.
	   In small coastal communities near San Pedro Sula army troops and
fire fighters moved in with small boats to rescue people still
clinging to roof tops.
	   Clara Bonilla, a 31-year-old mother, spent the night in a school
bus near San Pedro Sula with her four children.
	   ``It got very cold in the night, and no one has given us much
help,'' Bonilla said as she clutched her youngest daughter.

Feyenoord suffers first league loss; PSV thrashes Sparta
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Michael Buskermolen and Dennis den
Turk scored goals and AZ Alkmaar, coached by former Feyenoord boss
Willem van Hanegem, handed the Rotterdam club its first league loss
of the season Saturday, 2-1.
	   The defeat left Feyenoord level on points at the top of the
league with FC Twente, which won 3-0 Friday at Fortuna Sittard. The
Rotterdam club has one match in hand to Twente and a superior goal
difference.
	   The victory took AZ, which was promoted from the Dutch first
division at the end of last season, to sixth place. It was also
revenge for Van Hanegem, who was fired by Feyenoord in 1996.
	   Buskermolen opened the scoring for Alkmaar in the 43rd minute
before Den Turk doubled the lead on the hour. Feyenoord captain
Jean Paul van Gastel pulled back a goal in the 75th minute, setting
up an exciting last 15 minutes, but Feyenoord could not find the
equalizer.
	   In Eindhoven, PSV thrashed Sparta Rotterdam 4-0 on the strength
of three first-half goals by Ruud van Nistelrooij. Belgian
international Luc Nilis also scored before the break to give Bobby
Robson's side its fourth victory of the season and lift it to ninth
place.
	   In other matches, Willem II Tilburg drew 1-1 at MVV Maastricht,
while SC Heerenveen beat Vitesse Arnhem 2-1, and Cambuur Leeuwarden
downed NAC Breda 3-1.
	   Ajax Amsterdam takes on NEC Nijmegen Sunday knowing that a
victory would put it level on points with arch-rival Feyenoord.

	   ROME (AP) _ After 11 winless draws, Italy's biggest lotto
jackpot ever found a winner Saturday -- or perhaps as many as 100
winners -- who bought into a ticket worth nearly dlrs 40 million.
	   Super Enalotto fever had been rising as the take mounted in the
twice-weekly numbers-guessing game, which drew hopefuls from France
and Switzerland to buy tickets at the last-minute Saturday just
inside the Italian border.
	   Finally, someone picked the winning series of numbers, which
this time were 1, 21, 30, 61, 73 and 84.
	   Winners of big Italian lottery and other games don't usually
come forward to identify themselves, and usually all that is know
is where the winning ticket was purchased.
	   But in this case, the newsstand dealer in the resort town of
Peschici, on the ``spur'' of the boot-shaped peninsula, said 100
``shares'' of the winning ticket were sold.
	   That means someone who only bought one share would earn one
one-hundredth of the total take, or about dlrs 400,000 per share.
	   The Italian news agency ANSA reported that scores of people in
the town of 5,000 inhabitants danced with joy outside the
newsstand, but it was not known how many people had bought into the
series of numbers, designed by the newsstand dealer.
	   The second prize, for correctly guessing five of the six
numbers, plus one wild-card number, was worth about dlrs 6.2
million.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ As Brazil's government gets ready
to push unpopular austerity measures through Congress, doubts were
raised about how soon it could do so.
	   Visiting Italian political scientist Giovanni Sartori told the O
Globo newspaper Saturday that the country's political system was
``horrible.'' ``It seems like a soap opera because of its expanse
and the chapters that divide it,'' he said.
	   His comments highlight fears in Brazil that the austerity
measures, put forward to try and heal its battered economy, will
progress at a snail's pace through Congress.
	   The measures, announced Wednesday, are a range of spending cuts
and higher taxes aimed at saving dlrs 24 billion in 1999 to attack
Brazil's budget deficit - and help it win a dlrs 30 billion
International Monetary Fund aid package.
	   As well as a tax increase in bank charges, there are two
particularly unpopular proposals: to raise a social security tax on
civil servants and introduce one for retired government workers.
	   So, even though the government has a majority in the 513-seat
Chamber of Deputies and the 81-seat Senate, it faces a battle to
get its measures approved.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ All 36 officers based at a
Brazilian police station are to be jailed because of calls made to
telephone sex lines, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Each will spend 15 days detained at their own station, but at
different times so as not to bring policing in a northern district
of this city to a halt, said the daily Extra. They will also have
to pay the bill.
	   International calls were made to the lines, said the daily, but
the size of the bill was not clear.
	   The punishment follows an internal inquiry, reported the
newspaper. Some officers claimed innocence, saying the telephone
line could be accessed and used by residents nearby.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A private airplane crashed as it
prepared to land in a southern Brazilian state, killing at least
three people, said firefighters Saturday.
	   Fishermen saw the aircraft explode when it hit the ground late
Friday night on an uninhabited island near the mainland, said
firefighter Samuel Santos.
	   Moments before, the plane had been circling as it got ready to
land at the town of Joinville, 46O miles (750 kms) south-west of
Rio, where it had come from, said Santos.
	   The plane was completely destroyed in the crash, killing the
pilot and two passengers on board, said Santos. A third passenger
may have been with them and died.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Prosecutors have frozen 30 Mexican bank
accounts they claim are linked to Raul Salinas, brother of former
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, local media reported.
	   The Attorney General's Office was unable to confirm that report
Saturday.
	   The Mexican accounts were frozen over the last two months in
relation to charges of illicit enrichment on which Raul Salinas is
currently standing trial, the newspaper Reforma reported.
	   No total amount was given for the accounts _ some of which were
listed under other names, including relatives of Raul Salinas _ but
the report said prosecutors had uncovered one which contained dlrs
16 million.
	   Those accounts are among the 204 Mexican bank accounts _ and 85
foreign accounts _ prosecutors say they have uncovered, some opened
under aliases and some of which may contain laundered money.
	   ___
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Relatives of a Salvadoran man
charged in last year's Havana hotel bombings traveled to Cuba over
the weekend to investigate the status of his case, the man's
brother said Saturday.
	   William Leon, brother of Ernesto Cruz Leon, said that their
mother had visited Ernesto in jail and found him to be in good
health, but poor spirits.
	   No exact trial date has been set, but it is expected to begin in
the coming months, the brother said.
	   Ernesto Cruz Leon, 26, was arrested Sept. 4, 1997, in last
summer's bombings. He is accused of a bombing at the Hotel
Copacabana that killed an Italian man, as well as blasts at two
other hotels that wounded three people.
	   The Cuban government said Thursday that there was enough
evidence to try Cruz Leon, along with fellow Salvadoran Otto Rene
Rodriguez Llerena and three Guatemalans for similar acts on the
communist island.
	   Rodriguez Llerena and the Guatemalans were arrested in Cuba in
June.
	   Cuba's Communist Party daily on Thursday accused all five of
belonging to a Central America-based network directed and funded by
the Cuban American National Foundation based in Miami.
	   The foundation denied the charge and has always denied using
violence of any kind in its campaigns against the government of
President Fidel Castro.
	   ___
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ Six U.S. and Canadian petroleum
executives and a pilot on a hunting trip died Saturday when their
helicopter crashed in the tropical lowlands of Bolivia, company
officials said.
	   The accident took place 60 kilometers (35 miles) east of Santa
Cruz. The six were going to a hunting cabin located 20 kilometers
(12 miles) away from the crash site.
	   The cause of the crash has not been established. The helicopter
was owned by a rental company, Helibol.
	   The victims included Canadians Steve Gruber, General Manager of
Western Atlas; Woody Clark, General Manager of Veritas D.G.C. Land;
Robert Boyd, General Manager of Destiny; John Smatla, a consultant
for Pluspetrol.
	   Chris Wright, Planning Manager for Chaco S.A., was from the
United States. The pilot was identified as John Freeouf.

United Nations, world leaders prepare for new showdown with Iraq

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ World leaders and U.N. officials faced a
new crisis with Iraq Sunday after the government announced that it
would no longer allow U.N. weapons inspectors to work in the
country.
	   The U.N. Security Council late Saturday unanimously condemned
Iraq's decision and demanded that Baghdad rescind the decision
immediately and unconditionally.
	   The council called Saturday's announcement from Baghdad ``a
flagrant violation'' of council resolutions and a memorandum of
understanding between Iraq and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
that averted military action against Iraq in February after another
crisis over weapons inspections.
	   It reiterated the council's offer to review Iraq's compliance
with U.N. resolutions if it resumes cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   The decision by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his top
advisers exempted only a handful of experts from the International
Atomic Energy Agency, who monitor suspected nuclear sites.
	   The move Saturday was seen as a response to the council's
decision Friday to review Iraq's progress on eliminating prohibited
weapons.
	   Although it pledged a ``comprehensive review,'' the council did
not accede to Iraq's demand that the review lead directly to the
removal of the sweeping trade sanctions imposed in 1990 after
Baghdad's forces invaded Kuwait.
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until the Special Commission
certifies that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
Iraq insists it has done so, but the commission says Baghdad
continues to hide information on weapons, especially those with
biological and chemical agents.
	   Iraq's statement issued Saturday said the ban would continue
``until the United Nations looks at the issue in an honest and
positive way, leading to Iraq's right to the lifting of the unjust
sanctions.''
	   Iraq also insisted that the Security Council fire Richard
Butler, chief of the U.N. Special Commission that oversees weapons
inspections. Iraq has long accused Butler of working on behalf of
the United States to prolong sanctions.
	   It remained unclear if Saturday's decision would provoke the
United States and Britain to threaten military action against
Baghdad, as they did earlier this year after the Iraqi regime
prevented U.N. inspectors from entering Saddam's presidential
palaces. Both U.S. and British officials condemned the move, but
said little else Saturday.
	   Saddam Hussein's decision caused jitters in Baghdad. Currency
traders said the already depressed Iraqi dinar fell from 1660 to
the dollar to 1760 from within minutes of the announcement.
	   Officials at the U.N. Special Commission in Baghdad declined to
take calls and issued no statements Saturday.
	   Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told reporters
Saturday that the country would stand firm.
	   ``This is the decision of the people of Iraq and the leadership
of Iraq to save the sovereignty of Iraq and the right of the people
to live,'' Saleh said.
	   The sanctions have severely damaged the Iraqi economy by
limiting the sale of oil, banning air travel and prohibiting most
other financial dealings with Iraq.
	   Saturday's decision deepens a dispute that began Aug. 5, when
Iraq announced that teams from the Special Commission and the
atomic agency could no longer carry out spot inspections. But Iraq
allowed both groups to continue long-term monitoring, often done
with cameras and sensors, at previously identified weapons sites.
	   The Iraqi Information Ministry issued a statement late Saturday
saying the government was not asking the roughly 120 U.N. monitors
and support staff to leave Iraq. It added that the monitoring
cameras and sensors installed at weapons sites could continue to
operate.
	   ``Iraq was disappointed because lifting of the sanctions didn't
go in a normal fashion,'' the statement said. It added that the
Security Council decision Friday had been made under ``clear
pressure from America.''

	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ An opposition coalition stood a good
chance of ousting Macedonia's ex-communist government in a second
round of parliamentary elections in the young Balkan country on
Sunday.
	   More than half the legislature's 120 seats were up for grabs
after the Oct. 18 first round which left the nationalist-reformist
coalition of VMRO-DPMNE and Democratic Alternative with the
advantage.
	   If the opposition forces fail to gain an outright majority in
parliament, the country's ethnic Albanian minority may determine
whether the ruling Social Democrats remain in power, depending on
which party it chooses to ally with.
	   The Social Democrats won just 13 of the 55 seats allocated in
the first round, trailing both the opposition coalition with 21 and
the ethnic Albanians' party with 18. Three seats went to two minor
parties, with 65 left undetermined due to a turnout below the
required one-third of registered voters or, in other areas, no
clear majority.
	   Macedonia gained independence six years ago when the former
Yugoslavia broke up, and is the only ex-Yugoslav republic spared
from war. But tensions are high due to its shared border with
Serbia's Kosovo province, where hundreds have died this year in
fighting between Serbian government troops and Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian separatist guerrillas.
	   Macedonia has its own large and restive community of ethnic
Albanians _ 23 percent of the country's 2 million people. There are
fears they could take up arms to win independence for the western
part of Macedonia, where many of them live and outnumber
Macedonians.
	   Top issues during the campaign were Macedonia's feeble economy
and disputes with neighbors Bulgaria, Albania and Greece.
	   The outcome is important for international peace efforts for
Kosovo. Macedonian territory is needed as a base for NATO's aerial
missions over the province, involving spy planes.

National Security Council. ``We view this as a serious matter,''
Leavy said.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ Iraq announced Saturday it would cut off all
dealings with U.N. weapons inspectors, including barring them from
monitoring sites _ a move quickly and unanimously condemned by the
U.N. Security Council. The council, meeting in New York, demanded
Baghad immediately and unconditionally rescind the decision by
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his top advisers. The Iraqi
action exempted only a handful of International Atomic Energy
Agency experts who monitor suspected nuclear sites. The council
called Saturday's announcement from Baghdad ``a flagrant
violation'' of council resolutions and of an understanding between
Iraq and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The written
understanding averted military action against Iraq in February over
another inspections crisis. (IRAQ-UN)
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ At least 231 people have been
confirmed dead in Honduras from former hurricane Mitch, bringing
the storm's death toll in the region to 392, the National Emergency
Commission said Saturday. Authorities in neighboring Nicaragua
reported 121 dead from heavy rains and flash flooding there.
Another 151 people are listed as missing, the National Civil
Defense System reported. Mitch _ once one of the strongest
hurricanes to hit the Caribbean _ was downgraded to a tropical
depression, but continued to dump heavy rain on the region. At
least 131 people were reported killed in Tegucigalpa after
floodwaters rose to the third floor of some buildings in the
Honduran capital Saturday. Army helicopters rescued some flood
victims clinging to rooftops. ``This is a national catastrophe
without any comparison,'' said Gen. Mario Hung Pacheco, head of
Honduras' armed forces. (TROPICAL WEATHER-MITCH)
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Forensic experts on Saturday identified
more of the 60 youngsters _ some of them not yet teen-agers _ who
died in a dance hall fire, but the question of how the catastrophe
could happen remains unanswered. Investigators still don't know
what caused the flames that raced through the overcrowded hall,
blocked one of the exits and forced panicked teen-agers to flee
down the one remaining staircase and leap out of second-story
windows. As investigators worked to find the cause, examiners
identified another 22 of the bodies, bringing the total to 40, and
officials said 49 people were released from hospital. (SWEDEN-FIRE)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's rival
politicians missed the first important deadline of their peace
agreement Saturday, a day marked by the killing of a Catholic man
as he walked home alone. Van driver Brian Service, 35, was shot
twice in the back of the head and three times in the back. Local
Catholic residents and politicians blamed pro-British extremists
from nearby Protestant turf. Later, an anonymous caller to a
Belfast news organization claimed responsibility for the killing on
behalf of the Red Hand Commando, a small gang that along with other
outlawed pro-British groups has observed a cease-fire since 1994.
But the caller used no established codeword to authenticate the
claim. A politician linked to the group, Billy Smyth, said there
was ``absolutely no way the Red Hand Commando sanctioned that
shooting. It wouldn't fit in with their commitment to a peace
strategy.'' (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
Cabinet may not vote on the latest Mideast peace deal in time to
meet its Monday starting date. The Cabinet was to convene Sunday
but the premier said he would not show his ministers the agreement
until the Palestinians submitted a security document on fighting
terrorism. And without his Cabinet's approval, the premier has said
that he will not begin implementing the accord, which calls for
Israel to cede 13.1 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian
control. Still reeling from a suicide-bomb attack in which 40
Israeli children narrowly escaped death, Netanyahu said the
Palestinian Authority must arrest Mohammed Deif, a military leader
of the Islamic militant group Hamas. Hamas opposes peace with
Israel and has claimed responsibility for killing scores of
Israelis in deadly attacks since peace-making began in 1993.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Cabinet approved the peace
accord Friday and said it would present its plan on fighting
terrorism to the Americans by Monday as promised.

Rubin, Snyder set up all-American final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   QUEBEC (AP) _ Tara Snyder had to rally from a first-set drubbing
to beat fellow American Jane Chi Saturday and set up an all-United
States final with Chandra Rubin at the Bell Challenge Open.
	   Chi, ranked 128th of the WTA Tour, dominated her seventh-seeded
compatriot to start the match, but Snyder came back for a 1-6, 6-3,
7-5 victory.
	   Rubin won her semifinal match against Nathalie Dechy of France
6-2, 6-4.
	   Chi's style frustrated Snyder, who received a code violation for
ball abuse after she was broken in the seventh game of the second
set. But she used the outburst to her advantage, winning the next
two games to take the set.
	   ``She came out really strong and was aggressive in the first,
but I really wasn't moving at all, '' Snyder said.. ``I had to be
more aggressive and in the third set I had to come into the net
more and force play.''
	   Play tightened up in the third set with both players holding
serve until Chi cracked in the ninth game to fall behind 5-4.
Snyder, after consecutive unforced errors, then dropped serve to
even the score at five.
	   Snyder fought back and broke Chi after an errant cross-court
backhand. She converted her first match point in the 12th game to
advance to her first tour final.
	   ``She's really intense and a fighter, '' Chi said.
	   In the other semifinal match, fifth-seeded Rubin broke Dechy
(No.8) in the third and fifth games of the first set to take a 4-1
lead. Then in the seventh game, Rubin again broke her opponent
after six deuces, and went on to win the set.
	   ``After I got that break, I could feel that there was a bit of a
momentum shift, '' said Rubin who is now ranked 38th in the world.
``You don't want to let a player who is solid like that get back
into the match. That's what it's all about, staying tough when you
have to.''

Pruett wins pole for Marlboro 500
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FONTANA, California (AP) _ Scott Pruett's pole-winning lap
Saturday in qualifying for the Marlboro 500 at California Speedway
was just about what everybody expected.
	   Pruett, driving in his last race for Patrick Racing, turned a
lap of 31.249 seconds on the 3.265-kilometer (2.209-mile)
California Speedway circuit _ plenty fast enough to earn the fifth
pole of his CART FedEx Series career but well below the dazzling
30.316 by Brazilian Mauricio Gugelmin last year.
	   ``The Handford Device is doing what it was intended to do,''
said Pruett, referring to an aerodynamic piece being used on the
rear wing of the Champ Cars to slow them down on CART's biggest
speedways _ the California track and its sister oval at Michigan
Speedway.
	   The only previous race in which the device was used was the U.S.
500 at Michigan in July. Greg Moore came out the winner that day in
an 800 kilometer (500-mile) event that featured a CART record 62
lead changes and some of the closest, most spectacular racing ever
seen in the open-wheel sport.
	   Jimmy Vasser, locked in a battle with Scotsman Dario Franchitti
for second place in the CART standings heading into the
season-finale on Sunday, was second to Pruett on Saturday at
31.301.
	   ``There are going to be a lot of similarities to the Michigan
race, but it won't be as exaggerated because this track has less
banking and isn't quite as wide,'' Vasser said. ``Still, I think
there's going to be quite a bit of drafting and there's going to be
a lot of passing.''
	   Considering that the top 24 qualifiers on Saturday were within
one second of each other, there is also likely to be a lot of very
close racing on Sunday.
	   The race at Michigan was generally pretty clean, with eight
caution flags but no multiple-car accidents.
	   Michael Andretti, who was third in qualifying at 31.372, says it
was a combination of good driving and luck that kept the U.S. 500
from being a disaster.
	   ``Michigan could have been terrible, but the driving was the
best I've ever seen,'' Andretti said. ``Everybody took care of each
other.
	   ``We're going to be racing in big packs here, like we were at
Michigan, and we have to take care of each other because if one of
us makes a little mistake, we can hurt ourselves or somebody else
real bad.''
	   Sunday's race will be the CART finale for Vasser's teammate,
two-time reigning PPG Cup champion Alex Zanardi of Italy, who will
move to Formula One in 1999.
	   Zanardi, who has seven victories this season, would love to end
his three years in CART with another victory. But he will start a
disappointing 18th in the 28-car field after qualifying at 31.824.
	   ``Heck, Jimmy was a lap down in Michigan and almost won the
race,'' Zanardi said. ``We'll make the car right for tomorrow and
that is what is important.''
	   Another goodbye on Sunday will be to three-time series champion
Bobby Rahal, who will retire as a driver after 17 years in the
open-wheel sport.
	   Rahal qualified a solid fifth at 31.394.
	   ``I think we have a good race car,'' said Rahal, whose most
recent of 24 victories came in 1991. ``I think we should be able to
run with the leaders most of the way. It's tough. You can never
really tell going into a race like this where you stand, but I've
got to say I feel pretty good about things.
	   ``I'm excited about the race and nothing has hit me
(emotionally), yet. I'm thinking how to win it.''
	   Franchitti, who goes into the 250-lap race holding a 12-point
lead over Vasser in the battle for the runner-up spot and the dlrs
500,000 that goes with it, will start eighth.
	   The winner of Sunday's race also will collect dlrs 1 million.

A devastated village reveals the depths of Kosovo's misery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo PRI101 &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OPTERUSHA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three faces along a rocky village
road Saturday showed the misery of Kosovo's enduring conflict: A
girl who dreams of her missing parents. The weeping man in his
house of rubble. An elder nonchalantly revealing scars of torture.
	   All were ethnic Albanians returning for the first time in months
to Opterusha, a small settlement nestled amid mountains set
glittering by bright sunshine on golden autumn leaves.
	   They found systematic devastation, with house after house gutted
and burned, some with gaping holes in what remained of the walls.
	   Only a few dwellings were unscathed _ those of Serbs who lived
peacefully with their Albanian neighbors before a Serb crackdown
last February that escalated into all-out warfare.
	   Villagers fled when the Serb forces started shelling in July.
Assessing the damage Saturday touched the raw emotional wounds of
living with war's fear and uncertainty.
	   Milaim Kabashi's brown eyes watered and his lip quivered as he
led journalists to the house he shared with his brother.
	   ``I didn't expect this,'' he said, his voice quavering. ``I
don't know what I'll do. I lost everything.''
	   The two-story building was little more than brown brick walls on
three sides strewn with rubble. A rusted, fire-gnarled bed frame
lay amid charred beams and garbage. Five bunches of drying red
peppers, some withered and brown, hung from what little remained of
the front.
	   Kabashi, 55, climbed on the heaps of smashed brick and mortar,
tears still falling. He gestured toward one corner, explaining that
was where his brother's children slept.
	   ``We didn't have money to build two houses,'' he explained. Now
his 40 bags of wheat are burned, and he doesn't know if the relief
agencies that brought food when he was a refugee in the village of
Lashka Drenovc come to Opterusha, about 35 miles (55 kilometers)
southwest of Pristina.
	   ``I don't have a truck to bring anything here,'' he said,
shaking his head.
	   An old man in a black coat ambled by, clutching a bag of grapes
in his right hand. He had been captured by police and held for
weeks, and was only recently released.
	   His forehead wrinkled as he stared ahead while answering
questions. A small crowd of neighbors, most of them teen-age boys,
gathered around to listen.
	   ``The police put a stone in my mouth, then started to hit me in
the face,'' began Ali Kabashi, 70. ``The stone was so I couldn't
shout when they burned my leg with wood.''
	   He raised his right pants leg to show red marks on the calf,
then unbuckled his belt to drop his pants and show more wounds on
his thigh.
	   ``They poured petrol on me and threatened to set me on fire,''
he said. ``I tried to escape so they would kill me immediately. One
hit me and I lost consciousness.''
	   The police wanted to know about ethnic Albanian guerrillas,
Kabashi said. As they tortured him, he said, they kept repeating
that he knew who the guerrillas were, and that his son was one.
	   A little further on, 18-year-old Hado Mazreku hugged her jacket
and grimaced to hold back tears while speaking about her missing
parents.
	   No one has seen them or knows what happened since she fled the
family house when the Serbs invaded. When she went back there
Saturday, they were gone.
	   A recurring dream of recent weeks warns her of their deaths.
	   ``I see them dressed in white,'' she sobbed into her right hand.
	   A thin girl with red-brown hair and freckles, Mazreku shook her
head when asked if she would live alone in the house.
	   ``I don't know. I'll go somewhere with people,'' she said,
staring off. ``I won't stay here.''

Anger and bloodshed even before start of accord's implementation
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In Israel and the Palestinian lands, a prelude
to peace can look a lot like an outbreak of war.
	   A few snapshots from the days since the Oct. 23 signing of the
Wye River accord: Schoolchildren sobbing after a brush with death
at the hands of a suicide bomber. Forensics experts picking through
the charred and mangled remnants of an Israeli army jeep. A slain
Jewish settler's bloody corpse dumped in a West Bank street. Angry
protesters reviling the prime minister as a traitor.
	   It has been a tumultuous run-up to implementation of the
agreement, which is set to begin Monday. But so far both sides say
they are undeterred by the violence.
	   Even so, the past week's events were a drawing of battle lines,
throwing into sharp relief the obstacles that will be faced by the
agreement's architects in coming weeks and months.
	   Extremists on both sides quickly made felt the ferocity of their
opposition to the pact, which calls for security steps by the
Palestinians in exchange for an Israeli pullback from another 13
percent of the West Bank.
	   Hard-line Jewish settlers staged disruptive sit-down
demonstrations on West Bank highways, and a few voiced
anti-government threats deemed credible enough that security
surrounding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was increased
considerably.
	   On the Palestinian side, the radical Islamic group Hamas
returned after a 14-month hiatus to what had long been its
hallmark: the suicide bomb.
	   A militant tried to ram an explosives-rigged car into a
schoolbus carrying Jewish settler children in the Gaza Strip, but
an Israeli army jeep managed to cut off the attacker and take the
blast's brunt instead, killing a teen-aged soldier.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat responded with his most
resolute actions yet against Hamas. In addition to rounding up
hundreds of Hamas activists, he dared to move directly against the
group's revered spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, putting him
under house arrest hours after the foiled suicide bombing.
	   But it was difficult to tell how long _ and how tough _ the
crackdown would be. Two senior militants detained earlier, Ismail
Hanieh of Hamas and Hafez Azam of Islamic Jihad, were already free
as of Saturday.
	   Arafat, always closely attuned to street sentiment, is well
aware that moving too harshly against Yassin could backfire by
inflaming the ailing, wheelchair-bound Islamic preacher's edgily
devout followers.
	   ``They've gone overboard _ to disrespect the sheik this way is
way past the line!'' said Osama Afif, a hot-eyed 20-year-old who
lives in Yassin's slum neighborhood in Gaza City. ``If they're
smart, they won't keep him under house arrest for long.''
	   On the Israeli side, Netanyahu has dealt with the anger of
hard-line settlers by alternately making emotional reassurances _
``We love you!'' he told them on his return from Washington _ and
being bluntly dismissive of their attempts to topple him.
	   The 150,000 Jewish settlers are far from a monolithic political
bloc.
	   Only a relatively small number are ideologues who fervently
believe in a biblical claim to all the West Bank. Many settlers
instead have a purely pragmatic goal: a comfortable suburban
lifestyle at far less expense than inside Israel proper.
	   Of necessity, Netanyahu reacts vehemently and publicly to any
attack on settlers _ including the slaying of a Hebron-area settler
on Monday, three days after the signing of the peace agreement. But
ordinary Israelis tend to take a somewhat more nuanced view.
	   While Thursday's attack aimed at schoolchildren was universally
denounced as despicable, many in the Israeli mainstream quietly
question the logic of maintaining isolated Jewish settlements in
the heart of Palestinian-run Gaza.
	   A commentary headlined ``An attack foretold'' in Friday's
editions of the Haaretz newspaper pointed to a perception of such
settlers as ``people who endanger the lives of their children and
the soldiers who protect them.''
	   The coming weeks will provide plenty of fodder for charges and
counter-charges of insincerity and inactivity. For example, Israel
is demanding the dismantling of Hamas' military wing, Izzedine al
Qassam.
	   But it's not the kind of organization that can easily be broken
by the arrest of one or two top leaders. It is shadowy and
secretive, made up of cells of operatives who are usually unaware
of one another's activities and may well get money and marching
orders from Hamas leaders outside the Palestinian lands.
	   Palestinians might also balk at cutting their police force _ as
called for in the accord _ at a time when Israel is demanding that
they carry out nothing less than an all-out war on militant groups.
	   Also, although neither side is saying much about it, there is
danger that radicals' anger could be turned against the United
States because of the Clinton administration's brokering of the
accord and the CIA's role in overseeing its implementation.
	   ``What (Palestinian) crackdown? You mean the CIA crackdown,''
said Omar Abu Al-Subar, 42, an angry Yassin supporter in Gaza.
``From infidels like the Americans ... it is expected.''

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ As Brazil's government gets ready
to push unpopular austerity measures through Congress, doubts were
raised about how soon it could do so.
	   Visiting Italian political scientist Giovanni Sartori told the O
Globo newspaper Saturday that the country's political system was
``horrible.'' ``It seems like a soap opera because of its expanse
and the chapters that divide it,'' he said.
	   His comments highlight fears in Brazil that the austerity
measures, put forward to try and heal its battered economy, will
progress at a snail's pace through Congress.
	   The measures, announced Wednesday, are a range of spending cuts
and higher taxes aimed at saving dlrs 24 billion in 1999 to attack
Brazil's budget deficit - and help it win a dlrs 30 billion
International Monetary Fund aid package.
	   As well as a tax increase in bank charges, there are two
particularly unpopular proposals: to raise a social security tax on
civil servants and introduce one for retired government workers.
	   So, even though the government has a majority in the 513-seat
Chamber of Deputies and the 81-seat Senate, it faces a battle to
get its measures approved.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ All 36 officers based at a
Brazilian police station are to be jailed because of calls made to
telephone sex lines, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Each will spend 15 days detained at their own station, but at
different times so as not to bring policing in a northern district
of this city to a halt, said the daily Extra. They will also have
to pay the bill.
	   International calls were made to the lines, said the daily, but
the size of the bill was not clear.
	   The punishment follows an internal inquiry, reported the
newspaper. Some officers claimed innocence, saying the telephone
line could be accessed and used by residents nearby.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A private airplane crashed as it
prepared to land in a southern Brazilian state, killing at least
three people, said firefighters Saturday.
	   Fishermen saw the aircraft explode when it hit the ground late
Friday night on an uninhabited island near the mainland, said
firefighter Samuel Santos.
	   Moments before, the plane had been circling as it got ready to
land at the town of Joinville, 46O miles (750 kms) south-west of
Rio, where it had come from, said Santos.
	   The plane was completely destroyed in the crash, killing the
pilot and two passengers on board, said Santos. A third passenger
may have been with them and died.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Prosecutors have frozen 30 Mexican bank
accounts they claim are linked to Raul Salinas, brother of former
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, local media reported.
	   The Attorney General's Office was unable to confirm that report
Saturday.
	   The Mexican accounts were frozen over the last two months in
relation to charges of illicit enrichment on which Raul Salinas is
currently standing trial, the newspaper Reforma reported.
	   No total amount was given for the accounts _ some of which were
listed under other names, including relatives of Raul Salinas _ but
the report said prosecutors had uncovered one which contained dlrs
16 million.
	   Those accounts are among the 204 Mexican bank accounts _ and 85
foreign accounts _ prosecutors say they have uncovered, some opened
under aliases and some of which may contain laundered money.

	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Relatives of a Salvadoran man
charged in last year's Havana hotel bombings traveled to Cuba over
the weekend to investigate the status of his case, the man's
brother said Saturday.
	   William Leon, brother of Ernesto Cruz Leon, said that their
mother had visited Ernesto in jail and found him to be in good
health, but poor spirits.
	   No exact trial date has been set, but it is expected to begin in
the coming months, the brother said.
	   Ernesto Cruz Leon, 26, was arrested Sept. 4, 1997, in last
summer's bombings. He is accused of a bombing at the Hotel
Copacabana that killed an Italian man, as well as blasts at two
other hotels that wounded three people.
	   The Cuban government said Thursday that there was enough
evidence to try Cruz Leon, along with fellow Salvadoran Otto Rene
Rodriguez Llerena and three Guatemalans for similar acts on the
communist island.
	   Rodriguez Llerena and the Guatemalans were arrested in Cuba in
June.
	   Cuba's Communist Party daily on Thursday accused all five of
belonging to a Central America-based network directed and funded by
the Cuban American National Foundation based in Miami.
	   The foundation denied the charge and has always denied using
violence of any kind in its campaigns against the government of
President Fidel Castro.

	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ A helicopter carrying five petroleum
executives to a hunting cabin crashed Saturday in the tropical
lowlands of Santa Cruz, company officials said. All five, four
Americans and a Canadian, were killed, along with their American
pilot.
	   The Alouette 3 helicopter crashed 40 miles east of Santa Cruz,
less than 15 miles from the cabin. The caused of the accident
wasn't known, officials at Chaco S.A., which is owned by
Chicago-based Amoco, the fifth-largest U.S. oil company.
	   The helicopter, owned by the chopper rental company Helibol,
crashed into a soybean field and did not catch fire, according to
Darvo Flores, a local journalist who had visited the scene.
	   Chaco identified the victims as: Americans Steve Gruber, General
Manager of Western Atlas; Woody Clark, General Manager of Veritas
D.G.C. Land; John Smatla, a consultant for Pluspetrol; Chris
Wright, Planning Manager for Chaco S.A.; and Canadian Robert Boyd,
General Manager of Destiny. John Freeouf, the American pilot, was
employed by Helibol.
	   Wright was from Florida, but home states or towns were not
available for the other victims.

	   VALLADOLID, Spain (AP) _ The latest social drama by British
director Ken Loach won the Golden Ear of Corn award Saturday at the
Valladolid Film Festival.
	   ``My Name is Joe'' focuses on the love affair between a
recovering alcoholic and a social worker in a rundown Glasgow
neighborhood.
	   The decision by the jury of the 43rd edition of the film
festival in the northern Spanish city of Valladolid won applause
from the audience.
	   Briton Peter Mullan, who plays Joe in Loach's film, received the
award for best actor, while Spain's Adriadna Gil was voted best
actress for her role in the Spanish film, ``Black Tears.''
	   The jury's special prize was given to Heather Rose. Rose, a
sufferer of cerebral palsy, wrote and acted in a film based on her
life titled ``Dance Me to My Song,'' directed by Australian Rolf de
Heer.
	   The award for best new director was jointly awarded to British
director Shane Meadows, for ``24.7,'' and Frenchman Christophe
Ruggia for ``Chaaba's Son.''
	   Meadows' film also won the best photography prize.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Some Hollywood insiders questioned the wisdom of
Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise spending a year-and-a-half in the
prime of their movie careers making ``Eyes Wide Shut'' with
eccentric filmmaker Stanley Kubrick.
	   ``People looked at us like we were crazy to go there,'' Kidman
says in Movieline magazine. ``But we weren't giving up anything, we
were working with Kubrick. Yeah, I could have done three other
movies and made lots of money _ who cares?''
	   Despite the time involved and the secrecy surrounding Kubrick's
latest work, due for release next summer, Kidman said working for
the legendary filmmaker was uplifting.
	   ``It was an honor,'' she said. ``I would do it again in a
second.''
	   Kidman, with credits including ``Dead Calm,'' ``Billy Bathgate''
and ``To Die For,'' is currently co-starring in the box office hit
``Practical Magic'' with Sandra Bullock.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Actor Jean-Claude Van Damme is finding it
hard to keep his cool in the courtroom.
	   The action star lost control on the witness stand Friday,
screaming out his denial to accusations that he owes film profits
to martial arts expert Frank Dux. Dux is suing the 38-year-old
actor for dlrs 1.5 million.
	   ``I swear before God and under oath I never once in my life
tried to take credit away from a man!'' Van Damme yelled.
	   His attorney, Martin Singer, and Superior Court Judge James
Kaddo unsuccessfully tried to quiet him down. The judge eventually
called a recess to restore order.
	   Dux claims in the lawsuit that he co-wrote a screenplay that
became ``The Quest'' and that Van Damme promised to share profits.
His name appears next to Van Damme in screen credits as ``story
by'' but not as the writer.
	   Van Damme said he was frustrated because his attempts to help a
friend break into the movie business have backfired.
	   It was Van Damme's second outburst in three days. On Wednesday,
the actor yelled at Dux when he testified Van Damme told him to
stop dating his sister-in-law because the movie star wanted to
pursue her himself.

	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Snow leopards, which had been hunted to
near-extinction in Armenia, have begun to reappear in increasing
numbers, a government official said.
	   From a low of just two leopards in a government preserve a few
years ago, there are now an estimated 30 throughout the country,
Ministry of Ecology spokesman Artzun Pepanyan said Saturday.
	   Snow leopards, indigenous to Central Asia and once highly prized
for their pelts, are considered endangered internationally. Their
worldwide population was estimated at 4,500 to 7,400 in 1996,
according to the World Wildlife Fund.
	   Pepanyan said he did not know why the animals are returning to
Armenia, but said other formerly rare animals _ including bears,
wild boars, wolves and Armenian mouflons, a kind of wild sheep _
have also been thriving.
	   In fact, he said, the animals have begun to cause problems to
livestock farmers in some parts of the former Soviet republic,
particularly in the vicinity of the town of Dzermuk.
	    &UR; ___
	   NELSPRUIT, South Africa (AP) _ Conservation officials have
proposed killing some elephants in one of Africa's largest parks,
saying that elephant overpopulation threatens other species.
	   The practice of ``culling'' elephants in Kruger National Park
was suspended in 1996 pending a review of the controversial policy.
	   After conducting the review, park officials now recommend that
the Israel-sized park be divided into six zones. In some, elephants
would be allowed to multiply, but in others, their populations
would provisionally be reduced by 7 percent per year.
	   Elephants in those zones would be moved elsewhere or killed by
marksmen aboard helicopters, according to the recommendations.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ World leaders and U.N. officials faced a
new crisis with Iraq Sunday after the government announced that it
would no longer allow U.N. weapons inspectors to work in the
country.
	   The U.N. Security Council late Saturday unanimously condemned
Iraq's decision and demanded that Baghdad rescind the decision
immediately and unconditionally.
	   The council called Saturday's announcement from Baghdad ``a
flagrant violation'' of council resolutions and a memorandum of
understanding between Iraq and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
that averted military action against Iraq in February after another
crisis over weapons inspections.
	   It reiterated the council's offer to review Iraq's compliance
with U.N. resolutions if it resumes cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   The decision by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his top
advisers exempted only a handful of experts from the International
Atomic Energy Agency, who monitor suspected nuclear sites.
	   The move Saturday was seen as a response to the council's
decision Friday to review Iraq's progress on eliminating prohibited
weapons.
	   Although it pledged a ``comprehensive review,'' the council did
not accede to Iraq's demand that the review lead directly to the
removal of the sweeping trade sanctions imposed in 1990 after
Baghdad's forces invaded Kuwait.
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until the Special Commission
certifies that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
Iraq insists it has done so, but the commission says Baghdad
continues to hide information on weapons, especially those with
biological and chemical agents.
	   Iraq's statement issued Saturday said the ban would continue
``until the United Nations looks at the issue in an honest and
positive way, leading to Iraq's right to the lifting of the unjust
sanctions.''
	   Iraq also insisted that the Security Council fire Richard
Butler, chief of the U.N. Special Commission that oversees weapons
inspections. Iraq has long accused Butler of working on behalf of
the United States to prolong sanctions.
	   It remained unclear if Saturday's decision would provoke the
United States and Britain to threaten military action against
Baghdad, as they did earlier this year after the Iraqi regime
prevented U.N. inspectors from entering Saddam's presidential
palaces. Both U.S. and British officials condemned the move.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton's national security
advisers were reviewing the situation and consulting with allies
and U.N. officials, said David Leavy, a spokesman for the U.S.
National Security Council. ``We view this as a serious matter,''
Leavy said.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen canceled a weeklong Asian
tour to return to Washington and participate in U.S. administration
discussions over the new standoff with Iraq.

Tee Martin is nearly perfect for Tennessee
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: WILL be UPDATED with later games. &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLUMBIA, South Carolina (AP) _ Tee Martin has rarely been
confused with an accurate passer _ until Saturday.
	   Martin, who took over for Tennessee hero Peyton Manning this
season, set three NCAA records as he completed 23 of 24 passes for
315 yards and four touchdowns in the third-ranked Volunteers' 49-14
win over South Carolina.
	   Martin, who entered the game hitting 51.7 percent of his passes,
set an NCAA record by completing 95.8 percent of his throws against
the Gamecocks, beating the mark of 92.6 percent (25-of-27) set by
UCLA's Rick Neuheisel in 1983.
	   The 6-foot-3, 215-pounder also set NCAA records for consecutive
completions in one game (23) and two games (24). Martin completed
his final pass against Alabama last week.
	   ``It's hard to set a lot of passing records here in only two
years,'' Martin said, referring to the dozens set by Manning in his
four years at Tennessee.
	   Martin's 23 consecutive completions in one game topped the NCAA
mark of 22 by Iowa's Chuck Long in 1984, the SEC mark of 20 set by
Mississippi's Ken Austin and Manning's school mark of 12. The
two-game total topped the mark of 23 shared by Southern
California's Rob Johnson and Maryland's Scott Milanovich.
	   He had TD passes of 21 and 2 yards and then hooked up with
Peerless Price on TD passes of 13 and 71 yards as the Vols (7-0,
5-0 SEC) built a 42-0 lead after three quarters.
	   On the play after Martin broke the consecutive completion record
_ a 10-yard swing pass to Price in the third quarter _ Martin's bid
at perfection ended when a pass was too high for Price.
	   South Carolina (1-8, 0-7) lost its eighth straight. The last
time the Gamecocks lost more games in a season was 1966, when they
finished 1-9.
	   In other early Top 25 games Saturday, it was No. 4 Kansas State
54, Kansas 6; No. 10 Penn State 27, Illinois 0; No. 14 Arkansas 24,
Auburn 21; No. 17 Syracuse 45, Pittsburgh 28; No. 20 Virginia Tech
27, No. 21 West Virginia 13; No. 22 Michigan 15, Minnesota 10; and
No. 23 Georgia Tech 31, Maryland 14.
	   In later games, it was No. 1 Ohio State at Indiana, Stanford at
No. 2 UCLA, North Carolina at No. 5 Florida State, Texas at No. 7
Nebraska, No. 8 Texas A&AMP;M at Oklahoma State, No. 12 Oregon at No.
13 Arizona, No. 15 Virginia at Wake Forest, Baylor at No. 16 Notre
Dame, No. 18 Missouri at Texas Tech, Southwestern Louisiana at No.
19 Tulane and Boston College at No. 25 Miami.
 &UR; No. 4 Kansas St. 54, Kansas 6 &QC; 
	   At Lawrence, Kansas, Michael Bishop scored two TDs and had 320
all-purpose yards (225 passing, 95 rushing) as the Wildcats moved
to 8-0 for the first time in their history.
	   K-State (5-0 Big 12) held Kansas (3-6, 1-6) to 44 total yards on
48 plays. David Winbush, who had 268 yards in last week's upset of
Colorado, had just 19 against the Wildcats on a rain-drenched
field. Martin Gramatica added a school-record four field goals for
K-State.
 &UR; No. 10 Penn St. 27, Illinois 0 &QC; 
	   At State College, Pennsylvania, Kevin Thompson (19-of-26 for 269
yards) set up two TDs with long passes to Chafie Fields and threw a
10-yard score to Corey Jones _ all in the first half _ for the
Nittany Lions (6-1, 3-1 Big Ten).
	   Illinois (2-7, 1-5) had 244 total yards.
 &UR; No. 14 Arkansas 24, Auburn 21 &QC; 
	   At Auburn, Alabama, the Razorbacks (7-0, 4-0 SEC) overcame five
turnovers and held on against the Tigers (2-6, 1-5) when Eric
Branch scored the go-ahead TD on a 14-yard run in the third
quarter.
	   Clint Stoerner was 18-of-28 for 232 yards, one TD and two
interceptions for the Hogs.
 &UR; No. 17 Syracuse 45, Pittsburgh 28 &QC; 
	   At Syracuse, New York, the Orangemen (5-2, 3-0 Big East) started
slowly but Donovan McNabb threw for two TDs, ran for another and
finished with 326 all-purpose yards.
	   McNabb was 12-of-23 for 228 yards and ran for 98 more against
the Panthers (2-5, 0-3). Syracuse scored two TDs in an 18-second
span midway through the fourth quarter to extend a 31-28 lead.
 &UR; No. 20 Virginia Tech 27, No. 21 West Virginia 13 &QC; 
	   At Blacksburg, Virginia, Ike Charlton intercepted three passes,
the defense made two goal-line stands and Al Clark threw two TD
passes in his first start in six weeks for the Hokies (7-1, 4-1 Big
East).
	   The Hokies also blocked a punt for a TD and finished with four
interceptions and four sacks against Marc Bulger of West Virginia
(4-3, 1-2).
 &UR; No. 22 Michigan 15, Minnesota 10 &QC; 
	   At Minneapolis, the Wolverines (6-2, 5-0 Big Ten) won their
sixth straight game and 12th consecutive Little Brown Jug with
another strong defensive effort.
	   Michigan broke a 10-10 tie when James Hall sacked Billy
Cockerham in the end zone for a safety early in the fourth quarter.
Tai Streets had six catches for 192 yards, including a 76-yard TD
grab in the first half, for the Wolverines.
	   The Golden Gophers fell to 4-4, 1-4.
 &UR; No. 23 Georgia Tech 31, Maryland 14 &QC; 
	   At Baltimore, Dez White returned a kickoff 100 yards and Joe
Burns' 44-yard TD run sparked a second-half surge for the Yellow
Jackets (6-2, 5-1 ACC).
	   Burns carried 20 times for 179 yards _ 146 in the second half _
as Georgia Tech pulled away from a 14-14 halftime tie with the
Terrapins (2-6, 0-5).
	   Also:
	   _ At Bowling Green, Ohio, Marshall (8-1, 6-1 MAC) fell from the
unbeaten ranks as Bob Niemet ran for one TD and passed for two more
as Bowling Green (3-5, 3-2) beat the Thundering Herd 34-13.

Moderate quake strikes areas north of Tokyo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A moderate earthquake with a preliminary magnitude
of 4.2 rattled areas northeast of Tokyo early Sunday, but there
were no reports of damage or injuries, the Central Meteorological
Agency said.
	   The quake, which struck at 3:01 (1801 GMT Saturday), was
centered about 60 kilometers (37.2 miles) beneath the surface of
northern Ibaraki Prefecture (State).
	   There was no fear of tsunami, or tidal waves caused by undersea
disturbances such as earthquakes or volcanic activity, the agency
said.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as it
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.

Outrage over police brutality after crackdown on Christian village

<TEXT>
	   EL-KUSHEH, Egypt (AP) _ It began inconspicuously. Two young
Christians killed in a poor region of Egypt known for its vendettas
and guns.
	   The police crackdown that followed in the mostly Christian
farming town wasn't commonplace, however. Villagers, human rights
groups and church officials say hundreds were arrested in a
monthlong campaign of terror that included torture, threats of
rape, hostage-taking and even bribes to officers for lenient
treatment.
	   The story has struck a nerve in Egypt and abroad because it
touches on a sensitive matter: the status of Egypt's small and
sometimes vulnerable Christian minority.
	   But beneath the charges and recriminations may rest a bigger
question about abuses by a powerful security force that fought and
defeated Islamic militants. Many say it now seems to act as a law
unto itself, with little oversight and less accountability.
	   ``It is not a matter of national unity,'' said Rifaat el-Said,
an Egyptian opposition leader. ``It is a matter of the behavior of
the police and a matter of human rights.''
	   The ordeal began with the overtones of religious strife, a
specter that hangs ominously over southern Egypt and its Coptic
Christian minority. For years, Muslim militants occasionally
targeted them as part of their insurgency against the government
that has cost more than 1,250 lives since 1992.
	   The two men, aged 25 and 27, were found dead in front of a
village school in August. Human rights groups and villagers said
police feared the killer was Muslim and were wary of the
repercussions that might have on a town 70 percent Christian and 30
percent Muslim. Police, they said, wanted a Christian suspect.
	   In ensuing weeks, reports said hundreds were detained, including
elderly residents, women and even an 18-month-old boy taken in with
his mother. Villagers said more than 1,000 were detained; human
rights investigators said it was at least 300.
	   ``The police acted as their temper dictated,'' said Basada
Gabriel Abdel-Masih, a priest in the village.
	   The government says only 14 people were detained as part of ``an
ordinary criminal investigation.'' About a dozen claims of torture
were investigated, and none was found to have occurred, said Nabil
Osman, an Egyptian government spokesman.
	   ``There is no proof that there was torture,'' he said.
	   But at Abdel-Masih's Church of the Angel in el-Kusheh, where
minarets and steeples rise above the dirt roads and squat huts,
villagers in dirty peasant gowns, their faces swarthy from work in
the fields, gathered to show the aftermath of their detention.
	   The ankles and wrists of some still bore the signs of what they
said were cuts from plastic or rough cloth used to string them from
the ceiling. Others showed scars they said were left by electric
shocks to their ears, abdomen and genitals.
	   Boktor Abul-Yamin, a 60-year-old villager who police initially
believed killed the two men, said he received shocks and beatings
until he vomited blood. Police detained his entire family and
threatened to rape his wife and daughters, he said.
	   They also held him for 34 days, he said, then released him when
another Christian was charged.
	   ``They beat me like a donkey,'' said Abul-Yamin. ``Now when I
see a policeman in the street, I think he's a devil. The way he
looks, he's a devil.
	   ``There are no laws in this village.''
	   Sensitive to any criticism of its treatment of Christians, the
government has reacted fiercely to suggestions the police crackdown
was motivated by the villagers' faith.
	   From President Hosni Mubarak down, officials have said the
charges are a plot to discredit Egypt and that no discrimination _
legal or otherwise _ is tolerated against Christians.
	   But critics say missing in the denials is any pledge to curb the
excesses by police, a force the Egyptian Organization of Human
Rights said acted as though they enjoyed ``total immunity from
accountability and punishment.''
	   The crackdown in El-Kusheh follows another widely reported
incident in which the brother of a theft suspect was killed in
custody, reportedly by electrocution. His death provoked a riot in
April in the Nile Delta town of Belqas.
	   ``Security is like a fire,'' warned Milad Hanna, a Coptic
Christian and former lawmaker. ``A small amount is useful and gives
warmth. A big amount engulfs the whole house.''

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Even the ``Merlin'' soundtrack couldn't bring
back Elvis Stojko's magic Saturday.
	   Showing rust from eight months away with a groin injury, Stojko
capped his return to competition with a shaky Skate America routine
that left him fourth behind two Russians and an upstart American.
	   Reigning world champion Alexei Yagudin triumphed in the
international event, withstanding runner-up Michael Weiss of
Fairfax, Virginia, and his equally flawless routine.
	   Yagudin won dlrs 30,000 for the victory, which came despite a
minor deduction for doing one more than the eight allowed triple
jumps.
	   ``When I'm skating, it's so hard to think about which jumps I
did, which not,'' he said, awed by his feat against a heady field.
``It's a pleasure for me.''
	   Said Stojko: ``You can't win them all.''
	   Alexei Urmanov finished third, unable to rekindle the rivalry
some had expected this week with three-time world champion Stojko,
whom Urmanov edged for Olympic gold at Lillehammer in 1994.
	   ``I feel good,'' said Urmanov, also trying to work his way back
from a groin injury. ``I have to work more, I believe, because the
other skaters are better than me. But I feel good.''
	   Earlier Saturday, reigning world champions and Olympic silver
medalists Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of Russia held
their lead and won the pairs title.
	   Guided by a new coach, the 18-year-old Yagudin cleanly landed
all of his jumps during Saturday's routine to ``Lawrence of
Arabia'' music and skated away with marks never lower than 5.8,
two-tenths shy of perfection.
	   Yagudin had entered the decisive free skate leading after the
short program two days earlier, then fended off a charge by Weiss,
runner-up in the U.S. championships the past two years.
	   To the music of Disney's ``Mulan,'' Weiss skated his way to a
crowd's standing ovation and the tearful embrace of his wife and
choreographer, Lisa. Stuffed animals and bouquets rained onto the
rink.
	   ``When I first found out who was going to be here, I knew it
wasn't only our first event of the season, but this was going to be
a big event,'' he said. ``This is like the world championships.
	   ``To come out and skate that well, to get the confidence because
the judges rewarded me, it was very encouraging.''
	   At 22, Weiss still is growing as a skater. He won the world
junior championships in 1994, then struggled to work his way up at
the senior ranks.
	   Always athletic, he worked on his artistic style to find
something to set him apart. His breakthrough came in 1997, when
during the U.S. championships he appeared to be the first American
to land a quadruple toe loop jump.
	   The jump later was disallowed, but Weiss had arrived.
	   Weiss finished seventh at Nagano and did better last month at
the Keri Lotion Figure Skating Classic in Florida, placing second
and two spots ahead of Olympic champion Ilia Kulik.
	   And on Saturday, he outshined Stojko and Urmanov.
	   Urmanov missed all of last season _ including a chance to repeat
as Olympic champion _ but made his return a rewarding one _ a
silver medal at last summer's Goodwill Games in New York.
	   Before this week, Stojko hasn't competed since February, when he
braved a torn groin of his own en route to the silver at the Nagano
Games.
	   The rust showed Saturday for Stojko, who landed several of his
jumps shakily but escaped with marks no lower than a 5.5 from an
American judge. Urmanov skated cleanly, sticking all of his jumps
and finishing with kisses blown to the crowd.
	   ``It's a situation where I concentrate a little more on certain
things just to make sure that I'm over my feet and I don't do a
technique that's going to aggravate an injury,'' Stojko said.
	   ``I wasn't really worried about that while I was out there, but
it's still in the back of my mind.''
	   Canada's Kristy Sargeant and Kris Wirtz finished second in the
pairs. Russians Victoria Maksuta and Vladislav Zhovnirsky were
third, overtaking American siblings Danielle and Steve Hartsell of
nearby Westland, Michigan.
	   Americans Kyoka Ina and John Zimmerman vaulted four spots and
finished fourth in their first competition together. Ina and former
partner Jason Dungjen won two U.S. pair titles _ in 1997 and 1998 _
before Ina broke up the duo last season.
	   The first event in the International Skating Union's Grand Prix
series, Skate America features Olympic-eligible skaters. The series
ends in Russia in March, two weeks before the world championships
in Finland.

outside the edge of the box to win the game for South Korea. He
also emerged as the tournament's top scorer, with six goals.
	   The 31st edition of the tournament was played in the northern
city of Chiang Mai.

	   Maj. Evenor Carcamo, head of civil defense in the region, said
authorities tried to fly Saturday to the town reportedly affected,
but had to turn back because of bad weather. Posoltega, in the
northwestern province of Chinadega, has a population of about
14,000.
	   Officially, Nicaragua reported 121 dead from heavy rains and
flash flooding there. Another 151 people were listed as missing in
Nicaragua, the National Civil Defense System reported Saturday.
	   Mitch _ once one of the strongest hurricanes to hit the
Caribbean _ was downgraded to a tropical depression, but continued
to dump heavy rain on the region.
	   At least 131 people were reported killed in Tegucigalpa after
floodwaters rose to the third floor of some buildings in the
Honduran capital Saturday. Army helicopters rescued some flood
victims clinging to rooftops.
	   ``This is a national catastrophe without any comparison,'' said
Gen. Mario Hung Pacheco, head of Honduras' armed forces.
	   Hundreds of houses were washed away, seven of Tegucigalpa's ten
bridges were knocked out and patients were evacuated from the third
floor of the city's Social Security hospital after the Rio Grande
river overflowed its banks Saturday.

	   ``I lost everything, I wasn't able to rescue a thing,'' said
Maria Lopez, 46, whose home near Tegucigalpa's international
airport disappeared without a trace in the flood waters.
	   Hundreds of thousands of people in Honduras and Nicaragua had
fled or lost their homes. Failing communications prevented
authorities from issuing damage estimates _ Honduras'
transportation ministry said almost all the country's roads had
been cut _ but banana producers said they had lost their entire
crop.
	   ``Superhuman efforts are under way to aid the flood victims,''
said Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse, after he traveled to
the city's international airport aboard a U.S. military aircraft
based at the nearby Palmerola airbase. The terminal is closed to
regular air traffic. Flores Facusse declared the city ``a disaster
zone.''
	   Honduran authorities asked the United Nations for aid in
assisting flood victims. Food and medicine were in particularly
short supply. ``The government does not have the capacity to help
all the victims,'' said Health Minister Marco Antonio Rosa.
	   At sea in the Caribbean, two U.S. Coast Guard C-130 planes
continued the search for a tourist schooner with 31 people that had
reported being rocked by then-Hurricane Mitch on Tuesday.
	   By late Saturday, Mitch's winds _ once near 180 mph (288 kph) _
had dropped to 35 mph (55 kph) and the storm was located about 75
miles (120 kms) south of Santa Rosa de Copan, Honduras, moving west
at 7 mph (11 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center reported.
	   Neighboring El Salvador _ where 30 people died in flash floods _
declared a state of emergency Saturday, as did Guatemala, where
nine people died when floodwaters swept away their homes. Mexico
reported one death from Mitch on Monday.

	   Police fanned out across Tegucigalpa to stem what National
Police Chief Col. Napoleon Flores Ponce said were hundreds of
people robbing stores in the capital. Police had orders to ``take
drastic action'' to stop the looting, he told a local radio
station.
	   The Coast Guard reported that two Swiss citizens were rescued
from a life raft after their 33-foot yacht (10.5-meter) yacht went
down Monday in the Caribbean, but there was still no sign of a
258-foot (77-meter) schooner, the Fantome, missing since Tuesday.
	   The Antigua-registered Fantome, once owned by Aristotle Onassis,
is operated out of Miami by Windjammer Barefoot Cruises.
	   After dropping its tourist passengers off in Belize Monday
morning, the crew headed toward Roatan Island, off the north coast,
to escape the hurricane _ which for two days was centered near that
island.
	   In their last communication, the crew of the Fantome said they
were experiencing 100-knot winds and 40-degree rolls, said
Windjammer spokesman James Canty.
	   The ship carried an emergency transmitter, but no signal has
been received from that transponder, according to the Coast Guard.
	   With rainfall of 4 inches (10 cms) an hour at the height of the
storm, downed bridges, rampant rivers, toppled trees and mudslides
had isolated hundreds of communities where food, water and medicine
were in short supply.
	   A Nicaraguan army helicopter set out to investigate reports that
many more people may have drowned in the northern town of
Posoltega, near the Honduran border, but turned back because of bad
weather.
	   In Tegucigalpa, thousands sought refuge in government shelters.
About 30,000 had been taken Friday to shelters in the nation's
second city, San Pedro Sula in the north.
	   The British Ministry of Defense said that it sent a Royal Navy
frigate based in the West Indies to Honduras Saturday to help in
assisting flood victims.
	   In small coastal communities near San Pedro Sula army troops and
fire fighters moved in with small boats to rescue people still
clinging to roof tops.
	   Clara Bonilla, a 31-year-old mother, spent the night in a school
bus near San Pedro Sula with her four children.
	   ``It got very cold in the night, and no one has given us much
help,'' Bonilla said as she clutched her youngest daughter.

flash flooding there. Another 151 people were listed as missing in
Nicaragua, the National Civil Defense System reported Saturday.
	   Mitch _ once one of the strongest hurricanes to hit the
Caribbean _ was downgraded to a tropical depression, but continued
to dump heavy rain on the region.
	   At least 131 people were reported killed in Tegucigalpa after
floodwaters rose to the third floor of some buildings in the
Honduran capital Saturday. Army helicopters rescued some flood
victims clinging to rooftops.
	   ``This is a national catastrophe without any comparison,'' said
Gen. Mario Hung Pacheco, head of Honduras' armed forces.
	   Hundreds of houses were washed away, seven of Tegucigalpa's ten
bridges were knocked out and patients were evacuated from the third
floor of the city's Social Security hospital after the Rio Grande
river overflowed its banks Saturday.
	   ``I lost everything, I wasn't able to rescue a thing,'' said
Maria Lopez, 46, whose home near Tegucigalpa's international
airport disappeared without a trace in the flood waters.
	   Hundreds of thousands of people in Honduras and Nicaragua had
fled or lost their homes. Failing communications prevented
authorities from issuing damage estimates _ Honduras'
transportation ministry said almost all the country's roads had
been cut _ but banana producers said they had lost their entire
crop.
	   ``Superhuman efforts are under way to aid the flood victims,''
said Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse, after he traveled to
the city's international airport aboard a U.S. military aircraft
based at the nearby Palmerola airbase. The terminal is closed to
regular air traffic. Flores Facusse declared the city ``a disaster
zone.''
	   Honduran authorities asked the United Nations for aid in
assisting flood victims. Food and medicine were in particularly
short supply. ``The government does not have the capacity to help
all the victims,'' said Health Minister Marco Antonio Rosa.
	   At sea in the Caribbean, two U.S. Coast Guard C-130 planes
continued the search for a tourist schooner with 31 people that had
reported being rocked by then-Hurricane Mitch on Tuesday.
	   By late Saturday, Mitch's winds _ once near 180 mph (288 kph) _
had dropped to 35 mph (55 kph) and the storm was located about 75
miles (120 kms) south of Santa Rosa de Copan, Honduras, moving west
at 7 mph (11 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center reported.
	   Neighboring El Salvador _ where 30 people died in flash floods _
declared a state of emergency Saturday, as did Guatemala, where
nine people died when floodwaters swept away their homes. Mexico
reported one death from Mitch on Monday.
	   Police fanned out across Tegucigalpa to stem what National
Police Chief Col. Napoleon Flores Ponce said were hundreds of
people robbing stores in the capital. Police had orders to ``take
drastic action'' to stop the looting, he told a local radio
station.
	   With rainfall of 4 inches (10 cms) an hour at the height of the
storm, downed bridges, rampant rivers, toppled trees and mudslides
had isolated hundreds of communities where food, water and medicine
were in short supply.
	   In Tegucigalpa, thousands sought refuge in government shelters.
About 30,000 had been taken Friday to shelters in the nation's
second city, San Pedro Sula in the north.
	   The British Ministry of Defense said that it sent a Royal Navy
frigate based in the West Indies to Honduras Saturday to help in
assisting flood victims.
	   In small coastal communities near San Pedro Sula army troops and
fire fighters moved in with small boats to rescue people still
clinging to roof tops.
	   Clara Bonilla, a 31-year-old mother, spent the night in a school
bus near San Pedro Sula with her four children.
	   ``It got very cold in the night, and no one has given us much
help,'' Bonilla said as she clutched her youngest daughter.

Morgan ties Inman in second round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Gil Morgan's 10-foot (3-meter) birdie putt on
the 18th hole capped a 3-under-par 68 Saturday and lifted him into
a share of second-round lead of the dlrs 1.1 million Pacific Bell
Senior PGA Classic with Joe Inman.
	   The two were part of a three-way tie for the first-round lead
and were knotted again Saturday at 8-under 134, two strokes in
front of George Archer, who had a 66.
	   Inman, who also had a 68, took a two-shot lead into the
finishing hole but bogeyed to open the way for Morgan. Inman missed
a par-saving putt from 20 feet after his approach shot had missed
the green.
	   Hubert Green birdied No. 17 then eagled the par-4 18th for a 65,
the day's low round. He was at 5-under 137 with Ed Dougherty, the
third first-round leader, who had a 71.
	   Green's second shot on the 444-yard (405-meter) closing hole was
a 6-iron.
	   Lee Trevino's par round of 71 left him in a four-way tie at four
under with Bobby Stroble, 68, Allen Doyle, 69, and Brian Barnes,
70.
	   Morgan is looking for his third consecutive victory at the
6,575-yard (6,010-meter) Wilshire Country Club course. He has won
six tournaments this year and only Hale Irwin, who is not playing
this week, has won as many.
	   ``My game is a little haywire and I never did feel comfortable
out there,'' Morgan said. ``I just never got the ball close to the
hole. Hopefully, I'll have some better opportunities for birdies
tomorrow.''
	   Morgan three-putted No. 9 for his only bogey and his 10-foot
(3-meter) birdie at the final hole was the longest putt he made
Saturday.
	   ``The ball was in the wrong spot a lot,'' Morgan added. ``I
never had the ball in position to make a solid run at the hole.''
	   Inman was confident after Friday's round that he could compete
with the stars of the Senior PGA Tour but had expressed doubts
about his ability to win.
	   ``I just went to sleep a few times,'' Inman said. ``You have to
think on every shot out here because this course all depends on
placement.''
	   Inman birdied five of the first 11 holes but posted bogeys on
three of the final seven.
	   ``This game is very frustrating,'' Inman added. ``I feel like
I've been doing good work but haven't gotten a lot out of it.''
	   Archer, 59, has continued his comeback from hip replacement
surgery in April 1996. He won dlrs 400,000 in 1997 and has banked
nearly dlrs 600,000 in prize money this year. Archer ranks 27th on
the money list and is assured of a spot in next week's dlrs 2
million Senior Tour Championship which is open to only the top 31
on this year's money list.
	   ``I've had seven major operations in my life,'' Archer said.
``I've been cut on more than a piece of meat. And I still have
problems with the muscles in my hip.''
	   Archer didn't post a birdie until No. 8, then made four more
over the final nine without a bogey in his round.
	   ``I made five birdies without a birdie on any of the par-5,''
Archer added. ``That's unusual. And I didn't have to do any
scrambling until the final hole. I was very patient today.''
	   Archer has won 17 times on the senior tour and finished one shot
behind Morgan here last year.
	   Dougherty and Inman both have a chance to finish in the top 31
if they can win or finish second alone.
	   Arnold Palmer, returning to the senior tour after seven weeks of
radiation treatment to follow up successful surgery for prostate
cancer, had a 74 Saturday but was well off the pace at 13-over 155.

 &UR; Thousands take to streets to support Asian Games
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with official figures, other details

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Almost 10,000 runners, along with some
of their canine friends, took to the streets of Bangkok Sunday to
raise money for Thai athletes at the upcoming Asian Games.
	   South Korea's Samsung Electronics Company, one of the Games'
sponsors, pledged a donation of one U.S. dollar for every
participant in the 5-kilometer ``fun run.''
	   The money will go to the Amateur Athletics Association of
Thailand to help athletes at the Dec. 6-20 Asian Games which will
be staged in Bangkok.
	   Taking part Sunday were celebrities, sports stars, youngsters
and even a few pet dogs that trotted alongside their masters. A
wheelchair race was also staged.
	   Winning the men's 5K was Nuntakorn Chukaew in a time of 14
minutes, 55 seconds, while Vilaiwan Khumpitak registered the best
women's time, a 16:58:00.
	   The Asian Games will attract 43 countries from across the
continent. A number, including Thailand, are finding it difficult
to field full, well-trained teams in wake of the Asian economic
crisis.
	   The sponsor, which will stage similar runs in Beijing and New
Delhi, said 9,700 people took part in the Bangkok run but rounded
off the figure to 10,000 and signed a check for dlrs 10,000.
	   ``While today's activities will raise money and help our
athletes prepare for the Asian Games, they will also pass on a
strong message of support and encouragement from all Thai people,''
said Gen. Chetta Thanajaro, chairman of the Thai National Olympic
Committee, at the event.

U.N. Security Council calls on Iraq to reverse its decision
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Hoping to avert another showdown with
Iraq, the U.N. Security Council has demanded that Baghdad reverse
its decision to cut off all dealings with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The council called Saturday's announcement from Baghdad ``a
flagrant violation'' of council resolutions and of an understanding
between Iraq and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The written
understanding averted military action against Iraq in February over
another inspections crisis.
	   The statement also reiterated the council's offer to review
Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions if it resumes cooperation
with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, the outgoing council
president, read the press statement to reporters after an 80-minute
meeting of the 15-member council. A press statement reflects the
council's views, but unlike a council resolution, it is not binding
on members.
	   Council members agreed on a press statement as a quick response
to the Iraqi announcement, but member states have not had a chance
yet to fully assess Baghdad's action.
	   ``Governments involved in this will be taking their own
decisions when they've fully considered with each other what needs
to be done,'' Greenstock said. ``We will decide over the next few
days what further steps are to be taken.''
	   Acting U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh, who assumes the council
presidency on Sunday, said the council would proceed ``on a step by
step basis.''
	   When asked whether the United States might threaten military
action if Baghdad doesn't allow inspections to resume, Burleigh
replied: ``I'm not going to comment on that.''
	   Before the council finished its consultations, Iraq's ambassador
to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, told reporters there that
inspectors would be physically barred if they attempted to get to
any monitoring sites.
	   The U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, whose inspectors
are charged with destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, had
not been ordered to leave Iraq, and the Security Council was not
recommending that they depart, Greenstock said.
	   Charles Duelfer, UNSCOM's deputy executive chairman, said in a
letter to Greenstock that the commission's representatives in
Baghdad had been informed during a meeting that all UNSCOM
activities would be halted, including monitoring, but ``members of
the commission's monitoring teams are not requested to depart from
Iraq.''
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton's national security
advisers were reviewing the situation and consulting with allies
and U.N. officials, said David Leavy, a spokesman for the U.S.
National Security Council. ``We view this as a serious matter,''
Leavy said.
	   The latest dispute with Iraq began Aug. 5, when Baghdad
announced that teams from USCOM and the atomic agency could no
longer carry out surprise inspections. But Iraq allowed both groups
to continue long-term monitoring at previously identified weapons
sites.
	   In an attempt to get Baghdad to resume full inspections, the
Security Council offered to conduct a ``comprehensive review'' of
Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions. Baghdad demanded that the
review lead directly to the removal of sweeping trade sanctions
imposed in 1990 after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait, sparking the
Gulf War.
	   But a letter that the Security Council sent to Annan Friday on
the broad outlines of a comprehensive review of Iraqi compliance
made no mention of lifting sanctions.
	   Angered at the council for ignoring its demand, Iraq announced
Saturday that it would cut off all dealings with U.N. weapons
inspectors. The decision by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his
top advisers exempted only a handful of experts from the
International Atomic Energy Agency, who monitor suspected nuclear
sites.
	   Hamdoon called the comprehensive review offered by the council
``not helpful'' and ``counterproductive,'' and laid the blame
squarely on the United States.
	   ``The American delegation made it clear that this whole issue of
review is not about lifting sanctions'' and insisted that any
reference to ending sanctions should not be mentioned, Hamdoon
said. ``And that had, I think, I major impact on the Iraqi
reaction.''
	   ``We have left the door open for the Security Council to review
the status of affairs and to come up with something that Iraq could
deal with,'' he said.
	   Three permanent Security Council members _ Russia, China and
France _ have previously been sympathetic to Iraq's campaign to
finish the task of disarming so sanctions can be lifted. A
crippling oil embargo cannot be lifted until UNSCOM certifies that
Iraq has eliminated its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
and the missiles to deliver them.
	   Burleigh stressed that the entire council backed the press
statement.
	   ``I want to underscore the unanimous and very solid and very
strong reaction of the council to this really dismaying Iraqi
decision,'' Burleigh said.
	   Diplomats said the secretary-general's special envoy to Iraq,
Prakash Shah, who is in Bahrain, will be returning to Iraq. The
Indian diplomat has been acting as a liaison between Annan and
Baghdad since the last crisis with Iraq over weapons inspections
ended in February.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ The confirmed death toll from one
of the strongest hurricanes to hit the Caribbean has risen to 392,
with deadly mudslides still wreaking havoc in Honduras and
Nicaragua.
	   Unconfirmed radio reports Saturday also said as many as 4,000
people may have been killed in the northwestern Nicaraguan town of
Posoltega. But Maj. Evenor Carcamo, head of the National Civil
Defense System in the region, said authorities were unable to fly
Saturday to Posoltega to check out the reports because of bad
weather. About 14,000 people live in the town.
	   ``The radio reports we have indicate that there is a seriously
grave situation'' in Posoltega, in the northwestern province of
Chinadega near the Honduran border, said Gen. Joaquin Cuadra, head
of the Nicaraguan army. ``It is one of the places most affected and
we do not have access by air or land.''
	   Officially, Nicaragua reported 121 dead from heavy rain and
flash flooding there. Another 151 people are listed as missing in
Nicaragua, the National Civil Defense reported.
	   Defense Minister Pedro J. Chamorro Barrios announced Saturday
evening that Nicaragua had asked the United States to loan several
large helicopters to help assess casualties and damage in remote
areas and take aid to affected communities.
	   In Honduras, at least 231 people have been confirmed dead from
former Hurricane Mitch, the National Emergency Commission said
Saturday.

Amazing _ Nebraska loses again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late afternoon games; WILL be UPDATED with night
games. &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLUMBIA, South Carolina (AP) _ Tee Martin set three NCAA
records as he completed 23 of 24 passes for 315 yards and four
touchdowns for the Volunteers.
	   Martin set an NCAA record by completing 95.8 percent of his
throws against the Gamecocks, beating the mark of 92.6 percent
(25-of-27) set by UCLA's Rick Neuheisel in 1983. The 6-foot-3,
215-pounder also set NCAA records for consecutive completions in
one game (23) and two games (24). Martin completed his final pass
against Alabama last week.
	   South Carolina (1-8, 0-7) lost its eighth straight.
	   Texas took two giant steps forward, Nebraska took one backward.
	   Ricky Williams ran for 150 yards and Major Applewhite threw a
2-yard touchdown pass with 2:47 left as the revived Longhorns
stunned No. 7 Nebraska 20-16 Saturday _ ending the Huskers' 47-game
home winning streak.
	   ``This win really hasn't hit me yet. I'm in awe,'' Texas wide
receiver Bryan White said.
	   If he's in awe, the Huskers are in shock in coach Frank Solich's
first season after replacing Tom Osborne. Not only have they lost
two games in a season, but it looks like they no longer can
dominate teams they way they used to.
	   ``It does hurt for our players, without question,'' Solich said.
``No one wants to have a streak come to an end. They're taking it
very, very hard. They just don't feel very good about things right
now.''
	   For Texas, the win not only gives new coach Mack Brown the big
win he needs to win the support of the Longhorn faithful, but it
enhances Williams chances at winning the Heisman Trophy.
	   Texas (6-2, 4-1 Big 12) handed Nebraska (7-2, 3-2) its first
home loss since Sept. 21, 1991, when Washington won 36-21, while
Williams' 150 yards was the most Nebraska allowed an opposing
runner since Barry Sanders in 1988, the year the Oklahoma State
star won the Heisman.
	   Texas beat Nebraska 37-27 in the 1996 Big 12 title game the last
time the teams played.
	   Nebraska went ahead 16-13 with 8:33 to play on Kris Brown's
42-yard field goal after the Longhorns tied it with 13:38 remaining
on Kris Stockton's 19-yard field goal.
	   Eric Crouch took over at quarterback for an ineffective Monte
Christo _ starter Bobby Newcombe is out with a knee injury _ and
rallied to take a 13-10 lead late in the third quarter.
	   Williams needed 37 carries to pick up his 150 yards _ moving him
within 294 of breaking Tony Dorsett's major college career rushing
mark of 6,082 yards. Williams had 82 yards in the first quarter.
	   In other Top 25 games Saturday, it was No. 1 Ohio State 38,
Indiana 7; No. 3 Tennessee 49, South Carolina 14; No. 4 Kansas
State 54, Kansas 6; No. 6 Florida 38, No. 11 Georgia 7; No. 10 Penn
State 27, Illinois 0; No. 14 Arkansas 24, Auburn 21; No. 15
Virginia 38, Wake Forest 17; No. 16 Notre Dame 27, Baylor 3; No. 17

Minnesota 10; No. 23 Georgia Tech 31, Maryland 14 and No. 25 Miami
35, Boston College 17.
	   In later games it was Stanford at No. 2 UCLA, North Carolina at
No. 5 Florida State, No. 8 Texas A and M at Oklahoma State and No.
12 Oregon at No. 13 Arizona.
 &UR; No. 1 Ohio St. 38, Indiana 7 &QC; 
	   At Bloomington, Indiana, David Boston returned a punt 70 yards
for a touchdown and caught two TD passes for the Buckeyes (8-0, 5-0
Big Ten).
	   Joe Germaine was 32-of-45 for 251 yards and three TDs as he
threw for over 300 yards a school-record fourth straight game.
 &UR; No. 4 Kansas St. 54, Kansas 6 &QC; 
	   At Lawrence, Kansas, Michael Bishop scored two TDs and had 320
all-purpose yards (225 passing, 95 rushing) as the Wildcats moved
to 8-0 for the first time in their history.
	   K-State (5-0 Big 12) held Kansas (3-6, 1-6) to 44 total yards on
48 plays. David Winbush, who had 268 yards in last week's upset of
Colorado, had just 19 against the Wildcats on a rain-drenched
field. Martin Gramatica added a school-record four field goals for
K-State.
 &UR; No. 6 Florida 38, No. 11 Georgia 7 &QC; 
	   At Jacksonville, Florida, Doug Johnson threw for two
first-quarter touchdowns, ran for another and caught a TD pass as
the Gators avenged last year's loss to the Bulldogs.
	   Florida (7-1, 5-1 SEC) stayed one game behind Tennessee in the
chase for the SEC East title. Georgia (6-2, 4-2) all but fell out
of the SEC and national title hunt.
 &UR; No. 10 Penn St. 27, Illinois 0 &QC; 
	   At State College, Pennsylvania, Kevin Thompson (19-of-26 for 269
yards) set up two TDs with long passes to Chafie Fields and threw a
10-yard score to Corey Jones _ all in the first half _ for the
Nittany Lions (6-1, 3-1 Big Ten). Illinois (2-7, 1-5) had 244 total
yards.
 &UR; No. 14 Arkansas 24, Auburn 21 &QC; 
	   At Auburn, Alabama, the Razorbacks (7-0, 4-0 SEC) overcame five
turnovers and held on against the Tigers (2-6, 1-5) when Eric
Branch scored the go-ahead TD on a 14-yard run in the third
quarter.
	   Clint Stoerner was 18-of-28 for 232 yards, one TD and two
interceptions for the Hogs.
 &UR; No. 15 Virginia 38, Wake Forest 17 &QC; 
	   At Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Thomas Jones rushed for 142

Golding wins first leg of around-the-world solo race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Smashing the old speed record by
nearly 14 hours, Mike Golding of Britain roared into Cape Town on
Saturday to win the first leg of the Around Alone sailing race.
	   Making sail changes up to the last minute, Golding surprised the
two favorites, Isabelle Autissier and Marc Thiercelin, both of
France, who had traded the lead off and on since leaving
Charleston, South Carolina, on Sept. 27.
	   All three solo racers, piloting 60-foot (18-meter) boats, easily
beat the old course record set by Autissier in 1994.
	   Golding made the 7,000-mile (11,200-kilometer) trip in 34 days,
18 hours, 54 minutes and 44 seconds, beating Autissier only by
about 2 1/2 hours Saturday.
	   ``She did some tactical stuff that left us all (amazed). I'm
absolutely convinced that her boat is not as quick as mine or
SOMEWHERE,'' Golding said, referring to Thiercelin's yacht.
	   Three hours after Autissier arrived, Thiercelin made a dramatic
entrance just before sunset, screaming across the finish line as a
45 mph (72 kph) wind ripped his mainsail into shreds.
	   He could not hide his disappointment over losing the leg, or his
frustration with equipment failures that included a broken genoa
halyard earlier this week.
	   ``I had so many things go wrong. I thought I could win this leg
but it was not to be,'' Thiercelin said.
	   Another racer, Fedor Konioukhov of Russia, was reported to have
substantial leaks around his keel that left him 3,580 miles (5,760
kilometers) behind. It was not clear how he was going to resolve
the problem.
	   In the Class II category, for boats up to 50 feet (15 meters),
Jean-Pierre Mouligne of France had a 112-mile (180-kilometer) lead
Saturday over Brad Van Liew of Santa Monica, Ca. On that pace,
Mouligne would reach Cape Town around Nov. 8.
	   The 27,000-mile (43,450-kilometer) long Around Alone race is
divided into four legs. The racers will stop in Auckland, New
Zealand, and Punta del Este, Uruguay, before returning to
Charleston next spring.
	   The race began in 1982 and is held once every four years.

Army general, two MPs reported linked to drugs ring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A low-ranking soldier, who fears for
his life, has alleged that an army major-general and three
well-known politicians are members of a notorious narcotics gang, a
Bangkok newspaper said Sunday.
	   Quoting an unnamed army source, the Bangkok Post said Lance
Corporal Klinkachorn also admitted that he was a member of a ring
run by druglord Surachai ``Bang Ron'' Ngernthongfoo.
	   The corporal, who is under police detention, has asked for
protection from his commander.
	   The Post said the soldier has accused a general in the Defence
Ministry's Office of Policy and Planning as well as two members of
parliament and one former MP of being linked to the narcotics gang.
	   The names of the four were not revealed.
	   Last month, three gang members were arrested when more than
700,000 amphetamine pills were seized at Surachai's suburban home.
Vitoon's confession is regarded as a major breakthrough in the
case, the Post said.
	   Thai military men have in the past been engaged in drugs
trafficking, illegal logging, extortion and other criminal
activities but high-ranking officers have normally escaped
punishment.
	   The government of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has vowed to go
after criminals in uniform and is also seeking to reduce the
political power of the armed forces.

After 60 years, Dino De Laurentiis retains his zeal for making

movies &QL;

 &UR; By BOB THOMAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ His eyes clear behind tortoiseshell glasses,
an inch-(2.5-centimeter)-long cigarillo clenched between his teeth,
Dino De Laurentiis still works hard at a tycoon-size desk in his
Wilshire Boulevard office.
	   His ardor for filmmaking undimmed after 60 years, the legendary
producer from Naples will celebrate his 80th birthday next August
on Capri, his favorite place in the world. He spends a monthlong
holiday each year on the island and in Rome. The rest of the time
he's in Hollywood making deals, or somewhere in the world making
movies.
	   De Laurentiis has been involved in producing such diverse movies
as ``Bitter Rice,'' ``War and Peace,'' ``Nights of Cabiria,'' ``The
Bible,'' ``Waterloo,'' ``Serpico,'' ``Three Days of the Condor,''
``Ragtime'' and ``Conan the Barbarian.'' As executive producer or
producer, he's had at least 60 movies under his belt, high-brow and
low-brow, huge moneymakers and expensive flops.
	   One recent fall day, he talked about why he still loves making
movies. After 25 years in the United States, his Neapolitan roots
still color his speech, which is terse and emphatic.
	   ``Our industry is a special one. You deal every day with
different people, creative people. Every day is different at work.
To produce a movie, you have to create the star, you make script,
you find director. You have to shoot the movie.
	   ``We prepare a picture for Universal called 'U-571.' Is a
submarine movie in World War II. We have to build the submarine,
because they don't exist any more from World War II. We build it in
Malta. We start in January, a very expensive (dlrs 90 million)
movie.''
	   Growing up movie-crazy in prewar Naples, De Laurentiis dreamed
of becoming an actor. His father, who owned a spaghetti factory,
agreed to pay the boy's first year at the government's cinema
school in Rome, after which Dino would be on his own.
	   He found work as an actor and extra in films, but one day came
to a realization: ``I see my face in the mirror, and I said, 'No,
my ambition is not to be an actor.' I realized the exciting place
was behind the camera with the producer, director and so on. Then I
decided: change.''
	   At 19, he assembled all the elements to produce a movie in
Turin. He hesitated, fearing the script lacked popular appeal. One
day, he saw a Swedish film with an intriguing story. He bought the
remake rights.
	   The film was a success, but war interrupted his career. He
served in the army and, after Mussolini was shot, managed to escape
from Trieste, pass through German-occupied Rome and reach home in
Naples.
	   De Laurentiis played a major role as producer in the postwar
Italian films that stunned the world. Audiences marveled at the
vigor, truthfulness and humanity of works by such directors as
Fellini, Rossellini, Visconti, De Sica and Antonioni. The movement
was called ``neorealism.''
	   ```Neorealism' was invented by newspapers,'' scoffed De
Laurentiis. ``They claimed some directors and writers wanted to do
neorealism. Not true. Italian industry was so poor we had no money
for studio, to create the set, to go anyplace. So we had to shoot
everything in the street.''
	   A trophy case in the De Laurentiis office contains his Academy
Awards as producer of best foreign-language films during that
fertile period: ``La Strada'' (1954) and the recently re-released
``Nights of Cabiria'' (1957), both directed by Fellini.
	   De Laurentiis built a huge new studio on the outskirts of Rome,
called it Dinocitta (Dino city), and began producing spectacles
with Hollywood stars: ``War and Peace'' (Henry Fonda, Audrey
Hepburn), ``Barrabas'' (Anthony Quinn), ``The Bible'' (George C.
Scott, Ava Gardner), ``Anzio'' (Robert Mitchum), ``Waterloo'' (Rod
Steiger). None became a blockbuster.
	   De Laurentiis blames his retreat from Italy on the politicians.
To stimulate the industry, the government had subsidized
production, provided 50 percent of those involved were Italians.
	   ``The law in 1969-1970 was changed: 100 percent Italian,'' he
said. ``Then I say goodbye.''
	   He sold Dinocitta (renamed Cinecitta) to the government and
moved his base to New York and Hollywood. His American career has
been a mixed bag. Crime films like ``Death Wish'' and ``Three Days
of the Condor'' made money, but remakes of ``King Kong'' and
``Mutiny on the Bounty'' proved misguided. With big-budget flops
like ``Tai-Pan'' and ``Dune,'' his company fell into bankruptcy in
1988.
	   He continues overseeing one or two pictures a year, together
with his daughter, Rafaella.
	   ``My philosophy is very simple,'' he said. ``To feel young, you
must work as long as you can. Also, I have two young girls, 8 and
10. They really keep me young.''

Chinese opera bands keep on, despite waning interest
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Sin Yong Hua Heng opera company has come to
the neighborhood to perform traditional Chinese opera for three
nights.
	   An audience of 15 has gathered. Mirroring the state of this
dying art, they are mostly old people for whom the operas still
have meaning.
	   By nightfall, the stage, set up on a rickety wooden platform, is
dressed in warm lights and gaudy paint. The dozen or so veteran
performers are backstage applying the elaborate make-up traditional
to Chinese opera. Some characters take nearly an hour to come to
life.
	   By the time a small band starts playing music over the
loudspeakers, the performers have said hasty prayers in front of
the small backstage shrine and are ready to sing and act.
	   Members of the audience stand, or borrow folding chairs from a
nearby collection of food stalls.
	   Tan Khar Luang is a 25-year veteran of Chinese opera who plays
in the company with her four sisters, plus other relatives and
friends.
	   As a younger generation has become accustomed to pop music and
karaoke disc jockeys, opera companies are finding audiences hard to
come by.
	   Ten years ago, Tan says, there were nearly a dozen small opera
companies working in Singapore. Now, the Sin Yong Hua Heng is one
of only three companies remaining, she says.
	   The old costumes are fraying. Even with the care lavished on
them, they increasingly need the magic lighting of the stage to
give them the grand appearance of their youth.
	   About halfway into the 3 1-2 -hour performance, the nasal
singing of the opera is overwhelmed by a louder, brasher sound. A
temple society down the road is having an auction and lucky draw,
and the auctioneer is screaming into his microphone.
	   The opera audience now has to make sense of a complicated love
story mixed with the going price for a lava lamp. Many give up and
go home.
	   The dedication and enthusiasm of the players is undiminished,
however. Despite barking auctioneers and tiny audiences, the
close-knit company remains devoted to the art, spending hours
getting make-up perfect, mending costumes and adapting to the
primitive facilities of the mobile stage.

Keith's last stand _ in a library?

 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ After 36 death-defying years in the rock 'n'
roll business, Keith Richards finally faced his own mortality this
past May _ standing on a chair in his home library.
	   The Rolling Stones guitarist was trying to wrap his skull-ringed
fingers around a copy of Leonardo da Vinci's study of anatomy.
Instead, Richards found himself dodging an avalanche of books when
his bookshelf collapsed _ ``the Encyclopedia Britannica, heavy
volumes bombing me,'' he recalled.
	   ``It was one of those moments where you have to make a decision:
Take it on the ribs, or take a shot in the temple on a desk.''
	   The 54-year-old rocker laughs, in his familiar whiskey-nicotine
rasp. ``All part of life's rich pageant,'' he concludes.
	   The accident, and resulting broken rib, forced the cancellation
of several dates on the Stones' ``Bridges to Babylon'' album tour.
But three weeks later, Richards was back on stage; his performance
that night is captured on the Stones' seventh live album, ``No
Security.''
	   The record, due out Nov. 3, is the Stones' third live album in
the 1990s. So why another live offering? The Stones' leaders,
Richards and fellow Glimmer Twin Mick Jagger, offer two reasons.
	   Richards' explanation: ``I suppose it had something to do with
our record deal in the first place. But what got us interested was
that the band played so well, so consistently well, on this tour.''
	   Jagger echoed the latter sentiment.
	   ``One of the big differences between now and, say, the '70s, is
that the Rolling Stones are a much more consistent band now,''
Jagger says. ``Back then, some nights were fantastic. But some
shows, we'd hang our heads in our hands: `That was awful. What went
wrong?'''
	   The album chronicles the hugely successful ``Bridges to
Babylon'' tour, a worldwide jaunt that earned the band an estimated
dlrs 57 million. The tour stops included:
	   _ A gig in Moscow, Russia, where the communist regime banned
them 31 years ago as ``decadent.''
	   _ A show in Warsaw, Poland, where they last played in 1968 with
ex-bassist Bill Wyman and late guitarist Brian Jones.
	   _ A date in Athens, Greece, where Jagger was dragged offstage by
military police in 1967 after tossing red carnations at the crowd
in what the military junta of the time thought was a pro-Communist
gesture.
	   ``We just got out before the junta took over,'' Richards says.
	   The new album includes tracks from Stones dates in Amsterdam,
Holland; Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Nuremberg, Germany. As to the
difference between this album and previous live efforts by the
Stones ...
	   ``Somebody asked me that,'' Jagger says with a laugh. ``Like I
play them all the time. This morning, you know, I listened to `Love
You Live,' disc one.
	   ``I really have no idea.''
	   In deciding which songs from the Stones' lengthy catalogue might
make the album, Jagger came up with a simple solution for
drastically trimming any potential set list.
	   ``I made a list of all the songs we've released live since 1979,
and said, `We're not using any of these songs,''' Jagger relates.
``That made choosing much easier.''
	   The band did a bit of experimenting with guest stars: Dave
Matthews trade vocals on ``Memory Motel,'' and saxophonist Joshua
Redman re-creates Sonny Rollins' solo from ``Waiting on a Friend.''
	   ``Joshua was Charlie's idea,'' says Jagger, referring to drummer
Charlie Watts. ``He said that the guests don't all have to be
singers. It was a good idea.''
	   Richards believes the younger musicians are part of a musical
kinship he feels with older guitarists such as John Lee Hooker or
Buddy Guy.
	   ``It's so interesting,'' he says. ``Suddenly, you're with these
guys from all kinds of disparate times and areas, and you get in
the dressing room and realize you've known each other forever.''
	   And it seems as though the Stones have been around forever,
surviving a career that runs from the drug-stoked turbulence of the
'60s, through the disco era of the '70s, to the internal fighting
of the '80s and the onset of middle age in the 1990s.
	   The Stones teamed up on one track with another veteran:
guitarist Taj Majal, an old friend who appeared in the Stones'
recently released video, ``Rock and Roll Circus.'' The classic 1968
concert, which also included bits by an actual circus troupe, was
unearthed and released two years ago. The Stones were joined by the
Who, Jethro Tull and John Lennon at the show, which wound up
providing a bit of entertainment for Jagger's daughter, Heather.
	   ``She had never seen the Who before, and Pete Townshend lives
across the street from us,'' Jagger said. ``She had seen him, but
never understood what he did. So it was really strange. But then,
it was a strange event back then.''
	   And Heather's verdict on the show?
	   ``She liked it,'' Jagger says. ``I was so embarrassed when I was
taking my shirt off, but she said, `That's cool, dad.'''
	   Richards found the old show amusing, too. ``I just saw it a
couple of days ago,'' he says.
	   The future? Richards says the band is going back on the road
next year.
	   ``Certain guys go into the business, they want a bit of flash
and a couple of hits,'' Richards says dismissively. ``Any pancake
can stick to the wall for a while. For me, this is a career,
longevity. And all the people I work with feel the same way.
	   ``Maybe,'' he says slyly, ``we're just a bunch of late
bloomers.''

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ The death toll from one of the

said.

	   Officially, Nicaragua reported 121 dead from heavy rain and
flash flooding there. Another 151 people are listed as missing in
Nicaragua, the National Civil Defense reported.
	   Defense Minister Pedro J. Chamorro Barrios announced Saturday
evening that Nicaragua had asked the United States to loan several
large helicopters to help assess casualties and damage in remote
areas and take aid to affected communities.
	   In Honduras, at least 231 people have been confirmed dead from
former Hurricane Mitch, the National Emergency Commission said
Saturday.
	   Mitch _ once one of the strongest hurricanes to hit the
Caribbean _ was downgraded to a tropical depression, but continued
to dump heavy rain on the region.
	   At least 131 people were reported killed in Tegucigalpa after
floodwaters rose to the third floor of some buildings in the
Honduran capital Saturday. Army helicopters rescued some flood
victims clinging to rooftops.
	   ``This is a national catastrophe without any comparison,'' said
Gen. Mario Hung Pacheco, head of Honduras' armed forces.
	   Hundreds of houses were washed away, seven of Tegucigalpa's ten
bridges were knocked out and patients were evacuated from the third
floor of the city's Social Security hospital after the Rio Grande
river overflowed its banks Saturday.
	   ``I lost everything, I wasn't able to rescue a thing,'' said
Maria Lopez, 46, whose home near Tegucigalpa's international
airport disappeared without a trace in the flood waters.
	   Hundreds of thousands of people in Honduras and Nicaragua had
fled or lost their homes. Failing communications prevented
authorities from issuing damage estimates _ Honduras'
transportation ministry said almost all the country's roads had
been cut _ but banana producers said they had lost their entire
crop.
	   ``Superhuman efforts are under way to aid the flood victims,''
said Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse, after he traveled to
the city's international airport aboard a U.S. military aircraft
based at the nearby Palmerola airbase. The terminal is closed to
regular air traffic. Flores Facusse declared the city ``a disaster
zone.''
	   Honduran authorities asked the United Nations for aid in
assisting flood victims. Food and medicine were in particularly
short supply. ``The government does not have the capacity to help
all the victims,'' said Health Minister Marco Antonio Rosa.
	   At sea in the Caribbean, two U.S. Coast Guard C-130 planes
continued the search for a tourist schooner with 31 people that had
reported being rocked by then-Hurricane Mitch on Tuesday.
	   By late Saturday, Mitch's winds _ once near 180 mph (288 kph) _
had dropped to 35 mph (55 kph) and the storm was located about 75
miles (120 kms) south of Santa Rosa de Copan, Honduras, moving west
at 7 mph (11 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center reported.
	   Neighboring El Salvador _ where 30 people died in flash floods _
declared a state of emergency Saturday, as did Guatemala, where
nine people died when floodwaters swept away their homes. Mexico
reported one death from Mitch on Monday.
	   Police fanned out across Tegucigalpa to stem what National
Police Chief Col. Napoleon Flores Ponce said were hundreds of
people robbing stores in the capital. Police had orders to ``take
drastic action'' to stop the looting, he told a local radio
station.
	   With rainfall of 4 inches (10 cms) an hour at the height of the
storm, downed bridges, rampant rivers, toppled trees and mudslides
had isolated hundreds of communities where food, water and medicine
were in short supply.
	   In Tegucigalpa, thousands sought refuge in government shelters.
About 30,000 had been taken Friday to shelters in the nation's
second city, San Pedro Sula in the north.
	   The British Ministry of Defense said that it sent a Royal Navy
frigate based in the West Indies to Honduras Saturday to help in
assisting flood victims.
	   In small coastal communities near San Pedro Sula army troops and
fire fighters moved in with small boats to rescue people still
clinging to roof tops.
	   Clara Bonilla, a 31-year-old mother, spent the night in a school
bus near San Pedro Sula with her four children.
	   ``It got very cold in the night, and no one has given us much
help,'' Bonilla said as she clutched her youngest daughter.

Cameron's photographs capture female beauty
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Julia Margaret Cameron used a camera the way a
painter uses brushes and lighting.
	   Like Impressionist painter Pierre Auguste Renoir, Cameron
focused on a wide array of female models and captured a highly
edited slice of life _ the feminine beauty and behavior she saw
within each subject.
	   Cameron, who died in 1879 at age 63, is best known for her
portraits of male intellectuals like Charles Darwin, Robert
Browning and Alfred Tennyson, her neighbor on the Isle of Wight,
off the coast of England.
	   But it is Cameron's women who, for the first time, are the sole
focus of an exhibition. Sixty-five of these Victorian photographs
are on display through Jan. 10 at The Art Institute of Chicago in
an exhibition titled ``Julia Margaret Cameron's Women.''
	   The exhibition also will appear at the Museum of Modern Art in
New York City from Jan. 27-May 4, 1999, and at the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art from Aug. 27-Nov. 20, 1999.
	   Cameron's accomplishments are particularly impressive
considering she only took up photography at 48, when her daughter
gave her a camera. Her studio was a converted hen coop. She made
more than 2,000 photographic prints.
	   ``No one has ever captured the rays of the sun and used them as
you have,'' wrote Victor Hugo, who owned more than 25 of her
photographs. ``I throw myself at your feet.''
	   Unlike the men she photographed, Cameron's women were selected
for their beauty, not their intellectual accomplishments or class.
	   Her models were an eclectic group. Mary Ryan was her housemaid
and the daughter of a beggar. Julia Jackson was Cameron's niece, an
enigmatic beauty and the mother of author Virginia Woolf. Alice
Pleasance Liddell was best known as the little girl for whom Lewis
Carroll wrote ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.''
	   But always, Cameron focused her lens inside, expressing her
sometimes unconventional ideas of femininity.
	   It was ``the immortal within'' these women to which Cameron
responded, author Phyllis Rose writes in the catalog accompanying
the exhibition organized by Sylvia Wolf, associate curator of
photography at The Art Institute.
	   ``When she looked at a domestic servant with a mop and bucket,''
Rose writes, ``her imagination erased the mop and bucket, covered
the homespun clothing with swaths of drapery, and saw the woman as
the current exemplar of some timeless, enduring type'' _ a grieving
mother, for example.
	   Born in India and raised in France, Cameron spoke three
languages and was well read in theology, science and literature,
from the Bible to poetry to mythology. The titles and themes of her
photographs reflect her scholarship, devout Christianity and love
of children.
	   Cameron _ mother to 11 children, including five of her own, five
orphans and one foster child _ chose the Madonna image for dozens
of photographs. In ``Love,'' for example, Cameron's parlor maid is
wrapped in a shawl. She appears loving but tired and poor, perhaps
sad, as one little, bare-chested girl rests on her lap and another
sits beside her.
	   Cameron's women are a kaleidoscope of beauty, from the
alabaster-skinned Victorian ideal to unconventional images of less
polished, more daring types.
	   ``The Angel in the House'' has a flawless complexion and
lusciously thick hair. The portrait is named after a Coventry
Patmore poem about an ideal wife _ childlike, adoring, meek. It
shows the woman's softness _ her white fur collar and velvetlike
clothing.
	   But a far different image appears in ``The Mountain Nymph Sweet
Liberty,'' a title derived from John Milton's poem, ``L'Allegro.''
Here, Cameron's wide-eyed model looks tough and defiant. Her long
hair is disheveled; her complexion, ruddy; her clothes, sterner,
more masculine. She looks straight ahead.
	   ``Zoe, Maid of Athens'' depicts a modern, even sensual woman
resembling a 1990s crusader. She wears a hat resembling a kufi. She
looks at the camera with a sidelong come-hither glance.
	   And in ``Pomona'' the model looks directly at the camera, hand
on hip. With a saucy directness, ``She is definitely not a hothouse
flower,'' observed Wolf.
	   But all of Cameron's women have something in common. They do not
smile.
	   Instead, Wolf said, ``We see melancholy, we see defiance, we see
languor, sensuality, longing.''
	   Perhaps this somberness relates to the Victorian era, one of
hardship even for the well-to-do like Cameron, who at one time had
a manservant, a cook, a governess and three maids. Too often,
people died young. Cameron herself lost an infant son, and her only
daughter died in childbirth.
	   To convey intense emotions in her photography, Cameron used
light and movement _ something as simple as a model's breathing.
	   ``She was trying to get at something _ the soul,'' said Wolf.

Report: Japan's prime minister urges steps against missile threat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Sunday urged
heightened preparedness against missile attacks following North
Korea's launch of a rocket over Japan earlier this year, a news
report said.
	   Speaking to Japan Self-Defense Forces in Saitama, north of
Tokyo, Obuchi called for the creation of new Japanese defense
systems, saying the North's launch of a multi-stage projectile
endangered the region, Kyodo News reported.
	   ``We need to put in place the necessary systems so that we can
deal properly with a variety of situations,'' Obuchi was quoted as
saying.
	   Obuchi said Japan will ``continue to seriously study'' a joint
U.S.-Japan defense system that would intercept missiles before they
hit their targets, Kyodo reported.
	   Many legislators in Japan have also been calling on the
government to build a multipurpose spy satellite following the
North's launch.
	   North Korea insists its rocket-firing on Aug. 31 put a satellite
into orbit, but Japan refutes that claim, saying that the launch
probably aimed to test the range of ballistic missiles.

Featherweight champ Prince Naseem Hamed faces Irishman in title
</HEADLINE>
defense &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ WBO featherweight champion
Prince Naseem Hamed, the biggest mouth in boxing since Muhammad
Ali, put his title on the line Saturday in a 12-round showdown with
Irishman Wayne McCullough.
	   But to hear him tell it, the only question was how long it would
take him to send McCullough into premature retirement. All week,
the British-born Hamed (30-0) has predicted a knockout at 2:28 of
the third round.
	   A 5-1 favorite, he said would beat McCullough (22-1) so badly
that McCullough may never fight again.
	   On the undercard of the fight, which was televised by HBO, IBF
junior featherweight champion Vuyani Bungu of South Africa retained
his title with a 12-round majority decision over Danny Romero of
Albuquerque, N.M. Also, Marco Antonio Barrera took the WBO junior
featherweight title from champion Richie Wenton, stopping him in
the third round of a scheduled 12-rounder.
	   Hamed, 24, of Sheffield, England, promised an early finish to
the ``Fright Night'' card at Convention Hall.
	   ``I'm not taking a stopwatch into the ring, but I'll know when
it's time to end it. I'll get a cue from my corner that it's time
to shake and bake and then I'll hit him with a wicked right
uppercut,'' Hamed said.
	   In any event, Hamed is hoping for a better performance than in
his first fight in the United States. In that one, he was knocked
down three times by Kevin Kelley before scoring a fourth-round
knockout and keeping his unbeaten skein alive.
	   McCullough, 28, who is from Belfast, Northern Ireland but fights
out of Las Vegas, was a silver medalist in the Olympics in
Barcelona in 1992. His only defeat was a 12-round decision at the
hands of Daniel Zaragoza in January 1997.
	   He says Hamed is beatable.
	   ``I think he has a very weak chin. Kevin Kelley had him hurt but
didn't take advantage of it. Everyone says I don't hit very hard,
but Naseem will generate my power for me because he jumps into a
lot of punches. It will be like two trucks colliding,'' McCullough
said.
	   McCullough weighed in at 124 pounds (56 kilos), Hamed 125 pounds
(56.5 kilos). The class limit is 126 (27 kilos).

New sex charges against Malaysia's dissident leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The attorney general said new
charges of sexual misconduct would be leveled against Malaysia's
former deputy prime minister after his trial on 10 criminal counts,
news reports said Sunday.
	   Anwar Ibrahim faces 10 counts of corruption and sodomy, charges
he denies and says were politically motivated. His trial, likely to
be the most sensational in Malaysian history, begins Monday and is
expected to last through June.
	   Attorney General Mohtar Abdullah said new evidence had surfaced
against Anwar and a former tennis partner, S. Nallakarruppan, on
sex-related charges, the Star newspaper reported.
	   They ``will be charged after the conclusion of the existing
charges against them,'' the attorney general said. No further
details were given.
	   Anwar's trial begins with four counts of corruption expected to
be heard through November.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar as his deputy on
Sept. 2, saying his onetime heir apparent was unfit to lead.
	   Mohtar said the prosecution would carry out the case
professionally, without taking political sides.
	   ``Our responsibility is to enforce the country's laws by
conducting prosecution without fear or favor, based on clear
evidence,'' the attorney general said.
	   Mohtar said that trial dates for Anwar's remaining corruption
count and five sex counts had been fixed for dates in December,
February, March, April, May and June.
	   Raja Aziz Addruse, Anwar's head lawyer, said the defense counsel
had not yet been informed of those dates, the Star reported.
	   Anwar's case has become an international spectacle and is
expected to draw many foreign journalists, human rights activists,
diplomats and justice-system observers.
	   Most, however, are likely to be turned away. Chief Justice
Eusoff Chin said the courtroom chosen for Anwar's case would hold
50 people. No special treatment would be given to foreigner
observers, he was quoted as saying by the New Straits Times.
	   ``The moment I say you can sit but others cannot, can you
imagine what sort of complaints would come to me? We want to avoid
that,'' said Chin, adding that priority would be given to Anwar's
family, for whom 10 seats had been reserved.
	   In another setback to international coverage, Chin announced
Thursday that the trial would be held in the national Malay
language.
	   The decision reversed an earlier ruling by the High Court judge
presiding over Anwar's case, Augustine Paul, who had ordered that
the trial be held in English ``so that justice can be seen to be
done.''
	   Anwar's friend Nallakarruppan, known as Nalla, was arrested in
July under the harsh Internal Security Act, which allows jail
without trial. He is alleged to have had sexual trysts with Anwar.
Nalla has called the charges ``wild allegations'' against him and
Anwar ``without any foundation of truth.''
	   Anwar's case sparked International concerns when he appeared in
court with a black eye and body bruises, injuries he said were from
police beatings.

Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello: the musical odd couple?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY304 &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID BAUDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach sat in a hotel
lounge explaining why their musical partnership wasn't as odd as it
seemed. The usually voluble Costello did most of the talking.
	   Bacharach listened, and not just to his younger friend. He
smiled in recognition upon hearing the first few notes of one of
his songs, ``The Look of Love,'' quietly playing in the background.
	   He asked Costello _ maybe seriously, maybe as a subtly
competitive joke _ if he had arranged to pipe in the instrumental
version of Dusty Springfield's classic. Costello shot him a
sardonic smile. It wasn't the first time he'd been interrupted in
public by Bacharach's work.
	   ``It happens all the time,'' he said.
	   Costello wasn't expecting to hear ``Radio Radio'' at the
Regency. There's a better chance, someday, of hearing something
from ``Painted From Memory,'' the new collaboration between the
resurgent king of lounge music and the Brit who surfed the first
wave of punk rock in the 1970s.
	   They first worked together three years ago when filmmaker
Allison Anders asked them to pair for a song on the soundtrack to
``Grace of My Heart.'' They wrote ``God Give Me Strength'' by phone
and fax machine, coming face-to-face only to record.
	   Costello was so pleased he suggested a longer project, one in
which they could actually write together in the same room. The
result is a moody song cycle about lost love, with lush
orchestration, reminiscent of such Frank Sinatra albums as ``In the
Wee Small Hours.''
	   ``It's a pretty good theme for the both of us,'' Bacharach said.
``I've always been inclined to write romantic music, hopefully from
the heart. There are not a lot of up-tempo songs in my catalog.''
	   It takes a look beneath the surface to find their common ground.
Costello is an encyclopedia of musical knowledge who'll try
anything, from rock to country to classical, often to the detriment
of his career. He performed Bacharach's ``I Just Don't Know What To
Do With Myself'' in concert 20 years ago.
	   When he stood in a tuxedo performing before an orchestra in New
York City's Radio City Music Hall this month, Costello fulfilled a
dream that dates to his father's days leading a dance-hall band.
	   Many of Bacharach's songs go down easy, but Costello appreciates
the complex melodies and the way they can convey emotion even
without words. Bacharach may be popular in lounges, but that's not
how he defines himself.
	   ``If you want to put any label on it _ cocktail music or
easy-listening music _ I'm not going to be angry with that,'' he
said. ``I don't necessarily agree. I don't think `Anyone Who Had a
Heart' is easy listening.''
	   The pair worked hard to bridge musical differences and come up
with a true product of teamwork.
	   ``There was nothing to be gained in trying to prove the point
that we could make some sort of Frankenstein's monster out of the
most extreme edges,'' Costello said. ``The hybrid of `Pump It Up'
and `What's New, Pussycat' might seem like something of a road
crash.''
	   Costello was pleased when one critic wrote that a song was
``absolute Bacharach.'' He had written half of it, and he took the
critique as proof that he and Bacharach could speak in one voice.
	   ``It's also the work of two craftsmen, who know what we're doing
_ two people who are willing to explore and stick with something,
whether it's one note or one bar, and not let it go until we know
that it's right,'' Bacharach said.
	   The experience taught Costello a new economy in lyric writing.
Bacharach may look the epitome of California cool, but he would put
his foot down when Costello would return from a writing session and
try to cram a few extra syllables into a line.
	   Bacharach is a man who once got into a fierce argument when
writing ``That's What Friends Are For,'' insisting that the first
word in the song be ``and.'' It didn't really mean anything; he
just liked the sound of it. And he wouldn't let it go.
	   The discipline helped Costello, whose songs can be wordy and
dense. Costello also helped Bacharach, partly weaning him from
synthesizers to more organic instruments, like the bass flute that
opens ``In the Darkest Place.'' Costello said his aversion to
electronics comes from his ``Steely Dan phobia.''
	   The songs are particularly demanding for Costello as a vocalist,
even if he has worked noticeably to improve as a singer over the
past few years.
	   Sometimes, though, the songs are too demanding, especially when
performed live. In an odd way, Costello found this to be part of
their appeal. He was stunned during a tour of Italy earlier this
year when ``God Give Me Strength'' drew the loudest and longest
ovations he had ever received. People seemed to appreciate his
struggle.
	   ``Maybe people see this is a fallible vocalist,'' he said.
``This is somebody who's working at the very edge of my ability to
reach for something we've composed that is beautiful.''

	   SUZUKA, Japan (AP) _ With the Formula One championship on the
line, Michael Schumacher lost the poll position in Sunday's
season-ending Japanese Grand Prix with a false start.
	   Schumacher must win the race and needs his Finnish rival Mika

Life of Walt Disney digitally mapped on computer disk
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Walt Disney, the ultimate 20th-century man, left
us long before computers overwhelmed mass media, but it is only
fitting that the most comprehensive _ and loving _ tribute to the
quintessential innovator comes on CD-ROM.
	   Disney was perhaps the first to recognize and make serious use
of high technology's entertainment potential.
	   ``He really used it in its infancy, you know, for all the
animatronic figures, like Mr. Lincoln, who was in the World's Fair
in '64, and then at Disneyland,'' said Diane Disney Miller, Walt's
first-born.
	   ``There was a huge room that held all the computers, the stuff
that made Mr. Lincoln stand up and talk and sit down again. And now
it's condensed to such a small, little, amazing technology.''
	   ``Walt Disney: An Intimate History of the Man and His Magic''
(Disney Interactive, CD-ROM for Windows 95, dlrs 39.99) is a
storehouse of Disney's life and art, archived for easy retrieval on
the home desktop.
	   It's filled with cherished family mementos never before made
public, classic cartoon clips, behind-the-scenes anecdotes and
artifacts _ even home-movie footage Disney shot decades before
every American parent got into the act.
	   Introduced by Mrs. Miller, the disk is organized around a 3-D
gallery. It takes visitors through the animation and theme park
genius' life in well defined multimedia segments featuring photos,
voice-over narrative, documents and essays from Disney scholars.
	   From his birth in 1901, it travels through his childhood in the
Midwest to his early days in Hollywood founding Disney Studios with
brother Roy. It moves on to the studio's heyday of successes with
Mickey Mouse, and films like ``Snow White,'' ``Fantasia'' and
``Bambi.''
	   The story moves on to the brilliance of Disneyland and the
homespun warmth of ``The Wonderful World of Disney,'' where Disney
demonstrated his talent for family entertainment on television.
	   One of the Disney family's goals in creating the CD-ROM
biography was to present Walt Disney's private side, using real
footage to dispel negative stories that have surfaced since his
death in 1966 from lung cancer.
	   ``You see him with his family, you see him with friends, you get
a pretty good feel of the kind of guy he was,'' Mrs. Miller said
during a rare trip to New York. ``He's not this cold figure often
portrayed. He was very warm, and very silly.
	   ``If I were to write a book, I could never have a real objective
view of my Dad. And even if I worked very hard to do it that way
myself, no one would trust it because I'm the loving daughter. I
don't think we've hidden anything. I don't know what there is to
hide frankly, but everything that is available, as much as we could
squeeze onto the disk, is there.''
	   Disney's devotion to family wasn't just public relations palaver
staged to sell family entertainment. He lived the part, taking an
active role in every aspect of his children's lives.
	   ``It was very normal,'' Mrs. Miller said of Disney family life.
``He drove us to school every day until we were old enough to
drive. He loved doing it. His family was precious to him. He had
grown up in a close family. He was always strong, steady and
supportive.''
	   Still, he could be stern when it was called for.
	   ``Oh, yeah we got in trouble. We were little brats,'' Mrs.
Miller said. ``And my dad, although he was a very gentle man, was
no wimp. If he thought we were being impudent, or got out of line
somehow, he let us know.''
	   Disney will always be remembered for classic creations like
Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Disneyland and the conglomerate of today
that bears his name. But to his daughter, Disney's best qualities
were his traditional values and desire to better mankind through
entertainment.
	   ``And also, he wanted to be an educator,'' she said. ``He said
education should be exciting, it should never be boring. He
believed in people. He thought people were good, and that given
choices they'd make the right ones.''
	   Disney fans and doubters alike will derive something special
from ``Walt Disney: An Intimate History of the Man and His Magic.''
Except for clips and old animation cells of Disney's favorite
playful rodent, there's nothing Mickey Mouse about it.

Howard will meet with Mahathir says Downer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian prime minister John Howard
was expected to meet privately with Malaysian counterpart Mohamad
Mahathir at the APEC meeting this month, Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer said Sunday.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton will not pay Mahathir a customary
courtesy visit because of the arrest and trial of Malaysia's former
deputy leader Anwar Ibrahim, according to administration sources.
	   But Downer said Australia's government did not want the
controversy to harm the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting
of 21 nations.
	   Downer said Howard, along with many regional and other leaders,
had expressed concern about Ibrahim's treatment, and he expected
the issue to come up during talks between Howard and Mahathir.
	   ``I think it's important that the prime minister does meet with
Dr. Mahathir because after all Dr. Mahathir is chairing the APEC
summit,'' Downer told Australian television. ``We are placing a
very great deal of emphasis, indeed putting a great deal of effort
into this APEC meeting. We want the meeting to be a success,
whatever the domestic problems of Malaysia may be.''
	   Ibrahim is to go on trial Monday on charges of sodomy and
corruption. Downer ruled out any Australian observers attending the
trial.
	   ``Not only will we not have observers at his trial but the
Malaysians have made it clear they don't want any foreign observers
at the trial,'' Downer said.
	   ``We want to see him treated according to the principles of
natural justice and importantly to the rule of law. If these
charges can be proven, well, that's one thing, but there has to be
clearly a proper, impartial trial.''

Mayor: Death toll rises with mudslides in northwest Nicaragua

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Mudslides buried several communities
near Nicaragua's northwestern border with Honduras, killing at
least 58 people, according to a local mayor, and pushing up the
death toll from one of the strongest Caribbean hurricanes to at
least 450.
	   Only 57 of the 2,500 people living in 10 communities at the foot
of Caistas Volcano had been accounted for by Saturday evening,
Mayor Felicita Zeledon of Posoltega, about 20 miles (30 kilometers)
south of mudslide area, said in an interview with the government's
Radio Nicaragua.
	   Rescue workers had pulled 58 bodies from the mud, she said.
	   ``It is like a desert littered with buried bodies,'' Zeledon
said, citing reports from rescue workers.
	   Zeledon's report could not be independently confirmed, and it
wasn't clear exactly when the mud crashed down the side of the
volcano.
	   But it was the first official word of any mudslide deaths in the
northwestern province of Chinadega, where unconfirmed radio reports
had said as many as 4,000 people in the area may have been killed
when mud came crashing down the volcano.
	   Maj. Evenor Carcamo, head of the National Civil Defense System
in the region, said earlier Saturday that bad weather made it
impossible to fly to the area during the day to check out the
reports.
	   Gen. Joaquin Cuadra, head of the Nicaraguan army, added that the
Posoltega region ``is one of the places most affected, and we do
not have access by air or land.''
	   The official Nicaraguan casualty toll also included 121 who died
in the heavy rain and flash flooding. Nicaragua has asked the
United States to lend it helicopters to help deliver aid and assess
casualties and damage, Defense Minister Pedro J. Chamorro Barrios
said.
	   In Honduras, at least 231 people have been confirmed dead from
former Hurricane Mitch, the National Emergency Commission said
Saturday. With rainfall of 10 centimeters (4 inches) an hour at the
height of the storm, downed bridges, rampant rivers, toppled trees
and mudslides isolated hundreds of communities where food, water
and medicine were in short supply.
	   Army helicopters rescued some flood victims clinging to rooftops
in the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa. In small coastal communities
near San Pedro Sula, troops and firefighters moved in with boats to
rescue people still clinging to roofs.
	   Clara Bonilla, 31, spent the night in a school bus near the city
with her four children. ``It got very cold in the night, and no one
has given us much help,'' Bonilla said, clutching her youngest
daughter.
	   Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse, who traveled to
Tegucigalpa's international airport aboard a U.S. military
aircraft, said that ``Superhuman efforts are under way to aid the
flood victims.''
	   El Salvador _ where 30 people died in flash floods _ declared a
state of emergency Saturday, as did Guatemala, where nine people
died when floodwaters swept away their homes. Mexico reported one
death from Mitch on Monday.
	   In the Caribbean, two U.S. Coast Guard C-130 planes continued
the search for a tourist schooner with 31 people aboard that hasn't
been heard from since Tuesday.
	   Mitch _ once one of the strongest hurricanes to hit the
Caribbean _ was downgraded Saturday to a tropical depression status
but continued to dump heavy rain on the region. By late Saturday,
Mitch's winds _ once near 180 mph (290 kph) _ had dropped to 35 mph
(60 kph) and the storm was located about 75 miles (120 kilometers)
south of Santa Rosa de Copan, Honduras, moving west at 7 mph (11
kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center reported.
	   The Coast Guard reported that two Swiss citizens were rescued
from a life raft after their 33-foot (10-meter) yacht went down
Monday in the Caribbean, but there was still no sign of the
258-foot (80-meter) schooner, Fantome.
	   ``There's still not a lot we can do with the way the weather is
down there,'' said U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Jeff Hall.
	   The Antigua-registered Fantome, once owned by Aristotle Onassis,
is operated out of Miami by Windjammer Barefoot Cruises.
	   After dropping its tourist passengers off in Belize on Monday,
the crew headed toward Roatan Island, off the north coast, to
escape the hurricane _ which for two days was centered near that
island.
