<HEADLINE> Turkish Forces in Northern Iraq to Pursue PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Some 5,000 to 7,000 Turkish troops,
backed by helicopter gunships, crossed into northern Iraq early on
Sunday in an operation against rebels of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK), military sources said.
</P>
<P>
The troops pushed 10 kilometers into northern Iraq and clashed
with PKK rebels in several places.
</P>
<P>
The operation is apparently aimed at warning PKK not to regroup
its militants in the Turkish territory.
</P>
<P>
"It has been observed that many PKK groups have been moving
toward the Turkish border. Hence security forces launched the
operation this morning," said the military sources.
</P>
<P>
The operation ran in parallel with an action by some 10,000
Turkish troops sweeping the mountains near the Turkish towns of
Tunceli and Bingol in mid-eastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the forces in northern Iraq, up to 50,000 troops are
being deployed on the Turkish-Iraqi border, ready to take part in a
larger operation.
</P>
<P>
In response to a call issued by the imprisoned PKK leader
Abdullah Ocalan after being sentenced to death, PKK rebel forces
announced a ceasefire and reportedly retreated into bases in
northern Iraq in February.
</P>
<P>
But the Turkish military described the call as a ploy to win
time in order to stage a come-back.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 Gulf War, northern Iraq has been under practical
control by two rival Iraqi Kurdish factions independent of the
central Iraqi government. One of the factions has been fighting the
PKK alongside the Turkish army.
</P>
<P>
But each time the Turkish troops intruded into northern Iraq,
they were condemned by Baghdad as an encroachment upon the Iraqi
territory.

<HEADLINE> Blair Says No Rescue Plan for Rover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Sunday ruled out any chance of government intervention to help
save jobs threatened by BMW's break-up of Rover.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the Sunday Business newspaper, the prime minister
said governments in the past had been drawn towards "rescuing" a
company in difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"We see our role now as helping to equip people and businesses
for the new economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Help would include encouraging innovation and improving
education, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, BMW chairman Joachim Milberg said he warned the
government three months ago that Rover was in "serious trouble".
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Milberg said that by
late November 1999 he suspected the loss-making subsidiary was no
longer viable and was "extremely doubtful" about Rover's future.
</P>
<P>
Milberg said he rang Britain's Trade and Industry Secretary
Stephen Byers in late December and told him that Rover was "in
critical survival mode - in serious trouble".
</P>
<P>
But the Department of Trade and Industry disputes the contents
of the 22 December call.
</P>
<P>
BMW says it was made clear that Longbridge as a whole was under
threat.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday union leaders accused BMW of "betraying" Rover
workers at a rally of up to 80,000 protesters in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
The West Midlands is likely to be hardest hit by BMW's sale of
Rover - up to 4,000 jobs are expected to go at Birmingham's
Longbridge plant.

<HEADLINE> Racist Attacks in N.Ireland Draw Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The police said the attack on two Chinese men in south Belfast
on Sunday morning was racially motivated, the BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
Both men were chased and beaten by a gang near Delhi Street, in
the Ormeau Road area of the city. One of the men was taken to
hospital with a broken finger and a head wound.
</P>
<P>
Anna Manwah Watson of the Chinese Welfare Association said the
attack was not an isolated incident.
</P>
<P>
"In the last three months we have received reports from about
10 families from the Chinese community complaining about
harassment at their homes and restaurant, with people throwing
stones and causing trouble. To hear about this attack would
certainly scare the Chinese community even more," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to remind the community that the Chinese
community has been here for over 30 years. We have stood by the
wider community right through the Troubles. We have worked and
provided a very good service for the community whether it is in
Protestant or Catholic areas," the BBC quoted Anna as saying.
</P>
<P>
Alliance Party leader Sean Neeson condemned the attack as "
cowardly and very worrying".
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply concerned at the growing number of racially
motivated crimes in Northern Ireland and would ask for serious
consideration to be given to the introduction of Hates Crimes
Legislation here," he said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Mourns Murdered Cultists in Kanungu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Feng Jian
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Ugandans gathered in
Kanungu in southwestern part of the country Sunday afternoon to
mourn the over 920 victims of the cult Movement for the
Restoration of Ten Commandments of God.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony, presided over by Vice President Specioza Kazibwe,
was also attended by diplomats and ordinary foreigners.
</P>
<P>
In the key-note speech, Kazibwe urged religious leaders to
offer proper guidance to their followers. She described the
Kanungu incident, in which over 530 people were burnt to death in
a church fire on March 17, as a mass murder and the cult leaders
as "ruthless religious maniacs."
</P>
<P>
The cult was not an ordinary religious sect and its leaders
were clever but mentally sick extremists, she added.
</P>
<P>
Kazibwe said that the government is compiling the list of
victims and called on the relatives of victims to report to the
police.
</P>
<P>
On the cause of the incident, Kazibwe said that those who
failed to act properly to avoid the tragedy would also be
punished for their negligence.
</P>
<P>
"Uganda respects the freedom of worship, but the government is
not going to allow the freedom of worship stipulated in the
Constitution to be exploited and abused," the vice-president
said.
</P>
<P>
The nation observed this day as a special day of mourning for
the victims most of whom were innocent and murdered.
</P>
<P>
Before the ceremony, she visited the scene of the incident and
laid a wreath on the big tomb where hundreds of the cult victims
were buried.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Hopes OPEC Deal Helps Stabilize Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Sunday voiced hope
that the newly-reached agreement on increasing oil production of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will help
stabilize oil prices.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after its weekly session, the Kuwaiti
cabinet expressed hope that "the results of the agreement will help
achieve stability" in the interests of both oil producing and
consuming countries.
</P>
<P>
Oil ministers of OPEC's 11 members, including Kuwait, began a
meeting in Vienna on March 27 to decide on the output policy after
OPEC's one-year production cuts agreement expired on March 31.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's output squeeze policy had at first lifted the oil prices
from abyss, or a 10-year low of about eight U.S. dollars a barrel
at the beginning of 1999, and then pushed the prices to a nine-year
high of over 30 dollars last month.
</P>
<P>
On March 29, nine of the 11 ministers signed, following tough
discussion, an agreement to increase their output by 1.45 million
barrels per day starting Saturday, with an "aim to keep the oil
prices at reasonable levels."
</P>
<P>
Iran, which didn't sign the new deal along with Iraq, has also
reportedly agreed to increase its production.
</P>
<P>
OPEC also groups Algeria, Indonesia, Libya, Qatar, Nigeria,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Appreciates UAE Stance Against Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraq appreciates the call of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) for lifting the sanctions imposed on
Iraq since 1990, said Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan
while meeting a trade and industrial delegation from the UAE on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The UAE's stance is important for rebuilding the Arab unity,
said the vice president.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan stressed that the U.S., who has been leading military
aggressions against Iraq, is in desperate attempts to prolong the
decade-long sanctions aimed at causing damage not only to Iraq but
also to the whole Arab world.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Ramadan reaffirmed that Iraq gives priority
to Arab countries in developing trade relations, because it will
help the causes of Iraq as well as the Arab world, and strengthen
their struggle against Arab nations' enemies.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the Iraqi government, Iraq
signed more than half the contracts with Arab countries within the
framework of the U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. humanitarian deal, Iraq is allowed to sell a
certain amount of oil to import humanitarian supplies such as food
and medicine for its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under crippling U.N. sanctions ever since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, and the end of the sanctions is yet to be seen.
The U.S. has vehemently opposed the lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan has called for
lifting the trade embargo on Iraq, emphasizing the necessity of
ending the sufferings of the Iraqi people and restoring normal
relations among Arab nations.

<HEADLINE> Final Status Talks Make No Progress in Washington: PNA Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator to the
final-status talks Yasser Abd-Rabbo said the talks held in
Washington between March 21 and 28 failed to make substantial
progress.
</P>
<P>
The talks focused on three main issues, namely the land, the
refugees and the future relations between Palestine and Israel, he
told reporters here on Sunday
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israelis discussed the last stage of the
redeployment of Israeli troops but failed to make headway due to
Israel's refusal to define the borders of Jewish settlements,
Jerusalem and the Israeli military bases which represent a
prerequisite of charting the maps of the last redeployment, Abd-
Rabbo said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accord, Israel should withdraw its troops from
the Palestinian territories occupied during the 1967 Middle East
war except for the Jewish settlements, Jerusalem and the military
bases that could be dealt with in the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
So far Israel turned over the Gaza Strip wholly and 43 percent
of the West Bank to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) while
retaining security control over the Jewish settlements there.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday evening PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat said the
Washington talks were still in a preliminary stage, adding that the
talks did not discuss serious issues.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to hold further talks in Washington on
April 6.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Palestinians said on Sunday that
Arafat will meet U.S. President Bill Clinton late April in
Washington in a bid to push forward the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm El-Sheikh memorandum, the Palestinians and
Israelis are scheduled to reach a framework agreement by next May
as a prelude to signing a permanent peace treaty on September 13.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Ruling Party Expels Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lusaka, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's ruling Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy (MMD)announced here Sunday that its
Information and Publicity Secretary George Mwambazi and Lusaka
province Chairperson for Women's Affairs Rose Zimba have been
expelled from the party for alleged disobeying party regulations.
</P>
<P>
Several other MMD members have also been expelled for similar
reasons, Lusaka Province Minister Sonny Mulenga announced at a
press briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said Mwambazi and Zimba have been expelled from the party
following dark corner meetings they had been holding in support of
Environment and Natural Resources Minister Ben Mwila together with
some other party members who had also been campaigning for Mwila.
</P>
<P>
"At a Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) meeting held here
yesterday (Saturday), we decided that Mwambazi and Zimba be
expelled from the party because they had been holding dark corner
meetings," he said.
</P>
<P>
He categorically stated that MMD cadres in Lusaka province
would follow directions of the MMD National Executive Committee
(NEC) and would respect the decision of President Frederick
Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Mulenga meanwhile advised Mwila to form his own political party
if he wanted to be president.
</P>
<P>
Mwila, one of the country's richest with a business empire
spanning manufacturing, construction, finance and fertilizers,
helped Chiluba defeat former President Kenneth Kaunda in the
elections in 1991 and now is seen as a leading candidate to
replace his nephew in the next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
But Chiluba said in September last year that he would ensure
that his uncle Mwila does not become the country's president.
</P>
<P>
Recently Mwila has been accused of defying the party decision
not to start campaign at present stage.

<HEADLINE> Flood Leaves 70,000 Malawians Homeless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- At least 70,000 people have been
left homeless in Malawi by heavy torrential rains in the past
three weeks, Malawi's Department of Disaster Preparedness, Relief
and Rehabilitation, said Sunday in Blantyre.
</P>
<P>
The deluge has caused many rivers to burst banks, thereby
flooding hundreds of hectares of crops, most of which like the
staple food maize have already matured, according to the
department.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of mainly mud and grass thatched houses have
crumbled, it said. Bridges, especially an important one that links
the rice and tobacco growing central lakeshore districts of
Nkhotakota and Salima, have been washed away.
</P>
<P>
A clinic in the southern Nsanje district and a primary school
that was acting as a refugee camp in the southern district of
Chikwawa, were also flooded and medical drugs and school books in
the two premises were destroyed respectively.
</P>
<P>
At least five rivers in districts bordering Mozambique burst
their banks, while four in the north of the country are also under
water.
</P>
<P>
The department noted that in the northern border district of
Karonga, which hosts the Songwe, at least 10,000 homes were
flooded. In the central lakeshore district of Nkhotakota, the
count was pegged at 2,000 household farms which were washed away,
with 150 houses destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The department said the food situation of the displaced is
under threat as most of them depended on their flooded maize
plots.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defense Secretary Visits Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen arrived in Israel Sunday evening for a brief visit at the
start of his 12-day tour of the ten countries in the region, aimed
at boosting multilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A senior Israel defense official has said that one of Cohen's
objectives in the visit is to examine how to build a broader
security network to enable Middle East allies to collaborate to
counter joint threats like terrorism and possible biological and
chemical warfare.
</P>
<P>
Cohen is scheduled to hold talks Monday morning with Prime
Minister and Defense Minister Ehud Barak, before leaving Israel for
Jordan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, the two are expected to discuss military
cooperation between the two countries, the 17-billion-U.S.- dollar
U.S. defense assistance Israel wants to accompany any peace deal
with Syria, and other security issues concerning the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, in a speech to American-Turkish Council in
Washington, Cohen described the Middle East as a neighborhood where
terror is tangible and palpable and said much of the future
security of the region will depend on actions by Iraq and Iran.
</P>
<P>
This is Cohen's sixth tour of the region, which will also take
him to Nigeria, Qatar, Bahrain, kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates and Oman.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Underlines Expansion of Tehran- Sanaa Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
on Sunday called for further expansion and development of bilateral
relations between Iran and Yemen to serve the stability, progress
and security of the region.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Yemeni Information Minister Abdul
Rahman Muhammad al-Akwa, Khatami said that Iran and Yemen have
deeply-rooted historical ties and common interests.
</P>
<P>
He said, expressing hope that the exchange of visits between the
high ranking officials of the two countries would lead to further
expansion of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Describing Yemen's domestic and foreign policy as "prudent,"
Khatami praised Yemen for attaining unity both within and outside
the country, and supporting the Lebanese people and their movement
against the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
He termed the mutual agreements on information between the two
sides as "positive" and said that there is a very firm
determination in Iran to further consolidate and expand the
relations with Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni minister Lauded Khatami's viewpoints on issues of
dialog among civilizations.
</P>
<P>
Every vigilant and informed Muslim should follow the same plan
and way of thinking, he said, also underlining expansion of
cooperation in information between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister also brought a written message from Yemeni
President Ali Abdullah Saleh to Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that the upcoming visit by Saleh to Iran would be a
turning point in the relations between the two countries. But it is
not clear when Saleh will visit Iran.

<HEADLINE> Barak Reiterates Israel's Troop Withdrawal From South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
reiterated here Sunday that Israel will withdraw its troops from
south Lebanon by July this year with or without a peace agreement
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after his meeting with visiting Dutch Prime
Minister Willem Kok, Barak said he will not allow anyone to test
his intention for bringing the Israeli boys home from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Barak also reiterated that Israel expects the withdrawal from
south Lebanon to take place in the context of the U.N. Security
Council Resolution 425, which calls for the deployment of either
Lebanese government troops or the international forces in south
Lebanon after Israel's pullout.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli-Syrian peace talks, Barak said that although the
talks have been stalled since January this year, the door of peace
with Syria has not been closed.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister expressed the hope that Syria will return to
the negotiating table at an earlier date.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks entered a stalemate in January
after the two sides held two rounds of talks in the United States
due to Israel's refusal to promise to return to Syria the entire
Golan Heights, which Israel occupied during the 1967 Middle East
War.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton failed last Sunday in Geneva to
reach an agreement with his Syrian counterpart Hafez Al-Assad on
restarting the talks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Defense Minister Ghazi Zuetir suggested on Saturday
Lebanon might request Syria to send its troops to south Lebanon if
Israel withdraws its troops unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Ghazi's statement received strong rejection from the Israeli
side. Barak told the weekly cabinet meeting earlier on Sunday that
it is impractical for Syria to deploy its troops in south Lebanon
and Israel will never allow that to happen.
</P>
<P>
Kok is here for a two-day visit which will end on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Mandelson Warns N.Irish Unionists against Fresh Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Peter Mandelson warned pro-British Ulster Unionists on
Sunday against putting sticks in the wheels of progress if the
Irish Republican Army began to disarm.
</P>
<P>
Irish republicans needed to be assured that the main Protestant
party would not make fresh demands if the British province's
squabbling politicians succeeded in bridging a persistent impasse
over guerrilla weapons, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble has signaled he may be
willing to return to the power-sharing assembly without IRA
disarmament in return for a commitment it will hand in weapons.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson, speaking to Roman Catholic and Protestant teenagers
from both sides of the Irish border, said a failure to realize the
full promise of the 1998 Good Friday peace accord could rekindle
recriminations that fueled decades of conflict.

"We're in danger of recreating that vicious circle we thought

<P>
Mandelson said there was a sense of urgency to break the

<P>
But, with a week to go to the landmark pact's second

Mandelson warned that "sparks" of trouble could lead to a fresh

<HEADLINE> S. African Gov't Urged to Attract More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The South African Communist
Party (SACP) on Sunday stressed that the government should use the
budget to draw more foreign direct investment for infrastructure
development and job creation.
</P>
<P>
"Much needs to be done in order to attract the flows of foreign
direct investment," SACP's secretary-general Blade Nzimande told
South African Press Association after the party's central
committee meeting here.
</P>
<P>
He said the committee noticed that since mid 1996, the party
has been trying to attract substantial foreign investment through
a program of "self- imposed fiscal austerity".
</P>
<P>
"Whatever contribution the austerity program may have made to
stabilization, the foreign direct investment flows have been
disappointing, and financial liberalization has seen a net outflow
of capital," Nzimande said.
</P>
<P>
The SACP is planning to play a more active role in the
budgetary process.
</P>
<P>
Nzimande explained :"We will, within alliance (with African
National Congress), seek to shape budgetary priorities that are
more aligned with our vision of infrastructural development and
industrial policy programs as the key accelerator for growth, job
creation and development.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth requires an economically active government
which is capable and willing to plan, coordinate and discipline
the capital resources of the society, he emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Kaunda Reaffirms Retirement from Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambian former President and leader
of the biggest opposition party, the United National Independence
Party (UNIP), Kenneth Kaunda reaffirmed here Sunday his decision
to quit party politics.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, 76, told a press conference held in the
Intercontinental Hotel that he will not contest any position at
the UNIP National Congress to be held at the end of this month and
early May.
</P>
<P>
"I have made a firm decision and committment to retire from
active politics and devote more of my time to other pressing
concerns," he told hundreds of reporters and his supporters
crowding the hall.
</P>
<P>
He said the retirement decision is neither as abrupt nor as
sudden as it appears, adding that he had been carrying out wide
consultations both within and outside his party.
</P>
<P>
He had also carried out extensive consultations within and
outside the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda expressed his hope and confidence that UNIP will find a
suitable leadership among the many young people.
</P>
<P>
+I will be handing over power to the new leadership and
particularly to the new president of the United National
Independence Party willingly and confidently knowing that I will
always be there to support him or her to the fullest. Together we
will take this mighty party to higher heights,+ Kaunda said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that under no circumstance will he abandon the
party that he has led for more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
"I will always be available for consultations and whenever I
maybe requested I will always do everything possible to help," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda said even in retirement he will remain an ordinary but a
strong and active member of the UNIP.
</P>
<P>
He said "I will not interfere but I will help if need be."
</P>
<P>
He said that he will also never relinquish his responsibilities
to his country, adding that "I shall therefore not hesitate to
play my part in seeking for solutions to the problems that may
affect our people."
</P>
<P>
If necessary, he will take action against any injustice that
any government will perpetuate. That includes a UNIP government,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Almost a decade later the situation in the country is very much
worse than at the time he handed over power, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The levels of poverty are depressing and painful and the
massive numbers of once employed people who now have little
dignity has brought shame to us all," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the country's general elections to be held next year Kaunda
said he had been carrying out a series of consultations with other
opposition parties over the last few weeks. It was brought to his
attention that it might be easier for a united opposition, working
together to successfully emerge victorious at the elections.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda expressed his confidence that his party has gone through
over the last few years, it has regained its confidence.
</P>
<P>
Given a fair and level playing field, UNIP is capable of
electoral victory and it is possible for the party to form a
government once again, Kaunda said.
</P>
<P>
Last week Kaunda announced in South Africa that he will retire
from active politics.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda ruled Zambia after its independence from British
colonial rule in 1964 until 1991, when he was defeated by
incumbent President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 elections Kaunda was barred from contesting the
position because his Malawian parentage.
</P>
<P>
In that year a constitutional amendment was adopted to bar
those whose parents are foreign immigrants from contesting the
country's presidency.
</P>
<P>
However, Kaunda had vowed repeatedly to run for the presidency
in the next general elections despite the government utterance
that Kaunda is not qualified for it.
</P>
<P>
His rival Chiluba has repeatedly urged him to quit party
politics to be respected as founding father of the country like
Nyerere of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda resigned from UNIP soon after his party lost in the 1991
 elections but he returned to UNIP in 1994 and was elected UNIP
president in 1995.
</P>
<P>
On December 25 of 1997 three days after his return from
overseas trip Kaunda was arrested for his alleged involvement in
the coup attempt of October 28 of 1997.
</P>
<P>
On June 1, 1998, Kaunda was released and in return for the
release three days later Kaunda announced his retirement from
party politics.
</P>
<P>
However at the end of 1998 Kaunda vowed not to retire, saying
no body can prevent him from contesting the 2001 elections.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Vows to Bring Perpetrators of Nightclub Tragedy to Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 2 (Xinhua) --The South African government
would see to it that the perpetrators of a nightclub tragedy in
which 13 children died be brought to justice, Deputy President
Jacob Zuma said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Zuma addressed a memorial service in Chatsworth near Durban in
memory of the children who died in what has now become known as
"black Friday".
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people, mostly from the Chatsworth community,
attended the memorial service in support of the grieving
families.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, two young men allegedly acting on orders from
Sivanthan Chetty, 39, owner of the Silver Slipper nightclub in
Chatsworth, detonated the teargas canister inside the full and
apparently badly ventilated club where about 800 children were
celebrating the end of the school term.
</P>
<P>
In the panic and hysteria that followed the children stormed
down a narrow stairway and under the pressure a wall collapsed on
them.
</P>
<P>
Eleven children were trampled to death, one died on the way to
hospital, another later died in hospital from lung damage and some
150 were injured, a number of them critical.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said he would personally like to see justice taking its
course in this case.
</P>
<P>
"The judgement in this case must be an example for all," said
Zuma.
</P>
<P>
"From national government's side we would like to see that the
law is followed to the end to deal with the perpetrators of this
crime." he was quoted as saying by South African Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
He told the crowd the tragedy was a challenge to the whole
of South Africa and not only to Chatsworth to find out what was
wrong with society.
</P>
<P>
"Something has gone fundamentally wrong with our society, he
said, adding that "people worship money at all cost and they use
money for activities  that is not good for society."
</P>
<P>
Zuma said it was clear that the problem was with the adults
and not with the children who attended the club.
</P>
<P>
"We need to create appropriate forms of entertainment for
our children," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Be strong, be comforted...this tragedy is calling on all
of us to do something about our society... This tragedy must be
the last of its kind, " Zuma said.

<P>
DHAKA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- President of the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) Tadao Chino arrived here Sunday on a three-day visit to
sign the Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement with Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
This will be the formal beginning of ADB's new Poverty
Reduction Strategy with overriding focus on eradication of extreme
poverty from the Asian and Pacific region in partnership with
governments of its developing member countries.
</P>
<P>
All ADB loans and technical assistance will be expected to
contribute to the reduction of poverty and the projects and
programs will also be designed to accelerate pro-poor growth of
focus on poverty directly.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposed strategy, ADB will increase its
support for human capital development since such investments are
usually the most effective way of breaking the cycle of inter-
generational poverty.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Dhaka, the president will call on Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina and related ministers to exchange views on
the operational and policy matters of ADB in Bangladesh. He will
also hold talks with the private sector leaders at the Federation
of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Use Bio-Chip to Diagnose Early Cancer (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have made a major
breakthrough in diagnosing cancer in the early stages with the
help of a bio-chip which has been developed by a Chinese research
institute in northwestern Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Yan Xiaojun, director of the Gene Diagnosis Technical Research
Institute affiliated with the No. 4 Medical College of the Chinese
People's Liberation Army, told Xinhua that it is more efficient
and accurate to diagnose early cancer by using a bio-chip, which
is the size of a match box than by using other methods.
</P>
<P>
He said that at least 500 experiments are needed to diagnose
early-stage cancer in the traditional way, which is time- and
energy-consuming.
</P>
<P>
"But by using a bio-chip, 1,000 tests can be done at the same
time," Yan added.
</P>
<P>
By using this high-technology method, Yan said, stomach cancer
can be detected at an early stage and patients can get timely
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Stomach cancer is the second-biggest killer in the world,
following lung cancer, and the Number One killer in China compared
with other tumors.
</P>
<P>
Yan is now heading a team doing research on bio-chips for
diagnosing various kinds of tumors in the early stages.

<TEXT>
<P>
In addition, Yan revealed that his team is also experimenting
with a bio-chip which can tell whether a three-month-old fetus is
malformed or has a hereditary defect simply by testing a drop of
blood from the mother's finger.
</P>
<P>
The test costs only 200 yuan (about 24 US dollars), Yan said.
</P>
<P>
This new method could help greatly reduce the number of births
of deformed babies and improve the population, he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that of the 20 million new-born babies each
year in China, deformed babies and those with hereditary diseases
account for five per 10,000.
</P>
<P>
Yan also disclosed that his research institute has already
successfully developed eight kinds of bio-chips for diagnosing
stomach diseases, hepatitis and venereal diseases. The bio-chips
will be applied in clinical practice within half a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
It takes only five minutes for a bio-chip to diagnose hepatitis
virus, compared with two days by using the traditional test.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Xi'an Genelife Technology Co. Ltd, the Xi'an
Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics under the Chinese
Academy of Sciences and the No.4 Medical College of the Chinese
People's Liberation Army have jointly invested 100 million yuan (
about 12 million dollars) to develop bio-chips for medical
purposes.
</P>
<P>
A bio-chip industrial park is to be set up in the Xi'an High
and New Technology Development Zone, said Ma Qinrong, deputy
general director of the Xi'an Genelife Technology Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, construction of a state-level bio-chip application
engineering center is in preparation, Ma added.

<HEADLINE> Judge Named to Undertake Reformist Assassination Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Judiciary has appointed a
conservative judge Hussein Razqandi to probe into the assassination
attempt on the life of Saeed Hajjarian, a close reformist ally of
moderate President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Mohmoud
Hashemi and head of the Tehran Justice Department, the Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
An informed source at the judiciary told IRNA that Razqandi,
former head of the justice department of Varamin, a town south of
Tehran, would chair the Branch 33 of the Tehran Islamic Revolution
Court to deal with the case.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the source said that
Razqandi, holding a special notice, can look into all charges
against those being accused of involvement in the assassination
attempt.
</P>
<P>
The judicial inquiry into the case of agents involved in the
assassination incident are in their final stages, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, deputy chairman of Tehran Municipal Council, was shot
and severely wounded in front of the council building on March 12
as tensions ran high following the landslide victory of reformers
over their conservative opponents in February's sensitive
parliament elections.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, also managing director of the reformist daily Sobh-e
Emrouz (This Morning) and a former Intelligence Minister, played an
important role in reformers' victory in the elections, which
humiliated the powerful conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Intelligence Minister Ali Yunesi said last month that 10
people had been arrested in connection with the assassination
attempt. But he said that the assassins are not affiliated with any
group or guild or foreigners, and they had carried out the
assassination attempt on their own and out of personal feelings and
motivations.
</P>
<P>
However, widespread rumors believed that the assassination
attempt was a revenge against Hajjarian by the conservatives who
still dominate the country's most sensitive organs.
</P>
<P>
Some prominent reformist leaders said that the assassination
attempt was linked with certain institutions and vowed to find out
the "commanding headquarters of political assassinations."

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM Denies to Deploy Army in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Syrian Foreign Minister
Faruk Shareh Sunday denied the saying that Syria would pour into
south Lebanon after Israel's withdrawal, People's Voice radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Shareh has delivered a message from Syrian President Hafez Assad
to Lebanese President Emile Lahoud concerning "the latest
development in the region and result of Geneva summit" after his
arrival earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
On Lebanese Defense Minister Ghazi Zuetir's speech of inviting
Syrian troops into south Lebanon in the event of Israel's
unilateral pullout from south Lebanon, Shareh said this was
Zuetir's personal point of view, adding that the two countries
should speak in one voice or Israel will benefit from their
divergence.
</P>
<P>
Zuetir said Friday that his country would ask Syria to garrison
south Lebanon following Israel's withdrawal. Lebanese official
source later declared it was Zuetir's personal position.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-styled 15-kilometer-deep security zone
in 1985 in south Lebanon with a claimed aim of protecting its north
from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Last month Israeli cabinet passed Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
plan to pullout its troops from south Lebanon with or without
framework agreement with Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, stations some 350,000
troops in the country. The two countries have repeatedly reiterated
the simultaneity of two peace tracks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Damascus has been demanding that Israel commit to a full
withdrawal from the strategic Golan Plateau back to the borders
before June 4, 1967, while Israel has rejected the Syrian demands.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state is keen to maintain full control of access to
the Sea of Galilee, the main source of fresh water for Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Syrian peace talks had been frozen for four years before
they re-opened in the United States in December.
</P>
<P>
But the talks quickly collapsed over the Golan Heights, but both
sides have said the door remains open for further negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss is scheduled to visit
Damascus on Monday for further talks with Syrian leaders on the
peace process.

<HEADLINE> Africa Seeking Strategic Partnership With EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) said here
Sunday that African countries are looking for a
new and strategic partnership with Europe.
</P>
<P>
"The partnership should be able to help us
carry out economic reforms, including structural
adjustment, in the light of economic
globalization," Sigh Makhan, OAU assistant
secretary-general for Eastern Africa, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The OAU official made the remarks just before
the Africa-Europe foreign ministerial meeting,
which is to make final preparations for the first
Africa-Europe summit due on Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The summit, under the auspices of the OAU and
the European Union (EU), is expected to be
attended by heads of state and government, or
their representatives, of most of the 15 EU member
states and 53 African countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the ministerial meeting and the
forthcoming summit, Makhan said the African
countries want to discuss issues "of primary
concern to us," particularly economic issues and
debt issues.
</P>
<P>
African countries, with a total external debts
of over 350 billion U.S. dollars, are seeking debt
reduction or forgiveness, more financial aid and
investment from EU.
</P>
<P>
The African countries also want to discuss with
the rich EU countries removing trade barriers "so
that our products can have a broad market access
not only in Europe but elsewhere," he added.
</P>
<P>
Makhan hoped both African and EU countries,
many of which former colonial powers in Africa,
would make "integrated efforts" towards the unity,
security and stability of the war-and-poverty-
plagued African continent.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want a divided Africa. And this is
what we are telling our partners and they should
not do anything that will undermine our efforts to
integrate the continent," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Ministry Considers Granting Mossad Legal Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Justice Ministry is
considering giving Israel's secret intelligence service Mossad a
formal legal status, the ministry' spokesman disclosed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin is mulling the idea and doesn't
exclude the possibility of legalizing the role of Mossad, Israel
Radio quoted spokesman Amir Abramovitz as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Ha'aretz daily reported the possible role-changing
will include defining its aims, clarifying its criminal
responsibility and formalizing its methods of investigation.
</P>
<P>
Mossad, which is responsible for gathering intelligence outside
Israel and conducting "special operations" abroad, doesn't have a
specific and clear legal role right now, according to Abramovitz.
</P>
<P>
Mossad, led by a chief appointed by Israeli prime minister
directly, has unconventional operational methods and traditionally
acts independently.
</P>
<P>
The chief's name was permitted to appear in media only several
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Although Mossad is regarded as one of the most successful and
efficient intelligence agencies, its reputation had been tarnished
in recent years by a series of botched attacks.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, its agents used purloined Canadian passports in a
assassination attempt on an Islamic militant leader in Jordan,
whose failure led to a diplomatic dispute between Israel and Canada
and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
One year later, Mossad agent's name again emerged disgracefully
in front pages as their wiretapping of a "target" in Switzerland
was tracked down by their smart Swiss craft brother and were caught
on the spot.
</P>
<P>
Last year, an ex-Mossad intelligence official was also convicted
by an Israeli court for fabricating reports on Syria, a
professional scandal tarnishing Mossad's fame further.
</P>
<P>
Some observers has pointed out that Mossad's flawed structure
and undemocratic organizational frameworks are some of the main
reasons for the failures.
</P>
<P>
Thus, they believe the agency's possible role-changing is
another indication of the trend in the security-paramount country,
in which some once notoriously clandestine organizations are urged
to accustom to a more democratic and open society.
</P>
<P>
"If something is clear and everyone knows what are the borders
or the powers, what is right and what is wrong, where is the red
line and borders of the Shin Bet and the Mossad, it can help
clarify the situation," Abramovitz said.
</P>
<P>
The domestic Shin Bet, or the General Security Service, was
prohibited last year by Israel's Supreme Court from using physical
pressure, which once was a routine measure by the service to get
information from Palestinian detainees.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Knesset (Parliament) is considering formalizing the
role of the Shin Bet either, Abramovitz said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will
also declassify the Commands of the General Staff in several
months.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Radio, senior officials said the orders are
to be made public in order to bring more transparency to the army.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Prime Minister to Visit United States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina will visit the United States from April 4 to 10, Foreign
Secretary C.M. Shafi Sami announced here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing newsmen here, he said that at the invitation of the
President of the Harvard University Neil L. Rudenstin, Sheikh
Hasina will address a selected gathering in the Forum at the John
F.Kennedy School of Government on April 5 on the subject "Leading
a Country in Transition: Challenges and Opportunities."
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Randolph-Macon Woman's College at Lynchburg,
Virginia, has also selected Sheikh Hasina as the winner of the
Randolph-Macon Woman's College Pearl S. Buck Award for 1999.
</P>
<P>
The selection of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for the award is
"an acknowledgment of her vision and courage and for her
achievements in the political, economic and humanitarian spheres
which captures the spirit of the award and of the woman who
inspired it," Shafi Sami said.
</P>
<P>
Against the backdrop of the visit of U.S. President Clinton to
Bangladesh on March 20, the current visit of the prime minister
would be yet another opportunity to build on the favorable
impression that Americans have about Bangladesh today, Shafi Sami
said, adding that this would further strengthen the bilateral
relations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> New Bureau to Monitor Coal Mine Safety in Liaoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A special bureau has been set up
in northeast China's Liaoning Province to improve safety in local
coal mines.
</P>
<P>
As the first of its kind, the bureau will focus on enacting and
implementing regulations concerning safe mining operations, said
Yuan Zhenduo, head of the bureau, but will not interfere in the
daily management of mines.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is one of the country's major coal-production bases.
</P>
<P>
The bureau is to carry out thorough checks of installations,
machinery and materials in all the coal mines in the province. It
will also hold a series of training courses so as to raise the
safety awareness of mining personnel.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that similar bureaus will be established in the
other 18 coal-rich provinces in northeast, northwest and southwest
China.

SHANGHAI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China has greatly enhanced the
accuracy of detecting early-stage breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
A new method developed recently by the Shanghai Dongfang Breast
Disease Hospital uses digital positioning technology to detect
tumors with diameters less than 0.5 millimeters. The method also
makes it possible to remove tiny tumors with the probing needle.
</P>
<P>
In the early stage, some breast tumors are too small to be felt
by hand, and x-ray films cannot show the precise position of such
tumors.

SHANGHAI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A five-year-old girl attacked by
a tiger in a local wildlife park received 18,000 yuan (about 2,176
US dollars) in compensation here over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Wildlife Park accepted the ruling by a local court,
and agreed to pay Shen Zhengyu 8,000 yuan in medical,
transportation costs and 10,000 yuan as compensation for
psychological damage.

<P>
Shen was attacked by a tiger, which scratched her face when
visiting the wildlife park on November 16, 1999.
</P>
<P>
A bus driver was killed by another tiger in the park on the
following day. This incident is being dealt with in a separate
court case.
</P>
<P>
The park has beefed up its security precautions in the wake of
the two incidents.

<HEADLINE> Domestic, Foreign Wines to Face Off After WTO Entry (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and foreign brands of wine
are expected to engage in fierce competition following the country
's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of China's most authoritative news weekly, the
Outlook, predicts that the wine contest will be one of the hottest
to be staged in the world's potentially largest consumer market.
</P>
<P>
The first round of the wine competition began in 1996, and
lasted three years. Finally, domestic brand names such as Zhangyu,
Great Wall and Dynasty got the edge over their foreign rivals.
</P>
<P>
The April 3 issue of the journal relates that from late 1996
the popularity of dry red wines has quickly spread all over China.
At one time, the country boasted over 100 foreign brands of such
wines.
</P>
<P>
"But they didn't seem to realize the importance of the price
factor in their marketing in China," the magazine says. For
instance, a bottle of foreign red wine was usually priced at over
a 100 yuan (about 12 US dollars), and some at even over 1,000 yuan.
The high prices proved to a hurdle to their market expansion.
</P>
<P>
However, the fatal strike against foreign brands came not from
their high prices but from their quality, according to an article
in the Outlook.
</P>
<P>
For instance, a 1998 sampling of 40 domestic and foreign brands
showed that 20 of them were substandard, of which 17 were from
outside the country.
</P>
<P>
Another blow for the foreign brands came in 1999, when a
popular TV show asked a group of ordinary Chinese consumers to
compare domestic and foreign brands.

<HEADLINE> Domestic, Foreign Wines to Face Off After WTO Entry (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Without the brand names on the wine bottles, most of the
respondents indicated that they favored Chinese-made wines, which
they said had a more delicate taste.
</P>
<P>
A noted wine connoisseur noted at the time that few high-grade
foreign wines had entered China and that foreign wines would go
bad if they had not been properly stored during their months of
journey to China.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the domestic wine brands showed strong
competitiveness in both their quality and prices, the magazine
says.
</P>
<P>
High-quality Chinese brands emerged victorious from the three-
year contest. A national market survey done in June 1999 showed
that home-made brands occupied about 80 percent of the Chinese
market, with Zhangyu at 22.21 percent, Great Wall at 16.60 percent
and Dynasty at 12.18 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the magazine warns, after China enters the WTO the
real test will come for Chinese wines.

<HEADLINE> Barak Rejects Lebanese DM's Statement on Troop Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Defense Minister Ghazi
Zuetir's statement on Syrian troop deployment in south Lebanon
after Israeli troop withdrawal was "impractical," Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Barak told the weekly cabinet meeting that "Zuetir's statement
concerning Syrian troop deployment in south Lebanon reflects the
sense of distress over the prospects of Israel's withdrawal."
</P>
<P>
Barak also expressed pessimism about the possibility of
restarting the Israeli-Syrian peace talks as U.S. President Bill
Clinton failed to reach an agreement on this issue during his
meeting in Geneva last Sunday with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Israel will not allow Syria to deploy troops over its northern
border that threatens its unilateral withdrawal from south Lebanon,
Israeli military sources said earlier.
</P>
<P>
Any Syrian troop deployment over Israel's northern border would
be regarded by Israel as an infringement of the "red lines" between
Israeli and Syrian troops in Lebanon, the sources pointed out.
</P>
<P>
If Israel withdraws unilaterally from the security zone by
July, "this raises the possibility to the Lebanese government to
ask Syria to send its troops to the south with the Lebanese army,"
Zuetir was quoted as saying on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Zuetir said he wanted to make it clear that his statement was
just his personal opinion and not Lebanon's official policy,
adding "the aim of such a request is not to make Syria protect
Israeli northern borders, but to put Tel Aviv in the range of the
Syrian rockets."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Zuetir's statement, Danny Naveh, who heads the
Likud's reaction team, said Sunday that Israel must be tough and
must demand a total withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Syria, the major power broker in neighboring Lebanon, deploys
about 35,000 troops in the country as peace keepers.
</P>
<P>
Syria would at this stage sit on the sideline in Lebanon and
avoid a direct confrontation with Israel, Israeli Tourism Minister
Amnon Lipkin-Shahak said Sunday, adding that "were Syrians to sit
on the Lebanese border, this would create a whole new situation."
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said Saturday night that Zuetir's
statement reflects the tragedy of Lebanese-Syrian relations, and
that any new developments in south Lebanon after Israel's
withdrawal should be carefully monitored by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Chief of General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces Lt.Gen.
Shaul Mofaz briefed the cabinet Sunday on the situation in southern
Lebanon and on preparations under way for the July withdrawal which
has been approved by the cabinet last month.
</P>
<P>
Israel expects the withdrawal to be carried out in the context
of U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, which calls for the
deployment of either Lebanese or international forces on the
border.
</P>
<P>
Barak has said that if Israel is attacked from Lebanon after the
withdrawal, Israel will not hesitate to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with a
self-proclaimed purpose of protecting its northern border from
cross-border guerrilla attacks.

<HEADLINE> Portuguese FM Calls for Joint Efforts to Solve African Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Portugal's Foreign Minister Jaime
Gama on Sunday called for joint efforts by the European Union (EU)
and African countries to deal with the social and economic problems
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Tackling environment, AIDS, poverty and a number of other social
affairs "is a common responsibility, we must address those issues
in cooperation," Gama told reporters after a meeting by the foreign
ministers of the 15 EU members, which preceded a joint Africa-
Europe foreign ministerial meeting Sunday noon.
</P>
<P>
"And that is the reason why we are searching for a Euro-African
strategic partnership, which is being created in this (upcoming)
first Africa-Europe summit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of African and EU countries will meet here on Monday and
Tuesday to discuss economic, political and social issues in Africa
and bilateral cooperation in these fields. The joint foreign
ministerial meeting was to lay the final touches for the upcoming
summit.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the differences over the subjects between the EU
and Africa, Gama said "we are working very intensively (to bridge
the gap) for several months. This (summit) meeting has also been
prepared for several months. And now we are at foreign ministers'
level. We are preparing the last paragraphs where we were not
agreeing, moving to an effective agreement."
</P>
<P>
While the EU countries see the summit as a political event to
discuss conflict prevention, human rights issues, good governance,
fighting against corruption in Africa, the African countries are
equally determined to put emphasis on the critically key issues of
trade, investment, debts and aid.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of promising to cut or write off Africa's
heavy burden of debts by EU countries, Gama said "we have announced
that, for the most poor countries, we have a strategy of debt
relief which is sound and will be addressed in the appropriate
framework of the international financial institutions."
</P>
<P>
"Also, we have targets for alleviating Africa's poverty and
contributing to their efforts in close cooperation with the African
states. We are working seriously upon that," he added.
</P>
<P>
The debt problem is not only an African problem, it is also
important for international trade and economy and Europe, too,
because it is crucial and effective for the world economy to
resolve the issue, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The total external debts of African countries, where about 44
percent of the population, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, live
well below the poverty line, amounted to 350 billion U.S. dollars.

RIYADH, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Saudi government has launched a
nationwide campaign to confiscate 15 kinds of Thai tuna products
believed to contain the genetically-engineering processed soybeans,
which are banned worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The move came three weeks after the government embargoed the
imports and sell of those tuna products contaminated by the
soybeans which may cause malfunction of genes of the consumers.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Al-ektissadiya on Sunday quoted market sources as
saying that more than 70 percent of tuna sold in the Saudi markets
come from Thailand, which is regarded as the world's biggest tuna
exporter.
</P>
<P>
An official at the Saudi Ministry of Commerce expected that
millions of packages of tuna will be confiscated due to a large
stock of tuna during this period.

<P>
RIYADH, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Doctors at the Riyadh-based Hamady
hospital performed a rare esophagoscopy operation on a four-year-
old child, the first of its kind in the Gulf and the Middle East,
the Al-ektissadiya daily reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, which did not say when the operation
was performed, the child was suffering from malfunction of the hole
from which esophagus enters abdomen, causing the return of a part
of the stomach to the chest.
</P>
<P>
The 90-minute operation, performed within the context of the
hospital's training medical course of esophagoscopy surgery for
children, was followed by another small operation at the bottom of
the child's stomach. Both operations proved to be successful.
</P>
<P>
Doctors repaired the affected part by making small holes in the
abdomen whose lengths ranged from 0.5 to 1 millimeter.
</P>
<P>
The patient left the hospital the next day, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Brushes Off Coup Rumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
Sunday brushed aside coup rumors and said that the military is
solidly behind him.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Cebu before leaving for
Manila following a four-day visit to Eastern and Central Visayas,
Estrada said that the speculations of a coup over this weekend
were a figment of the imagination of his political foes.
</P>
<P>
"You can ask major commands of the military if they ever think
of having a coup. It's only imaginary, a figment of the
imagination of those people who lost in the last elections," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also said that former President Corazon Aquino has
assured him of her cooperation with his administration.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he does not believe "Mrs. Aquino is behind a
supposed Silent Protest Movement against the administration."
</P>
<P>
"I was with President Aquino yesterday afternoon. We heard mass
together, and she assured me of her cooperation and help in (my)
undertakings," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada told his followers to refrain from being engaged in a
battle of stickers to counter the criticism of his detractors.
</P>
<P>
Personalities linked to the Aquino administration have been
reportedly carrying out a sticker campaign against the Estrada
administration.
</P>
<P>
Calling their movement the "Silent Protest," they placed
stickers (with an exclamation mark) on vehicles and other property
to show their opposition to the president.
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to do with that. Maybe some of our followers
are just answering those stickers. But I told them to stop it. We
should not give any importance to stickers," the president said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, one local newspaper said that right wing soldiers
were planning a coup over this weekend to overthrow the Estrada
government. But the rumor was dismissed by government and military
officials.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Opposes Eritrea's Proposal to Establish Flight Information Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has opposed Eritrea's
recent proposal to establish its flight information region (FIR)
and to amend Africa Indian Ocean Air Navigation Plan, the
Ministry of Transport and Communications said.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency Sunday quoted a statement by the
ministry as saying that Ethiopia rejected Asmara's proposal
because it was a threat to the air space management and flight
security of the Red Sea area flight zone.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia also objected Eritrea's proposal to amend the
Africa-Indian Ocean Air Navigation Plan taking into consideration
technical, operational, legal and aviation security reasons, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia believes that Eritrea's FIR could be established only
in accordance with the International Civil Aviation Convention
that restricts Asmara's FIR to its air space, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting held in Montreal, Canada, on March 8, 2000, the
Council of International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
decided that Eritrea's FIR would come into effect after a
technical discussion that considers the current Ethio-Eritrean
border dispute.

SHANGHAI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- While drawing an increasing
amount of overseas capital, Shanghai, China's leading industrial
and commercial city, is now drafting a new plan to promote
investment in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the municipal government say the city will
encourage local enterprises to set up subsidiaries abroad.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, entrepreneurs from Shanghai have
already established 545 businesses in some 70 countries, with a
total investment of 427 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
China has been promoting investment abroad since 1998 as part
of its effort to improve the economy.
</P>
<P>
Many local governments have taken steps to help businesspeople
transfer their production lines to foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Province in east China has just issued a series of
preferential policies for promoting investment overseas, including
easy loans and tax refunds for exported equipment and raw
materials.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Encourages "Tree Funerals" to Save Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- To protect cropland against
encroachment by graves, the Civil Affairs Bureau of this
Municipality in southwest China has been encouraging local people
to adopt "tree funerals", that is, to bury the ashes of their
loved ones and plant trees on them.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Guangming, an official with the bureau, said that to bury
the ashes of the deceased under trees or lawns will not only help
to save farmland, but also help to beautify the environment.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the deceased only need to pay 500 yuan as a
management fee. They can choose whether to bury the ashes of their
loved ones under trees or under lawns. The departments in charge
of memorial parks will determine what kind of trees will be
planted.
</P>
<P>
Memorial trees will be owned by the relatives of the deceased
for 20 years, Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
Already, 300 families have used this method to pay their
respects to their loved ones, according to Zeng.
</P>
<P>
"Tree funerals" are new concepts for Chinese people, who
traditionally prefer interment in coffins with large tomb mounds
erected over them, Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has a population of 31 million, and about 200,000
people pass away each year. If all the deceased were to be buried,
the municipality would have to set aside more than 133 hectares of
farmland every year, Zeng said. He pointed out that the city's
current amount of cultivated land stands at 2.25 million hectares,
much lower than the national level.
</P>
<P>
China's first funeral reform came in 1956, when the late
Chairman Mao Zedong and 150 other central and provincial
government officials agreed to cremation.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A campaign was launched today in
this east China metropolis, with the aim of educating its
residents in the importance of protecting wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Jointly sponsored by several organizations, including the
Shanghai Municipal Wildlife Conservation Association and the
international Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), the campaign
sprang from a proposal by eight scientists and a local student-
sponsored wildlife protection club, calling on the 13 million
residents of Shanghai to combat the practice of killing and eating
protected species.
</P>
<P>
Poaching and trading in wild animals are still rampant
worldwide, despite intensified efforts by the international
community to ban such activities, according to an official from
the WCS, who added that trading in wildlife has become rampant in
recent years, becoming the third-largest illegal trade next to
drugs and weapons.
</P>
<P>
China is faced with a grim challenge in protecting its wildlife,
since it has to protect 156 endangered species from extinction,
out of over 640 endangered species internationally, noted
biologist Yang Xiongli said.
</P>
<P>
"Every animal species represents a unique gene bank of
immeasurable value," Yang said. He also expressed his outrage at
the widespread practice in China of eating rare species of animals
such as swans and peacocks.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai alone, about 1,000 tons of snakes are eaten
annually, he said.
</P>
<P>
The campaign for wildlife protection is expected to last eight
months, highlighted by various forms of public education
activities, competitions and exhibitions.

Jia ordered local public security departments to make fire
prevention their top priority, and carry out detailed
investigations into the causes of fires.
</P>
<P>
People held responsible for fires must be strictly punished, Jia
said, adding that the departments concerned should also improve

prevention, and strengthen control and supervision of personnel in
charge of fighting fires and preventing their occurrence.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Enact New Bill on Securities, Futures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region will exact new regulations on securities and
futures, said a senior official today.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong needs a modern regulatory framework for the
securities and futures market to enhance its competitiveness as an
international financial center and the prime capital formation
center for the mainland, said Rafael Hui, Secretary for Financial
Services, at the launching ceremony for a three-month consultation
drive on the Securities and Futures Bill.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from consolidating ten existing ordinances, we have
introduced new measures in the Bill to simplify certain regulatory
arrangements to reduce compliance burden, close existing
regulatory gaps in order to promote market confidence, enhance
investor protection, reduce market misconduct and systemic risks,
and facilitate innovation and competition," Hui said.
</P>
<P>
Major new regulatory measures include the introduction of a
single license for market intermediaries to streamline regulatory
arrangements and bring in new licensing requirements to enhance
protection of clients' assets and the establishment of a civil
Market Misconduct Tribunal and expanding the existing criminal
route to combat market misconduct.
</P>
<P>
The disclosure regime for more timely dissemination of price-
sensitive information will be modernized to enable investors to
make better informed decisions, and the new bill will help
investors seek compensation by creating specific private causes of
action against market misconduct and false disclosure of
information.
</P>
<P>
A flexible framework for the regulation of automated trading

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Disappointed With Congo Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
has expressed disappointment with the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) on the continued violations of the Lusaka Peace
agreement signed last July.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba was speaking at the Lusaka International Airport on
Sunday shortly before his departure to Cairo, Egypt, where he is
scheduled to attend a two-day European-African summit.
</P>
<P>
He observed that when signatories concerned met at the Security
Council of the United Nations in January this year, they all
re-affirmed their commitment to the Lusaka Peace process.
</P>
<P>
He added that another meeting was convened in Lusaka for all
parties concerned to reaffirm their commitment shortly after the
Security Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
The President however observed that there were factors which
could have led to violations of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Firstly we expected the observer team from the U.N. to be in
immediately."
</P>
<P>
"Their absence to me creates a vacuum and people take advantage
of this."
</P>
<P>
But one also has to understand that the observer team is not
armed and they wanted to be sure that there would be security and
they would be allowed access both by the government and to whoever
holds territory in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The President said all parties involved in the peace process
were eager to see peace return to that country adding that they
would not give up.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that signatories come back to realization
since nobody had the capacity to continue in the war.
</P>
<P>
"We need money for development and not fighting. I only hope
signatories will come back to realization," he said.
</P>
<P>
And commenting on the two-day European-African summit, Chiluba
said details on the new relationship would emerge later.
</P>
<P>
He observed that there had been such a relationship which had
been going on for sometime but added that this seemed to be
entering a new phase where Europe and Africa wished to establish
stronger ties both economically and politically.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Olympic tourists from all over
the world might face another danger during their tour of the
Sydney Games -- dangerous surf at beaches.
</P>
<P>
A total of 305 people drowned in Australia in the 12 months
from July 1998 to June 1999, according to figures from the Royal
Life Saving Society of Australia.
</P>
<P>
Surf Life Saving Australia (SLSA) national medical officer
Peter Fenner said a fifth of people drowned in Australia were
tourists who died within four days of arrival at the country.
</P>
<P>
Fenner said SLSA had failed to encourage airlines to screen
multilingual videos warning visitors of the dangers of the surf.
He held that hotels at beaches should employ lifeguards and more
beach patrols should be paid.
</P>
<P>
The largest single cause of drowning nationwide was rips, or
strong currents, which drag people out to sea. Even many of the
competitors from 38 countries and regions at recent the life-
saving world championships at Manly beach cannot identify a the
dangerous surf, Fenner added.

at all levels.
</P>

The NPC chairman stressed that the local people's congresses
need to work in a creative manner in line with local social and
economic realities to boost local economies through effective
legislation.
</P>
<P>
The work of the people's congresses should be based on active

and Taiwan will get to know more about China's splendid history as
well as the achievements scored in the reform and opening up after
traveling in different parts of the mainland, thus strengthening
their sense of patriotism.

what we are telling our partners and they should
not do anything that will undermine our efforts to
integrate the continent," he noted.

for the Africa-Europe summit due on Monday and Tuesday, adding that
Europe is Africa's prime partner despite the fact that there are
some differences in the views of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that in the new century and the new millennium, we
start a dialog that rests on cooperation and views equally the
interests of the two sides," he said.
</P>
<P>
Africa has its apprehensions regarding the issue of debts, he
said. If the issue of African debts was not seriously settled,
efforts of the continent to effect economic and political reforms
will be futile, he stresses.
</P>
<P>
The combined external debts of African countries have reached
350 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 93 percent of the whole
African gross domestic product and severely hindering the
development of the continent.
</P>
<P>
On the issues of democratization and human rights which are
always raised by Europe, he said that Africa has adopted one
stance in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM in Beirut for Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh
arrived here Sunday morning to deliver a message from Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad to Lebanese leaders, the People's Voice
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Syrian news agency SANA reported Saturday that the message dealt
with "the latest development in the region and the peace process".
</P>
<P>
Israel is preparing to withdrawal its troops from south Lebanon
by July though the Geneva summit between al-Assad and U.S.
President Bill Clinton last Sunday failed to bring Syria and Israel
back to negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Defense Minister Ghazi Zuetir said on Friday his
country would ask Syria, the major power broker of Lebanon, to send
troops to south Lebanon after Israel's unilateral withdrawal from
its self-styled security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, Lebanese officials said it was Zuetir's personal point
of view.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-proclaimed 15-kilometer-deep security
zone in 1985 in south Lebanon with a claimed aim of protecting its
northern border from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Last month Israeli cabinet approved Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
plan to pullout its troops from south Lebanon with or without a
peace agreement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which stations some 35,000 troops in Lebanon,
have insisted on the simultaneity of their peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Damascus has been demanding that Israel commit to a full
withdrawal from the strategic Golan Heights it captured from Syria
in the 1967 Mideast war back to the June 4, 1967 border lines,
while Israel has rejected the Syrian demands.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state is keen to maintain full control of access to
the Sea of Galilee, the main source of fresh water for Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which resumed last December in
Washington after a four-year hiatus, were suspended in January
after two rounds of talks in the U.S. failed to solve the thorny
issue of the fate of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
However, both sides have said the door is still open for further
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss is scheduled to visit
Damascus on Sunday for further talks with Syria on the peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Israel not to Allow Northern Border Under Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel will not allow any foreign
troop deployment over its northern border that threatens its
unilateral withdrawal from south Lebanon, Israeli military sources
said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Any foreign troop deployment over Israel's northern border would
be regarded by Israel as an infringement of the "red lines" between
Israeli and Syrian troops in Lebanon, the sources told Israel
Radio.
</P>
<P>
The military sources made these remarks while commenting on the
Lebanese Defense Minister Ghazi Zaiter's statement on Saturday that
Beirut may ask Syrian troops to deploy in south Lebanon after
Israel's pullout there.
</P>
<P>
If israel withdraws unilaterally from the security zone, "this
raises the possibility to the Lebanese government to ask Syria to
send its troops to the south with the Lebanese army," Zaiter was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zaiter said he wanted to make it clear that his statement is
just his personal opinion and not Lebanon's official policy,
adding "the aim of such a request is not to make Syria protect
Israeli northern borders, but to put Tel Aviv in the range of the
Syrian rockets."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Zaiter's statement, Danny Naveh, who heads the
Likud's reaction team, said Sunday that Israel must be tough and
must demand a total withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Syria would at this stage sit on the sideline in Lebanon and
avoid a direct confrontation with Israel, Tourism Minister Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak said Sunday, adding that "were Syrians to sit on the
Lebanese border, this would create a whole new situation."
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said Saturday night that Zaiter's
statement reflects the tragedy of Lebanese-Syrian relations, and
that any new developments in southern Lebanon after Israel's
withdrawal should be carefully monitored by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Chief of General Staff of the Israel Defense Force Lt-Gen. Shaul
Mofaz is to brief the cabinet Sunday on the situation in southern
Lebanon and on preparations under way for the July withdrawal which
has been approved by the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Israel expects the withdrawal to take place in the context of U.
N. Security Council Resolution 425, which calls for the deployment
of either Lebanese or international forces on the border.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has said that if Israel is attacked
from Lebanon after the withdrawal, Israel will not hesitate to
retaliate.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with a
self-proclaimed purpose of protecting its northern security.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Arafat to Meet in Washington Later This Month: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will hold a summit meeting later
this month in Washington, the Voice of Palestine radio reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which the U.S. proposed to be held on April 26, will
discuss the outcome of an upcoming session of the Palestinian-
Israeli talks slated for Thursday and ways of boosting ties between
the U.S. and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Thursday's session will be followed by a new round of talks
should the two sides reach an agreement on all issues related to
the last stage of Israeli troops redeployment in the West Bank and
the final status, Hassan Abdel Rahman, the Palestine Liberation
Organization's envoy to Washington was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
After the Syrian-U.S. summit, recently held in Geneva, failed to
set the stalled Syrian-Israeli negotiations in motion, the U.S.
administration said it plans to exert more efforts very soon to
push forward the Palestinian track so as to enable the two sides to
reach a final peace treaty by the September deadline.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have set a May deadline to draft a
framework agreement on the thorny issues, including the fate of
Jerusalem, the return of Palestinian refugees, borders and water
issues, in order to reach a final peace treaty by September.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Clinton had met in Washington in January to nudge
Israel and the Palestinians to reach a framework agreement on
final-status issues before the February 13 deadline under the Sharm
el Sheikh Memorandum signed last September.
</P>
<P>
The two sides failed to meet the February deadline due to
differences over the areas to be transferred to the Palestinians in
the third stage redeployment.

<P>
ANKARA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel on Saturday began to talk
with deputies following the disappointing result in the first round
of voting on the constitutional amendment package for his second
term in office.
</P>
<P>
Demirel postponed all his visits scheduled for April and began
to woo deputies in favor of the package during the second round of
voting slated for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen said on Saturday that
Turkey's partnership with U.S. in implementing the 223-billion-U.S.
- dollar attack plane project will contribute to peace and
stability in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 19th annual Turkish-American Council meeting in

<P>

and democracy in India, saying that "Turkey showed to the whole
world that Islam can exist together with modernism and secularism.
''
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said ''It is sad that democracy was interrupted in
Pakistan,'' but adding that he will visit Pakistan in the coming
months.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Spots New Cases of Vesicular Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Sunday began to take
measures to prevent the spread of vesicular disease among
livestock in Hongsong County, South Chungchong Province as scores
of heads of cattle and pigs there were found infected with the
disease.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has banned exit of
people, vehicles and livestock from the infected areas in Hongsong
and slaughtered 58 heads of cattle and 35 pigs within 500 meter
radius from a farm where the cases were spotted.
</P>
<P>
The disease, which causes blisters on the mouth and hoof of
livestock, was first discovered last Monday and killed dozens of
livestock in Paju, Kyonggi Province in the country.
</P>
<P>
The ministry ruled out the possibility that the vesicular
disease in Hongsong was contaminated by the cases in Paju, saying
that the cases were found in Hongsong almost concurrently with
those in Paju, which was declared by the South Korean government
as quasi-disaster area last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the livestock in Paju which had blisters in feet, cattle
and pigs in Hongsong did not have blisters in their feet.
</P>
<P>
Japan and China's Taiwan have suspended import of livestock and
meat from South Korea while the United States and Australia halted
import of dairy products from the country although the vesicular
disease is harmless to humans.
</P>
<P>
Kim Ok-kyoung, director of South Korean Quarantine Department,
said Sunday the analysis of the blisters, viruses, blood serum and
saliva from the dead livestock showed the disease is an O-type
epidemic on livestock's mouth and hoof which swept Taiwan one year
ago.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the epidemic was found in the Korean
peninsula after 1934. Enidtem

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 2,(Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen is expected to arrive in
Israel Sunday evening at the start of his 12-day, 10-nation tour of
the Middle East region, aimed at boosting multilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A senior defense official told reporters on Friday that one of
the objectives is to examine how to build a "broader security
network" to enable Middle Eastern allies to collaborate to counter
joint threats like terrorism and possible biological or chemical
warfare.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Russian Atomic Power Minister Yevgeny Adamov said Friday that
Russia is finalizing contracts for constructing eight nuclear
reactors in India and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Russia's collaboration with Iran in this field has raised fears
in the West of the proliferation of sensitive nuclear technology.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government has repeatedly rejected charges by the U.
S. and Israel that it has been helping Iran develop a nuclear
weapons program.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Lebanese Defense Minister Ghazi Zaiter said Saturday that
Lebanon might ask Syria to deploy its troops in the south of his
country in case of a unilateral Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of such a request is not to make Syria protect Israeli
northern borders, but to put Tel Aviv in the range of Syrian
rockets, " he said. Syria has had some 35,000 troops in Lebanon
since 1976.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Police expect to make recommendations to the state attorney
this week from the criminal investigations of President Ezer
Weizman and Transportation Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, police head
Yehuda Wilk said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Weizman is suspected of receiving illicit cash gifts from
millionaire Edouard Saroussi and Mordechai has been charged of
sexually assaulting a staffer in his office.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Channel 2's Meet the Press show, Wilk said "the
investigation has been completed and we will hand over our findings
to the state attorney this week".

<P>
BANGKOK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive General
Pervez Musharraf arrived here Sunday for a two-day official visit
as part of his Southeast Asia tour.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Musharraf is expected to meet Thai Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai to discuss the promotion of bilateral
economic ties including trade and investment and cooperation in
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pakistani Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar and Commerce
Minister Razzaq Daud will hold separate meetings with their Thai

Pitsuwan would raise issues such as tension in South Asia,
bilateral trade and human resources development during his meeting
with Sattar.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is the last leg of Musharraf's eight-day, five-nation
tour, which has taken him to Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and
Brunei.
</P>
<P>
Officials said Musharraf's Southeast Asia tour is aimed at
boosting ties with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (
ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN made Pakistan a "sectoral" dialogue partner in 1993
and three years later gave the country's long-time rival India "
full" dialogue partnership.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Assures Tanzania of No New Refugee Flow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
assured Tanzania that the political adjustments occurring in the
country would not result into any major disorder that might
reactivate the flow of refugees to Tanzania, media here reported
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the situation in Rwanda following the resignation of
 President Pasteur Bizimungu, the Rwandan Ambassador to Tanzania
Zephyr Mutanguha stressed in Dar es Salaam on Saturday the recent
changes would not lead to any kind of conflict and there was
nothing to fear as the changes were supported by a majority of
Rwanda citizens, political parties, and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
The recent changes in Rwanda have not caused instability as
feared by many people, the Rwandan envoy was quoted as saying by
the Sunday Observer newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda was determined to build a strong and stable political
and economical structure. This is what it has learned from long
experience of the recurring conflicts in the country, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu resigned from power about a fortnight ago, leaving
behind an atmosphere of uncertainty following his strong
allegations against the parliament and the government before his
abrupt resignation.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador said Bizimungu's resignation was a new chapter
in Rwandan history, as it marked the first time that a serving
president had left office without any blood being shed.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there was a legal and democratic process in
place in his country to ensure that the interim period was
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the move toward electing a new president
within 30 days after the resignation was already under way as the
ruling party, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), was expected to
meet almost immediately to nominate presidential candidates who
would later be forwarded to the parliament for sanctioning.
</P>
<P>
Triggered by a bloody civil war which broke out in April 1994,
an estimated 170,000 Rwandan refugees entered the neighboring
Tanzania within 48 hours on April 28 and 29 of 1994, making the
biggest refugee influx never before witnessed in the history of
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are around 7,600 Rwandan refugees staying in
Tanzania's northwestern Kigoma and Kagera refugee camps
established by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.

<HEADLINE> Defense Pact Between Nigeria And United States Ruled Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Visiting United States Secretary of
Defense, William Cohen, Saturday ruled out the possibility of a
defense pact between his country and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
But he said in Nigeria's capital Abuja after meeting with
President Olusegun Obasanjo and Defense Minister, Lt.-Gen.
Theophilus Danjuma, that the United States is to spend 10 million
U.S. dollars on the Nigerian military establishment to make it
thoroughly professional.
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary's pronouncement has put to rest reports
that Nigeria was angling for a defense cooperation agreement with
the United States, the Guardian newspaper reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Some legislators at the National Assembly had earlier moved a
motion for a U.S-Nigeria military pact as the only way to keep
ambitious soldiers from usurping power and safeguard the country's
nascent democracy, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at a press conference, Cohen said the idea
of a military pact was not on the agenda of his visit, stressing
that the only way to forestall coups is to have "strict civilian
control over the military".
</P>
<P>
According to him, the essence of his delegation's presence in
Nigeria is to strengthen existing military ties, consolidate on
military reforms and to "sustain the bond of democracy in
Nigeria."
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. will assist Nigeria in its peace-keeping
effort in Africa "because we recognize Nigeria as an important
country in Africa considering the leadership role she has been
playing in various dimensions."

<HEADLINE> CAFA Denies Endorsement of South Africa's 2006 World Cup Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of African
Football Association (CAFA) has srongly denied reports that the
continental organization has endoresed South Africa's bid to host
the 2006 World Cup Finals, local newspaper Sunday Times reported
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An angry CAFA and FIFA executive member, Ismael Bhamjee, said
that no decisin has been made on who CAFA will endorse in Africa
and CAFA President Issa Hayatou was annoyed with the reports in
the South African media that he has told the Moroccan king Morocco
"had no chance" of hosting the great sporting event.
</P>
<P>
"I spoke with Hayatou soon after he had read the story, and he
was very upset. He wanted to know how he wound possibly have gone
into the king's palace and told him his country had no chance in
the 2006 race-- it would be an insult," Bhamjee said.
</P>
<P>
The false reports cound actually jeopardize South Africa's bid
rather than aid it and local journalists should follow basic
principles and check their facts before they write stories,
Bhamjee stressed.

<HEADLINE> Suspects Responsible for Cinema Fire Detained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Police in Jiaozuo City in
central China's Henan Province have detained more than 12 suspects
who are held responsible for a fire that broke out on March 29 and
killed 74 people.
</P>
<P>
Detained by the police were the boss of the video parlor Han
Benyu, 11 employees of the video parlor and Zhao Suxia, a public
security official in charge of the fire safety matters in the
district where the video parlor is located.
</P>
<P>
The police said the fire was caused by an overheated quartz
heater in the Tiantang video parlor, or Heaven video parlor in
English.
</P>
<P>
Investigations show that the video parlor lacks necessary fire
control facilities and has been opened without approval from the
local fire control authorities.
</P>
<P>
The predecessor of the video parlor is a food store under the
city's vegetables and foodstuff company, which was in 1998
contracted to Han Benyu and transformed into a video parlor with
two video halls and 28 VIP entertainment rooms.
</P>
<P>
The police said the bodies of the fire victims are so severely
burnt that only 16 of them have been identified by their relatives
so far. Related departments are still working to help the
relatives of other victims identify the rest of the bodies.

<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The first nuclear fuel element
plant in China broke ground Saturday in Baotou City in north China
's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region which is expected to provide
fuel elements for a nuclear power station in east China.
</P>
<P>
Two more heavy-water reactors are under construction in
Qingshan in east China's Zhejiang Province now with an installed
generating capacity of 700,000 kilowatts each.
</P>
<P>
The two heavy-water reactors are expected to first use imported
nuclear fuel elements provided by the Canadian government, which
will then be replaced by China-made nuclear fuel elements starting
from 2003.
</P>
<P>
The new nuclear fuel elements plant is of great political and
strategic importance since it will ensure stable fuel elements
supply for the country's nuclear power stations, according to an
official with the China Nuclear Industrial Group.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear fuel element plant is expected to go into trial
production in September 2001, and start to provide fuel elements
for Qingshan Nuclear Power Station in March 2003.
</P>
<P>
With a projected investment of 200 million yuan, the plant is
designed to produce 200 tons of nuclear fuel elements annually.

<HEADLINE> Report: Estrada Asked Not to Go on Long Foreign Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
has been advised against going on long overseas trips in the face
of a spreading opposition movement and rumors of a possible coup
attempt,Philippine Daily Inquirer said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted presidential palace sources as saying
presidential advisers are concerned over President Estrada's
scheduled state visits to foreign countries, including Britain and
France, because of the emergence of the so-called "Silent Protest"
Movement seeking his eventual ouster.
</P>
<P>
The advisers also said Estrada's domestic travels are also
going to be "minimized" because of recent intelligence reports
about an alleged assassination attempt, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
However, the military said Saturday that rumors of a weekend
coup against Estrada were the "biggest April Fool's Day joke," and
that rumor mongers could be charged.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado also dismissed the rumors as
coffee-shop talk.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Manila Standard newspaper reported Sunday that
the military has placed under tight surveillance four persons,
including two newspaper columnists, allegedly for fanning rumors
of a coup over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Although it brushed off the coup rumors, the military has been
placed on red alert since last week and security at military camps
and other strategic targets have been strengthened, the Philippine
Star newspaper said Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Sell Textiles Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading textile
producer, has decided to sell its textiles online.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has just established a special e-commerce company,
Longtou Zhangjiang Commercial Network Company Limited, with an
initial investment of 10 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Raw materials such as cotton and chemical fiber will be also
available via the Net.
</P>
<P>
Going online is part of Shanghai's effort to make the textile
industry highly profitable again after its major restructuring
over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
China's textile industry was over-staffed and inefficient. A
three-year reform program began in 1998 to help the industry
become profitable.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, outdated machinery and equipment including
10 million of China's 46 million spindles in cotton mills are
expected to be scrapped to cut down production capacity and
increase efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has closed 185 cotton mills and reduced its number of
spindles from 2.5 million to less than one million.
</P>
<P>
Last year Shanghai reported 15.8 billion yuan in textile sales,
with profits amounting to about 200 million yuan.

January 14 at the fourth plenary session of the Chinese Communist
Party (CPC) Central Commission for Discipline Inspection front-
paged today's People's Daily, in which Jiang elaborated on party-
building work of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called on the whole Party to fully recognize the great
significance of party-building under the current new circumstances,
firmly implement the principles of party-building and establish an
easy-to-implement and effective supervisory system to ensure
efficient party-building.
</P>
<P>

leaders Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing
and Li Lanqing Saturday joined about two million Beijing residents
and People's Liberation Army soldiers and officers in an annual

Xinhua Daily Telegraph
</P>
<P>
-- China reported surging export and import of machinery and
electronics products during the first two months this year, with
the total trade turnover hitting 25.3 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The export turnover and import turnover broke even at 12.65
billion US dollars respectively during the two-month period,
increasing by 45.6 percent and 43.3 percent over the same 1999
period.
</P>

become the world's leading textile and garment producer since it
produces 20 billion garments annually and ranks first in terms of
production capacity of cotton, wool, silk, garments and polyester.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also indicated that China is also the world's
biggest exporter of textile products and garments: it registered a
record-high export turnover of 45.6 billion US dollars in 1997;

inadequate to provide enough funds to meet social security needs.

<P>
-- The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) is trying to
help raise western Chinese people's awareness of market economy as
a way to support the Chinese government's "going west" development

To orient local people to learn about and manage a market
economy, the UNDP has launched a series of projects to train
village cadres and rural enterprise managers, and county as well

<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China's judicial authorities are
taking the initiative in strengthening the protection of
intellectual property rights (IPRs) on Chinese websites, the
weekend edition of the China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
"With the fast evolution of China's Internet industry, we
should turn to laws and regulations to ensure the healthy
development of the industry," the Business Weekly quoted Jiang
Zhipei, deputy chief justice of the Intellectual Property Right
Chamber of the Supreme People's Court, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Because of the weak awareness of IPR protection in the
cyberworld, on-line copyright infringements may become more and
more rampant, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Last December, two Chinese websites -- Beijing MyWeb and
Guangzhou Tekson were sued for illegally providing services that
enabled its Internet surfers to download International Federation
of the Phonographic Industry (IEPI) members' music recordings in
MP3 format through hyperlinks and search engines.

<P>
This first lawsuit against on-line music piracy was settled
after the two sides reached an agreement which was approved by the
Beijing No 2 Intermediate People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, MyWeb admitted that it has violated the
IEPI members' copyrights, paid compensation to the four member
companies and eliminated its hyperlinks to unauthorized MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement in the case demonstrated increasing awareness of
copyright protection for websites," said Wang Yandong, chief
representative of the IEPI's Beijing Office.
</P>
<P>
IEPI's case against Tekson, however, has yet to be adjudicated,
according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the agreement approved by the court
indicates that China is on the right track to protect the property
rights on websites by intensifying its effort to regulate and
standardize the Internet as well as enhancing people's awareness
about on-line IPR protection.
</P>
<P>
But the nation's efforts to check cyberworld piracy are far
from being satisfactory and more effort is needed to wipe out on-
line piracy, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, China should urgently develop laws and regulations
protecting IPRs in various areas before it enters the World Trade
Organization, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Currency Savings up in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Foreign currency savings deposits
from Shanghai residents rose to a record high of 1.96 billion U.S.
dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
This has brought the total of personal foreign currency savings
deposits in the city to 8.38 billion U.S. dollars. The amount
accounts for 60 percent of the entire foreign currency deposits in
all Chinese banks in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China,
the country's central bank, said personal foreign currency savings
deposits have become a major source of foreign currency credit
funds in the city.
</P>
<P>
The growth in private foreign currency savings deposits is
attributed to China's increasing international exchanges. Improved
living standards and the higher interest rate of foreign currency
deposits are also major causes for the rapid rise in foreign
currency savings deposits.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict that private foreign currency savings deposits
will increase as Shanghai continues to develop internationally.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-based Du Pont Company
will continue to expand its market share in China this year and
build businesses in China into its production base in the Asia-
Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Optimistic About Meeting IMF Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
confident of its ability to meet a new deadline set by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) for completing key economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic the ministries responsible for the
implementation of the 42 items will complete their tasks right on
time," Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry
Kwik Kian Gie said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the government must complete the
implementation of some 42 key economic measures as a prerequisite
for the disbursement of 400 million U.S. dollars in bailout funds
from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate on these 42 economic measures, but said
they particularly focus on bank and corporate restructuring
programs.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government signed a letter of intent with the
IMF on January 20, in which it promised to complete a host of
ambitious economic measures by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
But many of the key programs were not completed by the deadline,
prompting the IMF to delay the disbursement of the 400 million
dollars, which had been scheduled for April 4.
</P>
<P>
The money is part of a 5 billion dollars loan package promised
in January by the IMF to finance the country's economic reform
programs.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, President Abdurrahman Wahid forbade his ministers
to travel overseas until they reach an agreement with the IMF on a
new deadline.
</P>
<P>
Minister Gie said the IMF is now expected to disburse part of
the loan in May.
</P>
<P>
He added that the delay in the disbursement of the IMF money
has no significant impact on the government's finances, but
stressed that the completion of the economic reforms is crucial to
reviving confidence in the ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
"Our balance of payment is adequate for the next six months,"
he was quoted by The Jakarta Post Sunday as saying.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Levy New Tax for Social Security Purpose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to levy a new
tax to raise funds for increased spending on social security, the
business weekly of China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Despite debates within related ministries including the State
Development Planning Commission, the State Administration of
Taxation and the Ministry of Labor and Social Security,
authorities have pushed the decision through because existing
mechanisms are inadequate to provide sufficient funds to meet
social security needs, including the needs of those expected to be
laid off from the State-owned enterprises this year, insiders said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese enterprises have yet to pay 38 billion yuan (4.6
billion US dollars) in overdue pension payments under the current
system, statistics from the Ministry of Labor and Social Security
indicated.
</P>
<P>
The shortfall, economists said, poses a threat to the normal
operations of the social security system.
</P>
<P>
"The decision has been made, although it is still controversial,
" and details of the new social security tax have yet to be worked
out, the Business Weekly quoted a source with the Ministry of
Labor and Social Security as saying.
</P>
<P>
Controversies over such a new tax have been focusing on whether
the proposed tax should replace existing fund-collection
mechanisms or simply supplement them. Disputes also exist as to
whether the social security system, as social insurance, should be
limited to medical care, unemployment or retirement coverage, or
be expanded to cover losses in other areas such as those resulting
from natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
It would be much easier to enact a new tax to supplement funds
from the existing fee-collection system for social security needs
rather than to replace them, insiders said.
</P>
<P>
Ji Jinbiao, associate professor with the Central University of
Finance and Economics, said, "Taxation is the most effective way
to raise necessary funds for social security programs."
</P>
<P>
He added that a levy of a social security tax could give strong
legal support to fund raising, make collections constant, unified
and uniform across the country and in diverse entities.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, proceeds from the tax could be better
protected from misappropriation because such funds will be used
with supervision from fiscal departments and accounting agencies,
Ji said.

<HEADLINE> "Condensed Water" First Found in Taklimakan Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have found that
there exists "condensed water" in the Taklimakan Desert of the
northwest Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Scientists Wang Hong, Li Fenglin from the Geology and Minerals
Institute of Tianjin made the discovery when they were exploring
waters in the dry land.
</P>
<P>
Also called "suspended water", the "condensed water" is
believed to come into shape when evaporated water from the water-
able aquifer meets cold air at the ground surface of the desert.
</P>
<P>
Geologists first put out the theory in the mid 20th century
that there exist natural "condensed water". However, it has not
been proved until now.
</P>
<P>
The two scientists found the "condensed water" at two sites
around the place named "Tazhong".
</P>
<P>
One site was located at the halfway of a small sand dune. The
water at the site disappeared two days later together with the wet
sand.
</P>
<P>
About half a month later, they discovered another site in the
middle of a sand dune a wet 2.5-meter-long, one-meter-wide wet
sand belt.
</P>
<P>
The Taklimakan Desert has long been nicknamed as the "dead sea"
where no plant or grass can exist.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of "condensed water" in the desert has proved
that there exists water in the shallow underground of the desert.
</P>
<P>
"This will bring much benefits to the future development of the
desert," Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Suffers Capital Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Capital flight from Venezuela last
year reached 4.6 billion U.S. dollars, the Economic and Financial
Counseling Office (OAEF) said in a report released on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The advisory body, which is affiliated to the congress of the
country, said the exit of capital conforms to the dynamics between
the rates of interest on banking documents in bolivars, the
country's currency, the rates of interest paid by deposits abroad,
and the money depreciation expected.
</P>
<P>
The relation between these variables has encouraged the exit of
capital in search of bigger profits.
</P>
<P>
It said that the lack of a consistent economic program of
medium and long term, together with the lack of incentives to
private investments, generates doubts about the sustainability of
an eventual growth powered by public funds.
</P>
<P>
"These factors have affected the confidence of investors, who
used their capital to seek hard currency, and if the trend
continues unchecked, the flight of capital will go on during the
year 2000," it noted.
</P>
<P>
The flight of capital occurs despite the extraordinary growth
of 19 percent in the value of oil exports compared to 1998 and a
drop of imports of 21 percent from 1998 to 1999, it added.
</P>
<P>
Foreign reserves closed at 16 billion dollars this weekend, a
drop of 94 million dollars as against the same period of the
previous year, it said.

<HEADLINE> Secrete Tunnel Found in Colombian Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Colombian authorities Saturday
uncovered a 70-meter-long clandestine tunnel in the La Modelo
prison of Bogota which could be used for a mass escape.
</P>
<P>
The yard where the digging of the tunnel was started was shared
by the offenders from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (
FARC), the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels, as well as
common criminals, said the prison head warden, Lieutenant Reynaldo
Fierro.
</P>
<P>
The interns included people accused of the assassination of
former presidential candidate for the Conservative Party Alvaro
Gomez Hurtado and those who killed journalist and humorist Jaime
Garzon, added Fierro.
</P>
<P>
Others were the alleged perpetrators of the attack against
lawyer Antonio Cansicon who defended former president Ernesto
Samper during the scandal about the supposed contribution of drug
money to his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
Fierro said he couldn't attribute the building of the tunnel to
anyone else or any other groups jailed in the yard of the prison
housing some 1,200 inmates.
</P>
<P>
The authorities, who seized charts of the prison and compasses,
said that the tunnel started in an empty cell and ended in a sewer
close to the Attorney General Office in the west of the city.
</P>
<P>
Police and army forces surrounded the prison to prevent
possible unrest after the discovery of the tunnel.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Ethnic Indians Protest Government Petroleum Permit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- About 1,200 Indians of the Uwa
community of Colombia occupied Cubara in the Andea region of
Boyaca to demand the government cancel the license granted to
Occidental Petroleum (Oxy) to explore the area adjacent to the
Indian settlement, the ethnic group said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Uwa spokesman Fabio Tegria said that it is "a peaceful
occupation of undefined duration" to protest the government's
granting to the multinational Oxy an environmental permit to
explore the Samore block next to the Uwa reservation in Boyaca.
</P>
<P>
The occupation, which aimed to force the oil company to leave
the region, some 250 kilometers northeast of Bogota, occurred
despite a judge's order to suspend the exploration in reply to a
demand filed by the aboriginal community to reclaim its
fundamental rights.
</P>
<P>
The Uwa opposes oil exploitation because their beliefs consider
crude as the blood of the earth.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Colombian Oil Company (Ecopetrol) chairman Alberto
Calderon Zuleta said that the Samore bloc has reserves close to
three billion barrels and its exploitation is indispensable to
maintain crude production and avoid imports.
</P>
<P>
Calderon said although the oil enterprise respects the judicial
decision, it will appeal.

BOGOTA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Two soldiers and a rebel woman were
killed Saturday in fighting in Colombia's northeast Santander
department, military authorities said.
</P>
<P>
A corporal was injured and four rebels captured Saturday when

motorcycles, two automobiles and food rations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Carreno said the fighting also involved guerrillas of the
National Liberation Army (ELN), the second biggest insurgent force
in Colombia. The dead rebel woman was an ELN member.
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) is the

</P>
<P>
Nearly 30 Chinese and foreign educators gathered in Beijing
from March 27 to 31 to discuss reforming the teaching of science
and technology at primary and secondary levels, as well as child
development in the new century.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, co-sponsored by the Ministry of Education, the

 MOE to Increase Assistance to University Students
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education recently worked out a plan to
increase subsidies to university and college students from poor
families to discourage them from dropping out of school, according
to a national education work conference held on March 28 in Xi'an,
Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of last year, almost 10,000 students from 54
schools, in eight pilot cities, had signed agreements on borrowing
student loans, totaling 400 million yuan.

<P>
A huge lake recently reappeared near the "Mountain of Flames"

The lake, 10 kilometers long and three km in width, was filled

below the sea level, the world's second-lowest lake after the Dead
Sea in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The lake is a rebirth of Aiding Lake, which dried up a decade
ago as the result of evaporation and excessive use of water in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"The reappearance of the lake can be attributed to more
flooding than in normal years, replenishment of 100 million cubic
meters of underground water, and, more importantly, popularization
of water-saving techniques in developing agriculture over the past
years," said Bai Jianjun, director of Turpan City Bureau of Water
Resources.

China's Giant Pandas Waiting to Be Adopted
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed recently between the China
Wildlife Conservation Association (CWCA) and the twinbays.com, an
America-based e-commerce website, China will start from April 1 to
raise funds on line to protect giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
Five giant pandas from the Wolong Nature Reserve in southwest
China's Sichuan Province will be adopted under the fund-raising
program, said CWCA secretary-general Wang Fuxing.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time that China goes on line to raise
funds for the protection of wildlife, he said.

Use of Tiger Parts to Cure Disease Endangering Tigers
</P>
<P>
The tradition to make medicine with tiger parts including the
bones remains a leading threat to tigers, according to a report
released Thursday by TRAFFIC, a wild animal protection
organization.
</P>
<P>
The trade in tiger skins and curios is also threatening the
existence of the big cats, with a population of no more than 8,000
across the world.
</P>
<P>
Tiger-bone medicines and tonics have been used as a treatment
for rheumatism and related ailments for thousands of years in Asia
and people will try to obtain them, even at some risk, said the
report by the Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna in
Commerce (TRAFFIC).
</P>
<P>
The report, titled Far From A Cure: The Tiger Trade Revisited,
warned that the fight to save the tiger risks being lost if
conservationists become complacent with the advances made in the
1990s towards reducing use of tiger bone in traditional Asian
medicine.

China will launch its third national giant panda survey
starting in April, said Ma Fu, deputy director of the State
Forestry Administration.
</P>
<P>
The survey will determine the number of giant pandas living in
the wild, in zoos and their habitats. This information will
facilitate setting up a giant panda monitoring system and
information management system, said Ma.
</P>
<P>
The survey will include 55 counties in southwest China's
Sichuan Province and northwestern Shaanxi and Gansu provinces,
covering an area of more than 22 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that only 1,000 giant pandas survive in the
mountainous regions of Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. To
protect the endangered animal, China has set up 33 nature reserves,
covering a total area of 1.6 million hectares.

 Grain-for-Green Project Takes off in West China
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has started a 1.9-billion-yuan grain-for-
green project in China's western region.
</P>
<P>
China has unveiled a detailed plan of grain aid to the western
region.
</P>
<P>
According to a notice issued by the State Forestry
Administration, the State Development Planning Commission and the
Ministry of Finance, farmers in the west will receive subsidies in
the form of grain after they turn cultivated land into forest and
pasture.
</P>
<P>
The project will turn more than 340,000 hectares of cultivated
land back to forest and more than 430,000 hectares of bare
mountains and lands in western China.

 Chongqing to Invest More in Liquid Sewage Treatment
</P>
<P>
This municipality of Chongqing in southwest China is to
allocate three billion yuan (about 361 million US dollars) in the
coming four years to carry out new sewage treatment projects, in a
bid to control growing environmental pollution in its urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The planned investment is equal to the total investment in this
aspect over the past dozens of years.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, one of the country's economic giants, has urban
sewage treatment plants which currently can only handle a total of
5,040 tons of liquid sewage per day, 6.3 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the city has set a goal to have 80 percent of its
urban liquid sewage treated by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2004, the city will have six large urban sewage
treatment plants and a 75-km long sewage transfer pipe.

Chongqing Municipality in northwest China plans to invest 10
billion yuan (1.2 billion U.S. dollars) to improve the ecological
environment in the coming ten years, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, Chongqing will turn 183,300 ha of low-
yield farmland on slopes of mountains into forests and grassland,
take good care of the existing 2.3 million ha of forest resources,
and plant trees and grass in 1.06 million ha of wasteland.
</P>
<P>
When the work is finished in 2010, the city's vegetation
coverage rate will increase from 23 percent at present to 36
percent.
</P>
<P>
As part of the ambitious ten-year plan, the city will also make
great effort to ban unauthorized reclamation and logging, and
crack down illegal wood trading.

 Chinese Vice Premier Urges Quicker Greening
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier Wen Jiabao said at a plenary meeting of
the National Greening Committee (NGC) held in Beijing last week
that the country will continue to push forward the campaign of all
the people volunteering to plant trees.
</P>
<P>
Wen, also director of the NGC, said that the country should
also accelerate afforestation in both urban and rural areas,
improve ecological environment and conditions of agriculture and
coordinate afforestation efforts with the implementation of the
national strategy of developing the western part of China.
</P>
<P>
He said that many green corridors should be developed across
the country and various key ecological projects should be
accelerated.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve the quality of afforestation, he said that
the country has to strengthen management, rely on technology,
improve relevant mechanism, strengthen enforcement of laws and
improve leadership in this respect.

China Develops Eco-Agriculture
</P>
<P>
China has made substantial achievements in eco-agriculture in
the past two decades, according to a national conference on eco-
farming.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first day of the conference, the vice-minister
of agriculture, Zhang Baowen, said that in the early 1980s China
initiated experiments in eco-farming to deal with the situation of
deteriorating environment.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, several central government departments formed a
national leading group on eco-agriculture and set up 51 state-
level eco-agriculture pilot counties. Over six billion yuan has
been invested in the pilots counties, generating about 13.7
billion yuan. Local farmers have benefited a lot from the projects.

JERUSALEM -- Israel will not allow any foreign troop deployment
over its northern border that threatens its unilateral withdrawal
from south Lebanon, Israeli military sources said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Any foreign troop deployment over Israel's northern border would
be regarded by Israel as an infringement of the "red lines" between
Israeli and Syrian troops in Lebanon, the sources told Israel
Radio.
</P>
<P>
The military sources made these remarks while commenting on the
Lebanese Defense Minister Ghazi Zaiter's statement on Saturday that
Beirut may ask Syrian troops to deploy in south Lebanon after
Israel's pullout there. (Israel-Lebanon)

to Lebanese President Emile Lahoud concerning "the latest
development in the region and result of Geneva summit" after his

On Lebanese Defense Minister Ghazi Zuetir's speech of inviting
Syrian troops into south Lebanon in the event of Israel's

But Sarid turned down Barak's suggestions categorically, saying

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Africa-Europe Summit Opportunity for New, Strategic Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- After over three years of
consultations and preparations, African and European leaders are
eventually to sit together to reshape bilateral relations with an
eye on strategic dialog and partnership, but the path is difficult.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from 53 African states and 15 European Union members
will gather in Cairo Monday for the first Africa-Europe summit,
proposed by Portugal in 1996 and finally endorsed by both the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the EU later 1999.
</P>
<P>
The leaders are expected at the two-day summit to discuss
economic, political and social development issues in Africa and
explore means of intensifying bilateral cooperation in these
fields.
</P>
<P>
The EU, with seven of its members former colonial powers in
Africa, gives about 15 billion U.S. dollars to Africa every five
years, more than any other single source.
</P>
<P>
Spurring the EU quest for a "new strategic partnership" with
Africa is the realization that the assistance it gives to the
region is failing to pull most countries out of underdevelopment.
</P>
<P>
Poverty, debts, wars and diseases are almost labels of Africa.
Half of its 700 million population are living in poverty and the
staggering 350 billion dollars external debts are choking African
economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest U.N. figures, African nations are
spending 23 billion dollars, or 30.9 percent of their exports, to
service the 350 billion dollars external debts every year.
</P>
<P>
As such, African local governments hardly have money for
education, infrastructure and technological upgrade. The poor
investment environment in turn scared away foreign investors,
hindering economic development and expansion.
</P>
<P>
In years, Africa has remained as a major raw material supplier,
relying heavily on exports of agricultural and mineral products for
hard currency. Simultaneously, they import industrial goods from
developed countries, which eats away most of their revenues.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of Africa's exports in the world's total amount
has been declining steadily in recent years, mainly due to the
countries' failure to open up industrial products markets, with raw
materials and semi-processed industrial products accounting for 80
percent of its total exports to the EU and North America.
</P>
<P>
Outcries for concrete EU help, such as the debt reduction or
forgiveness, more financial aid and investment, are strong among
the African states. They like the summit to concentrate on their
pressing concerns.
</P>
<P>
OAU Assistant Secretary-General for Eastern Africa Sigh Makhan
said Sunday that the African countries want the summit to discuss
issues "of primary concern to us" and "the partnership (with EU)
should be able to help us carry out economic reforms, including
structural adjustment, in the light of economic globalization."
</P>
<P>
Portugal's Foreign Minister Jaime Gama, whose country is holding
the EU Presidency, said on Sunday after the EU foreign ministers
meeting that "we have announced that, for the most poor countries,
we have a strategy of debt relief which is sound and will be
addressed in the appropriate framework of the international
financial institutions."
</P>
<P>
"Also, we have targets for alleviating Africa's poverty and
contributing to their efforts in close cooperation with the African
states. We are working seriously upon that," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said tackling environment, AIDS, poverty and a number of
other social affairs "is a common responsibility, we must address
those issues in cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"And that is the reason why we are searching for a Euro-African
strategic partnership, which is being created in this (upcoming)
first Africa-Europe summit," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Europeans had seen the conference as a mainly political
event, seeking to put African conflict prevention, good governance,
democracy and human rights issues in the limelight.
</P>
<P>
Different as their hopes pinned on the conference, the sides
seemed to come to terms with each other at the eleventh hour on the
summit agenda, agreeing to address democracy, conflict prevention
and human rights alongside economic matters and development
concerns.
</P>
<P>
The wars and conflicts have left 3.5 million refugees on the
continent and further worsened the economic situation.
</P>
<P>
The summit is expected to issue a joint declaration, which will
stress the importance of carrying out cooperation between Africa
and the EU in various fields, and adopt a plan of action guiding
the concrete steps.
</P>
<P>
Observers believes, despite the unavoidable differences over
priority concerns between the two sides, the leaders from both
continents have seen the need for strategic partnership and
measures to solve the African problems because the problems like a
two-edge sword are detrimental not only to Africa, but also to
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the summit will duly provide an opportunity for the
Africans and Europeans to edge toward the achieving of their hoped-
for goals.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak to Mediate between Syria, Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The chance to achieve peace
between Syria and Israel is still in exsitence as Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak will try to bridge the gap between the two
countries, said Syrian diplomatic sources here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak will visit Syria and hold a summit meeting with Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad soon after he meets Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who paid a visit to the United States recently and met
U.S. President Bill Clinton on the Middle East peace process
especially on the Syrian-Israeli track, had a phone call with Assad
Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Murabak's mediation between Syria and Israel is backed by the
United States, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Israel was ready to return the Golan Heights to Syria but tried
to change the border lines of June 4, 1967, particularly on the
northwest bank of Tibrias Lake in order to control the water
sources in the Golan Heights, they noted. The area in question used
to be under Syrian control till June 4, 1967.
</P>
<P>
During the Geneva summit, Clinton conveyed to Assad Israel's
proposals to hand over Al-Hemma district to Syria in lieu of
keeping all the shores of Tibrias under Israeli control. However,
Assad turned down the offer.
</P>
<P>
Clinton asked Assad to offer new suggestions to bread the
deadlock over the following weeks, thereby letting the door ajar
for hopes to revive the Syrian-Israeli peace talks in cooperation
with Arab and European mediators, the sources pointed out.

<HEADLINE> African, EU FMs Meeting Ends With Agreement on Summit Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of African and
the European Union (EU) states ended here on Sunday a one-day
meeting aimed at making final preparations for the first, two-day
Africa-Europe summit due Monday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers reached agreement on the summit agenda
involving economic, political and social issues in Africa and ways
of enhancing cooperation over these issues between Africa and the
EU, Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama told reporters after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ministers overcame the differences over the subjects to be
dealt with during the upcoming summit, said Gama, whose country is
holding EU's rotating presidency for the first half of 2000. But he
did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
While EU states mainly deem the summit as a political event to
take up democratization, human rights issues, conflict prevention
and good governance, the African countries are equally determined
to put emphasis on trade, investment, aid and debts.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers agreed to continue their countries'
efforts to seek intensive cooperation in resolving economic,
political and social problems in Africa, the Portuguese official
said.
</P>
<P>
A ministerial group, which is expected to be set up during the
summit, will meet soon after the summit to seek ways of carrying
out what will be decided by the leaders, Gama added.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also proposed that a second summit be held in 2003
to continue the efforts exerted by the EU and Africa to promote
cooperation in the development of the African continent, he said.

<HEADLINE> New IMF Chief Supports "State Barrier" for Capital Market:Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, April 2 (Xinhua)--Horst Koehler, the new German chief
of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), supported countries to
construct "national guard rails" for the capital market to prevent
possible financial crises, a news weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
At an interview with Germany's well-known "Der Spiegel"
magazine (this week issue), Koehler said he did not agree with the
"radical neo-liberal reform" of the United States.
</P>
<P>
A panel appointed by the U.S. parliament demanded developing
countries fully open their capital markets to western banks, a
policy that Koehler criticized as "of high risk."
</P>
<P>
"Every country must decide itself, how fast and with which
step it will open to the international financial market. I mean
the weaker should have fair chance," Koehler told Der Spiegel.
</P>
<P>
He called for "regulation framework of market economy for the
globalized world," and "guard rails for capital market."
</P>
<P>
"The experiences of economic transition in the east European
countries in recent ten years show that, the free market will have
its positive effect for everyone only after it has a functional
institutional basis," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore I take the 'open market or nothing' policy as
highly risky."
</P>
<P>
As an example, Koehler said the state should have the ability
to control inflow of short-term speculation investment with cash
depot.
</P>
<P>
Over his IMF reform plan, Koehler said: " the IMF should not
become a rescuer of private profits, although the private capital
market is the major initiative of stability and growth of world
economy. "
</P>
<P>
About the future roles of the world's two most important
financial institutions, namely the IMF and the World Bank, Kohler
said: "the World Bank's top duty will be fighting against poverty,
and the IMF should concentrate on crises preventing."
</P>
<P>
"But it is plausible that the two institutions achieve common
understandings," said Koehler.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Koehler told the "Welt am Sontag" newspaper that
he welcomed Asian countries' growing importance in the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The policy of the first German chief in a leading
international institution will "go on a conflict course against
the U.S." said Der Spiegel.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Koehler himself told the weekly that the U.S. had
tried to prevent his appointment until the last minute.
</P>
<P>
An official of the U.S. Financial Ministry had directly urged
him to quit the candidacy just before last month's IMF meeting
that picked him to lead the institution, Koehler told the magazine.

<HEADLINE> Russia's CEC Sets Putin's Inauguration on May 7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian President-elect Vladimir
Putin will be sworn in on May 7, Russia's Central Election
Commission (CEC)chairman Alexander Veshnyakov said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We have scheduled a sitting of the Central Election Commission
for April 5 to sum up official results of the March 26 Russian
presidential election. The commission will officially publish its
resolution through the press on April 7. Under the law, the
inauguration of the president should take place 30 days after the
official publishing of the election results, that is on May 7,2000,
" Veshnyakov told the Russian RTR television station.
</P>
<P>
"So far, I can say that the election and the calculation of
votes were well organized and disciplined, and complied with the
law," he said.
</P>
<P>
"According to the updated reports, Vladimir Putin gained 52.9
percent of votes in the election," he announced.
</P>
<P>
As for claims of the election staff of the Communist Party
leader Gennady Zyuganov about falsified results, Veshnyakov said,
"the Central Election Commission has not been given any particular
facts, so it's mere words. Still, we are ready to consider any
documents they have."

<HEADLINE> Canada, U.S. in Talks on Rerouting of Toxic Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Canada is in talks with the U.S.
military on the rerouting of a Vancouver-bound shipload of toxic
waste from U.S. facilities in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Canada's National Post newspaper Sunday quoted Environment
Minister David Anderson as saying that Canadian officials "are
currently discussing alternatives with the United States
Department of Defense" on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Canada hopes that the two sides will agree to have a change in
the proposal put forward "to ship this waste to Canada" on April 7,
as previously scheduled, indicated the minister who was reporting
to the House of Commons Friday.
</P>
<P>
The talks on the rerouting of toxic waste came amid strong
opposition from greenpeace activists in Canada, who fear that
their southern neighbor is making their country a dumping ground
of waste.
</P>
<P>
The government of Ontario had earlier rejected a U.S. company's
attempt to send the waste to a disposal facility on Kirkland Lake
in the province.
</P>
<P>
A 1999 U.S. Department of Defense report made public Thursday
already suggested that Canada was a reluctant dumping ground for
PCBs, developed 70 years ago and now linked to cancer.
</P>
<P>
The report referred to "current shipments" of PCBs from
overseas military bases that are in jeopardy because of Canada's
skittishness about accepting toxic waste that the U.S. won't admit
across its own borders.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian environment minister, however, did not rule out
the possibility that the country may eventually accept the
shipment under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Canada might be unable to reject it if the PCB level in the
shipment is within acceptable federal limits, that is, a shipment
below 50 parts per million, the minister was quoted as suggesting.
</P>
<P>
While Canada and most other countries accept the international
shipment of materials with PCBs below 50 parts per million, the U.
S. government prohibits the importation of the chemical at any
detectable level, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Alliance Accepted for Using "Conservative" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Elections Canada, the federal
agency that registers party names, has accepted the use of the
word "Conservative" by the newly formed Canadian Reform
Conservative Alliance (CRCA) party.
</P>
<P>
The Calgary-based elections watchdog agency ruled Sunday that
the alliance of former Reformers and some provincial Conservatives
can use the name which, it said, "does not so resemble" other
party names in the country.
</P>
<P>
A local news release quoted Chief Electoral Officer Jean-Pierre
Kingsley as saying "I have accepted the application" by CRCA for
its official party name.
</P>
<P>
The ruling came after the federal Conservatives challenged the
new CRCA party for using the same word "Conservative", while
similar complaints were arising about possible name confusion from
the Canadian Action Party and the fledgling New Green Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Action Party believes that the acronym CRCA plus
the word party (CRCAP) is too close to the short form of its own --
the CAP, while the New Green Alliance fears that people may get
confused about two Alliances.
</P>
<P>
The decision by Elections Canada was much to the relief of the
CRCA national council, which hailed the Sunday's ruling "a great
day for democracy."
</P>
<P>
"This party is an alliance between Reform and members of
Conservative parties across the country and we're glad to have
this fact recognized by Elections Canada," said Rod Love, a member
of the CRCA national council.
</P>
<P>
Reformers last month voted to replace the party with a unite-
the-right alliance under the banner of CRCA in a bid to unseat the
ruling Liberal in the next election.
</P>
<P>
Reformers, who enjoy the Official Opposition status in
Parliament with 60 seats, are optimistic about a victory with the
support from provincial Conservatives from Alberta and vote-rich
Ontario, which accounts for no less than 103 of the 301 seats in
the House of Commons.

<HEADLINE> Volkswagen to Control Swedish Truck Maker Scania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, April 2 (Xinhua)-German automotive giant Volkswagen
Sunday stepped into the lucrative truck and bus market by
controlling Swedish Scania.
</P>
<P>
At a special meeting in Wolfsburg, the Volkswagen supervisory
board agreed to take over 34 percent of Scania voting right and
become its biggest owner.
</P>
<P>
The Volkswagen management called it a "bargain", since the
German group invested only 3 billion marks (1.5 billion dollars),
counting about 18.7 percent of Scania capital.
</P>
<P>
Scania, which sold 50,000 heavy trucks and buses last year, is
the third European truck maker behind Daimler-Chrysler and Volvo,
and its profit margin is among the world's highest.
</P>
<P>
The take-over directly attributed to an earlier EU veto
against Scania's planned merger with Volvo. The talks leading to
Volkswagen take-over began last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Volvo, also a Swedish automotive maker, owns 45.5 per cent of
Scania shares, but its voting right counts only 30.9 per cent.Thus
it become the second owner
</P>
<P>
Volkeswagen, annually producing only 9000 heavy trucks in
Latin America, has been interested in Scania since middle 1990s.
Their deal went to a deadlock two years ago after Scania demanded
a "high price."

<HEADLINE> Russian Commando's Loss in Vedeno Ambush Adds Up to 43 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chechen rebels' ambush on a Russian OMON police convoy, and
their subsequent surprise attack against a second, federal relief
convoy, cost the federal units 43 men killed in all, said Russia's
deputy commandant of Vedeno district Colonel Ilya Lukin.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian police force lost 37 men, and the commandant's
company six men, with another 15 soldiers wounded. Out of all 49
federal servicemen of the ambushed troop, only five police
officers and one member of the commandant's company survived the
ambush uninjured," Lukin said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military on Saturday said 32 bodies of Russian
servicemen had been found on the battlefield at the ambush site.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted source from the Russian federal
forces in Chechnya as saying that the rebels had been tracking the
movement of the first and second convoys all along.
</P>
<P>
"They fired at the Russian armored vehicles with grenade
launchers and then at the OMON troops with silenced sniper rifles,
" said the source.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Sunday that he
believes the federal elite OMON unit died in Chechnya due to
indiscipline by executive officials.
</P>
<P>
"The reasons for what took place lie above all in the field of
inadequately firm centralized management and lack of efficiency
among officials to cope with the duties allocated and endorsed by
Interior and Defense Ministers," he told journalists in Tajik
capital of Dushanbe, where he was inspecting a joint CIS military
exercise.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said an investigation has already been conducted and
its
findings have been turned over to the Prosecutor's Office for "
determining who is to be blamed and to what extent."
