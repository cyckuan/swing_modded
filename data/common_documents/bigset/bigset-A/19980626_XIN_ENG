<HEADLINE> Clinton Speaks of His First Impression on China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Here in this ancient capital, China
seems very young to me tonight, blessed with both a proud history
and the promise of tomorrow, U.S. President bill Clinton said here
this evening.
</P>
<P>
"Over 1,000 years ago, Xi'an was perhaps the most open and
culturally advanced city in the entire world," the U.S. president
said to thousands of local people who gave him a "magnificant
welcome" as he said.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to learning more about China's great
contributions to the store of human knowledge, from medicine and
printing to mathematics and astronomy -- discoveries on which so
much of the whole world's progress is based," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And I want to see more of the new nation you are building on a
scale even the emperors could not have foreseen," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived here earlier this evening for a nine-day state
visit at the invitation of Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
The visit, a return to the state visit by his Chinese
counterpart Jiang Zemin last October, marks a major event in the
Sino-U.S. relations, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is accompanied by his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton,
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Secretary of Treasury
Robert Rubin, and other senior U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an is the first leg of his nine-day tour of China and he is
scheduled to visit Beijing, Shanghai, Guilin and Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Argentina Sign Accord on Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
signed Thursday with his visiting Argentine counterpart, Carlos
Menem, an agreement on the basic principles of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The document, inked after their talks in the Kremlin, calls for
closer contacts at different levels between the two countries,
including annual consultations between their foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also encourages broadening exchanges between the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and the Rio Group and
the South American Common Market.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the two countries also signed several accords on
air traffic, cooperation between interior ministries, cultural and
educational exchanges and mutual protection of investments.
</P>
<P>
Menem arrived here Wednesday on a state visit. Before finishing
his Russia trip and fly Sunday to his next destination, the
Ukrainian capital of Kiev, he is scheduled to visit St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
Argentina is one of Russia's major trading partners in South
America. Annual trade between the two countries has leaped from
140 million U.S. dollars to 225 million dollars in recent years,
but it still falls short of the two governments' expectation of 3
billion dollars, the peak volume in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Fuel, lubricants, power and mining equipment, aviation
technology and road-paving machinery are Russia's main exports to
Argentina, while Argentina's main exports to Russia are food
products such as vegetable oil, meat and fruits.

NEW DELHI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- India said Thursday that any
team from the United Nations is welcome to the country but it
ruled out any third party mediation to resolve bilateral issues
between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to a special team sent by U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan to tour Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, sources from the

always welcome to visit India and have discussions on global
issues including nuclear disarmament.

<P>
India "has reiterated on many occasions that there is no scope
for third party mediation of any nature whatsoever in respect of
India's relations with Pakistan," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
India-Pakistan issues including Kashmir are purely bilateral
and have to be resolved through bilateral dialogue only, he added.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Rating Affirmed At "A+:" IBCA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Fitch IBCA, the international
rating agency, affirmed Thursday its "A+" Long-term foreign
currency rating for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The agency also affirmed its rating of "F1+" for short-term
issues and of "AA+" for sovereign issues in Hong Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the above affirmation, the rating agency said in a
statement, "The fiscal package announced by the Hong Kong
government on 22 June is a small but welcome contribution to the
process of restoring confidence in the economy."
</P>
<P>
The measures in total have been cost by the authorities at HKD
32 bn (2.3 percent of GDP) and will produce a deficit of at least
HKD 21 bn, it adds.
</P>
<P>
The agency believed this is clearly unusual for a society
acclimated to continuing surpluses but, seen in the light of an
accumulated fiscal surplus of some HKD 450 bn, is hardly fiscal
recklessness.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, IBCA stated the decision to suspend government land
sales for nine months against the background of a fall in property
prices of about 40 percent since the peak last year can be
regarded as common sense, rather than a massive departure from
Hong Kong's traditional non-interventionist approach.
</P>
<P>
The agency argued the major concern remains the fixed link to
the U.S. dollar and Hong Kong's commitment to the automatic
currency board mechanism which underpins this.
</P>
<P>
However, IBCA believed the behavior of the authorities over the
past year gives no reason to doubt this commitment, and the same
is true of the Chinese authorities.
</P>
<P>
Between them, the agency said, they have enough foreign
exchange reserves to repel all but the most massive of speculative
attacks. Furthermore, the agency cannot see what advantage could
be gained by permitting the link to break.

KATHMANDU, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government has agreed

<HEADLINE> U.S. Revises Economic Growth at 5.4 Pct in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy grew 5.4
percent at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in the first quarter
of this year, much more strongly than previously estimated,
according to a report from the Commerce Department here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is also one of the most strongest quarterly growth rates
during the past 15 years. The economy grew at a 6 percent rate in
April-June 1996 and October-December 1987 and at a 6.4 percent
rate in April-June 1984.
</P>
<P>
But much of the latest growth spurt came from a buildup in
business inventories, which already is slowing growth in the
current quarter.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth in the first quarter of this year initially was
estimated at a very robust 4.2 percent rate. The estimate was
raised to 4.8 percent a month ago and boosted again today.
</P>
<P>
The department partly attributed the latest revision to the
fact that the nation's trade deficit, hurt by Asian financial
turmoil, didn't deteriorate as much as first thought. Exports fell
at a 1.2 percent rate instead of a 3 percent rate and imports
increased at a 17.1 percent rate instead of a 17.7 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
Besides, economists have raised concern about the stockpile of
unsold goods in inventory which increased by a record 105.7
billion dollars, considerably more than first estimated. Among the
factors in the revision was an increase in the stock of unsold
used cars.
</P>
<P>
Without the huge addition to inventories, total economic output
in the first quarter would have grown at a 3.7 percent annual
rate.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the inventory overhang and worsening
Asia-related trade problems, many economists believe growth in the
second quarter has moderated to less than a 3 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, growth was driven by consumer spending,
up at a 6 percent annual rate, the most in six years; business
investment in new equipment, up at a 26.4 percent rate, the best
in more than 14 years; and housing construction, up at a 16.9
percent rate, the most in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
In addition to trade, the other negative was federal defense
spending, down at an 18.6 percent rate, the most in more than three
years.
</P>
<P>
The first-quarter growth was accomplished with minimal
inflation. A price gauge tied to the GDP advanced at a 1.2 percent
rate. That's up from an initial estimate of 0.9 percent but
nevertheless still the best in 35 years.
</P>
<P>
However, companies' inability to raise prices in the face of
foreign competition is causing a profit squeeze. After-tax
corporate profits fell 1.2 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
In another separate report made public Thursday by the Labor
Department, first-time applications for unemployment benefits
jumped by 34,000 last week to 364,000, the highest level in nearly
a year. Many of the new claims came in Michigan, Wisconsin,
Indiana, New York and Ohio, states where GM operates.
</P>
<P>
Also, the National Association of Realtors reported Thursday
that sales of existing single-family homes rose 1 percent in May
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.82 million. That's just
short of March's record pace of 4.89 million homes and leaves
sales on a pace to set a record for the full year.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Three-Year ESAF Credit for Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Thursday announced the approval of a three-year credit for
Tajikistan under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility,
equivalent to about 128 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The credit is provided in support of the government's 1998-2001
economic program. The first annual loan is equivalent to about 48
million dollars and is divided into two equal semiannual
installments, the first of which is available immediately.
</P>
<P>
The government's medium-term strategy is based on export-led
growth, building on a liberal foreign trade and investment regime.
The program envisions real GDP growth of 4 to 4.5 percent a year
from 1999 through 2001. In the first year of the program, GDP
growth is targeted at 3.4 percent in 1998, inflation at 16.8
percent, and the external current account deficit at 5.0 percent
of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Tajikistan joined the IMF in April 1993. Its quota in the IMF
is about 80 million dollars and its outstanding use of the IMF
financing currently totals about 40 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Disarmament Ends 2nd Part of 1998 Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Conference on Disarmament (CD)
ended the second part of the 1998 session here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 61-member conference will resume on July 27 for the final
part of the 1998 session which will end on September 9.
</P>
<P>
During the second part of the session, 46 CD members and
observers signed a joint statement condemning nuclear testing in
May by India and then by Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The signatories "are alarmed and deeply concerned at nuclear
testing by India and Pakistan," said the statement drafted by
Australia and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
"They condemn all nuclear testing and consider such acts to be
contrary to the international consensus which bans the testing of
nuclear weapons and other explosive devices," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The tests undertaken by India and Pakistan's decision to
respond with its own tests blatantly undermine the international
regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons," it said. "The
actions of India and Pakistan threaten and undermine the process
of disarmament and the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons
altogether."
</P>
<P>
They called on India and Pakistan to resolve their tensions
"through constructive dialogue and negotiation."
</P>
<P>
Many members said that the nuclear tests last month in South
Asia should push the conference into action when it meets next
month.
</P>
<P>
"While we can honestly disagree about the scope of the work we
should undertake in the conference, we should at least be able to
agree on the facts regarding what has been achieved so far in
working toward nuclear disarmament," said U.S. Ambassador Robert
Grey Jr Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The issue of landmines could also be discussed next month at
the CD meeting.

<TEXT>

<P>
SAINT-ETIENNE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Mexico salvaged a 2-2 draw with
the Netherlands on Thursday and both teams qualified for the second
round.
</P>
<P>
The first half saw the domination of the Dutch team and just
five minutes into the match, Phillip Cocu put the Netherlands 1-0
ahead as he beat the Mexican defender and the charging out
goal-keeper with a right-footer.
</P>
<P>
Some 13 minutes later, Ronald De Boer picked the ball in the
Mexican area and slamed it home to give the Dutch a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
It seemed that the Dutch could win the match easily but in the
second half, the Mexican refused to give up and quickened their pace.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands made some substitutions in the second half and lost
the domination of midfield. The Mexican team took full advantage of
that and forced the Dutch team into defence with quick attacking.
</P>
<P>
Their efforts paid off at the 75th minute when Ricardo Pelaez
jumped high and headed home to make it 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Mexico were disallowed a goal at the 89th minute as the referee
called it off-side. Ramon Ramirez argued the decision with the
referee and was shown the red card.
</P>
<P>
The sent-off didn't shake the Mexicans' determination and they
kept on attacking. Just seconds before the final whistle, Luis
Hernandez hit in the equaliser three meters in front of the goal to
complete the exciting game.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands and Mexican both have five points to their credit
and the Dutch team qualified as the group winners as they have a
better goal difference than the Mexican team.
</P>
<P>
In the other match played at the Parc des Princes stadium in
Paris, South Korea forced the Belgian team to a 1-1 draw.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans and the Belgian team were both eliminated.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Scuttles Belgium with 1-1 Draw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A second-half equalizer from Yoo Sang
Chul doused Belgium's hope to qualify for the second round of the
World Cup finals here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 1-1 draw at Parc des Princes meant that Belgium failed to
qualify for the first time for the second round of the top soccer
competition since 1982.
</P>
<P>
Yoo, the veteran defender from Ulsan Hyundai, netted in the 72nd
minute on a pass from Ha Seok Ju.
</P>
<P>
The Koreans, playing only for pride as they had been eliminated
after their second group match, also had opportunities to win their
first game in five World Cup finals but Choi Yong Soo headed twice
over the crossbar within a span of three minutes.
</P>
<P>
PSV Eindhoven forward Luc Nilis gave Belgium a 1-0 lead before
break when he blasted the ball into the net in the seventh minute.
</P>
<P>
He scored by picking up a rebound off a Korean defender when Gordan
Vidovic tried to head the ball in.
</P>
<P>
Enzo Scifo had an earlier chance to score but the 20-meter shot was
saved by South Korean keeper Kim Byung Ji.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, who had had to win the game to enter the last sixteen,
finished the group E third behind second-placers Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands, who tied with Mexico 2-2 in the other game on
Thursday, finished atop the group while South Korea was at bottom.

<HEADLINE> Malawi Involved in Machel's Death: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Graca Machel, the widow of
Mozambique's former president, has disclosed that Malawi agents
were among the conspirators who eliminated her husband in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Machel said this Tuesday at a hearing of the South Africa's
Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), the Malawi News Agency
(MANA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt that my husband died in a conspiracy
involving Mozambique, Malawi and South African agents," Machel
said in her four-hour testimony before the TRC.
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, the widow who is the companion of South
African President Nelson Mandela, cited names and people who
hatched the conspiracy and their dates of the meetings for the
planned assassination.
</P>
<P>
The apartheid South Africa then blamed bad weather and pilot
error for the plane crash which killed Samora Machel and 30
others inside South Africa over a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
But the Malawi Congress Party (MCP) in power during the crash,
has distanced itself and its government from the charge.
</P>
<P>
"The party and the government were not involved in other
countries' affairs or conflict," MANA quoted Hetherwick Ntaba,
the MCP treasurer general as saying Wendesday when it sought the
party's views on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Ntaba, however, said that Machel could be alluding to agents
who were not government or party officials but from other
countries and might have operated from Malawi, adding "Malawi had
a policy of peaceful co-existence then."
</P>
<P>
But Malawi's Defense Minister Joseph Kubwalo said the
allegations should not be dismissed because the MCP was involved
in a lot of sinister acts during its reign.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that the Machel saga was a very sad development
and the new Malawi which maintains very friendly relations with
Mozambique and South Africa "just fails short of apologizing for
what may have happened."
</P>
<P>
Kubwalo added that the Muluzi administration was willing to
assist the TRC or the Mozambican government in further inquiries
into the crash.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Still Exports Fish to EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is still exporting its
fish and fishery products to the European Union (EU) because it
has met a significant part of the standards of the 15-member
bloc, a press release has said.
</P>
<P>
The press release, issued Thursday by the Uganda National
Bureau of Standards (UNBS), stated that recent press reports are
not accurate when indicating that fish exports from east Africa,
including Uganda, to EU has been banned.
</P>
<P>
It said Uganda was placed on List 2 of countries allowed to
export fish and fishery products to Europe. The countries
grouped into this category are said to have satisfied most of the
EU requirements but are not fully harmonized because they need to
carry out more improvement.
</P>
<P>
Countries on this list are allowed to export fish to EU
through bilateral arrangements with EU member countries. In other
words, each EU member state can choose the establishments to deal
with.
</P>
<P>
Countries on List 1 are those which have been harmonized and
allowed to export fish products to the EU market without
particular limitations while countries on List 3 are those whose
evaluation is still pending or which have so far not achieved a
significant level of quality improvement.
</P>
<P>
An EU inspection team is to visit Uganda in September this
year to evaluate the fish processing industry with the view of
upgrading Uganda to List 1 if the EU requirements are met, the
press release added.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the temporary ban on export of chilled fish which
has been imposed by EU since December 1997 due to the outbreak of
cholera, the UNBS said the ban will be lifted from July 1, 1998.
The export of frozen fish products to EU, which has not been
affected by the above-mentioned temporary ban, continues.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's fish processing sector has expanded greatly in recent
years and current export earnings are in excess of 100 million
U.S. Dollars per year.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Criticizes Israel's Jerusalem Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) Thursday
strongly denounced an Israeli decision to expand Jerusalem as
having "adverse impact on the entire (Middle East) peace process,"
the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The decision will "give Israel full control of the holy city,
obliterate its Arab entity and change its demographic feature," a
statement issue at the end of an AL meeting said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet on Sunday approved a plan to set up an
"umbrella authority" for Jerusalem over eight West Bank Jewish
settlements to the east, south and north.
</P>
<P>
The 22-nation Arab organization urged the United Nations
Security Council to discuss the Israeli "dangerous decision."
</P>
<P>
It called the Israeli plan a flagrant violation of the relevant
United Nations resolutions, under which any Israeli measures
adopted for the holy city are null and void.
</P>
<P>
The AL voiced full support for the Palestinians, who have been
pinning the blame on Israel for changing the status of Jerusalem
by approving the plan.
</P>
<P>
Agreements signed between the Palestinians and Israel demand
that neither side take unilateral actions concerning the city,
which should be negotiated in the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
The AL called on the United States and Russia, co-sponsors of
the peace process, and the European Union to take serious and
decisive stances regarding Israel's activities, which it said
"disregard the rights and feelings of both Muslims and Christians
worldwide."
</P>
<P>
It called for intensive consultations to adopt a unified stance
that will help protect Arab rights and offer all possible support
to the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> 12 Die in Traffic Accident in N. Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A traffic accident in northern
Zambia has left 12 people dead on the spot while 21 others
injured after the truck they were traveling in tried to avoid
road drums and overturned.
</P>
<P>
Zambia News Agency ZANA Thursday quoted Starfor Phiri,
northwestern province police regional commanding officer, who
confirmed the accident as saying Thursday that the accident
happened around 21:00 hours Wednesday when the vehicle was going
to Zambezi from Solwezi.
</P>
<P>
The injured were later admitted to Solwezi general hospital
and now all of them are out of danger, according to the
hospital's executive director Sylvester Chilaika.
</P>
<P>
The driver, who survived the accident, said at the hospital
that the truck overturned because a construction company
currently tarring the road has not put up road deviation signs to
show that the main road is closed.
</P>
<P>
He said since he was driving at night, he realized too late
that the road has been closed and saw the drums barriers rather
too late and as he swayed trying to avoid hitting into the drums,
the vehicle overturned.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, another motorist also overturned at the same
spot around 24:00 hours, said ZANA. He blamed the construction
company for not putting up deviation signs to warn motorists for
the barrier ahead.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government
acknowledged Thursday that stakeholders and the donor community
have lost confidence in the agricultural sector investment
program (ASIP) because it has been poorly implemented.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a two-day meeting on the review of the program
held in Lusaka, Agricultural Minister Amusaa Mwanamwambwa said
the ASIP has not achieved the desired objectives to benefit the
country's small-scale farmers since it was implemented two and
half years ago, Zambia News Agency ZANA reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting attracted several high commissioners and
ambassadors accredited to Zambia as well as members of parliament
on the agricultural committee.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a serious erosion of stakeholders' confidence
in the ASIP program because it has not achieved the intended
objectives in the year under review," said the minister when
presenting a proposed action plan aimed at restructing the
program to make it more effective.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the program has been unable to attract donor
support because of its poor performance and stressed the need to
review it.
</P>
<P>
At the same meeting, George Mburathi, United Nations Food and
Agricultural Organization (FAO) representative in Zambia, also
stated that the ASIP has lost credibility in the eyes of the
donor community.
</P>
<P>
He called for the restructuring of the program if it has to
continue receiving donor support.
</P>
<P>
The FAO representative also called for renewed government
commitment toward the implementation of ASIP and the involvement
of the private sector.

MADRID, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Foreign Minister Matutes on
Thursday blasted Israel's extension of Jerusalem's municipal
boundaries as an act jeopardizing the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The June 21 move by the government of Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, said Matutes, was against the principles laid
down in the Oslo agreement on bringing peace to the region.
</P>
<P>
The 15 European Union (EU) members, including Spain, are
against the unilateral change of Jerusalem's status regardless the
protest of Arab nations and the Palestinians, he said,
</P>
<P>
The Spanish foreign minister therefore urged the Israeli
government to reconsider its decision sure to further damage the
already deadlocked Middle East peace process.

PARIS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korean coach Kim Pyung Seok said
on Thursday South Korea's draw with Mexico would help the co-hosting
of the 2002 World Cup finals with Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Our losses to Mexico and the Netherlands really demoralized our
players, but today's draw was a reward for the fans' support and would
help our hosting of the 2002 finals," said Kim after their 1-1 tie.
</P>
<P>
Kim, who replaced Cha Bum Kun after their 5-0 loss to the Dutches,
added, "Our players played today to their great potential. After
conceding the goal in the first half, we had plenty of time trying to
equalize."
</P>
<P>
Belgian coach Geroge Leekens blamed his team for sitting back too
early in the match. Belgium was eliminated from the rest of the
competition.
</P>
<P>
Leekens said, "We had a good beginning. But we have relaxed after
our goal. I do not know whether my players sit back mentally or the
Koreans played in a very relaxed way."
</P>
<P>
Luc Nilis scored the goal for Belgium in the seventh minute but Yoo
Sang Chul levelled the score in the 72nd minute.
</P>
<P>
Leekens added, "However, if we had won 1-0, we were out of the
competition as well."
</P>

He explained he substituted Enzo Scifo with Van der Elst in the
second half in order to have a more balanced team.

XI'AN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Following are some sidebars after
U.S. President Clinton's arrival in Xi'an City:
</P>
<P>
-- Twin Brother-Sister Presenting Flowers
</P>
<P>
As President Clinton alighted from Air Force One, a pair of
11-year-old twin brother-sister, who look very much alike,
stepped forward to present the president and the first lady with
fresh flowers and offered their regards in English.
</P>
<P>
Both are the fifth graders at the Kaitongxiang Primary School
in Xi'an. The elder brother is called Yu Zhengzhong and his
younger sister is Yu Zhengxin.
</P>
<P>
-- Clinton Awaiting Reporters in Limousine
</P>
<P>
After brief greetings with local officials at the airport, the
president stepped into his black Lincoln limousine which soon sped
to the ancient city of Xi'an behind police cars.
</P>
<P>
This worried scores of journalists who had the privileges to
cover the president within a short reach, because their bus was at
the back of a motorcade of 50 cars and arrived at the destination
five minutes later.
</P>
<P>
However, upon their arrival, the journalists were glad to see
that the president had just stepped out of his limousine and they
vied with eath other for vantage points at the south gate of the
City Wall.
</P>
<P>
-- Ancient Parade Ritual
</P>
<P>
The president was greeted at the south gate of Xi'an City Wall
with a ceremony that revived an ancient parade ritual in honor of
distinguished guests. The president and Mrs. Clinton walked along
an "imperial path" paved with red carpets, amid sounds of beating
60 huge drums, proceeded by 16 girls dressed in Tang Dynasty
costumes as maids of honor, and greeted by 300 teamed-up armored
warriors in the square.
</P>
<P>
-- Greetings by Xi'an Residents
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast to the scorching heat in the past few days,
Xi'an residents enjoyed cooler weather and light cosy evening
breeze today as the motorcade of President Clinton passes along
the streets of Xi'an.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Ancient Capital Opens Gate of Friendship for Clinton (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Through the centuries-old city gate
of the ancient capital of Xi'an, U.S. President Bill Clinton
walked into China today.
</P>
<P>
The suspension bridge, used to thwart enemies in ancient times,
serenely spanned the banks of the city moat, while the heavy iron
gate has been lifted to greet the first incumbent American
president who has come to visit China in nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
In a dark suit matched with a yellow tie, President Clinton
made his appearance outside Yongning Gate, Xi'an southern city
gate, at about eight p.m. local time (12:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
On the open ground in front of the city wall, the
two-millennium-old Xi'an, amid the thundering of 60 huge drums and
the strains of Tang Dynasty music, welcomed the American president
in a grand ceremony imitating that for greeting distinguished
guests in the heydays of the dynasty more than a millennium ago.
</P>
<P>
A myriad of color bulbs lit the grand city wall that has
silently guarded Xi'an for six centuries, presenting a magnificent
view of a golden-rimmed stone wall beneath the night sky.
</P>
<P>
Walking on the red-carpeted passage toward the Gate, President
Clinton was greeted by enthusiastic well-wishers with kids extending
their hands towards him.
</P>
<P>
At the foot of the city wall, Xi'an Mayor Feng Xuchu presented
the smiling Clinton with a golden key to the city gate.

Accompanied by the Tang-style guest-greeting music, actors clad
in the formal attire of ancient Chinese officials and generals, in
armors of ancient warriors and actresses in Tang Dynasty costumes
filed out of the Gate to greet the U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
Clinton started his speech with the Chinese greeting words of
Nimen Hao, which won warm applause from his audience, and
expressed his respect for China's long civilization.
</P>
<P>
One of the four ancient capitals in the world, Xi'an has played
host to other distinguished guests including former U.S. President
Ronald Reagan, British Queen Elizabeth 2nd, and Japanese Emperor
Akihito.
</P>
<P>
The president and Mrs. Clinton then was led into the city gate
and mounted the gate tower for a night view of the city. The
president waved to local dwellers who thronged the ground beneath
the tower and was greeted by a splash of applauses and waving
hands from some nearby buildings.
</P>
<P>
"Xi'an was the starting point for the Silk Road that connected
the East with the West in ancient times." said Yue Yu, a professor
from Northwest University.
</P>
<P>
He added that President Jiang Zemin's successful visit to the
United States last fall strengthened the friendship between the
peoples of China and the U.S., and "we hope President Clinton's
visit will further the friendly ties between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Clinton signed his name with a Chinese writing brush on the
visitors' book of the ancient city wall scenic zone after his
visit to the wall.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Leader Reiterates Refusal to Join PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin
said Thursday he will not join the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) unless PNA President Yasser Arafat repudiates the Olso
Accords and take part in the struggle against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Yassin made the remarks at a news conference in Gaza, Israel
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
PNA officials said that Arafat earlier asked Hamas to join his
cabinet as part of a reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
But Yassin, accusing the PNA of imprisoning Hamas members,
rejected the offer during his recent trip to Arab countries and
Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas leader said that he would like to cease fire with
Israel if the Jewish state gives up all the Palestinian lands it
seized in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
He has stressed on many occasions that Hamas would not stop its
"holy war" against Israel. He renewed his call for the destruction
of Israel during the news conference.
</P>
<P>
After wrapping up his four-month fundraising tour, Yassin
returned to Gaza late Wednesday night. He has reportedly raised 50
million U.S. dollars during his trip.
</P>
<P>
Israel fears that the funds will strengthen Hamas' military
factions. Yassin, however, has announced that the money will be
given to the poor, the families of prisoners and orphans.
</P>
<P>
PNA-controlled media did not report Yassin's return Wednesday
night. PNA sources said they do not expect Yassin to make any
immediate attempts to challenge the authority of Arafat, who is
working to form a new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
There was a lengthy debate in Israel over whether to let
Yassin back from his trip. After close-door discussions and
deliberations, security officials have recommended that Yassin be
allowed back, saying that he would cause less damage to Israel in
Gaza than he was abroad.

<HEADLINE> Norway Provides $964,000 Aid for Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations humanitarian
aid agencies and the Norwegian government signed here Thursday an
agreement, under which Norway provides Angola with 964,000 U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian government made the grant in response to the
appeal by U.N. agencies to the international community to aid
Angola with a total of 91 million Dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 964,000 Dollars, 540,000 Dollars is for emergency
humanitarian aid, while the rest will be used for a rapid
response by the coordinative agency for humanitarian aid in times
of crisis in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Francesco Strippoli, representative of the coordinative agency
of humanitarian aid in Angola, signed the agreement with Bjorg
Leite, Norwegi Ambassador to Angola.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is very important. It indicates that the
international community will continue to assist Angola until its
wish of final peace is realized, said Strippoli.
</P>
<P>
According to the Norwegian ambassador, her government will
continue to provide aid to the poorest Angolans with an annual
aid total of 20 million to 25 million US Dollars until the
country passes the stage for emergency aid.
</P>
<P>
She also noted that the Norwegian government will also aid
Angola in its post-war rehabilitation and development.
</P>
<P>
Norway has been aiding Angola since 1980, mostly in the fields
of landmine-clearing, education, vocational education for the
demobilized as well as the repairs on infrastructure destroyed
during the two-decade long war.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Eight HIV carriers, including
five Africans and three Europeans, will set out from the Kenyan
capital to climb Africa's highest mountain Kilimanjaro, a report
reaching here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The team, three of them women, planned to officially start the
four-day climbing on June 29 and to reach the 5,895-meter peak on
July 1 so as to coincide the 12th World AIDS Conference in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The African climbers are from Kenya, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso
and South Africa. Two of their European teammates are French,
the other one is a Swiss.
</P>
<P>
Etienne Tape Be, a 26-year-old climber from Ivory Coast, works
with the Abidjan-based Action Lumiere -- one of many support
groups springing up in Africa as the epidemic rages on.
</P>
<P>
"When I found out I was HIV positive in 1994 I was absolutely
crushed for two days. Then I said to myself that I would show I
could deal with it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Joyce Malope, a 24-year-old South African, was infected during
a rape. Kenyan Ruth Wambui is a 37-year-old mother with six
children.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Christian Converts Hit 10 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The number of Chinese Christian
(Protestant) converts has grown from slightly over 100 to over 10
million since the 1840 Opium War, according to Ye Xiaowen,
director of the State Bureau of Religious Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Ye attributed the rapid growth to the independent principles of
the Chinese Christian Church.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at today's press conference hosted by the State
Council Information Office, Ye said the principles of
self-administration, self-support and self-propagation have
enabled the Chinese Christian churches to integrate traditional
Chinese culture and lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
The rapid increase in the number of Christian converts and the
development of China's churches indicates that Chinese Christian
converts perform better in expounding Christian doctrines and
managing their churches better than the foreign missionaries in
the past, according to Ye.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Chinese Christian (Protestant)
Church reveal that China has 18,000 clerics, including over 2,000
ministers, also including over 300 female ministers.
</P>
<P>
The country has either refurbished or constructed over 600
churches every year since the 1980s. China has over 12,000
churches and 25,000 places of worship distributed throughout the
nation, especially in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Christian Church ranks first in the world in the
number of Bibles printed yearly, with a total of 20 million Bibles
published and distributed in China since 1980.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has consistently implemented
preferential policies covering the publication of Bibles,
including the granting of tax exemptions, according to Ye.

Zhou Wenzhi blamed some localities' neglect for disasters caused
in the flood season.
</P>

other places are cultivating the shores of lakes for agricultural
purposes, suffering severe damages in the current flood season.
</P>
<P>
He said that some companies also draw sand from the river
courses, which pose a danger to the safety of river banks.
</P>
<P>
He called on local governments concerned to take tough actions
in accordance with the Anti-flood Law to prevent such actions from
happening again.
</P>
<P>
He said that 21 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities have suffered from floods, with Jiangxi, Fujian,
Hunan, Anhui, Guangxi, Zhejiang and Hubei the worst
affected.

KUALA LUMPUR, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Friday his country did not need to ask for
economic bail-out from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
because of several factors.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia does not have huge external debts and still has
economic strength while its political system is stable, Mahathir
said at the opening of a student leadership seminar here.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia's political system was different from that of
Indonesia, particularly in that Malaysian Cabinet ministers cannot
be involved in business.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysia is still free and able to keep itself
away from the clutches of the IMF. But the country does not know
yet whether it could do as such if a chaotic situation erupts due
to incitement, he added.

<HEADLINE> Spain to Explore China Trade Market: Trade Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Spain is intensifying its
promotional activities in China's mainland and further exploring
the giant market there in response to the growing demand for
quality Spanish products, Spain's Trade Commissioner in Hong Kong
Ernesto Tejedor said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
More than 120 Spanish manufacturers and exhibitors had come to
Hong Kong to participate in the Asia Pacific Leather Fair and V&AMP;S,
the first international wine and spirit exhibition in the
Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Many Spanish exhibitors were pleased to receive new orders from
China and to strike deals with local suppliers to expand
distribution networks, Tejedor said.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Spain and China has been rising steadily. Hong
Kong is an important re-export center for trade between Spain and
China. Spanish re-exports to China through Hong Kong in 1997
reached 300 million U.S. dollars while Hong Kong exports of
products of China origin to Spain last year were valued at 1.3
billion U.S. dollars, according to statistics provided by the
Spanish Trade Commission here.
</P>
<P>
Looking to the future, the Spanish Commission and the Spanish
Institute for Foreign Trade will continue to enhance links between
Spain, Hong Kong and China's mainland. Efforts will be made to
promote joint ventures with Chinese companies and a number of
trade activities are being planned, including holding a fair named
"Expo Consumo" in the year 2000 in Shanghai, the Spanish
commissioner added.

<HEADLINE> EU Nears Self-sufficiency in Wood, Wood Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The addition of Austria, Finland
and Sweden has given a dramatic boost to European Union (EU)
forestry self-sufficiency, Eurostat reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
After the EU enlargement to include the three countries, said
the Luxembourg-based EU statistical office, per capita forest land
area in the union rose from 0.15 hectares to 0.27 hectares.
</P>
<P>
By almost doubling the forest land to 102,325,000 hectares and
adding the forestry industry in Finland and Sweden, it said, the
15-nation union is now 91 percent self-sufficient in sawnwood.
</P>
<P>
The sawnwood self-sufficiency rate before the inclusion of the
three countries into the regional alliance was 55 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In printing and writing paper, the EU was 118 percent
self-sufficient in 1996 compared with 78 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Finland and Sweden, three other EU member states of
France, Germany and Spain also boast forest land area of more than
10 million hectares, said the EU statistics clearing house.
</P>
<P>
Finland and Sweden are described by Eurostat as key market
players in coniferous sawnwood, woodpulp, paper and paperboard
products as well, with their exports mainly within the union.
</P>
<P>
In roundwood, however, EU self-sufficiency has slightly
diminished as Finland and Sweden import significant amounts of
roundwood from outside the union.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Jute Organization Seeks to Renew Jute Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The International Jute Organization
(IJO) will make efforts to get renewed a U.N. agreement which gave
birth to the Dhaka-based organization, the national news agency
BSS reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The existence of the IJO would be at stake if the International
Agreement on Jute and Jute Products signed in 1982 could not be
renewed before it expires in April 2000, IJO Executive Director
Henri L Jason was quoted by the BSS as saying here Friday.
</P>
<P>
A preparatory committee, comprising all the IJO members, has
decided recently to strongly pursue the extension of the U.N.
agreement for the continuity of the IJO, he said.
</P>
<P>
The extension of the agreement and the participation of India,
which expressed its intention to withdraw from the organization in
May, are necessary to continue the role the IJO has been playing
between jute exporters and importers for the past decade,
according to Jason.
</P>
<P>
And this is essential to consolidate the successes the IJO has
made in research for high-yielding varieties, market promotion,
and diversification of jute and jute goods, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran and a Brazilian state have expressed the desire to join
the IJO, and efforts are being made to get Cote d'Lvoire,
Cameroon, Ghana and Nigeria as new members of the IJO, the IJO
executive director said.
</P>
<P>
The IJO, which is carrying out activities under three sections
- the agriculture, industry, and market promotion, was established
in 1984 to implement the provisions of the international
agreement, which was replaced by a similar agreement in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Interview: HK's Situation "So Far So Good": U.S. Envoy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Richard Boucher, consul-general
of the United States in Hong Kong, said Friday that Hong Kong has
had a "very successful year" in getting off the ground and the
situation here one year after it returned to China is "so far so
good."
</P>
<P>
In a group interview with Xinhua and local media in Hong Kong,
Boucher said that what everybody talked about a year ago was
whether the policies of "one country, two systems", a high degree
of autonomy and Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong could be
successfully implemented in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
But today "we don't discuss (that) much any more because the
answer is so clear," Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
Clearly the Central Government of China has honored its
commitment, Boucher said. "The central leadership had again and
again discouraged any interference in Hong Kong's affairs."
</P>
<P>
The representatives of the Central Government in Hong Kong have
carried out their foreign affairs and defense functions and not
got involved in other things, he said.
</P>
<P>
So, the "one country, two systems" has had a good start in Hong
Kong, Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
"But also the people of Hong Kong, the government of Hong Kong
have demonstrated they can indeed not just handle their affairs
well but cope and act with confidence on some very very difficult
issues," the consul-general noted.
</P>
<P>
"As we approach the first anniversary (of Hong Kong's return to
China), I think we all have to agree that Hong Kong has had quite
a year, but, really, a very successful year in getting off the
ground and coping with the turbulence in the region."

NANCHANG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The water level of the Yangtze
River continues to rise and the banks along the 195-km section
in Jiujiang City in East China's Jiangxi Province faces the danger
of being breached.

<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), today urged actors to engage in concerted
efforts to rejuvenate Beijing Opera.
</P>
<P>
Li issued the appeal during a meeting with members of the
Tianjin Youth Beijing Opera Troupe which staged 10 performances of
traditional Opera in Beijing between June 16-25 in Beijing to
commemorate the first anniversary of the death of Zhang Junqiu, a
great master of Beijing Opera.
</P>

Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
said raising the artistic level depends on carefully prepared
programs, rehearsals and intensive training.
</P>
<P>
He added that high quality performances should be recorded and
offered to the general public via the audiovisual media in order
to expand the social influence of the art and provide economic
returns.
</P>
<P>
Priority should be placed on developing collective wisdom to
enhance the artistic level of Beijing Opera, said Li. He urged the
troupe to analyze the recent performances and take full advantage
of the troupe's collective advantages to stage even more high
quality plays.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Slightly Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar spent the
day struggling to break free from its ties with the besieged
Japanese yen and at the same time managed to gain ground against
the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The volatile local currency stayed above the key psychological
level of 60 U.S. cents despite weakness in regional partners, the
yen and the New Zealand dollar.
</P>
<P>
"There are already signs that the Australian currency is
decoupling from yen," HSBC Markets chief economist John Edwards
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Citibank chief economist Stephen Koukoulas noted the
Australian dollar had edged higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
At the close in Sydney, the Australian currency was at 60.68
U.S. cents Friday from 60.45 U.S. cents previously.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Ted Evans said Australia's currency had been
hurt because dealers wrongly linked Australia to the Asian
economic crisis, but they now appeared to be separating Australia
from the rest of the region.
</P>
<P>
"To align those two currencies makes very little sense at all,
but markets, as I say, look at Asia in total," Evans said.
</P>
<P>
"Interestingly, since the yen began to weaken again in recent
days, that has not been the case, and we've actually strengthened
against the yen."
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar also closed the week at 86.12 yen from
85.11 yen and 1.0906 German marks from 1.0852 marks.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Calls for Economic Coop With S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques
Chirac Friday called for more economic cooperation between France
and South Africa, saying French business was ready to play a
bigger role in the local economy.
</P>
<P>
Chirac arrived in South Africa Friday for a three-day state
visit.
</P>
<P>
In a speech prepared for delivery at the French-South African
Economic Forum in Midrand near here, Chirac lamented France's
weak image in the region and called for increased efforts to
highlight the two countries' strengths to promote more economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said France was Africa's leading supplier and accounted for
about 16 percent of African imports in the last five years --
twice more than Germany and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Africa was also France's second largest market outside the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, accounting
for almost five percent of its total export sales.
</P>
<P>
Noting that trade between South Africa and the rest of the
continent had doubled since 1994, Chirac said fears that France
and South Africa would become rivals on the continent were
unfounded.
</P>
<P>
"Our two countries do not compete but complement each other in
Africa. Fir, because South Africa's areas of excellence in
Africa differ significantly from ours.
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, because our geographical focus differs, France's
position is especially strong in north and west Africa. South
Africa continues to focus primarily on southern Africa, which
accounts for two-thirds of its African exports, and to a lesser
extent, on east Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said bilateral assistance to South Africa, independent
of the aid channelled through the European Union, amounted to
half a billion Rand (90.1 million U.S. Dollars). This was more
than most other assistance from the international community.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the volume of French export sales to South Africa
rose by 27 percent compared to the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, French investments in South Africa came to more
than three billion Rand (545 million Dollars), reflecting the
interest of French companies in the country and their confidence
in its future, he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Accord on Banana Import Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) agriculture
ministers agreed Friday on the tariff rate for both tariff quota
and autonomous quota of banana imports.
</P>
<P>
Containing changes proposed by the European Commission (EC),
the executive body of the 15-nation union, the accord was
finalized after four days of intensive debate.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler described the accord as
both fully respecting EU's World Trade Organization obligations
and ensuring EU consumer and producer interests.
</P>
<P>
Under the new document, the EU's tariff quota of 2.2 million
metric tons of banana import would remain unchanged at a tariff
rate of 75 European currency unit (ECU) per ton.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, said an EU spokesman, the tariff rate for the
autonomous quota of 353,000 tons of banana imports would also be
fixed at 75 ECU per ton.
</P>
<P>
It is now up to the EU council of ministers' decision about the
tariff rate for the autonomous quota, otherwise the rate could
vary a great deal, said the official spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The EC proposed a cut of tariff rate for the autonomous quota
from 300 ECU per ton to 75 ECU per ton as a support for the banana
producers in the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) region.
</P>
<P>
Banana-producing countries in the EU like France and Spain,
however, were promised an increase in aid for their growers.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia Friday asks the
international community to put pressure on the Eritrean
authorities to respect the rights of Ethiopian citizens who are
living presently in Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The office of the Ethiopian government spokesperson says in a
news release issued here that more than six hundred Ethiopians
have been detained in Eritrea since the border conflict began in
early May.
</P>
<P>
"Though they have committed no offense they continue to be
exposed to the worst form of torture, atrocities and inhumane
treatment and are denied the freedom to leave Eritrea," the
office states, adding that "the Red Cross and journalists have
been denied access to them and their families have had no news of
them since they were rounded up and imprisoned in the early
stages of the conflict."
</P>
<P>
The office calls on the international community to put
pressure on the Eritrean side to allow access to these detainees
and to push for their release and safe conduct to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The office continues to say that well over 4,000 Ethiopians
were arrested, some were beaten and tortured, their property was
confiscated and they were driven to the border with Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"Some were deprived of their medical treatment in the
process," said the release.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement made by the office last week, the
Ethiopian government had held 140 Eritrean national conscripts at
a center in the town of of Fiche, about 100 km north of Addis
Ababa for reasons of national security.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Calls for Constitutional Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
said Friday debate on the need to revamp Zimbabwe's constitution
should be done within and outside the ruling party to come up
with a draft document to be put to the people in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe told the 34th ordinary session of ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) central
committee that the aim of the government was to get view points
from the party as well as those of others to ensure the new
constitution would be coming from the people, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"I hope and trust that our legal and constitutional committee
has now done enough preparatory work on the subject of amending
the present constitution so discussion can start soon," said
Mugabe, who is ZANU-PF's first secretary.
</P>
<P>
The president urged other political parties and interested
organizations to "have the freedom" of enunciating their own
beliefs and view points.
</P>
<P>
"This is so that whatever definite and positive issues emerge
are included in a proposed constitutional document to be put to
the people at a referendum, since it is now agreed among us that
this be the mode of securing national acceptance or rejection of
such a document," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Civic organization, under the National Constitutional
Assembly, have since last year started consulting people on the
need for total reform.
</P>
<P>
Several legislators have also openly spoken on the need to
revamp the constitution.
</P>
<P>
"If democracy is to thrive and become a national heritage,
then the nation's political course to change government or its
leadership can only be that of an orderly democratic process as
prescribed by our constitution," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
He again blamed social disturbances in the country over price
increases on the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, the workers
and tertiary and university students.
</P>
<P>
The president also castigated some leaders within the party
"who, for their own ambitious reasons, have wished for, and
indeed have clandestinely given support to anti-government
activities that have the makings of instigating mass uprisings."

<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China is waging a nationwide
campaign to crack down on illegal publications, with the effort
including the destruction of millions of pirated VCDs, tapes and
illegal publications over the past few days alone.
</P>
<P>
For example, south China's Guangdong Province destroyed some
2.8 million pirated VCDs on June 15 as part of what was reportedly
the country's most extensive effort to eliminate pirated VCDs.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, the Chinese capital, has also maintained tight
controls on illegal publications, with over 150,000 pirated VCDs
and 100,000 illegal books and periodicals destroyed on June 16 and
17.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin has destroyed more than 60,000 pirated VCDs and
numerous illegal publications, while Chongqing has destroyed
150,000 pirated VCDs and 200,000 illegal books and periodicals.
</P>
<P>
Shangdong Province has joined in the effort by destroying some

<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of people queued in front
of Beijing's Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution at
06:00 this morning to await the opening of National Anti-Drug
Exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Cui Guangwei, an official with the China National Petroleum
Corporation, stood in the queue with his family. "Many of my
colleagues have visited the exhibition and agree to the
instructional benefits of the event. My entire family came early
to see for ourselves." said Cui.
</P>
<P>
Deng Ming, a member of the organizing committee, said the
exhibition, the largest of its kind since the founding of the
People's Republic of China in 1949, has attracted more than half a
million visitors since opening on May 29. He noted that the event
was extended for an extra month in answer to the strong demand.
</P>
<P>
"Over 250,000 people reserved tickets on the day following the
announcement of the extension," said Deng.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Chinese news media exhibited unprecedented
enthusiasm for publicizing of the exhibition has made the
event a hot topic of discussion amongst the general public.
</P>
<P>
Deng stressed that the anti-drug effort requires the support
and understanding of people from all walks of life. He noted that
people from all circles have expressed concern over the issue and
praised the tremendous success of the exhibition.

"Visitors will help disseminate related information to every
corner of the nation and the exhibition will become a milestone in
the history of China's anti-drug campaign," according to Cui.
</P>
<P>
One American visitor commented, "I'm impressed with the courage
the Chinese people have exhibited by sponsoring such an
informative anti-drug exhibition. The exhibition demonstrates the
Chinese government's determination to continue the anti-drug
drive."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the profound significance of the exhibition will
most likely surpass all expectations of the organizers since many
young visitors will reject drugs after visiting the event.
</P>
<P>
"The exhibition will quite likely change the destiny of
many promising young people," according to the American.
</P>
<P>
Organizer Tang Xiaoxing reported that more than 800 visitors
attending the first day of the event wrote notes praising the
heroic deeds of personnel involved in the anti-drug effort and
pledging to help family members and friends remain drug free.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the Ministry of Public Security has printed brochures
providing information concerning over 3,500 items on exhibit and
has in turn distributed copies to all counties and cities as part
of an effort to ensure that more ordinary citizens have the
opportunity to learn about the great hazards involving the misuse
of drugs.

NANCHANG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangxi Province
will face even more severe flood conditions due to continuing
heavy forecast for the region.
</P>
<P>
Water levels along the Yangtze River and its tributaries
continue to rise on a daily basis and are already well above
warning levels. All reservoirs are filled to capacity and many are
releasing excess water into drainage areas.
</P>

The province has witnessed heavy flooding due to torrential
rains which have hit the region since June 12. Flooding has
affected over seven million residents and destroyed some 200,000
rooms, in addition to disrupting traffic on 170 highways.
</P>

A report issued by the Provincial Health Department reports
that flooded areas remain free of major outbreaks of endemic
diseases and food poisoning. However, numerous cases of diarrhoea,
colds and skin infections have been reported.

<P>
The report indicated that 800-odd medical teams staffed over
5,000 personnel have distributed more that 10,000 kilograms of

<HEADLINE> President Clinton Arrives at Diaoyutai State Guesthouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
his official delegation arrived at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse,
where they will stay while in Beijing, at 9:14 (local time)
this evening.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to the United States Li Zhaoxing and his
wife accompanied President and Mrs. Clinton to the guesthouse from
the airport.
</P>
<P>
Staff members of the state guesthouse presented bouquets of
flowers to the president and Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton and his delegation on Thursday arrived in
Xi'an on the first leg of his nine-day state visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Building No.18 of the guesthouse, which serves as residence of
visiting heads of state to China, was refurbished last March.
According to a source with the guesthouse, President Clinton has
come with a big official delegation. "We have made everything
ready for the arrival of this large party and will do our best to
render them first-rate service," the source said.
</P>
<P>
Diaoyutai, meaning "fishing terrace," was once an imperial
mansion with a history of more than 800 years. The Chinese
government in 1959 turned this place into a state guesthouse to
accommodate leaders of various countries who came to attend the
celebrations of the tenth anniversary of new China.
</P>
<P>
With the ancient Diaoyutai garden as the mainstay, the complex
which now has 19 villas of different architectural styles is a
high-grade venue for receiving high-ranking state guests.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Raises Water Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Singaporeans will pay more money
for domestic water consumption from next month as the government
is mounting on more efforts to slow down the growth of water
consumption.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Trade and Industry Lee Yock Suan announced Friday
that the water tariff, including the water conservation tax, will
be increased by up to 24 Singapore cents per cubic meters for home
users with effect from 1 July.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement when he launched the "Save Water
Campaign" this year.
</P>
<P>
This is the second rise since last year in what will be a
series of four annual increments on 1 July 1997, 1998, 1999 and
2000, which target water tariff at 1.52 Singapore dollars (about
0.92 U.S. dollars) per cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The present water tariff rate is 73 cents per cubic meters and
the water conservation tax rate stands 10 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The minister said there will be no increase for non-domestic
consumers as they are already paying close to the target rate of
1.52 Singapore dollars per cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the waterborne fee, which goes towards
treating waters and sewerage facilities, will also be raised by 5
cents per cubic meters for domestic consumers and 10 cents per
cubic meters for non-domestic users starting on the same day.
</P>
<P>
The minister said water consumption has been rising fast with
the annual growth rate increasing from 4.2 percent in 1996 to 5
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The domestic sector, which accounts for about half of the water
consumption, registered a 3.3 percent increase in 1997 compared
with a 0.9 percent rise in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Noting Singapore is an island country with scarce water
resources, the minister said the government has adopted a
two-pronged approach: first by pricing water correctly; and
secondly by getting the public to make it a habit to conserve
water.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the economic downturn, we must press on with our water
conservation efforts and raise water tariffs and conservation tax
as planned," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Drug Education Proposed in Pre-Marriage Courses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's National Anti-Drug
Council is proposing that anti-drug curriculum be incorporated in
pre-marriage courses in the country, Deputy Home Minister Ong Ka
Ting said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The council proposed that Muslim and non-Muslim couples be also
taught about measures against having drug-dependent children in
the family later, he said.
</P>
<P>
Because parenting skills have long been ignored, the council
proposed that state Islamic affairs departments incorporate
anti-drug curriculum in pre-marriage courses for Muslim couples,
he said.
</P>
<P>
As for non-Muslim couples, the deputy minister said the
National Registration Department, which also registers marriages,
should conduct such courses.
</P>
<P>
"Being parents is not an easy task in this modern era. We tend
to totally let the school take care of our children while we are
so preoccupied with eking out a livelihood. I think this is no
longer suitable with the present challenges," he was quoted by
Malaysia's national news agency Bernama as telling reporters after
a function in Kuala Kerai in the northern state of Kelantan.
</P>
<P>
Ong also urged the Civil Defense Department to adopt a
front-line role in the fight against the drug menace, especially
in educating the people on the perils of drug-abuse as well as the
preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
Today is the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit
trafficking, with the theme "Youth Uniting to Prevent Drug Abuse"
for this year.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Malaysia's National Association for the
Prevention of Drug Abuse meanwhile urged all Malaysian youths to
unite and reject drugs to achieve the government target of a
drug-free Malaysia within 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The association's Vice President Lee Lam Thye said in a
statement issued Friday that as the future leaders of the nation,
Malaysian youths must be fully equipped to face multiple
challenges and be free from drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
Lee suggested that all schools intensify drug prevention
educational campaigns and include more anti-drug programs in their
extra curricular activities.
</P>
<P>
He said all youth organizations in Malaysia should give
priority to drug abuse prevention programs by setting up anti-drug
units and organizing more awareness campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Lee also suggested that non-governmental voluntary
organizations work together with government agencies to organize
and implement anti-drug abuse programs involving youth and youth
organizations.

have been instrumental in expanding the friendly contacts," said
Ye.

<P>
The religious beliefs of foreigners in China are respected and

freely visit designated mosques and churches.

<P>
Beijing's religious organizations honored the requests of the

delegates to the Fourth World Conference on Women. Related
organizations extended great efforts to provide delegates with
convenient access to temporary religious venues.
</P>
<P>
"Today's world is beset with racial disputes and religious
conflicts. Fortunately, however, China enjoys harmonious and
stable religious conditions," said Ye, adding that related

SINGAPORE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Share prices picked up a bit on
Singapore stock market Friday as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index (STII) gained 15.76 points to close at 1,085.59
points.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the boost, led by property stocks, was encouraged
by unconfirmed rumors that the much-anticipated off-budget
measures to be announced Monday would revive the beleaguered
property market.
</P>
<P>
But they said Friday's late lift in sentiment was not
representative and the off-budget measures are still expected to

<HEADLINE> Employees of Nepal Airlines on Hunger Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Employees of the Royal Nepal
Airlines Corporation (RNAC) including pilots resumed their
domestic flights Friday after a one-day strike Thursday, but they
started a relay hunger strike instead to pressure the management
to meet their demands.
</P>
<P>
The relay hunger strike took place on the RNAC premises and
will last three days after talks between the Employees
Coordination Committee and the management failed.
</P>
<P>
The committee threatened to launch stronger protest programs if
its demands are not met by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Employees Coordination Committee presented an ultimatum to
the chairman of RNAC on June 11, demanding hiring of planes on
lease-purchase basis instead of short-term leasing of aircraft
from foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
The committee also demands the immediate formulation and
implementation of new regulations and ending of financial
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
The national flag carrier of Nepal has only two Boeing 757 jets
and has a Boeing 737 on a short-term lease.
</P>
<P>
For years, the airlines officials have been alleged with
pocketing huge commissions on the leases while the airlines runs
with a loss of 180 million rupees (2.7 million U.S. dollars) on
the domestic route alone.
</P>
<P>
"The management is ready to solve the problem through talks,
but they should resume work," said K.B. Poudel, spokesman of RNAC.
</P>
<P>
The strike has not affected the airlines' international
flights.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Manufacturing Output Drops In May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's manufacturing output
declined by 4.5 percent in May this year compared to the same
month of last year, the Economic Development Board said in a press
release Friday.
</P>
<P>
The EDB said the fall was caused by lower output from the
electronics cluster despite increases in both chemicals and
engineering clusters.
</P>
<P>
Output from the electronics cluster was down by 9.6 percent
from May 1997 with all its major segments, except computer
peripherals and PCBAs, dipping below levels of a year ago, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Weak demand lowered the output levels of personal computers and
telecommunication equipment while the persistent market oversupply
continued to depress the output of disk drives and affect the
semiconductors segment, it added.
</P>
<P>
According to EDB, output of petrochemicals, the top riser among
all segments, grew by 15.7 percent in May thanks to the new and
higher capacities in the industry despite some maintenance
shutdowns. The chemicals clusters registered a 4.9 percent growth,
the pharmaceuticals segment increased by 6.3 percent, and the
petroleum industry grew by 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the engineering sector which only grew 0.6 percent, the
decline in the precision engineering segment was almost nullified
by increases in the transport and processing engineering segment.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Visits Dhaka on South Asian Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A special envoy of United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan arrived here Friday for consultations
with Bangladesh leaders on the U.N.'s possible role in reducing
tension in South Asia in the aftermath of nuclear blasts by India
and Pakistan last month.
</P>
<P>
Alvaro De Soto, U.N. assistant secretary general for political
affairs, is expected to meet Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Part of his mission was to prepare ground for a possible visit
by Annan himself to the region, a press report said.
</P>
<P>
The envoy, who is carrying a letter from Annan for Hasina, is
scheduled to fly to Karachi, Pakistan, Saturday after his one-day
Bangladesh visit.
</P>
<P>
India is against outside involvement in resolving its disputes
with Pakistan, while the latter favors the U.N. or any third party
helping in this regard.
</P>
<P>
India would refuse to receive the U.N. envoy, Indian Foreign
Ministry spokesman Sunil Lal said Thursday, according to reports
reaching here. "They are talking about Indo-Pakistan matters and
Kashmir. You know our stand," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hasina visited India and Pakistan on June 16 and 24
respectively, in an effort to mediate between her country's two
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
As the first foreign head of government to visit the two
countries after their nuclear explosions, Hasina was given a warm
welcome at the airport by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif,
and in New Delhi, she had to confine her talks with her Indian
counterpart, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, on bilateral relations, reports
said.

<HEADLINE> Official Cites Policies Protecting Tibetan Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Ye Xiaowen, director of the State
Bureau of Religious Affairs, today described claims that the
traditional culture in Tibet is dying as nothing more than "pure
lies".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at today's press conference, Ye said the Chinese
government has adopted a series of policies to promote the
development of ethnic cultures and ensure they receive proper
respect.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Constitution and the law governing the regional
autonomy of ethnic minorities contain special articles stressing
the protection and development of ethnic cultures, said Ye.
</P>
<P>
The central government has extended great effort to protect,
restore or preserve precious cultural relics and restore buildings
in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The central treasury has allocated a total of 300 million yuan
(37.5 million US dollars) since 1980 to repair and restore
cultural relics, including the world-famous Potala Palace, and the
Johkang, Baiqoi and Samyai monasteries. The government has also
funded the construction of a temple to commemorate the 10th
Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
The well-known 62-part Tibetan folk epic "King Gesser" has been
compiled and published in the Tibetan language. The Chinese
Tripitaka in both the Chinese and Tibetan languages and various
other Tibetan religious classics have also been released,
according to Ye.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 institutes for Tibetan studies are distributed
throughout the nation and the Tibetan language is taught and
widely used in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Certain people seem to derive pleasure out of creating lies
and spreading rumors," said Ye. adding that "rumors and lies never
succeed in distorting reality."

<HEADLINE> Israel Frees 60 Lebanese Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel freed 60 Lebanese prisoners
Friday and handed over 55 of them to Lebanon through the
International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) as a part of the
swap of prisoners and body parts between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The other five prisoners chose to remain in their prisons for
personal reasons, the ICRC said.
</P>
<P>
At midday, leaders of the country's anti-Israeli Shiite Muslim
groups went to the Kfar Falous crossing near Lebanon's southern
biggest city of Sidon, which links the Israeli occupied-zone in
south Lebanon and the rest of the country, and officially took
delivery of the 55 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The freed detainees, most of them from the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, were bused to Beirut by the ICRC.
</P>
<P>
The swap, the second between Hezbollah and Israel in two years,
includes the exchange of the body parts of Israeli sergeant Itamar
Iliya for 40 bodies of Lebanese guerrillas and the release of the
Lebanese prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The remains, not including the scalp, of Iliya and 40 bodies of
Lebanese guerrillas were exchanged on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Iliya was one of the 12 Israeli soldiers killed in a botched
Israeli commando raid on the Lebanese southern village of
Insariyeh last September.
</P>
<P>
Most of his body parts were held by Hezbollah and Amal is
holding his scalp.
</P>
<P>
Amal refused to hand back the scalp as the group disagreed with
Israel over the number and names of the prisoners to be released.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that a mass funeral procession will be held for
the 40 killed guerrillas within days at the Great Prophet mosque
in the capital's southern suburbs, a stronghold of Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip
in south Lebanon since 1985 with the claimed aim to protect its
northern areas from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is spearheading a war against Israeli occupation
forces and their allied South Lebanon Army.

<HEADLINE> 200 AIDS Babies Born Each Day in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- At least 200 HIV-positive
babies are born in South Africa each day and it is estimated
that, within the next 10 years, up to three million children
could be infected or orphaned by the epidemic, The Star daily
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
AIDS specialists agree that about six percent of all babies in
South Africa are born with HIV.
</P>
<P>
The Health Department confirmed that 1.3 million babies were
born last year, which means that 78,000 babies were born
HIV-positive, or 214 a day.
</P>
<P>
Most babies contract the AIDS virus from mothers who are
HIV-positive, during birth or through breastfeeding, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
AIDS consultant Clive Evian said: "About 20 percent of women
who give birth in public health hospitals are HIV infected. One
out of four women then pass it on."
</P>
<P>
He said 30 to 40 percent of the babies died within the first
year.
</P>
<P>
Daya Moodley, senior research scientist at King Edward
Hospital in Durban, said the hospital recorded about 12,000
births a year, and 28 percent of the mothers were HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
Glenda Gray, director of Chris Hani Baragwanath's perinatal
HIV research unit, confirmed that, of the 20,000 women giving
birth at the hospital in a year, 4,000 were HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
Last year the Health Department undertook the eighth in a
series of unlinked, anonymous surveys of women attending
antenatal clinics of the public health service. Of 12,343
specimens screened, 1,976 (16,01 percent) were infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
HIV (human immuno-deficiency virus) leads to full blown AIDS
(acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome).
</P>
<P>
Every day, about 1,200 new HIV infections are recorded among
adults, mostly in the 15- to 49-year age group.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic places a strain not only on the health system but
also on the welfare system as hundreds of thousands of children
are orphaned by the disease.
</P>
<P>
Gray said the country would need thousands of hospices to
treat AIDS children. "We need clear guidelines on how to take
care of them. A model for some form of home-based care is going
to be essential," she said.

<HEADLINE> Water Weed in Lake Victoria Reaches Crisis Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The water hyacinth, which is
currently covering 4,000 hectares on Lake Victoria, have reached
the crisis level, Uganda's National Environment Management
Authority (NEMA) said.
</P>
<P>
Aryamanya Mugisha, the NEMA deputy director, issued the
warning Thursday at a one-day sensitization seminar on
environmental management here.
</P>
<P>
"The water hyacinth problem has reached an environmental
crisis level now covering over 4,000 hectares of Lake Victoria
with 70 percent of the lake shoreline in Uganda covered," he was
quoted by Friday's Monitor paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the lake is estimated to contain over 1.25 million
metric tonnes of the weed and the situation is worsening because
another 3.5 million tonnes of the weed are currently flowing from
River Kagera in western Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The floating of the weed has hampered the country's power
generation and fishing activities.
</P>
<P>
The Owen Falls Dam in Jinja, which is located some 80 kms east
of Kampala and is generating 70 percent of the 230 megawatts of
electricty the country needs, has to take immediate measures to
clear the large stretches of water hyacinth hampering the
operation of the machines.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen's boats are sometimes barred from going out to the
lake or returning to the landing sites because of the weed,
dramatically reducing the their daily fish catches.
</P>
<P>
On the same seminar, Minister of Water, Lands and Environment
Henry Muganwa Kajura told the army officers to become the pillars
of "green peace" in the country.
</P>
<P>
He urged soldiers to put up coordination units in each
division to coordinate environmental protection activities.

LUANDA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Jonas Savimbi, Chairman of the
opposition National Union for Total Independence of Angola, will
come to live in the capital city of Luanda.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of UNITA Lukamba Gato made it public in the
central city of Andulo where UNITA's headquarters is located,
the Angolan News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Gato said that as the leader of the biggest opposition party,
Savimbi will reside in the political center of the country
so as to better lead the activities of UNITA.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the UNITA cadres holding positions in the
newly-established local governments at various levels to go to
their posts as soon as possible to carry out their
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Cease-fire does not mean peace for all, Gato said, adding that
the true realization of peace needs such criteria as national
reconciliation, mutual acceptance between the two warring sides,
mutual accommodation, justice and democracy.
</P>
<P>
He said that UNITA has made great efforts for the achievement
of peace, including demobilizing 70,000 fighters, incorporating
nine generals into the national army and putting 273 areas
formerly controlled by it under the governance of the Angolan
government.
</P>
<P>
UNITA will continue its efforts to help resolve the pending
issues in the peace process in line with the 1994 Lusaka Peace
Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution on June 12,
saying that U.N. will impose sanctions upon
UNITA on June 25 if the opposition group refused to surrender the
four "sensitive areas", Andulo, Bailundo, Nharea and Mungo to the
government by June 23. The sanctions include freezing savings
abroad of UNITA and its leaders and banning its export of diamonds.
</P>
<P>
At a peace process joint committee meeting later, UNITA expressed
its willingness to hand over the four areas, but a few days later
than the U.N.-set date.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the U.N. Security Council held
meeting Wednesday, postponing until July 1 the date of imposing
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council said that the sanctions would be in force
from four a.m. (gmt) on July 1 if UNITA refuses to surrender the
four areas unconditionally.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Foreign Reserves Hit 7.58 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's foreign reserves
increased to 7.58 billion U.S. Dollars last year from 4.07
billion U.S. Dollars in 1996, the Central Bank of Nigeria has
announced.
</P>
<P>
In its latest issue of annual report available here Friday,
the bank said, "The restrained monetary stance pursued during
the year and appropriately supported by sustained fiscal prudence
contributed to the deliberation of the inflation rate from 29.3
percent in 1996 to single digit level of 8.5 percent in 1997."
</P>
<P>
Aggregate production, measured by gross domestic product at
constant prices, rose by 3.8 percent in 1997, compared with 3.4
percent in the previous year. But it fell below the 5.5-percent
target, the bank said in the report and its statement of
account for the year ended in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the slow economic growth mainly to
low-level of investment, deteriorating infrastructural
facilities, persistent fuel scarcity, incessant power cuts and
inefficiency of other public utilities.
</P>
<P>
As for the performance of the bank itself, a surplus of 2.31
billion Naira (some 269 million U.S. Dollars) was attained in the
bank's financial operations last year, compared with 275.3
million Naira (about 3.21 million U.S. Dollars) in 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government announced
Thursday a further cut of 100,000 barrels per day in its crude
oil production as part of international efforts to stabilize oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
With the announcement, Nigeria's daily oil output now stands
at 2.033 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria in March this year cut its production by 125,000
barrels per day, in the face of a falling oil price.
</P>
<P>
The new reduction in production, part of the 2.6 million
barrels per day agreed upon by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), was announced at the on-going OPEC
meeting in Vienna, Austria, Nigeria's Petroleum Resources
Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new reduction will take effect from next month and will be
valid for one year.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Releases 17 More Political Detainees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has ordered
the release of 17 more political prisoners and detainees 11 days
after the release of nine detainees.
</P>
<P>
David Attach, the Chief Press Secretary to Head of State
General Abdulsalam Abubakakr, announced this in a statement in
Abuja Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the release of the detainees was
carried out in "furtherance of the new administration's
determination to strengthen the process of national
reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
Among the released detainees are Chief Lou Falae, former
Secretary to the Government of the Federation; Alhaji Abubakar
Rime, former Kano State Governor; Olisa Agbakoba and Segun
Maiyegun, human rights activists.
</P>
<P>
Others are Frederick Fasheun, former presidential aspirant in
the Social Democratic Party (SDP); Alhaji Sule Lamido, former SDP
chieftain; Ayo Opadokun, chieftain of the opposition group the
National Democratic Coalition.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, General Abubakar also appealed to the
released to reciprocate this gesture on keeping the peace and
contributing positively to the national reconciliation process.
</P>
<P>
On June 15, the Nigerian government announced the release of
nine political detainees, including former head of state General
Olusegun Obasanjo. Others are labor union and opposition
leaders, human rights activists and journalists.
</P>
<P>
The goodwill gesture has been welcomed both in and outside
Nigeria, and led to the thawing of the diplomatic ice between
Nigeria and the West.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair have both called Abubakar on the phone, expressing their
appreciation of the new leader's reconciliation efforts and urged
him to carry on the transition to democracy process.
</P>
<P>
A European Union delegation headed by British Foreign Minister
Tony Lloyd arrived in Nigeria Thursday afternoon and is expected
to meet General Abubakar Friday.
</P>
<P>
Upon arriving at the Lagos airport, Lloyd said that he will
discuss with Abubakar about EU sanctions, the democratization
process and air ban, among other issues.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Adopts Plan to Tackle Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has approved an
action plan to ensure the country's readiness for the year 2000
millennium bug, Y2K.
</P>
<P>
The plan, approved by the cabinet Wednesday, also paves the
way for introducing anti-dumping legislation for non-compliant
equipment and software, the report said, Business Day paper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Posts, Telecommunications and Broadcasting Minister Jay Naidoo
said Thursday that the government will urgently examine
regulations to ensure dumping in this area does not happen.
</P>
<P>
If necessary, new legislation against dumping of non-compliant
equipment and software will be introduced, he said.
</P>
<P>
The action plan, drawn up by the National Year 2000 Decision
Support Center (National Y2K Center), would ensure that 68
"mission-critical" systems within government are totally ready by
2000, Naidoo said.
</P>
<P>
The government could not afford to have these systems fail,
which includes those for pensions, examinations, housing
subsidies and transport, he said.
</P>
<P>
Assessment and analysis, planning, integration, testing and
implementation of the plan designed to save these systems will be
carried out under the guidance of the National Y2K Center.
</P>
<P>
Announcing that August 19, the 500th day before January 1,
2000, had been declared a national Y2K awareness day, Naidoo said
a meeting of all national and provincial directors-general would
be convened by the deputy president's office to ensure
implementation of the plan.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide survey showed that 70 percent of government
departments and 90 percent of large organizations anticipated
completing their conversions on time, Naidoo said.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of local authorities would also be ready,
although the figure excluded "embedded" systems within local
authorities, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Naidoo said the "low-level of readiness" among
government departments are of concern. A much bigger proportion
of government departments and local authorities lack adequately
skilled projects teams and adequate action plans compared with
that of large organizations.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges New Tests on Warheads Unearthed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 26 (Xinhua)-- Iraq has urged new tests on the
missile warheads unearthed in Iraq, which the U.S. army laboratory
alleged containing VX nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Iraqi Television Friday, advisor at the
Presidency Office Amir as-Saadi said Iraq demanded new tests be
done on these warhead fragments, and a scientific conference be
held attended by experts from neutral countries to analyze the
results.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported Tuesday that traces of VX nerve
agent were found in samples of Scud missiles warhead fragments
recovered in March from a destruction site at Nibai, north of
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The report was later confirmed by Richard Butler, Chairman of
the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
As-Saadi said that the current allegation will be just like
previous ones released by Butler, which turned out to be false and
wrong.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that VX was not weaponized in any kind of
ammunition," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the UNSCOM for leaking the alleged results
to media instead of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, As-Saadi stressed that Iraq will continue implementing
its commitments toward the UNSCOM on disarmament in Iraq, and will
not stop cooperating with it.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, France to Sign Trade Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and France will
sign five financial agreements worth 335 million Rand (about 60
million U.S. Dollars) during a coming three-day visit by French
President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Chirac is due to arrive at Waterkloof Air Force Base outside
Pretoria Friday morning from Namibia for the second leg of a
six-day Southern African tour, local daily Sowetan reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela will meet Chirac at the
Union Buildings, where they will witness the signing of
agreements on police cooperation, sport and maritime transport.
</P>
<P>
In addition, two more bilateral treaties will be signed by
French and South African ministers later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Namibian sources reaching here said Chirac with a 50-strong
delegation of businessmen, arrived in Windhoek, the capital of
Namibia, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first visit to the country by a serving French
president. The aim of the visit is believed to beef up French
commercial ties, and to expand its diplomatic influence in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, the French head of state said that Namibia,
with a population of just 1.6 million in an area three times the
size of France, was a democratic country where business could set
up in an atmosphere of stability and security.
</P>
<P>
There were a number of development projects of particular
interest to France, particularly agriculture and energy.
</P>
<P>
One in particular which could soon become a reality was a new
bridge over the Zambezi River on Namibia's extreme northeastern
border with Zambia which would open access to central and eastern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma said earlier that his country,
rich in natural resources and minerals, could form a mutually
beneficial alliance with France through Chirac's visit.
</P>
<P>
Chirac will leave for Maputo, Mozambique on Sunday afternoon,
where he will spend 24 hours before visiting Angola to wind up
his southern African visit.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's COSATU Vows Election Support for ANC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Congress of South
African Trade Unions (COSATU) has declared overwhelming support
for the African National Congress (ANC) in next year's general
election, media report here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
At its four-day inaugural central committee meeting ended
Thursday, COSATU endorsed last year's decision not to put up its
own list of candidates, with COSATU members in the government
appearing on an ANC ticket.
</P>
<P>
COSATU and the South African Communist Party (SACP) are in a
ruling alliance with the ANC.
</P>
<P>
COSATU proposed an ANC-COSATU-SACP alliance political council
to exercise final political authority on all issues relating to
the overall transformation of the state and the economy.
</P>
<P>
The federation decided to discuss with the government
extending the elections to two days, to ensure that people in
rural areas were able to vote.
</P>
<P>
The central committee, COSATU's highest decision-making body
between congresses, agreed that each COSATU member would
contribute one Rand to be used by the federation for election
purposes.
</P>
<P>
Union members would also pay a levy, which would be determined
by the federation at its central executive committee meeting, to
be donated to the ANC.
</P>
<P>
The unions would look for other source of finances, including
requests to the unions' investment companies.
</P>
<P>
COSATU resolved to develop a clear message aimed at advancing
its goal of a better life for all.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General Mbhazima Shilowa said COSATU needed to
release its members to go from door to door campaigning for
votes, and to ensure that prospective voters had their identity
documents and were registered for elections.
</P>
<P>
COSATU is opposed to government's Growth, Employment and
Redistribution macro-economic strategy, and has repeatedly
challenged government's labor retrenchment policy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki urged COSATU
to ensure that the ANC was returned to power with an overwhelming
majority in next year's election.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Urges United Position Against Israel's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat
sent urgent letters from Ramallah, West Bank on Friday to Arab and
Islamic organizations, urging them to take urgent measures to
protect the holy city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat sent his urgent letters to King Hassan II of Morocco,
Arab League Council and the presidency of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference, asking them to adopt a united Arab and
Islamic position to encounter Israel's expansion scheme in
Jerusalem, according to Jerusalem Media and Communication Center
(JMCC).
</P>
<P>
He decided to send the urgent letters after chairing a
Palestinian leadership meeting Thursday night in Ramallah which
discussed the latest political developments in light of the
dangerous crisis in the peace process, because of the Israeli
policies of expansion in Arab East Jerusalem and other settlements
in the occupied territories at the expense of the Palestinian
lands, JMCC said.
</P>
<P>
Israel announced last Thursday its Jerusalem expansion plan,
under which the Ma'ale Adumim and other Jewish settlements in the
West Bank will be included into Jerusalem municipality.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians strongly criticized the plan, saying that
it is a declaration of war against the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat met Friday in Ramallah with an Israel Arab
delegation, during which he said that Israeli expansion measures
in Jerusalem area blatant violation of international resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Head of the delegation Adbul Wahab Darawshe, who is also member
of the Israel's Knesset (parliament) from the United Arab List
which has four Knesset members, told Arafat that his party is
against the Jerusalem expansion plan and will try its best to
prevent it from implementing.
</P>
<P>
JMCC's another report said that from Friday morning, Israeli
authorities closed the northern entrance to Ramallah district of
the West Bank, banning Palestinians from entering or leaving
through that entrance without giving reasons.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli authorities also erected checkpoints near Beit El
settlement on the way between Ramallah and Nablus, another West
Bank city, on the way to Birzeit town and near Attara Bridge.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership comprises executive members of
the Palestine Liberation Organization and the cabinet members of
the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
Arafat accepted resignations of the cabinet ministers on
Wednesday pending for a cabinet reshuffle. But all ministers have
become care-takers of their respective ministries till the new
cabinet is formed.

resources and long-term welfare of the people in pursuit of
economic gain. Rapid economic growth will be based on
environmentally-sound environmental and energy efficient
approaches.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection is placed at the top of China's
sustainable growth strategy, with investments in related efforts
expected to hit 180 billion yuan (21 billion US dollars) within
three years, according to Xie Zhenhua, director of the State
General Administration of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
Immediate pollution control targets centers on three rivers --
Huaihe, Haihe and Liaohe, and three lakes -- Taihu, Chaohu and
Dianchi in Jiangsu, Anhui and Yunnan provinces, as well as the
capital city of Beijing. China is also carrying out a project to
control acid rain and sulfur dioxide on 1.09 million sq.km., or
11.4 percent of the nation's total land area.
</P>
<P>
China launched more than 700 afforestation projects as part of
its effort to establish a so-called green "Great Wall". The goal
of the program is to prevent soil erosion and ecological
deterioration.

Stringent measures have also been introduced to protect
valuable land resources needed to feed China's population of over
1.2 billion people. The government encourages farmers to practice
ecological farming which ensures the efficient use of land and
natural resources and offer good economic returns.
</P>
<P>
Construction sites have consumed vast stretches of China's
147 million ha of arable land at an alarming rate in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
China encourages the efficient use of energy during economic
development and attaches great importance to achieving
technological advancement which promotes the cost-effective use of
natural resources. Investments in technological transformation
projects are expected to top 170 billion yuan, and the
construction of nuclear power and hydropower projects is gaining
momentum.
</P>
<P>
Local leaders have gained a greater sense of the importance of
sustainable growth and more municipalities, provinces and
autonomous regions have increased spending on environmental
protection. Shanghai, the nation's largest industrial center,
alone plans to pump 70 billion yuan into environmental and
ecological protection projects by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Observers note that China, a developing country with low per
capita natural resources, faces an arduous task in promoting
coordinated economic and social growth. Nonetheless, they stress
that the long-terms benefits involved deserve relentless
efforts.

<HEADLINE> Registering Religious Rendezvous Meaning No Limitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Ye Xiaowen, director of the State
Bureau of Religious Affairs, said here today that the Chinese
government requires the registration of religious organizations
and sites for religious activities in order to protect normal
religious activities and ensure the legitimate status of sites
for religious activities, rather than as a means of limiting
religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at today's press conference hosted by the Information
Office of the State Council, Ye said it is the general practice in
many countries to require social organizations to register with
relevant government departments.
</P>
<P>
In China, the regulation covering the registration and
administration of all social organizations, including religious
organizations, requires such bodies to register with government
civil affairs departments, said Ye, adding that China has more
than 3,000 registered religious organizations.
</P>
<P>
He said Chinese religious believers account for about 10
percent of the total population, and noted that legal measures
must be used to effectively ensure their right to conduct normal
religious activities. Ye added that the registration system has
won support from the country's religious sector.
</P>
<P>
The registration of sites for religious activities has also
proceeded smoothly according to law since 1994, said Ye.
</P>
<P>
About 85,000 places of worship had registered with the
government in accordance with the State Council's Regulations on
the Administration of Sites for Religious Activities by the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Ye pointed out that concerned government departments fully
respect the characteristics of various religious beliefs during
the registration process.
</P>
<P>
For example there are no registration requirements for what
Chinese Christians refer to as "home services", or religious
activities which relatives and friends attend to pray and study
the Bible. Ye stressed that the government in no way interferes
with or limits normal activities.

about the material used and craftsmanship adopted in the making of
these warriors.

Earlier, President Clinton and his wife Hillary visited the
Xiahe Village on the outskirts of Xi'an this morning.
</P>
<P>
With its 1,300-plus people, the village just about one
kilometer away from the site of the terra-cotta warriors, has been

foliage of a tree in front the court of a farmer's household.
Among the local participants at the talk are a farmer, a primary
school teacher, a restaurant manager and a college student.
</P>
<P>
Addressing on the topic of "China's Changes and I", the
participants answered questions raised by Clinton and his wife.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a brief speech at the village primary school,
President Clinton said he had learned that local farmers have
adopted to the advanced farming techniques and so they can spend
more time on traveling, making arts and crafts and engage in other
trades.
</P>
<P>
He said he was pleased to see that the villagers now have TV
sets and telephones and set up a primary school, and the life of
the villagers has been improved as people elsewhere in China.

<HEADLINE> NPC Standing Committee Approves Two Laws (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China's highest legislative body
today approved the Law on Doctors, the Laws on Exclusive
Economic Zones and Continental Shelves and various other important
proposals.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), presided over this afternoon's
meeting and delivered a speech to members of the NPC Standing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Approval of the Law on Exclusive Economic Zones and Continental
Shelves is highly significant for enabling the country to
effectively safeguard its sovereignty and jurisdiction over seas
and marine resources, said Li.
</P>
<P>
The Law on Doctors urges Chinese medical personnel to
improve their skills and professional ethics, as well as protect
their legitimate rights, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the NPC Standing Committee deliberated the draft
revision of the Land-Use Law which was preliminarily deliberated
during the second meeting of the Standing Committee in April.
</P>
<P>
The existing Land-Use Law is regarded unsuitable for the
current market economy and ongoing reform.
</P>
<P>
The coverage of farmland has continued to shrink in recent
years, with various localities wasting valuable land and natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
In order to effectively curb the misuse of farmland, the
revised Land-Use Law will effectively curb the misuse of farmland
by strictly controlling the different uses for agricultural,
construction and idle land.

</P>
<P>
Members of the Standing Committee approved the reports and
tabled suggestions on macro-control of the economy and reform of
the taxation system.
</P>
<P>
The country must work diligently to surmount difficulties

<HEADLINE> Full-Time Farm Workers on Drop in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Full-time agricultural workers
decreased by 125,000 people, or 1.8 percent, on European Union
(EU) farms last year, Eurostat said Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, said the Luxembourg-based statistical office of the
European communities, the fall was less than the longer-term trend.
</P>
<P>
Earlier figures show that average annual fall in the EU's
agricultural labor volume was 3.8 percent between 1986 and 1991,
and 4.0 percent between 1991 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to 1997, the number of agricultural full-time labor
equivalents fell from an estimated 12.6 million to 6.9 million.
</P>
<P>
The falling trend of full-time farm workers was mainly
attributed to the falls in France and Italy, where the labor
volume was down 2.5 percent and 1.4 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Italy accounts for one fourth of the total EU agricultural
labor volume while France accounts for 15 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Farm worker decrease was also witnessed in Germany, Greece,
Spain and Portugal that combine to account for another 40 percent
of the EU agricultural labor volume.

<HEADLINE> French President Visits S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques
Chirac arrived in South Africa Friday for a three-day state
visit.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela hailed Chirac as an old
friend, saying Chirac's current visit, the first of its kind, to
South Africa will strengthen their bonds.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said at a joint news briefing after talks with Chirac
that France was the first European country he visited after his
release from prison.
</P>
<P>
"I have known President Chirac when he was mayor of Paris.
Every time I went to France, I also saw Chirac."
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he did not view Chirac's southern African trip as
a departure from France's involvement with its former colonies in
west Africa.
</P>
<P>
"I would not talk of departure, but of continuation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's four-nation southern African tour comes less than a
year after France introduced changes in its Africa policies, away
from involvement in its former African colonies.
</P>
<P>
The new policy recognizes that South Africa has become a
cornerstone for new investment and growth in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said France's long-standing relations with western
African countries would not change, but it was important for it
to also strive for relations of friendship, partnership and trust
with the countries of southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
"This will start with South Africa, which is the real engine
for the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about progress in trade talks between South Africa and
the European Union, Chirac said the negotiations were drawing to
a close.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that a free trade agreement would be
reached before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in South Africa, Chirac is scheduled to meet
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, National Assembly
Speaker Frene Ginwala as well as other officials.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economists Say That Stabilizing The RMB Is The Right Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Tang Min of the Asian Development
Bank and Zuo Xiaolei of the Philippines' Asian Administration
College say in today's "Economic Daily" that a depreciation of the
yuan would quite likely spark a round of depreciation of other
currencies in Asia and that stabilization of the Chinese currency
is the best choice.
</P>
<P>
Since last July, the currencies in Asian countries have
depreciated by 40 to 70 percent against the U.S. dollar during the
financial crisis, producing a bad effect on China's economic
development, especially on its exports.
</P>
<P>
Exports of most of these countries have declined instead of
increased after the devaluation, so China may not get the effect
of enhancing competitiveness on the international market even if
it really depreciates the renminbi, Tang and Zuo, both Chinese
working overseas, say.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a stable rmb will help safeguard economic
and financial stability in Hong Kong which is essential to
maintaining exports, attracting more overseas investment and
making better use of international finance.
</P>
<P>
They say that Hong Kong's prosperity and stability are an
important way to sustain economic development in China's interior,
so aid to Hong Kong is aid for the interior.
</P>
<P>
A stable rmb will also help maintain overseas investors'
confidence in China, so that maintaining a stable rmb is China's
contribution to the Asian economy and it is in China's own
economic interest because it hopes to have an eight percent growth
this year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: "One Country, Two Systems" Takes Roots in HK (1) By Feng Xiuju </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- "One country, two systems" is
generally believed to have taken roots in the heart of people here
since Hong Kong became a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of
China on July 1 last year.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with this principle, Hong Kong enjoys a high
degree of autonomy and retains its own separate legal system,
complete with its court of final appeal. Hong Kong's previous
capitalist social and economic systems and way of life remain
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law, Hong Kong residents enjoy freedom
of speech, of the press and of publication; freedom of
association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that from last July 1 to March 31,
there had been over 1,260 public demonstrations in Hong Kong and
626 societies formed.
</P>
<P>
Backed by the 6.5 million Hong Kong people, the government of
the Hong Kong SAR headed by Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa has
done its utmost to ward off the economic difficulties brought on
by the year-long Asian financial turmoil and maintained Hong
Kong's stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Under the "one country, two systems" principle, Hong Kong
retains its status as an international financial, trade, shipping
and information center and one of the safest cities in the world.
</P>
<P>
As the world's busiest container port for six consecutive
years, Hong Kong handled about 14.6 million twenty-foot equivalent
units (TEUs) of containers in 1997.
</P>
<P>
At the end of May this year, Hong Kong's foreign exchange
reserve totaled 96.4 billion U.S. dollars, ranking third in the
world and first on a per capita basis.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been regarded as the second among the cities with
competitiveness in the world, according to a report issued by the
World Economic Forum in this month.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 1996, the overall crime rate and violent crime
rate in 1997 dropped by 17.3 percent and 12.4 percent
respectively, the lowest in 24 years.
</P>
<P>
All this shows that the "one country, two systems" concept
first put forward by the late Deng Xiaoping is working well in
Hong Kong. Even those who doubted whether the principle would be
implemented before Hong Kong's return to China have come to
realize that this principle is "scientific, practicable and
successful".
</P>
<P>
To a certain degree, the key to turning the "one country, two
systems" concept into reality depends on the full implementation
of the principles of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" with a
high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
As Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa put it, "The Central People's
Government has granted us a high degree of autonomy -- a situation
that is unparalleled anywhere in the world."
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, since the Hong Kong SAR was established a
year ago, not a single official has been sent by the Central
People's Government to the SAR government which was formed in
accordance with the relevant stipulations of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government has fully respected the SAR government
in the belief that the Hong Kong people are bound to administer
Hong Kong well.

<HEADLINE> "One Country, Two Systems" Not Applicable to Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Ye Xiaowen, director of the
State Council's Bureau of Religious Affairs, said at a
news conference today that the "one country, two systems"
principle is being used to resolve the Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan
issues, but cannot be applied to Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Tibet was peacefully liberated in 1951 and completed democratic
reform in 1959 and has had regional autonomy like other ethnic
minority areas in China since then, Ye said, and the principle
does not fit there.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama has claimed that he would no longer seek Tibet
independence, but that Tibet should have a "high degree of
autonomy". In reply, Ye points out that the Dalai Lama has
actually switched to a two-step process for Tibetan independence.
</P>
<P>
The first step is a "high degree of autonomy", through which he
could restore control over over Tibet, and the second is Tibetan
independence, or what he calls "a political system edging up
towards independence."
</P>
<P>
Ye pointed to the many cruelties Tibetans suffered under the
serf system and said that only after serfdom was abolished, did
the Tibetan people begin to enjoy the political rights guaranteed
by the Constitution and the regional autonomy of ethnic minorities
law.

<HEADLINE> China Protects Normal Religious Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese citizens enjoy full rights
to freedom of religious belief, according to Ye Xiaowen, director
of the State Bureau of Religious Affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Religious believers are free to participate all normal
religious activities in temples, mosques, churches or homes,"
said Ye.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that enjoying the right to freedom of religious
belief, citizens must also carry out duties prescribed by law.
</P>
<P>
"A handful of religious believers in China have been punished
for their illegal activities or crimes in recent years, and the
punishment of criminals in accordance with the law has absolutely
nothing to do with religious belief."
</P>
<P>
Ye told a press conference here today, "the Chinese government
maintains that every country should respect the characteristics of
other countries and promote mutual understanding through dialogue,
while opposing any interference in the internal affairs of other
nations under the pretext of religion".
</P>
<P>
Ye noted that about 10 percent of China's total population
belongs to various religions, including Buddhism, Taoism, Islam,
Catholicism and Protestantism.
</P>
<P>
The nation's over 85,000 places of worship are staffed by over
300,000 religious personnel. China is home to 3,000 national and
local religious organizations and 74 seminaries which have
graduated more than 5,000 students and have current enrollments
totalling 4,000 students.
</P>
<P>
"Religious believers enjoy the same political rights as people
from other walks of life," said Ye.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some 17,000 religious personnel serve either as
deputies to people's congresses or committee members of political
consultative conferences at various levels.

<HEADLINE> China, US See Increasing Legal Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China's Minister of Justice Gao
Changli told Xinhua today that the cooperation in law between
China and the United States is growing and said that efforts to
increase exchanges and cooperation will continue.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have cooperated extensively in the education
of law, he said, and, since 1986, the East China University of
Political Science and Law and American universities have had a
training program on China's legal system that has trained more
than 700 American lawyers and law students.
</P>
<P>
China has invited 200 legal scholars from the United States to
lecture in China in the past decade and Chinese universities have
established ties with about 20 American law schools.
</P>
<P>
A graduate program will be started next year by the China
University of Political Science and Law and the U.S.'s Temple
University, granting degrees for students upon graduation.
</P>
<P>
Gao said that the China-U.S. symposium on economic law in China
in 1987 had several hundred lawyers, bankers, and business people
from the United States and started cooperation between the two
countries' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
He says that Chinese and American lawyers have cooperated
extensively in stocks, fund raising, domestic and overseas
investment, intellectual property rights, marine business, and
protecting the rights of Chinese and American citizens and legal
persons, and that 21 American Law firms have set up offices in
major Chinese cities like Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Haikou,
and Qingdao, and 5 Chinese law firms have offices in New York,
Chicago, Washington D.C., and Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Cut Government Expenditure: Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira
said on Thursday night that the Macao Government will cut its
administrative expenditure and suspend some public engineering
projects in the face of economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The Government Information Office quoted the governor as saying
after returning from a working visit to Portugal that because of
the economic difficulties in the wake of the Asian financial
turmoil, the government will trim its budget and suspend some
public engineering projects.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that a budget reduction proportion will be
announced soon for all government departments, but there will be
different reduction proportions for different departments.
</P>
<P>
However, the governor said there will be no cut in the salary
of civil servants.
</P>
<P>
Macao has been affected by an economic slow-down since
1993. But the Asian financial storms have made it worse. Tourist
arrivals and exports, two of its leading income makers, have
dropped substantially over the past several months.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Expert Helps Reclaim Chinese Desert Into Oasis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Seiei Tohyama, a Japanese expert
who is presiding over a Chinese reclamation project, has expressed
his confidence that "people are able to turn a desert into an
oasis."
</P>
<P>
The 92-year-old Japanese agriculturist who specializes in
desert reclamation has taken the challenge of the incurable
"cancer on earth" -- the Kubch Desert in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region in north China.
</P>
<P>
He said ambitiously that he will turn the Kubch Desert into an
oasis on which 200,000 people at least will be able reside.
</P>
<P>
Tohyama began his desert reclamation work in 1990 in Engbey,
located in the recesses of the Kubch Desert, with a Chinese
businessman named Wang Haiming.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese expert, who had successfully reclaimed 420,000
hectares of desert in Japan, said the 21st century will be a epoch
of desert development, and that it is vital for humans to handle
desert reclamation programs well .
</P>
<P>
With painstaking effort in the past eight years, two million
trees have been planted in Engbey, 100,000 hectares of grassland
cleared; and two reservoirs built.
</P>
<P>
Wang Haiming, who is director of the desert development
exemplary zone of Engbey, said afforestation is just the basis of
their comprehensive development plan, and that their ultimate aim
is to develop a multi-industry chain on the desert.
</P>
<P>
Engbey has more than 2,000 head of fine goats that are bred by
Xu Gorigan, a scientist of Mongolian nationality. The goats yield
an annual output worth nearly 1 million yuan (120,000
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Engbey called back the ostrich that lived on
the Kubch Desert 30,000 years ago, and invited the 47 peafowl from
south China. An ostrich eggshell sells for as much as 300 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Besides growing grain, vegetables and herbs, the Engbey
developers have imported and planted flower seeds from Japan, and
they expect to profit from selling the reproduced flower seeds
back to Japan.
</P>
<P>
The farming industry has been basically mechanized in Engbey
and advanced agricultural techniques have been introduced there.
</P>
<P>
To make full use of the tourist resources in Engbey -- such as
sand, forests and animals -- the developers formed a tour company
and built hotels several years ago, said Wang, adding that Engbey
receives nearly 10,000 tourists each year.
</P>
<P>
The desert lacks water, but a mineral water factory was
established in the Engbey development zone. Its product sells well
in cities nearby.
</P>
<P>
Several research institutes in the country are now carrying out
cooperative programs to develop farming and animal-raising
techniques in Engbey, said Wang, adding that an electronic company
and a motor company of Japan intend to develop
solar-energy-powered automobile there.
</P>
<P>
"If there is enough funding, we can build Engbey into a Silicon
Valley of farming and animal-raising in China," Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Construction of Macao-Zhuhai Bridge to Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Macao and neighboring Zhuhai
authorities in south China's Guangdong Province will launch the
construction of a link bridge separately next Monday, the Macao
Government Information Office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
To be named "Lotus Flower Bridge" after the symbol on the flag
of the future Macao Special Administrative Region, the bridge will
connect Macao's Taipa Island and Zhuhai's Hengqin Island.
</P>
<P>
The 1.3-kilometer-long bridge will open a second land crossing
apart from the existing border gate to China's inland, after it is
completed in about 15 months before the handover ceremony on
December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
There will be a ribbon-cutting ceremony on each side of the
bridge next Monday. The two sides share the costs of the bridge of
200 million patacas (about 25 million U.S. dollars). The bridge
will have six traffic lanes.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the bridge was decided by the
Sino-Portuguese Infrastructure Coordination Commission (SPICC)
earlier this month. Chinese Officials described the bridge as
important for both Macao and Zhuhai.
</P>
<P>
"It will help improve Macao's outward land transportation
conditions and facilitate the development of Macao's islands and
Zhuhai's Hengqin Island," Xie Houhe, chief of SPICC Chinese
delegation, said earlier.
</P>
<P>
The SPICC is now considering construction of some other
infrastructure projects by the two sides. Further discussions will
be made on the projects including the extension to Macao a
Guangzhou-Zhuhai railway.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: SAR Officials Impressed by Practice of "One Country, Two Systems" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- As the first anniversary of the
Special Administrative Region's (SAR) inauguration is approaching,
senior SAR government officials wrote articles or gave
interviews, speaking of what they have felt and what they have
done during the year.
</P>
<P>
These articles and interviews were carried Friday in a
four-page special column on Wen Wei Po, a major Chinese newspaper
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang in his article said that Hong
Kong's development during the past year fully accorded with what
the Basic Law stipulates, that is, Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong with a high degree of autonomy. "This is an obvious fact for
all to see," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong residents are also deeply impressed by the fact that
the country will support and encourage us, if required, but will
never interfere, said Tsang.
</P>
<P>
"The relationship of mutual trust can help us develop a sense
of belonging toward our country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong's economy has been battered by the
regional financial turmoil since August last year and it is
inevitable that Hong Kong will go through a period of adjustment.
</P>
<P>
"We Hong Kong people still have to face some tough days ahead
until we can see the light at the end of the tunnel," he remarked.
He also made it clear that the SAR government will overcome the
adversities along with the Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the successful practice of "one country, two
systems" in Hong Kong, Secretary for Electoral Affairs Michael
Suen said in an interview: "Time has proved everything."
</P>
<P>
Before the handover, there had been concern about interference
from the Central People's Government in Hong Kong's affairs. But
what took place in the past year fully demonstrated that the
promises of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" have been put into practice in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to Lily Yam, commissioner of the Independent
Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), the ICAC has continued its
dependent and effective work against corruption since July 1,
1997.
</P>
<P>
The confidence of Hong Kong people in ICAC has been maintained
at a very high level, while various regional and international
surveys still ranking Hong Kong as one of the most cleanest cities
in Asia, Yam said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for the Civil Service Lam Woon-kwong said, as a
senior civil servant, he has a deep impression about the
implementation of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
One example is that expatriate civil servants in the SAR
government obtained approval from the Central People's Government
to attend international meetings as members of the Chinese
delegation. The pragmatic approach demonstrated the country's
determination to safeguard Hong Kong's long-term interests, Lam
said.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the improvement brought up since the handover in
two aspects: one is that there is no longer time and space
limitations in formulating policies, the other is that
cross-border cooperation is becoming institutionalized.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner of Customs and Excise Lawrence Li Shu-fai said,
Hong Kong remains a separate customs area after the handover and
his work is basically unchanged except for more frequent use of
the Chinese language.
</P>
<P>
As a Hong Kong Chinese, it's a pleasant thing to work for the
SAR government of China, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Music Continues After Handover for Chan by Wang Qun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Here in Hong Kong, a dynamic and
diverse metropolis, everyone has his or her way of life. For Chan
Yim-pao, bread earner of a family of four, Chiu Chow music is
his way of life.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of his leisure time is devoted to Chiu Chow music, a
branch of traditional Chinese music which is not so popular in the
city.
</P>
<P>
In the words of his teenage daughter Chan Hei, "My father is
just crazy about that music."
</P>
<P>
Chan, 44, was first fascinated by the beauty of Chiu Chow music
when he was very young. At his hometown, a tiny fishing village
on the coast of Fujian Province, he used to play the music with
friends at a store for self-entertainment. "Those happy days are
kept deep in my memory," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
He settled down in Hong Kong in 1983 and founded a label
company in 1989 with some 30,000 HK dollars (nearly 4,000 U.S.
dollars). The mini-company with two machines is located in his
flat in the old industrial district of Kwun Tong, Kowloon, and
Chan is the only worker. The company's good record of fast
delivery of products earns it a few committed customers.
</P>
<P>
Chan could never forget the early days of his company. At that
time, he and his wife were still working in a carton factory. They
made the best use of every minute of lunch time to call on garment
manufacturers based in Kwun Tong, sending out name cards and
waiting for response.
</P>
<P>
Finally came orders. "I worked at night. Sometimes I had to
work overnight to finish it. The second day I still went to the
carton factory," Chan recalled.
</P>
<P>
Nearly round-the-clock work left no time to music. Fortunately
their business got on the track very soon. Chan and his wife left
the cartoon factory, putting all the energy on their small
undertaking.
</P>
<P>
And Chan picked up erxian string, his favorite instrument in
Chiu Chow music, again. Every morning, he gets up early and does
a one-hour solo at home; when night falls, he goes out to play
with partners.
</P>
<P>
He was proud of his band, grouping "top players" in Hong Kong.
"In the run-up to the handover last year, British Broadcasting
Corporation visited our playing venue at Sheung Wan, shooting the
scene for a program about life in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Now one year has passed. As an immigrant who has been well
integrated into the Hong Kong community, Chan said he noticed no
significant change in his life since that specific date.
</P>
<P>
"Even before the handover, I had never worried much about it,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's very natural for Hong Kong to return to her motherland,"
said Chan, who returns to his hometown "at least three times a
year" for traditional Chinese festivals.
</P>
<P>
For Chan, life continues, music continues.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Hong Kong Family Tied With Putonghua by Chang Kefei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Life is as usual for the Sin
family nearly one year after the handover on July 1, 1997, when
Hong Kong reverted from British rule to become a special
administrative region (SAR) of China.
</P>
<P>
Sin Kam Wai, husband and father of the family, continues to
teach Chinese at a secondary school -- a stable and well-paid job,
especially in the economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
His wife Susan So, a welfare worker, still takes care of a
"small group home", which has eight children in need of parental
care.
</P>
<P>
Their two daughters Fong and Annie, both in the early 20s, go
on with their study at college in New Zealand, and fly back to
Hong Kong every year for summer vocation.
</P>
<P>
The husband and wife said that there was nothing different with
their life and work after the handover. "Almost everything is the
same," they said, "except that more and more people begin to learn
Putonghua."
</P>
<P>
Sin is also principal of Hong Kong Putonghua Society, a
non-government, non-profit organization devoted to the promotion
of Putonghua, the standard spoken Chinese. For the last two
decades, he has seen a burgeoning Hong Kong population, who
usually speak English and Cantonese, learn Putonghua.
</P>
<P>
The society now enrolls about 20,000 students a year, while it
only took several hundred per year in the early days. Sin
explained that the "Putonghua heat" was fueled by close economic
intersection and frequent personal exchange between the mainland
and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Susan added that Hong Kong schools now open Putonghua courses
for students at lower grades and increase the number of courses
per week.
</P>
<P>
She said that the eight children she looks after all take
Putonghua lessons at school.
</P>
<P>
Susan has been playing the role of "mother" at the "small group
home" for three years, and accordingly her husband acts as the
"father". They live together with the four boys and four girls,
aged between 6 and 17, who lack parental care due to family
problems or mental handicap. Their home is one of the 12 sponsored
by the International Social Service Hong Kong Branch.
</P>
<P>
Susan, who used to be a kindergarten teacher, told Xinhua: "We
try to provide them with a normal family, and establish a sense of
trust with them."
</P>
<P>
"It is a challenging work that need love and patience, but it
is truly rewarding when I see them regard me as their mother and
let me know everything about themselves," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I love kids, and I hope they can all grow up to be good and
healthy persons," said Susan, who took up the job three years ago
when her daughters went to college in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
"My daughters were surprised to find that they could use
Putonghua on the foreign land, to communicate with their Chinese
classmates from Malaysia and Taiwan," said Sin, who encouraged
them to learn Putonghua in childhood. Fong and Annie now speak
fluent Putonghua, Cantonese and English.
</P>
<P>
During the Christmas last year, the Sin family traveled to
Beijing and were impressed with many places of interest. "We want
our children to know more about the Chinese people, the culture
and the language," said Sin.

<HEADLINE> Slovak Bank Opens First China Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Vseobecna Uverova Banka of
Slovakia opened a representative office in this financial and
trade center of China Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a Slovak bank opened an office in
China.
</P>
<P>
Founded on the basis of a state bank of the former
Czechoslovakia in January 1990, Vseobecna Uverova Banka was
restructured into a joint-stock bank in 1992 with state-owned
foundations holding a 51 percent stake and collective and private
investors the remaining 49 percent. The bank had 4.9 billion US
dollars in total assets by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Jan Gabriel, the chairman and president, said that Vseobecna
Uverova Banka is optimistic about China's economic prospects.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the Shanghai office is intended not only to
provide services to the Chinese banking community, enterprises and
the public, but also to help boost economic and trade cooperation
between Slovakia and China, said Gabriel, who was here to attend a
ceremony marking the opening of the representative office.
</P>
<P>
Besides the new office, the Slovak bank has two more overseas
offices, in Moscow and London.

<HEADLINE> China Using Donations To Help Handicapped People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The China Welfare Fund for the
Handicapped, China's leading foundation of its kind, has said that
domestic and overseas donations for disabled people are being used
properly.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and overseas organizations and individuals gave 6.6
million yuan (800,000 US dollars) last year, which became part of
the foundation's 1997 budget of 10.59 million yuan for welfare
work for the handicapped, the foundation reported today.
</P>
<P>
More aid has come in the form of cooperative programs. Lions
Club, the worldwide charitable organization, for example, financed
cataract operations. These programs used an estimated 20 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The foundation allocated large sums for paying the interest on
loans to handicapped people for starting businesses, and to create
employment, education, and rehabilitation opportunities.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 disabled people found jobs, more than 60,000
received rehabilitation training, and 350,000 cataract patients
had their eyesight restored through operations last year.
</P>
<P>
China has at least 1,500 schools for handicapped children.
Over 60 percent of the enrolled are handicapped children.

<HEADLINE> HK Newspapers Welcome Clinton's Visit to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong newspapers published
commentaries Friday, welcoming U.S. President Bill Clinton's first
state visit to China starting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ming Pao Daily News, in a commentary entitled "Sino-U.S.
cooperation benefits the whole world", said this forthcoming
summit, closely following Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to
the U.S. last October, is a clear indication that the Sino-U.S.
relations are developing and improving, which is beneficial to the
efforts of Asia and the world as a whole to move into the next
millennium in a stable and peaceful fashion.
</P>
<P>
A commentary published by Hong Kong Economic Times said Clinton
brought some concrete gifts for his China tour, such as relaxing
restrictions on U.S. high-tech exports to China and a proposal for
granting China the permanent Most-Favored-Nation status. In
return, China has prepared for the guest a large number of orders
for U.S. aircraft and telecommunications products.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper stressed, the greatest significance and
achievement of the visit will not be these agreements or
contracts, but the visit itself.
</P>
<P>
The visit will be a new landmark in the Sino-U.S. relationship,
marking that their links have entered a new phase based on
understanding and cooperation, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Commercial Daily hailed Clinton's trip as a visit
promoting friendship between the Chinese people and the American
people.
</P>
<P>
There is no denying the fact that the two countries have
differences over many issues, such as human rights and religion,
due to different cultures, history and social systems. However,
what they share in common far exceeds what their differ in.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' recent cooperation in dealing with the Asian
financial turmoil fully demonstrates that their cooperation not
only accords with the interests of the two countries, but also
benefits the stability and development of Asia and the world, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Global future in their hands", an editorial of Hong
Kong Standard, a major English newspaper in Hong Kong, said that
Clinton pointedly referred to two of the vital matters which
"affect not merely Sino-U.S. relations but also the peace and
security of Asia" -- the Korean peninsula and South Asia -- in his
speech soon after arriving in the ancient city of Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
"Not referred to but almost certainly to be taken up when Mr.
Clinton meets Mr. Jiang in Beijing will be the regional financial
crisis and the stability of the Japanese yen, both of which are
playing havoc with the economies of Asia, including Hong Kong,"
said Hong Kong Standard.
</P>
<P>
"These are matters the two leaders must focus on at their
summit; all other issues can be taken up later as Sino-U.S. ties
broaden and deepen. Between friends controversial matters can be
taken up without adversarial overtones; when that stage arrives
many of those issues that now divide will no longer be obstacles
to progress," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The summit "is not just about how these two powerful countries
will relate to each other in the new century, but also what sort
of world they will create for the new millennium," the paper
concluded.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po's Thursday commentary observed that economic and
trade cooperation between China and the United States will do good
to Hong Kong economy, since Hong Kong acts as an entrepot for some
60 percent of Sino-U.S. trade. Besides, the U.S. is Hong Kong's
second largest export market and a major investor in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Looking For Land Use Rights Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A people's deputy today asked
China's top legislature, the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), to pass a law protecting farmers' land
use rights.
</P>
<P>
Xu Xingguan, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
Zhejiang Province People's Congress, said that even though 50-year
contracts for land have been signed by local governments and
farmers all over the country, farmers are still worried about
changes taking place in land policy and are looking for protection
of their land under the law.
</P>
<P>
Xu told today's NPC Standing Committee meeting that
acknowledging the importance of land to farmers during China's
rural reforms and the household responsibility contract system,
which allows farmers long-term rights to land use are crucial and
that some local businesses and institutions have taken over
farmers' land in the name of "public interest", and that many
township enterprises have built factories on farmland without
getting farmers' permission.
</P>
<P>
There should be revisions in the land use law to protect
farmers' rights, Xu said, suggesting that special protection be
given through a national land use plan.

<HEADLINE> China Getting More Handicapped People Away From Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Deng Pufang, the chairman of China
Disabled Persons' Federation (CDPF), China's major organization
for the handicapped, announced today that CDPF will help three
million disabled people living in poverty get adequate food and
clothing this year.
</P>
<P>
Helping them get away from poverty must be the most important
assistance for the handicapped and a key to the country's
poverty-elimination efforts, he said. This is intended to be a
major blow against poverty, something that is vital to 17 million
handicapped people, or about 30 percent of the total number of
handicapped in China.
</P>
<P>
The Federation joined the State Council, the Ministry of
Finance, and the People's Bank of China in April in announcing
that all handicapped people living in poverty will have adequate
food and clothing by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
They will encourage handicapped people to make money with
businesses, breeding livestock or poultry, or making
handicrafts. Funds and technical training will be provided by the
government and organizations.
</P>
<P>
"Most of them can work and become prosperous. But they are
often ignored and can't get help because of physical deformities,"
Deng explained. China's central and local governments provided
more than 200 million yuan in special loans last year to help 1.08
million handicapped people get away from poverty, he told a
meeting of the executive council of the China Welfare Fund for the
Handicapped, of which he is chairman.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 disabled people got jobs and more than 70,000
started their own businesses last year, Deng said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Frees 60 Lebanese Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel handed over 60 Lebanese
prisoners Friday to Lebanon through the International Committee
for the Red Cross (ICRC) as a part of the swap of prisoners and
body parts between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At midday, leaders of the country's anti-Israeli Shiite Muslim
groups went to the Kfar Falous crossing near Lebanon's southern
biggest city of Sidon, which links the Israeli occupied-zone in
south Lebanon and the rest of the country, and officially took
delivery of the freed prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The freed detainees, most from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God, were bused to Beirut by the ICRC.
</P>
<P>
The swap, the second between Hezbollah and Israel in two years,
includes the exchange of the body parts of Israeli sergeant Itamar
Iliya for 40 bodies of Lebanese guerrillas and the release of the
60 Lebanese prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The remains, not including the scalp, of Iliya and 40 bodies of
Lebanese guerrillas were exchanged on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Iliya was one of the 12 Israeli soldiers killed in a botched
Israeli commando raid on the Lebanese southern village of
Insariyeh last September.
</P>
<P>
Most of his body parts were held by Hezbollah and Amal is
holding his scalp.
</P>
<P>
Amal refused to hand back the scalp as the group disagreed with
Israel over the number and names of the prisoners to be released.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that a mass funeral procession will be held for
the 40 killed guerrillas within days at the Great Prophet mosque
in the capital's southern suburbs, a stronghold of Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon since 1985 with the claimed aim to protect its northern
areas from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is spearheading a war against Israeli occupation
forces and their allied South Lebanon Army.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Share Prices Continue Rising on Bank Merger News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed higher for the
third consecutive day in Tokyo Friday as the afternoon news report
that the struggling Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB) would
merge with Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. revitalized the market
at the last minute of the day's session.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 77.82 points, or 0.51
percent, from Thursday's close to finish at 15,210.04.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, gained 5.29 points or 0.45 percent to
1,190.82.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese business daily reported in its evening edition that
LTCB and Sumitomo Trust have agreed to merge their operations
possibly by next April.
</P>
<P>
The news is meaningful in terms of easing immediate fears about
Japan's financial system, an analyst at a private financial
institution said.
</P>
<P>
However, traders said that the merger, even if it becomes
formalized, would not erase the problem of how to deal with the
loads of bad loans which are hampering Japanese banks.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,334 issues listed on the First Section, losers
exceeded gainers 569 to 531 despite the Nikkei's rise, with 152
issues remaining unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the Tokyo Foreign Exchange, the U.S. dollar,
which temporarily climbed above 143 yen level, retreated to below
142 yen on the bank merger news.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency was quoted at 141.27-30 yen at 5 p.m., down
from 142.43-45 yen at 9 a.m., and from 142.15-25 yen late Thursday
in New York.

KUNMING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen people found guilty of
drug dealing were sentenced to death in Kunming, the capital of
Yunnan Province in southwestern China.
</P>
<P>
One of them, Li Guogao, had smuggled 3.49 kg of heroin, and
another, Lian Guangjin, had sold 5.2 kg of drugs, according to
local sources.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan's 4,000-km. border runs along part of the notorious
"golden triangle", and since the 1980s, it has been a major
conduit in international drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
During the early 1990s, Yunnan discovered that it had more than
57,000 drug users, the greatest number of all Chinese provinces
and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The province has dealt with 30,000 drug-related criminal cases
in the past seven years and confiscated 25,000 kg of drugs, or 80
percent of the nation's total of intercepted drugs. The number of
drug addicts in the province has been dropping steadily, thanks to
its anti-drug efforts.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Host 50th PATA Conference in 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will host the 50th
annual conference of the Pacific Asia Travel Association or Pata,
the world's grandest tourism event, in the year 2001, Culture,
Arts and Tourism Minister Sabbaruddin Chik said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting scheduled for April 22-26 of that year would see
the gathering of 2,000 Pata members comprising chiefs of state-
and city-owned tourism promotion agencies and cruise shipping
companies, among others, Sabbaruddin told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
"The participants would discuss current problems facing world
tourism and draw up strategies to meet the members' demand to
secure a competitive edge in marketing tourist products and
destinations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sabbaruddin said the theme "Blazing the Tourism Trail in The
New Millennium" has been chosen for the 50th Pata conference.
</P>
<P>
Preceding it, Malaysia would also host the 13th Pata Chapters
World Congress over three days starting April 18, 2001, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pata, set up in 1951, now has 2,100 member organizations in the
hospitality industry world-wide, including 101 government-run
tourism agencies as well as those of states and cities. Its other
members are 17,000 individuals and chapters.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia had hosted the 1972 and 1986 Pata conferences and the
two events prompted the establishment of the Tourism Development
Corporation and the Culture, Arts and Tourism Ministry
respectively to develop Malaysia's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Sabbaruddin said he is confident that the 2001 Pata conference
would again highlight Malaysia's position as the region's top
tourist convention venue.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Economic Growth Slows Down in Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 26 (Xinhua)-- The economic growth rate in Vietnam
in the first six months of this year was officially estimated at
6.6 percent, lower than the planned target of 9 percent, according
to the Vietnam Economic Times Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Times quoted the General Statistics Administration as
saying that Vietnam's industry production grew by 12.6 percent,
agricultural production up about 2 percent, and state budget
revenue, 4.5 percent, as compared with last year's corresponding
period.
</P>
<P>
The country's export in the period valued at 4.56 billion
U.S. dollars, which was 9.3 percent up from that of the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese officials attributed the slowdown of economic growth
to the natural disasters the country is facing and the current
financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Over the first six months of the year, Vietnam has coped with
great difficulties caused by fierce natural disasters and adverse
impacts of the on-going financial crisis in the region," Minister
of Planning and Investment Tran Xuan Gia told a conference earlier
this week to review the socio-economic situation.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Prime Minister Phan Van Khai also asked the
officials attending the conference to discuss measures to overcome
all difficulties and challenges, further promote the process of
institutional renewal, resolutely practice thrifty, and flexibly
manage macro-economy in order to prevent possible decline in
socio-economic development.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Compensated For Damage Caused By Tiger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Four farmers in China's Jilin
Province were paid 1,000 yuan (120 U.S. dollars) each in
compensation by the local government for cows that were eaten by a
Siberian tiger in the Changbai Mountains earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Three of the four filed a lawsuit against the local government
last month demanding compensation for three cows eaten by a wild
male tiger, and they all say they are satisfied with the local
government's decision in this landmark law suit.
</P>
<P>
One of them said that they will take a more active part in
wildlife protection but also take better care of their cows.
</P>
<P>
Yang Shihe, the secretary-general of the Jilin Wildlife
Protection Association, says that the fact that the special
compensation case was dealt with so rationally probably will have
a positive impact on wildlife protection.
</P>
<P>
Wu Songlin, the mayor of Jiaohe where the incident occurred,
explains that the government paid 70 percent of the farmers' loss,
in accordance with national and provincial law.
</P>
<P>
He said the case shows farmers' increased awareness of the law
and the need for environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Since August of 1997, at least 12 cows have been eaten by wild
tigers in the Changbai Mountains.

<HEADLINE> Traders Imitating Their Successful Ancestors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Standing in the gateway of his
restaurant, Mao Guowei greeted his guests warmly. Just like his
successful ancestors, Mao is capable and good at trading.
</P>
<P>
He quit his job a few years ago with a government department
and opened the restaurant in the ancient city of Pingyao in north
China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
"The reputation of my ancestors does me a favor in business,"
said Mao, recalling one of his ancestors, Mao Honghui, who opened
China's first bank 170 years ago.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the 19th century, Mao's ancestors and their
fellow villagers built a financial network across the country, and
they even had businesses in Russia, Mongolia, Japan and Korea. At
that time, Pingyao and neighboring regions developed into a "Wall
Street" of Far East.
</P>
<P>
"Though my ancestors were quite rich, they left us little,"
said Mao, explaining that most bankers and traders declared
bankruptcy upon the invasion of foreign forces in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
Impoverished and without resources, the descendants of veteran
financial tycoons led hard lives in local dark cave dwellings for
nearly half a century.
</P>
<P>
"Things have changed so much today," murmured Mao, gazing from
the balcony of his new apartment at a group of cave dwellings
close to collapse in the distance. He and his family left the
caves about 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Like Mao, most local residents today engage in business, and
some of them have become China's major coal producers. Latest

In the daytime, Mao and his wife take good care of their

In the southern part of the city are many larger, old-style
houses, each with a beautiful yard, which hint at the luxurious
lives of their owners a century ago -- grand banquets, dazzling
jewelry, beautiful dresses, and coming and going in carriages and
cars.
</P>
<P>
City residents redecorated these houses in accordance with
their original styles and sold items left by their ancestors,
including antiques, paintings and old-fashioned furnitures,
drawing large numbers of overseas tourists. Several state-run
banks were quite busy with daily exchange.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- France registered a 15.41 billion
francs (2.56 billion U.S. dollars) trade surplus in April, up from
12.58 billion francs (2.1 billion U.S.dollars) in March, said the
French Customs on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Export stood at 148.74 billion francs (24.79 billion
U.S.dollars), while import accounted for 133.34 billion francs
(22.23 billion U.S.dollars).
</P>
<P>
France's trade surplus with the 11 countries which will join

<HEADLINE> Big Asian Companies Increase Web Site Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-five percent of the
largest 1,000 companies in Asia have established a presence on the
World Wide Web of the Internet, said the International Development
Corp.(IDC).
</P>
<P>
IDC, the leading U.S. provider of information technology data,
analysis and consulting, said in a new report Friday that this is
up from 57 percent since October 1997 when the firm conducted the
first-ever study of Asian corporate Web site adoption.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, approximately 81 percent of the U.S. companies
with at least 100 employees have established Web sites, according
to IDC.
</P>
<P>
"In just eight months there has been an 18 percent increase in
the number of Web sites created by large corporations in Asia,"
said the IDC report. "The importance of the Internet as a business
tool is rapidly gaining wide acceptance in Asia's corporate
culture, Asia's Web sites have entered a new phase of maturity."
</P>
<P>
Asia's information technology vendors should be encouraged by
the findings, said IDC. Asia's Internet service providers have
recently experienced increasing costs and decreasing income due to
equipment and backbone access fees being charged in U.S. dollars
and subscriber income trickling through in troubled local
currencies.
</P>
<P>
The IDC survey also looked for the ability to complete business
transit through the Web site as well as the quality of Asian Web
sites in terms of layout, navigation, download speeds, ease of
navigation and accessibility. "All areas showed improvement over
the eight month study gap," IDC said.
</P>
<P>
Corporate Web sites in Asia are now showing company financial
information, providing online customer support and using online
registration facilities, according to IDC.
</P>
<P>
IDC believes that the top 1,000 companies in Asia which are
ranked by sales revenues would increasingly use the Web as a
medium for marketing communications and this offers significant
opportunity to vendors of Internet-related products and services.

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Algerian singer Matoub Lounes, who is a symbol of the
culture of the Berber people, was killed by gunman on
Thursday. The assassination, which came on the eve of the
entering into force of a law on imposing the Arabic as the only
language in Algeria on July 5, risked to trigger violence in the
Kabylia region, where the Berber language is used.
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac said on Thursday in Namibia
that France is ready to provide technology in cattle rearing,
fishing, agricultural and food industry, transport and energy to

<P>
-- The European Court of Justice cancelled on Thursday a
decision by the European Commission to allow the French
government to provide Air France with a 20 billion franc (3.3
billion U.S. dollars) aid package. The court ruling came after
seven European air companies, including three British air
companies, presented a complaint on the commission's
authorization. The British Airways said that the ruling means
that the future of European air companies lies in the land of
free enterprises instead of the pocket of tax-payers.
</P>
<P>

injured in an attack on their car in a village in Kabylia on
Thursday. Hated by Islamists and censored by the government,

<HEADLINE> Chinese State Company Trying Multiple Ownerships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A subsidiary of Wuhan Iron and Steel
Corp. was recently given the status of an independent legal
person, a sign that multiple ownerships will be sought to improve
the debt-ridden state sector.
</P>
<P>
The Powder Metallurgical Company, which was a wholly
state-owned enterprise, has been transformed into a stock
cooperative with the parent company holding controlling shares and
workers buying into it.
</P>
<P>
Another 18 of the steel company's state-owned enterprises will
follow suit, allowing non-government sectors to participate in the
reform. "We will encourage different forms of capital operation
methods in the process, such as shareholders' congress, stock
cooperation, merger, combination, and sales," said the steel
company's general manager, Liu Benren.
</P>
<P>
One of China's steel giants, Wuhan Iron and Steel Corp. began
to trim its payrolls in 1992, and has relocated 120,000 workers,
70,000 of whom have been organized to work in non-steel
businesses. However, the lack of independent legal person's status
had greatly limited the sector's further development.
</P>
<P>
Adoption of multiple ownerships will breathe new life into the
reform of state-owned enterprises, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Golf Course Construction Called Excessive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Rolling green golf courses are
picturesque and entertaining, but they eat up too much precious
arable land, experts here claim.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the State Bureau of Land
Administration, China has completed the construction of 58 golf
courses covering 12,266 hectares of land, of which 3,800 hectares
are arable land.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 60 golf courses are under construction and 16 more
courses will be built, which are expected to occupy another 8,000
hectares of arable land.
</P>
<P>
The per-capita arable land in China is 0.066 hectare, one of
the lowest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The golf course projects are mainly located in coastal
developed areas, where the shortage of arable land is more severe.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that with a huge population and inadequate arable
land, China is a country not suited for building a large number of
golf courses.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Destroys Confiscated Narcotic Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AYUTTHAYA (THAILAND), June 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's central
province Ayutthaya Thursday destroyed 632.6 kilograms of seized
narcotic drugs at an incinerator in the province.
</P>
<P>
Anti-drug officials said the involvement of an incinerator
reflected the increasing environmental consciousness of the
Narcotics Control Division of the Public Health Ministry, which
has been conducting such destruction of drugs since 1977.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul attended the destruction
ceremony in Ayutthaya, more than 70 kilometers north of the
capital of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said the destruction, two weeks after
the special session of the United Nations on narcotics, showed the
Thai government's commitment to controlling the use and
trafficking of illicit drugs.
</P>
<P>
Northern Thailand was once part of the infamous "Golden
Triangle", one of the world's major opium producing areas. After
some 20 years of efforts, Thailand has almost eliminated opium
poppy cultivation in its territory.
</P>
<P>
The narcotic drugs burnt Thursday were seized in connection
with 268 cases throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The drugs included 208.1 kilograms of heroin, 170.6 kilograms
of opium, 25.1 kilograms of methamphetamine, 7.75 kilograms of
marijuana, 0.94 kilograms of ephedrine and 0.14 kilograms of
Kratom leaf confiscated by the Public Health Ministry, and 219.9
kilograms of marijuana seized by the Office of Narcotics Board and
the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's drug burning ceremony is the 21st of its kind since
1977. Narcotic drugs destroyed in such ceremonies from 1977 to
1997 amounted to 33,130 kilograms.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Alleges DPRK Submarine on Espionage Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korea said on Friday the
submarine incident caused by the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) is "a clear violation" of its territorial waters and
"an infiltration" violating the armistice and the inter-Korean
basic relations agreements.
</P>
<P>
"North Korea should admit the serious act of aggression, issue
a responsible explanation and take steps to prevent such kind of
recurrence," said Kang Joon-kwon, a spokesman for the South Korean
Defense Ministry in a statement.
</P>
<P>
As the submarine was on an espionage mission, Seoul will ask
for a general-level meeting between the United States troops in
South Korea and the DPRK to discuss the issue, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, a special investigation team of South Korean
military authorities found nine crew dead inside the
submarine. Four of the crew had bullets in their heads and the
other five had bullets in their bodies.
</P>
<P>
The team also found diving equipment, RPG-7 rocket artillery,
an AK automatic rifle, South Korea-made canned beverage in the
submarine and there was no sign of damage to the submarine's
interior.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said it appeared that the crew disagreeed on what
to do after being seized, believing that espionage agents killed
other members before committing suicide under their head's order.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK submarine was caught by the South Korean navy Monday
afternoon after it was spotted entangled in a fishing dragnet in
the East Sea (Sea of Japan), some 11 miles off South Korean
northeastern city Sokcho.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK said Tuesday that the small submarine was wrecked
while on a training mission due to mechanical problems and it was
searching for the vessel and its crew.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Visits Village in Outskirts of Xi'an </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and his
wife Hillary visited a village, about one kilometer away from the
site of the unearthed terra-cotta warriors, in the outskirts of
the ancient city of Xi'an, northwest China, here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Xiahe village with a population of more than 1,300 people
has become affluent thanks to its service to tourists who come to
see the thousands of life-size terra-cotta warriors unearthed in
the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The terra-cotta warriors dating back over 2,000 years in Qin
Dynasty (221-207 BC) in China's history were discovered by local
farmers in 1974 when digging a well.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of their income comes from businesses or
tourism.
</P>
<P>
At ten o'clock this morning, the Clintons came to the Xiahe
Village and were greeted by the village head Yang Yunlong,
villagers and school children.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton and his wife Hillary talked for some 40
minutes with six villagers under a tree, and among the villagers
are a farmer, a primary school teacher, a restaurant manager and a
college student.
</P>
<P>
Focusing on the topic of "China's Changes and I", the villagers
answered questions raised by Clinton and his wife.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a brief speech at the village primary school,
Clinton said he had learned that local farmers have employed
advanced farming techniques so they can spend more time on
traveling, on making arts and crafts and other trades.
</P>
<P>
He said he was pleased to see that the villagers now have TV
and telephone sets and a primary school, and the life of the
villagers has been improved like those in other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Clinton wished the village a brighter future.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the villagers, village head Yang Yunlong extended
warm welcome to the US president and his wife and delegation,
saying that "The president's current visit will help further the
friendship between the people of the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Two primary school children presented bouquets of fresh flowers
to President and Mrs Clinton, who in turn waved the flowers to the
pupils and villagers in acknowledgement.
</P>
<P>
At the end of Clinton's speech, a group of pupils offered a
song entitled "Songs and Smiles". Clinton shook hands with each of
the pupils while Hillary clapped her hands along with the rhythm
of the music.
</P>
<P>
"Please take my song back to your home town, please leave your
smiles here," the children sang their send-off to the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
While the couple was shown around the village, the village life
was as usual: senior villagers sat at their doors of their houses
and some were doing their business while kids were running around,
playing.

<P>
PARIS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Croatia midfielder Prosinecki has said
his team was now setting their eyes on the biggest trophy -- the World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like our team to make it to the quarter-finals. Or, let's be
honest, the final itself," he said Wednesday in Vittel, France.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We could do really well, because we've got the players...
We're mature and whichever teams we meet in the next few games, we're
ready to face any of them."
</P>
<P>
Prosinecki, who plays for Croatian club Zagreb, said nothing was in
the bag despite the fact that they had qualified for the second round.
</P>
<P>
"We have to conslidate and reward all our efforts by winning. It's
vital to stay concentrated and vigilant and give our very best as to
win and finish top of our group."
</P>
<P>
Croatia, who already enter the last 16 along with Argentina, will
meet the former world champions later on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The winners of the game will finish atop group H while a draw will
mean Argentina win the group.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that the match against Argentina is important,"
Prosinecki said. "They are a very strong team and we know what we're
up against. The players belong to the best teams in the world."
</P>
<P>
He added, "For me, this World Cup is the best I've ever seen with a
very high standard. There are no 'lesser' teams. They are all
dangerous."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Learns About China Today in Xi'an Village (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton
and First Lady Hillary visited a village in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province this morning, and had a 40-minute discussion with
local residents about the country's changes in the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
The village, Xiahe, is located on the outskirts of Xi'an, the
capital city of Shaanxi and the first stop of Clinton's nine-day
state visit to China.
</P>
<P>
The six Chinese participants at the discussion include local
farmers, a primary school teacher, an entrepreneur and a
university student. They briefed the Clintons on China's
development based on their own experiences, and answered the
presidential couple's questions.
</P>
<P>
The first speaker, a 20-year-old girl named Fang Fang now
studying in the Xi'an Jiaotong University, talked about China's
educational development and her campus life.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yiquan, a rural doctor at a village clinic, briefed them
on China's efforts on health promotion and epidemic control in
the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Clinton then asked Yang whether he has noticed that the
health conditions for China's rural population are getting
improved.
</P>
<P>
"This surely has happened as our living standards have kept
improving and our physical labor been reduced," Yang replied.
</P>
<P>
The president also asked Yang what he considers poses the
"biggest challenge" for China to improve the people's health
conditions in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
"My decades-long work experience as a village doctor helps me
to realize that it's essential to make greater efforts to maintain
a clean environment, widely spread the knowledge on people's
health, and focus on disease prevention," said the 53-year-old
Yang.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very important issue," said Clinton, adding that
economic development has brought about an ever-increasing pressure
on the environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The president said that China and the U.S. are facing the same
challenge, and need to make joint efforts in the protection of the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yao Lihua, the female manager of a local township
enterprise that makes art handicrafts, recollected how she has
turned into a successful entrepreneur from an ordinary farmer in
the past two decades of China's reform and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
She also told the Clintons that she had personally sponsored a
home for the needy elderlies in the village.

<HEADLINE> Privatization Agency Planned in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will soon establish a
privatization agency to ensure the successful completion of its
privatization program, Cephas Msipa, the Minister of State for State
Enterprises and Indigenization, has said.
</P>
<P>
"Considerable work has already been done to set up the agency
which would be an autonomous unit and would undertake required
strategic analysis of divestiture options," said Msipa Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the establishment of the agency will help to
prepare privatization transactions to develop a positive impact
on the budget deficit and create opportunities for private sector
involvement in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Msipa made the remarks at a two-day institute of directors
seminar on corporate governance to provide insight into the role
of board chairmen, the daily Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government had adopted commercialization before
privatization following its realization to the need to transform
enterprises from deficit-ridden dependent organizations to
credible market driven entities, he added.
</P>
<P>
At independence, the government inherited an economy with
controls and regulations and parastatals which were heavily
subsidized adversely affecting the fisc and creating a high
budget, the minsiter said.
</P>
<P>
Commercialization, he said, was aimed at involving the
disadvantaged groups through the indigenization process in the
productive sectors for essential socio-economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
The seminar will review aspects of corporate governance as it
applies to the (British) Commonwealth countries with a view to
discussing its implementation in Zimbabwe.

"China is expected to have more senior citizens in the 21st
century," said Yao. "I want to display and carry forward the
country's fine tradition of esteeming the elderly through
establishing a home for the aged with my own efforts."
</P>
<P>
People living in Yao's home for the aged average 65 years in
age, with the most elderly reaching 89.
</P>
<P>
"The problem of caring the old is the biggest issue in the
world," said the president, citing the fact that the number of
people aged above 85 years now surges most rapidly in the US.
</P>
<P>
All societies must make efforts to find an appropriate and
decent way to resolve the problem of caring for the senior
citizens, he urged.
</P>
<P>
Yang Dongyi, a self-employed businessman, said that as an old
resident of Xiahe, he has personally experienced three major
changes in the villagers' life since the founding of New China in
1949.
</P>
<P>
"Our living standards had greatly improved first after the
national liberation (in 1949) and then in the early years of the
reform and opening-up. In recent years, greater changes have taken
place in our life," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The average yearly income for his three-member family has now
surged to 30,000 yuan (3,600 US dollars) from mearly 100 yuan
(about 12 US dollars) in 1982, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
However, he went on to acknowledge that there remains a wide
gap between his family and other affluent households in the
village.
</P>
<P>
"The gap will be wider still if our incomes are compared with
those of the farmers in the coastal regions or of the people in
the US. So we need to work harder still," said Yang, now 56.
</P>
<P>
Xiahe has been cited as one of the "model well-to-do villages"
in Shaanxi.
</P>
<P>
Describing China's rapid economic growth in the past two
decades as an "amazing" thing, President Clinton inquired of what
has contributed to the sharp increase of the villagers' incomes.
</P>
<P>
"It's mainly because the government has adopted a good policy,
which has helped emancipate the productive force and given us the
freedom to do what we are good at," Yang replied.
</P>
<P>
Apart from farming, many of his fellow villagers are doing
business or running enterprises, he told the Clintons.

<P>
Liu Lan, a 28-year-old woman teacher with the Xi'an
Experimental Primary School, explained to Clinton on the situation
in China's education.
</P>
<P>
"Since the reform and opening-up policies were adopted in the
late 1970s, the enrollment rate of children eligible for schooling
has greatly increased," she said.
</P>
<P>
"China is now enforcing a nine-year compulsory education system,
which effectively safeguards the healthy growth of our young, and
education is the focus of attention of people from all walks of
life," she said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton asked about the proportion of women teachers to men
teachers in primary schools in China. And she replied that women
account for 70 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Clinton went on to ask how to decide who will have the chance
to go to college upon graduation from high school.
</P>
<P>
"By matriculation exams," Liu said, adding that if the students
failed, they can go to vocational school.
</P>
<P>
The last Chinese speaker was 44-year-old Xie Liming, chairman
of the board of the Xi'an Edelweiss Restaurant, who was once a
service man with the Chinese air force for 15 consecutive years
and later worked in a government institution for another eight
years.
</P>
<P>
However, he quit his government post in 1992 and has now become
the owner of a 500-seat restaurant, which he described as one of
the best eateries in Xi'an, and invited Clinton to eating out
there sometimes when he completes his official government duty.

some American dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he's "working on" the trade issue, and suggested
that Xie invite him when he's not in office and he will very much
like it.
</P>
<P>
At the end of discussion, Clinton said he would like to take
questions.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Yang Yiquan asked why he came to talk to them the
ordinary folks.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton cited this precisely for two reasons: namely,
he said, for "the people in my position," it is important to know
the livelihood of the people and the impact that their policies
insert upon the people's life and, secondly, he noted, because of
his visit, the Americans will be more interested in the everyday
life of the Chinese people. They will come to know how the Chinese
are educated, how you see your doctors and how you run a
restaurant through the visit and news media's reports, he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Put Mao, Deng, Jiang in One Movie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to have Mao
Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin -- representing three
generations of the leadership of the Communist Party of China --
appear in one feature movie for the first time.
</P>
<P>
An official at China's Film Bureau told Xinhua today that the
film, "Dream of the Century," is about the Three Gorges Dam
project which was the result of "brilliant and foresighted
decisions by these leaders".
</P>
<P>
She said the directors will decide whether they should employ
actors to play the three leaders or use documentary clips.
</P>
<P>
Chinese actors have played Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping in a
series of movies. Some of the movies had been shown while Deng was
alive.
</P>
<P>
The new film will be a product of a husband-wife team,
directors Li Qiankuan and Xiao Guiyun, who have made several
expensive films about Mao and Deng in wartime.
</P>
<P>
"Dream of the Century" will be based on historical events,
sources said. The story would begin in 1946 when the Chinese
government employed a U.S. expert to study the feasibility of the
dam, and ends in 1997 when the course of the Yangtze River was
blocked to erect the dam.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges project will be the largest hydro-power
station in the world. There have been widespread disputes about
the project, which will be discussed in the movie, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The film is expected to be shot by the Hubei Film Studio and
will be used to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China next year.

ANKARA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items

Yeni Yuzyil (New Century)
</P>
<P>
-- The Council of Europe (CE) parliamentary assembly Thursday
adopted a report on the alleged "forced migration" of the Kurds
living in southeastern Turkey after some modifications in
Ankara's favor.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly said that the CE, which is based in
Strasbourg, France, has no right to discuss a report on Turkey's
domestic issues.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom)
</P>
<P>
-- The World Bank decided Thursday to grant Turkey a loan of
570 million U.S. dollars to help the country develop its
communications and educational projects.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Cases Decrease in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The HIV infection in Uganda has
dropped from 13 to 9.5 percent between 1994 and 1997 as a result
of increased HIV/AIDS awareness.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued here Thursday on a live satellite talk on
AIDS and behavioral change, attributed the drop to Uganda's
efforts to sensitize the general public on the dangers of
the epidemic and the proper protection.
</P>
<P>
It said polygamy especially in developing countries is
held mainly responsible for the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The talk, teleconferenced live from Washington by a panel of
three specialists on AIDS policy in the United States, was aimed
at sensitizing people on how to adopt safer sex practices as a
preventive measure to AIDS infection.
</P>
<P>
The report reiterated that abstinence, sticking to one partner
and use of the condom remain the best method in checking AIDS
prevalence.
</P>
<P>
The experts advocated for women's economic empowerment to
enable them to negotiate for safer sex with their male
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the high HIV/AIDS rate in Africa is a
result of poverty and mass migration due to armed conflicts on
the continent.
</P>
<P>
Out of 31 million people worldwide who are infected with HIV
and AIDS, 70 percent are in sub-Sahara Africa. In Uganda, 10
percent of its 20-million population are HIV positive and some
500,000 people have died of AIDS since the first case was
reported in 1982.

<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- German players are now thinking of
their next match against runners-up Mexico of Group E and predict
the match a tough one.
</P>
<P>
After finishing the winners of Group F, German captain Jurgen
Klinsmann said:"It makes no difference whether we play against
Holland or Mexico in the last 16. From now on every team has an
equal chance to win. Personally, I wouldn't have minded playing
against the Dutch because we've always beaten them."
</P>
<P>
Forward Oliver Bierhoff said:"We played a lot of high balls, but
it didn't work for us in the first half. Iran gained confidence and
had some dangerous scoring opportunities."
</P>
<P>
"Our team is playing better and better. We've shown that we're
unified and play well together," said Bierhoff, "We are pleased that
we won't play against Holland. The Mexicans are supposed to be a
good team, but we must be able to beat any team if we want to be
world champions."
</P>
<P>
German goal-keeper Andreas Kopke, who let in two goals in the
match against Yugoslavia, said:"We've accomplished our goal of not
playing against Holland. No team is easy to play against at this
point in the competition. We have a difficult game coming up
against Mexico."
</P>
<P>
Lothar Matthaus, who made World Cup history by playing his 23rd
game in the World Cup finals, said:"We are glad we're not playing
against Holland. We wanted to avoid them at all cost. We have to
watch out for Mexico, but I think we can beat them."

<P>
PARIS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- At least 30 people have been arrested
late on Thursday when drunken English fans clashed with French police
in Lens and Lille.
</P>
<P>
Police said 15 English fans were detained in Lens after a group of
about 100 drunken and chanting fans threw beer cans and glasses at
riot police outside several bars.
</P>
<P>
In Lille, northern France's biggest railway junction, police were
facing the similiar situation when they had to arrest similiar number
of fans, most of them English, after a bar owner harassed by them
called the police.
</P>
<P>
Lille local authorities have asked the bars to close for 24 hours
from 9 o'clock in the morning on Friday to prevent the fans to obtain
alcohol in the day when England meet Colombia in their last group
game.
</P>
<P>
Lille also slammed a ban on the sale of takeaway alcohol, a measure
against a possible stock-up by the fans.
</P>
<P>
Alcohol is not allowed to be consumed in the open while all bars,
restaurants and shops will refuse to sell to the supporter.

<HEADLINE> UNFPA Finances Uganda's Population Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kampala, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Population
Fund (UNFPA) has donated two million U.S. Dollars to Uganda to
facilitate advocacy programs in its population policy.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to target health, population and gender
issues, all contributing to the country's population policy,
Director of Uganda's Population Secretariat, Jotham Musinguzi,
was quoted by Friday's New Vision newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Advocacy is a major sub-program to build alliances between
all the components which support population activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Director of the UNFPA's technical and political department,
Mohamed Nizamuddin, commended Uganda on its progress in
implementing population and development initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The amount of money is small but it shows Uganda's commitment
to its population policy, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official said that the money will help the Ugandan
government to coordinate other activities in agriculture, economy
and politics because population is not only about family planning
but it is a broader issue which needs support at different
levels.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- United Technologies (UT), a
U.S. manufacturing giant, is intensifying its commitment in China
by setting up its 24th joint venture, this time with Shanghai
Electric Machinery Company (SEMC).
</P>
<P>
UT has its automobile subsidiary, UT Automotive Inc. (UTA),
holding 50 percent of the equity share in the Shanghai Ri Yong-UTA
Gate Electric Co. Ltd. with an initial investment 8.5 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture, which was established Thursday, is expected
to become a market leader in the production of automotive cooling
fan modules in China with state-of-the-art motor and air-flow
technology from UTA's Gate subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
"The coupling of SEMC's manufacturing capability and market
share in China with UTA's advanced technology and reputation will
make this joint venture a market leader in the Chinese market, as
well as other areas of Asia," said Alan Winslow, president of
UTA's Asia-Pacific Operations.
</P>
<P>
Ma Baofa, general manager of the new company, said the
cooperation should help enhance the competitive edge of SEMC's old
brand "Shunda" in both domestic and overseas markets and lift its
export share in sales by 20 percent in five years.
</P>
<P>
The former Shanghai Ri Yong Electric Machinery Works is a
state-owned automotive cooling fan supplier under SEMC with 70
percent of domestic market share. It is also an exclusive supplier
of cooling fan modules and harnesses for Shanghai Volkswagen,
Audi, Citroen and Shanghai GM.
</P>
<P>
UT Automotive is a 3-billion-U.S.-dollar, supplier of
electrical, electronic and interior trim systems and components
for car and light truck manufacturers. It has set up other joint
ventures -- two in Hubei Province and one in Tianjin -- totaling
an investment of more than 40 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Its parent company is a multinational with products ranging from
aerospace, air-conditioning equipment and electric elevators to
automotive parts and components, among others.

<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) this morning heard reports
on two proposed laws and a report on the final accounts of the
1997 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
At the ongoing third session of the NPC Standing Committee,
Wang Weicheng, chairman of the NPC Law Committee, delivered
reports on the revision of two draft laws on doctors and the
exclusive economic zones and continental shelves.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the current session should pass the revised
versions of the two draft laws which include the opinions of
members of the NPC Standing Committee and of the localities as
well as concerned departments and experts.
</P>
<P>
Guo Zhenqian, vice-chairman of the NPC Financial and Economic
Committee, delivered a report on the final accounts of the 1997
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the state revenue increased rapidly in 1997, with
control gained over total expenditures and expenditure patterns.
</P>
<P>
Guo said that the revenue out of the state financial budget was
mainly used to increase the grain risk fund, to invest in central
and western regions of the country, and to reduce the financial
deficit.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the current session of the NPC Standing
Committee should pass the final account of the 1997 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the first five months this year, the
implementation of the financial budget was not good, the result of
sluggish economic growth, poor operation of state-owned
enterprises and problems in tax collections.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of the year, he said, more efforts will be
made to strengthen revenue adjustment and control, increase
investment in economic and social development programs, and
strengthen tax collection.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Bankers' Strike Called off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A proposed Kenyan bankers' strike
set for Friday has been called off and more than 12,000 bank
workers quited their union in a row over slowdown action to back
their claim for tax-free loans.
</P>
<P>
The walk-out leaves just 3,000 bank workers still in the giant
Kenya Union of Commercial Food and Allied Workers (KUCFAW) which
represents more than 50 member organizations countrywide, local
press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The quited, represented by the All Banks Shopstewards
Committee, have accused the union of colluding with the
government to undermine their claim.
</P>
<P>
"We have today severed links with our trade union after they
deserted us in our proposal to go on strike," said Jacob Opiyo,
chairman of the shopstewards committee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the bankers have resolved to put the planned strike
"temporarily on hold", waiting further discussions among
representatives from the banking industry.
</P>
<P>
However, the bankers from all the 53 banks in the east African
country will fight until the tax on their low-interest loans is
removed, he vowed.
</P>
<P>
"We will never compromise on this offensive and punitive tax
and shall stop at nothing until the government scraps taxes on
our low-interest staff loans," he said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed free benefit tax sparked off a strike in February
among employees of the banks, forcing the government to
temporarily withdraw it.
</P>
<P>
Opiyo said if the tax proposals were implemented, members of
the bank will lose all the properties they had secured using the
loans because they can no longer service it.

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Investment in Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will
increase its investments in agriculture by a big margin this year,
the People's Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper did not give an exact investment figure.
</P>
<P>
The increased investment will be used to build water
conservation, agricultural, forestry and poverty-elimination
projects, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country plans to increase its input in
agriculture from other channels for building irrigation
facilities, harnessing rivers and speeding up farmland capital
construction.
</P>
<P>
China is a traditional agricultural state. Though its annual
grain output has risen to 500 billion kilograms, agriculture still
remains a weak link in the country, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
The country suffers from a loss of farmland to other uses, low
yields and a lack of irrigation systems. All these elements curb
the growth of agriculture and the national economy as a whole, the
paper said.

<HEADLINE> Banks to Increase Support for Small, Medium-sized Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC)
will adopt a series of policy measures to support the healthy
development of small and medium-sized enterprises, according to
Shang Fulin, vice-governor of the PBOC.
</P>
<P>
Shang said that the PBOC will issue a circular on financial
support to national economic development, which lists small and
medium-sized enterprises as well as township enterprises as the
key sectors to receive aid.
</P>
<P>
In the circular, the PBOC urges the Minsheng Bank of China,
city commercial banks and credit cooperatives to play a leading
role in supporting the small and medium-sized enterprises and
township enterprises. State-owned commercial banks, other
commercial banks and non-bank institutions should also actively
provide credit services for them in accordance with related
regulations, according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
The central bank demanded that loans should be extended to
small and medium-sized enterprises which have selling products,
make good profits, develop and use new technologies.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC urged all commercial banks to utilize various
financial tools with flexibility to provide settlement,
remittance, transfer of accounts, financial management and other
services for enterprises, and improve the financial service system
for small and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC also is seeking solutions for small and medium-sized
enterprises' difficulties in using mortgage and guarantee loans,
Shang said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by state-owned commercial banks show that
at the end of March the outstanding amount of loans from
state-owned commercial banks to small and medium-sized enterprises
was 1.7 trillion yuan, about 38 percent of the total outstanding
amount of loans of state-owned commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has ratified the establishment of 79 city
commercial banks, and 73 others are being studied and should be
ratified soon. The Minsheng Bank, which mainly serves small and
medium-sized enterprises, started operations in 1996 and has so
far set up five branches and 14 sub-branches.
</P>
<P>
According to related statistics, more than 99 percent of
China's businesses are small and medium-sized enterprises which
contribute 60 percent of the country's total industrial output
value, 40 percent of its tax revenues and 75 percent of its total
work force.
</P>
<P>
During the last 20 years, the growth of small and medium-sized
enterprises have quadrupled that of large enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Guilin Mayor Foresees Stronger Economic, Trade Links with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Mayor of south China's Guilin city
Cai Yonglun said here today the people of the well-known tourist
attraction are expecting the visit by United States President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Cai told Xinhua that his city has a longstanding history of
economic and trade relations with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
President Clinton arrived in Xi'an in northwest China's Shaanxi
province at the first leg of a nine-day state visit to China on
Thursday evening. He will proceed to visit Beijing, Shanghai,
Guilin and Hong Kong. Xi'an, Beijing, Guilin are among the six
most popular tourist destinations in China.
</P>
<P>
Guilin, long renowned for its elegant rolling limestone hills
mirrored by limpid waters, has drawn 23 US-funded enterprises to
settle there.
</P>
<P>
Pepsi, the first U.S. firm to invest in the picturistic city in
1990, has built a 5-million-US-dollar production base in Guilin
to serve south China markets. In 1997, the Guilin Pepsi company
registered a 67 percent increase in sales revenue over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Trade and economic relations between Guilin and the U.S. has
entered a new phase of growth since the forging of diplomatic ties
between China and the U.S. in 1979, he said, and total U.S.
investment in the city has reached 52 million US dollars at
present.
</P>
<P>
The largest Sino-US joint venture in the city is a pneumatic
tools factory with a total investment of 10 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Guilin has tourist industry as its main industry. Meanwhile, it
conducts trade with more than 50 countries and regions around the
world, and the U.S. is its second largest trade partner.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, two-way trade volume between the city and the U.S.
side reached approximately 27 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The city, with more than 35 percent of its land covered by
forests or woods, has increasingly been improving investment
environment by local efforts to strengthen its air, rail, road and
waterway transport and telecommunications links with the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
Cai said that Guilin, which has established sisterly ties with
the city of Orlando of the State of Florida, U.S., welcomes more
American investment.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Youths Urged to Join Drug Elimination Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Minister of Home Affairs
Colonel Tin Hlaing Friday called on youths in the country to join
up in the battle against narcotic drugs and to totally eliminate
them in accordance with the theme -- Youths Uniting to Prevent
Drug Abuse -- adopted by the United Nations this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a prize presentation ceremony of stories, poems,
articles, cartoons and songs contests honoring the International
Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, Tin Hlaing, who
is also chairman of the Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control,
said the proliferation of the narcotic habit among youths spell a
disaster to all countries including Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
In the demand eradication aspect, he said, preventive education
and information are continuously disseminated to the students and
youths and the public in addition to treatment and rehabilitation
to drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
In the law enforcement aspect, he noted, not only narcotics
like opium, heroin, marijuana and stimulants are being seized in
the country but also clandestine laboratories producing them are
being increasingly ferreted out and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the emergence of the Mongla opium-free zone in
the country's eastern Shan state last year to the cooperative
efforts of the local ethnic minorities, adding that plans are
underway to bring about more similar zones.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has laid down a two-point national strategy for
narcotic drug control -- to designate narcotic drug eradication
and prevention as a national duty and to gradually eliminate poppy
cultivation by raising the standard of living of the national
races in the border areas.
</P>
<P>
Three tactics of supply elimination, demand elimination and law
enforcement are employed to implement the strategies.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Foreign Investment Dominates Oil, Gas Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been undertaking joint
exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas with a
number of foreign companies in its effort to increase the sector's
output to meet the domestic demand as well as to boost the export.
</P>
<P>
Up to the end of February this year, investments in the sector
from companies of Australia, Britain, France, Indonesia, Japan,
Malaysia, Thailand and the United States amounted to nearly 2.3
billion U.S. dollars in 45 related projects, forming the largest
chunk of the country's 7 billion dollar total foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Of the country's seven onshore and five offshore areas, the
Yadana gas field, made up of three blocks in the Gulf of Mottama,
has been explored and developed on a profit-sharing basis by a
foreign oil group comprising France's TOTAL, the United States'
UNOCAL, Thailand's PTTEP and the state-run Myanmar Oil and Gas
Enterprise (MOGE).
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the 674-kilometer pipeline (Myanmar
section for 414 km) running from the Yadana field to Thailand's
Ratchaburi, natural gas produced from the field is due to be
exported to Thailand beginning later this year at a rate of 522
million cubic feet (14.78 million cubic-meters) per day under a
30-year contract initiated between the Petroleum Authority of
Thailand and the developers in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
Another Myanmar's offshore natural gas field, the Yedagun off
the Tanintharyi coast constituted with another four blocks, has
also been explored and being developed by another foreign oil
group made up of the U.S. Texaco, Britain's Premier, Japan's
Nippon, Thailand's PTTEP and Myanmar's MOGE since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Yedagun gas is also set to be sold to Thailand beginning
1999 according to another 30-year contract reached between the
Petroleum Authority of Thailand and the developers in March last
year.
</P>
<P>
The export target of the Yedagun gas, which was originally set
at 200 million cubic feet (5.6 million cubic meters) per day, is
to be increased to 400 million cubic feet (11.3 million cubic
meters) per day by the year 2000 by drilling some more test
wells, according to a recent official report.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the two oil groups, the Atlantic Richfield
company (ARCO) of the U.S. has also been drilling for oil and gas
at two test wells, the Shwepyihtay and the Shwepyiaye, off the
Mottama coast. Of these, the Shwepyihtay well has been yielding
gas on a commercial scale since March last year.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's Genting Sanyen and Dataran Isibumi are also
conducting activities in other six offshore blocks.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies engaged in the extraction of oil and gas at
onshore areas in central Myanmar include Indonesia's APN and PT
Exspan Sumatra in Chauk, Yenangyaung, Ohndwe, Kyaukkyi-Mindon and
Padaukpin-Moenatgon areas.
</P>
<P>
Other foreign companies took up oil fields of Mann, Mindegyi
Chaungtha, Htaukshabin, Indaw and Myanaung.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the foreign investment in the crude oil and natural
gas, the sector's output grew by 37.7 percent in the 1997-98
fiscal year ending March with the crude oil production increasing
to 6.1 million barrels from 3.8 million barrels in the 1996-97 and
the natural gas output rising to 68,540 million cubic feet (1,940
million cubic meters) from 58,579 million cubic feet (1,658
million cubic meters) in the previous year, according to the
latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that the country's economy achieved a
growth rate of 4.6 percent in the 1997-98 fiscal year.

<P>
KIEV, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's Vice Foreign Minister
Vladimir Handogy said Thursday that the first round of
negotiations on measures of building military trust in the Black
Sea region was "unprecedented".
</P>
<P>
A communique following the talks on Tuesday and Wednesday said
that the adoption and implementation of these measures would
support economic cooperations between the littoral countries of
the Black Sea and strengthen security, peace and stability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The measures will not be directed against any third country, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Handogy told reporters that until today there was no such
international document which served as a guideline for military
activities on the sea.
</P>
<P>
Though no final document was reached in the negotiations, the
countries agreed the document, if approved, will have politically
compulsory force, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the parties concerned have agreed on the agenda
of the second round negotiations scheduled for October 6 in
Vienna, where they will decide on the scope of military trust
measures and the forms of military activities on the Black Sea.

</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of villagers and school children in the

elect its leaders as the villages in other parts of China do, and
he added this will bring an even brighter future for the villagers.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the villagers now have TV and telephone sets apart
from their own school, Clinton said that life of the villagers has
improved remarkably in this village as in other rural areas in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of advanced farming technology has enabled the
villagers to pursue other trades such as tourism and manufacturing
such as 12 village businesses, he added.
</P>
<P>
The visiting US president and his wife Hillary and delegation
were accorded a warm welcome from the village head Yang
Yunlong and his fellow villagers and school children.

COLOMBO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has become a major
international transit point in the drug trade, according to police
sources here Friday.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 130 million U.S. dollars worth of
narcotics are illicitly smuggled using the country annually.
</P>
<P>
A ship with seven tons of cannabis from Cambodia to Sri Lanka
has been found by Cambodian authority recently, according to local
newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
Drug problem has been growing serious in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Over 23,000 drug smugglers were convicted in Sri Lanka last
year while police arrested about 20,000 people for drug offenses
and seized a lot of heroin.
</P>
<P>
There are at least 100,000 drug addicts in the country and the
number keeps on increasing, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government spends over 46 million U.S. dollars
every year to upkeep 10,000 of these addicts. Drug addicted
prisoners help the scourge to spread.
</P>

However, the sources added steps have been taken to set up
separate prisons for drug addicts and for more rehabilitation

TIRANA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Aleksander Avdeen said Wednesday that negotiations based on the
respect of Yugoslavia's sovereign integrity and the Yugoslav
Constitution are the only solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Avdeen made the remark in Shkup, the capital city of Macedonia,
after meeting Macedonian leaders, the Macedonian Press reported.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped ethnic Albanians in Kosovo could control their
sentiments and come to the negotiating table. There is no other
way out. The use of force cannot solve the Kosovo crisis, the
official stressed.
</P>
<P>
The key to the settlement of the issue is to grant autonomy to
Kosovo in line with international standards, Avdeen said. However,
the autonomy must be implemented within the Serbian Republic, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Avdeen criticized NATO threats to send forces to the border
area between Macedonia, Albania and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He opposed the threat of force, which is the basic principle of
the Yeltsin-Milosevic statement made public in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Avdeen, initiating a new round of diplomatic activities on
Kosovo, arrived in Shkup on Tuesday on a two-day visit following
his Albania tour.
</P>

More than 300 people have been killed since the outbreak of
armed conflict between ethnic Albanians and Serb police in
Kosovo. The troubled province is now under the threat of escalated

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Vows to Totally Eliminate Drugs in 15 years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will totally eliminate
poppy cultivation in 15 years, said Myanmar Minister of Home
Affairs Colonel Tin Hlaing Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony marking the International Day Against
Illicit Trafficking, Tin Hlaing, who is also chairman of the
Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control, said the period can be
shortened with assistance from external sources.
</P>
<P>
A baseline data collection project on poppy cultivation and
drug addicts is being implemented in the whole country starting
January this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has been doing its best to eradicate narcotic drugs
with some achievements in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of this year, the Myanmar authorities
destroyed a dozen heroin refineries in Shan state in the northern
part of the country, following the destruction of 33 refineries in
the state in 1997, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Over 2,600 kilograms of narcotic drugs including more than 170
kg of heroin were also seized in the country by the enforcement
agencies with over 8,000 hectares of poppy plantations destroyed
in the same period.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the authorities confiscated a total of 15,146 kg of
narcotics including 1,401 kg of heroin and 7,883 kg of opium as
well as more than 5 million tablets of amphetamine stimulant, and
took action against 5,361 people involved in 3,864 drug-related
cases.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, Myanmar was able to turn the Mongla region in
eastern Shan state into an opium-free zone and efforts are being
made to bring about more similar zones.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has laid down a two-point national strategy for
narcotic drug control -- to designate narcotic drug eradication
and prevention as a national duty and to gradually eliminate poppy
cultivation by raising the standard of living of the ethnic groups
in the border areas.

<HEADLINE> China's Muslims Gather on Day of Jumah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- At 1:30 in the afternoon, more
than 300 Muslims of China's Hui nationality who were dressed in
white hats gathered in the 7-meter-high Tongxin Mosque, knelt on
the carpet in rows and piously prayed toward the west.
</P>
<P>
Today, on the day of Jumah, Zhou Xuehai, a 57-year-old Hui
farmer in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, as
usual, came to the Tongxin Mosque half an hour in advance from his
home five kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
He first went to the bathroom next to the main hall and took a
shower. Then he put on his white hat and entered the hall to pray.
</P>
<P>
"As I am a Muslim, attending the gathering on the day of Jumah
is compulsory," he said.
</P>
<P>
Like the 1 billion Muslims worldwide, about 20 million Muslims
in China also are holding gatherings in the country's 36,000
mosques.
</P>
<P>
Since China started its reform and opening-up, the policy on
freedom of religious belief has been revived and all religious
sites reopened. The country has also built new mosques.
</P>
<P>
The Tongxin Mosque, dating back more than 600 years, has been
put under the special protection of the autonomous region. There
is one mosque for each 500 Muslims in Tongxin County.
</P>
<P>
"I have attended the gathering on the day of Jumah for more
than 10 years," said Zhou, who is now running a cashmere business
in addition to farming. With an increase in the living standard,
he now goes to the mosque by motorcycle, instead of on foot.
</P>
<P>
At the same time people are gathering at the Tongxin Mosque,
prayers can be heard from the nearby Beida Mosque, only three
kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
"Each Muslim enjoys the freedom of religious belief in China,"
said Ma Xuefu, director in charge of the Beida Mosque.
</P>
<P>
In Ningxia, China's largest residence for people of the Hui
nationality, 1.78 million Muslims are celebrating their day of
Jumah in more than 3,000 mosques. Tongxin, a county with the
largest population of Hui nationality in China, has 15 mosques
that belong to four different Islamic sections.
</P>
<P>
Ma Quanyou, a 52-year-old farmer of Hui nationality, said the
Muslims attending today's gathering in the Beida Mosque come from
three different religious sections.
</P>
<P>
"Each Islamic section reads the same Koran and worships the
same Allah. The only difference lies in the religious rites," he
said.
</P>
<P>
To show respect to Muslims of different Islamic sections, the
Beida Mosque has a curtain hung in the prayer hall. Muslims of
different sections can pray in their own way behind the curtain.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Signs Revised Bailout Agreement With IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
signed a revised bailout agreement with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) to arrest the country's economic crisis, according to
local press reports Friday.
</P>
<P>
The revised agreement, the fourth in nine months, was signed by
Coordinating Minister of Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar
Kartasasmita and IMF Asia-Pacific Director Hubert Neiss here
Wednesday night and was announced Thursday after a meeting between
President B.J. Habibie and Neiss.
</P>
<P>
Compared with last April's agreement, the IMF has revised
downward its macroeconomic forecasts for the country as a result
of the recent political crisis that led to the resignation of
former president Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Under the new agreement, the rupiah is expected to strengthen
to 10,000 per dollar by the end of 1998, against about 15,000
currently; inflation is projected to top 80 percent; the country's
economy is projected to contract by more than 10 percent and the
budget deficit is to be 8.5 percent of gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
A report quoted analysts as saying that the new forecasts are
too rosy. They believed that the inflation rate might even reach
three digits if the situation did not improve, and the rupiah
target of 10,000 is optimistic.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement also allows the Indonesian government to
maintain subsidies on food, fuel, electricity and other spending
to help the poor cope with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the IMF insisted these subsidies be phased out
within the year.
</P>
<P>
The revised agreement calls for further support of the
international community to ensure the success of the IMF's
economic program.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank announced in Manila Thursday that it
would extend 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in new loans to Indonesia.
The World Bank has already pledged 1 billion dollars and Japan is
also expected to come up with more aid next month.
</P>
<P>
"Rebuilding the economy is for the Indonesian people alone to
do. But this endeavor is difficult without the help from the
international community, given the extent of the problem,"
Ginandjar said.
</P>
<P>
The revised agreement paves the way for the resumption of the
43-billion-dollar IMF-led rescue package. It was reported that the
IMF Executive Board will decide on the disbursement of the second
tranche of 3 billion U.S. dollars in loan in the middle of next
month.
</P>
<P>
The disbursement of the second tranche, supposed to be
channeled in stages in May, June and July, was delayed due to
riots in Jakarta in May and the political crisis in the country.

<HEADLINE> Violence Against Women Increases in Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Violence against women in Ecuador
has increased 166.6 percent in the last four years, according to
the Center for Studies and Research on Woman in Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
The situation has become a social and economic problem for the
country, a local press report said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, there were 27,000 reported cases of abuse and
maltreatment to women, while 14,000 cases were documented in the
first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-seven percent of the women experienced physical and
psychological maltreatment, while 13 percent, most of them minors,
go to police precincts to report sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
The women's center attributes the increase of reports to the
fact that more victims report their cases now, where they once
preferred to remain silent.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the country's Human Rights
Ecumenical Commission, most of the women abused or offended come
from low income families or situations.

<HEADLINE> China to Step Up National Drug Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China will increase its efforts on
drug control and strengthen cooperation with international
organizations and other countries to combat cross-border drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted an official with the Ministry of
Public Security as saying that a defense force composed of
police, militaries, Customs officers, militiamen and border
residents will be set up in the southwest border area, which is
adjacent to the "Golden Triangle" drug source.
</P>
<P>
This is among a series of steps to block the channels for drug
trafficking through China. The patrol are also meant to keep drugs
out of the country, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Drug growing, processing and trafficking outside China's
southwest border has become increasingly serious.
</P>
<P>
According to James Sasser, US Ambassador to China, the United
States and China are to open drug enforcement offices in each
other's capitals to transmit information and co-ordinate
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics given by the Narcotics Control Office
indicate that between 1991 and 1997, 413,423 drug-related criminal
cases were solved and 309,116 people involved were arrested across
the country.
</P>
<P>
Also during that period, 26.88 tons of heroin, 14.48 tons of
opium, 5.63 tons of amphetamine and 10.8 tons of marijuana were
confiscated, the statistics show.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, China had 540,000 registered drug addicts,
more than 80 percent of whom are younger than 35.
</P>
<P>
But even official sources acknowledge that the actual number
could be much higher.

<HEADLINE> 3 Percent GDP Growth Predicted for Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines could still achieve
a 3 percent growth in gross domestic product (GDP) this year and a
5 percent increase in 1999, the Philippine Daily Inquirer said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Cayetano Paderanga, forecaster of the Pacific
Economic Cooperation Council for the Philippines, as saying that
despite the slowdown of the economy in the first quarter, the
country's GDP could grow by 3 percent this year and probably 5
percent next year.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is "a very good chance" that the country's
average inflation rate for this year would be contained at 9
percent despite the disappointing 10.3 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
Investment growth in the country would drastically decelerate
to 2.4 percent this year from 10 percent last year because of a
tight monetary policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Taking into consideration the recent data, Paderanga said, he
has revised his export growth forecast from 9 percent this year
and 11 percent next year to 15 percent for both years.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has likewise changed his import growth
projection for this year from 7 percent to 2 percent and for next
year from 9 percent to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
As the country's GDP growth was registered at only 2.5 percent
in the first quarter, the government this week revised the growth
target for the whole year from 3-4 percent to 2.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Teen Pregnancy Rate Drops in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A report released by a
government agency Thursday says that the teen pregnancy rate is
down across the United States.
</P>
<P>
The report said that falling teen birth rates cannot be
attributed to an increase in abortions. In fact, in every state
that reports data, fewer teens are getting pregnant in the first
place, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under
the Department of Health and Human Service.
</P>
<P>
Officials cite less sex and greater use of birth control as the
major reasons. Others suggest an improved economy may be giving
teens more hope for the future and more motivation to avoid
getting pregnant.
</P>
<P>
Still, nearly one million teen-age girls become pregnant each
year, and more than 200,000 girls have abortions.
</P>
<P>
Previous reports found that teen birth rates and teen sexual
activity both dropped by 1995.
</P>
<P>
"The early 1990s were a turning point in adolescent pregnancy
trends, following the increase that occurred in the 1980s," said
Donna Shalala, secretary of the Department of Health and Human
Services.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Banks' Foreign Debts Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Due to the continued weakening of
the peso against the U.S. dollar, the foreign exchange liabilities
of the Philippine commercial banking industry increased to 532
billion pesos (13.4 billion U.S. dollars) in April, according to
the latest figures provided by the Central Bank of the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the banks' foreign debts in April were 156
billion pesos (3.7 billion dollars) higher than in the same month
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The increase in foreign debts was mainly due to the
depreciation of the country's currency against the dollar, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Since a regional financial crisis hit the country last July,
the Philippine currency has depreciated by more than 30 percent
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the central bank, in dollar terms, the
foreign debts of the country's commercial banks had actually gone
down to 13.4 billion dollars as of April from 14.2 billion dollars
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Bank sources said that the commercial banks had been reducing
their foreign debts following the drop in import requirements in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The commercial banks had also been trying to pay their maturing
foreign exchange obligations, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
But their net foreign exchange liabilities still amounted to
8.1 billion dollars, they said.

NEW YORK, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Internet-related spending of

<HEADLINE> Chicago Bulls Start to Search for Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- With the NBA draft over, the
Chicago Bulls start to search a replacement for coach Phil
Jackson, who left the sixth-time champion team Monday.
</P>
<P>
But it looks very difficult to find someone who is able to win
the hearts and trust of Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis
Rodman.
</P>
<P>
"We'll do it slowly, we'll do it surely and we'll do our
homework," Bulls general manager Jerry Krause said last night.
"We'll do what we have to do."
</P>
<P>
Krause said he and chairman Jerry Reinsdorf know what they're
looking for, and they have a solid number of people they want to
talk to about the job.
</P>
<P>
The general manager said the Bulls want to hire someone within
the next few weeks, and they prefer to hire a coach who can sign a
long-term contract.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, Pippen and Rodman will be free agents this summer, and
whether they remain in the team could depend on who will coach
them.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try and get this team back," Krause said. "We
lost a good coach, but we are interesting in bringing this team
back."

<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:

<P>

the ruling coalition, who consists of Liberal and National
parties.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Things Go Well in Hong Kong Since Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Thursday that things have gone well since the transition of Hong
Kong's sovereignty to China nearly one year ago and Hong Kong is a
"success story" in Asia's democracy.
</P>
<P>
"In general there has been a high degree of autonomy. Economic
commerce continues. The freedom of expression continues," Rubin
told a briefing at the Foreign Press Center.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the transition one year ago, many people in the West
were worried about the future of Hong Kong despite firm
commitments from the central Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also praised the assembly election which took place last
month in the region, saying "clearly the voting was a strong
endorsement of democracy."
</P>
<P>
"So in that sense this Hong Kong is a success story for the
future of democracy in Asia and the importance of Hong Kong to the
U.S.-China relationship," said Rubin.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Opposes U.N. Debate on Israel's Jerusalem Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Thursday that it would oppose a Security Council debate on
Israel's plans for Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said Bahrain, the only Arab country on the
15-member Security Council currently, had informed the council
it was preparing a draft resolution on Israel's plan to expand
Jerusalem municipal services to Jewish settlements in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain said Arab ambassadors to the United Nations wanted an
open debate on the issue, meaning that non-council members could
participate.
</P>
<P>
But State Department spokesman James Rubin said the proposed
Security Council debate on Israel's plan for Jerusalem would be
counterproductive and unhelpful to the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Security Council discussion of this issue would be unhelpful
to the peace process. Any action in the Security Council would
be counterproductive to the success of our discussions with the
Palestinians and the Israelis," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It might feel good to engate in such an exercise at the
United Nations, but it will do bad to the peace process," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also opposed to enhance the status of the Palestinian
mission to the United Nations as Arab countries proposed. He
said giving the Palestinian mission more rights would amount to
"unilateral action" by the Arabs, undermining U.S. attempts to
prevent Israel's own unilateral actions.
</P>
<P>
"We oppose enhanced status for the PLO(Palestine Liberation
Organization) in the General Assembly. The PLO is not a state
and should not enjoy rights tantamount to those of a state," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The status of the Palestinian mission is expected to come up
on July 7, when the General Assembly considers its request for
almost the same rights as a member state, a U.N. spokesman said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But Rubin said the request by the Palestinians would
"constitute exactly the kind of unilateral action that we have
asked both parties to avoid, and would therefore, undercut our
efforts to get Israel to refrain from such acts as well."

MONTPELLIER, June 25 (Xinhua) -- German striker Oliver Bierhoff
said on Thursday he was delighted with their 2-0 victory over Iran in
their group F match here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to show that we were better than the team that played
against Yugoslavia," said Bierhoff after Germany reached the last 16
in the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
"We saw in the other games that as long as it was 0-0 there was
always a danger that the Iranians might score," he addeed.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Particularly in the first half they quite often looked a
threat and so we were relieved to get the two goals. We tried to play
down the wings a lot and it worked as we saw with the first goal."
</P>
<P>
He added, "It would have been nice to score one or two goals more
but we're happy with the result."
</P>
<P>
Bierhoff scored the first goal in five minutes into the seconf
half.

<P>
The American team finished bottom of Group F after conceding

</P>

Sampson also talked about his future:"I have not spoken about
this with the president of the U.S. Soccer Federation. Obviously
it's his decision but I'm very proud of what we've accomplished
during this World Cup."
</P>
<P>
"I think U.S. soccer has a great future ahead of it." Sampson

best against one of the best teams in the world," said Talebi, whose
team lost Germany 2-0 in their last group F game here.

<P>
He said, "We came to do our best, it's never easy to play against a
(former) world champion. We'll gain a lot of experience from this."

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from a stand
collapse Thursday at a sports complex in southern Russia has risen
to 22, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred in Nalchik, capital city of the
Kabardino-Balkaria republic, as an opening ceremony for the
national freestyle wrestling championship was underway, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three people were injured in the accident, three of them
in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, flags will fly at half mast in the republic to mourn
the victims, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent a cable, conveying his
condolences to Valery Kokov, the leader of the Kabardino-Balkaria
republic.
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked by the news about the tragedy in the capital of
your republic," Yeltsin said. "It was particularly hard that the
tragedy occurred during a festival -- the freestyle championship
among juniors."
</P>
<P>
The local government has set up a commission to investigate the
accident and promised financial compensation to the victims'
families and the injured.

KAMPALA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Vice Chairman of the
COMESA Council of Ministers Brig. Moses Ali Thursday urged all
members to meet their payment obligations to the organization in
time to avoid sanctions and keep the spirit of cooperation in the
bloc.
</P>
<P>
The vice chairman, who is also the Second Deputy Prime
Minister of Uganga, made the call when addressing the Council of
Ministers meeting of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
He regretted the late payment of contributions which affects the
programs and activities of the COMESA Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Although they have not achieved much yet, they have been able to
realize modest success and most importantly they have managed to
keep together as an organization, Ali said.
</P>
<P>
He told the meeting that the building to house the COMESA
headquarters in Kampala has been secured with the restructuring and
reorganization of the secretariat nearly completed.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA court has also been established and trade between
member states of the organization has been increased, he added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier's Body Back Home From Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The remains of Israeli soldier
Itamar Ilya, killed last September in a botched commando raid in
south Lebanon, was brought back to Israel via a French airplane on
Thursday, Israel radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The return of Ilya is part of a deal worked out between
Israel, Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and the Lebanese
government after months of tough negotiations mediated by both the
French government and the International Committee of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
Ilya's body was transported to Lod military airport in central
Israel. Once the body has been positively identified, the French
plane will fly back to Beirut with the remains of 40 Hezbollah
fighters killed in clashes in south Lebanon with Israeli troops
and its allied South Lebanon Army militia.
</P>
<P>
Among the bodies will be that of Hadi Nasrallah, son of
Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 60 Hezbollah activists being held in Israeli
prison, will be released Friday as the last stage of the deal.
</P>
<P>
Ilya was killed in last September, when his commando squad was
ambushed by Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon. Israeli
helicopters failed to bring back his remains from the field.
</P>
<P>
The swap was the first exchange of its kind since July 1996,
when Hezbollah returned the remains of two Israeli soldiers held
since 1986 in exchange for 126 guerrillas under a German-brokered
deal.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-styled "security zone" in south
Lebanon in 1985 after two invasions, with the claimed aim to
protect its northern border from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim militant Hezbollah is the most
active guerrilla group fighting to oust Israeli troops and its
allied Lebanese militiamen from the area.
</P>
<P>
Despite the swap deal, confrontation between Israel and
Hezbollah continued. In the latest incident Thursday morning, two
Israeli soldiers were killed by road-side bombs in south
Lebanon. Hezbollah has claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Israel is locked up in a war of attrition in south Lebanon,
from where it now wants to pull its troops out, but with
preconditions. The United Nations Security Council resolution 425,
adopted two decades ago, calls for "immediate and unconditional"
Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.

</P>
<P>
She said this here Thursday when attending celebrations

She pledged her support to FIDA in its mission to disseminate
information and assist women, those in rural areas in particular
and appealed to the general public to contribute as much as
possible.

Ugandans should use the 10 years of FIDA existence and 50
years of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to rekindle
their cause to continue the struggle for justice in society, she
added.

<HEADLINE> Germany Says "No" to Kosovo Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- German leaders Thursday made it clear
to visiting Kosovo-Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova that Bonn will
only support autonomy for the Serbian province of Kosovo, not an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Rugova in Bonn Thursday afternoon, Kohl
expressed deep worry about escalation of violence in Kosovo as
well as sufferings of civilians, German government spokesman Otto
Hauser said.
</P>
<P>
While noting that Belgrade should take the main responsibility
for the worsening situation, Kohl made an urgent call on
Kosovo-Albanians to make their own contributions to ending
bloodshed and refugee outflows.
</P>
<P>
"What is necessary is a clear commitment to non-violence, to a
peace dialogue with Belgrade with international participation and
to a negotiated solution for Kosovo on the basis of a broad
autonomy within the territories of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia," the spokesman quoted Kohl as saying.
</P>
<P>
Similar view was also voiced by German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel earlier Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot support anything but autonomy for Kosovo.... The
ethnic Albanians should not cherish any illusion about an
independent state," Kinkel said after his talks with Rugova
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been running high in Kosovo since February, when
Serbian police clashed with ethnic Albanians seeking independence
from Belgrade and integration into neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, Yugoslavia has stripped autonomy of the
ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the province's
population.
</P>
<P>
As he did Wednesday in Brussels, Rugova Thursday again pleaded
in Bonn for "an independent and neutral Kosovo" as well as "an
international protectorate" status for the region in what he
described as a transitional step to full independence.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the world community to intervene in order to
halt Serbian attacks in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The political dialogue with Belgrade could only be resumed
after such attacks had been stopped, Rugova said.
</P>
<P>
While not ruling out a possible outside military intervention,
Kohl stressed that international pressure on Belgrade was only
plausible if the whole Kosovo-Albanian leadership made
unconditional commitment to the non-violence approach and pledged
to stop the violent activities by armed ethnic Albanian rebels.
</P>
<P>
According to Western press reports, Rugova, who backs
negotiation for independence, is rapidly losing popular support to
Kosovo rebels who are fighting for independence but whose
leadership and structure are little known.
</P>
<P>
Rugova, however, pledged in Bonn that he would make efforts to
contact the rebel groups.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court: Attorney-Client Privilege Protects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A Supreme Court ruling Thursday
blocked Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr's attempt to get the
notes taken by White House aide Vincent Foster's lawyer during a
meeting shortly before Foster's 1993 suicide.
</P>
<P>
The court, by a 6-3 vote, ruled that the attorney-client
privilege of confidentiality protects against disclosure of the
notes even after Foster's death.
</P>
<P>
The decision is expected to have a lasting impact on the legal
profession and all Americans who at some time seek a lawyer's
help.
</P>
<P>
The justices overturned a federal appeals court ruling that
Washington lawyer James Hamilton's three pages of notes might have
to be surrendered to a Whitewater grand jury that issued a
subpoena for the notes in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"It has been generally, if not universally, accepted for well
over a century that the attorney-client privilege survives the
death of the client in a case such as this," Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist wrote for the court. "While the arguments against the
survival of the privilege are by no means frivolous, they are
based in large part on speculation."
</P>
<P>
Starr is trying to determine whether presidential aides lied
about whether Hillary Rodham Clinton had a role in a White House
purge of its travel office staff. She has said she had no role,
</P>
<P>
Foster's 1993 conversation with Hamilton reportedly focused on
those firings, but Hamilton claimed an attorney-client privilege
and sought to keep his notes away from Whitewater investigators.
</P>
<P>
Never before had the Supreme Court ruled on whether the
time-honored privilege extends beyond the grave.
</P>
<P>
Hamilton took his notes during a July 11, 1993, meeting with
Foster. Nine days later, Foster was found dead in a park outside
Washington. Authorities said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot
wound.
</P>
<P>
Starr had conceded that Hamilton's notes would be protected if
Foster were still alive, but he argued that Foster's death ended
the legal privilege.
</P>
<P>
That argument was vehemently opposed by the American Bar
Association, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers,
the American Corporate Counsel Association and the National
Hospice Organization.
</P>
<P>
Courts long have recognized other privileges of confidentiality
as well -- between spouses, priest and penitent, doctor and
patient. But the attorney-client privilege is by far the oldest.

<HEADLINE> Belgium for Lifting Sanctions Against Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Belgium favors lifting the
sanctions imposed on Burundi by regional states after the July
1996 coup that brought Pierre Buyoya to power, the U.N.
Humanitarian Information Unit IRIN said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian Foreign Minister told Belgian radio that it was
time "to pay a little attention to the fate of the (Burundi)
population, which is currently dramatic," an IRIN press release
said.
</P>
<P>
A senior Belgian diplomat told IRIN Thursday that Belgium
believed Buyoya's government deserved some recognition for taking
"important steps" and demonstrating "seriousness" in both the
internal and Arusha peace processes.
</P>
<P>
Before the peace talks by Burundi's 17 parties held in Arusha,
Tanzania earlier this month, Buyoya named an official of one of
the Hutu factions as vice president of the country and agreed to
attend the talks which resulted in agreeing, last Sunday, to a
truce as from July 20 in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The issue of sanctions and a possible summit of regional heads
of state to review them was not officially mentioned in Sunday's
declaration of the 17-party talks, and seems unlikely before the
next round of talks set for July 20, analysts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Besides, European Commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro also said
Tuesday that the EU was intending to gradually resume its
cooperation with Burundi, according to an EU press release quoted
by the IRIN report.
</P>
<P>
Pinheiro, the commissioner responsible for development,
cooperation and external relations with the ACP countries, met
Tuesday with Speaker of the Burundi parliament Leonce
Ngendakumana, who briefed him on recent political progress in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Pinheiro declared that the EU would start by relaunching
rehabilitation as well as returnee and displaced peoples'
resettlement activities. New resources could be made available as
progress is made in the peace process, Pinheiro was quoted as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Nile Islands to Become Natural Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The dozens of Egyptian islands lying
on the river Nile will be preserved as natural reserves, according
to a decision made by Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri said in press statements that the governorates in
which these islands are situated should treat them in accordance
with the Environment Law.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Cabinet and Follow-up Affairs Talaat Ahmed Hammad
said there are about 144 permanent islands in the course of the
Nile in addition to about 216 seasonal islands, which appear and
disappear depending on the level of Nile water. Total area of the
permanent islands is 36,861 feddans (15,481.62 hectares).
</P>
<P>
The decision to preserve these islands as natural reserves was
issued in compliance with the law for the protection of the Nile
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
The 6,700-kilometer-long Nile, the world's second longest river
and Africa's longest, runs 1,530 kilometers across Egypt
south-north before pouring into the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
With a deficient rainfall over the entire country, human
existence in Egypt depends closely on irrigation from the Nile,
resulting in the acute concentration of nearly 98 percent of all
Egyptians in the Nile Valley (only 4 percent of Egypt's area).

SANAA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Five people were killed and 12
others wounded in riots in Sanaa and other cities in the past few
days, Yemeni Interior Minister Hussein Moh'd Arab told a weekly
published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the "September 26th" weekly, the minister
said that two civilians were killed and six others, including four
policemen, were injured in Maareb, some 170 kilometers east of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
In the capital, three policemen and three civilians were
injured while two civilians were killed in Khamr, Sanaa Province
in a tribal dispute that coincided with the riots, he added
</P>
<P>
The riots in Sanaa damaged seven private cars and four police
vehicles and destroyed a number of placards in the streets, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Investigations into the riots have showed that some political
parties were involved by inciting to destabilize the country and
hinder its development process and economic construction, he added.
</P>
<P>
A number of Yemeni cities have witnessed riots and
demonstrations since Thursday last week when the government
announced to raise prices of fuel and food by 20 and 40 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The price rise is part of Yemen's economic, financial and
administrative reform program that went into effect in 1995.

<HEADLINE> AL Urges EU to Intervene in Israel's Jerusalem Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid Thursday urged European Union's
(EU) Middle East envoy Miguel Moratinos to intervene in an Israeli
plan to expand Jerusalem, the Middle News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"I asked Moratinos to intervene to put an end to the Israeli
anti-peace practices which contradict all relevant international
resolutions," Abdel-Meguid said after a meeting with Moratinos.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has briefed the EU envoy on the Arab stance and
a resolution adopted in the day by the 22-nation Arab organization
on the Israeli plan.
</P>
<P>
The AL has denounced the Israeli plan as having "adverse
impact" on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet on Sunday approved the plan to set up an
"umbrella authority" for Jerusalem over eight West Bank Jewish
settlements to the east, south and north of the city, which
Palestinians said would mean annexation of 18 percent of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief asked Moratinos to inform EU foreign ministers
during their meeting in Brussels Monday of the Arab stance and the
importance of EU countries' endorsement.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos arrived here early Thursday from Beirut as part of
his Mideast tour, which also includes Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit to Egypt, Moratinos will hold talks
with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on the long-running
deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He will brief Egyptian officials on the outcome of his talks in
Syria, Israel and Lebanon on reviving the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Rules Line-Item Veto Law Unconstitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Supreme Court Thursday
struck down as unconstitutional the line-item veto law that lets
the U.S. President strike out specific items in tax and spending
measures.
</P>
<P>
The high court's 6-3 decision said the law violates that part
of the Constitution requiring every bill to be presented to the
president for his approval or veto.
</P>
<P>
The court said that type of line-item veto can be authorized
only through a constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
The line-item veto law was challenged by New York City and an
Idaho potato growers' group after provisions they sought were
vetoed by President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was the first president to exercise a line-item veto,
the authority sought by nearly every president this century as a
tool to limit pork-barrel spending.
</P>
<P>
Congress voted in 1996 to give the president such authority,
and Clinton used the veto 82 times last year.
</P>
<P>
A federal judge ruled the line-item veto unconstitutional in
February, saying Congress could not delegate such authority to the
president.
</P>
<P>
The line-item veto law let the president sign a bill and within
five days go back to reject specific spending items or tax breaks
in it. Congress then could reinstate the item by passing a
separate bill.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the line-item veto argued that once a law is
signed by the president, it can be changed only in the way
prescribed by the Constitution for enacting a law -- a
congressional vote followed by the president's signature. Once the
president has exercised a line-item veto, the final law would not
be the same as the measure approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration contended a line-item veto would not
actually repeal part of a law, but would be a presidential exercise
of spending authority delegated by Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court said the administration and the veto law's
backers in Congress were wrong.
</P>
<P>
Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens concluded that
"the procedures authorized by the line-item veto act are not
authorized by the Constitution."
</P>
<P>
In ruling the line-item veto law unconstitutional last February,
U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan said it amounted to a surrender
by Congress of an "inherently legislative function" to the
president. Once a bill becomes law, the president's sole duty is to
carry it out, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld that ruling.

UNITED NATIONS, June 25 (xinhua) -- Sierra Leone is confronted
with enormous political, military, humanitarian and development
challenges, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs
Sergio Viera de Mello said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Security Council of the United Nations, Mello
said Sierra Leone continues to rely upon external actors to
provide for its security as it possesses neither an army nor an
effective police force.
</P>
<P>
Mello, who paid a recent visit to Sierra leone, said Rebel
forces in the country have embarked on a horrific campaign to
terrorize the population and destabilize the country through the
deliberate maiming and amputation of innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
He noted adequate financial support from the international
community has yet to materialize, and the country is in a very
fragile situation which requires the urgent and comprehensive
support of the United Nations and the international community if
it is to gradually return to normality and stability.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Under-Secretary-General said that the recommendations
by the U.N. chief on strengthening U.N. peacekeeping role in Sierra
Leone seen as a significant and timely development deserve the
urgent favorable consideration of the Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Queen Opens New British Library </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Queen Elizabeth officially opened
the new British Library in London on Thursday following 36 years
of work.
</P>
<P>
She said: "I have now toured this remarkable building, and to
my mind it is truly worthy of our country's contribution to
literature and scholarship, to science and technology; a
contribution which has been, and still is, second to none."
</P>
<P>
The 520 million pound (870 million U.S. dollars) library,
housed in a red brick building near London's St Pancras railway
station, is one of Britain's most expensive public buildings this
century.
</P>
<P>
It contains 20 million books and documents, including two of
the four copies of the Magna Carta and the only surviving
manuscript of "Beowulf."
</P>
<P>
The project was first mooted after World War Two and design
work started 22 years ago. But it was dogged by delays, rising
costs and technical problems and will not be fully operational
until 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the new library, it takes only 30 minutes to retrieve books
from underground shelves instead of an average two-hour wait in
the old premises.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Says Russia Against Military Action in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said here Thursday that Russia was against any NATO
military intervention in Kosovo and blamed ethnic Albanians for
hindering the Russian peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on a visit to London, Primakov warned
against any military action in Kosovo without the permission of
the U.N. Security Council, saying it would destroy Russian
cooperation with NATO.
</P>
<P>
Primakov noted that the international community did not face a
choice between military action and throwing up its hands in
resignation.
</P>
<P>
"There are those who believe that it is time to strike and to
use force. If this force is applied against a sovereign state, a
U.N. member, without the sanction of the Security Council of its
decision, this is unthinkable," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To use force in circumvention of the Security Council would
change the entire international set-up. This would create in our
country such a sentiment that would push us far away from
cooperation with NATO and would nullify all the careful
preparation done in the (NATO-Russia) Founding Act," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Primakov said that divisions among the ethnic
Albanians were hampering the Russian-sponsored peace drive aimed
at bringing peace back to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said the situation in Kosovo was complicated by
divisions between Kosovar political leader Ibrahim Rugova and the
radical Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) guerrillas, who control
nearly one third of the province.
</P>
<P>
However, the Russian minister stressed that Russia was trying
to find a political settlement by peaceful means that would
stabilize Kosovo and grant the Kosovar Albanians autonomy.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah, Israel Exchange Corpses of Dead Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's Hezbollah (Party of God)
and Israel Thursday exchanged their fighters' corpses held by each
other under the auspices of the International Committee for the
Red Cross (ICRC).
</P>
<P>
A French military plane took the mutilated remains of Israeli
sergeant Itamar Ilya from the Beirut International Airport to Tel
Aviv via Cyprus and returned later with 40 bodies of Lebanese
guerrillas killed in attacks in the Israeli occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Lebanese guerrillas included 28 from Hezbollah,
nine from Lebanon's another anti-Israeli Muslim group Amal led by
House Speaker Nabih Berri and three from Lebanese Communist
Party.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony at the airport to welcome the arrival of
the 40 dead bodies, Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri said that
it's the first time since Israeli occupation of south Lebanon
began that the Lebanese government assumes the sole role in the
name of Lebanon for conducting the negotiations on the swap of
fighters' corpses with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He called those Lebanese fighters "the country's heroes,"
saying they gave their lives to safeguard their nation's right to
live in freedom and dignity.
</P>
<P>
The honor guards stood in formation to welcome the remains of
the fighters. Outside the airport, thousands of Muslim people
have been waiting for more than two hours, banners with
black-and-yellow Hezbollah insignia in their hands.
</P>
<P>
Ilya was one of the 12 Israeli soldiers killed in a bungled
commando raid in a southern Lebanese village of Insariyeh last
September.
</P>
<P>
His remains which Israeli helicopter failed to pick up from
the battle field were jointly held by Hezbollah and Amal.
</P>
<P>
The part of Ilya's scalp Amal is holding is not included in the
exchange as the group disagreed with Israel over the number and
names of Lebanese prisoners to be released from Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah sources said the exchange operation came after nine
months of tortuous negotiations between the two parties and they
credited the success of the exchange to the great efforts the ICRC
has played in coordination with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
They described the swap, the second between Hezbollah and
Israel in two years, as a "great victory" for the country's
resistance movement, Lebanese people and the nation's unity.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its northern
settlements from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's anti-occupation movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has never stopped military resistance against Israel's
2,000 troops in south Lebanon and incurred heavy losses on them.
</P>
<P>
The swap for the return of Ilya's remains will also include the
release of 60 Lebanese prisoners, 10 from Israeli jails and the
other 50 from Khiam prison in south Lebanon run by Israeli allied
militia South Lebanese Army.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to be freed and sent home by the ICRC through
the Kfar Falous crossing that links the enclave to the rest of
Lebanon on Friday.

UNITED NATIONS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- As a result of the civil
war in Burundi, over a million Burundians or approximately one
sixth of the country's population now live outside their homes, U.N.
Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Sergio Vieira de
Mello told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mello, who has just paid a visit to Burundi, said with nearly
670,000 people living in over 300 camps within its borders,
Burundi hosts the largest internally displaced population in the
Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Mello said the five western-most provinces, which are
chronically unstable due to recurrent rebel activity and military
operations, hold over seventy percent of the country's
displaced population.
</P>
<P>
He said Burundi has also produced the highest number of
refugees in the region, with nearly 300,000 people living in the
neighboring countries of Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of
the Congo and Rwanda, and Tanzania is the host to the largest
number of Burundi refugees and has paid a high price in terms of
environmental damage and exacerbated tension with its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Mello predicted that the situation is unlikely to improve in
the near future, as continued instability prevents the majority
of the affected population from returning to their homes.

<HEADLINE> US House Committee Approves China's MFN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- As U.S. President Bill Clinton
is on a nine-day visit to China, a powerful committee of the House
of Representatives voted Thursday to back his decision to renew
China's most-favored nation (MFN) trading status.
</P>
<P>
The Ways and Means Committee decided by voice to support the
president's June 3 decision on the renewal of China's MFN for
another year and urged fellow lawmakers to reject attempts to
sever normal trade relations with that Asian country.
</P>
<P>
The vote took place following a short debate on a resolution
that would overturn the president's decision. The committee
recommended to the full House of Representatives that lawmakers
vote against the resolution and support normal trade with China.
</P>
<P>
The committee took the step hours after President Clinton
arrived in Xi'an, China's historical capital and the first stop of
the president's current trip. Clinton said at a welcoming ceremony
that "There may be those here and back in America who wonder
whether closer ties and deeper friendship between America and
China are good. Clearly, the answer is yes."
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Bill Archer, a Texas Republican, said:"I am
opposed to this resolution because it essentially would terminate
U.S. trade relations With China, and extinguish our ability to
improve the human rights situation there."
</P>
<P>
Opponents argued that the United States should suspend normal
trade relations with China until that Asian country improve its
record on human rights, forced abortions, religious persecutions
and proliferation.
</P>
<P>
However, Archer and many others believed that MFN does not give
China any special trade privileges but continues a trade status
that has been extended to almost every other country in the world.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that denying normal trade relations with China
would be counterproductive and unlikely to achieve what the
opponents want.
</P>
<P>
Philip Crane, an Illinois Republican, said:"As one of the
world's oldest and most influential civilizations, China will not
respond to shrill threats from Congress to extinguish trade."
</P>
<P>
Congress is investigating the alleged transfer of sensitive
missile technology to China by a U.S. company that launched
satellites atop Chinese rockets and illegal Chinese campaign
contributions to Democrats in 1996. China and the American company
have denied any wrongdoings and demanded the continuation of
normal trade relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, is among the
first group of lawmakers who came up to support the president soon
after he made his decision public three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
"There are no practical grounds for cutting off American
producers, American agriculture, American companies," Gingrich
said. "I would argue that if you believe in democracy it is better
to have Americans in China doing business than it is to cut the
Chinese off from contact with the American people."
</P>
<P>
Congress has 90 days to endorse or overturn the president's
decision. Some predict that MFN will be accorded to China at last,
but it might be more difficult to achieve this year because of the
ongoing Congress investigation.
</P>
<P>
However the powerful speaker, critical of the president on many
issues, told a press conference that "it will pass and I think we
may have a better vote than people expect."
</P>
<P>
It is believed that revoking China's MFN would hurt both
because tariff on goods imported from China would soar to an
average 40 percent from a current level of about 6 percent and
prices would rise.
</P>
<P>
The United States is China's second largest trading partner and
China is America's fourth largest. Their trade volume totaled 72
billion U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton told his Chinese hosts in Xi'an that "We have
a powerful ability to help each other grow. We can learn much from
each other. And as two great nations, we have a special
responsibility to the future of the world."

<HEADLINE> Germany Qualify for Second Round in World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTPELLIER, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Powerhouse Germany reached the
second round of the soccer World Cup finals after beating Iran 2-0 in
their last group F game here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Germany opened the scoring through Olivier Bierhoff, who headed
home a pass from Thomas Hassler five minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
Captain Jurgen Klinsmann showed his killer instinct in front of the
Iranian goal seven minutes later but this time Bierhoff was also
involved.
</P>
<P>
Bierhoff, who plays in Italian club Udinese, blasted a powerful
shot against the left-hand post. The ball rebounded towards Tottenham
Hotspur striker Klinsmann, who surged ahead to head it home.
</P>
<P>
Bierhoff almost made it 3-0 for Germany in the 60th minute but his
shot went wide past right post.
</P>
<P>
Iran's best chance came midway through the second half, when a shot
from Mehdi Mahdavikia was saved by German keeper Andreas Kopke.
</P>
<P>
The Iranians, who apparently wanted to play a game mainly based on
fast counter-attacks, were helpless through the first half before a
strong German defence.
</P>
<P>
After trailing two goals behind, Iran began to attack more
aggressively and had several chances in the front, but their strikers
lacked enough finishing power to materialize them.
</P>
<P>
Germany, who finished atop the group, would face group E runners-up
Mexico in the second round in Montpellier on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia also qualified by placing second in the group after
beating the United states 1-0 in another match on Thursday. They will
face group E winners the Netherlands in Toulouse also on Monday.

LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) appealed to
the Cambodian government Thursday to ensure that the elections due

conducive to free and fair elections," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that EU would further encourage the
Cambodian government "to prevent any form of political
intimidation, violence, or malpractice in the election process and
to ensure that opposition leaders and their parties are given fair
access to the media."
</P>
<P>
"The European Union believes that successful elections would
mark an important step in Cambodia's political and economic
development," it added
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the EU has provided 11 million U.S.
dollars in assistance to create the conditions for fair and free

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Qualify with 1-0 Win over United States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NANTES, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia qualified as the runners-up
of Group F after beating the United States 1-0 here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Only four minutes into the match, Savo Milosevic fired in a
powerful free-kick which was palmed away by American goal-keeper
Brad Friedel. Slobodan Komljenovc was just at the right place at
the moment and headed home to give the Yugoslav team the 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
The American team played a high-spirited game and threatened the
Yugoslav goal. Joe-Max-Moore and Brian McBride combined well and
surprised their opponents with blistering runs into the Yugoslavian
area.
</P>
<P>
But poor finishing failed them and they almost fell 2-0 behind
at the end of the first half when Milosevic ws tripped over the ball
in the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia strengthened their midfield and pushed players
forward, trying to get more goals to qualify for the last 16 as
group leaders.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Jugovic and Milosevic kept a constant pressure on the
American defence. Sinisa Mihajlovic curled a free-kick around the
wall, but Friedel scooped up the ball.
</P>
<P>
The Americans didn't give up and McBride nearly scored but his
low driving shot was collected by Yugoslav goal-keeper.
</P>
<P>
The 1-0 win is enough for the Yugoslav team to qualify, but as
the runners-up of the group. In a other Group F match, Germany beat
Iran 2-0 and advance into the last 16 as group winners due to better
goal difference.
